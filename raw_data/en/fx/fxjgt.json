SARI caused by RSV also contributes considerably to mortality amongst infants and young children. In 2015, 33.1 million RSV infections were reported worldwide in children under the age of five. Of these 33.1 million individuals, an estimated 94,000-149,400 did not survive the infection [2]. In the Netherlands, approximately 28,000 infants need medical care for RSV bronchiolitis of whom 2,000 require hospitalization [3,4]. Deaths due to RSV infection among newborns and infants are mostly seen in low- to middle-income countries, as there is often a lack of basic medical care [5]. Indeed, in the US, mortality due to RSV infection among children less than 1 year of age is comparatively low [6]. By the age of two, nearly all children have been infected with RSV at least once, and by the age of five, the average child will have suffered from an RSV infection 3-5 times [7]. This means that infection at young age does not provide life-long protection against RSV and re-infections will likely occur several times throughout the lifespan [2,8]. Moreover, RSV infection early in life may have implications for long-term respiratory health. Several studies suggest that early exposure to RSV infection may be associated with long-term respiratory problems, including recurrent wheezing and asthma [9,10]. RSV also causes serious illness among the elderly and immunocompromised individuals. However, the exact prevalence and impact of RSV infection in these population groups is unknown due to certain limitations in the diagnosis of RSV disease. Nonetheless, researchers have become increasingly aware that RSV does represent a serious threat to the elderly population [6,11]. For instance, Thompson et al. estimated that annually in the US approximately 10,000 all-cause deaths among individuals above 64 years of age can be attributed to RSV [6]. Likewise, Falsey et al. extrapolated from a prognostic study an annual number of 14,000 fatalities in the US in this age category due to RSV [12]. A more recent study by Matias et al., based on mathematical modeling, arrives at an annual mortality rate due to RSV among elderly 65 years of age or older in the US ranging from 6,200 - 17,200 depending on the outcome definition, compared to 10,700 - 28,200 deaths in the same population due to influenza [14]. In addition, it is likely that the burden of disease due to RSV infection among the elderly is underestimated. Available diagnostics to detect RSV infection are insensitive because of low virus shedding [13,14]. Illness as a result of an RSV infection often goes unrecognized or is misdiagnosed, as symptoms are indistinct from other illnesses, such as influenza [15]. This may lead physicians to preferentially diagnose influenza among the elderly. Therefore, it is likely that part of the recorded elderly deaths attributed to influenza have actually been due to RSV infection. Introduction and scope of the thesis11 ONEThere is also a high RSV-associated disease burden related to hospitalization and economic costs. For example, Falsey et al. estimates an annual hospitalization rate of 200,000 in the US due to RSV. Additionally, in the US alone, treatment and hospitalization costs due to RSV infection exceed $1 billion every year [12]. Clearly prevention of RSV infection by vaccination has an enormous potential for improvement of health amongst the most vulnerable in society, infants and the elderly, [16]. Indeed, the development of an effective vaccine against RSV would contribute to a considerable reduction in global infection and mortality rates, and lower the costs associated with hospitalization and treatment in the near future. Unfortunately, to date, there is no such licensed RSV vaccine. The studies described in this thesis involve the development of an inactivated RSV vaccine, specifically aimed at the elderly and at infants, the latter through vaccination of pregnant women, as discussed in more detail below. pathogenesis and treatment of RSV infection RSV is transmitted via droplets or contaminated surfaces to the nose or eye. RSV infects ciliated epithelium in the upper and lower respiratory tract. The virus starts replication in the nasopharyngeal epithelium in the upper respiratory tract from where it may subsequently move to the lower respiratory tract after one to three days [17-20]. RSV-infected cells express the viral fusion (F) glycoprotein on the plasma membrane, which can mediate fusion of infected cells with non-infected cells [21]. This can lead to the formation of syncytia, which are large masses of cells with multiple nuclei. The formation of syncytia induces mucus secretion in the airways, which may subsequently lead to airway obstruction [20]. In general, it can take four to eight weeks after initiation of the infection until the airway epithelium is fully restored [20]. p athogenesis among infants As mentioned before, RSV will infect approximately 90% of children by their second birthday, most commonly presented as a lower respiratory tract infection or bronchitis [22]. Symptoms can mimic those of the common cold, with a precursory fever that in a few days develops into coughing or wheezing [23]. Infants and children with cystic fibrosis, premature birth, congenital heart defects or immunosuppression are particularly at risk of contracting severe cases of SARI due to RSV, including bronchitis and pneumonia [24]. Moreover, RSV can lead to the development of asthma and hypersensitivity after early infection [9,25].Chapter 112 ONEpathogenesis among the elderly Though many view RSV as a disease affecting infants, individuals can \u2014 and often are \u2014 infected throughout their adult life. RSV does not present serious problems for most healthy adults. It usually just causes an upper respiratory tract infection with mild symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue and running nose lasting five to eight days [26]. Many individuals even remain entirely asymptomatic. As adults age and become elderly, though, RSV becomes more strenuous on their bodies and immune systems. RSV manifests itself in elderly populations with symptoms similar to those of influenza, which can lead to severe disease, pneumonia, and even death. These risks are amplified in individuals with underlying cardiovascular disease or pulmonary pathology, and in individuals taking immunosuppressive medication [13]. Unfortunately, since RSV's symptoms mirror those of influenza and other respiratory infectious agents, it can often be misdiagnosed and unreported \u2014 especially since RSV is mostly associated with infants. As the global elderly population grows in both raw numbers and relative proportion of the population, this perspective is changing. Nursing homes already report that 5-10% of their residents are infected with RSV each year, of whom 10% will develop pneumonia [23,27]. These numbers can be expected to grow as more attention is drawn to RSV and it is no longer misdiagnosed as influenza. Treatment of RSV infection Currently, the monoclonal antibody Palivizumab is registered for prophylactic administration to young infants in high-risk groups [28-30]. A large clinical study showed a reduction of 55% in the rate of hospitalization for RSV in preterm infants compared to placebo. Palivizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against the F envelope glycoprotein of RSV and needs to be administered at regular intervals of one month. However, monthly administration of this antibody is very costly, which limits its use. Also, the treatment appears to be of limited value in established infections [28,31,32]. Currently, there is no registered RSV treatment for the elderly. Treatment mostly consists of symptomatic relief and includes administration of fluids, supplemental oxygen and bronchodilators [33]. Introduction and scope of the thesis13 ONEVirus structure and cell entry RSV was first discovered in 1955 as the so-called Chimpanzee Coryza Agent but its biochemical and molecular characterization remained unknown for many years due to its relatively inefficient growth in cell culture and its physical instability [34]. The first written description of a bronchiolitis syndrome appeared in 1862 [35], but it was not until 1956 that RSV was first associated with bronchiolitis in children [34]. Taxonomy and structure of the virus RSV is an enveloped, single-stranded negative-sense RNA virus, that belongs to the Orthopneumovirus genus of the Pneumoviridae family [36]. There are two main antigenic subtypes of RSV: RSV and RSV B. RSV virus particles are pleiomorphic. Virions produced in cell culture consist of mostly spherical particles of 100-350 nm in diameter and long filaments of 60-200 nm in diameter and up to 10 \u00b5m in length [37]. It has been shown that the filamentous particles are more infectious than the spherical particles [38]. The nucleocapsid of the virus is packaged in a lipid envelope, which is derived from the host cell plasma membrane. This lipid envelope contains the viral F and G glycoproteins and the small hydrophobic SH protein. The RSV genome is 15,222 nucleotides long, transcribed from the 3' end to the 5' end, and encodes 11 proteins. There are four nucleocapsid/polymerase proteins: the nucleoprotein N, the phosphoprotein P, the transcription factor M2-1, and the large polymerase subunit L. The genes encoding the viral proteins are oriented in the order NS1, NS2, N, P, M, SH, G, F, M2 and L. The first two genes, encoding the non-structural proteins NS1 and NS2, are located at the 3'end of the genome and are the most abundantly transcribed proteins. These two proteins have been shown to suppress the host's antiviral interferon response, which allows RSV to rapidly replicate and spread among lung epithelial cells [39,40]. The other proteins encoded on the genome include the structural proteins of the virus and participate in replication of the viral genome, nucleocapsid formation, budding, and entry into the host cells. Viral Attachment, Fusion, and Entry As indicated above, RSV infects the airway epithelium. This involves attachment of the G envelope glycoprotein to cell-surface receptors followed by binding of the F protein to the cell plasma membrane to induce fusion with the target cell. The main target receptor for RSV G protein seems to be the CX3CR1 chemokine receptor [41,42]. RSV-G competes with the chemokine CX3CL1 which is also known as fractalkine. Besides the CX3CR1 receptor, two other molecules, Surfactant Protein A and Annexin II have also been identified as potential RSV G receptors [41]. While the G protein obviously is important for infection, it is not mandatory. Experiments, in vitro and in vivo, with an RSV mutant lacking the G protein showed that the virus was still able to infect epithelial cells, but at a reduced level Chapter 114 ONE[43-45]. The G protein is heavily glycosylated and highly variable in sequence between RSV strains, the latter in contrast to the F protein. The F glycoprotein is the most conserved protein between virus strains. In contrast to G, F is absolutely required for infection. The F glycoprotein mediates fusion of the viral membrane with the host cell membrane. The mature F protein spike on the viral membrane is a homotrimer, consisting of three monomers, each of which in turn consists of an F1 and F2 subunit. F is produced in the infected cell as a precursor protein F0, which undergoes a process of proteolytic cleavage after the protein has passed through the Golgi system, to form F1 and F2 [41]. The mature F glycoprotein is produced in a metastable prefusion form (preF). It is this preF conformation of the trimer that is required for viral entry into the host cell. The fusion process between viral envelope and cell plasma membrane is driven by a major conformational change of F from its preF conformation to the postfusion form (postF). F also facilitates cell-cell fusion when it is expressed on infected cells, which leads to the formation of syncytia [21]. Several surface receptors have been identified that might be involved in interaction of RSV F with the target cell membrane: ICAM-1, TLR4 and nucleolin [41]. As indicated above, during the fusion process, preF flips into the postF conformation. The postF preF (~11 nm) [46]. What exactly triggers the F protein to spontaneously rearrange and transition from the preF conformation to the postF form is unknown. As discussed in more detail below, both F and G induce virus-neutralizing (VN) antibodies upon infection which makes them superior RSV vaccine targets [21]. Antibodies against RSV G block receptor binding of the virus, while antibodies against F inhibit fusion. Clearly, only antibodies that are able to bind to the preF conformation of F are able to inhibit fusion of the virus with its target cell. Antibodies directed against postF may also inhibit fusion, but only inasmuch these antibodies are directed against epitopes that are shared between preF and postF, such that they will also bind to preF. One such shared epitope is the well-known antigenic site II. The function of the third envelope protein, the SH (small hydrophobic) protein, is not well understood. It forms an ion channel that spans the viral membrane [21,47]. It is not required for virus entry and antibodies against this envelope protein do not neutralize RSV.Introduction and scope of the thesis15 ONE A B FIGURE 1 | RSV particle and proteins.

Chapter 116 ONEImmunity to RSV infection T cell immunity and virus-neutralizing antibodies Activation of the adaptive immunity depends on the efficiency of the innate immune response. In the interaction between the innate and adaptive immune response, cells of the innate immune system, e.g. antigen-presenting cells (APC) such as dendritic cells (DCs), play a critical role. For example, DCs migrate to local draining lymph nodes where they activate CD4 and CD8 T cells. CD4 T cells recognize RSV antigen-derived peptides in the context of MHC class II molecules, while CD8 T cells recognize peptides presented by MHC class I molecules [48]. Together with co-expressed costimulatory molecules and DC cytokines this will lead to T cell activation. B cells recognize RSV antigen by means of their surface immunoglobulin receptor. CD4 T cells will provide further help in B cell and CD8 T cell activation and expansion by cell-to-cell interaction and secretion of cytokines. B cells will then become antibody-secreting cells producing virus-neutralizing antibodies, as further discussed below. CD8 T cells armed with the ability to recognize and kill virus-infected cells are critical in the clearance of virus-infected cells. CD4 T cells can further differentiate into subsets, like T helper 1 (Th1) and Th2, but also Th17 and regulatory T cells (Tregs), all with specific specialized functions [48]. Notably, Th2 CD4 T cells have been found to be associated with enhanced respiratory disease (ERD) upon RSV infection, as will be discussed in more detail later on. On the other hand, Th1 CD4 T cells help to decrease severe RSV disease and assist in clearance of virus infection. It has been suggested that during RSV infection, Tregs are responsible for limiting tissue damage as well as inflammation [49]. Besides that, Th17 cells may play a role in RSV-induced disease severity [49]. However, the roles of Tregs and Th17 during RSV infection are not completely understood yet [49]. Virus-neutralizing (VN) antibodies against RSV are able to provide protection against infection and reinfection. In the majority of individuals, the VN antibody levels induced by natural infection with RSV fall rapidly by a factor of four within a few months post-infection [50]. It has been observed that individuals with high levels of natural anti-RSV serum antibodies are not reliably protected against nasal infection [51]. Also, some individuals with low VN antibody titers were resistant to RSV infection [52]. This could suggests that, besides VN antibodies, antibody-independent immunity, for example T cell immunity, is also important for protection against RSV infection [53,54]. During reinfection, levels of VN antibodies rise faster compared to the response to a primary infection, which helps to prevent severe disease and contributes to a milder course of disease during secondary infection [55]. In adults, RSV infection induces a rise in antibody levels, which declines within 2 years to a non-sufficient protection level [50,55]. Introduction and scope of the thesis17 ONEAs mentioned previously, the F protein is required for fusion and entry of RSV into host cells and is highly conserved. It displays several virus-neutralizing epitopes and therefore is a primary antigen target for vaccine development [56]. Currently, six known antigenic sites on the F protein are associated with virus neutralization: antigenic sites \u00d8, I, II, III, IV and V (Figure 2). Antibodies that bind to antigenic site \u00d8 have a neutralizing potency 10-100x greater than that of Palivizumab [57]. As indicated above, the induction of strongly neutralizing antibodies is of utmost importance as they can diminish the number of newly infected cells from the onset of infection and thus delay the spread of the virus into the lower airways. FIGURE 2 | Antigenic sites of the RSV F glycoprotein for the binding of neutralizing antibodies. Antigenic sites \u00d8 and V are only present on preF and antigenic sites II and IV are shared between preF and postF. The most potent monoclonal antibodies bind to the apex of the preF conformation, followed by antibodies directed against antigenic sites III, IV, II, with antigenic site I being the least potent antibody neutralization site. Reprinted from Current Opinion in Virology, Vol number 23, BS Graham, Vaccine development for respiratory syncytial virus, 107-112, 2017, with permission from Elsevier Modulation of the immune response by RSV As described previously, all children have been infected by RSV by the age of 2 years, yet, this does not lead to lifelong protection and multiple re-infections may occur throughout an individual's lifetime. The lack of lifelong RSV immunity is perplexing, particularly because the virus shows little genetic variation. This could suggest that the virus exploits a variety of mechanisms for immune avoidance. One possible mechanism could be an ineffective primary infection in the presence of low levels of residual maternal RSV antibodies, which would not lead to a sustained immunity [54]. Additionally, even an effective primary infection does not lead to life-long protection as immunity to the virus appears to wane over time.Chapter 118 ONEAnother mechanism for immune avoidance is the immune modulation induced by a number of RSV proteins. One example is the suppression of the production of type-I interferons (IFN) in epithelial cells by the nonstructural proteins NS1 and NS2 [58]. An impaired expression of type I IFN may inhibit adequate cytotoxic T cell (CTL) priming, which will impact on viral clearance by these cells [53,59]. Studies show that immunocompromised individuals, with an impaired T cell immunity, suffer from severe disease and virus shedding [53]. Also, the suppression of type-I interferon production by NS1 and NS2 can impact the magnitude of CD8+ T cell responses. CD8+ T cells need three signals to become fully activated: 1. antigen, 2. co-stimulation, and 3. cytokines [60]. One of these signals, signal 3, is represented by the cytokines IL-12 or IFNs. These cytokines function as important cell survival signals to CD8+ T cells [60]. Thus, suppression of type-I interferon production by NS1 and NS2 will lead to a suppressed activation of CD8+ T cells. A third possibility is a potential attachment of the RSV G protein to the DC-SIGN receptor of Dendritic Cells (DCs), inhibiting DC activation [61]. Through this mechanism, RSV-specific immunity could be restrained. Moreover, the RSV G protein contains a conserved domain that is similar to that of the CX3CL1 chemokine fractalkine [62]. It has been suggested that the interaction of the RSV G with the CX3CR1 receptor not only facilitates infection but also modulates the immune response [62]. Indeed, Varga et al. proposed that RSV G may serve as a receptor agonist inducing attraction of neutrophils and eosinophils and is able to modulate local inflammation in the lung [49]. Additionally, experiments in mice infected with a wild-type RSV showed a skewing towards a Th2 response and decreased Th1 responses. Also, a reduced CD8 T-cell response was measured in murine lungs after infection with RSV with intact G protein compared to mice that were infected with recombinant RSV lacking the G protein [49]. RSV possibly takes advantage of several more mechanisms and it is likely that a combination of these immunosuppressive mechanisms represents the reason why natural RSV infection does not lead to lifelong immunity against re-infection in infected and convalescent individuals. Immature immune response in infants Due to RSV, newborns have a threefold higher risk of hospitalization in the first six months of their lives than in the second six months [63]. The susceptibility of this vulnerable group to infection is due to the immaturity of the newborns' immune system, which is not quickly primed to respond to harmful pathogens [64]. It is interesting to compare both the innate and adaptive immunity of infants to that of adults to determine the weaknesses in the infant's immune system. The innate immune system is present even before birth, and is formed, in part, by neutrophils. They are the first responding inflammatory cells that migrate to the site of an infection [65]. In newborns, high levels of circulating peripheral neutrophils are present, but these levels diminish within the first weeks of life to a level equal to that of adults Introduction and scope of the thesis19 ONE[65]. Regardless of the normal level of circulating neutrophils, in newborns the cells are impaired in endothelial adherence, endothelial migration, chemotaxis, phagocytosis, intracellular killing, and apoptosis [65]. The neutrophil dysfunction can put infants at risk during severe infections [65]. Antigen-presenting cells (APCs), such as monocytes, connect the innate with the adaptive immune system. After birth, the number of APCs present in newborns is comparable to that in adults. However, newborn APCs can have an impairment in their capacity to migrate to the site of inflammation and in their phagocytic activity [66]. Monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DCs) from newborns have a defective production of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and upregulation of co-stimulatory molecules compared to DCs from adults [66]. This defective response can lead to an impaired stimulation of T-cell activation and proliferation. After birth, neonates have a poorly developed Th1 response with low amounts of TNF, IFN and IL-12, which results in deficiencies in the CTL responses [66,67]. This deficient Th1 response is probably due to the limited exposure to antigens and the sterile environment in utero. A deficient Th1 response is of importance to protect the fetus from inducing alloimmune reactions between mother and fetus both in mice and humans [66]. This is probably the reason why the immune response of newborns is shifted towards a Th2-biased response. In the adaptive immune system, na\u00efve B cells in the spleen of newborns have a decreased expression of CD21, CD40, CD80 and CD86 compared to that in adults. The low levels of the costimulatory molecule CD40 leads to inefficient activation of T cells through the T cell-expressed CD40 ligand. Further, fewer plasma cells are generated resulting in reduced IgG responses to protein antigens in newborns [67,68]. Their na\u00efve and underdeveloped immune system makes newborns particularly susceptible to severe RSV infection. The transition from the sterile environment in the uterus to a new environment is possibly one factor why this group is deficient in immune protection. It is presumably due to the decreased functions of T and B cells, that early-life immune responses are weaker and less efficient [64]. These specific characteristics of the infants' impaired immature system clearly complicate RSV vaccine development for this target group. Importantly, early immune protection is mainly based on the maternal IgG antibodies that are transferred to the fetus mostly in the third trimester of the pregnancy and after birth through breast feeding [64]. These maternal antibodies can protect infants from severe disease. In recent years, there is an increasing awareness that vaccination of pregnant women might be the key solution to protect newborns in the first few months after birth.Chapter 120 ONESenescent immune response in the elderly Aging is a complex process which is associated with a decline in health, partially attributed to defects in immunity [69]. The age-related dysfunction of the innate and adaptive immune system is often referred to as immunosenescence [70]. Due to immunosenescence in the elderly population, severe infections and lower responses to vaccination are more frequent than among younger individuals [71]. Studies in humans and animals have revealed that all parts of the immune system are affected by aging [72]. Here, a short overview is given about the impact of aging on the innate and adaptive immune system and why this is important for RSV vaccine development. The principal cellular components of the innate immune system include neutrophils, macrophages, Natural Killer (NK) cells and NKT cells. They represent the first line of defense against pathogens. Their role is to initiate inflammatory responses, to phagocytose pathogens, to provide help in clearance of virus-infected cells and to initiate migration of DCs to the site of infection. In the innate immune system of the elderly, the number of neutrophils in the peripheral circulation is comparable to that of younger individuals [71,72]. However, these neutrophils can have an impaired chemotaxis and intracellular signaling, and they are less phagocytic [71,72]. The defect in chemotaxis can lead to a decreased infiltration to the site of infection and the impaired intracellular signaling might be related to the reduced phagocytic activity of elderly neutrophils [71]. Impairment in phagocytic activity of neutrophils can result in more frequent respiratory infections [71]. Another component of the innate immune system, represented by NK cells, plays a pivotal role in the antiviral host defense. Aging results in an increase of the number of NK cells, however, the cytotoxic capacity of these cells is diminished [73]. Additionally, the number of NKT cells increases with age, but this increase is accompanied by an impaired production of IFN and chemokines [73,74]. DCs function as the interface between the innate and adaptive immune responses. DCs represent the major APCs, and are specialized in the uptake, processing and presentation of antigens to T cells. With aging, DCs may develop a defect in phagocytosis, diminished Toll-like-receptor (TLR) expression and function, and increased pro-inflammatory cytokine production [73]. In the adaptive immune response, the overall number of na\u00efve T cells is reduced with aging, but the total number of T cells remains constant [73]. The T cell receptor (TCR) diversity decreases with more than 95% in the variety of TCR-chains after the age of 70 [73]. This decrease in TCR diversity leads to a decreased viral clearance in aged mice upon influenza virus A infection [75]. An increase in numbers of T cells is seen in the memory CD4+ and CD8+ T cell compartment. Aged T cells in mice have been shown to have a poor antigen response despite their prolonged survival [73]. The gradual decrease in CD4+ and increase in CD8+ T cells (i.e. decreasing CD4/CD8 T cell ratio), in older individuals suggests an age-related unbalanced immunity. The change in CD4/CD8 T cell ratio has Introduction and scope of the thesis21 ONEbeen previously shown by others [76]. Indeed, van der Heiden et al. noticed a difference in the way middle-aged individuals with different CD4/CD8 ratios react to Varicella Zoster Virus (VZV) vaccination [77]. They found that individuals with a high CD4/CD8 T cell ratio together with low pre-vaccination VZV-specific cell-mediated immunity benefit the most from VZV vaccination. This suggests that timely vaccination in the elderly would lead to better protection. Furthermore, decreasing numbers in CD4+ T helper activity also have a negative effect on CD8+ T cell memory generation in mice [78]. In the absence of appropriate CD4+ T helper activity, CD8+ T cells can be defective in recalling memory upon the presence of antigen [78]. As with the decrease in na\u00efve T cells, the ability to generate new na\u00efve B cells from bone marrow is also reduced [73]. However, the number of memory B cells, which are mainly composed of antigen-experienced memory cells, does not decline with age [72]. Additionally, it has been observed in aged mice that the ability to produce antibodies remains intact, but the affinity and avidity of these antibodies for their antigens do decline [73]. Thus, the decrease in na\u00efve T cell numbers and the memory pool of accumulated antigen-experienced T cells contribute to the immunosenescent phenotype in the elderly. Little is known about the dysfunction of the immune system that causes symptomatic disease after RSV infection in the elderly, despite repeated exposure to the virus earlier on in life. Possibly, the severity of infection in the elderly is caused, as just described, by the defects in the immune system in combination with chronic underlying medical conditions [64]. As indicated above, elderly memory T and B cells are functional, suggesting that a vaccine candidate, such as a virus-like particle or subunit vaccine, can boost these memory responses and, thus, stimulate the production of VN antibodies. Also, timely vaccination in this target group may be important, because the age-related decrease in CD4/CD8 T cell ratio may be related to reduced response to vaccination, as discussed above. In this respect, the addition of an adjuvant may help to improve the efficiency of vaccination by improving APC activation and production of cytokines that support T cell activation.Chapter 122 ONEVaccine development Ideally, an effective RSV vaccine should induce both VN antibodies and T cells in order to rapidly respond to a natural infection. Unfortunately, despite the major impact of RSV on global health, there is no RSV vaccine available, partly due to the disastrous outcome of early vaccine studies in the 1960s. Formalin-inactivated vaccine (FI-RSV) and enhanced disease After the success of the inactivated polio vaccine consisting of formalin-treated virions [79,80], researchers used the same technology to produce an RSV vaccine by inactivating RSV with formalin. The vaccine candidate was tested in children, but the results proved disastrous. Between 1965 and 1967, four clinical trials were conducted in the United States to evaluate the protective efficacy of the new FI-RSV vaccine in seronegative infants and children [81-84]. The FI-RSV vaccine, alum-precipitated, was given intramuscularly to children six month of age and older. In the youngest cohort, involving infants ranging from two to seven months old, the vaccine did not result in protection from RSV, but by contrast led to enhanced respiratory disease (ERD) after exposure of the vaccinees to a natural RSV infection. Of the 31 infants immunized with FI-RSV, 25 required hospitalization following natural infection, and two infants - 14 and 16 months of age - died, compared to only one hospitalization out of 21 infected in the control group [81]. Pathological examination of the two infants who died showed that, in addition to the RSV infection, a bacterial pneumonia complicated the viral infection. Furthermore, lung pathology showed peribronchiolar monocytic infiltration and an excess of neutrophils, and eosinophils causing obstruction of small airways [83,85]. After the calamitous results of this first vaccine trial, the emphasis in the RSV field moved away from vaccine development towards researching the underlying mechanisms responsible for enhanced respiratory disease (ERD), with a focus on the humoral and cellular immune response. This led to the discovery that FI-RSV induces high titers of antibodies that are capable of binding to the virus, but exhibit little virus-neutralizing and fusion-inhibitory activity [86,87]. Upon RSV infection of infants, these antibodies possibly had also contributed to ERD by the formation of immune complexes [86,87]. Immune complex deposition can lead to the formation of chemotactic complement factors that can attract, for example, neutrophils [86-88]. The excess of neutrophils can cause an obstruction of the airways and increased inflammation. Moreover, studies in mice and cotton rats have shown that FI-RSV induces a Th2-biased immune response characterized by upregulation of IL-4, IL-5, IL-13 and IgE [89,90]. Specific factors that may have contributed to the development of ERD relate to the inactivation of the virus by formalin [91,92], the presence of cell culture proteins [93] and the use of the adjuvant alum [94,95]. There is also evidence that once a memory response has been established by live virus infection, FI-RSV vaccination does no longer lead to ERD Introduction and scope of the thesis23 ONE[96,97]. This is probably the reason why older children in the 1960 study did not show ERD signs upon natural infection. Thus, for direct immunization of antigen-na\u00efve infants, it is mandatory that a vaccine induces neutralizing antibodies and also induces preferably a Th1 skewed response with induction of CD8+ T cell immunity. Vaccine target groups The major target populations for an RSV vaccine are, as mentioned, infants and the elderly. There is an increasing awareness that different vaccine approaches may be needed for these different target groups. A major determinant for the choice of the vaccine modality relates to the question as to whether the subject is RSV antigen-na\u00efve and vaccination will be the first priming event, or the subject has already experienced a natural RSV infection earlier on in life. Besides infants and the elderly, a third target population can be identified for possible vaccination, i.e. pregnant women (Figure 3). While direct vaccination of infants, involving the use of a live-attenuated vaccine, as discussed below, may prove problematic, a quite viable alternative is represented by vaccination of pregnant women. Here, it is the transfer of maternal antibodies to the unborn baby that provides protection to the very young immediately after birth for a period of up to six months. The challenge overall with a vaccine is to induce an immune response that is better than that to a natural infection in order to protect from severe disease and repeated infection. This may well be achieved through bypassing of the immunosuppressive mechanisms associated with a natural RSV infection. FIGURE 3 | Target populations for RSV vaccine development.

Vaccine approaches to protect infants The tragic outcome of the first clinical trial in the late 1960s, particularly the vaccine-induced ERD [81-84], has impeded RSV vaccine development for decades. But the failure of this study has also led to extensive research on RSV, leading to more knowledge about the Chapter 124 ONEimpact of RSV infection on airway function, location of the infection, and immunological consequences of first infection in young infants. In the RSV vaccine development history, live-attenuated viruses represent the most extensively evaluated approach. The use of live-attenuated viruses offers several advantages for immunization of na\u00efve infants. First, it has been demonstrated that they do not cause vaccine-associated ERD [96]. Second, they can be delivered intranasally and, third, they broadly stimulate innate, humoral and cellular immunity [98,99]. However, with this vaccine strategy, the balance between over- and underattenuation appears to be difficult to establish [100]. Moreover, the use of a live-attenuated virus vaccine could be problematic because of the instability of the virus itself, which will probably complicate vaccine production as well as long-term storage of the final product. The first live attenuated RSV vaccine candidates were established in 1968. They were developed by either repeated passage at low temperature to yield cold-passage (cp) RSV [101] mutants [102-104]. After the first start in developing attenuated virus vaccines, several other approaches like attenuating RSV strains by reverse genetics, point mutations or gene deletion were explored and are currently in preclinical or phase 1 studies [105,106]. A preferred alternative with respect to live-attenuated virus vaccines to protect infants, is to immunize pregnant women in the last trimester. This will boost their pre-existing immunity, leading to an increased transfer of maternal antibodies that provide protection through the newborns first 5-6 months of life [107,108]. A vaccine for maternal immunization may be a subunit or virus-like particle vaccine containing the F glycoprotein in its preF conformation (or both main envelope proteins, F and G) together with an adjuvant. This vaccination strategy should induce high titers of VN antibodies with the mother to protect the newborn during the first months after birth. Vaccine approaches for the elderly and immunocompromised individuals As mentioned before, because of immunosenescence, severe disease caused by RSV in the elderly is more complex than the disease that occurs during primary infection in infants. Most of the time infection of the elderly is associated with other pulmonary or chronic cardiac diseases. A vaccine for this target group should boost pre-existing RSV immunity, in particular VN antibody responses. Clearly, the use of a live-attenuated virus would not be suitable. Indeed, already low levels of serum virus-neutralizing antibodies would prevent replication of the virus in the individual, which would result in a weak stimulation of the immune system. The best approach in the elderly is the use of a subunit or particle-based vaccine in combination with an adjuvant. The vaccine should contain mainly the prefusion form of the F protein, since this will induce more potently neutralizing antibody responses than the postfusion form of F [109]. Furthermore, incorporation of the G protein together with the F protein in a vaccine may be advantageous [110], since antibodies towards the G Introduction and scope of the thesis25 ONEprotein will block the virus from attaching to its target cell, while antibodies towards the F protein will inhibit the virus to fuse with the cell membrane. The incorporation or addition of an adjuvant to the vaccine will improve the activation of APCs [78]. Additionally, TLR-binding adjuvants can also act on APCs to produce inflammatory cytokines [78]. In mice, this leads to an improved CD4 T cell response, which has been shown to be favorable to vaccine efficacy [78]. Subunit or particle-based RSV vaccines can be divided into three categories: (i) intact purified F protein or a combination of F and G proteins, (ii) peptide fragments of F or G, and (iii) particles containing F and/or G proteins. Several RSV vaccine candidates in this category have been tested in mice and cotton rats, a few in primate models and some have reached phase I or II human clinical trials [105]. Results, however, have not always been positive and many vaccine candidates have failed for various reasons to move forward to large-scale phase III human trials. Currently, a promising subunit vaccine is a stabilized RSV F protein (DS-Cav-1) in its prefusion form with an alum adjuvant, which entered phase I human clinical trials in 2017 [105]. Current vaccine candidates A wide range of vaccine approaches have been tested or are still under development. The majority of vaccines in clinical trials are mainly based on the F protein (preF or postF) of RSV. Table 1 shows an overview of vaccines, divided by target groups, that are currently tested in clinical trials. The vaccine strategies are categorized in particle-based, subunit and live-attenuated, adapted from the 'PATH RSV vaccine and mAb snapshot' [105]. Besides these 21 vaccines, more than 20 candidates are currently in preclinical development [105]. The RSV F nanoparticle vaccine of Novavax is currently the farthest in development and has entered phase III clinical trial. Novavax is currently enrolling 8618 pregnant women for their trial study (NCT02624947), which is scheduled to be finished in June 2020. Their phase II results showed a well-tolerated and immunogenic product inducing robust antibody response when used at a dose of 120 \u00b5g of protein adjuvanted with 0.4 mg of an alum formulation. The RSV F nanoparticle was safe, immunogenic and reduced RSV infection in 330 healthy women of childbearing age [111]. Additionally, the vaccines of Janssen, Bavarian Nordic and GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) have entered phase II clinical trial. Ad26.RSV.preF (Janssen), an antigen expressed through human adenovirus type 26 produced in the PER.C6 human cell line, when given intramuscularly, was shown to elicit a durable humoral and cellular immune response for the FA2 (postF as antigen) candidate. This immune response is comparable to or higher than that against their preF candidate in 180 older adults (NCT03339713) [106]. The MVA-BN RSV vaccine of Bavarian attenuated modified vaccinia Ankara), administered intramuscularly or intranasally showed to be safe with a twofold increase in IgG and IgA titers as well as a three- to fivefold increase in T Chapter 126 ONEcell responses. Interim results of the phase II trial in 400 older adults demonstrated that MVA-BN is a well-tolerated vaccine inducing broad antibody and T cell responses after a single vaccination (NCT02873286) [106]. Finally, GSK started their phase II trials with the ChAd155-RSV, a Chimpanzee adenovirus with F, N, M2-1 insert and E1 deletion. Their phase I results (NCT02491463) showed a safe product inducing B cell responses and RSV neutralizing antibodies in 73 RSV seropositive adults [106].

Virosomes are reconstituted viral envelopes that contain the membrane glycoproteins of the virus but lack the viral nucleocapsid. Initial virosome studies, based on the influenza virus, were conducted in 1975 [112]. In that study, the influenza envelope glycoproteins hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) were purified and inserted into liposomes made from phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE). It was demonstrated that the resulting structures resembled the native influenza virus [112]. Subsequently, Stegmann et al., in our own laboratory, developed a procedure for the functional reconstitution of influenza virus envelopes based on detergent solubilization and removal, as discussed in more detail below [113]. It was demonstrated that these virosomes retained the receptor-binding and low-pH-dependent membrane-fusion capacities of the native virus [108]. Thus, influenza virosomes enter cells through receptor-mediated endocytosis and fusion from within acidic endosomes. However, since the virosomes lack the viral RNA, this does not result in infection of the target cell. On the other hand, virosome-encapsulated foreign compounds can be efficiently delivered to the cytosol of target cells through fusion from within the endosomal cell compartment [110]. In the early virosomal studies, the detergent octaethyleneglycol mono(n-dodecyl) ether (C 12E8) was used to solubilize the viral membrane prior to nucleocapsid removal [113]. During the virosomal production process, the detergent C12E8 is removed with hydrophobic beads (BioBeads SM2) which results in the formation of membrane vesicles. In a later development of virosome production, C 12E8 replaced in contrast to C 12E8, it can be removed by dialysis due to its high critical micelle concentration (cmc). The virosome concept for vaccines Reconstituted viral envelopes not only represent efficient cellular delivery vehicles, they also form the basis for a variety of vaccines, influenza vaccines in particular [109]. For example, a virosomal influenza vaccine, Inflexal V TM, has been on the market for some time [117]. Besides the HA in the virosomal membrane, other foreign antigens can be incorporated in the membrane which will be recognized by B lymphocytes. For example, influenza virosomes have been used as a carrier for Hepatitis A antigens in Epaxal\u00ae [118]. The multimeric presentation of the antigen allows efficient cross-linking of B cell receptors, which is a strong activation signal. Besides B cell stimulation, Huckriede et al. have shown that influenza virosomes are able to activate DCs. Surface expression of MHC class I, class Chapter 128 ICAM-1, CD80, CD86 CD40 was upregulated after in vitro [114]. This confirms that influenza virosomes have the capacity to induce maturation of DCs. Additionally, since fusion-active virosomes have the capacity to deliver encapsulated compounds, including antigens, to the cytosol of cells, they can also induce a class I MHC-restricted cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) virosomes are delivered to the cytoplasm of APCs, where they are processed to peptides by proteasomes [114,119]. Subsequently, antigen-derived peptides are presented in the context of MHC class I molecules to prime CTL activity [114]. Because of the fusion activity of HA and the direct access to the MHC class I presentation pathway through the cytosol, no alternative mechanisms for processing exogenous protein antigens are required. As mentioned previously, CTL activity is of importance for the clearance of virus-infected cells and virus infections. Moreover, virosomes that are degraded within the endosomal/lysosomal compartment will enter MHC class II peptide presentation to CD4 T cells. This will induce a strong T helper response which is essential for the stimulation of CTLs and the support of antibody-forming B cells. Virosomes, therefore, have the capacity to elicit a broad immune response and activate both the humoral and the cellular arm of the immune system. Finally, virosomes provide the possibility to incorporate lipophilic or amphiphilic adjuvants in the virosomal membrane. Consequently, antigen and adjuvant are contained within one particle, and are therefore delivered together to the same APC. This will result in activation and antigen presentation by the same cell. Initial RSV virosome studies After the successful development of influenza virosomes, the same technique was used to generate virosomes from purified RSV. Figure 4 represents a schematic overview on how RSV virosomes are currently produced. In the procedure, the membrane of purified virus is solubilized with DCPC and the nucleocapsid is removed via ultracentrifugation. The viral supernatant is then added to a dry lipid film consisting of PE, PC, cholesterol and an adjuvant. The film is solubilized in DCPC-containing viral supernatant, followed by dialysis. The envelope proteins, lipids and adjuvant are incorporated into the virosome's membrane during dialysis. Properly produced RSV virosomes, consist of the viral membrane lipids, envelope glycoproteins, added lipids and adjuvant, and have a diameter of about 100-150 nm. The (structural) epitopes are displayed as on the native virus, which will lead to the induction of antibodies with a proper fit and high virus-neutralizing capacity. It is therefore important to keep viral envelope glycoproteins intact in their native structure. This is particularly important for RSV vaccine development, since with the early FI-RSV vaccine, critical epitopes of the viral F glycoprotein were disrupted due to the formalin-inactivating process of the virus, which led to induction of low-affinity antibodies with Introduction and scope of the thesis29 ONEa deficient capacity to neutralize the virus, leading to ERD [120,121]. In recent years, production of RSV virosomes and the incorporation of a lipophilic adjuvant have been optimized to eventually fulfill GMP production requirements. addition of lipids and incorporation of adjuvant 3D -PHAD\u00ae Removal of DCPC by dialysis yields virosomes Solubilization in DCPC Nucleocapsid removal Separation of surface proteins and nucleocapsid FIGURE 4 | Virosome production. Reprinted from thesis T. Kamphuis (2012) with permission. Purified RSV virus is solubilized with DCPC and the nucleocapsid is removed by ultracentrifugation. Lipids and lipophilic adjuvant are added to the viral proteins. Removal of DCPC by dialysis yields virosomes. Initial studies by Stegmann et al. and Kamphuis et al. were performed with RSV virosomes with an incorporated TLR2 or TLR4 adjuvant [122-124]. When administered intramuscularly to mice, these virosomes induced protective levels of VN antibodies, a Th1-biased immune response, and no signs of ERD upon virus infection. Additionally, studies performed in cotton rats showed similar results with regards to the induction of systemic antibodies and inhibition of viral shedding in lungs upon challenging as well as no signs of ERD. Shafique et al. analyzed the immunogenicity of these virosomes through the mucosal route of vaccination [125]. In that study, mice were also protected upon virus challenge and no signs of ERD were detected. These preliminary data revealed that RSV virosomes are a promising concept for an RSV vaccine. M p LA as a vaccine adjuvant in RSV virosomes As indicated above, one of the crucial features of the use of reconstituted viral envelopes is the possibility to incorporate lipophilic or amphiphilic adjuvants in the virosomal membrane during the virosome production process. In our virosomal RSV vaccine candidate, the lipophilic adjuvant monophosphoryl lipid A (MPLA) has been mainly used as an adjuvant [126]. MPLA is a ligand for Toll-Like Receptor 4 (TLR4), and represents the Chapter 130 ONEnon-toxic lipid A region derivative of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). LPS produced, for example, by the bacteria Salmonella Minnesota, is used for the production of MPLA. MPLA itself is 10,000 times less toxic than LPS, which makes it attractive for use as an adjuvant [127]. Decades of research have been performed about the use of MPLA as an adjuvant in different vaccine formulations, and to date there are two licensed human vaccines that use MPLA as an adjuvant component \u2014 the human papillomavirus 16/18 vaccine, Cervarix\u00ae, and a hepatitis B virus vaccine, FENDrix\u00ae [128]. MPLA has been shown to boost the immune response against the antigens with which it is co-administered. Furthermore, MPLA has been tested intensively in preclinical and clinical trials for toxicity and it is registered with an acceptable safety profile in humans. FIGURE 5 | Structural formula of synthetic 3D-PHAD\u00ae [129]. Variants of MPLA with even lower toxicity levels have been developed, like 3-O-deacyl- MPLA (3-OD-MPLA), which is currently used in marketed vaccines. MPLA and 3-OD-MPLA are complex mixtures of molecules. They all contain a phosphorylated carbohydrate backbone and variable numbers of acyl chains that also vary in length. According to literature, the most active anomeric forms of MPLA are the hexa-acylated forms [130,131]. The use of a single synthetic MPLA molecule in vaccines would be advantageous in terms of GMP production, toxicity, and safety. Monophosphoryl 3-deacyl Lipid A (3D-PHAD\u00ae) is a fully synthetic molecule (see Figure 5 for molecular structure) which contains only the penta-acyl molecule, which is not the most active form of MPLA, but is safe and effective in inducing Th1-type immune responses [129].Introduction and scope of the thesis31 ONEAim and outline of the study described in this thesis The research described in this thesis focuses on the evaluation of a novel virosomal RSV candidate. Chapter 2 describes the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of RSV-derived virosomes containing the lipophilic adjuvant MPLA, which has a potentially strong Th1-skewing activity. Virosomes with incorporated MPLA were evaluated for their TLR-activating capacities ex vivo, in cultured cells, as well as for their ability to induce a protective antibody and balanced Th1/Th2-helper response in vivo, in mice. The results from the studies described in Chapter 2 were a reason to investigate the properties of MPLA involved in activation and stimulation of immune cells of mice ex vivo. Additionally, these properties were compared for two variants of MPLA: 3-O-deacyl MPLA (3-OD-MPLA) which is present in a commercially available vaccine, and a fully synthetic version of MPLA, i.e. PHAD\u00ae. In this study, presented in Chapter 3, both MPLA variants, which are less toxic than normal MPLA, were analyzed for their capacity to induce in vitro DC maturation, B cell proliferation, antibody secretion and IgG subtype switching. Next, in Chapter 4, we analyzed whether the less toxic variant of MPLA, 3D-PHAD\u00ae (a single synthetic molecule), in RSV virosomes has the same capacity to boost protective antibody responses upon immunization of mice, compared to LPS-derived MPLA (a complex mixture of molecules). Moreover, this chapter describes the induction of RSV-specific CD8+ T cells by these virosomes. We found that the fully synthetic 3D-PHAD\u00ae is an excellent replacement for the natural MPLA, since it has excellent immunostimulatory capacity and is safer and therefore preferable for future use in a GMP-produced virosomal vaccine. Chapter 5 evaluates the composition, morphology and long-term stability of RSV virosomes, containing 3D-PHAD\u00ae. In this study, we performed a quantitative analysis of the incorporation of 3D-PHAD\u00ae into virosomes. Further, the lipid composition of the virosomes was optimized and the ratio of F and G glycoprotein incorporated in the particles was determined. Finally, virosomes were analyzed for their long-term stability. In Chapter 6 we investigated the immunogenicity in vivo in mice of 3D-PHAD\u00ae-containing RSV virosomes derived from the RSV strain L19F and the mutant strain L19F I557V. These two strains are known to have higher levels of less temperature-sensitive preF in the membrane. We evaluated RSV virosomes derived from these strains in comparison with virosomes derived from RSV A2 virus, specifically for their capacity to induce preF- and postF -specific antibodies and virus-neutralizing antibodies.Chapter 132 ONEThe findings described in Chapters 2 to 5 showed that the virosomal approach with the incorporation of the synthetic MPLA, 3D-PHAD\u00ae, induces high levels of virus-neutralizing antibodies and CD8+ T-cell responses. The use of purified virus for virosome production, however, has a disadvantage. It is difficult to culture high concentrations of RSV on a commercial scale. Furthermore, since the viral F glycoprotein is metastable, it is difficult to control the ratio of preF and postF incorporated in the virosomes. We therefore, in Chapter 7, attempted to improve the virosome approach. In this study, we developed a new vaccine by using synthetic liposomal nanoparticles with a conjugated high-density array of recombinant stabilized preF or postF spikes of RSV. The use of fully synthetic lipids and adjuvant together with a recombinant protein antigen produced in cells will result in consistent vaccine quality. Moreover, the design of the particles and their protein content are flexible. These proteoliposomes were characterized and evaluated for their immunogenicity in vivo in mice. Finally, Chapter 8 discusses the most important findings presented in this thesis. Introduction and scope of the thesis33 ONE[1] Tregoning JS, Schwarze J.

To date there is no efficacious and safe RSV vaccine, partially because of the outcome of a clinical trial in the 1960s with a formalin-inactivated RSV vaccine (FI-RSV). This vaccine caused enhanced respiratory disease upon exposure to the live virus, leading to increased morbidity and the death of two children. Subsequent analyses of this incident showed that FI-RSV induces a Th2-skewed immune response together with poorly neutralizing antibodies. As a new approach, we used reconstituted RSV viral envelopes, i.e. virosomes, with incorporated monophosphoryl lipid A (MPLA) adjuvant to enhance immunogenicity and to skew the immune response towards a Th1 phenotype. Incorporation of MPLA stimulated the overall immunogenicity of the virosomes compared to non-adjuvanted virosomes in mice. Intramuscular administration of the vaccine led to the induction of RSV-specific IgG2a levels similar to those induced by inoculation of the animals with live RSV. These antibodies were able to neutralize RSV in vitro. Furthermore, MPLA-adjuvanted RSV virosomes induced high amounts of IFN and low amounts of IL5 in both spleens and lungs of immunized and subsequently challenged animals, compared to levels of these cytokines in animals vaccinated with FI-RSV, indicating a Th1-skewed response. Mice vaccinated with RSV-MPLA virosomes were protected from live RSV challenge, clearing the inoculated virus without showing signs of lung pathology. Taken together, these data demonstrate that RSV-MPLA virosomes represent a safe and efficacious vaccine candidate which warrants further evaluation.Evaluation of RSV-MPLA virosomes43 TWOIntroduction Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) is a major cause of viral brochiolitis in infants and young children and is also a significant problem in elderly and immuno-compromised adults. According to the WHO, annually 64 million people are infected with RSV, and 160,000 people die from the infection around the world [1]. It is estimated that, each year, RSV leads to 3.4 million hospitalizations of children [2]. By the age of two, nearly all children have been infected with RSV. However, natural infection does not evoke long-lasting immunity, which causes people to undergo multiple RSV infections throughout their lives. In healthy adults, RSV infection will manifest itself like a common cold, which is generally cleared within two weeks. When, at old age, the immune system weakens, RSV infections become more severe, leading to, for example, approximately 10,000 deaths in nursing homes in the US each year [3,4]. Current treatment of RSV infection in high-risk infants consists of prophylactic administration of the monoclonal antibody Palivizumab [5]. However, the high costs of monoclonal antibody therapy and the limited duration of efficacy of this treatment warrant the development of an RSV vaccine [6,7] In elderly, treatment is mainly supportive and consists of administration of fluids, oxygen and antipyretics [8]. Aerosolized Ribavirin is registered for use in some infant groups however, no significant effect has been reported in the elderly [8]. Even though the need for an RSV vaccine has been recognized for over 60 years, there is currently no licensed RSV vaccine available. This is, in part, due to the disastrous outcome of a clinical trial in the 1960s, which evaluated a formalin-inactivated, alum-adjuvanted, RSV (FI-RSV) vaccine candidate [9-12]. In this trial, children who received the vaccine developed RSV-specific antibodies, but these proved to be poorly virus-neutralizing [13,14]. Instead of preventing infection, vaccination resulted in enhanced respiratory disease (ERD) upon infection with the live virus, leading to a 16-fold increase in hospitalization and even to the death of two children in the vaccinated group [11]. After this trial, many studies have been performed to elucidate the mechanisms causing ERD upon vaccination with FI-RSV and subsequent exposure to live virus. Studies in mice, for example, showed that a Th2-like immune response accompanied by influx of eosinophils into the lungs plays a major role in ERD [15]. Another study in mice has shown that, although FI-RSV does elicit RSV-specific antibodies, these have a limited affinity for neutralizing epitopes on the RSV fusion protein due to lack of affinity maturation [16]. Therefore, a future RSV vaccine should induce a Th1-skewed response together with high levels of strongly neutralizing antibodies. A promising approach towards the development of vaccines that both skew the immune response to a Th1-type reaction and induce high-affinity antibodies is to include Toll-Like Receptor (TLR) ligands in the vaccine [17]. TLRs recognize Pathogen-Associated Molecular Patterns (PAMPs) from bacteria and viruses and subsequently signal through adaptor molecules such as MyD88 and TRIF to induce the production of inflammatory Chapter 244 TWOcytokines and type-I interferons [18]. Activation of TLR4, for example, leads to production of high amounts of IL12 and IFN resulting in a Th1-skewed immune response [19]. Importantly, a recent study showed that a UV-inactivated RSV virus, which by itself induces poorly neutralizing antibodies, will give rise to high-affinity and strongly neutralizing antibodies when supplemented with TLR ligands [16]. Using a similar approach, we recently showed that the incorporation of the TLR2 ligand P3CSK4 in an experimental virosomal RSV vaccine promotes the capacity of the vaccine to induce Th1-type cellular responses together with the induction of protective antibodies in mice and cotton rats [20]. Thus, the combination of an RSV vaccine, such as RSV virosomes, with a TLR ligand improves both the immunogenicity and the safety of the vaccine. Another promising TLR ligand candidate to be used as an adjuvant in an RSV vaccine is the TLR4 ligand monophosphoryl lipid A of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) [22]. Like LPS, MPLA also signals through TLR4. However, where TLR4 activation by LPS induces signaling through adaptor molecule MyD88, activation by MPLA leads to TRIF-mediated signaling, resulting in enhanced type I IFN production and reduced production of inflammatory cytokines compared to MyD88-mediated signaling [16,23,24]. the TLR2 ligand P3CSK4, which we used in our previous study [20], has been associated with a balanced Th1/Th2-type immune response, MPLA is thus known to induce a significantly Th1-skewed immune response [17]. Furthermore, an MPLA derivative with similar immune-potentiating properties as native MPLA has been evaluated in extensive clinical trials and has shown good efficacy combined with an acceptable safety profile for use in humans when co-administered with a variety of antigens [26]. For these reasons, MPLA is the only TLR ligand which is currently being used as an adjuvant in a number of licensed vaccines [27,28]. Importantly, the addition of MPLA to FI-RSV suppressed the expression of RSV ERD associated cytokines in the lungs of cotton rats [29]. Furthermore, it has been shown that addition of MPLA to FI-RSV promotes the immunogenicity of the vaccine and ameliorates lung pathology after challenge [30]. Thus, the favorable Th1-inducing properties of MPLA, compared to P3CSK4, combined with the available data on the inhibitory effects of this TLR ligand on the development of RSV ERD and its acceptable safety profile in humans, led us to explore MPLA as a possible adjuvant in our RSV virosomal vaccine. We exploited the lipophilic properties of MPLA to incorporate it in the virosomal membrane during the reconstitution process. These virosomes were analyzed for their immunostimulating properties and immunogenicity both in vitro and in vivo and for their capacity to induce protection against infection with live RSV. Our data show that incorporation of MPLA in RSV virosomes increases their immunostimulatory capacity in vitro, as evidenced by increased human TLR4-mediated NF-B activation and upregulation of costimulatory molecules in mouse cells. In of MPLA in RSV virosomes stimulated RSV-specific IgG IgG2a antibody Evaluation of RSV-MPLA virosomes45 TWOproduction and increased levels virus adjuvanted RSV virosomes. Also, RSV-MPLA primed for Th1-type as evidenced by high IFN levels and low IL5 levels, not only in ex vivo cultures of splenocytes from immunized mice stimulated with RSV antigen, but also in the lungs of immunized mice upon challenge with live RSV. Finally, mice vaccinated with RSV-MPLA virosomes were protected from challenge with live RSV without symptoms of ERD, as demonstrated by the absence of lung pathology and a lack of eosinophil infiltration into the lungs. Material and Methods Ethical statementAnimal experiments were evaluated and approved by the Committee for Animal Experimentation (DEC) of the University Medical Center Groningen, according to the guidelines provided by the Dutch Animal Protection Act (permit number DEC 5239A). Immunizations and challenges were conducted under isofluorane anesthesia, and every effort was made to minimize suffering. Virus and cell culture RSV strain A2 (ATCC VR1540) was kindly donated by Mymetics BV (Leiden, The Netherlands). The virus was grown in roller bottles on HEp-2 cells from Invitrogen) and 10% FBS (Lonza-Biowhittaker, Basel, Switzerland) unless stated otherwise. At 80% CPE (5 days post-infection) the medium was cleared by low-speed centrifugation. Aliquots of the supernatant were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, as a source of live virus for immunization and challenge. The remainder of the virus was pelleted by ultracentrifugation and subsequently purified on a sucrose gradient. Purified virus was snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 \u00b0C in 20% sucrose in HNE buffer (5 mM Hepes, 145 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.4). Mouse dendritic cells (DCs) were derived from bone-marrow cultures, as described before [31]. Briefly, both tibia and femurs were flushed cells were lysed by incubating the cells with ACK buffer (0.83 % NH 4Cl, 10 mM KHCO3, 0.1 mM EDTA, pH 7.2) for 5 min on ice. The cells were washed with IMDM medium and incubated in IMDM (Flt3L)(R&D systems, Abingdon, UK). Medium was replaced after 4 days and dendritic cells were harvested 8 days after initiation of the culture. HEK-Blue TLR4 and HEK-Blue Null2 cells were purchased from Invivogen (Toulouse, France) and maintained according to the manufacturer's protocol. Chapter 246 TWOVaccine production RSV virosomes were generated as described previously [20]. Briefly, purified RSV was pelleted by ultracentrifugation and dissolved 100mM 1,2 dihexanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DCPC) in HNE buffer. The nucleocapsid was removed by ultracentrifugation. Subsequently, a 2:1 molar mixture of egg phosphatidylcholine (PC) and egg phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) (Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL, USA) in 2:1 chloroform/methanol at 850 nmol/mg protein was evaporated to a dry film in a glass tube. The supernatant containing the membrane lipids and proteins was added to the lipid mixture. For incorporation of MPLA, monophosphoryl lipid A from Salmonella minnesota Re 595 (Invivogen) was first dissolved in 100 mM DCPC in HNE buffer and then added to the protein/lipid mixture at 1 mg MPLA/ mg virosomal protein. For the MPLA concentration experiment, MPLA was added in lower ratios i.e. 1:0.2, 1:0.04, 1:0.008 (mg virosomal protein to mg MPLA). The mixture was incubated for 15 min at 4C, filtered through a 0.22\u00b5m filter and dialyzed in a sterile Slide-A-lyzer (10 kD cut-off; Thermo Scientific, Geel, Belgium) against 4 x 2 liters of HNE pH 7.4 for 48 hours. After dialysis, virosomes were kept at 4C. FI-RSV vaccine was produced according to the original protocol, which was used for the 1960's FI-RSV preparation as reported in [30]. FI-RSV was diluted in HNE buffer to contain 5 \u00b5g of RSV protein in 25 \u00b5l of vaccine. In vitro analyses The virosomes were analyzed by equilibrium density gradient centrifugation on 10-60% sucrose gradients in HNE. Gradients were spun for 60 hr in an SW 55 Ti rotor at 50000 rpm and samples from the gradient were analyzed for protein, phospholipid phosphate and density (by refractometry). Each fraction was dialyzed against HNE in a Slide-A-Lyzer MINI Dialysis Device (Thermo Scientific, Geel, Belgium) overnight to remove the sucrose which is toxic for HEK-Blue cells at high concentrations. The samples were corrected for increases in volume due to the dialysis and 20\u00b5l volumes of the samples were used to stimulate HEK-Blue TLR4 cells (10 5 cells/well) and HEK blue Null2 cells (5x104 cells per well) overnight at 37C in a 96 well plate in triplicate. To quantify alkaline phosphatase production, 20 \u00b5l 180 \u00b5l Quanti-Blue (Invivogen, France) and incubated for 30 minutes at 37C. Absorbance was measured at 630 nm and plotted relative to the activation induced by 100 ng/ml of TNF. Upregulation of surface markers was assessed after incubating DCs with different virosome preparations. DCs were incubated at 1 \u00d7 10 6 cells/ml at 37 C in IMDM medium. The incubation was stopped after 24 hr by washing the cells twice in medium. Expression of surface markers was determined by staining with (6-8 weeks old)(Harlan, Zeist, The Netherlands) were used for all immunization experiments. For immunization and challenge, mice were anesthetized using 3-4.5% isoflurane in O 2. Mice received or FI-RSV intramuscularly in 25 \u00b5l HNE. Each preparation contained 5 \u00b5g of protein. Control mice received 50 \u00b5l (1*10 6 TCID50) of live RSV, intranasally or 25 \u00b5l of HNE intramuscularly. Vaccinations were given on day 0 and day 14. On day 28 mice were challenged with 10 6 TCID50 (titrated as described below) of live RSV intranasally. On time points of vaccination and challenge, blood was drawn by retro-orbital puncture. Four days after challenge, mice were sacrificed and blood was drawn by heart puncture. Spleens were harvested for analysis of RSV-specific T cell cytokine responses and lungs for analysis of pathology, determination of lung cytokines and viral titers, respectively. Virus titration Virus titers were determined by titration of the tissue-culture infectious dose (TCID 50). For challenge virus, initial dilutions of 1:5000 were made in HEp-2 medium without FBS. Serial twofold dilutions of these samples were made in 96-well plates in quadruplicate. 20,000 HEp-2 cells were added to the virus dilutions and incubated for 5 days at 37C in 5% CO 2. The cells were then fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 45 min, blocked with 2% milk powder (Protifar plus, Nutricia, Zoetermeer, The Netherlands) in PBS for 1 hr and stained with 50\u00b5l 1:400 FITC-labeled goat anti-RSV antibody (Meridian life science Inc, Saco, ME, USA) at 37C overnight. The next day, plates were washed with PBS and analyzed under a fluorescence microscope. Wells were considered positive for infection if one or more fluorescent syncytium was present. Titers were calculated using the Reed & Muench method. To determine virus titers in the lungs of challenged mice, the lungs were removed aseptically after euthanasia of the mice. Lungs were then homogenized in 1 ml of 2% FBS containing HEp-2 medium using an automated Potter homogenizer Polytron-Aggregate\u00ae (Thomas Scientific, Swedesboro, NJ, USA). Next, homogenates were centrifuged at 1400 rpm for 10 min at 4 oC, and supernatants, diluted to a 1:5 starting dilution, were used to determine viral titers using the TCID50 method as described above. In vitro neutralization assayVolumes of 100 \u00b5l of serum were heat-inactivated for 30 min at 56C and subsequently diluted with 150 \u00b5l serum-free HEp2 medium. Wells of 96-well plates were filled with 50 \u00b5l of serum free HEp2 medium. Fifty \u00b5l of diluted serum was applied to the first row of wells in quadruplicate and serial two-fold dilutions were made. Subsequently, 70 TCID 50 of live RSV was added in 50 \u00b5l of serum free HEp2 medium and incubated at 37C for 2 hr. After incubation, 20,000 HEp2 cells were added per well in 100\u00b5l of HEp2 medium with Chapter 248 TWO4% FBS. After 5 days of incubation, the cells were washed, fixed and stained as described above for the virus titration. Neutralization titer was calculated with the Reed & Muench method and is indicated as the reciprocal of the dilution that neutralizes infection in 50% of the wells. Immunological assays RSV-specific antibody titers were determined as described before [20]. Briefly, 96-well plates were coated with betapropiolactone-inactivated RSV and then blocked with 2.5% milk powder in coating buffer. Plates were then incubated for 90 min with two-fold serial dilutions of serum or broncho-alveolar lavages starting at 1:200 for serum or 1:1 for BAL. After washing, plates were incubated dilution of 1070-05, 1080-05, 1040-05, 1130-05) for 1 hr, washed again and subsequently stained with o-Phenylenediamine (OPD; Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA). After 30 min the staining was stopped by addition of 2 M H 2SO4 and absorption was measured at 492 nm. For levels of total IgG, geometric mean titers (GMT) were determined. For quantification of IgG1 and IgG2a levels, a calibration curve was used. For this, ELISA plates were coated with goat anti-mouse-IgG (heavy and light chain, human absorbed; Southern Biotech, 1031-01) at 100 ng/well in coating buffer overnight at 37 oC. After blocking with 2.5% milk powder, known concentrations of a mouse IgG1 isotype control (Southern Biotech, 1070-01) and mouse IgG2a isotype control (Southern Biotech, 0103-01) were prepared, and applied to the plates. After a 90-min incubation at 37 oC, plates were washed and stained as described above. For analysis of levels of IL5 and IFN in splenocyte cultures and lung homogenates (see below), mouse IFN and mouse IL5 high sensitivity ELISA kits (eBioscience) were used according to the manufacturer's instruction. For the analysis of IFN and IL5 secretion in the RSV-specific recall responses of splenocytes, spleens were removed four days after challenge and transferred to a 15 ml tube containing IMDM/10% FCS. The spleens were passed through a 70-\u00b5m cell strainer (BD Biosciences, Heidelberg, Germany) using sterile 3-mL syringe plungers. Erythrocytes were then lysed by incubating with ACK buffer for 5 min on ice. The cells were washed with medium, counted and seeded at 2\u00d710 6 cells/ml and stimulated with BPL-RSV (10 \u00b5g/ mL) in IMDM/10% FCS in triplicates and incubated at 37oC in a 5% CO2 atmosphere for 72 hr. Supernatants were harvested and stored at -20oC until further analysis. For analysis of IL5 and IFN levels in RSV-infected lungs, lungs were removed from challenged mice and homogenized using the method as described for virus titration (see above). IL5 and IFN levels were then determined lung of RSV-MPLA virosomes49 lobes were inflated with 4% formalin in PBS and subsequently embedded in paraffin. Four \u00b5m slices were then prepared , and stained with standard hematoxylin and eosin. After staining, lung inflammatory parameters (peribronchiolitis, perivaculitis and alveolitis) were assessed by light microscopic analysis of slides. Broncho-alveolar lavage cytospins BAL were taken by rinsing the lungs of the mice with 1 ml of PBS supplemented with protease inhibitors using a winged shielded i.v. catheter (1.3x30mm, BD Utah) inserted, through an incision, in the trachea of euthanized mice. Cells in the BAL were pelleted by low-speed centrifugation and resuspended in 500 l PBS. In some cases, the remaining BAL supernatants were used for IgA antibody assessment in ELISA. Subsequently, cells were spotted (300 rpm for 5 min) onto glass slides, air dried, and fixed in 80% methanol/20% PBS (V/V) for 10 min at -20\u00b0C. After air-drying, slides were stained for 20 min in May-Grunwald-Giemsa stain (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany), diluted 1:1 in S\u00f8rensen's phosphate buffer (0.2 M; pH 6.6). Then, slides were rinsed in S\u00f8rensen's phosphate buffer, and incubated for 15 min in Giemsa stain (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) diluted 1:8 in S\u00f8rensen's phosphate buffer. After washing with tap water, slides were air-dried and spots were sealed using cover slides and Kaiser's glycerol (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). The presence of eosinophils in cytospot BAL cells was analyzed by light microscopy. Statistical analysis All statistical analyses were performed with Graphad Prism 5.00 for Mac OSX, (GraphPad Software, San Diego California USA, www.graphpad.com. Statistical significance was assessed using a Mann-Whitney U test. A P value of 0.05 or lower was considered to represent a significant difference. Chapter 250 TWOResults Characterization of RSV-M pLA virosomes The formation of virosomes was analyzed by equilibrium density-gradient centrifugation. Protein and phosphate were found to co-migrate for RSV virosome preparations with and without MPLA, indicating successful reconstitution of the viral envelopes (Figure 1A, 1B). For RSV-MPLA virosomes, the apparent absence of phosphate outside the virosome peak indicated that MPLA was primarily associated with the virosomal membranes. In vitro analysis of RSV-M p LA virosomes To assess the immune-potentiating capacity of the RSV-MPLA virosomes, fractions from the sucrose gradient were tested for their TLR4-activating activity in HEK-Blue TLR4 cells, after dialysis to remove the sucrose. The fractions containing the non-adjuvanted virosomes induced a TLR4-mediated NF-B activation which was slightly higher than the activation induced by TNF- (Figure 1C). This activation is probably due to TLR signaling of the RSV F protein [35]. Incorporation of MPLA into the virosomes strongly stimulated TLR4 signaling by the virosomes. The fraction at the top of the gradient also induced activation of TLR4, indicating that not all the added MPLA had been inserted in to the viral envelopes (Figure 1D). Since a large proportion of the MPLA was associated with the virosomal fraction, as judged by phosphate analysis and TLR4-activating capacity of the fractions of the gradient, subsequent experiments were performed with non-fractionated virosomes. Next, virosomes were tested for their capacity to up-regulate costimulatory molecules in mouse DCs. Non-adjuvanted virosomes induced of DC maturation markers CD40, CD80 and CD86. Incorporation of MPLA in to these virosomes significantly stimulated the induction of CD40 and CD80 expression compared to RSV (Figure 1E). In vivo of the virosomes in vivo, Balb/c mice were vaccinated with RSV virosomes or RSV-MPLA virosomes at a 2-week interval. For comparison, mice were inoculated with live RSV (to induce a Th1-skewed immune response) or vaccinated twice with FI-RSV (to induce a Th2-skewed immune response). Two weeks after the first and second vaccination, blood was drawn and serum IgG titers were determined. After the priming immunization, RSV induced a mean IgG titer of 2.5 Log GMT. Incorporation of MPLA in to the virosomes resulted in significantly increased IgG levels after both priming and booster immunizations, not only compared to the levels induced by non-adjuvanted RSV virosomes but also to the levels induced by FI-RSV and live virus (Figure 2A). 01234Relative NFkB activation FIGURE | In vitro analysis of RSV and RSV-MPLA virosomes. (A, B) RSV virosomes and RSV-MPLA virosomes were spun on an equilibrium density sucrose gradient. Subsequently, density, protein concentration, and phos- phate concentrations of each fraction was determined. (C, D) Fractions from A and B were analyzed for their TLR4-signaling ability using Hek-Blue TLR4 cells. To assess non-TLR specific activation of cells, control cells (Null2 cells) were incubated with the same virosome fractions. As a control for activation both Hek blue TLR4 and Hek blue null2 cells were stimulated with 100 ng/ml TNF-. Bars represent TLR activation relative to that of the TNF- control to stimulate ex vivo cultured mouse DCs overnight. Cells were stained for expression of costimulatory molecules using specific monoclonal antibodies and analyzed by FACS. Bars represent the percentage of positive cells. The data shown are a representative of three individual experiments. Next, RSV-specific IgG1 and IgG2a subtype levels were determined. RSV-MPLA virosomes significantly higher levels of IgG2a compared to non-adjuvanted virosomes, reaching similar levels of RSV-specific IgG2a as seen after live virus inoculation (Figure 2B). In parallel with the increased RSV-specific IgG2a responses, increases in RSV-specific IgG1 levels were Non-adjuvanted RSV virosomes and FI-RSV mainly induced IgG1, indicative of a Th2-type response. Live virus inoculations induced low levels of IgG1 and similar levels of IgG2a, compared to those induced by RSV-MPLA virosomes (Figure 2B).Chapter 252 TWO******ns **ns s0123 FIGURE 2 specific IgG mice after vaccination with RSV virosomes and RSV-MPLA Mice were vaccinated twice with RSV virosomes, RSV-MPLA virosomes or controls (HNE, live virus and FI-RSV).

Statistical differences in IgE levels were calculated with an ANOVA with Bonferroni correction for multiple testing *** p<0.001. The data shown are a representative of two individual experiments To further characterize the humoral immune response, we determined IgE levels in sera and IgA levels in BAL of immunized mice. IgE was exclusively induced by immunization with FI-RSV, but not by immunization with virosomes or live virus (Figure 2C). IgA in BAL was detectable in mice immunized with FI-RSV (4.6\u00b10.1 2Log GMT) and not in mice immunized with virosomes. For assessment of the functional capacity of the antibodies, we performed a microneutralization assay. Non-adjuvanted RSV virosomes Incorporation of MPLA in to the virosomes significantly increased the neutralizing antibody titers to levels similar to those induced by live virus (Figure 2D).Evaluation of RSV-MPLA virosomes53 TWOFigure 3 to MP LA 3 | Influence of MPLA to virosome protein ratios on RSV specific IgG titers.

The data shown are a representative of two individual experiments. To investigate which concentration of MPLA is needed for optimal adjuvant activity, we added different amounts of MPLA to the viral protein in solution before reconstitution. Apart from the 1:1 protein:MPLA ratio, we also produced virosomes with 1:0.2, 1:0.04 and 1:0.008 protein to MPLA ratios. Using a similar immunization regimen and antigen dose as before, mice were vaccinated , and RSV-specific serum IgG and subtype responses were determined. The reduction in total RSV-specific serum IgG induced by the vaccine was proportional to the decline in the amount of MPLA in the virosomes (Figure 3A). The IgG2a/IgG1 subtype ratio remained similar when the amount of MPLA was reduced from 1 to 0.2 mg/mg protein but decreased when the amount of MPLA was reduced further (Figure 3B). This decrease was primarily due to a reduction in RSV-specific IgG2a levels, while the level of RSV-specific IgG1 did not increase significantly with lower amounts of virosome-Chapter 254 TWOincorporated MPLA (Figure 3C, 3D). Because there was no significant difference between the IgG subtypes induced by 1:1 and 1:0.2 protein to MPLA ratio virosomes and there are other benefits to be expected from higher MPLA concentrations (i.e. cellular immune response and reduction in lung pathology) we chose to perform the next experiments with 1:1 protein:MPLA virosomes. Cellular immunity To analyze if virosome-incorporated MPLA skews the immune response to a favorable Th1 the hallmark Th1 cytokine IL5 were determined mice, ex vivo stimulated with RSV. Supernatants of splenocytes cultures from mice immunized with RSV-MPLA virosomes or infected with live virus produced significantly increased levels of IFN compared to those from mice immunized with RSV or FI-RSV (Figure 4A) from non-vaccinated mice produced considerable levels of IFN, which may be explained by activation of innate immunity (i.e. NK cell activation) as a result of a high viral load occurring in infected na\u00efve animals. Levels of IL5 were significantly increased in splenocyte cultures from mice immunized with FI-RSV when compared to those from all other groups (Figure 4B). Next, secretion of these cytokines was measured locally, i.e. in lung homogenates, 4 days after viral challenge. In line with the above data, mice immunized with RSV-MPLA virosomes showed significantly increased IFN levels in their lungs upon live virus challenge when compared to levels measured in the lungs of mice immunized with non-adjuvanted virosomes, FI-RSV or live virus immunization (Figure 4C). Also, IL5 levels were significantly increased in the lungs of FI-RSV immunized mice when compared to the levels measured in the lungs of mice immunized with (adjuvanted) RSV virosomes or live virus (Figure 4D). Virus clearance after challenge To analyze vaccination-induced virus clearance after challenge, mice were immunized twice with HNE buffer, FI-RSV, live virus, RSV virosomes or RSV-MPLA virosomes. Two weeks after the second vaccination mice were challenged with 10 6 TCID50 live RSV. Four days later, viral titers were determined in the lungs of the animals. In the HNE vaccinated group, virus was recovered from the lungs of all mice (Figure 5). In three out of the six mice immunized with RSV virosomes, virus could not be detected. In the other mice, virus was detected albeit at a significant lower level than in non-immunized mice. In contrast, in all mice immunized with RSV-MPLA virosomes, FI-RSV and live virus, virus could not be detected. Evaluation of RSV-MPLA virosomes55 | IFN and IL5 concentrations in RSV-stimulated splenocyte cultures and lung tissue homogenates. Mice were vaccinated twice with RSV virosomes, RSV-MPLA virosomes and control vaccines as in Figure 2, and subsequently challenged with live RSV. Four days after challenge, IFN and IL5 responses were determined. (A) IFN concentrations in splenocyte cultures restimulated with BPL-inactivated RSV for three days.

Statistical differences were calculated using a Mann-Whitney-U test. * p<0.05, ** p<0.01, *** p<0.001. The data shown are a representative of two individual experiments. Lung pathology To further investigate ERD in the immunized mice, we examined lung pathology upon challenge infection (Figure 6). Mice immunized with FI-RSV showed signs of alveolitis and infiltrates in both the peribronchial and perivascular areas (Figure 6A). The lungs of mice immunized with live virus on the other hand showed no signs of pathology (Figure 6B). Mice immunized with RSV virosomes showed no signs of alveolitis but did have perivascular infiltrates (Figure 6C) In contrast, the lungs of the mice who received RSV-MPLA virosomes showed no signs of lung pathology (Figure 6D) and were very similar to the lungs of mice who received live virus or those of non-immunized mice (Figure 6B,E). In addition to this, Chapter 256 TWOwe assessed the presence of eosinophils in broncho-alveolar lavages (BAL) four days after challenge by May-Grunwald Giemsa staining of cytospotted cells. No eosinophils were detected in BAL of mice vaccinated with RSV or RSV-MPLA virosomes. On the other hand, in the mice vaccinated with FI-RSV, eosinophils were clearly present (Figure 6F). FIGURE 5 | Protection against live virus challenge and infiltration of eosinophils.

Various vaccine candidates have been evaluated in clinical trials but so far none of them showed the required safety and efficacy profiles. Generally, live attenuated virus vaccines administered intranasally are safe and well tolerated but it is difficult to obtain an optimal balance between immunogenicity and attenuation [32]. Inactivated virus vaccines appear to be hard to advance to the clinic because of the safety concerns related to the outcome of the 1960's FI-RSV trial. Protein subunit vaccines are easy to produce but are generally not very immunogenic and possibly skew towards a Th2 immune response [32]. In this study, we evaluated the immunogenicity and protective capacity of a virosomal RSV vaccine adjuvanted with MPLA. Incorporation of the TLR4 ligand MPLA into the virosomal membrane resulted in effective human TLR4 stimulation in HEK-Blue cells in vitro and activation of mouse DC ex vivo as shown by the upregulation of co-stimulatory molecules. Incorporation of MPLA in virosomes resulted production of RSV-specific, Th1-signature, IgG2a-isotype antibodies similar to that induced by live virus inoculation leading to a balanced IgG1/IgG2a profile. These antibodies proved effective in virus neutralization. Furthermore, RSV-MPLA virosomes skewed the cellular responses towards a Th1 profile, as shown by enhanced IFN secretion, not only in ex vivo RSV-stimulated splenocytes, but also locally in the lungs of infected mice. Immunization with RSV-MPLA virosomes did not induce any detectable IgE in contrast to immunization with FI-RSV. IgE induction is a hallmark of a Th2-skewed allergy-like response, which is implicated in RSV infections and in FI-RSV induced enhanced disease [33-35]. MPLA-adjuvanted virosomes, similar to FI-RSV, provided full protection against live RSV infection, but in contrast to FI-RSV, did not lead to signs of ERD, i.e. influx of eosinophils in the lungs or induction of lung pathology. Importantly, previous studies in cotton rats showed that addition of MPLA to FI-RSV reduces the induction of ERD by FI-RSV immunization, illustrated by a reduction in lung pathology, an increase in serum virus neutralization titers and a shift from a Th2 -skewed immune response to a balanced immune response [29,30]. Our observations on the immune response induced by MPLA-adjuvanted RSV virosomes in mice are in line with these data and underline that MPLA-adjuvanted RSV virosomes hold promise as a candidate RSV vaccine. Currently, RSV-MPLA virosomes are being evaluated in cotton rats to optimally assess other ERD parameters, such as alveolitis, in more detail. Our data show that non-adjuvanted RSV virosomes stimulate human TLR4 in HEK-Blue cells and upregulate co-stimulatory molecules in mouse DC and that incorporated MPLA further enhances these effects. TLR4 activation by RSV virosomes without MPLA is likely to be caused by the RSV F protein. RSV F is a known TLR4 agonist that, for example, induces inflammatory cytokines like IL-6 in DC [36]. Interestingly, despite this capacity to stimulate TLR4, RSV virosomes fail to induce Th1-type responses virosomes59 TWOeffectively stimulates Th1-type responses. This could be due to differences in the magnitude of stimulation, which is clearly higher for MPLA (Figure 1), but could also be caused by recruitment of different adaptor molecules downstream of TLR4 activation. As TLR4 uses both MyD88 and TRIF adaptor molecules, it is possible that MPLA competes with RSV F for TLR4 activation. This competition shifts signaling F-induced, MyD88-dependent, TLR4 signaling to MPLA-induced, TRIF-dependent, TLR4 a Th1-skewed immune by RSV-MPLA virosomes compared to non-adjuvanted RSV virosomes. Apart from its influence on T helper cell differentiation, TLR signaling also has a direct effect on IgG isotype switching [37]. Antibody isotype switching is important, because different immunoglobulin subclasses display differences in their ability to mediate effector responses [38]. In mice, the most effective IgG isotype protecting against viral infections is IgG2a [39]. As stated before, MPLA signals through TLR4 to induce type I IFNs which stimulate IgG2a production predominantly from follicular B cells [37]. Furthermore, MPLA could also directly activate TLR4 on B cells to facilitate isotype switching, a process that is further augmented by IFN and T-cell help [40]. virosomes. P3CSK4 inclusion also skewed towards a Th1 immune response and increased IgG2a levels compared to non-adjuvanted virosomes. P3CSK4 adjuvanted however, than IgG2a levels. Incorporation of MPLA in the virosomes induces similar IgG1 and IgG2a levels. The relative increase of IgG2a levels compared to P3CSK4-RSV virosomes could be due to increased type I IFN production induced by MPLA. Since incorporation of MPLA in virosomes increases IgG2a levels compared to or FI-RSV, antibodies induced by RSV-MPLA virosomes may well be more effective in protection against viral infection than antibodies induced by the non-adjuvanted RSV virosomes or FI-RSV. Production of virosomes does not include the application of cross-linking chemicals for inactivation of the virus. This could well be a major advantage of the use of virosomes compared to other approaches using whole inactivated virus. In this respect, it is important to note that one of the reasons why FI-RSV failed to elicit virus-neutralizing antibodies is that important epitopes on the virus are disrupted by formalin [41]. One of the most important RSV epitopes for neutralizing antibodies is a specific conformational epitope making it very susceptible for alteration by chemical treatments, including inactivation with formalin [42]. During virosome production, inactivation occurs through disruption of the membrane by the short-chain phospholipid DCPC followed by removal of the nucleocapsid. This is then followed by reconstitution of RSV F and G protein in the viral membrane with retention of their native conformation. Following this procedure, RSV virosomes lack viral RNA and thus are fully replication-incompetent [20]. Preliminary data indicate that RSV virosomes expose all of the most important known protective on the RSV F protein, as demonstrated by efficient binding of monoclonal antibodies directed to these epitopes (unpublished results).Chapter 260 TWOIn conclusion, our data show the feasibility of producing RSV virosomes that have incorporated MPLA. MPLA improves the immunogenicity of RSV virosomes and skews immune response to a protective, balanced Th1/Th2-type response without priming for adverse immune reactions, such as eosinophil influx into the lung after infection with RSV. These data combined with the favorable safety profile of MPLA, and the fact that MPLA is already licensed for use in human vaccines, make the RSV-MPLA virosomal vaccine a suitable candidate for further evaluation in clinical trials.Evaluation of RSV-MPLA virosomes61 TWO[1] Littel-van den Hurk S sic N, Kovacs-Nolan J.

Lederhofer1 T. Kamphuis1 J.C. Wilschut1 A. de Haan1 Chapter 366 THREEIntroduction In our previous study, we evaluated the immunogenicity and protective capacity of a virosomal RSV vaccine with an incorporated MPLA adjuvant derived from bacterial LPS. The data showed that virosomes with incorporated MPLA have the capacity to activate Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) [1]. As TLR4 is expressed on different immune cells, including dendritic cells (DC) and B cells [2], multiple effects of the virosome-incorporated TLR ligand on these cells are expected. For example, our data showed that virosomes with MPLA activated DCs, leading and CD40 [1]. These costimulatory molecules are essential for activation of antigen-specific T cells which, subsequently, aid in B cell activation, proliferation and antibody secretion through the activity of T cell-expressed CD40L and cytokines. Besides upregulation of costimulatory molecules on DCs, other activities of TLR ligands in the initiation of B cell activation and antibody production have been described [3]. These include direct TLR activation of B cells, inducing proliferation and isotype switching. Also, indirect effects may play a role. For example, TLR ligand-induced mouse DC cytokines, e.g. IFN, have been shown to induce isotype switching in mouse B cells, particularly towards a Th1 -signature isotype, i.e. IgG2a antibody [4,5]. To what extend MPLA in virosomes could affect isotype switching through the activities mentioned above is unknown. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the direct and indirect effects of virosomal MPLA on DC and B cell activation and isotype switching in vitro. Additionally, the study aimed to compare these activities induced by low-toxicity variants of MPLA, such as an alkaline hydrolyzed version of MPLA (3-OD-MPLA), which is present in marketed vaccines, and a fully synthetic form of MPLA, Phosphorylated Hexaacyl Disaccharide; i.e. PHAD\u00ae [6,7]. virosomes with different types of MPLA were produced and in vitro DC maturation, B cell proliferation, antibody secretion and isotype switching, induced by these virosomes, was studied. Results Direct activation of DC and B cells by RSV virosomes with incorporated M p LA variants To study direct DC activation and B cell activation by RSV virosomes carrying MPLA variants, virosomes were produced as described by Kamphuis et al. [1]. For incorporation Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL, USA), the MPLA variants were added to the protein/lipid mixture at 1 mg per mg virosomal protein and virosomes were formed by dialyzing the mixture against HNE buffer. Next, DCs were prepared as described before [1] and mouse B cells were isolated from mouse spleens through negative selection using MACS beads (Myltenyi, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany). After that, carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE) (Invitrogen, Brede, RSV-MPLA virosomes67 THREEdescribed before [8]. DCs and B cells were plated in duplicate and subsequently stimulated with RSV virosomes at 5 \u00b5g viral protein/ml or the TLR7 ligand Imiquimod (5 \u00b5g/ml) or medium as a positive or negative control, respectively. DC activation was assessed after a 24 hr stimulation period by pooling of cells, adding fluorochrome-labels antibodies specific for CD40, CD80 and CD86 and flow cytometric analysis as described before [1]. B cell proliferation was assessed after a 3-day stimulation period by analyzing CFSE dye dilution of B cells using flow cytometry and analysis by Modfit software (Verity Software House). The data in Figure 1 (A to C) show that the different variants of virosomal MPLA have a comparable capacity to upregulate CD40, CD80 and CD86 in DC, albeit generally lower in comparison with the capacity to induce upregulation of Imiquimod. Similar to responses in DC, the different variants of MPLA incorporated in virosomes induced a comparable proliferation response in B cells (Figure 1D).

Chapter 368 THREEEffects of RSV virosomes carrying M pLA variants on isotype switching and antibody production Next, the effect of virosome-incorporated MPLA on B cell isotype switching and antibody production was studied. For this, an in vitro model for B cell antibody isotype switching was adapted from Heer and coworkers [5]. In this in vitro model, B cells are activated using a CD40-specific monoclonal antibody (MoAb), which mimics T cell help to B cells through CD40L-CD40 interaction. After incubation for 10 days, measurement of antibody (isotype) levels in B cell culture supernatants is done by ELISA. In addition to the CD40 signal, B cells may also be activated with TLR ligands, such as virosomes with incorporated MPLA variants or Imiquimod, and its effect on antibody levels and class switching can be determined. Alternatively, third signals may be added, including, for example, soluble factors such as IFN, produced by DC upon their stimulation with the TLR ligands mentioned above. Thus, spleen-derived B cells were plated and activated through addition of a MoAb specific for mouse CD40 (5 \u00b5g/ml). In addition, RSV virosomes carrying 5 \u00b5g viral protein/ml. Imiquimod (1\u00b5g/ml) or medium served as a positive or negative control, respectively. In separate cultures, DC were stimulated for 24 hr with RSV virosomes carrying different forms of MPLA, added at 5 \u00b5g viral protein/ml, Imiquimod (5 \u00b5g/ml) or medium and supernatants of these cultures were added to corresponding B cell cultures stimulated with similar TLR ligands. Alternatively, recombinant IFN was added at 10 ng/ml. After incubation for 10 days, supernatants were harvested and antibody levels and isotype were determined by ELISA as described before [1]. Figure 2A shows that CD40 activation without TLR triggering results in a low level of IgG1 production without significant switching to IgG2a. Addition of virosomes carrying MPLA variants, particularly virosomes with native MPLA, promoted IgG2a switching, while also stimulating IgG1 production. Imiquimod also induced some switching to IgG2a. Addition of IFN generally stimulated IgG2a switching, particularly when B cells were activated with virosomes with native MPLA or Imiquimod, and seemed to reduce levels of IgG1 (Figure 2B). Addition of supernatants from DCs MPLA variants or Imiquimod clearly enhanced IgG2a levels, most prominently when DC cultures were stimulated with virosomes with plain MPLA or Imiquimod. In contrast to levels of IgG1 in Imiquimod-stimulated cultures, levels of IgG1 in virosomal MPLA-stimulated cultures were increased (Figure 2C). Thus, all three MPLA forms incorporated in virosomes have the capacity to induce IgG isotype class switching.In vitro immunopotentiating different MPLAs on RSV specific IgG1 and IgG2a levels of B cells in vitro. B cells, isolated from spleen, were stimulated for 10 days in different conditions: (A) with different RSV vi- cells. For (C) differentiated DCs, isolated from mice, were stimulated, ex vivo, overnight with different RSV virosomes vaccines and supernatant was added to B cells. Bars represent specific IgG1 and IgG2a production of B cells measured by ELISA. Statistical differences were calculated using the Mann-Whitney-U test (*p<0.05).Chapter 370 THREEDiscussion In this study, we evaluated the direct and indirect effects of different variants of MPLA incorporated in RSV virosomes on DCs and B cells. All three tested MPLA variants (i.e. native MPLA, 3-OD-MPLA and PHAD\u00ae, the latter representing a synthetic version of MPLA) had similar effects on DC maturation with upregulation of CD40, CD80 and CD86 and, also, on B cell proliferation. Virosome-incorporated MPLA variants also stimulated antibody secretion and isotype switching to IgG2a antibody production in splenic B cells, particularly when supernatants were added from DC cultures activated with adjuvanted virosomes. These direct and indirect effects of MPLA most likely contribute to immunopotentiation which we observed upon immunization of mice with MPLA-containing virosomes. In this respect, it is of interest to note that, in vivo, MPLA-containing virosomes induce a similar ratio of IgG1 to IgG2a antibodies, as demonstrated previously [1]. Enhanced antibody secretion and isotype switching to IgG2a was most prominently seen when RSV virosomes containing native MPLA were used but similar effects were observed for virosomes with 3-OD-MPLA or PHAD\u00ae, albeit at a somewhat lower magnitude. The observed enhanced antibody secretion and isotype switching to IgG2a in vitro is likely to be a direct effect of the adjuvanted virosomes on B cells and an indirect effect from soluble factors produced by DCs upon stimulation. The direct effect on B cells is most likely mediated by TLR4 engagement on B cells. In general, TLR4 engagement on immune cells can lead to the triggering of both TRIF and MyD88 adaptor molecules [9]. Previous studies demonstrated that TLR7 and TLR9 activation on murine B cells stimulated proliferation, antibody production and isotype switching towards IgG2a and that this activity was MyD88- dependent [5,10]. Although the TLR4 agonist MPLA is reported to induce TRIF-based signaling cascade upon TLR4 activation [11], additional signaling through MyD88 is likely and transcription factors that are induced downstream of this adaptor molecule, e.g. NFB, lead to general B cell activation and proliferation [9,12]. As indicated above, indirect effects on antibody production and isotype switching may be mediated by soluble factors produced by DCs upon their stimulation. Heer and coworkers reported that type I IFN inhibits production IgG1 isotype antibodies and enhances isotype switching to IgG2a in B cells that are activated through CD40 and TLR ligands [5]. Type I IFN, such as IFN, is produced by DCs upon TLR4 activation and thus could represent a soluble factor that aids in the indirect effect of DC supernatant on B cell antibody production and isotype switching. Indeed, we observed reduced IgG1 isotype production in IFN-supplemented cultures of B cells with anti-CD40 and virosomes with MPLA variants (Figure 2B versus Figure 2A), although enhanced IgG2a production was not evident. Antibody production and switching was most prominently seen when supernatants from DC cultures stimulated with MPLA-containing virosomes were added to B cell cultures. It is likely that these supernatants contained other B cell-supporting factors In vitro immunopotentiating activities of RSV-MPLA virosomes71 THREEsuch as BAFF and APRIL [13]. These factors are produced upon TLR activation in DCs [14]. In line with this reasoning, receptors for BAFF and APRIL, such as TACI, are upregulated on B cells upon TLR4 activation [15]. It is likely that enhanced antibody production and isotype switching in B cells results the above (direct and indirect) effects of MPLA variants in virosomes, not only in vitro as demonstrated here, but also in vivo, as shown before [1]. We conclude that all three MPLA variants used in this study activate B cells and DCs. 3-OD-MPLA and PHAD\u00ae are less toxic than natural MPLA, which makes them both attractive for use in vaccines. In addition, PHAD\u00ae is a synthetic molecule, which would be particularly preferred for use vaccines, such as the RSV virosomal vaccine used in this study. Indeed, PHAD\u00ae is a well-defined molecule and suitable for production of vaccines under Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP).

Wilschut1 A. de Haan1* To be submitted to MD pI Viruses Chapter 476 FOURAbstractRespiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is one of the major causes of bronchiolitis in infants and children. As RSV infection does not lead to life-long protection and multiple infections occur throughout lifetime, also elderly and immunocompromised individuals are at risk to develop severe disease upon RSV infection. To date, there is no registered vaccine to prevent RSV infection. Here we describe an approach to develop a RSV vaccine with an build-in adjuvant that could particularly be useful in people with a decreased immune reactivity and poor response to vaccines. In our approach, we used reconstituted RSV viral envelopes (virosomes) with incorporation of monophosphoryl lipid A (MPLA). Here, we specifically compared the immunopotentiating capacity of MPLA produced from biologically derived LPS with other, low of MPLA like alkaline hydrolyzed MPLA For this, RSV virosomes carrying MPLA variants were produced and their capacity to induce RSV-specific antibodies in mice was tested. Our data show that virosomes containing 3-OD-MPLA or 3D-PHAD induced significantly higher levels of RSV-specific IgG antibodies as well as RSV neutralizing antibodies compared to virosomes with MPLA. Next, we tested the effect of increasing concentrations of the low toxicity variant 3D-PHAD in virosomes on induction of (neutralizing) antibodies, antibody isotype, CD8 T-cell immunity and protection against Incorporation of 3D-PHAD in RSV virosomes boosted RSV-specific Th1-signature antibody responses, i.e. IgG2a, and also induced CD8 T cell immunity. Increasing the adjuvant levels further boosted IgG responses and CD8 T cell responses but not IgG2a antibody levels. Immunization with RSV virosomes conferred protection against infection. Taken together, these data demonstrate that a MPLA variant with low toxicity, like the synthetic MPLA variant 3D-PHAD, is an excellent replacement for MPLA and highly suitable for future use in GMP produced RSV virosomal vaccines.Evaluation of a negative-sense single-stranded RNA virus, which belongs to the family Pneumoviridae. The virus is a major pathogen for infants, causing yearly approximately 100,000 hospitalizations of young babies [1,2]. Besides this, RSV is also recognized as a serious threat for adults [3]. Many years of research have resulted in a better understanding of the pathophysiology of RSV infection [4]. Nonetheless, treatment options are limited. So far, the only treatment that is available represents prophylaxis with a monoclonal antibody, Palivizumab, which has been shown to provide effective prevention of RSV infection in specific high-risk infants [5-7]. Despite intensive research, effective RSV vaccines for susceptible infants or the elderly and immunocompromised individuals are still lacking. Promising vaccine candidates are currently being evaluated and it has become clear that different targets groups for vaccination might require different vaccine formulations [8]. The most suitable vaccine for babies and young infants may well be an attenuated virus formulation. Alternatively, young infants may be protected through vaccination of pregnant women with an inactivated virus or subunit vaccine. In this strategy, maternal antibodies, transferred to the unborn baby, protect it for the first critical months after birth. Finally, the elderly and immunocompromised individuals need vaccines that will boost pre-existing immune responses [8]. As gradual senescence of the immune system causes symptomatic disease after RSV infection among the elderly, a particle-based vaccine that carries both the F and G glycoproteins of the virus in association with a strong adjuvant might give the best protection in this target group. Such a particle-based vaccine could also serve as a suitable vaccine candidate for pregnant women. Stegmann et al. and Kamphuis et al. developed a virosomal RSV vaccine with an incorporated lipophilic adjuvant [9,10]. Virosomes are reconstituted virus envelopes that contain the membrane glycoproteins of the native virus but lack the viral nucleocapsid. Virosomes derived from influenza virus have been shown to retain the receptor-binding and membrane fusion characteristics of the virus, underlining the preservation of the native structure of the viral envelope glycoprotein hemagglutinin [11-13]. Likewise, RSV-derived virosomes are expected to retain the original structure of the viral envelope glycoproteins F and G. The latter is of crucial importance for induction of strong virus-neutralizing antibody responses [14]. The RSV virosomal vaccine has been shown to be effective in mice and cotton rats and was therefore further developed [9,10]. Recently, we described the use of monophosphoryl lipid A (MPLA) as an lipophilic adjuvant for use in RSV virosomes [9]. This adjuvant represents the lipid A backbone of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), but is 10,000 times less toxic than LPS [15]. MPLA activates immune cells through engagement of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). This not only results in boosting of neutralizing antibody responses but also, through cross-presentation of viral epitopes to CD8 T cells by dendritic cells, in activation of CD8 T cells Chapter 478 FOURthat aid in clearance of RSV from the lungs [16,17]. Besides MPLA itself, variants of MPLA with even lower levels of toxicity have been developed, such as the 3-O-deacyl MPLA (3-OD-MPLA), which is present in marketed vaccines. However, MPLA and 3-OD-MPLA are complex mixtures of molecules, with a common phosphorylated carbohydrate backbone and a variable number of acyl chains that also vary in length. The use of a single synthetic MPLA-like molecule in vaccines would be advantageous if the potency was at least similar to that of the mixture. Therefore, in the present study we compared MPLA and 3-OD-MPLA with a synthetic variant, 3D-PHAD\u00ae. To this end, we prepared RSV virosomes with the different MPLAs. Upon immunization of mice, we studied the induction of protective neutralizing antibodies and cellular immunity, i.e. RSV-specific CD8 T cells. Material and Methods Ethical statementAnimal experiments were evaluated and approved by the Committee for Animal Experimentation (DEC) of the University Medical Center Groningen, according to the guidelines provided by the Dutch Animal Protection Act (permit number DEC5662). Immunizations and challenges were conducted under isoflurane anesthesia, and every effort was made to minimize animal suffering. Virus production CCL-81 Vero cells (ATCC, Wesel, Germany) were grown on Cytodex-1 beads (GE Healthcare, Eindhoven, The Netherlands) in 500mL disposable spinner flasks (100mm top cap and 2 angled sidearms, Corning, Wiesbaden, Germany) with serum-free culture medium Optipro-SFM supplemented with Pen/Strep and L-Glutamine (Westburg, Leusden, The Netherlands). The cells were infected with RSV strain A2 (American Type Culture Collection, ATCC VR1540), with a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.001, at a nuclei count of 8x10 5 cells/ ml. The virus was harvested at 50-80% of cytopathic effect (CPE). Cytodex-1 beads and cell debris were removed by filtration through a Pall mini Profile\u00ae filter capsule with a pore diameter of 10 \u00b5m (Pall, Amsterdam, The Netherlands), residual cellular DNA was digested by treatment with benzonase (Novagus, Merck, Schwalbach am Taunus, Germany), and the supernatant was clarified through Sartopure PP2 filters with a pore size of 1.2 and 0.65 m (Sartorius, Goettingen, Germany) to remove further particle debris. The material was concentrated by tangential flow ultrafiltration on a Midikros (molecular weight cut-off 0.05 m; polysulfone (PS)) filter (Spectrum labs, Breda, The Netherlands) and the medium was exchanged with PBS buffer (137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 10 mM Na 2HPO4, 1.8 mM KH2PO4, pH 7.4) by diafiltration. The virus was purified from the concentrate by gel filtration (size exclusion) chromatography. The purified and concentrated virus was rapidly frozen with cryoprotectant (10% sucrose (w/v)) and virosomes79 FOURVirosome production RSV virosome formulation and production were adapted from Stegmann et al. (2010). Briefly, purified RSV A2 virus was concentrated by tangential flow ultrafiltration using a 30 kDa PS hollow fiber (, GE Healthcare), the cryprotectant was exchanged for HNE buffer (5 mM Hepes, 145 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.4) by diafiltration and concentrated virus was dissolved in 50 mM 1,2 dihexanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DCPC) (Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL, USA) in HNE buffer. The nucleocapsid was by rotor, at 50k rpm for 30 min, and the viral membrane supernatants were harvested. For each mg of viral protein in the supernatant, a dry lipid film was prepared from 850 nmol of a 2:1 molar mixture of phosphatidylethanolamine (transphosphatidylated from egg PC (eggPE)) and natural phosphatidylcholine from egg yolk (eggPC) and 255 nmol cholesterol (Avanti) plus various amounts of adjuvants, dissolved in prepared from MPLA by alkaline hydrolysis as described in US patent 4,912,094; briefly 5 mg of MPLA was dissolved in 2.2 ml of chloroform and 1.6 ml of methanol, and 52.5 \u00b5l of 0.5 M NaHCO 3, pH 10.5 was added to it and incubated for 30 min at 51\u00b0C, after which the reaction was stopped by neutralization with HCl, and chilling on ice. The 3-OD-MPLA was then re-extracted with chloroform and dried; the preparation was checked by thin layer chromatography and the concentration determined by phosphate assay. The lipid-adjuvant mixtures in chloroform/methanol were evaporated to a dryness in a glass tube and then 100 nmol of DCPC in HNE was added to dissolve the dried lipid film. The viral membrane supernatant containing the membrane lipids and proteins was added to the DCPC dissolved lipid-adjuvant mixture. The mixture was incubated for 15 min on ice, filtered through a 0.22 m filter (Whatman, Sigma Aldrich, Zwijndrecht, The Netherlands) and dialyzed in a gamma-irradiated slide-A-lyzer cassette (10kD cut-off; Thermo Scientific, Geel, Belgium) against 6 x 2 liters of PBS (pH 7.4) and 1 x 2 L of HNE in total for 48 hr. After dialysis, virosomes were stored at 4\u00b0C until further use. Animals and immunizations Female Balb/c mice (OlaHsd, specific pathogen free [SPF]), 6-8 weeks old were supplied by Harlan (Zeist, The Netherlands). Animals were immunized IM, under light isoflurane anesthesia, by injecting 50 \u00b5l of the vaccine in the calf muscles of both hind legs (25 \u00b5l per leg). The dose level was 5 g viral protein per immunization. Chapter 480 FOURImmunological assays IgG antibody ELISA. Assays were performed as described before (Stegmann et al. 2010; Kamphuis 2012). Briefly, 96-well plates were coated overnight with betapropiolactone (BPL)-inactivated RSV. Separate plates were coated overnight with goat anti-mouse IgG, (Southern Biotech, Uden, The Netherlands). After blocking and washing, the RSV-coated plates were incubated with two-fold serial dilutions of mouse sera. Goat-anti-mouse IgG-coated with increasing concentrations of IgG1 or IgG2a isotype antibody (Southern Biotech) and served to generate standard curves for each respective isotype. After washing, RSV-coated plates were incubated with horseradish-peroxidase-coupled goat anti-mouse IgG, (Southern Biotech) for detection of serum IgG antibody levels. For detection of levels of IgG1 or IgG2a isotype antibodies, RSV-coated plates or anti-mouse IgG1 or goat anti-mouse IgG2a (both from Southern Biotech). After washing, the plates were stained using o-Phenylenediamine (OPD; Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA) and read in a ELISA plate reader at 492 nm. IgG titers was determined as the reciprocal of the highest dilution with an optical density (OD) reading of at least 0.2, after subtraction of the OD of the blank. For assessment of IgG1 and IgG2a antibody levels, blank OD values were first subtracted from serum OD readings. Determination of IgG1 and IgG2a concentrations were done by plotting concentrations from the IgG1 or IgG2a standard curves, using an Excel macro (plotted at OD 0.2 for low isotype concentration sera or OD 0.5 for high isotype Cellular immunity; CD8 T cell responses. ELISpot assays were done using interferon gamma (IFN-) kit (eBiosciences, Amsterdam, The Netherlands). ELISpot plates (Nunc, silent screen plates) were processed according to the ELISpot kit manufacturer's instructions. Wells were filled with 4x10 5 spleen cells/well and stimulated with medium, KYKNAVTEL peptide (Biosynthesis; 5 g/ml) for 24 hr. Plates were then processed further according to the manufacturer's instructions. Spots were counted automatically using an Aelvis ELISpot counter. Spot counts were averaged and spot counts induced by medium stimulation were subtracted from the spot counts induced by peptide stimulation. Virus titration and microneutralization assay. Virus titers in the lungs were determined by titration of the median tissue culture infectious dose (TCID 50) in homogenated lungs from infected mice as described earlier before (Kamphuis 2012). The titers of virus neutralizing antibodies in serum were determined by a microneutralization assay, also as described before (Kamphuis 2012). Statistical analysis All statistical analyses were performed with Graphad Prism 5.00 (GraphPad Software, San Diego California USA, www.graphpad.com. Statistical significance was assessed using the Mann-Whitney U test. A P value of 0.05 or lower was considered to represent a statistically significant difference.Evaluation of RSV-3D-PHAD\u00ae virosomes81 FOURResults Immunogenicity of RSV virosomes comprising variants of M pLA First, we investigated the immunopotentiating activity of RSV virosomes comprising different forms of MPLA adjuvant: (i) untreated MPLA produced from bacterial LPS (referred to as MPLA), (ii) an alkaline-hydrolyzed version of the latter (3-OD-MPLA), and (iii) the fully synthetic 3D-PHAD\u00ae (see Figure 1). We examined levels of RSV-specific IgG (Figure 2A and C) and virus-neutralizing (VN) antibodies (Figure 2C) in serum of mice after primary and booster immunization with RSV virosomes with a two-week interval. The adjuvant concentration was 200 nmol per mg virosomal protein. Mice inoculated with HNE buffer or RSV virosomes without adjuvant served as controls. FIGURE 1 | Structural formula of the synthetic 3D-PHAD\u00ae. The molecule comprises of a phosphorylated and penta-acylated carbohydrate backbone (source illustration: https://avantilipids.com/product/699852; Accessed November 22, 2017). Figure 2A clearly shows that the MPLA adjuvant is needed to induce an efficient primary RSV-specific antibody response in mice, since there was no detectable antibody in mice immunized with virosomes without adjuvant. This difference became less prominent after the booster immunization (Figure 2B). Nonetheless, mice immunized with virosomes containing 3D-PHAD\u00ae or 3-OD-MPLA developed significantly higher RSV-specific IgG antibody responses than mice immunized with plain virosomes. Importantly, virosomes containing 3D-PHAD\u00ae or significantly higher IgG titers than virosomes containing MPLA. In line with the above, virosomes containing 3D-PHAD\u00ae or 3-OD-MPLA induced significantly higher levels VN antibody levels compared to virosomes without adjuvant (Figure 2C). Again, virosomes containing either 3D-PHAD\u00ae or 3-OD-MPLA induced significantly higher levels of neutralizing antibody titers in mice 2 weeks after primary (panel A) or booster (panel B) and virus neutralizing titers after booster (panel C) immunization with RSV virosomes comprising different variants of MPLA. Mice were vaccinated twice IM with different RSV virosomes formulated with 3D-PHAD\u00ae, 3-OD-MPLA or MPLA. Control groups were either mice vaccinated with HNE or virosomes without adjuvant. Each injection contained 5\u00b5g of protein. (A) RSV-specific IgG titers in serum two after primary vaccination. (B) RSV-specific IgG titers in serum two weeks after booster vaccination. (C) RSV neutralization antibody titers in serum obtained 5 days after challenge. Bars represent the GMT (log10) (Panel A and B) and mean neutralization titers (log2) (Panel C) of 5 mice per group. Statistical differences were calculated using the Mann-Whitney U test (*p<0.05, **p<0.01). These results underline that the alkaline-hydrolyzed 3-OD-MPLA and synthetic 3D-PHAD\u00ae are more potent adjuvants in the context of RSV virosomes than untreated MPLA. On the other hand, there was little mutual difference in adjuvanticity between 3-OD-MPLA and 3D-PHAD\u00ae. In view of these observations, we decided to further focus on the use of 3D-PHAD\u00ae, because this variant, compared to 3-OD-MPLA, has the distinct advantage of being fully synthetic. Thus, we next investigated the concentration dependence of the immunopotentiating properties of 3D-PHAD\u00ae incorporated in RSV virosomes. Virosomes were produced with 300 or 600 nmol 3D-PHAD\u00ae per mg of viral protein. Mice were immunized with these virosomes, as described above, and the induction of RSV-specific serum IgG was analyzed. Again, virosomes without adjuvant served as control. As in the experiment of Figure 2, there was a significant difference between virosomes containing 3D-PHAD\u00ae and virosomes without 3D-PHAD\u00ae in 600 nmol 3D-PHAD\u00ae of virosomal protein induced significantly IgG titers than virosomes containing 300 nmol 3D-PHAD\u00ae per mg of virosomal protein (Figure 3), thus, boosting antibody responses by 3D-PHAD\u00ae is concentration dependent. control 0 300 60002468GMT IgG titers 2 weeks after primary (panel A) or booster (panel B) immunization of mice with RSV virosomes containing different concentrations of 3D-PHAD.

Effect of increased on RSV- specific IgG subtype levels In the 1960s, a clinical vaccine trial among infants using formalin-inactivated RSV became a failure in that the vaccine did not protect but rather induced enhanced disease after subsequent exposure of the vaccinees to native RSV virus [18-21]. This later appeared to be due to induction of non-neutralizing antibodies and a Th2-dominated T helper cell response. Therefore, it is clear that, in the context of an inactivated RSV vaccine, induction of a Th2 response is undesirable. Since it is known that MPLA adjuvants induce skewing of the T helper response towards Th1 [9], we now investigated whether 3D-PHAD\u00ae-containing virosomes also induce such a Th1-skewing of the response. To this end, RSV-specific IgG subclass levels were measured 3D-PHAD\u00ae-containing RSV virosomes. Adjuvanted virosomes induced significantly higher of compared to levels induced by non-adjuvanted virosomes (Figure 4A). An increase in adjuvant level did not have an effect on RSV-specific IgG1 levels. Adjuvanted virosomes, IgG2a antibodies (Figure 4B). Again, increasing the adjuvant level did not result in increased RSV-specific IgG2a levels. Adjuvantation with 3D-PHAD\u00ae clearly skewed responses towards Th1-signature antibody responses, as evidenced by a shift in IgG1/IgG2a ratio's (Figure 4C). CFIGURE and IgG2a (panel B) subclass levels and IgG1/2a ratio (Panel C) 2 weeks after primary and booster immunization of mice with RSV virosomes containing different concentrations of 3D-PHAD.

Statistical differences were calculated using Mann-Whitney U test (**p<0.01). Thus, incorporation of 3D-PHAD\u00ae in RSV virosomes boosts RSV-specific IgG and Th1- signature antibody responses. Increasing the adjuvant levels further boosts IgG responses but does not further shift IgG1/IgG2a ratio's. Cellular immunity induced by 3D- ph AD\u00ae-containing RSV virosomes It has been reported that MPLA has the capacity to induce cross-presentation of class I MHC- restricted epitopes to CD8 T cells by dendritic cells. We therefore investigated if 3D-PHAD\u00ae-adjuvanted RSV virosomes could induce RSV-F specific CD8 T cells. To this end, we employed a class I MHC-restricted RSV-F peptide to detect IFN- producing RSV-F-specific CD8 T in the spleen of immunized animals using ELISpot. Virosomes IFN- producing CD8 T cells (Figure 5). An increase in adjuvant level significantly increased the level of these cells (Figure 5). Thus, 3D-PHAD\u00ae in virosomes has the capacity to induce cross-presentation of the associated antigen, leading to activation of RSV-specific CD8 T cells stimulated with class I MHC-restricted peptide derived from RSV F glycoprotein. Mice were vaccinated as described in figure 4. Fourteen days after booster vaccination, spleens were harvested, cells isolated, plated and stimulated for 24 hr with the KYKNAVTEL peptide. ELISpots were counted, averaged and expressed as Spots/1x10 6 cells. Statistical differences were calculated using Mann-Whitney U test (*p<0.05, **p<0.01). protection of mice against virus challenge after immunization with 3D- ph AD\u00ae-containing RSV virosomes To study if the immunity conferred by the RSV virosomes leads to protection against a challenge with RSV virus, immunized mice and non-immunized mice as controls were infected i.n. with 10 6 TCID50 live RSV. Four days later, viral titers were determined in their lungs. Infectious virus could be recovered from all non-immunized mice (Figure 6). Immunized mice, however, did not show infectious virus in their lungs. This shows that, in the mouse model, immunization with RSV virosomes with or without adjuvant induces sufficient levels of RSV-specific antibody to provide protection against live virus challenge. control 0 300 600Lung immunized with RSV virosomes containing different concentrations of 3D-PHAD\u00ae (panel A) five days after challenge with live RSV. Mice were vaccinated as described in figure 4 and challenged with live virus 14 days after the booster vaccination. Four days after challenge, lungs of 5 animals per group were removed and the viral titer was determined and expressed as TCID50.Chapter 486 FOURDiscussion In this study, we analyzed the immunogenicity of RSV virosomes containing a synthetic variant of MPLA, in comparison with the activity of the native form of MPLA. We specifically focused on the induction of protective antibody responses and cross-presentation of antigen for activation of CD8 T cell-responses. Penta-acylated variants of MPLA, like 3D-PHAD\u00ae, have been reported to be less potent in the induction of inflammatory cytokines from human TLR4-positive cells when compared to hexa-acylated species present in MPLA derived from bacterial LPS [22,23]. Yet, our data show that 3D-PHAD\u00ae was superior to MPLA in potentiating RSV-specific IgG and neutralizing antibodies. It should be noted that in MPLA, hexa-acylated variants represent only a fraction of the MPLA, while in 3D-PHAD\u00ae, all molecules are penta-acylated. In addition, the immunostimulatory capacity of MPLA is not restricted to the induction of inflammatory cytokines. Also other activities are important in the capacity of MPLA to stimulate antibody responses and isotype switching of IgG antibodies. We previously found in in vitro studies that 3D-PHAD\u00ae induces co-stimulatory molecules on dendritic cells, induces DC-derived factors involved in IgG isotype switching. It also binds directly to B cells, inducing their proliferation as well as IgG isotype switching (unpublished results). Additionally, the fact that MPLA is associated with a virosomal particle could greatly enhance its immunostimulatory activity on B cells. In support of this notion, virosome-associated lipid A, the more toxic form of MPLA, has been shown to be much more potent to induce B cell proliferation when compared to free lipid A [24]. In this respect, we previously observed that MPLA is firmly associated with RSV virosomal membranes [9]. Further studies on incorporation of MPLA in virosomes and effects of virosome size and stability are currently ongoing. To conclude, it is likely that an interplay of the above mentioned activities of virosomal MPLA efficiently boosts the antibody response in vivo, thus making virosome-associated penta-acylated variants of MPLA potent adjuvants. In this respect, the synthetic 3D-PHAD\u00ae would be particularly preferred for future use in RSV virosomes as it is a well-defined molecule, suitable for production of vaccine under Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP). We found that RSV virosomes with an incorporated TLR4 ligand, i.e. CD8 this RSV-F-derived peptide is class I MHC-restricted, the data indicate that the RSV virosomal antigens, e.g. RSV-F, must have gained access to the MHC-class I route of antigen presentation. This is mediated most likely through the process of cross-presentation of virosomal antigen by antigen-presenting cells (APCs), like dendritic cells. It has been reported that direct activation of APCs by particles that carry TLR ligands is important to induce CD8 T cell responses through cross-presentation [25,26]. MPLA particularly stimulates the capacity of DCs to conduct cross-presentation of antigens, thereby enabling these cells to load antigenic epitopes onto MHC class I molecules in early endosomal compartments [27]. We previously found that RSV Evaluation of RSV-3D-PHAD\u00ae virosomes87 FOURvirosomes with incorporated MPLA induced expression of molecules, i.e. CD40, CD80 and CD86, on and 3D-PHAD\u00ae in RSV virosomes were found to have the same activity (unpublished results). The fact that the TLR ligand is incorporated in the virosomal membrane ensures activation of only those DCs that take up the virosomes which, most likely, leads to cross-presentation of RSV virosomal antigens to CD8 T cells. In conclusion, less toxic variants of MPLA, like 3-OD-MPLA and the synthetic 3D-PHAD\u00ae in RSV virosomes have the capacity to boost protective antibody responses upon immunization in mice. Additionally, cellular immunity with induction of RSV-specific CD8 T cells is induced. We conclude that the synthetic version of MPLA, 3D-PHAD\u00ae, is an excellent replacement for MPLA produced from biologically-derived LPS as it has a good immuno-stimulatory capacities, is more safe and is thus preferred for future use in GMP produced RSV virosomal vaccines.

Wilschut1 T. Stegmann2* Chapter 592 FIVEAbstractPurpose Characterization of virosomes, in late stage preclinical development as vaccines for Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV), with a membrane-incorporated synthetic monophosphoryl lipid A, 3D-PHAD\u00ae adjuvant. Methods Virosomes were initially formed by contacting a lipid film containing 3D-PHAD\u00ae with viral membranes solubilized with the short chain phospholipid DCPC, followed by dialysis, later by adding solubilized 3D-PHAD to viral membranes, or to preformed virosomes from DMSO. Results Virosomes formed from lipid films contained the membrane glycoproteins G and F, at similar F to G ratios but lower concentrations than in virus, and the added lipids, but only a fraction of the 3D-PHAD\u00ae. By single particle tracking (SPT), the virosome size distribution resembled that seen by cryo-electron microscopy, but dynamic light scattering showed much larger particles. These differences were caused by small virosome aggregates. Measured by SPT, virosomes were stable for 300 days. 3D-PHAD\u00ae incorporation in virosomes could be enhanced by providing the adjuvant from DCPC solubilized stock, but also by adding DMSO dissolved adjuvant to pre-formed virosomes. Virosomes with 0.1 mg/mg of 3D-PHAD\u00ae/viral protein from DMSO induced antibody titers similar to those by virosomes containing 3D-PHAD\u00ae. RSV G protein Attachment RSV Respiratory Syncytial Virus SARI Severe Acute Respiratory Infection SPT Single Particle Tracking TLC Thin Layer Chromatography a major cause of viral bronchiolitis among infants and young children, and also causes serious disease in immunocompromised individuals and the elderly. Worldwide, approximately 120 million people are affected by a severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) each year, among whom 1 million patients do not survive the infection [1,2]. It has been shown that RSV is one of the most common pathogens to cause SARI [3]. Despite the impact of RSV on global health, there is no vaccine available for prevention of RSV infection. This is in part due to the disastrous outcome of an early clinical study among young children in the 1960s. In this trial, a formalin-inactivated RSV vaccine (FI-RSV) induced enhanced respiratory disease in vaccinees upon natural infection, leading to increased morbidity and the death of two children [4-7]. This unexpected response was found to be due in part to the induction by the FI-RSV vaccine of low-affinity and poorly neutralizing antibodies directed to the fusion (F) glycoprotein of RSV. [8-13] While RSV vaccine development has been delayed, an effective RSV vaccine remains urgently needed. At the same time, there is an increasing awareness that different vaccine formulations may be required for different target groups for vaccination. Live-attenuated vaccines, which mimic exposure to wild-type RSV, aim at protection of infants and young children, while avoiding enhanced respiratory disease. Alternatively, young infants in the first critical months after birth may be protected through vaccination of the mothers during the third trimester of pregnancy [14]. In this case, the main aim of vaccination is a short-term induction of high titers of virus-neutralizing (VN) antibodies for efficient transfer through the placenta. An inactivated vaccine comprising at least the RSV F glycoprotein may well be optimally suited for this purpose. Finally, an RSV vaccine is also needed for the elderly and immunocompromised individuals. Here, it is a gradual senescence or dysfunction of the immune system that may cause symptomatic disease after RSV infection, despite repeated exposure to the virus earlier on in life. Clearly, here the aim of vaccination is to boost the pre-existing immune response. A particle-based formulation comprising both the F and G glycoproteins of the virus and containing a powerful adjuvant, would appear to be optimal. [8,15-18] We are developing a virosomal vaccine targeting the elderly and pregnant women. Virosomes are reconstituted viral envelopes that contain the membrane glycoproteins of the virus but lack the viral nucleocapsid. Properly produced virosomes retain the receptor-binding and membrane fusion characteristics of the virus from which they are derived, as has been shown extensively for influenza virosomes, [19-21], indicating that the native structure of the membrane proteins was preserved. For RSV, this could be crucial, since with the early FI-RSV vaccine, discussed above, critical epitopes of the viral F glycoprotein were disrupted, which led to induction of low-affinity antibodies with a deficient capacity to neutralize the virus [22,23]. It has been shown that potently neutralizing antibodies directed against the F glycoprotein bind to the native conformation of the [24-26]. The Virosome formulation, composition, and long-term stability95 FIVEsecond envelope protein, the attachment (G) protein, is the receptor binding protein of the virus [27]. Combinations of F and G protein in RSV vaccines have been shown to be substantially more immunogenic than F or G alone [4,28]. In initial RSV virosome vaccine candidates, we tested a lipophilic adjuvant, monophosphoryl lipid A (MPLA) (Kamphuis et al., 2012) and a derivative, 3-desacyl MPLA, incorporated in the virosomal membrane [29]. 3-desacyl MPLA is used as an adjuvant in several marketed human vaccines. 3-desacyl MPLA is 10.000x less toxic than bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), from which it is derived. Nonetheless, it remains a potent activator of the immune system [30]. MPLA is known to activate the immune system through engagement of Toll-like-receptor 4 (TLR4) [31]. This activation skews the immune response towards a Th1 T-cell response, leading to increased antibody levels of the favorable IgG1 subtype [32]. Kamphuis et al. have shown that incorporation of MPLA in RSV virosomes results in increased virus-neutralizing antibody responses in mice and cotton rats compared to non-adjuvanted virosomes [33]. The experiments of Kamphuis et al. also demonstrated protection of mice and cotton rats against viral challenge after immunization with MPLA-containing virosomes [34]. Thus, MPLA is a potentially suitable RSV virosome vaccines. However, MPLA and 3-desacyl MPLA are complex mixtures of about 20 molecules, differing in the number and length of acyl chains, for example, complicating vaccine production. The present study describes biochemical and physical characterization of a virosomal RSV candidate vaccine containing the synthetic adjuvant 3D-PHAD\u00ae, identical to one of the most active molecules present in 3-desacyl MPLA. The study provides size distribution analysis by various techniques, including single-particle tracking (SPT), dynamic light scattering (DLS) and cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM), as stability studies by SPT, as well as a quantitative account of the lipid, adjuvant and protein composition of the virosomes, methods for incorporating the adjuvant, and initial comparative immunogenicity studies. Chapter 596 FIVEMaterials and Methods Virus and cell culture CCL-81 Vero cells (ATCC, Wesel, Germany) were grown on Cytodex-1 beads (GE Healthcare, Eindhoven, The Netherlands) in 500mL disposable spinner flasks (100mm top cap and 2 angled sidearms, Corning, Wiesbaden, Germany) with serum-free culture medium Optipro-SFM supplemented with Pen/Strep and L-Glutamine (Westburg, Leusden, The Netherlands). The cells were infected with RSV strain A2 (American Type Culture Collection, ATCC VR1540), with a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.001, at a nucleus count of 8x10 5 cells/ml. The virus was harvested at 50-80% of cytopathic effect (CPE). Cytodex-1 beads and cell debris were removed by filtration through a Pall mini Profile filter\u00ae capsule with a pore diameter of 10 \u00b5m (Pall, Amsterdam, The Netherlands), residual cellular DNA was digested by treatment with benzonase (Novagus, Merck, Schwalbach am Taunus, Germany), and the supernatant was clarified through a filter train combining Sartopure PP2 filters with a pore size of 1.2 and 0.65 m (Sartorius, Goettingen, Germany) to remove further particle debris. The material was concentrated by tangential flow ultrafiltration using a Midikros 145cm 2, pore size 0.05 m, polysulfone (PS) UF/DF filter (Spectrum labs, Breda, The Netherlands) and the medium was exchanged for PBS buffer (137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 10 mM Na 2HPO4, 1.8 mM KH2PO4, pH 7.4) by diafiltration. The virus was purified from the concentrate by gel filtration (size exclusion) chromatography. The purified and concentrated virus was rapidly frozen with cryoprotectant (10% sucrose (w/v)) and stored at -80\u00b0C until further use. Virosome production RSV virosome formulation and production were adapted from Stegmann et al. (2010). Briefly, purified RSV A2 virus was concentrated by tangential flow ultrafiltration using a 26 cm 2, molecular weight cut-off (MWCO) 30 kDa PS ultrafiltration hollow-fiber filter (GE Healthcare), the cryprotectant was exchanged for HNE buffer (5 mM Hepes, 145 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.4) by diafiltration, and concentrated virus was dissolved in 100 mM 1,2 dihexanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DCPC) (Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL, USA) in HNE buffer. The nucleocapsid was removed by ultracentrifugation in a table-top ultracentrifuge, S100 AT4 rotor, at 50k rpm for 30 min, and the viral supernatant was collected. In a first set of experiments, a mixture of 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylethanolamine (DOPE), 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine (DOPC) and cholesterol (3D-PHAD\u00ae) [35] (Avanti), in a 2:1 chloroform/methanol solution was evaporated to form a dry lipid film in a glass tube. The film was dissolved in the viral supernatant to attain final concentrations of 850 nmol DOPE, 425 nmol DOPC, 255 nmol cholesterol, and 300 nmol 3D-PHAD\u00ae per mg of total viral protein in the supernatant. Virosome formulation, composition, and long-term stability97 FIVEAlternatively, stock solutions of lipids were prepared in 200 mM DCPC in HNE and a stock solution of 3D-PHAD\u00ae (1mg/ml) was prepared in 500 mM DCPC in HNE, and these were mixed with the viral supernatant, as further indicated in the Results section. The supernatant/lipid mixtures were incubated for 15 min on ice, filtered through an 0.22 m cellulose acetate filter (Whatman, Sigma Aldrich, Zwijndrecht, The Netherlands) and dialyzed in a gamma-irradiated slide-A-lyzer cassette (10kD cut-off; Thermo Scientific, Geel, Belgium) against 6 x 2 liters of PBS (pH 7.4) and 1 x 2 L of HNE in total for 48 hr. After dialysis, virosomes were stored at 4\u00b0C until further use. Sucrose density gradient analysis The virosomes were analyzed by equilibrium sucrose density gradient centrifugation on a 10-60% (w/v linear sucrose gradient in HNE buffer as described earlier [36]. Gradients were centrifuged in a Hitachi centrifuge for 60 hr in an AH650 rotor at 50k rpm (296,005 g). Fractions of 0.5 ml were collected from the gradient and analyzed for protein using a Bio-Rad Bradford protein assay (BioRad, Veenendaal, The Netherlands) [37], phospholipid as described and density by refractometry. Biochemical analysis of RSV virosomes Thin Layer Chromatography: The virosomes were analyzed for the presence of incorporated lipids and adjuvant by TLC. TLC plates were activated at 150\u00b0C for 30 min before use. Virosome samples (non-extracted), and control samples (dissolved in chloroform/methanol, 2:1) were applied onto the TLC plates with a Hamilton syringe. Control samples were DOPE, DOPC and synthetic 3D-PHAD\u00ae, 1 to 1.5 nmol each. The plates were dried and then eluted with chloroform/methanol/water (100:75:15 by vol), and subsequently dried and incubated, under gentle shaking, for 30 sec in 15 ml cerium molybdate stain (Hanessian stain: ammonium molybdate, cerium sulfate, and sulfuric acid), and developed for 10 min at 150 \u00b0C. TLC plates were scanned and the intensity of each spot (DOPE, DOPC and 3D-PHAD\u00ae) was semi-quantified by ImageJ. HPLC and LC-MS. To quantify the incorporated amounts of lipid and synthetic 3D-PHAD\u00ae, virosome preparations, prepared with pre-dissolved lipids and 3D-PHAD\u00ae, were analyzed by TNO Triskelion Netherlands) by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) for DOPC, DOPE and cholesterol. The HPLC system Thermo Scientific Ultimate 3000 was used for this analysis with a Waters Acquity BEH Phenyl 1.7 m, 2.1 x 100 mm column, at a column temperature of 40\u00b0C and a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Mobile phase A contained 0.1 % formic acid, 10 mM NH 4Ac, 5 % methanol and water, mobile phase B contained 0.1 % formic acid, 10 mM NH4Ac in 100 % methanol and the injection volume was 1 \u00b5l. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) was conducted by M-Scan (Geneva, Switzerland) and or by Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL, USA), using proprietary methods, to determine the amount of 3D-PHAD\u00ae, incorporated in the virosomal membrane.Chapter 598 FIVESDS-PAGE: Virosomes were on a SDS-PAGE gel (RunBlue SDS Gel 16%, Westburg, The Netherlands) followed by silver staining according to manufactures protocol (ProteoSilver Silver stain kit, Sigma-Aldrich, Zwijndrecht, The Netherlands). Mark12 (Thermofisher, Breda, The Netherlands) protein standard was taken along to determine the size of each protein. Electron microscopy Immunogold labeling: For immunogold labeling, Palivizumab a humanized monoclonal antibody against F protein (ASD Specialty Heath Care Inc., Chicago IL) and MAB858-2 (Millipore), a mouse-derived monoclonal antibody against G protein were used. FCF-300-Ni Mesh grids (Electron Microscopy Science, Hatfield, PA, USA) were first incubated, face downward, on a droplet of sample (virosomes 1:10 dilution, virus undiluted), pH 7.4 for 5 min, then blocked with blocking agent (Aurion, Wageningen, The Netherlands) for 30 min and incubated for 1 hr with Palivizumab and MAB858-2, at a dilution of 1:100 in Breda, The Netherlands) containing 5% blocking agent (Aurion). After in PBS with 5% blocking agent, grids were incubated for 1 hr with secondary antibody, 1:20 diluted in PBS/5% blocking agent, then washed in PBS/5% blocking agent and afterwards in PBS. Secondary antibodies were a 6-nm gold-coupled goat anti-human antibody for Palivizumab for MAB858-2. Grids were fixed with 1% glutaraldehyde in PBS for 10 min, followed by washing with water. Grids were stained for 30 sec with 1% uranyl acetate and air dried for EM analysis. Samples were also single -labeled to detect either F or G proteins. For this, same protocol was used as described here. Secondary antibodies were a 10-nm gold coupled goat anti-human antibody for Palivizumab and a 6-nm gold coupled goat anti-mouse antibody for MAB858-2. Sample preparation was done in duplicate. For negative controls a random IgG mouse antibody and human-anti-human actin-beta antibody (AbD Serotec, Oxford, UK) were used. Images were recorded with a Veleta camera on a JEOL JEM 1011 transmission electron microscope and analyzed with the software iTEM (Soft Imaging System, Munster, Germany). Cryogenic TEM: Cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analyses were performed at the Electron Microscopy Centre of the Wageningen University (The Netherlands). Quantifoil R2/2 holey carbon grids were exposed to a glow discharge in air for 20 sec. Four \u00b5l of the suspension was applied to each grid, which were then blotted and vitrified in liquid ethane using a Vitrobot (FEI Company). Frozen specimens were observed at -180\u00b0C in a JEOL JEM2100 transmission electron microscope (JEOL Ltd, Japan) equipped with a Gatan CT3500 cryoholder and a Gatan US4000 camera. Images were taken at 2-4 \u00b5m under focus.Virosome formulation, composition, and long-term stability99 FIVESingle-particle tracking Particle size distribution of the virosomal RSV vaccine was evaluated using a NanoSight LM10 a 60 mW 405 nm Malvern Instruments Ltd, UK) and a Hamamatsu Ocra Flash 2.8 CMOS camera (Hamamatsu Photonics KK, Hamamatsu, Japan). Before and after each sample measurement, the sample cell was cleaned and dried according to instructions of Malvern Instruments. An appropriate dilution of the samples was prepared to obtain an optimal particle concentration between 40 - 100 particles/frame. Samples were diluted in HNE buffer in two or three steps. Seven consecutive 60-sec videos were recorded for each dilution. Shutter and gain settings were optimized for each sample. The camera histogram gating was adjusted for each individual measurement to maximize sensitivity. Data analysis was performed in NanoSight NTA 3.0 or NTA 3.1 software (Malvern Instruments) in batch mode, using finite track length adjusted (FTLA) weighting. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) The particle size of the virosomes was also determined using dynamic light scattering (DLS) in a Zetasizer Nano-ZS90 (Malvern Instruments). Intensity-size distribution graphs, Z-average (mean cluster size based on the intensity of scattered light) and polydispersity index values were recorded. Each analysis typically comprised 3 consecutive measurements including the Z-average diameter. Ethical statement Animal experiments were evaluated and approved by the Committee for Animal Experimentation (DEC) of the University Medical Center Groningen, according to the guidelines provided by the Dutch Animal Protection Act (permit number DEC5662). Immunizations were conducted under isoflurane anesthesia, and every effort was made to minimize animal suffering. Animals and immunizations Female Balb/c mice (OlaHsd, specific pathogen free [SPF]), 6-8 weeks old were supplied by Harlan (Zeist, The Netherlands). Animals were immunized IM, under light isoflurane anesthesia, by injecting 50 \u00b5l of the vaccine in the calf muscles of both hind legs (25 \u00b5l per leg), at a dose of 5 g of viral protein per immunization. Anti-RSV IgG ELISAs and neutralizing antibody tests were performed as described before [33,36] Briefly, for ELISA, 96-well plates were coated overnight with betapropiolactone (BPL)-inactivated RSV. After blocking, SV-coated plates were incubated dilutions of and then incubated with horseradish-peroxidase-coupled goat anti-mouse IgG, (Southern Biotech) for detection serum IgG antibody levels, stained with o-Phenylenediamine (OPD; Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA), and read in a Chapter 5100 FIVEELISA plate reader at 492 nm. IgG titers were determined as the reciprocal of the highest dilution with an optical density (OD) reading of at least 0.2, after subtraction of the OD of the blank. The titers of virus neutralizing antibodies in were determined by incubation of serial two-fold dilutions of decomplemented serum with infectious virus, and infecting Hep-2 cells with the mixtures [33]. Results physical and biochemical analysis of the composition of RSV virosomes Virosomes were prepared from purified RSV virus, strain A2, as described in Materials and Methods. Briefly, purified RSV virus was solubilized with DCPC, the viral nucleocapsid was removed by ultracentrifugation, the supernatant was added to a dry lipid film consisting of DOPC, DOPE, cholesterol and 3D-PHAD\u00ae, the film was solubilized in the DCPC-containing supernatant and, after sterile filtration, the final mixture was dialyzed.

Phosphorylated HexaAcyl Disaccharide, a fully synthetic produced monophosphoryl lipid A (source illustration: https://avantilipids.com/product/699852; Accessed March 20, 2018). The formation of virosomes was analyzed by equilibrium sucrose density-gradient centrifugation. Figure 2 shows the results for a typical virosome preparation. Protein and phosphate were found to co-migrate in a single peak in the gradient, indicating successful reconstitution of the viral envelope. The absence of phosphate outside the virosome peak indicates that DOPC, DOPE and 3D-PHAD\u00ae (which all have phosphate groups) were essentially quantitatively associated with the virosomal membrane. Some non-incorporated protein was present in fraction 3 of the gradient.Virosome formulation, composition, and long-term stability101 FIVE1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10050010001500 1.00001.05001.10001.15001.20001.2500protein (ug/ml) phosphate (nmol/ml)density (g/ml) fraction FIGURE 2 | sucrose gradient analysis of virosomes. An RSV A2 virosome preparation was analyzed by equilibrium density gradient centrifugation on a 10-60% sucrose gradient. Fractions of 0.5 ml were taken from the bottom (left side), and the density, protein and phosphate concentration of each fraction was determined. The protein composition of the virosomes was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. In unfractionated virosome preparations, the F and G membrane proteins were found (Figure 3A), along with the viral matrix (M), and phosphoprotein (P). G, uncleaved or non-reduced F (F0), and its F1 subunit were identified by blot (not shown); the F1 subunit has an apparent molecular weight of 54 kDa, and the G-protein was around 120 kDa in size, corresponding to the sizes of F and G reported in the literature [39-41]. On the gel, the position of uncleaved F (F0) overlaps with that of G (Figure 3A). In the virosome fraction of the gradient, F, G and M were present. The non-incorporated protein consisted mainly of M and P, most likely from residual nucleocapsid (Figure 3B). Semi-quantitative analysis of M and P band intensity of fraction 3 and 8 by ImageJ revealed that 46 % of M and 40 % of P are present in virosome fraction 8. The incorporation of lipids and adjuvant into the virosomes was analyzed by thin-layer chromatography (TLC). The results of the TLC analysis confirmed that DOPC, DOPE and 3D-PHAD\u00ae were present in the virosome preparation (Figure 3C). To roughly quantify the amount of incorporated lipids and adjuvant, the intensities of the spots observed after TLC analysis of the virosomal lipids, shown in Figure 3C, were determined using ImageJ analysis. The relative recoveries of DOPE and DOPC in the virosomes were essentially equal and represented approximately half of the amounts that were initially added, indicating a somewhat lower recovery than that of the viral protein (64%). However, the total quantity of virosome-associated adjuvant 3D-PHAD\u00ae was found to be less than 10% of the amount initially added. It therefore appeared that 3D-PHAD\u00ae was specifically lost during the production process.Chapter 5102 FIVE200 116 97 66 55 36 31G/F0 MF1 P A B 200 116 97 66 55 36 31 Fr 3 Fr 7 G/F0 MF1 P C FIGURE 3 | Biochemical analysis of RSV virosomes.

Spot intensity measurements were done using ImageJ software. Immunogold labeling The presence of F and G protein in the virosomal membrane, as shown in Figure 3A, was further examined by double immunogold electron microscopy staining. With this technique, F and G were visualized simultaneously using specific monoclonal antibodies and secondary staining antibodies coupled to 6-nm gold particles for the F protein and to 15-nm particles for G protein. The double immunogold staining gives an indication for the ratio of F and G protein incorporated in the virosomal membrane compared to that in the native virus. Several experiments showed that, in different virosome samples, the amount of virosome-incorporated F protein was higher than that of G, in agreement with the F-to-G ratio in native RSV virions. Detailed examination of the electron micrographs showed that the F-to-G ratio in the virus sample shown in Figure 4B/C was 7.1:1, while that in the virosomes shown in Figure 4A was 5.3:1. Whereas the F-to-G ratio was thus similar in virus and virosomes, the overall membrane surface density of both envelope glycoproteins together appeared substantially lower in the virosomes than in the virus (Figure 4). This reduced density results from the presence of added lipids in the virosome membrane, which expands the membrane, and also from the fact that in virosomes, in contrast to virus, the membrane glycoproteins are randomly oriented, facing the inside of the virosome as well as the outside [21].Virosome formulation, composition, and long-term stability103 FIVEControl single immunogold staining was performed to exclude possible interference between the gold-conjugated monoclonal antibodies directed to F and G. The results showed that the number of gold particles bound to F or G did not vary between the single or double immunogold staining procedures (results not shown). This indicates that during double immunogold staining, the mAbs did not interfere with each other. Other controls (as described in Materials and Methods) showed that there was no cross-reactivity between the antibodies binding to F or G (results not shown). F G G F GF FFG GA B C FIGURE 4 | Double immunogold labeling of virosomes and purified RSV. Virosomes (A) and purified virus (B and C) were labeled with two different sizes of gold particles. The G protein was labeled with 10 nm gold particles and the F protein with 6 nm gold particles. Negative stain EM images, scale bars are 100 nm. Size distribution analysis of the virosomesThe size distribution of virosomes is usually determined by dynamic light scattering (DLS) [42]. By cryo-electron microscopy the virosomes appeared heterogeneous, and a large majority was smaller than 100 nm (Figure 5). However, by DLS it appeared as though the particles were much larger, with a broad size distribution, indicating a large fraction of particles with sizes between 200 and 500 nm (Figure 6D). Such particles were not seen at all by microscopy. Chapter 5104 FIVE FIGURE 5 | Cryo-electron micrograph of RSV virosomes. To understand these discrepancies and find a reliable method to accurately determine the size of the virosomes, size measurements by single-particle tracking (SPT) were tested, and some model studies were undertaken. DLS is a population-based technique, which measures the mean hydrodynamic diameter of particles in suspension based on fluctuations in the light scattering produced by the particles [43-46]. Particles are best described by the Z-average diameter, the intensity weighted harmonic mean using this technique, but that parameter may not accurately measure particle size in heterogeneous populations of particles. A Polydispersity Index (PdI) is therefore calculated from the data. The lower the PdI the more homogenous the suspension. For virosomes, a PdI of <0.4 is acceptable [42]. Single-particle tracking (SPT) measures the Brownian motion of individual particles in liquid, which is directly related to the size of the particles by the Stokes-Einstein equation [47]. For this technique, the best measure of size is the mode, the particle size that is most frequent in the population. The reliability of size measurements in samples by DLS vs. SPT was first examined using monodisperse suspensions of polystyrene beads of 100 nm and 200 nm particle diameter, as well as a mixture of beads of 100 nm and 200 nm in a ratio of 2.5:1. DLS and SPT measured similar Z-average diameters and modes, respectively, for either 100-nm (93 nm by SPT, 106 nm by DLS) (179 nm SPT, 212 nm DLS) polystyrene beads in suspension alone, showing a single peak of in the size distribution histogram (Figure 6). Compared to SPT, the size distribution as measured by DLS was much broader, from 50 to 200 nm for the 100-nm beads, and (PdI) the DLS measurements was low, 0.026 for the 100-nm and 0.021 for the 200-nm beads. with the mixture of 100- and 200-nm beads, DLS did not resolve the two populations (Figure 6C). DLS showed one broad peak for the mixture, with a mean size of 207 nm, which is biased towards the larger particle Virosome formulation, composition, and long-term stability105 FIVEsize, although the majority of the particles was 100 nm. In spite of this, the calculated PdI was low also, 0.095, for the mixture of 100-nm and 200-nm beads, which would indicate a monodisperse sample. Therefore, the DLS data do not accurately represent the size distribution of the sample, without revealing the problem by an elevated PdI. In contrast, SPT clearly showed a large peak at around 100 nm (mode 96 nm) as well as a small peak at around 200 nm. 0 100 200 300 400 50001\u00d71082\u00d71083\u00d71084\u00d7108 010203040 Size (nm)NTA concentration (particles/ml)DLS intensity (%) SPTDLS 0 200 300 400 50001\u00d71082\u00d71083\u00d7108 010203040 Size (nm)NTA concentration (particles/ml)DLS intensity (%) SPTDLS 0 200 300 400 50002\u00d71084\u00d71086\u00d7108 010203040 Size (nm)NTA concentration (particles/ml)DLS intensity (%)SPTDLS 0 300 400 50001\u00d71092\u00d71093\u00d7109 051015 Size (nm)SPT concentration (particles/ml)DLS intensity (%) SPTDLSA CB D FIGURE 6 | Polystyrene beads in monodisperse and polydisperse suspension and virosome sample measured with SPT and DLS.

Size distributions were measured by DLS (red) and SPT (black). Notice different scales. Figure 6D shows the size distribution of the virosomes measured by SPT and DLS. The SPT measurement showed a modal size of 96.3 nm. There was a clear right-hand shoulder in the size distribution, indicating a population of larger particles, or aggregates of smaller particles. The same virosome preparation measured by DLS showed a much broader peak with a Z-average of 113.1 nm and a PdI of 0.358. As for the mixture of polystyrene beads, DLS measurements of the virosomes thus showed larger mean particle diameters than SPT and a broader size distribution, which could be caused by the larger particles or aggregates revealed by SPT dominating the signal in DLS. By SPT, D10, D50 and D90 5106 FIVEthe median, is defined such that half of the particle population has a diameter smaller than this value. Likewise, 90 percent of the particles have a diameter below the D90 value, and 10 percent below the D10 value. It was concluded that SPT measurements were much more representative of the virosomes as observed by electron microscopy (Figure 5), with the exception of the right-hand shoulder; by EM, particles larger than 100 nm were not observed. It is possible that in solution, some virosomes would aggregate and move as one large particle. By EM that cannot be verified. Stability and aggregation of RSV virosomes Virosome samples were analyzed over time for their long-term stability to investigate if aggregates were accumulating. A fresh preparation of virosomes was measured immediately after production and then stored at 4\u00b0C for 300 days. Periodically, samples were taken and the size distribution was measured with SPT (Figure 7, Table 1) and cryo-TEM (Table 2). It was observed that the virosomes would sediment over time, potentially indicating aggregation of the particles. Before each SPT measurement, or electron microscopy, samples were inverted several times to resuspend the sediment, and diluted with buffer. As measured by SPT, the mode and D10 changed very little over time. However, between freshly produced virosomes and all other time points, there was a slight increase in D90, and in the number of particles in the right-hand shoulder of the distribution. An arbitrary cut-off of 150 nm was chosen to characterize these (Table 1). The size of the particles as measured by EM was consistently smaller than that measured by SPT and showed no trend over time. The difference was not due to the size limit in SPT; SPT cannot measure particles smaller than 30 nm, but by EM, such particles were not detected.

Improved incorporation of 3D- phAD\u00ae in the virosomes As indicated above, the recovery of the 3D-PHAD\u00ae adjuvant in the virosomes was significantly lower than that of the other virosomal components (Figure 2). In the initial virosome production process, the lipids were deposited as a thin lipid film on the wall of a glass tube, which was then dissolved in the viral supernatant, which contained 100 mM of the short-chain phospholipid DCPC, acting as a detergent (its critical micelle concentration is about 17 mM). The 3D-PHAD\u00ae/viral protein ratio in the mixture was 1 mg/mg. The resulting mixture was clear, suggesting all components were dissolved. After sterile filtration, virosome were formed from the filtrate by dialysis.Chapter 5108 FIVEIn order to investigate the loss, and to measure 3D-PHAD\u00ae more precisely, two contract research organizations independently developed methods to measure its concentration in a virosome sample by LC-MS, reaching similar conclusions (Table 3); indeed, less than 1% of the added adjuvant was incorporated in the virosomes. Heating the glass tube with the lipid film/viral supernatant mixture to about 45\u00b0C for about 30 min, increased the virosome-incorporated amount of 3D-PHAD\u00ae tenfold. It was next attempted to dissolve 3D-PHAD\u00ae in 100 mM DCPC and add it to the viral supernatant. Although the solution appeared clear, after filtration the resulting virosomes still contained less than 10% of the initial amount of 3D-PHAD\u00ae. Subsequently, 1 mg/ml of 3D-PHAD\u00ae was dissolved in 500 mM DCPC (the limit of DCPC solubility in water), with bath sonication for 5-8 min at 56\u00b0C, and mixed with stock solutions of the lipids, also in DCPC. The mixture was added to the viral supernatant, and virosomes were prepared without filtration. At these concentrations of DCPC, it took 48 hr with seven changes of buffer, to completely dialyze out the DCPC. The 3D-PHAD\u00ae was incorporated quantitatively (Table 3). This was then repeated with sterile filtration of the mixture. Apparently, filtration led to the loss of viral protein, but all the 3D-PHAD\u00ae was incorporated in the virosomes, leading to an elevated 3D-PHAD\u00ae over protein ratio (Table 3). TABLE 3 | 3D-PHAD\u00ae incorporation in virosomes. Preparation3D-PHAD\u00ae incorporated (mg/mg of protein) Virosomes from a dry film of lipids and 3D-PHAD\u00ae, filtration 0.009 Virosomes from a dry film of lipids and 3D-PHAD\u00ae, heated, filtration 0.09 Virosomes from a dry film of 3D-PHAD\u00ae mM DCPC, filtration solubilized lipids @ 200 mM and 3D-PHAD\u00ae 500 mM, without filtration 0.995 Virosomes from solubilized lipids and 3D-PHAD\u00ae @ 500 mM, filtration 1.5 In all cases, 1 mg of 3D-PHAD\u00ae was added to 1 mg of viral protein during the production of virosomes. Although it was thus possible to incorporate 3D-PHAD\u00ae quantitatively in virosomes, the final concentrations of DCPC in the protein/lipid/adjuvant mixture were more than 250 mM, prolonging dialysis times. It was therefore attempted to incorporate 3D-PHAD\u00ae in pre-formed virosomes from a solution of 10 mg/ml of 3D-PHAD\u00ae in DMSO. Virosomes were prepared without 3D-PHAD\u00ae, a small aliquot of 3D-PHAD\u00ae in DMSO (25 \u00b5l) was slowly added to 975 \u00b5l of virosomes with constant stirring at room temperature, at a ratio of 0.1 mg of 3D-PHAD\u00ae per mg of viral protein, and incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C. The virosomes were then analyzed by sucrose density gradient centrifugation (Figure 8). As in Figure 2, a single peak of phosphate was found for the virosomes. The 3D-PHAD\u00ae was found to be quantitatively incorporated in the virosomes.

Fractions of 0.5 ml were taken from the bottom (left side), and the density, protein and phosphate concentration of each fraction were determined. Immunogenicity in mice of RSV virosomes with improved levels of 3D- phAD\u00ae To evaluate the immunogenicity of RSV virosomes with improved incorporation of 3D-PHAD\u00ae and to compare virosomes prepared by the DMSO method and the DCPC method, an immunization experiment in mice was performed. Mice were immunized twice, on day 1 and day 15 with virosomes, prepared by the DMSO method at 5 \u00b5g of protein per injection. In the comparator group, mice were immunized with virosomes containing 0.2 mg 3D-PHAD\u00ae per mg of protein, with 3D-PHAD\u00ae dissolved in DCPC, as described above, reasoning that the 3D-PHAD\u00ae added from DMSO would only be present in the outer leaflet of the virosomal bilayer, and that only 3D-PHAD\u00ae presented to the immune system on the outside of virosomes would act as an adjuvant. Blood samples were taken at day 28 and analyzed for neutralizing antibodies (Figure 9) and anti-RSV IgG (Figure 10) as described before [33]. Both preparations were found to induce similar antibody titers, indicating the quality of the virosomal vaccines produced by either method is equivalent.

Discussion In earlier studies, an MPLA-containing virosomal RSV vaccine was tested in mice and cotton rats, and found to induce a good immune response with a favorable safety profile [33,34,36]. Those virosomes were made by dissolving the viral membrane in DCPC, removing the nucleocapsid, adding the dissolved membranes to a dry lipid film of lipids containing MPLA, followed by sterile filtration and then dialysis of the DCPC. However, MPLA is a complex mixture of molecules which is difficult to produce and to reproduce. Aiming to produce virosomes under GMP, in the current paper, a synthetic variant of MPLA, 3D-PHAD\u00ae, was incorporated in the virosomal membrane and the virosomes were analyzed extensively. As expected, the viral membrane proteins F and G were found in the virosomes, in a ratio similar to that of the virus, albeit at a lower surface density than on virions. The lower surface density resulted from the expanded membrane, as lipids were added during virosome formation to the solubilized viral membrane components, and because of the random orientation of the membrane proteins in the virosomal membrane as opposed to the virus, where they face outward only. The lipid addition serves mainly to accommodate the adjuvant in the virosomal membrane. If the virosomes are not further purified, the preparation additionally contains at least the viral proteins P and M. About half the M protein was found to be virosome-associated after sucrose density gradient purification; the rest of the M and P were not virosome-associated. Most likely, associated M is bound to the C-terminus of F, as M drives the budding of virus by associating with F [48]. While virosomes, which were made using a mixed dry lipid film of DOPE, DOPC and 3D-PHAD\u00ae, contained approximately 50% of the added lipids, and all 3D-PHAD\u00ae was found in the peak of the gradient (not shown), only a fraction of the 3D-PHAD\u00ae appeared to be virosome-incorporated. These virosomes were then further characterized by size distribution measurements. Although the standard method for virosome size measurements is DLS, DLS showed much larger virosomes than could be seen by cryo-electron microscopy. When virosomes were measured by SPT, the size distribution partially overlapped with diameters determined from cryo-electron micrographs, except for two features; EM showed more particles with Virosome formulation, composition, and long-term stability111 FIVEa diameter between 30-50 nm, while SPT showed relatively more particles of 100-125 nm, and the size distribution by SPT had a right-hand tail, showing a fraction of particles with sizes between 150-200 nm (Figure 7B). These data suggest that small particles might aggregate in solution, with small aggregate movements jointly producing a single track in SPT measurements. Model studies were then undertaken with polystyrene beads. These studies showed that a 2.5:1 mixture of 100- to 200-nm beads is resolved by SPT (Figure 6C), but produces essentially a single, broad size distribution around the size of the larger particles if measured by DLS, just as the distribution found for the virosomes by DLS (Figure 6D). Therefore, we conclude that small aggregates, whose presence is suggested by the SPT measurement, are causing the scattering giving rise to the distribution measured by DLS. As an indication for the underlying polydispersity of a sample, DLS instruments calculate a PdI. A PdI of < 0.7 is usually taken to mean that polydispersity is low, and the size distribution measurement reliable [49]. However, both virosomes and the latex beads mixture have a polydispersity index lower than 0.7. We noticed that virosomes would sediment after weeks to months of storage in the refrigerator, suggesting they may have a tendency to agglutinate or aggregate. Irreversible aggregation would not be acceptable within the context of production under the regulations of Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) [50,51]. Also, particle size can have a substantial influence on the immunogenicity of vaccines. Therefore, the size distribution of the virosomes was followed for a prolonged period of ten months. Virosomes had to be resuspended before each measurement. Over this period, the modal size and D10 remained unchanged, while there was an only slight increase in D90 and the number of particles > 150 nm between production and the first time-point, 8 weeks later. After that, the size distribution remained constant. We conclude that the virosomes are stable and that aggregation, if it occurs al all, is largely reversible. It is possible that upon long-term storage the particles do not even agglutinate, but simply sediment because of their higher density relative to that of the medium. Although the optimal concentration of 3D-PHAD\u00ae in virosomes is not currently known pending further animal experiments, more control over the extent of 3D-PHAD\u00ae incorporation was desired. 3D-PHAD\u00ae is less soluble than phospholipids in organic solvents, with a solubility limit of around 1 mg/ml in chloroform/methanol 2:1, suggesting it is more amphiphilic. However, since DOPC and DOPE were incorporated into virosomes from a dry lipid film also containing 3D-PHAD\u00ae, while the adjuvant was not, the solubility of 3D-PHAD\u00ae in DCPC seemed limited. A solution of 3D-PHAD\u00ae in 100 mM of DCPC appeared clear, but when added to the viral supernatant and filtered, it did not lead to more incorporation. We suspect that the filtration removed aggregates or micelles of 3D-PHAD\u00ae which were not visible to the naked eye. 3D-PHAD\u00ae in 500 mM DCPC, dissolved by heating and sonication and immediately added to the viral supernatant, was incorporated quantitatively, and this 3D-PHAD\u00ae/DCPC mixture could be filtered, either mixed with the viral supernatant (Table Chapter 5112 FIVE3) or on its own (not shown). However, this is not the most convenient production method, as the high concentrations of DCPC may damage proteins and lead to long dialysis times, and low temperatures are preferred. Finally, virosomes without adjuvant were formed first, and then 3D-PHAD\u00ae, which dissolves in DMSO at up to 10 mg/ml, was added from DMSO. As the DMSO mixes with water, 3D-PHAD\u00ae becomes insoluble and inserts into the virosomal membrane; the sugar residues most likely prevent translocation across the membrane, so that it is only present in the outer leaflet of the virosomal membrane. In accordance with this, an equivalent immune response was obtained with virosomes containing 0.2 mg/mg 3D-PHAD\u00ae/protein in both leaflets of the membrane, and 0.1 mg/mg after post-formation insertion from DMSO (Figure 9, 10). An added advantage of post-formation insertion of 3D-PHAD\u00ae is that the amount of adjuvant per virosome can be halved.Virosome formulation, composition, and Singleton RJ, et al.

Despite intensive research, an effective vaccine against RSV is still lacking. As viral entry is dependent on the fusion (F) glycoprotein, particularly in its metastable prefusion conformational state (preF), this protein is a major target for neutralizing antibodies. Candidate RSV vaccines, like the RSV virosomal incorporated synthetic MPLA, i.e. 3-deacyl-phosphorylated hexa-acyl disaccharide (3D-PHAD\u00ae), as described by us previously, should therefore ideally contain sufficient levels of preF in order to induce potent neutralizing antibodies. Here, we specifically compared 3D-PHAD\u00ae-containing RSV virosomal vaccines I557V) that differ in their preF stability. We analyzed the capacity of these vaccines to induce neutralizing antibodies upon immunization of mice and also tested the dependence of the potentiation of antibody induction on the levels of virosome-incorporated 3D-PHAD\u00ae. Our data show that L19F and L19F I557V virosomes induced significant higher levels of RSV-specific IgG antibodies as well as RSV-neutralizing antibodies compared to levels induced by RSV A2 virosomes. Remarkably, L19F and L19F I557V virosomes did not induce higher levels of preF-specific antibodies compared to levels induced by A2 virosomes. However, levels of postfusion F-specific antibodies induced by L19F virosomes were higher compared to the levels induced by A2 virosomes. Immunization with all virosomal vaccines conferred protection of the mice against infection. Importantly, we found that a reduction in levels of 3D-PHAD\u00ae incorporated in the virosomes - up to 7-fold - did not affect the virosomes' capacity to induce virus-neutralizing antibodies and RSV-specific Th1-signature antibodies, i.e. IgG2a. Taken together, these data demonstrate that virosomes derived from the thermostable RSV A2 strains L19F or L19F I557V, carrying low levels of 3D-PHAD\u00ae, represent suitable vaccine candidates for use among, for example, the elderly or pregnant women.RSV-3D-PHAD\u00ae virosomes derived from thermostable RSV119 SIXIntroduction Respiratory Syncytial virus (RSV) is one of the main causes of upper and lower respiratory tract infections (URTI and LRTI, respectively), including pneumonia and bronchiolitis, particularly among young children and the elderly [1]. RSV is a negative-sense single-stranded RNA virus that belongs to the family Pneumoviridae. Infections with RSV occur worldwide, with seasonal outbreaks primarily during the winter months in regions with a temperate climate [2]. Natural infection results in incomplete immunity, which leads to recurrent infection in childhood as well as infections among adults and the elderly [3].RSV contains two major targets for virus-neutralizing antibodies: the G and F surface envelope glycoproteins [4]. The G protein mediates binding of the virus to host cells. The protein is variable in sequence and highly glycosylated. The F protein is responsible for fusion of the viral membrane with the host cell membrane and, consequently, viral genome deposition and infection. RSV-F is conserved between virus strains: this makes the F glycoprotein attractive as a target for eliciting highly neutralizing antibodies [5]. We have used RSV G and F reconstituted in lipid membranes, virosomes, in an approach to develop effective RSV vaccines. To enhance antibody responses, we incorporated a synthetic variant of monophosphoryl lipid A (MPLA), i.e. 3-desacyl-phosphorylated hexa-acyl disaccharide (3D-PHAD\u00ae), in the virosomal membrane submitted for publication). MPLA and its variants, like 3D-PHAD\u00ae, are 4 The virosome-incorporated RSV F is derived from bulk-produced whole viral particles. With respect to the latter, it is important to note that RSV-F in viral particles is displayed in different conformations: the metastable prefusion and the highly stable postfusion forms [5,8]. An irreversible change from the prefusion to postfusion form of RSV-F occurs upon interaction of the protein with the host cell target membrane. However, the metastable prefusion F also readily flips to the stable postfusion F state without interaction with target membranes, this - for example - as a result of elevated temperature or formaldehyde treatment of virus [9,10]. Consequently, both the prefusion and postfusion forms of F are simultaneously present on RSV particles in varying ratios [11]. Prefusion F (preF) and F (postF) differ in display of neutralizing epitopes. McLellan and coworkers unraveled the protein structure of preF by X-ray crystallography and discovered the antigenic site \u00d8, which is present only on preF and not on postF. A subset of highly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (5C4, AM22 and D25) have been described which bind specifically to the antigenic site \u00d8 of preF. Different investigators have demonstrated that human serum contains preF-specific antibodies with a high capacity to neutralize RSV in vitro [12-14]. Notably, the antigenic site recognized by the monoclonal antibody Palivizumab, currently the only prophylactic treatment against RSV infection for high-risk infants, is displayed by both postF and preF. This means that a vaccine candidate, like RSV virosomes adjuvanted with 3D-PHAD\u00ae, study, vaccines derived from three different RSV A2 strains that differ in their preF stability. The use of such strains for RSV virosome production would ideally yield virosomes with enhanced proportions of preF in their membranes in comparison with virosomes generated from native RSV A2. One strain, the L19F, was derived from a clinically sick infant at the University of Michigan in 1967 [15]. This L19F virus displays a higher thermostability and higher levels of preF compared to RSV A2 [16]. The other strain we used is a mutated version of L19F, L19F I557V, which carries a point mutation in the F protein at position 557 which lead to a substitution of isoleucine for valine in the membrane anchor sequence [17]. As a comparison the RSV A2 strain was used: this strain was previously used for production of RSV virosomes [18,19]. Here, we were specifically interested if L19F and L19F I557V were suitable to produce virosomes. We tested the virosomes in vivo in mice and evaluated their capacity to induce preF- and postF-specific antibodies and virus-neutralizing antibodies. Finally, we determined whether the virosome-incorporated 3D-PHAD\u00ae, at different doses, would stimulate the induction of Th1-type antibodies and virus-neutralizing antibodies. Material and Methods Ethical statementAnimal experiments were evaluated and approved by the Committee for Animal Experimentation (DEC) of the University Medical Center Groningen, according to the guidelines provided by the Dutch Animal Protection Act (permit numbers DEC5662 and DEC6647). Immunizations and challenges were conducted under isoflurane anesthesia, and every effort was made to minimize suffering. Virus and Cell culture CCL-81 Vero cells (ATCC, Wesel, Germany) were grown on Cytodex-1 beads (GE Healthcare, Eindhoven, The Netherlands) in 500mL disposable spinner flasks (100mm top cap and 2 angled sidearms, Corning, Wiesbaden, Germany) with serum-free culture medium Optipro-SFM supplemented with Pen/Strep and L-Glutamine (Westburg, Leusden, The Netherlands). The cells were infected with RSV strain A2 (American Type Culture Collection, ATCC VR1540), I557V (Emory, Atlanta, US) [17], with a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.001, at a nuclei count of 8x105 cells/ml. The virus was harvested at 50-80% of cytopathic effect (CPE). Cytodex-1 beads and cell debris were removed by filtration through a mini profile filter capsule with a pore diameter of 10 \u00b5m (Pall, Amsterdam, The Netherlands), residual cellular DNA was digested by treatment with benzonase (Novagus, Merck, Schwalbach am Taunus, Germany), and the supernatant was clarified through Sartopure PP2 filters with a pore size of 1.2 virosomes derived from thermostable RSV121 SIXm (Sartorius, Goettingen, Germany) to remove further particle debris. The material was concentrated by tangential flow ultrafiltration on a Midikros (molecular weight cut off (MWCO)/pore size 0.05 m polysulfone (PS)) filter (Spectrum labs and the medium was exchanged for PBS buffer (137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 10 mM Na2HPO4, 1.8 mM KH2PO4, pH 7.4) by diafiltration. The virus was purified from the concentrate by gel filtration (size exclusion) chromatography. The purified and concentrated virus was rapidly frozen with cryoprotectant (10% sucrose (w/v)) and stored at -80\u00b0C until further use. Virosome production RSV virosome formulation and production were adapted from Stegmann et al. (2010). Briefly, purified RSV virus was concentrated by 30 kDa PS hollow fiber (GE Healthcare), the cryprotectant was exchanged for HNE buffer (5 mM Hepes, 145 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.4) by diafiltration, and concentrated virus was dissolved in 50 mM 1,2 dihexanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DCPC) (Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL, USA) in HNE buffer. The viral nucleocapsid was removed by ultracentrifugation in a table-top ultracentrifuge, S100 AT4 rotor, at 50krpm for 30 min, and the protein concentration in the supernatant was measured the Bradford method. Subsequently, per mg of protein in the supernatant, 850 nmol of a 2:1 molar mixture of 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3- phosphatidylethanolamine (DOPE), and 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine (DOPC), dissolved in 100mM DCPC, plus 255 nmol cholesterol, dissolved in ethanol, and various quantities of 3D-PHAD\u00ae dissolved in 500 mM DCPC were added. All lipids and adjuvants were from Avanti Polar lipids (Birmingham, Alabama) The mixture was incubated for 15 min on ice, filtered through a 0.22 m filter (Whatman, Sigma Aldrich, Zwijndrecht, The Netherlands) and dialyzed in a gamma-irradiated slide-A-lyzer cassette (10K MWCO; Thermo Scientific, Geel, Belgium) against 6 x 2 litres of PBS (pH 7.4) and 1 x 2 L of HNE for 48 hr in total. After dialysis, virosomes were stored at 4\u00b0C until further use. 3D-PHAD\u00ae concentrations were determined by Avanti Polar Lipids using proprietary methods based on HPLC followed by mass spectrometry. Animals and immunizations Female Balb/c mice (OlaHsd, specific pathogen-free [SPF]), 6-8 weeks old, were supplied by Harlan (Zeist, The Netherlands). The animals were injected IM with the different vaccine formulations on Day 0 (primary immunization) and Day 13 (booster immunization), into both calf muscles at 25 l per leg. Study animals were anesthetized with 3-4.5% isoflurane/O 2 for the administrations. Protein concentrations were adjusted to the appropriate antigen dose (1 or 5 \u00b5g viral protein) per 50 \u00b5l with HNE. Chapter 6122 SIXImmunological assays IgG antibody ELISA. Assays were performed as described before [18]. Briefly, 96-well plates were coated overnight with beta-propiolactone (BPL)-inactivated RSV. Separate plates were coated overnight with goat anti-mouse IgG, (Southern Biotech, Uden, The Netherlands). After coating, plates were blocked with 2.5% milk powder in coating buffer. After washing, the RSV-coated plates were incubated for 90 min with two-fold serial of serum at dilutions of 1:200. were incubated with increasing of IgG1 isotype antibody (Southern Biotech) or IgG2a isotype antibody (Southern Biotech) and served to generate standard curves for each respective isotype. After washing, RSV-coated plates were incubated for 1 hr with a 1:5000 dilution of horseradish-peroxidase-coupled goat anti-mouse IgG, (Southern Biotech) for detection of serum IgG antibody levels. For detection of levels of IgG1 or IgG2a isotype antibodies, RSV-coated plates IgG1 or IgG2a isotype standard curves) were incubated for 1 with a 1:5000 dilution of horseradish-peroxidase-coupled goat anti-mouse IgG1, (Southern Biotech) or goat anti-mouse IgG2a (Southern Biotech). After washing, the plates were stained with o-phenylenediamine (OPD; Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA). After 30 min the staining was stopped by addition of 2 M H 2SO4 per well. The absorbances were read in a ELISA plate reader at 492 nm. The serum IgG titer was determined as the reciprocal of the highest dilution with an optical density (OD) reading of at least 0.2, after subtraction of the OD of the blank. For assessment of IgG1 and IgG2a antibody levels, blank OD values were first subtracted from serum OD readings. Determination of IgG1 and IgG2a concentrations were done by plotting concentrations from the IgG1 or IgG2a standard curves, using an excel macro (plotted at OD 0.2 for low isotype concentration sera or OD 0.5 for high isotype concentration sera). PreF- and postF-specific ELISA. Plates were coated overnight at 4 \u00b0C with either stabilized preF (DsCav-1 , Barney Grahams lab, NIH/VRC, Bethesda, US) or Grahams lab) in 1x PBS. Stabilized PreF (DS-Cav1) and postF plasmids were kindly donated by Dr. Barney Grahams lab (NIH/NIAID, VRC, Bethesda, MD, US). Briefly, DS-Cav1 or PostF were expressed by transient transfection in HEK293T (ATCC) cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Geel, Belgium). The culture supernatants were harvested 5 days post transfection and centrifuged at 1,800 g to remove cell debris. The culture supernatants were sterile-filtered through a 0.22\u00b5m Whatman filter and RSV F glycoproteins were His-tag purified with a HisTrap HP Ni column (GE Healthcare) on a \u00c4kta avant machine (GE healthcare). Relevant fractions containing the RSV F were pooled, protein was determined and protein size was checked by SDS-Gel. After coating, plates were blocked with 2% BSA Fraction V (Roche, Almere, The Netherlands) in 1x PBS. After washing, coated plates were incubated for 1 hour with two-fold serial dilutions of serum starting at dilutions of 1:20. After washing, protein F-coated plates were incubated for 1 hr with a detection of serum IgG antibody levels specific for preF or postF. After washing, the plates were stained with o-Phenylenediamine (OPD; Sigma-Aldrich). After 30 min the staining was stopped by addition of 2 M H 2SO4 per well. The absorbances were read in a ELISA plate reader at 492 nm. Virus titration and microneutralization assay Virus titration. Virus titers in the lungs were determined by titration of the median tissue culture infectious dose (TCID 50) as described earlier by [18]. Lung homogenates were centrifuged at 1400 rpm for 10 min at 4\u00b0C, and supernatants, diluted to a 1:5 starting dilution, were used to determine viral titers using the TCID 50 method. For this, serial twofold dilutions of the samples were made in 96-well plates in quadruplicate using HEp-2 medium without FBS. Then, 20,000 HEp2 cells were added to the virus dilutions and plates were incubated for five days at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2. The cells were washed with PBS and fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 45 min, blocked with 2% milk powder (Protifar plus, Nutricia, Zoetermeer, The Netherlands) in PBS for 1 hr and stained with 50 l 1:400 fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)- labeled goat anti-RSV antibody per well (Meridian Life Science Inc, Saco, ME, USA) at 37\u00b0C overnight. The next day, plates were washed with PBS and analyzed under a fluorescence microscope. Wells were considered positive for infection if one or more fluorescent syncytium was present. Titers were calculated using the Reed & Muench method. Microneutralization assay. The neutralization titers were determined as described below. In brief, neutralization titers were determined by incubation of twofold serially diluted decomplemented serum with TCID50 of RSV for 2 hr and subsequent titration of this mixture on HEp-2 cells as described by Kamphuis et al (2012). In brief, volumes of 100 l of serum were heat-inactivated for 30 min at 56\u00b0C and subsequently diluted with 150 l serum-free HEp2 medium. Wells of 96-well plates were filled with 50 l of serum free HEp2 medium. 50 l of diluted serum was applied to the first row of wells in quadruplicate and serial twofold dilutions were made. Subsequently, 70 TCID50 of RSV-A2 was added in 50 l of serum free HEp2 medium and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 2 hr. After incubation, 20,000 HEp2 cells were added per well in 100 l of HEp2 medium with 4% FBS. After five days of incubation, wells were washed with PBS and then fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 45 min, blocked with 2% milk powder (Protifar plus) in PBS for 1 hr and stained with 50 l 1:400 FITC-labeled goat anti-RSV antibody (Meridian Life Science Inc) at 37\u00b0C overnight. The next day, plates were washed with PBS and analyzed under a fluorescence microscope. Wells were considered positive for infection if one or more fluorescent syncytium was present. Neutralization titer was calculated with the Reed & Muench method and is indicated as the reciprocal of the dilution that neutralizes infection in 50% of the wells.Chapter 6124 SIXStatistical analysis All statistical analyses were performed with Graphad Prism 5.00 (GraphPad Software, San Diego California USA, www.graphpad.com. Statistical significance was assessed using the Mann-Whitney U test. A P value of 0.05 or lower was considered to represent a statistically significant difference. Results Antibody responses upon immunization with A2, L19F and L19F I557V virosomes We first evaluated the capacity of virosomal preparations derived from the stabilized RSV strains to induce RSV-specific IgG antibodies and subtypes in vivo. To this end, virosomes were produced from the two mutant RSV strains and native RSV A2 virus, with incorporation of equal quantities of the adjuvant 3D-PHAD\u00ae. To analyze the capacity of the different virosomes to induce RSV-specific IgG and subtypes, mice were immunized IM twice as described before [19]. Serum samples from immunized mice were collected after boost vaccination and analyzed for their IgG titers and isotypes. In this study, a group of mice injected IM with buffer served as a negative control while a group injected IM with inactivated whole RSV A2 virus served as a positive control. 3D-PHAD\u00ae-adjuvanted virosomes induced significantly higher levels of RSV-specific IgG compared to inactivated whole RSV virus (Figure 1). Also, virosomes induced significantly higher levels of RSV-specific IgG2a antibodies compared to the levels induced by inactivated RSV virus (Figure 2A-C), a hallmark of - TLR4 ligand-induced - Th1-skewed immune responses [19]. Notably, the thermostable strains L19F and L19F I557V induced significantly higher levels of RSV-specific IgG antibodies, composed of increased levels of both IgG1 and IgG2a, when compared to levels induced by virosomes derived from native RSV A2 (Figure of mice RSV virosomes from thermostable and native RSV A2.

Statistical differences were calculated using Mann-Whitney test (*p<0.05, ***p<0.001). Virus-neutralizing antibodies and protection against viral infection in vivo To allow the analysis of the induction of neutralizing antibodies in more detail, sera after the primary and secondary immunization were analyzed for levels of virus-neutralizing (VN) antibodies. After a single immunization, groups immunized with L19F and I557V virosomes demonstrated significantly higher levels of VN antibodies compared to the levels observed in the group that received RSV A2 virosomes (Figure 3A), which remained low or undetectable. A booster immunization with RSV A2 virosomes did stimulate the levels of VN antibodies, but not to the levels that were reached by a booster immunization with L19F or L19 I557V virosomes (Figure 3B). Inactivated A2 induced VN antibodies. The average levels of VN antibodies in groups immunized with L19F or L19 I557V virosomes were at least 4-fold higher compared to the average levels observed in Chapter 6126 SIXthe group immunized with A2 virosomes, both in sera after the prime immunization and after the booster immunization (Figure 3). Thus, while carrying similar levels of 3D-PHAD\u00ae adjuvant, virosomes derived from the thermostable L19F and L19F I557V strains are superior in inducing neutralizing antibodies when compared to virosomes derived | Virus-neutralizing titers after primary or booster immunization of mice with RSV virosomes derived from thermostable and native RSV A2. Mice were immunized as described in the legend to Figure 1.

Horizontal bars represent mean neutralization titers (log2) of 10 mice per group. Statistical differences were calculated with Mann-Whitney test (**p<0.01, ***p<0.001). Vaccine-induced protection To investigate protection against infection in vivo, mice from each group were challenged IN with live RSV virus two weeks after the second immunization. In the control group, virus was recovered from the lungs of all non-immune animals that received buffer only (Figure 4). In three out of five mice immunized with inactivated RSV A2 virus, virus was detected in the lungs (Figure 4). By contrast, from none of the mice immunized with virosomes, virus could be recovered from the lungs (Figure 4). Therefore, immunization with 3D-PHAD\u00ae-adjuvanted virosomes confers protection against infection, irrespective of the virus strain the virosomes were derived from. IgG antibodies directed against prefusion and postfusion forms of RSV-F To investigate whether the superior levels of VN antibodies seen after immunization of mice with L19F or L19F I557V virosomes (Figure 4), were attributable to higher levels of antibodies towards the prefusion conformational state of RSV-F (preF), we specifically analyzed sera from the immunized animals for the presence of antibodies against preF, using a stabilized version of preF as a coating antigen in the ELISA. In a similar set-up, antibodies specific for the post-fusion conformational state of 4 | Lung viral titers after challenge of immunized mice with live RSV. Mice were immunized as described in the legend to Figure 1, and challenged with live RSV A2 14 days after the booster vaccination. Four days after the challenge, lungs of 5 animals per group were removed and the viral titer was determined and expressed as TCID 50. Horizontal bars represent mean lung viral titers. Antibodies specific for the preF conformation were detected in sera from mice immunized with the virosomal vaccine, irrespective of the strain it was derived from (Figure 5A), Surprisingly, levels of antibody specific for the postF conformation were higher in mice immunized with the virosomes derived from the thermostable strains when compared to levels in mice immunized with virosomes derived from A2: this reached statistical significance for the L19F virosomes (Figure 5B). As expected, also inactivated A2 whole virus induced postF-specific antibodies, but not preF-specific antibodies (Figure 5). Thus, similar levels of preF-specific antibodies are induced by the different virosomes, while higher levels of postF-specific are induced after immunization with virosomes derived from for RSV preF or postF in sera of immunized mice. Mice were immunized as described in the legend to Figure 1. Serum IgG titers were determined, in duplicate, by ELISA using RSV preF (panel A) or postF (panel B) protein as coating antigens. Titers are shown for five individual animals per group, 2 weeks after the booster immunization. Black dotted lines indicate the baseline for the ELISA. Horizontal bars represent the mean of the log10 titer values. Statistical analysis was performed using Mann-Whitney SIXAntibody induction in concentrations of virosomes-incorporated 3D- ph AD\u00ae In a final experiment, we determined the dependency of L19F-I557V virosomes on incorporated 3D-PHAD\u00ae adjuvant for induction of RSV-specific antibodies with the aim to determine the minimal level of 3D-PHAD\u00ae at which it still exerts it immune-potentiating effect. The latter is important as lower levels would be beneficial in terms of vaccine safety. For this, we incorporated decreasing levels of 3D-PHAD\u00ae in L19F I557V virosomes and evaluated their immunogenicity upon IM injection in mice. Notably, for these experiments, a low level of 1 \u00b5g virosomal protein was used, this to allow detection of possible adjuvant effect conferred by the low levels of 3D-PHAD\u00ae incorporated in the virosomes. Incorporation of 3D-PHAD\u00ae at levels as low as 18 \u00b5g/mg virosomal protein already significantly stimulated IgG antibody levels and neutralizing antibodies when compared to levels induced by virosomes without 3D-PHAD\u00ae (Figure 6). Also, incorporation of 3D-PHAD\u00ae at low levels clearly skewed IgG responses towards Th1-type IgG2a antibodies (Figure 6D). In contrast, immunization with virosomes without 3D-PHAD\u00ae did not induce IgG2a antibodies (Figure 6C). Increasing levels of 3D-PHAD\u00ae in L19F antibodies and neutralizing antibodies (Figure 6A and Notably, a low level of 66 \u00b5g 3D-PHAD\u00ae/mg virosomal protein injected at a dose of 1\u00b5g viral protein induced similar levels of VN antibodies as a high level of 460 \u00b5g 3D-PHAD\u00ae/mg virosomal protein injected at a dose of 5 \u00b5g viral protein (compare Figure 6 and Figure 3). Thus, low levels of 3D-PHAD\u00ae in virosomes already result in induction of ** \u00b5g/ml*** * \u00b5g **** \u00b5g 3D-PHAD\u00ae/mg virosomal 3D-PHAD\u00ae/mg virosomal protein***EA C FIGURE mice by RSV L19F I557V virosomes containing different concentrations of 3D-PHAD\u00ae . with a 2-week interval, L19F I557V virosomes, containing different concentrations of built-in 3D-PHAD\u00ae, at a dose of 1 \u00b5g of protein per injection.

All virosomal preparations had a membrane-incorporated TLR4 ligand, 3D-PHAD\u00ae, in order to boost antibody levels and induce protective and safe Th1-skewed immune responses with induction of mainly IgG2a-type antibodies [19] (manuscript submitted for publication). While the virosomes contained similar concentrations of adjuvant and RSV antigen, the L19F and L19F A2 leading to at least 4-fold higher levels of virus-neutralizing antibodies in the sera of immunized mice. Virosome production involves solubilization of RSV viral envelopes and reconstitution of membrane antigens, such as the RSV F and G glycoproteins, in newly formed lipid membranes, virosomal membranes [18]. RSV F in its prefusion conformational state has the capacity to facilitate membrane fusion of viral and host membranes, leading to viral genome deposition in the host cell [21]. RSV preF is a metastable protein which has been shown to readily undergo a conformational change to a stable postF conformation, even without interaction with (host cell) lipid membranes. The latter evidently has consequences for the conformation of F in the process of virosome production. Factors which have been shown to contribute to F flipping from a preF to a postF conformational state include elevated temperatures [9], incubation in buffers with a low ionic strength deletion of anchoring and trimerization domains [5,23]. Recently, two RSV A2-derived strains were described that display significantly increased thermostability and levels of preF expression when compared to the parent virus strain, i.e. RSV A2. Unfortunately, we were not able to quantitate the levels of preF (or postF) on the virosomes, but our data did not indicate that virosomes derived from the thermostable virus strains have a higher capacity to induce preF-specific antibodies. Reasons for this remain at present unknown. A possible explanation could be that levels of preF decrease upon virus solubilization, i.e. the first step in virosome production, due to a transient loss of membrane anchoring of the protein. Nonetheless, it seems clear that preF is at least partly preserved, as the immunized mice produced antibodies directed against a stabilized version of the preF protein used in the ELISA (Figure 6). A competitive ELISA using site \u00d8-specific monoclonal antibodies, for example, could reveal if truly preF-specific antibodies are raised by L19F and L19F I557V virosomes, this as a proof of conservation of virosomal preF upon in vivo injection of virosomes. PreF-specific antibodies have been shown to correlate with improved RSV-neutralizing capacity of serum. Ngwuta et al. showed that absorption of antibodies from human serum with preF protein removes over 90% of the neutralizing capacity of the serum. These investigators and others found that, besides antibodies to sites exclusively displayed on RSV-3D-PHAD\u00ae virosomes derived from thermostable RSV131 SIXpreF, also antibodies directed against antigenic sites I, II, and IV, which are displayed on both preF and postF, contribute to neutralization [5,14]. These antibodies neutralize, but usually at increased concentrations when compared to antibodies directed against site \u00d8 [5]. The above results demonstrate the complexity of neutralizing activity of (polyclonal) sera, which involves many factors like epitope accessibility, antibody concentration, affinity and specificity. In this respect, the higher levels of neutralizing antibodies induced by L19F and L19F I557V virosomes compared to those induced by native RSV A2 virosomes are likely to be attributable to both antibodies directed against preF-exclusive epitopes, like site \u00d8, as well as antibodies directed against epitopes that are shared between to preF and postF, including sites I, II, and IV. In line with the latter, L19F virosomes also induced higher levels of postF-specific antibodies compared to the levels induced by RSV A2 virosomes (Figure 6). How exactly virosomes derived from more thermostable strains, and thus presumably containing higher levels of preF, induce increased levels of postF-specific antibodies remains unknown. The RSV-G glycoprotein, which is also present in the virosomal membranes, may have contributed to the induction of VN antibodies as well [24]. It should be noted, however, that neutralization assays using infection of Hep2 cells, as used in our study, are suggested to be far more sensitive to RSV-F-specific antibodies than to antibodies directed against the RSV-G protein [14]. This suggests that RSV-F-specific antibodies RSV A2, L19F or L19F I557V virosomes are most likely responsible for the in vitro neutralization of RSV. We showed that low levels of the lipophilic adjuvant 3D-PHAD\u00ae in virosomes potentiated immune responses following injection in mice. The lowest level used in this study was at least 15-fold lower compared to that used in our previous studies [19] (manuscript submitted for publication). The lowest level of adjuvant that boosted (VN) antibody responses with induction of IgG2a-type antibodies was 18 \u00b5g 3D-PHAD\u00ae per mg vaccine antigen while a low level of 66 \u00b5g 3D-PHAD\u00ae per mg virosomal protein was as efficient as a high level of 460 \u00b5g 3D-PHAD\u00ae per mg virosomal protein in inducing VN antibodies (see Results). The levels indicated above are considerably lower compared to the levels of MPLA in, for example, commercially available vaccines such as Cervarix\u00ae or Fendrix\u00ae which contain 1250 \u00b5g synthetic MPLA per mg vaccine antigen and 2500 \u00b5g synthetic MPLA per mg vaccine antigen, respectively [25,26]. The need for a low level of MPLA in the RSV virosomal vaccine could possibly be due to the tight association of the adjuvant with the virosomal membranes that also carry the vaccine antigens: this would target the adjuvant to antigen-specific B cells through specific binding of virosomal antigen to their membrane immunoglobulins and internalization of antigens together with the adjuvant resulting in efficient B cell stimulation. The use of lower, yet equally or more effective, levels of adjuvant in vaccines is important as low levels of adjuvant would be beneficial in terms of vaccine safety.Chapter 6132 SIXIn conclusion, our data show that virosomes derived from RSV strains with enhanced thermostability, like L19F and L19F I557V, have an increased capacity to induce RSV- neutralizing antibodies. This capacity is dependent on the incorporation of an adjuvant, i.e. the TLR4 ligand 3D-PHAD\u00ae. These data warrant further exploration of virosomal RSV vaccines carrying stabilized variants of the F glycoprotein and a built-in adjuvant as a candidate vaccine for risk groups, like the elderly.RSV-3D-PHAD\u00ae virosomes derived from Respiratory syncytial virus can infect basal cells and alter human airway epithelial differentiation. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0102368.

Lederhofer1 T. Ruckwardt2 Syncytial Virus (RSV) causes considerable morbidity and mortality in infants and the elderly each year. Natural virus infection does not lead to life-long protection and thus a vaccine is urgently needed. Here we describe an approach to develop an RSV vaccine with the synthetic built-in TLR4 adjuvant MPLA (3D-PHAD\u00ae). In our approach, we used liposomes with or without associated 3D-PHAD\u00ae displaying the recombinant stabilized F via the proteins' His-tag to nickel ions chelated to the head groups of DGS-NTA lipid incorporated in the liposomal membrane. Cryo- and negative stain electron microscopy confirmed high-density arrayed trimers on the proteoliposomes. Dot blots that both preF and postF contained their full epitope display after proteoliposomal Upon vaccination, coupled preF or resulted in higher preF- and postF-specific antibody compared to 3D-PHAD\u00ae-liposomes mixed non-conjugated preF or postF. Mice immunized twice or without 3D-PHAD\u00ae, and postF 3D-PHAD proteoliposomes showed protective levels of virus-neutralizing (VN) antibodies in their serum. In some mice, however, VN titers were not high enough to protect mice after virus challenge. In addition to humoral immunity, also cellular immunity with RSV-specific IL-2, IFN- or TNF- producing CD8 T cells was induced after immunization with 3D-PHAD\u00ae-proteoliposomes (preF or postF). Taken together, RSV-F-3D-PHAD\u00ae-proteoliposomes represent a promising RSV vaccine candidate for the elderly. Evaluation of preF- and postF-3D-PHAD\u00ae-proteoliposomes139 SEVENIntroduction Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is one of the major causes of viral bronchiolitis in infants and children. Annually, approximately 33 million lower respiratory infections are recorded in children under the age of five [1,2]. RSV infection does not lead to life-long protection and multiple reinfections occur throughout individuals' lifetime. Indeed, by the age of five, most children have been infected at least two or three times with the virus. RSV is also increasingly recognized as a major cause of disease among seniors and immunocompromised individuals. In the elderly, it is the gradual senescence or dysfunction of the immune system that may cause symptomatic disease after RSV infection, despite repeated exposure to the virus earlier in life. RSV is one of the most important remaining vaccine targets, both for young children and the elderly. Unfortunately, to date, there is no registered vaccine. RSV belongs to the Orthopneumovirus genus of the Pneumoviridae family, which consists of enveloped viruses with a negative-sense, single-stranded RNA genome [3]. RSV is a pleomorphic virus with particles of about 100-200 nm in diameter. The virus envelope contains three main proteins that are exposed on the surface of the virion; the small hydrophobic protein SH, and the most abundant G and F glycoproteins. The G protein is known to be the receptor binding protein of the virus and targets the ciliated cells of the airways [4]. It is heavily glycosylated and about 90 kDa in size. The F protein of RSV is required for the attachment and fusion of the virus with the host cell. RSV-F is a type I integral membrane trimer protein and is 574 amino acids long. The functional F protein, in the virion membrane, is in a metastable prefusion (preF) form. Upon triggering, by an as yet unknown impulse, preF refolds in an intermediate state and inserts into its target cell membrane. Subsequently fusion of the viral and host-cell membranes initiates further refolding of the F protein to a stable, conformation i.e. postfusion (postF), unable to bind to or fuse with its target cell. [4] Decades of research have made it evident that RSV F and G are the major viral protective antigens and thus important targets in the vaccine development. Both the F and G envelope proteins are known to generate virus-neutralizing (VN) antibodies [5]. The G protein has a high degree of genetic variability between different RSV strains. [6] It is therefore considered to be a less attractive vaccine antigen. In contrast, the F protein of the virus is considered as an attractive antigenic target for neutralizing antibodies, because of its conserved structure and essential role in infection [7]. Recent studies demonstrated that several epitopes on the F protein are available for the induction of potent VN antibodies [7,8]. Neutralizing antibodies towards the preF form of the F protein do not prevent attachment of the virus but prevent the viral fusion process and, consequently, deposition of the viral genome in the cytosol [9]. The monoclonal antibody Palivizumab, currently used for preventive treatment of high-risk groups [10,11], binds to antigenic site II, a shared epitope between preF and postF. eptiopes, antigenic site III, IV and I [12]. Antigenic site II and IV are shared between preF and postF. Additionally, it is believed that virus neutralizing antibodies towards antigenic site III bind tighter to preF than postF [12]. Antibodies can neutralize the virus directed against site III, IV, II, with antigenic site I being the least potent antibody neutralization site. Besides these antigenic sites, two additional epitopes, i.e. antigenic site \u00d8 (zero) and antigenic site V, have been identified to be only present on preF that induce the most potent neutralizing antibodies. Accordingly, a vaccine candidate should contain preferable mostly preF. Incorporation of post F in the vaccine would be beneficial too as it also displays unique protective epitopes when compared to preF albeit that these are less potent in inducing neutralizing antibodies compared to those displayed on preF. Besides the generation of VN antibodies, induction of CD8 cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) to the conserved RSV-F antigen may be beneficial for inducing robust immunity to RSV. RSV-F specific CTLs can clear virus-infected cells and stop the spread of infection to the lower airways. Antigen presenting cells (APCs) play a key role in priming CTL responses [13]. Through the mechanism of up exogenous antigens and present on MHC class I molecules to T-cells [14]. This mechanism is mostly used by fully mature and activated dendritic cells (DCs). Proper activation of DCs, for example by TLR ligands like MPLA, and sufficient amounts of antigen that can enter MHC class I processing are important factors to trigger the downstream processes of cross-presentation [13]. An antigen carrier system, like the virosomes, that harbors both antigen and TLR ligand may therefore be an attractive approach for induction of RSV-specific CTLs. We previously developed a virosomal vaccine which consists of virus-like particles that contain all viral envelope proteins but lack the viral nucleocapsid. For influenza, it has been shown that virosomes retain the capacity for receptor binding and fusion of the virus [15]. During the virosome production process, adjuvants, like the amphiphilic molecule MPLA, a TLR4 receptor agonist (derived from LPS or synthetic), can be incorporated in the virosomal membrane. Through the incorporation of the adjuvant in the virosomal membrane and the multimeric presentation of antigens on the virosomal surface, these particles could greatly enhance their immunostimulatory activity on B cells, and thus VN antibody production. We showed previously that virosomes with synthetic or LPS-derived MPLA induce cross-presentation of viral antigens, and also have a clear promise as an RSV vaccine candidate, yet some drawbacks are associated with their production. Specifically, virosome production requires the culture of large amounts of virus and allows little control on the level of expression of preF versus postF is possible. As an alternative to virosomes we here explored the use of liposomes with conjugated recombinantly expressed RSV-F protein, i.e. proteoliposomes. These liposomes are fully synthetic; therefore, the production of whole virus is not needed. Here, we used Evaluation of preF- and postF-3D-PHAD\u00ae-proteoliposomes141 SEVENthe conformationally stabilized form of [18], well as postF of through their His-tags, are conjugated to DGS-NTA lipids that are incorporated in the liposomal membrane. This vaccine approach has several advantages with respect to virosomes; 1) no virus is needed for the vaccine production, 2) the ratio of preF and postF can be exactly predicted and 3) the particles are uniform and fully synthetic. Finally, as with virosomes, an adjuvant can be incorporated into the membrane, thus, antigen and adjuvant are delivered in one particle. In this study, we used three different liposome preparations: (1) liposomes containing DGS-NTA lipids but without adjuvant (RSV-F-proteoliposomes), (3) liposomes without DGS-NTA, thus not capable of binding RSV-F antigens, but containing the adjuvant (non-conjugated RSV-F/3D-PHAD\u00ae liposomes). The liposomes were formulated with either stabilized preF or postF. The proteoliposome preparations were analyzed for the presence of specific epitopes (antigenic-site II which is the shared postF, preF-specific antigenic-site \u00d8 and antigenic V) protein we examined the induction of preF- and postF-specific IgG antibodies, VN antibodies and CD8 T cell responses in mice after immunization. Specifically, we evaluated if delivering antigen and adjuvant in one particle, i.e. RSV-F-3D-PHAD\u00ae-proteoliposomes, is needed for in vivo induction of CD8 T cell responses, RSV-F specific IgG antibodies, VN antibodies and protection. Material and Methods Expression and purification of preF and postF protein Stabilized RSV preF and postF described elsewhere [18,19]. Briefly, preF (DS-Cav1) and postF were expressed by transient transfection in Expi293F cells using TrueFect-Max (United BioSystems, MD). The culture supernatants were harvested 5 days post-transfection and centrifuged at 10,000xg to remove cell debris. The culture supernatants were sterile-filtered and RSV F glycoproteins (including a His- and a streptavidin-tag) were purified first by nickel and then by Strep-Tactin-affinity chromatography. Relevant fractions containing the RSV F were pooled, concentrated, and subjected to size-exclusion chromatography[9]. Purified proteins are trimers, with a size Lipids were dissolved in chloroform and cholesterol was dissolved in 96% ethanol. Liposomes were composed of a molar ratio of Alabaster, AL, USA). A second and third preparation were prepared either without adjuvant or without DGS-NTA(Ni 2+), in which case the lacking components were substituted by the 2:1 DOPC:DOPE mixture. To yield a lipid film, mixed components, in various molar ratios in chloroform, were dried under argon gas. The resulting lipid film was dried further for 2 hr in a desiccator (SpeedVac). The lipids were hydrated in HBS 1M HEPES, pH 7.6) and intensively vortexed until the lipid film was visually dissolved. Five freeze/thaw cycles with liquid nitrogen and a 37\u00b0C water bath with intensive vortexing in between the steps was performed. Next, the liposomes were extruded for a minimum of 21 times, first through a 0.2 m and then through a 0.1 m membrane, using a hand-held mini extruder device (Avanti Polar Lipids) at room temperature. Concentration of dissolved lipids and final liposome particles were determined by phosphate determination as described before [21]. p rotein conjugation For conjugation, a protein to lipid ratio of 1mg/mol was used and the mixture was incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with gentle shaking. Protein was first concentrated to 4 mg/ml and subsequently incubated with the liposomes as described previously. The unbound protein was removed from the liposomes by dialysis with a Float-A-Lyzer G2 dialysis device (1000kD, Spectrum Laboratories). The proteoliposomes were collected and protein was determined with Bio-Rad Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad, Hercules, California). Lipid concentration was determined as described above and samples were stored at 4\u00b0C. Electron Microscopy All vaccine samples were sent for electron microscopy and cryo-TEM picture analysis to the Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research, Frederick, MD, US. Antigenic analysis Antigenic analysis was performed by dot blot using mAbs that either target antigenic site II on the shared surface between preF and postF (Motavizumab) or antigenic sites unique to and AM14) [18,22]. Briefly, dots of different proteoliposome preparations were applied to a nitrocellulose membrane, dried and blocked for 1 hr with 2% milk powder in PBS. Different membranes were incubated with antibodies Motavizumab, AM14 and D25 (produced and, next, incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary antibody reactive against mouse (rabbit anti-mouse IgG-HRP, Jackson Immunoresearch). Antibodies were incubated for one hour at room temperature in 2% milk powder in TBS-T (25 mM Tris, 0.15 M NaCl, 0.05% Tween-20) at a concentration of 0.2 g/mL. Antibody binding was detected with a G-box imager (Syngene) after adding ECL prime reagent (GE healthcare). preF (DS-Cav1) and postF taken along as controls.Evaluation of preF- and postF-3D-PHAD\u00ae-proteoliposomes143 SEVENImmunization experiments Adult (8 to 14-week old) female Balb/c mice were obtained from Jackson Labs (Bar Harbor, ME). Mice were housed in the animal care facility at NIAID under specific pathogen-free conditions, and maintained on standard rodent chow and water supplied ad libitum. Mice were vaccinated in week zero and week three with a dose level of 10 g total protein per dose. Serum was collected two weeks after the booster vaccination and analyzed for endpoint ELISA and neutralizing titers. Mice used in these studies were maintained according to the guidelines of the NIH \"Guide to the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals\". Experimental procedures had approval of the Animal Care and Use Committee of the Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the NIH. Mice were housed in a facility fully accredited by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International. Animal procedures were conducted in strict accordance with all relevant federal and NIH guidelines and regulations. Neutralization assay Serum after prime and boost vaccination was analyzed for neutralization capacity. For this, fourfold dilutions were prepared of serum samples two weeks after the booster vaccination starting at 1:10 through 1:40,960 with 45 l in each well. Each dilution was mixed with 45 l of diluted RSV strain A2 carrying and RSV A2 alone served as negative and positive control. The mixture was incubated for 1 hr at 37\u00b0C. Fifty microliters of the serum dilution/virus mixture was then added to HEp-2 cells that had been seeded at a concentration of 1.8 \u00d7 10 4 cells in 30 l of 10% MEM in each well of 384-well black clear-bottom plates. The plates were incubated for 22 to 26 hr at 37\u00b0C before spectrophotometric reading at 588-nm excitation and 635-nm emission (Molecular Devices LLC). Endpoint ELISA RSV-F specific IgG was analyzed in serum after boost vaccination. For this, 96-well plates were coated overnight with preF (DS-Cav1) or PostF. After coating, plates were blocked with 5% milk powder in PBS. After washing, coated plates were incubated for 60 min with four-fold serial dilutions of serum starting at dilutions of 1:10. After washing, plates were incubated for 1 hr with a 1:5000 dilution of horseradish-peroxidase-coupled goat anti-mouse IgG (200\u00b5g/0.5ml), (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for detection of serum IgG antibody levels. After washing, the plates were Microwell Peroxidase Substrate (KPL SureBlue After 5 minutes the staining was stopped by addition of 1 M H 2SO4. The absorbances were read in an ELISA plate reader at 492 nm. The serum IgG titer was determined as the reciprocal of the highest dilution with an optical density (OD) reading of at least 0.2, after subtraction of the OD of the blank.Chapter 7144 SEVENplaque assay Two weeks after booster vaccination, mice were anesthetized using isoflurane (3%), and infected intranasally with 2 \u00d7 106 PFU of live RSV in 10% EMEM in 100 l. All mice were killed by lethal overdose of pentobarbital (250 mg kg1) five days post challenge. For virus titer determination, the single left lung lobe of infected mice was collected 5 days post infection and snap-frozen in 2 ml of EMEM supplemented with 2 mm glutamine, 10 U ml1 penicillin, and 10 g ml1 streptomycin. After thawing, lung tissue was dissociated using a GentleMACS before centrifugation to remove cellular debris. Clarified neat lung supernatants were diluted and inoculated onto 80% confluent Hep-2 cell monolayers in 12-well plates. After 1 hr, plates were covered with 0.75% methylcellulose in EMEM with 10 % FBS and incubated for 5 days at 37\u00b0C. Cells were fixed with 10% formalin and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. A dissecting microscope was used to count plaques. Pfu was calculated with (# of plaques * dilution * 40)/tissue weight in grams. Flow cytometry of mouse T cells derived from lung tissue Following euthanasia, lung tissues were harvested and processed eight days post-infection as previously described [24]. After isolation, each sample was divided and half of the samples were stimulated for 5 hr with 1M of RSV-F specific CD8+ peptide (KYKNAVTEL) and the other half served as a non-stimulated control. Cell preparations were stained with fluorochrome-labeled antibodies to the following cell surface Biolegend. All staining was done for 15 min at room temperature in Brilliant buffer (BD). Prior to surface staining, cells were stained for 20 min at room temperature with ViViD for viability. BD Cytotofix/Cytoperm was used for cell fixation and permeabilization according to the manufacturer's protocol for Samples were measured on a XA50 flow cytometer and data were analyzed using FlowJo version 9.9.10 and version X. Statistical Data Analysis All statistical analyses were performed with Graphad Prism 7.00 (GraphPad Software, San Diego California USA, www.graphpad.com. Statistical significance was assessed using the Mann-Whitney U test. A P value of 0.05 or lower was considered to represent a statistically significant difference.Evaluation of preF- and postF-3D-PHAD\u00ae-proteoliposomes145 SEVENResults Synthetic liposomes as RSVSynthetic and/ or postF trimers. Initially, we calculated the maximum amount of protein that can be conjugated to a single liposome particle. For this, we assumed that 50% of the 10% DGS-NTA(Ni +) will be exposed on the external surface of the lipid membrane. On average, one liposomal particle is on average around 100 nm in diameter and the inner and outer lipid layer of the lipid bilayer contain essentially the same amount of lipids. From literature it is known that one particle, of around 100 nm, contains approximately 60,000 molecules, thus, 6,000 are DGS-NTA(Ni +), and 3,000 of these molecules will be exposed on the outside of the lipid membrane [25]. Each monomer of the stabilized preF or postF contains one His-tag, accordingly, 1000 protein trimers can be covalently bound per liposome particle. Figure 1 shows a schematic representation of proteoliposomes displaying preF or postF trimers. Biochemical determination and physical characterization of proteoliposomes with conjugated F protein We first evaluated the quantity and quality of the conjugated preF and postF protein to the proteoliposomes. The protein was conjugated to the proteoliposomes at a ratio of 1 mg of protein per 1 \u00b5mol of phospholipid and unbound protein was dialyzed. Table 1 shows a summary of phosphate and protein recovery after dialysis of each proteoliposome sample. Based on phosphate and protein recovery, after dialysis, we calculated the number of trimers that are conjugated per particle (shown in Table 1). It is remarkable that the recovery of protein in postF proteoliposomes is lower than with preF proteoliposomes, regardless of the presence of 3D-PHAD\u00ae in the liposomal membrane. The loss of lipid and protein after preparation of preF proteoliposomes was almost equal, which is an indication that entire particles with conjugated protein were lost during dialysis. In preliminary experiments, we used size exclusion chromatography (SEC) to separate unbound protein from liposome-conjugated protein. These experiments demonstrated that there was no detectable unbound protein (results not shown). Therefore, we conclude that protein conjugation to the liposomes was efficient and that essentially all added protein was bound to the liposomes. The loss of phosphate and protein, which is mentioned above (Table 1), is most likely due to loss of small particles ( <1000 kD) during dialysis. Next, we analyzed the different formulations by SDS-PAGE to detect the preF and postF protein, conjugated to the particles, following Coomassie Blue staining of the gel (Figure 2). Purified preF and postF served as controls. All samples were analyzed on the gel under reducing conditions. Under reducing conditions, the monomer of preF and postF Chapter 7146 SEVENare around in size. As expected, in all preF proteoliposome samples, one band of around 55 kDa size was observed on the SDS-gel. On the postF proteoliposome sample SDS-gel, a second band of 120 kDa size was seen, corresponding to not fully reduced preF or postF protein.

The schematic shows that liposomes incorporate lipids with DGS-NTA(Ni +) head groups that mediate coupling of PreF, PostF or a 1:1 ratio of Pre and PostF to the outer surface. The incorporated nickel in the NTA cage in the lipids head covalently binds the His tag of PreF or PostF timers.Evaluation of preF- and on liposome-conjugated preF and postF was evaluated. Monoclonal antibodies were used that either target antigenic site II on the shared epitope between preF and or antigenic site V (AM14). Figure 2 shows that all three antibodies bound to the preF proteoliposomes and the preF/postF-3D-PHAD\u00ae-proteoliposomes. Also, as expected, AM14 did not bind to postF proteoliposomes and D25 had some non-specific binding towards postfusion F [26]. This was also seen in the postF-3D-PHAD\u00ae-proteoliposomes and postF proteoliposomes samples. From the above described data, we conclude that crucial epitopes for the induction of virus-neutralizing antibodies are preserved in the proteoliposomes. FIGURE 2 | Presence of protein and its specific epitopes on conjugated liposomes. Dot blots demonstrate AM14 recognition D25 recognition of antigenic site \u00f8, and Motavizumab recognition site II PreF, PostF and Pre/PostF proteoliposomes, applied to a nitrocellulose membrane. PreF and PostF protein alone, not conjugated to liposomes, was taken along as a control. Reducing SDS-PAGE gel, stained with Coommassie Blue, of PreF, PostF and PreF/PostF proteoliposomes with or without adjuvant. Soluble purified PreF protein and PostF protein are included as controls. In the last step of the biochemical and physical characterization of the proteoliposomes, we characterized the uniformity and state of the F trimers displayed arrayed on the surface of the proteoliposomes surface by negative-stain EM and cryo-EM. Representative images of negative-stain EM and cryo-EM are shown in Figure 3. The majority of the particles were unilamellar vesicles. However, some multilamellar vesicles were also present (Figure Chapter 7148 SEVEN3B). Both preF- and postF-proteoliposomes were densely packed with trimers, as is seen in Figure 3C and D. Unbound, aggregated protein was visible in the background of the image, which is probably an artefact caused by the negative-staining procedure. Indeed, there was relatively less unbound protein to be seen in the cryo-EM images (results not shown). Further, exclusion of 3D-PHAD\u00ae from the proteoliposomes did not change their shape or size (data not shown). Figure 3: Characterization of PreF and PostF- conjugated liposomes by EM and cryo-EM.

Mice were immunized twice intramuscularly, with three-week interval, and the induction of F-specific serum IgG was analyzed. The following formulations were used in this study: (1) Liposomes with conjugated preF or post 3D-PHAD\u00ae (3D-PHAD\u00ae-proteoliposomes), (2) Liposomes conjugated with preF or post without 3D-PHAD\u00ae (proteoliposomes), (3) Liposomes incorporated ratio containing incorporated 3D-PHAD\u00ae (preF/postF-3D-PHAD\u00ae-proteoliposomes). Mice inoculated with PBS or soluble preF protein (DS-Cav1) supplemented with Alum adjuvant, served as controls. Serum was collected two weeks after booster vaccination. We specifically analyzed these sera for the presence of antibodies against preF and postF, using stabilized preF or postF protein as a coating antigen in the ELISA. 3D-PHAD\u00ae-proteoliposomes with preF induced significantly higher mean levels of antibody against preF than mean levels induced by preF proteoliposomes non-conjugated preF/3D-PHAD\u00ae liposomes (Figure 4B). Also, postF-3D-PHAD\u00ae-proteoliposomes induced significantly higher mean levels of antibodies towards preF compared to mean levels induced by postF-proteoliposomes or non-conjugated postF/3D-PHAD\u00ae liposomes. It is noted that the induction of antibodies towards preF by postF-proteoliposomes is possible due to the presence of shared antigenic sites I, II and IV. PostF-3D-PHAD\u00ae-proteoliposomes induced significantly a higher mean level of postF-specific antibody response than those induced by postF proteoliposomes or non-conjugated postF-3D-PHAD\u00ae liposomes (Figure 4C). PostF-3D-PHAD\u00ae-proteoliposomes induced significantly a higher mean postF-specific antibody response than induced by preF-3D-PHAD\u00ae-proteoliposomes (Figure 4C). Thus, association of both 3D-PHAD\u00ae and antigen with one particle is optimal for the potentiation of preF- or postF-specific antibody responses.Chapter 7150 SEVENWeek 0 Week 3 Week 5Week 7 Day 5 Day 8 Week 5: serum collection Day 5: lung harvest: Plaque assay Day RSV preF and postF in sera of immunized mice. (A) Timeline of immunization and bleeds. Mice were vaccinated twice with different vaccine formulations and control groups were either mice vaccinated with DS-Cav1 + Alum or PBS. Each injection contained 10 \u00b5g of protein. Bleeds were collected 2 weeks after boost vaccination. (B) PreF-specific IgG titers in serum two weeks after booster vaccination. (C) PostF-specific IgG titers in serum two weeks after booster vaccination. Antibody endpoints are shown for each individual animal (10 mice/group). Black dotted lines indicate the baseline for ELISA. Statistical differences were calculated of the induction of virus-neutralizing (VN) antibodies in more detail, sera after the secondary immunization were analyzed for levels of VN antibodies. Two weeks after the booster vaccination, groups immunized with postF-3D-PHAD\u00ae- proteoliposomes demonstrated significantly higher mean levels of VN antibodies compared to the level in the group given non-conjugated-postF/3D-PHAD\u00ae liposomes. Additionally, a trend towards lower VN antibody levels was measured (p<0.0856) in mice immunized with postF proteoliposomes compared to postF-3D-PHAD\u00ae-protoeliposomes, however, this difference is not significant (Figure 5). The dotted line marks the threshold for protection [18]. In all groups receiving preF as an antigen, the mean level of induced VN antibodies was comparable. No significant difference in VN antibodies was observed in groups vaccinated with preF-3D-PHAD\u00ae-proteoliposomes or preF-proteoliposomes. Thus, no boosting effect of 3D-PHAD\u00ae on VN antibody levels was noticed in these groups. Highest levels of VN-antibodies were detected in the group that received DS-Cav1+Alum (Figure 5). Non-conjugated preF/3D-PHAD\u00ae liposomes induced 5 | Vaccine induced virus-neutralizing titers after two immunizations. Mice were vaccinated as described in figure 4.

Dotted line represents the level of neutralizing antibodies that confers protection in mice [18]. Statistical differences ***p<0.001, ****p<0.0001). Vaccine-induced protection if the immunity conferred by the different proteoliposomal formulations confers protection against RSV infection, immunized and non-immunized were challenged i.n. with 2x10 6 TCID50 RSV A2 virus two weeks after the booster vaccination. Five days later, viral titers were determined in the lungs of the mice. Infectious virus could be recovered from the lungs of all non-immunized mice (Figure 6). Also, mice immunized with non-conjugated postF/3D-PHAD\u00ae liposomes were not protected against viral challenge. Some immunized mice from other groups showed low levels of virus, but this was based on the detection of a single PFU in the analyzed lung sample. Cellular immunity induced by F protein proteoliposomes We next investigated if the proteoliposomes induce RSV-F specific CD8 T cells. Mononuclear cells were for intracellular cytokine staining. A representative gating strategy for all groups is shown in Figure 6A. Panel B to D of Figure 6 show the percentage of IL-2-, IFN-, TNF- or IL-5-producing RSV F-specific CD8 cells isolated PreF-3D-PHAD\u00ae-proteoliposomes of RSV-F-specific IL-2, IFN- or TNF-producing RSV F-specific CD8 T cells compared to percentages observed in the Evaluation of preF- and postF-3D-PHAD\u00ae-proteoliposomes153 SEVENgroup immunized IFN- or TNF-producing CD8 T cells in the lungs of mice immunized with preF-3D-PHAD\u00ae-proteoliposomes were significantly higher than the corresponding levels of the lungs of mice immunized with non-conjugated preF/3D-PHAD\u00ae liposomes. Further, in the control group of DS-Cav1 + Alum, a higher percentage of CD8+ IL-5-producing T cells was noticed compared to percentages in groups that were vaccinated with preF or postF-3D-PHAD\u00ae-proteoliposomes. We also noticed higher percentages of CD8+ IL-5 producing T cells in the group vaccinated with non-conjugated postF/3D-PHAD\u00ae liposomes compared to percentages in the group immunized with postF-3D-PHAD\u00ae-proteoliposomes. This was not seen in the different preF-vaccinated groups. From these data we conclude that 3D-PHAD\u00ae in proteolipsomes has the capacity to induce cross-presentation of the associated antigen, leading to activation of | Lung viral titers after RSV challenge of immunized mice. Mice were vaccinated as mentioned in Figure 4 and challenged with live virus 14 days after the booster vaccination. Five days after challenge, lungs of 5 animals per group were removed and the viral titer was determined and expressed in Log (PFU/gLung). Error bars represents the SEM. Dotted line represents the base line of the plaque assay. Statistical differences were calculated with FIGURE 7 | Activation of CD8+ T cells in lung by PreF and PostF conjugated liposomes.

(A) Representative flow cytometry scatterplots for of CD8+ activated cells after peptide re-stimulation of 5 mice per group. Error bars represents the min to max per group. Note different Y-asses. Statistical differences were calculated with Mann-Whitney non-parametric In this study, we evaluated preF- and postF-proteoliposomes for display of functional epitopes and their capacity to induce RSV-F specific IgG antibodies, VN antibodies and cross-presentation in mice. We show that proteoliposomes, containing incorporated 3D-PHAD\u00ae, display preserved functional epitopes after protein conjugation and induce protective antibody responses and RSV-F-specific CD8 T cells after immunization of mice. We produced synthetic liposomes containing a lipid molecule, i.e. DGS-NTA, bearing a chelated nickel (Ni 2+) ion at the NTA head group. We were able to efficiently conjugate a His-tagged form of RSV preF or postF to these liposomes. The protein was coupled to the liposome-incorporated DGS-NTA (Ni 2+) by an electrostatic interaction between the C-terminal His6 and the Ni2+ at the NTA head group. Almost 100% of the added protein was bound to the particles. With the measured protein recovery, we estimated that approximately 300 protein trimers were conjugated per liposomal particle. Conjugation of RSV F to the liposomes was confirmed by cryo-EM and negative-stain EM. Indeed, EM images showed a dense array of protein molecules on the surface of the particles. These results are in agreement with an earlier report of Ingale et al., who observed efficient coupling of HIV-1 BG505 NFL trimer to liposomes containing DGS-NTA [27]. Currently, proteoliposomes carrying DGS-NTA (Ni 2+) have some limitations regarding stability and potential adverse reaction, as was shown by Bale and co-workers [28]. These investigators showed that proteoliposomes using DGS-NTA (Ni 2+) for coupling of His-tagged HIV-1 proteins are less stable in long-term storage compared to proteoliposomes with DGS-NTA (Co 2+) or using covalent Cys-linked conjugation of the protein to the liposomes [28]. Currently, we do not know how long the preF and/or postF particles are stable with respect to conjugation of the protein or if liposomes will aggregate upon prolonged storage. Despite this, we conclude that chelation via DGS-NTA (Ni 2+) is an efficient method to conjugate His-tagged preF and/or postF protein to carrier liposomes. Moreover, with the use of liposomes it is also possible to incorporate a lipophilic adjuvant, for example 3D-PHAD\u00ae, in the same particle that carries the antigen. Both preF and postF display protective epitopes for VN antibodies. Antibodies towards preF can prevent fusion of the virus with its target cell and thus represent potent VN antibodies [7,8]. As mentioned above, virus neutralization requires blocking of preF inhibiting fusion and thus infection. PreF and postF share one important epitope, antigenic site II, and therefore antibodies induced with postF may also neutralize infection [29,30]. It is suggested that antibodies against antigenic site II, like the monoclonal antibody Palivizumab, currently used for preventive treatment in high-risk groups [10,11], do not prevent the conformational change of preF but interfere, by an unknown mechanism, with the fusion process of viral and host cell membranes [19]. Besides antigenic site-II, site III (preF>postF), site IV (equally present on preF and postF) and site I (postF>preF) are also epitopes that can induce VN antibodies [12]. In our experiment, we used the stabilized Evaluation of preF- and postF-3D-PHAD\u00ae-proteoliposomes157 SEVENpreF, i.e.DS-Cav1 [18], conjugation of DS-Cav1, antigenic epitopes were still intact and accessible for antibodies specific for epitopes displayed in the prefusion conformation state. Proteoliposomes have the advantage of being fully synthetic and besides conjugation of RSV preF and/or postF, it is possible to conjugate a stabilized version of the G glycoprotein to these particles. The addition of G protein will additionally induce VN antibodies which are also helpful for protection against natural virus infection [31]. Thus, conjugation of preF and G protein, or a mixture of preF, postF and G protein could induce optimal VN antibodies. Coupling of preF and postF trimers results in multimeric presentation of the antigen which stimulates B cell activation compared to soluble preF or postF antigen. The multimeric presentation of the antigen allows efficient cross-linking of B cell receptors (BCR) [32]. Ingale et al. showed that their liposomes with conjugated HIV-1 trimers are far more efficient in activating B cells in vitro and inducing germinal center reactions in vivo compared to soluble trimers [27]. In line with these findings, we found that preF or postF-3D-PHAD\u00ae-proteoliposomes induced higher preF- and postF-specific IgG antibody levels compared to levels induced by non-conjugated preF- or postF mixed with 3D-PHAD\u00ae-liposomes. RSV preF or postF on liposomes results in more efficient B cell activation and RSV-F-specific IgG antibody production upon immunization in mice. Antibodies that target the recently discovered antigenic site \u00d8, that is only present on the prefusion form of F, have a 10- to 100-fold greater VN potency than Palivizumab [18]. As already shown by McLellan et al., immunization with a stabilized version of preF trimer induces significantly higher VN antibody responses than immunization with a postF antigen, mainly because of the presence of antigenic site \u00d8 [18]. We did not see a significant difference in VN antibody levels in the groups vaccinated with preF-3D-PHAD\u00ae-proteoliposomes, preF-proteoliposomes, postF-3D-PHAD\u00ae-proteoliposomes, or postF-proteoliposomes. But antibodies than non-conjugated postF/3D-PHAD\u00ae liposomes. More research is necessary to provide insights in the specificity of the proteoliposome-induced antibodies, e.g. to what extent they are directed against, for example, antigenic site \u00d8 or site II. Cross-presentation is an important process for initiation of CD8 T cell responses. With cross-presentation, not only proteins synthesized within the APCs, but also exogenous protein antigens can be presented in the context of MHC class I by APCs. Activation of APCs, especially full maturation of DCs, is an important mechanism in addition to the delivery of antigen to the cytosol in DCs during cross-presentation [33]. Only fully mature and activated DCs are able to successfully induce CTL responses. Incorporation of a TLR4-stimulating adjuvant should lead to the induction of activation of the adaptive immune system. LPS-derived MPLA, is known to induce activation and maturation of DCs [34]. MPLA can activate TLR4 through MyD88, transduction from the plasma Chapter 7158 SEVENmembrane. Additionally, through another pathway, TLR4 is internalized, after interacting with MPLA, into endocytic compartments and subsequently, activation of TLR4 engages TRIF [35,36]. Several groups have shown that co-delivery of antigen and adjuvant induces activation of CTL responses through cross-presentation of the exogenous antigen [37-39]. In IL-2-, IFN- or TNF-producing CD8+ T cells was observed after immunization of mice with preF- or postF-3D-PHAD\u00ae-proteoliposomes. This confirms that co-delivery of the antigen and adjuvant using proteoliposomes leads to efficient delivery of proteoliposomal antigen to the MHC class I route of antigen presentation by cross-presentation and underlines the importance of delivering adjuvant and antigen in one particle. In summary, preF- and/or postF-3D-PHAD\u00ae-proteoliposomes have the capacity to induce protective antibody responses upon immunization of mice. Moreover, cellular immunity with activation of RSV-specific CD8 T cells is induced. Proteoliposomes are easy to fine-tune and the choice of antigen is flexible, as other groups have shown with different proteins [27,28,40,41]. We conclude that proteoliposomes represent a promising approach towards RSV vaccine development. Evaluation of preF- Singleton RJ, et al.

Nonetheless, the need for such a vaccine remains urgent since RSV is a major pathogen, causing considerable morbidity and mortality among different target groups, including infants and the elderly [1,2]. There have been many hurdles on the way toward an effective RSV vaccine. Difficulties have been twofold. First, the disastrous outcome of the 1960 vaccine trial, in which children were vaccinated with an alum-precipitated, formalin-inactivated vaccine (FI-RSV) [3,4]. Upon vaccination, natural infection resulted in enhanced disease, due to which two children died [3,4]. Even though the FI-RSV vaccine induced high titers of RSV-specific antibodies, these antibodies appeared to have weak virus-neutralizing activity [5,6]. There is no doubt that the disastrous outcome of this trial and the fear of another vaccine failure have severely impeded the development of an RSV vaccine. Secondly, RSV vaccine development has also been hampered by a lack of knowledge about the immunological correlates of protection against RSV infection. Indeed, natural RSV infection does not lead to life-long protection and re-infection may occur several times later on in life [1]. The basis of frequent re-infection is still unknown. One possibility could be an ineffective primary infection which does not lead to sustained immunological protection. In addition, it is still not completely clear why RSV infection causes such severe disease in infants. It has been suggested that it is a combination of the limitations of the infant's immune system together with viral mechanisms of immune subversion and environmental factors that result in severe disease [7-9]. The lack of insight in the immunological correlates of protection have made it difficult to define the requirements and characteristics of a potential RSV vaccine. During the course of RSV vaccine research over the past decades, it has become increasingly clear that different vaccine modalities may be required for different target populations [10,11]. The distinction between these target groups is whether the subject is na\u00efve to RSV antigen and, thus, vaccination will be the first priming event, or whether the subject has already experienced a natural RSV infection and vaccination thus involves boosting of pre-existing immunity. The most important target groups for vaccination include infants (< 6 months of age), young children (> 6 months of age), pregnant women, and the elderly and immunocompromised individuals. A live-attenuated virus vaccine mimicking exposure to wild-type RSV will probably be most suitable for RSV-na\u00efve infants and young children. However, since natural infection with RSV does not lead to life-long protection, one may question the potential efficacy of a live-attenuated vaccine. In addition, the development of an attenuated virus is challenging, since it is difficult to produce a virus that is neither under- nor over-attenuated. An alternative strategy for Summarizing discussion and future perspectives165 EIGHTprotecting newborns, gaining considerable interest recently, is to vaccinate mothers during the third trimester of pregnancy [10]. In this approach, maternal RSV-specific antibodies are transported through the placenta to the unborn child [12]. Finally, with respect to the elderly and immunocompromised individuals, it is the dysfunction of the immune system that causes symptomatic disease after RSV infection, despite previous priming of the immune system by earlier infections. In this group, pre-existing immune responses need to be boosted, preferably with a particle-based formulation containing a powerful adjuvant, as further discussed below [13-15]. Requirements for an RSV Vaccine Ideally, an RSV vaccine candidate for the elderly should be designed in such a way that it boosts memory immune responses and induces high levels of virus-neutralizing (VN) antibodies blocking infection. Antibodies towards prefusion F glycoprotein (preF) prevent virus cell entry as a result of inhibition of the viral fusion process with the target cell membrane. Antibodies directed against site \u00d8, which is only present on preF, neutralize the virus 10- to 100-fold more efficiently compared to antibodies directed against antigenic site II, such as Palivizumab [16]. Antibodies towards antigenic site I, II, and IV, which are displayed on both preF and postF, also contribute to neutralization [16,17]. It has been shown in several studies that RSV infection induces a rise in antibody levels, which then decline within two years to a non-sufficient protection level [18,19]. The induction of potently neutralizing antibodies as well as an effective immunological memory by vaccination is thus of utmost importance to retain a sufficient protection level. Virus-neutralizing (VN) antibodies can diminish the number of infected cells from the initial infection and delay the spread of the virus into the lower airways. However, once infection has been established, T-cells are critical for complete viral clearance. Thus, the ideal vaccine should also stimulate CD8 T-cell immunity. Important signals, needed to prime na\u00efve T-cells to become functional cytotoxic T-cells (CTLs), include presentation of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecule-peptide complexes, and the expression of co-stimulatory molecules, like CD80 and CD86, on mature antigen-presenting cells (APCs). Through the of cross-presentation, non-infected APCs may take up exogenous antigens and present them on MHC class I molecules to T-cells [20]. This mechanism is mostly used by dendritic cells (DCs) if they are not directly infected. Additionally, only DCs that are fully mature and activated can successfully cross-present exogenous antigens. For cross-presentation, a particulate antigen is taken up by endocytosis or phagocytosis and, subsequently, the antigen escapes into either the cytosolic or vacuolar pathway of cross-presentation [21]. It of APCs induces the recruitment of transporters of antigenic peptides (TAP) to the early endosome. Exogenous antigens that are transported into the cytosol, are processed to peptides by the proteasome and imported by TAP from the cytosol to the endosome for loading onto MHC class I molecules [23]. Incorporation of a TLR4-adjuvant in a (particulate) vaccine, that stimulates APCs, therefore, will lead to activation of the adaptive immune system, including RSV-specific CD8 T cells, which is needed for the full protective effect of vaccination. Consequently, as will be discussed later, adjuvants play a crucial role in the induction of T-cell immunity. An RSV candidate vaccine should also be stable upon long-term storage and additionally should have a low toxicity profile without reducing the vaccine's immunogenicity and efficacy. Furthermore, the vaccine needs to be amenable to production under GMP conditions. Especially aggregation of particulate vaccine antigen is not acceptable in the context of GMP guidelines [24]. Besides that, adjuvants included in the vaccine need to have an excellent safety profile with the lowest possible chance of immediate adverse effects like pain, swelling or fever or any other adjuvant-associated problem upon injection. It should be noted that in pregnant women, potential adverse effects of adjuvanted vaccines on pregnancy have not been extensively studied yet [25]. prior research and aims of the project at the start This thesis is based on a 2+2 sandwich PhD trajectory involving a close collaboration between industry (Mymetics BV, Leiden, The Netherlands) and academia (University Medical Center in Groningen - UMCG - in Groningen, The Netherlands). The first two years of this particular PhD trajectory were accomplished at the premises of Mymetics BV in Leiden and the last two years at the UMCG. This unique cooperative project fuses industry and academia together and besides that, information was gained about how to work in an industrial surrounding compared to academia. Here we set out to develop an efficacious RSV vaccine for the elderly and/or pregnant women based on virosome technology. Mymetics BV has extensive expertise in the area of virosomal vaccine development. Besides the RSV virosomal vaccine candidate, Mymetics BV is also developing virosomal vaccines for HIV/AIDS, malaria, influenza, and chikungunya virus infection. As mentioned previously, vaccination of the elderly or pregnant women relies on boosting of pre-existing immune responses. Here, we describe a particle-based vaccine formulation, based on the use of virosomes, containing a built-in adjuvant. Virosomes are reconstituted viral envelopes that contain all the membrane glycoproteins of the virus, but lack the viral nucleocapsid containing the viral genome. Due to the removal of the nucleocapsid, virosomes are non-replicating particles. During reconstitution an adjuvant, Summarizing and future perspectives167 EIGHTderived from the TLR4 ligand Monophosphoryl lipid A (MPLA), is incorporated in the virosomal membrane. Earlier studies of Stegmann et al. and Kamphuis et al. have shown that RSV virosomes, with an incorporated Pam3CSK4 (a TLR2 ligand) or MPLA adjuvant, administered intramuscularly, induce protective levels of VN antibodies, a favorable balanced Th1/Th2 response, and no signs of enhanced respiratory disease (ERD) upon virus infection in mice and cotton rats [26-28]. Moreover, these virosomes were also tested by Shafique et al. for their immunogenicity when administered through the mucosal route of vaccination [26]. Upon intranasal administration, virosomes induced not only RSV-specific serum IgG antibodies but also local IgA antibody responses in the upper and lower respiratory tract. Also, the vaccine conferred protection against a virus challenge without signs of ERD. Our aim in the present study was to optimize the RSV virosomal vaccine candidate that as described by Kamphuis et al., Stegmann et al. and Shafique et al. [26-29]. We set out to improve the formulation of the vaccine by testing a synthetic variant of MPLA. Additionally, the vaccine's long-term stability was monitored. Furthermore, we attempted to improve the capacity of virosomes to induce VN antibodies by employing thermostable virus strains with enhanced preF stability. Finally, with the knowledge that we gained from the initial virosome studies, we improved the concept of virosomes by switching to synthetic liposomes with conjugated stabilized recombinant preF and/or postF glycoprotein derived from RSV. The choice of the adjuvant The addition of an adjuvant is crucial in the development of an RSV vaccine for the elderly or pregnant women since it will stimulate antibody responses and help to induce cross-presentation of viral antigens. To date, only a few adjuvants are accepted for use in human vaccines [30]. MPLA is a derivative of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and 10,000x less toxic than LPS. MPLA is one of the adjuvants that is already used in vaccines licensed for use in humans with an acceptable safety profile [31]. The molecule is lipophilic; therefore, it is possible to incorporate it into the membrane of virosomes. MPLA is a TLR4-agonist and has been shown to stimulate/boost the immune response against antigens with which it is co-administered [32]. The characteristics of MPLA were reasons to use this molecule for our studies. In Chapter 2 we investigated in detail the immunoactivating properties of RSV-MPLA virosomes in vitro and in vivo. Using a with an inducible secreted embryonic alkaline phosphatase gene that is fused to the NFB and AP-1 binding site, we showed that the TLR4-activating capacity of RSV virosomes is strongly enhanced Chapter 8168 EIGHTby the incorporation of MPLA in the virosomal membrane. Also, upregulation of co- stimulatory molecules in DCs is enhanced when the cells are incubated with RSV-MPLA virosomes. MPLA has been shown to induce a TRIF-based signaling cascade upon TLR4 activation. Additional activation through MyD88 is likely and transcription factors that are induced downstream of both adaptor molecules stimulate the induction of type-I IFN (via TRIF) and NFB (via MyD88) [33]. As TLR4 is expressed on different immune cells, including DCs and B cells [34], multiple effects of the virosome-incorporated TLR ligand on these cells are to be expected, including activation of these cells and expression of co-stimulatory molecules. In Chapter 3, we were interested if we can replace MPLA with a synthetic variant of the molecule. A switch to a synthetic, well-defined version of MPLA is advantageous for use under conditions of GMP . This will reduce the possibility of batch-to-batch variation during vaccine production significantly. Particularly, the bioactivity of the adjuvant is better controlled as it consists of a single variant of the MPLA molecule -with known bioactivity- instead of a mix of different variants of MPLA, with varying bioactivity, as is the case with LPS-derived MPLA. However, the synthetic adjuvant replacement should not lead to reduced immunopotentiating properties, therefore the potency of the synthetic adjuvant should be at least similar to that of LPS-derived MPLA. We evaluated the direct and indirect effects of virosome-incorporated MPLA on DC and B cell activation and isotype switching in vitro with two MPLA variants: 3-OD-MPLA and 3-OD-MPLA, a derivative of MPLA produced by alkaline hydrolysis, is already present in marketed vaccines, like Cervarix\u00ae [35,36], and PHAD\u00ae is currently tested in the context of influenza vaccines in pre-clinical non-human primate trials [37]. The MPLA variant 3-OD-MPLA contains a phosphorylated carbohydrate backbone and variable numbers of acyl chains that also vary in length. PHAD\u00ae, however, contains six 14-carbon fatty acid acyl groups and is synthetic [38]. In vitro, the three studied variants of MPLA, incorporated in virosomes, had the same potential to activate murine DCs. Furthermore, in vivo, the different MPLA-containing virosomes induced a ratio of IgG1 to IgG2a antibodies similar to that observed with LPS-derived MPLA incorporated in virosomes in Chapter 2. Direct signaling on B cells through TLR4 is sufficient to support B cell proliferation and IgG1 production, although IFN in addition appears to be important for fine-tuning of the IgG subtype switch towards IgG2a [39-41]. Indeed, we observed a reduced IgG1 production when IFN was added to B cells cultured with anti-CD40 and virosomes with different MPLAs (Chapter 3). Indirect effects on antibody production and subtype switch can also be mediated by soluble factors produced by DCs upon their stimulation [39]. The data in Chapter 3 revealed that not only native MPLA, but also 3-OD-MPLA and PHAD\u00ae, incorporated in virosomes, are capable of activating DC and B cells, and inducing an IgG subtype switch (from IgG1 to IgG2a). Since DC and B cell activation was not different with the two alternative variants of MPLA and Summarizing discussion and future perspectives169 EIGHTisotype switching was induced, albeit at a lower level compared to that induced by LPS- derived MPLA, we decided to use synthetic MPLA which is more suitable for production under conditions of GMP than the semisynthetic 3-OD-MPLA. A fully synthetic alternative to 3-OD-MPLA or PHAD\u00ae, which is preferred under GMP conditions, is 3D-PHAD\u00ae. It is a single synthetic MPLA molecule compared to the mixture of different molecules in 3-OD-MPLA or PHAD\u00ae. 3D-PHAD\u00ae is identical to one of the most active molecules present in 3-desacyl MPLA and similar to PHAD\u00ae. Since 3D-PHAD\u00ae seems to have the characteristics of a promising synthetic adjuvant, we used this well-defined molecule in our subsequent studies. In Chapter 4 we studied the induction of protective VN antibodies and cellular immunity, i.e. RSV-specific CD8 T-cells, upon immunization of mice with RSV comparison with virosomes containing LPS-derived MPLA. Surprisingly, 3D-PHAD\u00ae virosomes were potentiating RSV-specific Similar results were found by Genito et al. who used a soluble malaria circumsporozite protein vaccine adjuvanted with 3D-PHAD\u00ae and QS21 [43]. Increased B and T cells responses and higher IgG2c antibody titers were found when C57BL/6J mice were immunized with the 3D-PHAD\u00ae/QS21-containing malaria vaccine compared to immunization with vaccine formulations without 3D-PHAD\u00ae, underlining the potent adjuvant activity of 3D-PHAD\u00ae on humoral responses and also T cell responses [43]. The synthetic version of MPLA, 3D-PHAD\u00ae, thus appears to be an excellent replacement for MPLA as it has strong immune-stimulatory capacity, it is advantageous for use under GMP conditions, and it has a safety profile similar to that of LPS-derived MPLA [42]. Clearly, 3D-PHAD\u00ae is the preferred adjuvant for use in a virosomal RSV vaccine. Lower levels of the synthetic adjuvant could further improve the safety of the vaccine. In Chapter 6, low levels of the adjuvant 3D-PHAD\u00ae incorporated in RSV virosomes appeared to be sufficient to boost IgG levels and induce a balanced IgG1/IgG2a response in vivo. Current commercially available vaccines, like Cervarix\u00ae or Fendrix\u00ae [35,44], use 1250 \u00b5g or even 2500 \u00b5g per mg of vaccine protein. In Chapter 6, 18 \u00b5g 3D-PHAD\u00ae per mg of vaccine protein boosted (VN) antibody responses and induced IgG2a-type antibodies. Also, 66 \u00b5g 3D-PHAD\u00ae per mg of virosomal protein was as effective as a high level of 460 \u00b5g 3D-PHAD\u00ae per mg vaccine antigen, a dose used in a previous study of this project. These adjuvant levels are at least 19-fold lower compared to the levels of MPLA used in the commercial vaccines. The potent immune response induced by RSV virosomes containing relatively low amounts of 3D-PHAD\u00ae, as described in Chapter 6, is likely due to the improved bio-availability of 3D-PHAD\u00ae and its tight association with the virosomal Chapter 8170 EIGHTmembrane that carries also the vaccine antigens. The use of low concentrations of an adjuvant in human vaccines is a considerable advantage, especially when the vaccine is to be used for vaccination of pregnant women [25]. Virosome characterization Another important feature of GMP production is related to quality control. Besides a low toxicity profile and high immunogenicity of the vaccine, the manufacturability of the final product under GMP conditions is also of importance. In Chapter 5, quantities of 3D-PHAD\u00ae and lipids incorporated in RSV virosomes were evaluated as well as the long-term stability of the particles. After weeks to months of storage, we noticed that the virosomes sedimented which suggests that they aggregate over time. However, during a follow-up study of ten months, the size distribution of the stored virosomes remained almost the same with only a small increase in particles > 150 nm. Thus, the sedimentation that occurred during storage is largely reversible and the virosomes appeared to be stable. Moreover, the virosomes retain the two major envelope glycoproteins F and G in a similar ratio compared to the ratio in the native virus. Initially, a relatively low recovery of 3D-PHAD\u00ae was observed after virosome production. This loss of adjuvant was noticed upon filtration of the dissolved dry-lipid film with DCPC. It appeared that under this condition only a fraction of 3D-PHAD\u00ae was completely solubilized, even though the solution appeared clear to the naked eye. Probably aggregates or micelles of 3D-PHAD\u00ae are subsequently lost during the filtration step. In Chapter 5, several techniques were used to improve the incorporation of 3D-PHAD\u00ae in the virosomal membrane. During the final optimization process, the yield of incorporated 3D-PHAD\u00ae was improved by pre-dissolving 3D-PHAD\u00ae in DMSO and adding this mixture to preformed virosomes. Under these conditions, the adjuvant was essentially quantitatively inserted into the virosomal membrane. Improvement of the virosome concept In the course of our studies, we encountered various issues related to the virosome production process. During the virus solubilization step, probably a fraction of the metastable preF protein flips into its stable postF form (unpublished observations). This premature conformational change of the F protein is possibly due to the loss of anchoring of F in the virus membrane and its concomitant dissociation from the matrix protein [45,46]. Yet, it is very important not to lose the preF conformation of the F glycoprotein in an RSV vaccine, Indeed, recent failures of RSV vaccines based on the use of postF antigen, like the subunit vaccine of Novavax [47], support the use of F glycoprotein antigen in its Summarizing discussion and future perspectives171 EIGHTpreF conformation, such that more potent VN antibody responses are induced. Currently, a subunit vaccine which contains a stabilized version of preF (DS-Cav1) is being evaluated in initial clinical trials [48]. In Chapter 6, we compared virosomes derived from RSV A2 with virosomes derived from two thermostable virus strains with increased preF stability. L19F was originally derived from a sick infant at the University of Michigan in 1967 [49]. The other strain is a mutated version of L19F, L19F I557V, with a mutation leading to a substitution of isoleucine for valine in the membrane anchor sequence of the viral F glycoprotein [50]. Both strains display a higher thermostability and higher levels of preF compared to RSV A2 [51]. Indeed, virosomes produced from these two strains were found to have an increased capacity to induce VN antibodies compared to RSV A2 virosomes (Chapter 6), but, they did not induce higher levels of preF-specific IgG titers compared to levels induced by RSV A2 virosomes. Perhaps, solubilization of the viral envelope proteins with DCPC induces some conversion of preF into postF regardless of the thermostability of the (envelope-anchored) protein. Additionally, it is also not known if the thermostable strains contain overall more viral F glycoprotein compared to RSV A2 virions. Thus, thermostable strains L19F or L19F I557V are suitable vaccine candidates. However, more research is needed to validate (and perhaps improve) the level of preF that is present on virosomes derived from these thermostable virus strains. An alternative and potential improvement to the original virosomal vaccine is presented in Chapter 7, where we evaluated a novel RSV vaccine concept: proteoliposomes. These liposomes contain a lipid molecule, DGS-NTA(Ni 2+), bearing a chelated nickel ion at the polar head group. His-tagged (recombinant) proteins may be coupled through an electrostatic interaction between the His-tag and the Ni 2+ ion of the DGS-NTA(Ni2+). Using this approach, it is possible to produce proteoliposomes that carry (recombinantly expressed and His-tagged) stabilized preF or postF. Different groups have already developed proteoliposomes with other proteins conjugated to liposomes in a similar manner [52-55]. In Chapter 7, we created preF- or postF-proteoliposomes with a high density of conjugated protein on their surface. Based on recovered protein and lipids, we calculated that one proteoliposome has an preF trimers or ~200 trimers conjugated to the outer surface of the liposomal membrane. In Chapter 5 we found that the F protein incorporated in the virosomal membrane is present at a lower concentration than on a virion. This is due to the addition of synthetic phospholipids and cholesterol during virosome production. The ratio of recovered protein and phospholipid of the virosomes is approximately 1:1 (1 \u00b5mol phospholipid/ 1 mg protein). Approximately one third of the recovered protein is the Matrix (M) protein. In Chapter 8172 EIGHTChapter 5 we measured an F to G ratio of 5.3:1 on the virosomes. Thus, one mg of virosomal protein probably contains 0.33 mg M protein, 0.13 mg G protein and 0.54 mg F protein. Additionally, during reconstitution of the virosomes, the viral envelope glycoproteins appear to be randomly incorporated into the virosomal membrane, with part of the proteins' ectodomains being oriented toward the exterior surface of the virosomes and part toward the virosomal lumen. This was already noticed with influenza virosomes [61], and implies that fewer spikes are presented on the surface of virosomes compared to virion particles, even though the membrane protein/lipid ratio is the same in either case. In the proteoliposomes described in Chapter 7, the ratio of lipid and protein was also 1:1. However, compared to virosomes, clearly, more F protein is presented on the surface of the proteoliposomes, since all F trimers are conjugated to the outer leaflet of the liposomal membrane. We calculated that each proteolipossome particle contains on average 300 F protein trimers. If we compare this to virosomes, of which 0.54 mg F protein is recovered and 50% of the protein is outwards orientated, only 75 trimers per particle are presented on the outer surface. Furthermore, characterization by cryo-EM of preF- and postF-proteoliposomes revealed uniform densely packed spherical particles, carrying antigens that display intact epitopes, like antigenic site \u00d8 on preF (Chapter 7). Proteoliposomes have several advantages compared to RSV virosomes. The production of proteoliposomes does not require the culture of virus, the particles are fully synthetic, the adjuvant 3D-PHAD\u00ae is easy to incorporate during production and proteoliposomes can carry higher levels of F protein than found in RSV virosomes. On the other hand, the recombinant RSV F needed for the proteoliposomes, needs to be produced in high quantities in cell culture and purified, which can be expensive. Taken together, proteoliposomes form an attractive alternative to virosomes for use in a future RSV vaccine. Vaccine-induced immunity One of the vaccine requirements mentioned previously is the induction of high VN antibody titers to prevent binding and/or fusion of the virus to the target cell [17]. RSV A2 virosomes with MPLA induce VN antibodies, in levels that are protective in mice after virus challenge (Chapter 2). In Chapter 4, RSV A2 virosomes with 3D-PHAD\u00ae induce even higher mice compared to MPLA-containing virosomes. VN antibody titers were further increased when mice were vaccinated with 3D-PHAD\u00ae virosomes produced with the L19F mutant strain (Chapter 6). The incorporation of MPLA or 3D-PHAD\u00ae in the virosomes leads to the induction of antibodies with higher neutralizing capacity, possibly through improved antibody affinity maturation. Generally, inclusion of TLR ligands in vaccines has been shown to facilitate the induction of high-affinity antibodies [56]. Finally, 3D-PHAD\u00ae-containing preF-proteoliposomes induced but not significantly higher VN antibodies (Chapter 7). The latter was expected, based on the outcome of ELISA antibody levels. Notably, neutralization titers in most groups showed a rather high variance which highly influenced the outcome of the statistical comparison between groups. A higher (intra-assay) variance in the NIH neutralization assay used in Chapter 7 -compared to variance observed in the UMCG variant of the neutralization assay (Chapters 2, 4, 5 and 6)- may have obscured the boosting effect of MPLA on VN antibody titers . Clearly, both virosomes and preF-proteoliposomes induced protective levels of VN antibodies in mice, as evidenced by the protection of virosome/proteoliposome-immunized mice against viral infection (Chapters 2, 4, 6 and 7). The cellular arm of the adaptive immune system aids in reducing virus infection. As described previously, an RSV vaccine should induce CD8 T cells, e.g. CTL, responses to clear already infected cells. Early studies with influenza virosomes by Stegmann et al. revealed that reconstituted virosomes retain the membrane-fusion capacity of the native virus or whole inactivated virus particles (WIV) [57,58]. Due to the fusion activity of the viral HA, virosome-encapsulated antigen, or the nucleocapsid in case of WIV, is deposited in the cytosol of APCs, where it is processed to peptides by proteasomes, thereby providing access to the MHC class I presentation route [59]. For a long time it was believed that only this route leads to MHC class-I restricted antigen processing which implements that only fusion-active virosomes (or WIV particles) are able to induce a MHC class I-restricted CTL responses, as only fusion-active virosomes or WIV particles would have the capacity to deposit antigens in the cytosol of APCs [59]. However, Budimir et al. noticed only with fusion-active WIV primes NP-specific CTLs activation in vivo, but also vaccination with fusion-inactive WIV, albeit to a significantly lower extent [60]. This means that fusion activity, with deposition of antigen into the cytosol is not mandatory for MHC class-I restricted antigen processing and induction of CTLs. It has been established that APCs can also process exogenous antigens, e.g. antigens taken up through phagocytosis or endocytosis, and present peptides thereof in the context of MHC class I molecules. This process is referred to as 'cross-presentation' . In order to induce cross-presentation, vaccine particles should properly activate the APC through, for example, TLRs on APCs. A TLR ligand, such as single-stranded RNA of WIV or virosomal MPLA (a TLR4 ligand) should therefore be included in the vaccine particle in order to induce cross-presentation [61]. It is not known whether RSV virosomes are fusogenic like influenza virosomes. But, as mentioned above, the incorporation of a TLR4-stimulating adjuvant in RSV virosomes most likely potentiates CD8 T cell activation by DCs through the induction of cross-presentation of exogeneous antigen, thereby (in part) bypassing the need for fusogenic activity of the particles. Chapter 8174 EIGHTThe incorporation of MPLA in a particle, like RSV virosomes or proteoliposomes, allows delivery of both antigen and adjuvant at the same time to the same APC, leading to efficient activation of the target cell. Virosomal MPLA activates TLR4 through the myeloid differentiation primary-response protein initiating signal transduction from the plasma membrane. Subsequently TLR4 is internalized into endocytic compartments and activation of TLR4 engages TRIF. It is important to note that simultaneous activation of the MyD88 and TRIF pathways is important for priming adaptive T cell responses [62]. In Chapter 4, RSV-F specific IFN-producing CD8 T cells could be observed in the 3D-PHAD\u00ae virosome vaccinated groups. Clearly, these class-I MHC-restricted CD8 T cells must have been induced by the vaccine. In Chapter 7 we showed that immunization of mice with proteoliposomes with 3D-PHAD\u00ae induces higher and TNF-producing CD8+ T-cells in lungs of infected mice compared to numbers induced by soluble antigen mixed with 3D-PHAD\u00ae-containing liposomes. This means that virosomal and proteoliposomal antigens must have gained access to the MHC class I route of antigen cross-presentation. Incorporation of the adjuvant 3D-PHAD\u00ae most likely results in adequate activation of DCs via the TLR4 receptor, like LPS-derived MPLA does. Several groups have shown that co-delivery of antigen and adjuvant are required for the induction of primary CD8+ CTL responses [63-65]. Thus, antigens that conjugated to 3D-PHAD\u00ae-containing proteoliposomes or incorporated in the virosomal membrane are able to enter the cross-presentation pathway of DCs to finally activate CD8+ CTL responses. This underlines the immunopotentiating effect of delivering adjuvant and antigen in one particle. Indeed, the incorporation of the adjuvant in the particle does not only improve immunogenicity of the vaccine in terms of antibody induction but can also lead to the induction of a cell-mediated immune responses To summarize, both virosomes and proteoliposomes with incorporated 3D-PHAD\u00ae induce protective levels of neutralizing antibodies and CD8+ T-cell responses. Concluding remarks and future perspectives Based on the data presented in this thesis, we conclude that RSV virosomes and proteoliposomes, with 3D-PHAD\u00ae as an immunomodulating adjuvant, represent promising RSV vaccine candidates. As described previously, an RSV vaccine should meet the following requirements: 1) optimal induction of VN antibodies against antigenic site \u00d8, II, IV and V, 2) induction of antigen-specific CD8 T-cell responses 3) stability upon long-term storage and 4) robust production under GMP conditions. So far, we have shown that RSV virosomes and proteoliposomes fulfill a number of these requirements. Because of the presence of the F protein, RSV virosomes and proteoliposomes induce protective VN titers. However, at what levels antibodies towards Summarizing discussion and future perspectives175 EIGHTantigenic site \u00d8, II, III, IV and V are induced needs to be further investigated. The adjuvant 3D-PHAD\u00ae aids in induction of CD8 T-cells. Additionally, 3D-PHAD\u00ae in RSV virosomes resulted in a balanced Th1/Th2 immune response, as evidenced by the induction of Th1-signature IgG2a isotype antibodies, in addition to the induction of Th2-signature IgG1 isotype antibodies. Furthermore, our experiments show that 3D-PHAD\u00ae virosomes are stable after long-term storage. Whether or not RSV virosomes or proteoliposomes will induce a robust immune response in humans, as has been shown in mice, has to be assessed in clinical trials. At least for two target populations, newborns and the elderly, an RSV vaccine is urgently needed. As described, these groups have notable differences in the properties of their immune system. Due to the immaturity of the immune system of newborns, this population may not benefit optimally from vaccination. However, with the vaccination of pregnant women in the last trimester, newborns may well be protected during the first few, most vulnerable, months after birth. It is important that a vaccine for pregnant women induces high titers of VN IgG antibodies in the mother, as this will lead to translocation of sufficiently high levels of VN IgG to the (unborn) child resulting in protection against RSV infection. Besides indirect protection of newborns by their mothers' antibodies, an attenuated virus vaccine could further support the induction of protective immunity. However, this vaccine may be more suitable when the newborn has grown to the age of three to six months. Therefore, protecting the most vulnerable group, the newborns, through their mother will probably be safer and more efficient than vaccinating newborns with an attenuated virus vaccine. The elderly suffer from an age-related dysfunction of the immune system. Specifically, a decline in cell signaling efficiency and CD4+ T cell function can contribute to a reduced vaccine efficacy [66]. In the elderly, incorporation of the adjuvant might not only improve immunogenicity of the vaccine but also act on APCs to produce inflammatory cytokines that support a boosting of the aged immune system. A particle-based or subunit vaccine containing a strong adjuvant will be the most suitable vaccine for this target group. In this thesis, two possible RSV vaccine candidates, RSV virosomes and proteoliposomes, were analyzed and discussed. Both vaccines are promising RSV vaccine candidates. However, several questions remain. Which of these two candidates is more immunogenic and/or which of these two vaccines is easier to produce and more cost-effective in large-scale production? Both vaccines should be compared in a head-to-head animal experiment to determine if there is a difference in the induction of RSV-specific IgG antibodies, VN antibodies and RSV-specific CD8 T cells. Clearly, proteoliposomes have the advantage of being fully synthetic, they are easier to produce under GMP and their production may be less labor-intensive than production of virosomes. However, the use of DGS-NTA(Ni 2+) Chapter 8176 EIGHTcould have some drawbacks. For example, the conjugation of His-tagged protein to the nickel ion has proven to be not that strong [52]. These particles might therefore be less stable during long-term storage, although using cobalt as an alternative to nickel has been shown to improve the binding stability of protein antigens [52]. Also, the production of high amounts of recombinant stabilized protein can be labor-intensive and expensive. Furthermore, a number of aspects of proteoliposomes need to be further explored, like their stability, optimal lipid composition and the antigens that they carry. With respect to the latter, the addition of G-protein to the vaccine could induce additional VN antibodies which are also helpful to prevent natural infection [67]. Furthermore, a mixture of preF and postF presented on proteoliposomes could result in a different composition of RSV-specific IgG antibodies induced by antigenic sites that are differentially displayed on preF and postF, such as sites \u00d8, I, II, III, IV and V. This composition may be steered towards an antibody response with optimal virus-neutralizing capacity by changing ratios of preF to postF. So far, proteoliposomes carrying stabilized preF, i.e. DS-Cav1 [15], have induced protective levels of VN antibodies in mice, but the levels are not as high as those induced by soluble DS-Cav1 co-administered with alum to mice (Chapter 7). Additionally, proteoliposomes probably do not have the fusogenic characteristics of influenza virosomes or WIV because of the stabilization of the preF conformation. DS-Cav1 is probably able to bind to the cells' target receptor but fusion cannot take place since the protein is not able to change its conformation. However, the incorporation of 3D-PHAD into the proteoliposomes, as mentioned previously, allows the delivery of both antigen and adjuvant at the same time, leading to efficient activation of the target cell. Furthermore, our preF-protoeliposomes induced RSV-specific CD8 T-cells, probably through cross-presentation. DS-Cav1 shows promise as a (component of) future RSV vaccine(s): DS-Cav1 combined with alum is currently used in a clinical trial [48]. Besides DS-Cav1, many other promising vaccine approaches are currently under development. The focus in RSV vaccine development remains mostly on vaccine designs based on the F protein in its pre- or postfusion conformation. Novavax is currently the farthest in RSV vaccine development, however, their vaccine contains postF, which might not be ideal to induce sufficient protection. Additionally, not much information is available about the long-term protection afforded by those vaccine candidates. To date, there is not a uniform reporting system to present data on RSV-neutralizing antibodies, like for influenza. This makes it difficult to compare RSV vaccine candidates with each other. The RSV community is currently working to implement an international unit/standard to report neutralization data which hopefully in future will help to compare different clinical trials.Summarizing discussion and future perspectives177 EIGHTTaken together, the data presented in this thesis, demonstrate that RSV virosomes or proteoliposomes containing 3D-PHAD\u00ae as an adjuvant, represent promising RSV vaccine candidates. We optimized and improved the RSV virosomal vaccine that was earlier described by Kamphuis et al., Stegmann et al. and Shafique et al. [26-28] and improved the capacity of virosomes to induce VN antibodies by employing thermostable virus strains with a stabilized preF. Considering the advantages and disadvantages of virosomal and proteoliposomal vaccine formulations, I tend to conclude that proteoliposomes represent the most promising RSV vaccine candidate, particularly since proteoliposomes provide the ability to control the amount of the viral preF on the surface of the particle. Hopefully, an effective RSV vaccine for the high-risk groups will soon become available. Chapter 8178 EIGHT[1] Singleton RJ, et al.

The final part of my thesis and, as being guilty myself reading other thesis's, pro - bably the only part most of you will read. It is a shame, since I devoted almost five years of my life working hard and spending late hours of writing to complete all chapters. Maybe you could take the time and scan at least through the other chapters. My name is the only one printed on the books cover, but this book wouldn't have been there if I wouldn't have gotten all the help of some great people. First of all I would like to thank Jan, Toon and Aalzen, my supervisors that guided me through this unusual four years. I think you all agree with me, that this journey was dif-ferent than other PhD projects, mainly because I am the very first 2+2 sandwich student doing a joined PhD project between academic (UMCG) and industrial research (Mymetics BV). It was challenging to balance the interest of a company with the interest of the uni-versity. But you all got my back, no matter the situation. I felt special, having a professor that can dedicate his full attention to his PhD student with our weekly meetings. Jan , you truly taught me how to write a manuscript, starting with a detailed summary. Thank you for all your time you dedicated to do that. You know that I struggled with that part, and looking back I can say that your patience helped a lot. Toon, many thanks for your guidance through my first two years at Mymetics BV. You have a different view on how to design experiments compared to Jan, Aalzen and me, the view from a company perspec - tive. This was inspiring and helped to have an equilibrium in \"academia\" and \"company\" experiments. Some experiments might not seem important from a scientific point of view but are crucial in vaccine development with the aim for FDA approval. Aalzen, I am so glad that you agreed on supervising me for the last two years of my PhD. I want to thank you for your significant contribution for the immunological part, since my first two years at Mymetics were mostly focused on vaccine design and stability. Your knowledge about immunology is enormously and helped a lot with your view on analyzing data. Especially when my conclusion was a bit too short. Lastly, I would like to thank Anke . Joining the Flu- group wasn't initially the plan but many thanks for \"adopting\" me. I truly enjoyed being part of the Flu-group, even though I wasn't working with Influenza. I am thankful that I was able to learn more about Influenza and in return I taught the Flu-group something about RSV. Thank you for your suggestions and comments for my General Introduction and Discussion. I would like to thank the \"triple B\" reading committee Prof. dr. L.J. Bont, Prof. dr. N.A. Bos and Prof. dr. J.F. van den Bosch for their time to read and evaluate my thesis and supply - ing their contributions to finalize this book.Acknowledgements201 200 Many thanks to the Mymetics team: Farien, sant atmosphere to work at Mymetics in Leiden. You all were involved in the RSV virosome studies and with your help we accomplished a lot. Thank you Ronald Kempers, to give me the opportunity to have this extraordinary PhD project - a 2+2 sandwich PhD. Thank you, Barney Graham, for giving me the opportunity to come to your lab at the VRC/NIH for a 5 month research project. The experiments resulted in an additional chapter of this thesis. Of course, I was not able to do all this research alone. Many thanks to the T-cell group: Tracy , Emily, Deepika and Erez. Especially for coming to the lab at 6am to harvest the LN and lungs of the mice. Many thanks to Kayvon, since he was the person that helped me to get in contact with Barney and introduced me to him. Thanks to the rest of the Graham lab, you all helped me in making my time at the VRC both productive and enjoyable and I feel honored that I am now part of the Graham lab. Jolanda S., Toos and Iza, thanks for all your inspiring questions during my work discussi- on presentations and literature meetings. Jolanda O., you're the heart of the Molecular Vi- rology department in Groningen. I don't know what we would do without you. Thanks for all your administrative help during and after my PhD. The technicians in our lab: Jacque- line, Marijke, Denise, Annemarie, Heidi and Baukje Nynke. You were always willing to help with a technical/protocol question. Many thanks for that! Tjarko, thank you for all hard work and help with the animal experiments! Many thanks to my office mates: Pepe (the master of the Crane Origami), Mariana (sorry Mariana, I tried to keep your plants alive), Dong Wei (the quiet one among all of us in our office), Ellen (my lunch or coffee partner), Federica (you will do just fine, don't worry), Vinit (please watch out with the Liquid Nitrogen) and Elias (the newbie when I was about to leave, your Dutch improved a lot!). Something was always happening in our office, starting with the quote of the week in Dutch, English and Spanish, the \"wish-list\" for Secret Santa, the Puzzle we were not all-owed to finish or our Dutch/Spanish-Fridays (which didn't really go as planned). I would also like to thank the other PhD students (and one Postdoc) that worked or are still at the Virology department: Lili, Gabi, John, Stephanie and Beto . I was so nervous when I joined the lab in Groningen, not knowing if I would be able to find my place in the group. The atmo - sphere in this lab is really special and that resulted in friendships and lots of outside-work activities. Thank you all for the great 2 years at the lab. Steph , the person that always had time for a quick coffee and definitely willing to have Su- shi with me for dinner, lunch or breakfast. Thank you for the two fun years at the lab. I just love your enthusiasm about every little exciting thing. Don't change! Who knows, maybe we see each other again working together in the US.Acknowledgements201 200 Ruben, you were my student for a whole year. Actually the only student I supervised du- ring my PhD. I am so sorry that we had to do our weekly meetings with a 6 hour time dif-ference at the end. I know it wasn't easy for you but you did well! You managed to design and perform your experiments by yourself (except for the few calls at 3am in the morning ;-) ). I hope you learned a lot and I wish you all the best for your future career. John, I am so glad that our paths crossed. They say that you meet your friends for life when you're young but I am sure we will prove them differently. It is just a bit more challenging to catch up nowadays, since we're not in the same city anymore. Thank you for all our gre - at conversations about the meaning of life, science or music. So happy that we went to see Radiohead in Berlin. Just a great trip and another special memory to keep. Berit and Ellen, my two paranymphs. Thank you so much for taking care of everything. Be - rit, I know that you thought in the beginning that I didn't like you. To be honest I thought, \"Ugh another stupid German\" . (I tried to avoid meeting Germans during the 10 years that I lived in The Netherlands). But obviously you're not another stupid German! Thank you for always having each other's backs. I actually really enjoyed talking to you in German. Thanks for correcting my German Summary - it was so difficult to write (a native speaking person, so sad). You're a great personality and I'm sure you will do just great for the next two years of your PhD. (Oh and thanks for introducing me to rock climbing - I love it!) Ellen, the youngest in our lab. I love your happy and positive character. Thank you for all your support and help. You were my lunch and coffee break buddy, hope you're still eating a whole cucumber for lunch, LOL. I know that you will do just fine with your PhD, I wish you all the best for your last phase. You girls rock! I miss having you both around me :-( Tobias, everything is all your fault ;-) You were a major part that helped me to decide that I want to work in vaccine development. I was your student for a year, working on RSV viro - somes and if I remember correctly the reason that you had to show up at work at 9am for a whole year. We stayed in contact and our paths crossed again when I moved to The Hague for my first 2 years of my PhD. Funny enough, you lived just down the street in The Hague and accused me of stalking you. Thanks for our awesome morning ritual: taking the train together and having an espresso at Lebkov. I already knew form the very beginning of my PhD that I would like to have you as my paranymph, thank you for doing this. ***Acknowledgements202 It won't be surprising for all of you that in those almost 5 years, working on my PhD wasn't the only thing I did. There are so many people that I would like to thank outside work that had a positive influence during my PhD. My apologies if I forgot anyone...My dearest Alien's - no names needed for that. Our friendship started during our Master's degree. Thanks for the awesome trips to Slovenia, Barcelona, Amsterdam, Wageningen and even London (I know, London wasn't during my PhD). You guys are just great! The balance of awkwardness, nerdy talks about science, jokes, complaining about our projects and suppor - ting each other was and is just great! Some of us have entered the \"burgerlijke leven\" , gotten old or don't have a life - just the usual. Looking forward to enter the same phase ;-). I lived in The Hague during the first two years of my PhD and met many new friends there. Thanks, PH9 Chica's for a wonderful time in the most beautiful street in The Hague. At the start of my PhD I didn't know anyone in The Hague, so I decided to start playing the most social sport - field hockey. Obviously, in no time my circle of friends exploded. Mara, it was great that you joined me to South America for a conference. I will never forget our adven-ture in Argentina and Chile. Hanneke, Michael, David, Sleo and Bas thank you for your friendship and support. You all had always time for a talk, a beer, a running session, a hockey session, the third half during hockey, a festival or helping me moving. Of course everyone else at Groen-Geel, thanks for the wonderful time there, you all helped me to balance my life with lots of hockey, beers, coffees and parties. Marnix, we shared our apartment for two years at the most perfect spot in Groningen, de Vismarkt. I truly enjoyed living with you together, you are the best roommate I've ever had. Thank you for the great moments of having dinner together, talking about your workday at school, or watching a documentary together. I do have to admit that I am not missing your friends that wake me up in the middle of the night just to tell me how happy they are to see me. Kiran, my eating-partner in crime, our friendship started at a bar in Chinatown in Penang, Malaysia. We both love good food and coffee, which we figured on Langkawi. Such a shame that we weren't able to finish our restaurant-bucket-list in Groningen. Richard, Jacco and Martijn, also many thanks to your friendships, support, and obviously helping me moving. It was great to come back to Groningen after 4 years and seeing you more often again. Annelies and Esther, you also belong to this group. During our Bachelor, people could get us only in a triple package. Every time we saw each other, the first question I got was \"Hoe staat het me de mannen\" and the second one (just to be polite) \"Hoe gaat het met je onderzoek\" . Esther, you still owe Anne and me a weekend trip - remember...Thank you both for your friendship and I hope this distance won't change anything.Acknowledgements203 Meine Familie h\u00e4ufig sehe. And last, but not least I would like to thank the person that was there for me the most I've ever needed someone in my life. I went to the States, steadfast to focus on my PhD and to finish up my experiments. But then I met you, Ryan . I felt for you the first moment we met. You are the most wonderful person I have ever met, and I feel so lucky to be your girlfriend. Thank you for being patient, dealing with my ups and downs or mood swings during my final writing phase and especially able to handle me when I am hangry. Thank you for all your love and support during and after my PhD. I can't believe that I spend 10 years of my life in The Netherlands. You all know that I am a nomad and haven't stayed longer than 2 years in an apartment or even a city. (I should thank my Dad for helping me moving ALL the time). My next big chapter has already started and who knows how long I will stay in Washington DC. All in all, I have a lot to be grateful for. I feel honoured and blessed to be surrounded by so many great people. I hope we stay in touch and you are always welcome for a visit in Washington DC (or wherever my future will take me). Big hugs and thank you all! 205Curriculum vitae205 Curriculum vitae personal information Name Julia Lederhofer Date and place of birth 2nd February 1985, Langenfeld, Germany E-mail address Julia.Lederhofer@gmail.com Work experience February 2018-current Postdoc, VPL Translational Science Core (VPTS) Vaccine Research Center (VRC) National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID)National Institute of Health (NIH)Bethesda, MD, United States Education Oct 2013-Dec 2017 PhD, 2+2 Sandwich, Molecular Virology Department of Medical Microbiology University Medical Center Groningen (UMCG)Mymetics BV., Leiden Sep 2011-Aug 2013 and Research (WUR) Dec 2008-July 2011 BSc, Biology and Medical Laboratory Research Hanze University of Applied Sciences, GroningenPublications206 publications 1.
