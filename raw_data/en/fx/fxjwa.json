It can relieve chemotherapy-related or surgery-related nausea and vomiting, headaches, neck and back pain, arthritis, and other discomforts. Our licensed acupuncture provider will assess you and customize your treatment to meet your needs. STRESS MANAGEMENT At the foundation of mind-body techniques, breathing is the key to balancing the nervous system. Studies show that diaphragmatic breathing lowers blood pressure, reduces cortisol levels, reduces anxiety and depression, and improves mood and immune function. Stress management workshops are available to teach you how to relax and find empowerment within yourself. REIKI Reiki is a Japanese technique that is used to reduce stress and promote relaxation and healing through a gentle laying of hands.Services Offered 4 NUTRITIONAL COUNSELING Our registered dietitian and holistic nutritionist are available to help you learn how a healthy diet can support you during treatment for cancer or other conditions. If you're not in treatment, we can evaluate your diet and work with you to eat in ways that support your health and energy. WELLNESS COACHING What is most important to you? What is your vision of where you want to be, and how will your life improve when you get there? What are your obstacles and strengths? Your coach is available for one-on-one consultations to help you learn what you can do to feel better, figure out your goals, and begin your journey to wellness. INTEGRATIVE AND FUNCTIONAL MEDICAL CONSULTATIONS Integrative and functional medical consultations aim to identify underlying causes of illness rather than just managing the symptoms. These medical consultations are a different approach to looking at the whole person in an in-depth way, considering dietary and family history, environmental and lifestyle factors, interpersonal relationships, as well as stressors at home or work. Our medical director will spend time with you to learn about your history and develop an individualized care plan made in consultation with your primary care doctor. *Medical consultations are typically covered by insurance. Check with your plan for coverage opportunities. 5 YOGA The word yoga means \"union.\" Designed for all levels, our yoga classes unite body, mind, and spirit through gentle poses, breathing, and imagery. Our offerings include classes that will concentrate on alleviating pain, reducing stress, or promoting overall wellbeing. Come practice with us and learn how yoga can help you relax, refocus, and reconnect.
