During the first fifteen years , the nursing programs became so varied, the enrollment so large, and the contribution to the total community so important t hat reorganization was necessary. In 1944, at the request of the College of Liberal Arts, the Board of Education authorized the establishment of the Wayne University College of Nursing. The College began to function as one of the components of the Universi ty in the spring of 1945. In 1947 under the leadership of Kath arine Faville, the College's first dean, the faculty assumed full responsibility for teaching clinical nursing courses. This was the first time the shifting of clinical teaching from hospital st aff to nursing faculty was initiated. This model has now been incorporated by colleges and schools of nursing nationwide . Graduates from the program were eligible to take the Michigan examination for the registered nurse license. Since 1945, the College ha s offered programs leading to the degree of Master of Science in Nursing. These programs offer advanced practice preparation for nurse practitioners and clinical nurse specialists. In 1975, the College developed a Doctor of Philosophy in Nursing. In 2008, the College established the Doctorate in Nursing Practice. Philosophy The College of Nursing functions within the context of Wayne State University and supports the central goals and mission of the University. These goals are to nurture the intellectual abilities of students and faculty and to provide education, research, and community service. As an urban university, Wayne State accepts responsibility for a reciprocal partnership with the community, using resources and knowledge in dealing with urban life. Nursing is an academic discipline and profession. As a discipline, nursing develops its body of knowledge using research as the major mode of discovery and validation. The schol arly environment of the university enhances the research and theory development endeavors of the College of Nursing. As a profession, nursing uses knowledge creatively in response to the health care needs of society. Experience in a variety of clinical set tings is the primary mode for the development of practice competencies. The urban context of the University provides a setting for exploring the application of knowledge to professional nursing practice. The concepts that order the discipline and professio n of nursing are derived from knowledge about human beings, health care, and environment. These concepts give identity to professional nursing practice, direct inquiry, and theory development. The College of Nursing supports the importance of liberal arts, humanities, and sciences. Faculty believes that programs designed for the preparation of nurses must be composed of the intellectual, social, and technical components of a liberal and professional education that are available to students within an institu tion of higher learning. Faculty affirms the necessity and value of clinical practice within a professional nursing program. OVERVIEW ii The faculty believes that learners are self -directed and actively participate in the learning process. Self-direction encourages th e development of personal goals and values significant to the profession of nursing. Knowledge acquisition, capacity for critical inquiry, reflection and decision making prepare learners to respond to issues that confront them as professionals. Learners fr om diverse backgrounds enter the College of Nursing to begin or continue their education within the academic discipline of nursing. Faculty believes that the diverse characteristics of its students add to the richness of the learning experience. The progra m seeks to accommodate the special needs, interests, and abilities of the students. The faculty supports the right of students to question, challenge, and debate within the context of inquiry as an essential ingredient in the students' development. Continu ing evaluation on the part of students and faculty is essential to sustain the integrity of the program. The faculty of the College of Nursing, as members of the academic community, recognizes that its professional functions extend beyond contributions to formal teaching. Research, practice, and community service are also expectations of the faculty role. The faculty views as essential academic freedom, shared governance, opportunity to develop knowledge, and responsibility to incorporate new knowledge into teaching and nursing practice. The faculty assumes responsibility for enhancing the image of the College of Nursing and the University locally , nationally, and internationally through various avenues including research, scholarship, practice, consultation , and participatory decision making. Mission Statement The mission of the College of Nursing is to create and translate knowledge and to educate a diverse student body prepared to excel as clinicians, scholars, and leaders who improve health in local a nd global communities. Vision The College of Nursing will be the leader in nursing research and education, known for our commitment to and impact on urban health. Values As the College of Nursing, we commit to the values of Wayne State University. While ou r vision and mission show where we want to go, our values guide us on the way. Our values bind us culturally and permeate our strategic and tactical initiatives. They are the defining traits of the Wayne State community. Collaboration: When we work togethe r, drawing upon various talents and perspectives, we achieve better results. Integrity: We keep our word, live up to our commitments and are accountable to ourselves and each other. Innovation: We are unafraid to try new things and learn by both failure a nd success. Excellence: We strive for the highest quality outcomes in everything we do. Diversity and Inclusion: We value all people and understand that their unique experiences, talents and perspectives make us a stronger organization and better people.

Students are expected to meet these standards of excellence. The following policies must be adhered to for students to progress toward degree completion. Definition of Terms Professional course means any course required in the professional nursing curriculum. Satisfactory grade means a grade of \"C\" (2.00) or better. Unsatisfactory grade means a grade below \"C\" (2.00), or a mark of \" WF\". Probation means a restricted status in the nursing program Exclusion from the program means that the student may not register in the nursing program. (To continue taking courses at Wayne State University the student must complete a change of college form with Undergraduate Advising .) Scholarsh ip 1. All students must maintain a satisfactory (2.00) honor point average (h.p.a) in both (a) cumulative grades (general education and nursing); and (b) professional courses. 2. A grade below \"C\" (2.00) in a professional nursing course is unsatisfactory for progression. Students must achieve a 2.00 g.p.a. in each professional nursing course. A student may not continue in subsequent courses for which the failed course is a prerequi site until a minimum of 2.00 has been achieved. NUR 2010, 2030, 2060, and 2995 are pre (or co) requisites for 2050 . NUR 2050 is a pre (or co) requisite for a ll other clinical based courses. NUR 3010 and 3020 are prerequisites for NUR 4050 There are no other absolute stops (i.e. could fail NUR 3010 and take NUR 3020) 3. Traditional students are able to take courses offered to the CD2 students based on available space in the courses. For example, NUR 4010 and NUR 4020 are offered in the summer for the CD2 students but a traditional student can elect to take these courses i n the summer if a slot is available. Likewise, a traditional student c an elect to retake a failed course with a class of predominantly CD2 studen ts if a slot is available. If there are more applicants than available spots, a lottery w ill be held to fill available spaces. 4. Students may apply to repeat a nursing course only once to raise the grade to the 2.00 level or above. 5. A maximum of one nursing course w ithin the program may be repeated. 6. No nursing course for which a student has received a passing grade may be repeated without written approval of the Associate Dean for Academic and Clinical Affairs. 2 7. A student receiving a \"C -\" (1.67) grade or less in either the theory or the clinical portion of any nursing course will have recorded no higher than a \"C -\" (1.67) for the total course and will be required to successfully complete the re -entry process to re peat the course before progressing to the next clinical course. 8. The mark of \"I\" is appropriate if the student encounters a catastrophic situation which prevents completion of the final requirements of a course. The mark of \"I\" is not appropriate for un satisfactory scholastic performance. In the event a mark of \"I\" is given, the time limit for comple tion will be determined by the instructor, but may not exceed one year. In the event the mark of \"I\" is received for a prerequisite course, the \"I\" must be removed prior to enrollment in the subsequent course. After one year, if the incomplete is not completed , the grade will automatically change to an \"F\" (failure) and be treated as a failing grade. Probation Probation status is a warning to a student to improve his/her academic performance in order to remain in the program. 1. A student is placed on professional probation if he/she does not maintain a minimum grade point average of 2.00 in professional nursing courses. 2. The professional nursing course grade must be returned to a minimum of 2.00 to remove probationary status. Probationary status must be removed within one calendar year; and students on probation are not eligible to represent the College in any student activity. Exclusion A student wi ll be excluded from the College if any of the following conditions occur: 1. Failure to satisfactorily complete a nursing course after two attempts; 2. Failure of more than one professional nursing course ; 3. Failure to remove probationary status within one calendar year; 4. Failure to meet any special conditions required by the College Scholastic Policy and Admissions (SPA) Committee for the student's continuation in the program . 5. Failure to complete the program within the time limitations outlined in the sections that follow , unless granted an extension by the SPA Committee. 6. Unsafe or unprofessional behavior. (See policy on page 34. ) 3 Appeal Rights Any student who has been excluded from the College of Nursing due to one of the foregoing reasons has a right to appeal that exclusion pursuant to the same procedures that are set forth in the Academic Appeals process. Attendance Regular punctual attendance in classes and clinical pract ice is expected. Students should notify the instructor if they are unable to attend class or clinical. It is imperative that students maintain a perfect or near -perfect attendance record. Tardiness and/or failure to report to class can result in a lowering of the final course grade or exclusion from the course. Students who feel that their absence is related to extenuating circumstances must discuss this with the faculty of record for the course . If students have a medical issue, they are not required to re veal medical information, however, they may be asked to provide a doctor's note indicating the necessity of the absence. First Day of Class Due to the nature of clinical courses and time requirements, first day class attend ance is MANDATORY. Unexcused absences from the first day of any course may result in an administrative withdrawal for the student for that class and could delay progression in the program. If a student is removed from a class for non -attendance, clinical space in the subsequ ent class offering is not guaranteed. Travel Requirements It is the responsibility of the student to make all travel arrangements necessary to complete degree requirements. This includes travel arrangements required by clinical agencies. Examinations Final Examinations Final examinations for courses ar e offered on two occasions only; the day the University sets as the final, and usually the Wednesday immediately following the final. The College will make no other arrangements for fin al examinations. I f a student misses both of the examinations due to circumstances covered by the Special Circumstances Rule, an incomplete (I) grade for the course will be given . The student will have 12 -months to convert the I -grade into a passing grade (A to C). If the c ourse is a clinical, the College will make every effort to enable the student to take the next offering of the course, subject to availability. However, the College makes no guarantees when a place will become available. Other Examinations or Assessments (e.g. Mid -terms) The regulations for other examinations will be specified in the course syllabus. However, the regulations for notifying the College of missing an examination and the need to fulfill the Special Circumstances Rule to take a make -up examination will still apply. 4 Evolve Lear ning System The Evolve Learning System is an educational software package that is integrate d into the Nursing curriculum. It consists of tutorials, reviews, and nursing specialty assessments that will be included in certain courses. In the event that required Evolve assessments are not completed as required in the syllabi, the student will receive an incomplete (I) grade for that assignment/course unless stated otherwise in the c ourse syllabus . The student will have 12 - months to convert the I -grade into a passing grad e (A to C). While carrying an I -grade the student will not be permitted to progress in their studies. Missing an Examination It is the students' responsibility to contact the faculty of record within 24 hours of the scheduled exam. Eligibility for Make -Up Examinations Students are not automatically entitled to sit for the make -up examination. To be eligible, the student must have contacted the faculty of record within the specified timeframe and the reason for missing the examination should be listed (b elow) as a Special Circumstances rule. The date and time of the make -up examination will be established by the College of Nursing and/or the faculty of record. Special Circumstances The list below outlines the circumstances that qualify as a \"Special Circumstance \" for the purposes of missing examinations: Student is ill on the day of the examination or receiving health treatment Death in student's immediate family Jury Duty or Court Summons Incarceration Military Service Natural Disasters Appropriate documentation (see below) must be provided in order to sit for the make -up examination. Documentation of Special Circumstances Students must supply appropriate original documentation to support their request for permission to take the make -up examination. Documents can include: Provider note Court notice of summons Jury duty notification Death Certificates Documents must be presented to faculty within 48 hours of missing the examination. 5 Residency Requirement The last 30 credits of the Bachelor of Science in Nursing must be taken at Wayne State University. Graduation with Distinction A candidate eligible for the bachelor's degree may receive a special diploma with Magna Cum Laude , or Summa Cum Laude or Cum Laude as indicated. For the University guidelines regarding these distinctions, see the Undergraduate Bulletin. Dean's List and Honors List Students completing twelve semesters credits in study at Wayne State University are eligible for appointment to the Dean's List each semester. The semester grade point average at Wayne State must be 3.75 or above in order to qualify for the Dean's List, or a 4.0 g.p.a. for stud ents registered for six to 11 credits. Lists of students on the Dean's List will be posted in the College of Nursing. Students who receive marks of \"I\" or \"WF\" and grades of \"N\" or \"U\" are not eligible. Students Rights and Responsibilities Continuance in the College is contingent upon compliance with officials' rules, regulations, requirements, and procedure s of the University and the Colle ge of Nursing. The student is responsible for reading th e contents of this handbook, the Undergraduate Bulletin pert inent to the College of Nursing, and the Student Code of Conduct, which discusses all forms of academic and non-academic misconduct for which discipline may be imposed. The Student Code of Conduct is set forth in full at the end of this handbook. Students must fulfill all courses and degree requirements i n proper sequence with satisfactory scholarship. In case of doubt regarding any matter affecting his or her standing as a student, the student should consult with his/her adviso r. The faculty reserves the right to amend or revise the policies and requirements set forth in the College of Nursing. A student may b e excluded from the College when, in the academic j udgment of the faculty, the student's professional behavior demonstrates that the st udent is unsuited for nursing (s ee Exclusion, page 2 ) (See \"Professional Conduct\" under E ssential Requirements section .) Also r efer to Student Rights and Responsibilities for the University in the Undergraduate Bulletin. Time Limitation The Traditional Program must be completed within four calendar years of admission to professional course work, unless an extension is g ranted by the Scholastic Policy and Admissions (SPA) Committee. The Second Career/Second Degree Program must be completed within five consecutive semesters following admission to the program. 6 All students whose progress is delayed by reason of academic failure and/or leaves of absence beyond the time limitation for the program may be required to repeat and/or take additional courses in order to assure graduation with appropriate preparation for current professional nursing practice. Such determination wi ll be made by the SPA Committee. Authorized Leave of Absence A student may request an Authorized Leave of Absence when personal circumstances interfere with the student's ability to devote sufficient time to academic pursuits to assure a reasonable expec tation of success. Authorized Leaves of Absences are requested from and granted by the Associate Dean for Academic and Clinical Affairs, in consultation with the Director of Undergraduate Education and the SPA Committee. 1. Currently enrolled stude nts will be granted a Leave of Absence only if they are passing all nursing courses at 75% or better and are therefore eligible for Withdrawal Passing (WP) grades. 2. The student considering a request for an authorized Leave of Absence should contact the Office of Stu dent Affairs for an explanation of the process regarding the leave of absence and to determine if she or he is eligible. 3. A Leave of Absence is approved for a maximum of one year. A student who receives an authorized Leave of Absence and returns before the Leave of Absence expires is guaranteed a space in the program. An authorized Leave of Absence is not considered a withdrawal from the program. 4. A student who does not re -enter the program by the end of the authorized period will be considered a voluntary withdrawal. 5. A student who withdraws from the nursing program for any reason must reapply to the College of Nursing as a new applicant. A student who takes an unauthorized lea ve of absence will be considered to have voluntarily withdrawn from the program and must apply for admission to the College of Nursing as a new applicant. 6. A grade of Withdrawal Pass (WP) is not the same as an authorized leave of absence. Mark of \"I\" - Incomplete 1. \"The mark of I' (Incomplete) is given to an undergraduate student when he/she has not completed all of the course work as planned for the term and when there is, in the judgment of the instructor, a rea sonable probability that the student will comp lete the course suc cessfully without again attending regular class sessions. The student should be passing at the time the grade of I is given. A written con tract specifying the work to be completed should be signed by the student and instructor. Respons ibility for completing all course work rests with the student. 2. The mark of I' will be changed to a letter grade when the student completes the course work as arranged with the instructor or, if the instructor has left the University, with the Chairperson o f the depart ment or other instructional unit. Work must be completed within one calendar year. There are NO extensions. 7 3. The mark of I' will not be awarded if, in the instructor's judgment, it is necessary for the student to attend subsequent sessions of t he class. If regular attendance is necessary to complete coursework, the stu dent must register for the class for the semester in which attendance is planned. The student will be assessed tuition and applicable fees for the second registration. If the stud ent decides to register for the course, subsequent to the assignment of an I', then the mark of I' for the original election will be changed to a Withdrawal/Passing (WP'), and the student will be responsible for tuition and applicable fees for the second r egistration. Students are responsible for notifying their department and the department offering the course that they have reregistered for the course so that the I' is not changed to an F.' 4. Any unchanged mark of I' will, within one calendar year from the time it was received, be changed to a grade of F for failure. This will not be changed after the I' is replaced. Withdrawal From Nursing Courses A student requesting a withdrawal will be assigned a Withdrawal Passing (WP), Withdrawal Failing (WF), or Withdrawal Non -Attendance (WN ). A WF reflects the same grade as a failure in the College of Nursing. A student is excluded if s/he has a failure or a WF in more than one nursing course (i.e., any NUR course). After the fourth week of the course, the instructor should notify the Assistant Dean, Enrollment and Student Services and the Associate Dean for Academic and Clinical Affairs of the withdrawal. Students must show diligence and are normally ex pected to complete the courses they elect. Irresponsible attendance is wasteful of both student and University resources. Students who consistently receive exce ssive Incompletes and Withdrawals may be refused the privilege of further registration by the Dean or Dean's designee of the C ollege. Students experiencing attendance difficulties should seek counseling from appropriate college or university offices. Grading Scale - Undergraduate Letter Grade Percentage Honor Points A 94% - 100% E 61% and below 0.00 8 Re-Entry Into the College of Nursing after first failure Any failure will affect the student's plan of work and projected graduation date. An override for registration will not be granted until the student has met with their College of Nursing Academic Services Officer and has completed the Undergraduate Academi c Advising for Course Failure form and a revised Plan of Work is completed . Both documents must be signed by the student, their Academic Services Officer and the Assistant Dean, Enrollment and Student Services Readmission after an Absence of More Than One Academic Year Nursing students whose attendance in the nursing curriculum has been interrupted for more than one academic year, unless an exception to the leave policy has been granted by the Scholastic Policy and Admissions (SPA) Committee, must apply fo r readmission to the College of Nursing. Students must apply for readmission at least one full semester prior to the desired term of readmission. Applications for readmission must be reviewed by the SPA Committee. Readmission decisions are based on the stu dent's academic record with consideration given to grades in prerequisite and nursing courses, length of time of absence from the program, and potential for successful completion of the program. Readmission into the College of Nursing and the student's ori ginal program option (Traditional or Second Career/Second degree) is not guaranteed. Readmission decisions may include competency based testing and/or completion of a written exam related to course content. Readmission into the College of Nursing will not occur until approved by SPA and the student has met with their CON ASO and completed a revised Plan of Work. Both documents must be signed by the student, their academic advisor and the Assistant Dea n, Enrollment and Student Services. Senior Year Audit All students should meet with their advisor in the Office of Student Affairs in the semester prior to senior year for a degree audit to ensure compliance with all requirements in preparation for graduation. Failure to do so may result in a delay in awarding of the degree. It is the responsibility of the student to meet and satisfy all University, College and program requirements. Before graduating you must complete an Application for Degree. This form is available on WSU Pipeline and must be submitted no late r than the fourth week of classes in the term in which you expect to graduate. See www.commencement.wayne.edu/ graduation .php for instructions. Licensure Preparation All students entering the undergraduate program in Fall 2002 and thereafter (who are not already RNs) are required to complete nationally normed tests throughout their undergraduate program of study. Individual course syllabi will indicate how this requirement is applied and what part of the course grade will be assigned to these tests. Successful completion of these course requirements is integral to successfully passing the courses. See HESI Section in the handbook for more information. A satisfactory score is dictated by the comprehensive exam used and will be identified prior to the beginning of the semester in which the exam takes place. Each graduating student (who is not 9 already a licensed RN) must also complete an approved NCLEX Review course in preparation for the NCLEX licensure examination as part of the program requirements. All program requirements must be met before a student can be certified as completing their degree requirements with the State of Michigan Licensing Board. In order to begin a professional nursing career, successful writing of th e National Council Licensure Examination for Registered Nurses (NCLEX -RN) is required. The NCLEX -RN is administered by state boards of nursing as part of the process used to determine whether registered nurse candidates meet licensure requirements. The exa mination is developed by the National Council of State Boards of Nursing to measure a candidate's ability to practice safely and effectively as a registered nurse in an entry -level position. It is designed to test the practical application of knowledge and skills in health care situations that occur frequently in entry -level nursing practice. Graduates must satisfactorily complete the licensing examination before practicing as professional registered nurses (RNs). Student Consent to Recording Classes may be recorded by the College of Nursing for purposes including, but not limited to, online section viewing, video pod casting to students enrolled in the course for review, student illness, and absences associated with religious holidays and disability a ccommodations. Class recordings will be available to students through their password protected Blackboard site. Recording devices are prohibited in the classroom except with the instructor's permission. HESI Exit Exam NUR 4060 is an integration of knowledge of ethics, standards, and expectations of professional nursing roles with an emphasis on critical thinking, and contains the HESI Exit Exam, the comprehensive exam required for graduation. Prior to graduation, studen ts are evaluated based on a combination of case studies, quizzes and practice ex ams, as well as their score on the HESI Exit Exam. This exam is heavily weighted in the overall course grade based on its ability to predict success on NCLEX. Students are a llowed three attempts at successfully achieving a passing score on the HESI Exit Exam. The costs associated with the first two attempts are included in the students' fees and there is no additional charge. However, if a third exam is required, any and all costs associated with the third exam are the student's responsibility. Students who are unsuccessful after the third exam in achieving a minimum course grade of 900 on the H ESI Exit exam will receive an \"I ncomplete\" until the fourth attempt is completed. If the student still fails to achieve a score of 900 on the HESI Exit exam, the student will receive a grade of \"C\" in NUR 4060 and counseled as to the possible implications of the score on successful completion of the NCLEX exam. 10 CURRICULAR DESIGNS BSN for Freshmen Pathway The following curriculum outlines the requirements for the Bachelor of Science in Nursing - Freshmen pathway. Students must achieve a \" C\" or higher in all prerequisite courses .

Students who do not provide their Health Certification, documentation of vaccines and eviden ce of immunity, and other requirements by the deadline will not be allowed to attend any clinical site (including on -campus labs) and will be dropped from clinical courses. Late paperwork will result in a clinical absence penalty. These requirements must be met prior to the start of the clinical experience. Documentation of compliance with these requirements must be u ploaded to CastleBranch -Immunization Tracker by August 15 for Fall enrollment . Students can access Immunization Tracker online at www.portal.castlebranch.com/WL48 . Students who have met all of the requirements will be cleared for clinical and clearance will be transmitted to clinical sites. Students who do not meet requirements will be reported to the Director of the Undergraduate Program. Failure to begin the clinical experi ence as scheduled can compromise the student's ability to succeed in the course. Policy: Students will incur a one clinical absence for every week passed the established deadline (see Clinical Attendance Policy). Students will not be allowed to start clin icals until faculty and students receive a clearance and start date from the Director of Undergraduate Program s. Students are not allowed to attend clinical without a valid Clinical Permit. Requirements ACE Students must complete the requirements for AC E, the Alliance for the Clinical Experience. Requirements include successful completion of on -line classes and exams in HIPAA, OSHA, and BBP. Students must pass the exams within the two attempts or they may not be eligible to enter clinical courses (they may not be able to enter the program or progress in the program). Health Clearance Form The examination may be completed by the student's nurse practitioner or physician. The TB skin test must be in effect for the entire academic year. Evidence of immunity are required for Tdap, measles, mumps, rubella, varicella, Hepatitis B and influenza. Students must provide copies of the laboratory reports for all antibody titers.

Professional Liability Insurance Wayne State University College of Nursing will provide professional liability insurance through Nursing Practice Corporation, at a cost of $13 .38 per student. Students must purchase the liability insurance online at www.nursing.wayne.edu. 17 Health Insurance Though not required, it is highly recommended by the College that each student also have personal health insurance coverage in addition to the required liability insurance. Students may choose to purchase an injury and sickness insurance plan for a reasonable fee. The policy provides stipulated amounts for outpatient prescription drugs (sickness only), hospitalization, surgery and emergency room fees, alcoholism and drug abus e treatment, and psychotherapy benefits. Forms to purchase this insurance are available by contacting the Health Insurance Advocate in the Office of International Students and Scholars: 313 -577-0724. Criminal Background Investigation According to Public H ealth Code Section 20173 and Section 21173(1), any individual who regularly provides direct services to patients and residents in nursing home s, count y medical facilities, homes for the aged and adult foster care cannot be granted clinical privileges if th ey have been convicted of one or more of the following: a) A felony or an attempt or conspiracy to commit a felony within the 15 years preceding the date of application. b) A misdemeanor involving abuse, neglect, assault, battery, or criminal sexual condu ct or involving fraud or theft against a vulnerable adult defined in the Michigan penal code, 1931 PA 328, MCL 750.145m, or a state or federal crime that is substantially similar to a Misdemeanor described in this subdi vision within 10 years immediately preceding the date of application. This legislation as well as regulatory agenc y requirements mandates that students have a criminal history check conducted in order to gain clinical privileges at the various agencies used d uring the course of the student's education . Exclusion from a clinical site could jeopardize successful completion of the program. Students must have a criminal background check performed by CertifiedBackground.com. Urine Drug Screen Testing In addition to the Criminal Bac kground Investigation, many health care agencies require results of a urine drug screen test (negative result) prior to the beginning of your clinical experience. This should be obtained at the Wayne State University Campus Health Center . The screen must include use of medical marijuana will provide a positive result on a urine drug screen. Students with a Medical Marijuana Registry Identification Card will be required to submit a valid copy to the Office of Student Affairs. Wayne State University College of N ursing's clinical partners may exclude a student with a positive drug screen from attending clinical courses at their site, which could jeopardize the successful completion of the program. Results of the Urine Drug Screen test must be submitted and will become part of your health information file. Influenza Vaccination Proof of influenza vaccination must be uploaded to your CastleBranch -Immunization Tracker by October 15. 18 Check List for Clinical Requirements Must be valid for academic year Date Submitted Create Immunization Tracker Account Health Clearance Form with Immunization record TDAP (Tetanus, Diptheria, Pertussis) Measles, Mumps, Rubella, Varicella, (optional) B Virus Inoculation Titers and Vaccination record (required) BLS for the Professional Rescuer (Annual verification) TB Skin Test or documentation of no active TB (Annual verification ) Pay fee for Professional Liability Insurance (Annual verification) Criminal Background Investigation Urine Drug Screen ACE requirements (online modules ) Clinical Attire Uniform Approved nursing attire must be worn during the clinical placement. Scrubs and lab coats must be ordered through the university Barnes & Noble bookstore. Within the health care agency, the student is expected to present a clean, well-groomed appearance. The student represents not only him/herself but the College of Nursing and the nursing profession. Students are expected to use good judgment regarding their professional attire, especially when in Community Health Agencies or as senior students in \"management\" settings. ID Badge All nursing students are required to obtain a College of Nursing photo ID badge from the Office of Student Affairs. Students wear the ID badge while at their clinical site. A lost or stolen badge must be reported to the College of Nursing immediately. Misuse of the ID badge will result in immediate f orfeiture and possible disciplinary action. 19 Clinical Placements Students are assigned clinical placements by OSA . Clinical placements are determined by space availability and academic variables. Clinical A ttendance Policy The need for regular and punctual attendance is one enforced by employers, as well as in all of the Wayne State University College of Nursing programs. It is imperative that students attend all clinical days, regardless of the setting , to develop the neces sary skills to function as a professional registered nurse. However, it is recognized by the faculty that illnesses and other life events do occur. Students must notify their clinical faculty of any absence prior to the beginning of the clinical day, other wise they will be considered a \"no call -no show.\" If a student arrives to clinical with a communicable illness, he/she will not be allowed to participate in patient care and will be sent home. All absences are required to be made up. Exceptions to this policy may only be granted by the Associate Dean of Academic and Clinical Affairs in collaboration with the Director of the Undergraduate Program. Absences The first clinical absence will be made up with no deductions in a student's grade. Within one week of the absence, the student must make arrangements for an agreed on make -up assignment with the course coordinator and clinical faculty. While one option for a makeup assignment is the simulation lab, alternate experiences may also be assigned by the Cour se Coordinator in collaboration with the clinical faculty. Each additional clinical absence will result in a 5% percent reduction in the course grade. In addition to course grade reduction, within one week of the absence, the student must make arrangements for an agreed on make -up assignment with the course coordinator and clinical faculty. If a student misses two clinical days, they will be required to meet with the course coordinator, clinical instructor and his/her OSA advisor to determine hi s/her ability to con tinue in the course. More than two clinical absences place in jeopardy the student's ability to successfully complete the course. \"No-call, No-show\" When a student fails to notify the clinical instructor of an absence prior to the star t of the assigned clinical day, the event will be considered \"no call -no show.\" This will result in 10% reduction in overall course grade and the student will be expected to make up the clinical time. In the event of a second \"no -call-no show\" event, the s tudent will recei ve a grade of \"F\" in the course and will not be allowed to participate in any scheduled clinical experiences. Punctuality Nursing is a profession that requires punctuality. Students are expected to be on time for clinical and all assigne d clinical activities. The student MUST allow time for traffic congestion, parking problems, bad weather, and car trouble. Two separate instances of tardiness of less than or equal to 30 minutes will equate to one absence. A single tardy episode of more th an 30 minutes equeates to an absence even if the student is allowed to remain in the clinical setting. 20 STUDENT INJURY POLICY Enrolled students experiencing an injury or non -personal illness (excludes personal illnesses such as, but not limited to, flu, cold/sinus, etc.) on campus or while attending class or participating in University -sponsored activities shall receive initial treatment at a University -authorized medical facility as noted below: Emergency issues: Detroit Receiving Hospital - ER Henry Ford Hospital - Detroit ER Non-emergency Issues: University Health Center Henry Ford Medical Center - Harbortown Only the initial treatment necessary for an injury or illness requiring immediate attention is covered by this policy.

Any diagnostic testing, prescriptions or subsequent visits are the responsibility of the student. (*) Walk -ins should be no later than 3:00 p.m. for both clinics 21 Bloodborne Pathogen Exposure Plan All students should use extreme caution in the care of their patients to avoid needle sticks and exposure to Bloodborne pathogens. All students will use Universal Precaution in all patient care settings. In the event of a needle s tick or exposure to bloodborne pathogens: Students who are possibly exposed to bloodborne pathogens by way of needle sticks or exposure to human body fluids must report the exposure to their clinical instructor immediately . They should w ash off or flush ou t exposure as soon as possible after it occurs according the guidelines provided by the ACE modules or the clinical agency.\" 1. Exposure during a precepted experience must be reported immediately to the preceptor and as soon as possible to the course faculty member. 2. For students who are possibly exposed to bloodborne pathogens by way of needle sticks or exposure to human body fluids at off -campus sites, such as hospitals or community health settings, the following policy will apply o For exposures in a hospital or another agency with a policy covering possible exposure to bloodborne pathogens, the policy of the facility will be followed. o For exposures in a setting where there is no poli cy on possible exposure to bloodborne pathogens, the student should either report immediately to University Health Center (UHC), 4K (7:30 a.m. -3:30 p.m.*) or Henry Ford Health Center - Harbortown Suite 100 (8:00a.m. -4:30p.m.*) located on Jefferson just west of Belle Isle or to thei r personal health care provider (at your own expense). If the injury occurs after the previously mentioned clinic's operational hour, the student has the option to go to Detroit Receiving or Henry Ford Emergency Room for initial tr eatment. If the agency does not cover the cost of testing for students, students are responsible for the cost of testing beyond the initial treatment for exposure (health insurance may cover): HIV antibody Hepatitis B surface antibody Hepatitis C antibody Testing for Viral Hemorrhagic Fevers (e.g. Ebola and Marburg fevers) Pregnancy test (for women) 22 ESSENTIAL QUALIFICATIONS OF CANDIDATES FOR THE UNDERGRADUATE NURSING PROGRAM The Wayne State University College of Nursing Bachelor of Science in Nursing (both traditional and second degree programs) prepares student to be caring, competent and active participants in an increasingly diverse, complex, and rapidly changing health care environment. The role of a professional nurse requires skills and a bilities in the cognitive, affective, psychomotor, physical, and social arenas and mastery of these skills is essential to becoming a competent member of the health care team. In addition to the standards of academic integrity and overall professional behavior outlined in the Wayne State University College of Nurs ing (WSU CON) Student Handbook and the acceptable academic and nonacademic behavior outlined in the Student Code of Conduct, the candidate for the WSU CON must possess the following abilities. Motor Skills: Although the professional nurse may function in a variety of settings post graduation, in order to successfully complete this program, the candidate must have the ability to care for patients in all health care settings. For example, the candid ate must be able to perform basic life support; provide physical assistance to patients including repositioning, transfers and ambulation; and prepare and administer medications including those requiring the manipulation of syringes, intravenous tubing, an d small pills . Sensory/Observation: The candidate must be able to learn in the classroom, laboratory, and clinical setting using a variety of senses. Changes in a patient's condition is often manifested in physical changes and so the candidate must be abl e, for example, to clearly assess heart and lung sounds, changes in a patient's voice, palpate skin temperature and pulses, and see changes in skin color or other physical characteristics. Communication: The role of the professional nurse requires the abi lity to communicate clearly and effectively, both orally and in the written form, with peers, faculty, patients and their families, and other members of the health care team. This communication is often time sensitive, and so the candidate must possess the ability to communicate accurately and in a timely manner. Cognitive: The use of written information is extensive; therefore, the candidate must be able to quickly read and understand the written word and then integrate and synthesize that information into the clinical setting. He or she must be able to do math calculations needed in the care of patients in all health care settings (for example, calculate the correct dost of medications including intravenous administration). Behavior/Emotional: The WSU CO N program is fast paced and can be stressful. The candidate must possess the ability to work effectively under stress, in a rapidly changing environment, while maintaining mature, empathetic, and effective relationships with peers, faculty, patients, and o ther professionals. 23 Professional Conduct: Nursing is a caring profession governed by the American Nurses Association code of conduct, ethics, and professional standards . . Candidates must be willing to abide by these codes and standards in their provision of care. This includes the ability to provide caring, competent, compassionate, and professional care. Accommodations for Disability: The WSU CON is committed to providing all students equal access to its programs. Only the University's Office of Student Disability Services (SDS) can grant accommodations to a student. The CON works closely with the SDS, but it is the student's responsibility to contact SDS and provide the required information when requesting an accommodation. However, it is important to note that the CON is not required to provide accommodations that fundamentally alter the essential functions or technical standards of the program. The process for obtaining accommodations, i ncluding acquiring the required documentation of the need for accommodations, can be time consuming. Since the accommodations cannot be applied retroactively, students who wish to request accommodations are encouraged to contact the Student Disability Serv ices Office before the actual start of the program. To learn about the process in detail, including expected time frames for completion of the process, please contact Student Disability Services at: 5155 -577-4898 Fax 24 RESOURCES Nursing Skills Laboratory (Rooms 217 & 219 Cohn) The Nursing Skill s Laboratory is a practice lab with simulated hospital bedside units. Students practice various nursing procedures under the guidance of a nursing faculty. Physical Assessment Learning Laboratory (Room 30 Cohn): This laboratory provides materials, activities, and facilities for students to acquire skills in history -taking and physical assessment. The Physical Assessment Learning Laboratory (PALL) is located on the lower level of the Cohn Building. It is equipped with physical exa mination spaces and equipment . Students learn physical examination skills through the use of demonstration, media viewing, and practice. Office of Health Research (Room 315 Cohn): The Office of Health Research (O HR), the research arm of the College of Nur sing, embodies the commitment of faculty to research. The idea of a center originated with faculty in the mid -60's: it became a reality in 1969. It was the first such center in an academic setting devoted to the generation of new knowledge which underpins the discipline and profession of nursing. The research program of the OHR focuses on nursing and health -related research, including interdisciplinary research, for the purpose of advancing nursing knowledge and improving nursing and health (Urban Health a nd Self -Care & Caregiving). Because the research objectives also target health needs of the urban community, the research agenda also advances the research programs of the University. nursing.wayne.edu/faculty/health -research.php Simulation Laboratory (Rooms 217 & 222 Cohn) : The Simulation laboratory contains state -of -the art technology (including high fidelity mannequin simulators and audio -visual real -time capture) to provide the student with an immersive and i nteractive environment wh ich enhances student learning. Students, in conjunction with faculty, are able to practice and blend skills taught in the Nursing Skills Laboratory, Physical Assessment Learning Laboratory and the classroom. Because of the immersive nature of the simulation environment, students are required to behave in a professional manner and wear approved Wayne State University clinical uniforms when in the Simulation Laboratory. 25 FACULTY AND STUDENT RESPONSIBILITIES Since education is a cooperative effort between teacher and student, both parties must fulfill obligations if the integrity and efficacy of the instructional process are to be preserved.

However, from time to time, the Unive rsity is called upon to assist individuals who are displaying disruptive behavior or behavior that shows signs of distress, such as : 1. words or actions that have the effect of intimidating or harassing another; 2. words or actions that threaten harm to themselves or others; Words or actions that severely impair their ability to function within the University environment; To ensure respect for the legal rights of every person, the University will take immediate steps to deal with all instances of disrupt ive or distressed behavior and provide appropriate resources to those involved. All students, including those in distress, are accountable for their actions. The University and the College do not tolerate violent, dangerous or threatening behavior. Such behavior will immediately be reported to the Wayne State Police and to the Dean of Students Office. If a faculty member, staff member or student has a concern about a particular student's disruptive or distressed behavior, they should file a Care report with the Dean of Students Office. The Care report can be accessed at: http://doso.wayne.edu/student -care-report.html For more information, contact the Dean of Student s Office or vis it http://doso.wayne.edu/dealing -with-a-disruptive -student.html 28 COLLEGE OF NURSING ACADEMIC APPEALS POLICY (GRADES AND EXCLUSION) Basic Principles 1. Assistance . Student/faculty may contact the College of Nursing, Assistant Dean, Enrollment and Student Services and/or the Wayne State University Ombudsperson at any time for assistance with any problem associated with a grade decision or grade appeal. 2. Timeliness o f appeals process . Failure of the instructor or any appeal officer to respond within the designated time frame of the formal appeal entitles the student to proceed to the next level of appeal. In no case should there be any assumption that a failure to res pond at any level signifies a granting of the appeal. Failure of the student to adhere to the time -frames specified in the policy will result in the appeal process being nullified (the appeal will not be heard). 3. Process: All steps of the formal grade appeal must be done in written format; no email correspondence is acceptable. Information submitted should be time stamped and dated as it is received. 4. Academic dishonesty . These policy guidelines do not apply to allegations of academic dishonesty. Academic dishonesty matters are addressed under the Student Code of Conduct. . 5. Patient safety . Students may be removed from a clinical course at any time in which the faculty or clinical agency staff identifies an issue that would constitute unsafe practice in the clinical setting that may jeopardize patient safety. Note that \"days\" are counted as Monday through Friday, excluding University holidays. APPEAL OF GRADE What can be appealed: Only the manner in which the grade was assigned can be appealed. Instructors are expected to evaluate student work accordin g to sound academic standards. It is the instructor's prerogative to assign grades in accordance with his/her academic/professional judgment. If the student believes the manner in which the grade w as assigned was done in an unfair manner and the student is able to demonstrate that the unfair manner is based on one of the three criteria stated below , then the student may file an appeal pursuant to the process set forth below. The student assumes the burden of proof in the appeals process . Grounds for appeals are : (1) the application of non -academic criteria in the grading process, as listed in the university's non -discrimination/affirmative action statute: race, color, sex (including 29 gender id entity), national origin, religion, age, sexual orientation, familial status, marital status, height, weight, disability, or veteran status; (2) sexual harassment or discrimination; or (3) evaluation of student work by criteria not directly reflective of p erformance relative to course requirements. Grade Appeal Process Prior to implementing the formal appeal process, t he student must discuss in person the disputed grade with the instructor of the course within ten days of notification of the grade. The faculty member will respond in writing with a copy to the student and the Assistant Dean, En rollment and Student Services. If the dispute remains unresolved, the student may then initiate a formal appeal. All steps of the appeal process must be followed within the stated time frame or the appeal process is nullified (will not be heard). Steps to Initiate a Formal Appeal: 1. The student must submit a written statement detailing his or her objections to the faculty response, along with supporting documentation, to the Assistant Dean of Faculty Affairs with copy to the Assistant Dean for Enrollment and Student Services . This statement must be su bmitted within 14 days following the response of the faculty member who assigned the grade. 2. The Assistant Dean of Faculty Affairs must meet with the student and faculty member, either jointly or individually, within 14 days of receiving the appeal to att empt to resolve the issue. 3. The student must be notified in writing of the Assistant Dean of Faculty Affairs' decision within 21 days of receiving the student's written appeal. As the Dean's designee, the decision of the Assistant Dean of Faculty Affairs shall be the final decision at the College level. 4. Provost Review. The student may request the Provost to review the final decision on the record. A written Request for a Provost Review must be made by the student himself/herself, with a copy to the Dean of the College of Nursing , postmarked within thirty (30) calendar days of the postmark of the College's final decision. The Provost's review of the College's decision will proceed as soon as practicable after notification by the student of his/her wish to seek review. The student may also file with the Provost a Request for a Postponement of the effect of the College's final decision. Such a Request must be postmarked within seven (7) calendar days of the postmark of the College's final decision, and a co py must be sent to the Dean of the College. Upon receiving a Request for Postponement, the Provost will immediately contact the Dean.

The Provost will inform the student and the Dean of her/his decision regarding the Request for Postponement within three (3) school days after receiving the request. Exceptions to this procedure may be granted by the Provost upon a showing of good and sufficient cause. Pursuant to University policy, the Provost's decision in an academic appeal is final.

The following indicators are to be used as guidelines for evalua ting safe or professional practice: 1. Biological , psychological, social and cultural realms The student's practice meets the needs of the client from a biological, psychological, sociological and cultural standpoint. Examples of unsafe practice include, but are not limited to, the following: Displays of mental, physical or emotional behavior(s) which may negatively affect others' well being Failure to follow through on suggested referrals or interventions to correct deficit areas, which may result in harm to others Acts of omission or commission in the care of clients /patients , such as: o Physical abuse o Placing the client in hazardous positions, conditions or circumstances o Mental or emotional abuse, and o Medication errors that demonstrate a pattern of incorrectly preparing/administering medications and/or failure to follow through with direction/remediation regarding medication administration o Failure to accurately record comprehensive client behaviors o Attempting activities with out adequate orientation or theoretical preparation or appropriate assistance o Presenting for clinical practicum under the influence of drugs and/or alcohol (It is expected that students in laboratory settings will not have used alcohol for at least eight ( 8) hours prior to the beginning of the clinical time period, nor to use alcohol during the clinical period. At no time is the use of illicit drugs condoned). o Engaging in criminal behavior Interpersonal relationships with agency staff, co -workers, peers, o r faculty that results in miscommunications, disruption of client care and/or unit functioning; 31 Inability to perform psychomotor skills necessary for carrying out procedures despite direction/remediation. 2. Accountability The student's behavior should consistently demonstrate accountability and professionalism throughout the clinical practicum experience. Examples of unprofessional practice include, but are not limited to the following: Failure to notify the agency and/or instructor of clinical absence Failure to adhere to the dress code Habitual tardiness to clinical assignments Failure to follow through or successfully meet identified learning goals as outlined in a process improvement plan Failure to provide concise, inclusive, written and verbal comm unication 3.

Examples of regulatory violations include but are not limited to the following: Violations of patient privacy (HIP AA) Participating in skills or behaviors that are outside of the nursing scope of practice while in the clinical agency. Violation of clinical permit requirements. 5. Ethical The student practices according to the American Nurses Association Code of Ethics and the Standards of Practice. Examples of unethical practice include, but are not limited to the following: Refusal of assignment based on client's race, culture, sexual orient ation, or religious preference Failure to maintain confidentiality Misrepresentation of information to the public 32 Ignoring unethical behavior(s) of other health care persons in the clinical setting which affects client welfare. Procedure for Dealing with Unsafe Behaviors in the Clinical Setting 1. When a clinical instructor makes the determination that a student in the clinical setting has displayed behavior that poses a safety risk to the student, patient, staff, faculty or fellow students, the student shall immed iately be relieved of patient care respo nsibilities and assigned non-patient care responsibilities until the end of that clinical day (a library assignment is an example of an approp riate alternate assignment). The student will not be sent home at this time but will be told that a determinat ion of a corrective course of action will be arrived at after consu ltation with the course coordinator. The student will not be able to return to clinical until resolution. 2. Within 24 hours , the clinical faculty will write up the incident detailing the clinical events that transpired leading up to the removal of the student from patient care. 3. The clinical faculty will notify the course coordinator within 24 hours of the incident. The course coordinator will immediately notify the Assistant Dean of Faculty Affairs and the Assistant Dean , Enrollment and Student Services via email . 4. The course coord inator, in collaboration with the clinical faculty and Assistant Dean (if necessary), will determine a corrective course of action that may include supervised skill review on campus, written work, and/or an evaluation of student performance by a third party, e.g. the course coord inator or the course coordinator's designee. Corrective course of action may include exclusion from the program. 5. A meeting will be held which includes the student, the Assistant Dean of Enrollment and Student Services or designee and, at a minimum, the clinical faculty, the course coordinator, and the Area Assistant Dean or designee. The student will be given advance notice of the time and place of this meeting and will be allowed to have an advisor or support person w ith him/her. At this meeting , a written summary of the observed clinical behavior as well as the plan for corrective action including time frames for completion will be presented to the student for discussion and signature. The meeting will occur within three business days of the notification of the course coordinator. If the student fails to appear without extenuating circumstances, he or she will be excluded from the program and notified of exclusion by registered mail. Official exclusion (if this is the decision) occurs at this point. 6. If it is determined that the student is excluded from the program, the student is advised to contact the Assistant Dean, Enrollment and Student Services, or designee to learn about the Appeal Policy. 33 Appeal Process for Exclusion for Unsafe Practice in the C linical Setting A student may appeal his/her exclusion from the program for unsafe practice by following the guidelines for appeal identified below. Steps to Initiate a Formal Appeal: 1. A written appeal outlining the student's view point of the circumstances which caused the student's removal from the clinical course and the rationale for the appeal must be submitted within five business days of the exclusion to the Assistant Dean, Enroll ment and Student Services . Appeals submitted after the two day deadline will not be heard. 2. Within one two business day of the receipt of an appeal, the Assistant Dean of Faculty Affairs and the Associate Dean for Academic and Clinical Affairs (serving as the Dean's designee) will review the documentation provided by the instructor and the student and make a decision, which is final. The decision will be forwarded to the Assistant Dean , Enrollment and Student Services, who will notify th e student. 3. If the appeal is sustained and the student is allowed to return to the clinical setting, arrangements will be made for the student to make up missed time. Any absences sustained during this time will not fall under the clinical absenteeism polic y. 4. If the appeal is denied, the e xclusion from the clinical setting will result in an F grade for the course. 5. Provost Appeal. The student may request the Provost to review the final decision on the record. A written Request for a Provost Review must be made by the student himself/herself, with a copy to the Dean of the College of Nursing , postmarked within thirty (30) calendar days of the postmark of the College's final decision. The Provost's review of the College's decision will proceed as soon as pra cticable after notification by the student of his/her wish to seek review. Pursuant to University policy, the Provost's decision in an academic appeal is final. 34 OTHER COLLEGE OF NURSING APPEALS FOR EXCLUSION BASED ON ACADEMIC PERFORM ANCE OR ACADEMIC MISCONDUCT Steps to Initiate a Formal Appeal: 1. The student must submit a written statement detailing the basis of the appeal , along with supporting documentation, to the Assistant Dean of Faculty Affairs with copy to the Assistant Dean, Enrollment and Student Services, and the Associate Dean for Academic and Clinical Affairs.

See the Undergraduate Bulletin at www.bulletins.wayne.edu . Revised 7/2/2010 36 STUDENT CODE OF CONDU CT 1.0 PREAMBLE 1.1 The primary purposes of the Student Code of Conduct are to promote campus civility and academic integrity and to provide a framework for the imposition of discipline in the University setting. The code gives general notice of prohibited conduct and of the sanctions to be imposed if such conduct occurs. The code should be read broadly, and is not designed to define misconduct in exhaustive terms. The code specifies the rights of the student and the rights of other parties to the procedure. 1.2 As provided by the Board of Governors in WSUCA 2.31.01, \"Student Rights and Responsibilities,\" and as mandated by academic tradition, the students of Wayne State University possess specific rights and responsibilities. Students are expected to conduct themselves in a manner conducive to an environment that encourages the free exchange of ideas and information. As integral members of the academic community, students have the right to expect that their rights are protected from arbitrary, capricious and malicious acts o n the part of other members of the academic community. This Student Code of Conduct is designed to assure that students who are alleged to have engaged in unacceptable conduct receive fair and impartial consideration as specified in this code. 1.3 Stude nts are accountable both to civil authorities and to the University for acts which constitute violations of both the law and this code. In such cases disciplinary action at the University will normally proceed while civil or criminal proceedings are pendin g, and will not be subject to challenge on the grounds that civil or criminal charges involving the same incident have been invoked, dismissed or reduced. 1.4 Final authority in student disciplinary matters is vested in the President or his/her designee . 1.5 The Office of the Ombudsperson is available to advise students at any stage in the proceedings provided for in this code. To assure that students are aware of that availability, whenever charges are initiated against a student or student organizat ion, the Student Conduct Officer will provide the student (or representative of the student organization) with a copy of a memorandum prepared by the Ombudsperson explaining the Ombudsperson's role. 2.0 DEFINITIONS When used in this code: 2.1 \"Acade mic misbehavior\" means any activity which tends to compromise the academic integrity of the institution or subvert the education process.

The Student Conduct Officer may revoke her/his permission for the presence of an advisor or attorney at any time if, in her/h is judgment, it is not improving the quality of the conference. 42 7.0 INTERIM SUSPENSION Whenever there is evidence that the continued presence of a student on University premises poses a substantial threat to that student or to others, or to the stabilit y and continuance of normal University functions, the President, Provost or his/her designee, and after consultation with the Office of the General Counsel, may suspend the student for an interim period pursuant to these disciplinary procedures. In matter s of academic misconduct, the Provost's designee will ordinarily be the student's Academic Dean; in matters of nonacademic misconduct, the Dean of Students. Notice of the interim suspension shall be mailed to the student. The interim suspension may be made immediately effective, without prior notice, and may provide for complete exclusion from University premises except for the appearance provided for in Section 7.1, which appearance may be scheduled to occur at the Public Safety headquarters. 7.1 A stude nt suspended on an interim basis shall be given an opportunity to appear personally before the University officer who suspended the student, or before his/her designee, within five school days from the date of the interim suspension. Notice of the time and place of the appearance shall be included in the notice of suspension.

The faculty panel shall be selected by the faculty governing body within the college and the student panel shall be selected by the student governing body within the college. The respective governing bodies shall determine how large a panel, within these limits, is desired. If either governing body fails to act by O ctober 15, the Academic Dean shall determine the size of the panel and shall select the panelists. Vacancies occurring during the year which bring the size of the panel below eight shall be filled within one month of the vacancy's occurring by the appropri ate faculty body or student body, or, if they fail to act, by the Academic Dean. 43 8.2 Non-Academic Misbehavior Committee Panels: The Academic Senate and the Student Council shall each establish a standing panel for the purpose of processing cases involvin g individual students or student organizations charged with non -academic misbehavior.

The files of students found in violation of any of the charges against them will be retained as a disci plinary record for the duration of time specified in the sanction, but no less than five years. If the sanction includes a Transcript Disciplinary Record pursuant to Section 5.10, disciplinary records shall be retained permanently if the transcript entry is permanent, or, if the entry is for a specified period of time, for five years after the end of that period. Disciplinary records may be retained for as long as litigation or administrative proceedings are pending regarding the matter. The Student Condu ct Officer shall keep a list of the hearing panels in all colleges and in the Academic Senate and Student Council, and shall report promptly to the Provost, and to the appropriate dean or president, any college or Academic Senate which does not have in pla ce a current, complete panel. The Student Conduct Officer shall prepare an annual report for the Board of Governors describing how this code has functioned during the year and, if the Student Conduct Officer believes changes are desirable, recommending th ose changes. 10.0 PRELIMINARY PROCEDURE Any person may initiate charges against one or more students or a student organization believed 44 to have violated this code, by filing charges with, and by providing information pertinent to the case, to the Studen t Conduct Officer, both in writing.

Any person, including the student, who disrupts a hearing or who fails to adhere to the rulings of the Chai rperson may be excluded from the proceedings. 15.13 Hearings will normally be recorded.

This section does not apply in cases of charges filed against student organizations. 17.2 A student organization and its officers may be held collectively or individually respons ible when violations of this code by those associated with the organization have received the tacit or overt consent or encouragement of the organization or of the organization's leaders, officers, or spokespersons. 17.3 As a part of the decision in the case, the officers or leaders or any identifiable spokespersons for a student organization may be directed to take appropriate action designed to prevent or end violations of this code by the organization or by any persons associated with the organization who can reasonably be said to be acting in the organization's behalf. Failure to make reasonable efforts to comply with such a directive shall be considered a violation of this code both by the officers, leaders or spokespersons for the organization and b y the organization itself. 17.4 Sanctions for organization misconduct may include revocation or denial of recognition, as well as other appropriate sanctions pursuant to Section 5 of this code. 18.0 APPEAL PROCESS 18.1 If as the result of a formal hearing process, a sanction is imposed the student or representative(s) of the organization may request the President or his/her designee to review the decision on the record.

Appellate review of the college's decision will proceed as soon as practicable after notification by the student of his/her wish to seek review. The Presiden t or his/her designee may affirm, reverse or modify the decision or the sanction, or, in unusual circumstances, may send the matter back to the college. The President or his/her designee shall notify the student, the Dean, the charging party, and the Stude nt Conduct Officer of the decision, in writing, within a reasonable time. 18.2 In individual cases (not organization cases), the student may also file with the President or his/her designee a Request for Postponement of the effect of the Dean's final decision. Such request must be postmarked within seven school days of the postmark o f the Dean's final decision, and a copy must be sent to the Dean. Upon receipt of a Request for Postponement, the President or his/her designee will immediately contact the Dean. Unless the college or the Dean of Students demonstrates that the injury to the college or University or to third persons that would result from a postponement would outweigh the injury to the student from denying the postponement, the effect of the decision rendered by the Dean will be postponed until the date that the President or his/her designee issues a decision regarding the underlying Request for Appellate Review. 53 The President or his/her designee will inform the student and the Dean of his/her decision regarding the Request for Postponement within three school days after receiving the request. Exceptions to this procedure may be granted by the President or his/her designee upon a showing of good and sufficient cause. 18.3.
