This is a presentation I did at the Washington Academy of Physician Assistants conference in Oct 2013. CAM: WHO CARES? What is a naturopath? Herbs, mason jars, magic rocks, and bird masks? 2 3 Primary Care Providers emphasizing: Prevention, treatment and optimal health through the use of therapeutic methods and substances which encourage the person's inherent self - healing process. In WA: NDs have full prescriptive rights, with the exception of schedule I, II, and IIIs Via various modalities... Schooling, boards, annual CME, sigh In 16 states so far HOMEOPATHY Most remedies have very little or none of the original crude material left by the end of its processing. This is the process we use. Creating a Mother Tincture: Made from a specific plant source is processed by macerating the plant, then letting it soak in an alcohol water solution. Draws the properties of the plant into the water and alcohol. This tinctured solution is now called the mother tincture. Potentiation By Succussion: The mother tincture is put through the basic process of being potentised. One drop of the mother tincture is put into a vial and then nine drops of a diluting material is added (again an alcohol and water solution). This mixture is succussed (shaken with impact). Succussion is essential. *What is acting is not the remedy. It's the person's immune system, their energy and body processes which are responding. A dilution that small cannot push your body to do anything. It can only suggest, which gives your body the choice to change or not. 4 IBS: BATHROOM BREAKS AGAIN? Fiber & antispasmodics Triggers - foods, stress. My own triggers: My clinical rotations! Certain patients? IBS Testing? ND treatments 8 ECZEMA: THE SKIN STORY Creams, steroid creams, then stronger steroid creams. Triggers! R/O foods. Probiotics again 9 1 IN 3 ARE OBESE! EVER FEEL LIKE THIS GUY?

IBS and Eczema: Food allergy/sensitivity testing: Foods act as medicine but also as toxins (inflammation) 3. Supplements: Look at brand of supplements used in the studies (Pfizer owns Centrum and bought Alacer/Emergen-C), Bayer owns One A Day), Proctor & Gamble bought New Chapter). 4. Obesity and Burnout: How to get those patients to change their Lifestyle! Tortoise and the Hare/Microwave society, stress reduction, adrenal support. 18 SHOW ME THE STUDY Weight: Dr. Oz and HCG.

Creating a Mother Tincture: Made from a specific plant source is processed by macerating the plant, then letting it soak in an alcohol water solution. Draws the properties of the plant into the water and alcohol. This tinctured solution is now called the mother tincture.Potentiation By Succussion: The mother tincture is put through the basic process of being potentised. One drop of the mother tincture is put into a vial and then nine drops of a diluting material is added (again an alcohol and water solution). This mixture is succussed (shaken with impact). Succussion is essential. Succussion can be as simple as holding the vial containing the solution and pounding it against a book on a desk. This is now a 1X potency. X stands for ten in Roman numerals. To make a 2X potency you take one part of the 1X potency again adding it to nine parts of the diluting solution (alcohol and water) in a vial with a lid, and then succus it. Succussion is done at a minimum of 100 times per each level of dilution starting from the very beginning. This process continues until the desired potency (strength) of the remedy is attained. Common Potencies And Their Lack Of Toxicity Common potencies usually begin around 6X. The dilution ratio of 6X is one part of the original mother tincture to one million parts of the diluting material. So, only one part of the original mother tincture is in every million parts of the diluting material. This is what makes remedies extremely safe. Now watch.6X is already extremely dilute, but considered a low potency. More frequently used potencies are, 12X which is one part to 1,000,000,000,000 (whatever that number is), 30X which is one part to this astrological number: 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000. These are infinitesimal doses. What is acting is not the remedy. It's the person's immune system, their energy and body processes which are responding. A dilution that small cannot push your body to do anything. It can only suggest, which gives your body the choice to change or not.Common C Potencies C Potencies are also quite common. Commonly denoted as 6C, 12C, or 30C. C is 100, again in Roman Numerals. So, the one big difference in C Potencies is one part of the Mother Tincture is added to 99 parts of diluting solution (water and alcohol) and succussed for a 1C potency, and so on, until the desired potency. C potencies are more diluted then X potencies, but not less effective. "}
