It relies on a science which fixes an illness process in time and space analytically, through pathology, chemical assay, and genetics. This method is valuable because it makes the mechanics of the process much easier to see, but this method alone can have a rigidifying effect on our thinking because our view gets ever smaller. A different, but complementary approach is to look at the world more synthetically.
