An integrative treatment plan with us might just be what you need for overall wellness. Here's everything to know about integrative medicine and bipolar disorder. What is Bipolar Disorder? Characterized as a mood disorder, bipolar disorder results in episodes of elevated (also known as manic) and depressive moods. Patients diagnosed with bipolar disorder can have one of three types: - bipolar I disorder - bipolar II disorder - cyclothymia Sometimes patients can experience manic and depressive symptoms in the same episode. In addition to medication, an integrative approach to bipolar disorder can help manage your symptoms, increase the quality of life, and improve your overall mental and emotional wellbeing. What Are the Benefits of Integrative Bipolar Disorder Treatments? There are multiple benefits to opting for integrative therapies to manage your symptoms of bipolar disorder. As we've already mentioned, they do not involve narcotics and are incredibly non-invasive forms of treatment. In some cases, patients can experience a noticeable improvement in their mood and emotions after just a few sessions. Common forms of integrative treatment for bipolar disorder include: - Meditation - Hypnosis - Guided Imagery - Yoga and other mind-body practices such as tai chi and qi gong - Naturopathy and herbal supplements Recent studies indicate that different forms of light therapy, including dark therapy, bright light therapy, and sleep deprivation, can all be effective in treating patients with bipolar disorder. The effectiveness increases when combined with other forms of integrative treatment. What to Expect During an Integrative Bipolar Disorder Treatment Session If you've never had an integrative treatment for bipolar disorder, you might be wondering what to expect during your first appointment. A certified psychologist or psychiatrist at One Source Integrative Medicine will begin by asking you a comprehensive set of questions to determine your current health, emotions, and mental wellbeing. From there, your doctor will conduct a series of tests, including lab tests, to rule out any other illnesses or disorders that may be causing your symptoms. A treatment plan is highly individualized and will depend on your medical history, lifestyle, and existing symptoms. Some patients may find immediate relief from these integrative approaches. But others may notice a difference only after several weeks. Most, however, continue treatment plans to maintain their overall levels of wellness. Effective management of bipolar disorder requires an accurate evaluation and prompt care using safe, effective integrative techniques.
