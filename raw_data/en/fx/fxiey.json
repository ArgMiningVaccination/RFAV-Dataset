Protocol 1: By the Will of the Father Jesus only does what the Father shows Him. Joh 5:19 Then Jesus answered and said to them, \"Most assuredly, I say to you, the Son can do nothing of Himself, but what He sees the Father do; for whatever He does, the Son also does in like manner. Joh 5:20 For the Father loves the Son, and shows Him all things that He Himself does; and He will show Him greater works than these, that you may marvel. Jesus is under the authority of the Father - He has authority because He is under authority. The same applies in a network of Churches where we operate in mutual submission, under the authority of Jesus Christ the Head of the Church, the Chief Cornerstone - as we sang in worship tonight! Joh 14:10 Do you not believe that I am in the Father, and the Father in Me? The words that I speak to you I do not speak on My own authority; but the Father who dwells in Me does the works. Php 2:13 for it is God who works in you both to will and to do for His good pleasure. Rom 12:2 And do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God. Protocol 2: In Jesus' Name Do not let theologians make void the power of God by telling you that you can only say Jesus in Jewish! That is ridiculous! When people argue with you, overcome their futile remarks by the Blood of the Lamb, the word of your testimony and not loving your life unto death. Yesterday we prayed in Japanese and said Jesus in their language - we have affected a nation through handing out tracts telling them to turn to the living God in the name of Jesus - in their language - and we are seeing the first harvest already! Friends from Japan are watching our meetings live and accessing the power in that wonderful name of Jesus! When people get all technical and high minded - just ask them a simple question: \"Have you driven out demons in Jesus' name? Have you laid hands on the sick in Jesus' name?\" Then you can proceed to give God the glory for the instances in your life where the name of Jesus has worked for you and that is that. Hopefully, they will see that the traditions of men make void the power of God. They will see the fruit in your life and glorify God! Php 2:5 Let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus, Php 2:6 who, being in the form of God, did not consider it robbery to be equal with God, Php 2:7 but made Himself of no reputation, taking the form of a bondservant, and coming in the likeness of men. Php 2:8 And being found in appearance as a man, He humbled Himself and became obedient to the point of death, even the death of the cross. Php 2:9 Therefore God also has highly exalted Him and given Him the name which is above every name, Php 2:10 that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of those in heaven, and of those on earth, and of those under the earth, Php 2:11 and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father. God works miracles through us in Jesus' name... Act 3:16 And His name, through faith in His name, has made this man strong, whom you see and know. Yes, the faith which comes through Him has given him this perfect soundness in the presence of you all. Joh 14:12 \"Most assuredly, I say to you, he who believes in Me, the works that I do he will do also; and greater works than these he will do, because I go to My Father. Joh 14:13 And whatever you ask in My name, that I will do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son. Joh 14:14 If you ask anything in My name, I will do it. Protocol 3: By the Power and agency of the Holy Spirit Act 1:8 But you shall receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you; and you shall be witnesses to Me in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the end of the earth.\" Act 4:29 Now, Lord, look on their threats, and grant to Your servants that with all boldness they may speak Your word, Act 4:30 by stretching out Your hand to heal, and that signs and wonders may be done through the name of Your holy Servant Jesus.\" Act 4:31 And when they had prayed, the place where they were assembled together was shaken; and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and they spoke the word of God with boldness. And the result of being filled with the Holy Spirit: Act 4:33 And with great power the apostles gave witness to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus. And great grace was upon them all. To conclude, we do the will of the Father in the name of Jesus by the power of the Holy Spirit. "}
