Adequate breathing does not require positive pressure ventilation Inadequate breathing is caused by o An inadequate tidal volume o An ina dequate rate o A combination of both Inadequate breathing requires immediate management wit h positive pressure ventilation Alveolar v entilation (V a) - The amount of air that moves in and out of the alveoli per minute Alveolar ventilation consists of: ( tidal volume ( Vt) minus dead air (T d) space) multiplied by respiratory rate in one minute. o Va = (V t - Vd) x F Tidal volume - The volume of air a person moves in and out of the respiratory system in each breath Dead air space - The volume of air during breat hing that does not reach the alveoli or is not involved in gas exchange Respiratory rate (Frequency (F)) - The number of tim es a person breathes per minute Alveolar ventilation = ( Vt - Td) x F example: (500mL of air - 150mL) x 12 breaths per minute = 4 200mL/minute) The difference between minute ventilation and alveolar ventilation is important because alveolar ventilation is the volume of air reaching the alveoli that participates in gas exchange (what oxygenates the blood.) By increasing the rate of ventilation in a patient with shallow breathing (inadequate tidal volume) may maintain the minute ventilation near normal, however alveolar ventilation (gas exchange) would be inadequate. 4 Example: Mrs. Smith has increased her respiratory ra te from 12 to 24 times per minute, however her tidal volume with each breath has decreased from 500mL to 250mL. This means that she is breathing faster but shallow. Her minute ventilation is now (250mL x 24 per minute) 6000mL which appears to be normal. Because of her respiratory rate increase she is able to move what appears to be an adequate volume of air per minute. Mrs. Smith's tidal volume is 250mL, however dead air space is taking up 150mL per breath. This means that only 100mL of air is availabl e for gas exchange per breath. She is inadequately oxygenating her blood. Although her minute ventilation appears to be within normal limits, her alveolar ventilation ([250mL - 150mL] x 24 per minute = 2400mL/minute) is inadequate. This will lead to hyp oxemia and will result in a decrease in her SpO reading. She requires positive pressure ventilation. Effect Of Ventilation On Venous Return And Cardiac Output In the normal patient, the negative pressure that causes inhalation facilitates venous retur n necessary for adequate cardiac output and perfusion. Remind the class what cardiac output is. Cardiac output is the amount of blood ejected from the left ventricle in one minute (Stroke Volume x Heart Rate) . Stroke Volume = Amount of blood ejected fro m the left ventricle with each contraction . Heart Rate = Number of times the heart contracts in one minute. To demonstrate this, take a full breath of air and explain to the student that during inhalation , a large volume of venous blood is returned to the heart because of the extreme negative pressure generated during inhalation. Negative pressure during inhalation allows venous blood return to the right side of the heart, which is necessary for adequate cardiac output. When artificial ventilation is being delivered, air is pushed into the chest (positive pressure ventilation). The increase in intrathoracic pressure impedes the amount of blood flow back to the heart. Each time you deliver ventilations, you are making the intrathoracic pressure po sitive. More frequent ventilations cause a greater duration of positive pressure in the chest than a patient with normal spontaneous breathing, which further impedes blood return and reduces cardiac output and perfusion of the vital organs. 5 Positive pressure in the thorax during ventilation impedes venous blood return to the right side of the heart, decreasing cardiac output. Excessive ventilation rates during positive pressure ventilation result in a decrease in cardiac output and perfusion. In the adult patient, artificial ventilatory rates greater than 12 times per minute (one ventilation every 5 -6 seconds) decrease cardiac output and perfusion; therefore if you are artificially ventilating a patient, do not exceed a ventilatory rate of 10 -12 times per minute (one ventilation every 5 -6 seconds). High artificial ventilatory rates (greater than 12 times per minute, one breath every 5 -6 seconds) result in poor patient outcomes. [This must be clearly reinforced and integrated into scenarios that include artificial ventilation.] Exercise: Ask each student to breathe 10 times per minute and count out their breaths while you count the seconds between breaths (one breath every 5 -6 seconds). Respiratory Distress vs. Failure All respiratory conditi ons are dynamic and fall with a spectrum from minor respiratory distress to respiratory arrest. Respiratory conditions can be acute, chronic, or chronic with acute exacerbation. Signs and symptoms that are present when EMS arrives are dynamic and could change over time depending on the state of the patient's disease process. Many patients with respiratory diseases remain in some phase of distress and need only comfort care. What remains important for an EMS provider to know when exactly to provide an i ntervention (such as artificial ventilation) in order to increase the likelihood of patient improvement. Recognizing the transition of a respiratory disease from distress to respiratory failure is of paramount importance in EMS care. 6 Revi ew signs of distress and failure Respiratory distress Respiratory failure When a patient in respiratory distress begins to exhibit deterioration in mental status because of hypoxia, the EMS provider needs to provide assisted artificial ventilations. Many other signs or symptoms can accompany this deterioration in mental status including decrease in SpO , cyanosis, accessory muscle use, head bobbing, grunting, nasal flaring or confusion. Patients in respiratory failure have inadequate alveolar ventilation which will be exhibited by either a decrease in or an excessively high respiratory rate (reducing t idal volume and amount of air available for alveolar gas exchange) a decrease in tidal volume, or both. Patients in respiratory failure are severely ill. When providing artificial ventilation it is critical that you ventilate no more than 10 -12 times per minute (every 5 -6 seconds). Artificial ventilations provided at a rate greater than 10 -12 times per minute could compromise cardiac output and perfusion. 7 Lab Skills 1. Your assessment draws you to the conclusion that the pat ient needs artificial ventilation. Patients receiving assisted ventilation will be anxious when you cover their face and force air into their lungs. You must explain this procedure to the patient and reassure him you will be helping him breathe easier an d improve his ability to receive oxygen. Tell the patient that it may be necessary to take occasional breaks if he becomes anxious. 2. This procedure is best accomplished with the patient in the semi -Fowler's position. 3. The head should be placed in a sniffing position and no airway adjunct should be placed. 4. Attach the BVM to supplemental oxygen to deliver the highest concentration of oxygen. 5. Observe the patient's respirations and when they begin to inhale, gently squeeze the BVM and deliver the ventilation ove r 1-2 seconds and with a low volume (do not squeeze the bag with high pressure) . 6. Allow the patient to exhale normally. 7. During the next inhalation deliver another ventilation over 1 -2 seconds until you see some chest rise. 8. Continue this process until the pa tient's mental status improves or you are ventilating 10 -12 times per minute with adequate tidal volume. Patients who are breathing at a rate of less than 10 times per minute should receive assisted ventilations at a rate of 10 -12 times per minute. Patients who are breathing at an excessively high rate (greater than 30) should receive assisted ventilations to bring their rate down to 10 -12 times per minute. Some patients in respiratory failure may have a severely altered mental state and no longer have a gag reflex. In this case, insertion of an airway adjunct is indicated. Ventilate the patient at a rate of 10 -12 times per minute (every 5 -6 seconds). Assisted ventilation practice - It is suggested that each student in the class should assist the ve ntilation of a spontaneously breathing person. It is required that each student watch a video of an awake and spontaneously breathing patient receiving assisted ventilations. Some recommended methods to complete this practice session include high fidelit y simulator, anesthetized patients in an operating room or outpatient clinical setting. 8 Automated Transport Ventilators A patient requiring artificial ventilation for a period of time may benefit the use of an automated transport ventilator (ATV ). An ATV can be used whether a patient is intubated or not. Advantages Can be used for breathing and non -breathing patients, intubated and non - intubated patients Can be used in patients in respiratory failure and apneic patients Frees the rescuer for ot her tasks when used in intubated patients In patients who are not intubated, the rescuer has both hands free to apply the mask and maintain the airway Adjustable settings; once set, provides a specific tidal volume, respiratory rate and minute ventilation Disadvantages Need for an oxygen source, and sometimes electric power Inability to detect increasing airway resistance Some ATVs should not be used in children younger than 5 years old Positioning In The Pediatric Patient For Artificial Ventilation According to the American Heart Association Pediatric Advanced Life Support Provider Manual (2011): \"A \"sniffing\" position without hyperextension of the neck is usually best for infants and toddlers. To achieve a sniffing position, place the child supine . Flex the child's neck forward at the level of the shoulders while extending the head. Position the opening of the external ear canal at the level of or in front of the anterior aspect of the shoulder while the head is extended. Avoid hyperextending th e neck because this may obstruct the airway. Children under 2 years of age may require padding under the occiput. Younger children and infants may need padding under the shoulders or upper torso to prevent excessive flexion of the neck that can occur whe n the prominent occiput rests on a flat surface.\" Show the class the drawings of the sniffing position in the 2011 PALS book, figure 4 page 64. 9 Page intentionally left blank 10 NCCR Topic OXYGENATION Patient Group Adult and Pediatric Provider Level Emergency Medical Techn ician (EMT) Instructor Preparation Review National EMS Education Standards Learning Objectives By the end of this lesson, the student will be able to: Review physiology related to oxygen transport and metabolism Recite the AHA's guidelines on oxygen the rapy in the acute coronary syndrome and stroke patient Discuss the role of free radicals related to oxygen therapy Curriculum Hours 1 hour CONTENT In 1994, the EMT National Standard Curriculum recommended that patients with chest pain receive oxygen b y non -rebreather mask at 15 L/min . In 2000, the American Heart Association Guidelines recommended that patients with chest pain receive oxygen by nasal cannula at 2 -4 L/min . In 2010, the American Heart Association Guidelines now recommend that patients w ith suspected acute coronary syndrome (ACS) not receive oxygen unless they have a n SpO of less than 94% (on room air) or complain of dyspnea, have signs and symptoms of shock or heart failure. If the pulse oximeter is unreliable or not available, oxygen should be administered. Oxygenation of chest pain and stroke patients has changed. Patients that complain of dyspnea, experience signs and symptoms of shock, heart failure, or have an SpO of less than 94% should receive oxy gen at 2 L/minute via nasal cannula Oxygen administration should be titrated to maintain an SpO of at lea st 94% 11 Delivery of high concentrations of oxygen to ACS and stroke patients who are not hypoxic may increase tissue damage. The reason that oxygen is no longer recommended is because of the release of \"free radicals .\" Free radicals are byproducts o f metabolism that when released in large numbers are toxic to neighboring cells, destroying their membranes and causing increased local tissue damage Reintroduction of a high concentration of oxygen to cells that have been functioning anaerobically increas es the production of free radicals causing cell membrane damage and tissue death When EMS providers deliver high concentrations of oxygen to patients with suspected ACS or stroke, delivering high concentrations of oxygen may be more harmful than keeping the patient on room air 12 NCCR Topic POST -RESUSCITATION CARE Recognition of Return of Spontaneous Circulation (ROSC) Oxygenation Induced hypothermia ( only limited depth and breadth ) Patient Group Adult and Pediatric Provider Level Emergency Medical Technician (EMT) Instructor Preparation Review National EMS Education Standards Review current AHA Guidelines Learning Objectives By the end of this lesson, the student will be able to: Identify the signs of ROSC Describe the pr inciples of optimization of ventilation and oxygenation Appreciate the benefits of induced hypothermia in post cardiac arrest management Describe systems of care necessary for improving post cardiac arrest outcomes Curriculum Hours 0.5 hour CONTENT Recognition of ROSC In the cardiac arrest patient, CPR must be continued until signs of life are observed o Patient breathing o Patient movement Optimizing ventilation and oxygenation in the post cardiac arrest patient The goal for oxygenation in the post c ardiac arrest patient is to maintain an SpO of greater than or equal to 94%.

Common Cognitive Impairments Mental retardation (MR) Generalized disorder appearing before adulthood characterized by significantly impaired cognitive functioning and deficits in 2 or more adaptive behaviors Syndromic mental retardation - intellectual deficits associated with other medical an d behavioral signs and symptoms Non-syndromic mental retardation - intellectual deficits that appear without other abnormalities Down Syndrome (Downs) A complex of symptoms associated with mental retardation caused by chromosomal abnormalities Common physical signs o Mental retardation o Decreased muscle tone at birth o Upward slanting eyes o Wide, short hands wi th short fingers Common mental and social complications o Impulsive behavior o Poor judgment o Short attention span o Slow learning 37 Cerebral Palsy (CP) A group of chronic, non -progressive disorders caused by damage to the motor centers of the brain in the early stages of life Most of these problems occur in the womb, but can happen any time during the first 2 years of life while the brain is developing Characterized by o Abnormal muscle tone and posture o Muscular spasms o Hearing and vision problems o Seizures Cause is difficult to determine o May be caused by Low levels of oxygen Infection Head injury RH incompatibility Infections in the mother ( e.g. Rubella, Herpes Simplex) 38 NCCR Topic OB EMERGENCIES presentations o Nuchal cord Neonatal resuscitation o Routine suctioning of the neonate Patient Group Adult and Pediatric as applicable Provider Level Emergency Medical Technician (EMT) Instructor Preparation Review National EMS Education Standards Review current AHA Guidel ines Learning Objectives By the end of this lesson, the student will be able to: Understand abnormal presentations present during childbirth Discuss the actions the EMT would take when managing a patient with an abnormal presentation during delivery Desc ribe a nuchal cord presentation Discuss the actions the EMT should take when a nuchal cord is present during delivery Recognize the need for neonatal resuscitation during delivery Discuss the management principles of neonatal resuscitation Discuss the AHA' s position on routinely suctioning the airway of a newborn Curriculum Hours 1 hour CONTENT Abnormal Presentations In Childbirth Show pictures of and discuss the following abnormal presentations: Breech o Descriptions Frank - the buttocks are presentin g and the legs are up along the fetal chest Footling - either one foot or both feet are presenting Complete - the fetal thighs are flexed along the fetal abdomen, but the fetal shins and feet are tucked under the legs o Management - Provide supportive care a nd transport in the knee -chest position 39 Limb presentation o One leg or one arm presents first o Management - Provide supportive care and transport in the knee -chest position Compound o Fetal hand coming out with fetal head o Management - Provide supporti ve care and transport in the knee -chest position Shoulder presentation o The fetal shoulder is presenting first o Management - Provide supportive care and transport in the knee -chest position Multiple births o More than 1 fetus o Management - Provide supportive c are, transport and deliver as necessary Prolapsed cord o The umbilical cord is presenting first o Management - Provide supportive care, transport in the knee - chest position and insert gloved hand to apply pressure on the presenting part of the baby between co ntractions to relieve pressure on the umbilical cord. Relieving compression on the cord will enhance fetal circulation Shoulder dystocia o Cephalic presentation but the shoulders are unable to be passed beyond the symphysis pubis o \"Turtle sign\" o Management - Provide supportive care, perform the McRoberts maneuver (flexion and abduction of the maternal hips and knees to chest to open the pelvic ring) and apply pressure above the symphysis pubis with the heel of your gloved hand to help dislodge the shoulder fr om beneath the pubic bone Nuchal cord o Cephalic presentation but umbilical cord is around the neck o According to current research Nuchal cords are common and are rarely associated with morbidity or mortality in neonates 40 Neonatal Resuscitation Newborn s who do not require resuscitation can generally be identified by a rapid assessment of the following 3 characteristics: Full term gestation - 37 weeks Crying or breathing adequately - ensures patent airway Good muscle tone - moving all extremities If the answer to any of these assessment questions is \"no,\" resuscitation efforts should be attempted in the following sequence: First 30 seconds post -partum 1. Warm, clean airway if necessary, dry, stimulate 30-60 seconds post -partum 2. If heart rate below 100 , gasping or apnea, initiate positive pressure ventilation with room a ir and monitor. If labored breathing or persistent cyanosis, clear the airway , monitor , SpO and consider CPAP After 1 minute post -partum 3. If heart rate >100, provide post -resuscitation care. If HR < 100, take ventilation corrective steps (consider intubation) 4. If heart rate < 60, begin chest compressions, consider intubation, assess for hypervolemia and pneumothorax Newborn Care - Routine Suctioning Of The Airway Accordin g to the 2010 American Heart Association Guidelines for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Emergency Cardiovascular Care, suctioning the airway in the newborn may cause bradycardia. It is recommended that suctioning the newborn immediately following birth (including the use of a bulb syringe) should only be done in newborns who have an obvious obstruction to spontaneous breathing or who require positive pressure ventilation. The presence of meconium does not in itself require suctioning. 41 Additiona l OB Emergency Resources 1. Mastrobattista JM et al.

If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol -based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. Alcohol -based hand sanitizers can quickly reduce the number of germs on hands in som e situations, but sanitizers do not eliminate all types of germs. Alcohol -based hand sanitizers do not kill viruses, but create an inhospitable environment for viruses to live. Hand sanitizers are not effective when hands are visibly dirty. When your hands are visibly dirty, use soap and water. How to use alcohol -based hand sanitizers Apply the product to the palm of one hand Rub your hands together Rub the product over all surfaces of your hands and fingers until your hands are dry When soap and water become available, wash your hands 58 Vaccines available to healthcare provider Vaccines are an effective means to help prevent the transmission of certain diseases. Some vaccines are attenuated (weakened or killed) viruses, and some vaccines mimic certain diseases to produce antibodies in the blood. Other vaccines provide the antibodies directly. The instructor should review and discuss the CDC's current vaccine recommendations on vaccines for the health care provider. (http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp.htm ) Some vaccines that are recommended for the health care provider i nclude (but are not limited to) Hepatitis Influenza MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) Varicella Pneumococcal Pertussis Antibiotic resistant infections People infected with drug -resistant organisms are more likely to have longer and more expensive hospital stays, and may be more likely to die as a result of the infection. When the drug of choice for treating th eir infection doesn't work, they require treatment with second - or third - choice drugs that may be less effective, more toxic, and more expensive. This means that patients with an antimicrobial -resistant infection may suffer more and pay more for treatment. Antimicrobial drug resistance occurs everywhere in the world and is not limited to industrialized nations. Hospitals and other healthcare settings are battling drug -resistant organisms that spread inside these institutions. Drug -resistant infections also spread in the community at large. Patients with open skin wounds, those that have had recent surgery, or have undergone invasive procedures ( e.g. PICC lines, IVs, or other in -dwelling catheters) are more likely to contract an antibiotic resistant infecti on. 59 Some common antibiotic resistant infections that the EMS provider will come into contact with are: MRSA VRE VRSA Influenza According to the CDC Influenza viruses spread from person to person o Primarily through large -particle respiratory droplet transmission Requires close contact between source and recipient persons o Contact with respiratory -droplet contaminated surfaces is another possible source of transmission o Airborne transmission via small -particle residue of evaporated droplets that might remain suspended in the air for long periods of time is thought to be possible Typical incubation period for influenza is 1 -4 days (average: 2 days) Adults are contagious from the day before symptoms begin through 5 - 10 days after onset Young childr en also might be contagious several days before illness onset, and can be infectious for 10 or more days after onset of symptoms Severely immunocompromised persons can shed virus for weeks or months It is estimated that the influenza vaccine is ap proximately 60% effective. There are many strains of influenza that occur seasonally. The influenza viruses in the seasonal flu vaccine are selected each year based on surveillance -based forecasts about what viruses are most likely to cause illness in t he coming season. The seasonal flu vaccine is a trivalent vaccine (a three component vaccine) with each component selected to protect against one of the three main groups of influenza viruses circulating in humans. 60 Public Health Epidemic - The occurrence in a community of cases of an illness, specific health related behavior, or other health related events clearly in excess of normal expectancy Pandemic - A worldwide epidemic Disease and Injury Surveillance (EMS providers are in a unique pos ition) First contact Notice trends Common symptomatic presentations Geographical area Reporting Know who to contact in your system Policy/Parameters for what/when to report Centralized reporting o Help identify local/state/national trends in disease and injury o Data needs to be aggregated SIRS, Sepsis and Septic Shock Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) - Presence of two or more of the following: Temperature less than 97\u00b0F or greater than 100.4\u00b0F Heart rate greater than 90/min ute Respiratory rate greater than 20/min ute Sepsis - SIRS with a suspected or proven infection Septic Shock - Sepsis with refractory hypotension or signs of hypoperfusion despite adequate fluid resuscitation End organ dysfunction Oliguria Altered mental status Patients are considered to have septic shock if they have sepsis plus hypotension after aggressive fluid resuscita tion (up to 40mL /kg). 61 Page intentionally left blank 62 NCCR Topic AT-RISK POPULATIONS Pediatric Geriatric Economically disadvantaged Domestic violence Human trafficking Patient Group Adult and Pediatric Provider Level Emergency Medical Technician (EMT) Instructor Preparation Review National EMS Education Standards Review Department of Homeland Security Human Trafficking Resources http://www.dhs.gov/human -trafficking -awareness -training Learning Objectives By the end of this lesson, the student will be able to: Recognize the unique characteristics of at -risk populations Recall the appropriate act ions of EMTs in the presence of at -risk patients Recognition of circumstances that may indicate abuse o Domestic abuse o Human trafficking o Non-accidental trauma Recall appropriate actions of EMTs in the presence of abused patients Curriculum Hours 0.5 hour CONTENT Recognize the unique charact eristics of at -risk populations Pediatric o Wide range in development Neonatal to young adult o Non-verbal to highly communicative o Response to shock changes with organ development o Injury and illness patterns change wit h development o Depend on adults for protection and prevention Geriatric o Fragility is a better indicator of risk than age in years o Polypharmacy is common o Age-related cognitive impairment Dementia Delirium o Loss of independence 63 Recall the appropriate ac tions of EMTs in the presence of at -risk patients Assessment challenges o Unreliable historians Difficulty in relaying previous medical history, medications and other current therapies o Reliance on caregivers o Requires proper interpretation of the patient's verbal and non - verbal communication o EMT's interpretation of physical examination findings often drive care o Assess the environment in which patient was found and the need for additional follow -up Knowledge of community resources ( i.e., child protective ser vices, elder care, meals on wheels, etc.) Recognition of circumstances that may indicate abuse Domestic abuse [Boehme D (2001) EMS Response to Domestic Violence Curriculum and Resource Manual] o Documented studies of domestic violence generally report t he following physical sites and percentages of injuries: 14.5% Head 33% Face and neck 12% Back and buttocks 10% Breasts 16% Arms 5.5% Abdomen (Increases during pregnancy) 4% Genitals o Another important aspect of injuries from domestic violence refers to vic tims who are repeatedly abused.
