But what is an ionic foot bath, and what are the real benefits? The Ionic Foot Bath detoxifies your body and helps improve your overall health. It can help with conditions such as asthma, allergies, and arthritis. In this post, we'll explore the science behind this alternative treatment and look at some of the research on its potential effects. Read on to find out how this miraculous machine works and how you can experience its benefits for yourself! The Ionic Foot Detox: Fact or Myth? A recent fad has been sweeping the country: ionic foot detoxes. You may not recognize the name, but you probably have seen the infomercials about foot patches or foot baths that pull all the toxins out of your body through your feet, leaving you with a patch or bath full of brown liquid (aka the toxins). But is it all just a scam? Or is there actual scientific proof to support these claims? Ionic therapy is loosely linked to the work of Royal Raymond Rife, an American inventor considered to have discovered bioelectric medicine. His theory claimed that viruses would be destroyed if they were introduced to the right balance of resonating frequency, similar to a glass being destroyed by the high pitch of a soprano. Fast forward to the 21st century, when Dr. Mary Staggs applied this theory and others to create the first commercial ionic foot bath in 2001. I decided to try it out for myself with Pacific College Alumna and Oncology Specialist Christine Adamo, LAc, and see for myself what the fuss was all about. Christine is a supporter of \"true\" ionic detoxes and uses them in her practice, particularly with her cancer patients to help with the side effects of chemotherapy. First off, I say \"true\" because Christine warned me upfront about the many false companies out there who claim that the brown water produced in their bath or patch is the result of toxins coming out of the body. \"This is NOT true,\" Christine said. The water changes color naturally because of the chemical reaction between the electricity and the salt water, not because of toxins. So don't be fooled by the infomercials - it's actually the debris that begins to form in the water that are the toxins. Don't just take Christine's word for it - the scientific evidence speaks for itself. \"We can do a test and you can see for yourself if you'd like?\" asked Christine, before we began the detox. \"Why not!\" I said. After all, what better way to determine a treatment's efficacy than with a scientific experiment? We decided to do a urine pH test before the detox and then another pH test after the detox to compare the results. My first pH test showed to be more on the acidic side of normal. I was ready to see if this detox would really change my pH level in just 30 minutes. The main point of these foot detoxes is to make the body's pH more \"alkaline,\" but what exactly is the importance of being alkaline? An alkaline body is crucial to a person's health. Diseases thrive in an acidic environment. So basically, the less acidic your body is and the more alkaline, the less prone you are to contracting a disease, such as osteoporosis or cancer, according to Christine. The Center for Disease Control (CDC) reports that up to 85% of all illnesses are caused by toxins and pollutants in our bodies. The human body functions best when the ions are balanced at 80% negative and 20% positive. So, how do we achieve this? What we put into our body, such as the foods we consume, have either acidic or alkalizing properties. Check out the food charts for yourself here. The more of the higher alkaline foods you can incorporate into your diet the better. It assists the body's natural detoxification process and boosts your immune system. An ionic detox helps to facilitate the alkalization process through the process of ionization, which removes \"free radicals\" from the body. learn about a of PCHS's acupuncture, [massage therapy](/prospective/programs/new-york/massage)or programs](https://www.pacificcollege.edu/nursing). So, the Crucial Question: Did it Work? Does a foot detox bath really draw toxins out of the body system? The pH test said: Yes! My post detox pH levels were right in the middle of the spectrum, as they should be, and noticeably more alkaline than before the detox. Christine says that the detox continues to alkalize the body up to 48 hours after the treatment via urination and sweat, which is an added benefit. One should not eat/drink acidic foods after a treatment, to help better facilitate the detox process. It's important to aid in your body's alkalizing process. \"You can't just come in and 'get fixed.' You have to take ownership of your health. The work I do with a patient has to be part of a team effort,\" Christine said, which is why the food alkalinity chart is so important. Christine suggests bringing it to the grocery store with you to help in purchasing alkalizing foods. Other scientifically measured effects of this detox, besides alkalization, are lower blood sugar levels and lower cholesterol levels. A 2008 study by the Center for Research Strategies showed participants' levels of aluminum to have decreased by 46% and arsenic levels to have decreased by 24% on average. Do Ionic Foot Baths Remove Heavy Metals? Ionic foot detoxes have become increasingly popular as a way to remove potentially toxic elements from the body. The theory is that by soaking your feet in a bath of salt water, you can draw out heavy metals and other toxins that have accumulated in your body over time. While there is some evidence that ionic foot baths can help to remove certain toxins, the jury is still out on whether or not they are effective at removing potentially toxic elements. Some studies have shown that foot detox baths can indeed remove heavy metals from the body, while other studies have been unable to replicate these results. As more research is conducted, we will likely better understand the efficacy of ionic foot detox in removing heavy metals. In the meantime, many people continue using foot detoxes to detoxify their bodies and promote overall health. Why Does the Water Change Color in a Foot Detox? Have you ever wondered why the water changes color when you use a detox foot bath? While the jury is still out on whether or not detox foot baths actually remove toxins from the body, there is a scientific explanation for the color change. When you immerse your feet in the water, the electrical current causes an ion exchange to take place. This means that positively charged ions are attracted to the negative ions in the water, and vice versa. The result is that impurities are drawn out of your body and into the water. So, while there is no definitive proof that detox foot baths are effective, the color change does indicate that something is happening on a molecular level. Is the Ionic Detox Good for Everybody? The ionic detox is a therapy that uses negative ions to cleanse the body of toxins. The ions attach themselves to the toxins and then are flushed out through the feet, which are immersed in a saltwater bath. Most people can benefit from this therapy, as it is gentle and safe. It is especially good for those suffering from gastrointestinal disorders, skin conditions, fungal or yeast infections, and cancer. How Often Should You Detox Your Feet? As any seasoned spa-goer knows, a good foot detox can do wonders for your overall health and wellbeing. But how often should you give your feet a break? The answer may surprise you. While detoxing your feet once a week is generally recommended, some experts say that twice a week is even better. The reason for a regular foot bath is that our feet are constantly exposed to toxins and chemicals. So our feet may benefit from a more frequent detox, which draws toxins from the feet and benefits the entire body. If you often wear high heels or spend a lot of time on your feet, you may want to consider increasing the frequency of your foot detoxes. However, it's important to listen to your body and consult with a professional before making any changes to your routine. With their help, you can find the perfect balance for your individual needs. How Do Ionic Foot Baths Fit Into Chinese Medicine? Ionic foot baths fit into Chinese medicine because they clear heat in the body, just like acupuncture does. Acupuncturists use a variety of modern tools nowadays that weren't invented yet back in ancient Chinese times. Tools besides the ionic detox machine, such as the electrical stimulation machine, work to accompany acupuncture. Both of these tools work with acupuncture to clear heat in the body. The electrical stimulation machine sends electrical impulses through the skin to stimulate the muscles and nervous system, which can help to relieve pain. The ionic foot detox machine is used to cleanse and detoxify the body by using ions. Ions are atoms that have an electrical charge. The machine creates a flow of negative and positive ions through the body, which helps to remove toxins and impurities from the cells. This process can help to improve overall health and well-being. If you want to explore topics such as alternative and traditional Chinese medicine, consider signing up for one of PCHS's programs in acupuncture, massage therapy, or holistic nursing.
