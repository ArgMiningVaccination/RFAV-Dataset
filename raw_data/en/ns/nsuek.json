URGENT was a prospective multicentertrial designed to address these issues.Methods Patients were interviewed within 1 hour of first physician evaluation, in the emergency department or acute care setting, withdyspnea assessed by the patient using both a five-point Likertscale and a 10-point visual analog scale (VAS) in the sitting (60\u00ba)and then supine (20\u00ba) position if dyspnea had not been consideredsevere or very severe by the sitting versus decubitus dyspneameasurement.Results Very good agreements were found between the five-point Likert and VAS at baseline (0.891, P<0.0001) and between changes (from baseline to hour 6) in the five-point Likert and inVAS (0.800, P<0.0001) in acute heart failure (AHF) patients. Lower agreements were found when changes from baseline to H6measured by Likert or VAS were compared with the seven-pointcomparative Likert (0.512 and 0.500 respectively) in AHF patients.The dyspnea at admission, the greater the amplitude ofimprovement in the first 6 hours; this relationship is stronger whendyspnea is measured with VAS (Spearman's rho coefficient =0.672) than with the five-point Likert P<0.0001) in AHF patients. Likert, only nine patients (3% (1%to 5%)) reported an improvement in their dyspnea, 177 (51%(46% to 57%)) had no change, and 159 (46% (41% to 52%))reported worse dyspnea supine compared with sitting up in AHFpatients. The PDA test with VAS was markedly different betweenAHF and non-AHF patients.Conclusions Both clinical tools five-point Likert and VAS showed very good agreement at baseline and between changes frombaseline to tests performed 6 hours later in AHF patients. The PDAtest with VAS was markedly different between AHF and non-AHFpatients. Dyspnea is improved within 6 hours in more than three-quarters of the patients regardless of the tool used to measure thechange in dyspnea. The greater the dyspnea at admission, thegreater the amplitude of improvement in the first 6 hours.P2 Endotracheal intubation in the life and demands a good experience. A preliminary prospectivestudy has shown in one hospital that emergency physicians (EPs)rarely performed ETI. Do the EPs in Ile de France (Paris region)have sufficient experience and regular training to realise thisprocedure safely in the emergency room (ER)?Methods We conducted a descriptive telephone-based question- naire study to assess EPs' endotracheal intubation skills through allERs in Ile de France public hospitals. A questionnaire wascompleted by the investigator during a 10-minute telephone callwith at least one EP in each ER. The structure of hospitals, numberof ETIs performed, devices and personnel available and theexistence of protocols were collected. Their usual practice ofsedation and intubation, training and proposals for changes werenoted.Results The study was made through all of the 64 public hospitals of Ile de France. Fifty-six hospitals have an ICU, 37 a mobile ICU.We questioned 96 EPs; that is, 10% of EPs from our region. All ofthe 96 EPs called responded. These physicians were certifiedemergency physicians (CAMU) for 90% of them. The median ofETI declared was 24.5/year per ER. Thirty-eight percent of EPsperformed less than five ETIs during the past 2 years. The successrate reported was 85%. In 94% of ERs, metallic blades andEischmann mandrin were available and about two nurses can helpduring the procedure. Predictive criteria for difficult ETI cited themost were: short neck, obesity, small mouth opening andotorhinolaryngology disease or previous history of cervicalradiotherapy. Seventy-six percent of EPs followed therecommendations for preoxygenation and 91% performed rapidsequence induction. The vast majority (76%) of ERs did not havestandardized procedures for airway management. Theoreticaltraining was acquired for 46% of EPs by the CAMU, practicaltraining occurring in the operating room for 71%. Among the EPsinterviewed, 87% believe that they should remain the principalactor for ETI - although as high as 89% of them consider that theywere insufficiently trained in ETI management and only 41%pursued continuing medical education on that theme. Seventy-seven percent proposed to spend time in the operating room toimprove their practice of ETI.Conclusions ETI is rarely performed in the ER. It should be part of the EP curricula and written procedures should be made.S2Critical Care March 2009 Vol 13 Suppl 1 29th International Symposium on Intensive Care and Emergency Medicine P3 Radiological validation of endotracheal tube insertion depth in prehospital patients Maybauer1, H Wolff2, E Pfenninger2, W Geisser3 1The University of and TX, USA; 2University Hospital, 13(Suppl (doi: 10.1186/cc7167) Introduction Incorrect positioning of the endotracheal tube (ETT) within the airway after emergent intubation can result in seriouscomplications. contralateral and decreased survival. Conversely, failure to placethe tube several centimeters beyond the vocal cords may result ininadvertent extubation, aspiration, pneumonia, or laryngeal spasm[1]. The aim of this study was to investigate the occurrence of ETTmalpositioning after emergency intubation in the out-of-hospitalsetting.Methods A retrospective study of a 5-year time period, using records of 1,081 patients admitted to the trauma emergency room(ER) at a university hospital. Within 30 minutes after admission, achest X-ray or whole-body CT scan was routinely performed inintubated patients to determine the tube-tip-carina relationship.Results Sixteen out of 1,081 patients died immediately after admission to the trauma ER and were not further radiologicallydiagnosed. Of the surviving 1,065 patients, 346 (32.5%) werefemale and 719 (67.5%) male. In the group of intubatedpatients, 346 (70.9%) were correctly intubated, 89 (18.2%) werenot were 64 patients (14.7%)intubated distance <2 cm, and 25 patients (5.7%)were endobronchially intubated. Chest X-ray scans were notavailable for 53 patients (10.9%). Detailed data on ETT placementwere available in 435 patients; 346 (79.5%) with correct ETTplacement, 89 (20.5%) with incorrect ETT placement. None of thepatients displayed an esophageal or pharyngeal intubation (0%).Of 435 patients, 324 had been intubated (78.4%) were correctly intubated, 70 (21.6%) were notcorrectly intubated.Conclusions This study clearly shows that ETT misplacement in emergency patients is still a serious problem with an incidence of21.6% in our study, of which 5.7% were endobronchiallyintubated. We conclude that the skill level of the operator may bekey in determining efficacy of endotracheal intubation. Based onour findings, all efforts should be made to verify the tube positionwith immediate radiographic confirmation after admission to theER.Reference1. Owen Anesthesiology 1987, 67:255-257. P4 Does bedside chest ultrasound in the ICU improve early diagnosis and quick resolution of pleural effusion? L Tutino1, R Spina2, of 13(Suppl (doi: 10.1186/cc7168) Introduction A bedside chest ultrasound (bCUS) programme performed by intensivists after 18 months of training wasintroduced on a regular basis in a 10-bed emergency ICU from April to November 2008, in order to check its effectiveness in theearly diagnosis and treatment of pleural effusion (PE). The resultshave been compared with those of a control group, when bCUSwas not part of the ICU procedures.Methods The procedure was performed within the first 24 hours after admittance. All of the 92 patients were examined supine, withthe probe perpendicular to the chest wall, using all of theintercostal spaces as the acoustic window. With this technique,once we identified the lung's base, we looked for signs of PEaccording to the following criteria: (a) space between the twopleural layers; (b) variation in the interpleural distance of this spaceduring breathing. For each patient the following data werecollected: age, sex, weight, height, SAPS II, number of chestdrains, number of ultrasound scans performed, number ofsignificant PE (at least 2 cm of width between the two pleurae),amount of ultrasound-guided drainage actually performed withinthe first 24 hours, timing of resolution of PE. Data were comparedwith those of a group of patients admitted to the ICU from Januaryto March 2008, when bCUS was not part of the daily proceduresand only chest CT and X-ray scans were used as evidence of PE.We considered P <0.05 statistically significant. Results A total of 103 bCUS were performed on the first day in the control group, against the 12 bCUS performed in the studygroup. A total of 59 PEs for which drainage proved to be usefulwere found. An amount of 27 pleural drainages were performedwithin the first 24 hours. We have no evidence of complications.All of the positive cases for PE have been successfully treated. Alldrainage was performed within the first 24 hours or at least withinthe first 48 hours.Conclusions Compared with the control group (25.9%), in the study group 45% of drainage performed was done within the first24 hours thanks to the skill of intensivists. As far as PE isconcerned, the introduction of bCUS performed by intensivists inthe ICU daily routine determines an increase of early diagnosis andtreatment. However, the increase in the number of the first-daytreatments was not significant since this procedure is now turningfrom a purely diagnostic approach into an operative one. This willnecessarily need time. P5 Portable chest radiography in mechanically ventilated ICU patients: does synchronizing with end-inspiration improve the quality of films? Cheng1, Tang1, Yip1, K 1North District Hospital, Sheung Shui, Hong Kong; 2Prince of Wales Hospital, The Chinese University of Hong Shatin,Hong KongCritical Care 2009, 13(Suppl 1): P5 quality of portable chest radiographs (CXRs) taken in the ICU is inferior to films taken in the radiologydepartment. The inability of sedated, ventilated patients to holdtheir breath during CXR will also affect the degree of lung inflationand contribute to lack of correlation between serial CXR changesand clinical status [1]. We studied the effect on CXR quality bymanually synchronizing the ventilator to end-inspiration inmechanically ventilated ICU patients.Methods A pair of CXRs was taken after recruiting intubated, ventilated patients within 24 hours of emergency ICU admission.Intubated post-elective surgical patients were excluded due to thehigh likelihood of normal lungs. The control film was taken in theS3Available online http://ccforum.com/supplements/13/S1 usual way, at a random phase of the ventilator cycle. For the synchronized film, the investigator wore a lead apron anddosimeter, stood 1 to 1.5 meters away from the patient, andpressed the inspiratory hold button. The sequence of the pairedfilms was computer-randomized. The ventilator model, settings,patient position and portable X-ray machine settings were keptconstant between films. Patients served as their own controls.Films were independently scored (1 = not clear/poorly inflated, 5 =very clear/well inflated) by two specialist radiologists based on fivecriteria: (i) clarity of lines and tubes, (ii) definition of pulmonaryvasculature, (iii) visibility of mediastinum, (iv) definition of thediaphragm and (v) degree of lung inflation. Linear regression,taking two radiologists' scores of each patient into account, wasused to examine whether there were any differences in the criteriaratings between random and synchronized films. Radiologists andstatistician were blinded.Results We recruited 110 patients; there were no complications from the breath-hold maneuver. Dosimeter readings werenegligible. Synchronized films had higher total scores and meanscores for criteria (ii) to (v), 95% confidence interval. Pvalues were statistically significant: for total score, P<0.001; and for criteria (ii), P= 0.001; (iii), P<0.001; (iv), and (v), P<0.001. Conclusions Synchronizing the CXR to end-inspiration improves the quality of the film and is safe.Reference1. Langevin PB, Hellein V, Harms of radiograph film expo- sure with the inspiratory pause.

P6 Quality assurance report on the use of continuous positive airway pressure and end-tidal carbon dioxide during respiratory distress in field emergency care D Lain1, S Bourn2 1Oridion Capnography, Needham, MA, USA; 2009, 13(Suppl 1): P6 (doi: 10.1186/cc7170) Introduction The use of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is beneficial in the hospital and home care environment. Itis used to support ventilation during neurological disease,ventilatory defects, congestive heart failure and obstructive sleepapnea. Field emergency medicine has inherent complications forthe delivery and monitoring of patients receiving CPAP. Wecompleted an internal quality audit to determine whether CPAPhad benefit and whether capnography could be comfortably usedin parallel with a CPAP device to monitor ventilation.Methods The data collection was completed on patients with respiratory distress. Data were collected pre-CPAP and post-CPAP. Patients were monitored with capnography and pulseoximetry. Emergency Medical Services and Emergency Depart-ment staff evaluated acceptance and ease of use of the equipment.A one-tailed paired test and descriptive statistics were completed.Results Eighteen respiratory distress patients received CPAP: eight female, nine male and one patient had missing data (sex entrywas blank). Mean age was 79 years. Statistical significance wasdetermined at P<0.05. There was no significant difference in heart rate: mean pre-CPAP = 116, mean post-CPAP = 114, P= 0.19. There was a significant improvement in arterial oxygen was a significant improvement in end-tidal carbon dioxide(etCO 2) (ventilation parameter): mean pre-CPAP = 40.1, meanpost-CPAP = 35.1, P = 0.038. There was a significant decrease in respiratory rate: pre-CPAP = 36, post-CPAP = 33, P = 0.031. Using a Borg scale for severity of respiratory distress, there was asignificant improvement after CPAP: pre-CPAP = 8.06, post-CPAP = 5.7, P = 0.0001. The emergency medical technicians found the devices, CPAP, mask, and etCO 2, easy to use, and 16 patients ranked it comfortable. Two patients were uncomfortablewith CPAP. The most comfortable score was 10; the populationscored the overall comfort of CPAP with etCO 2at 7.8. Conclusions CPAP in field emergency medicine can be easily applied, is well tolerated, and results can be monitored bycapnography. Capnographic measurements indicated improvedventilation by a decrease in carbon dioxide. CPAP and etCO 2can be used in field emergencies to support and monitor ventilationduring respiratory distress. P7 Cardiogenic oscillations extracted from spontaneous breathing airway pressure and flow signal are related to chest wall motility and continuous positive airway pressure S Schumann1, F Messmer1, M Lichtwarck-Aschoff2, C 13(Suppl 1): P7 (doi: 10.1186/cc7171) Introduction During mechanical ventilation, signal pulses within pressure and flow curves can be observed that are related to theactivity of the beating heart. From a signal-processing view, thesecardiogenic oscillations (COS) can be understood as repeatedpulses that are transferred via the lungs and airways to the airwayopening. It was demonstrated earlier that COS, achieved duringbreath-holding maneuvers, were influenced by changes inmechanical properties of the thorax [1]. We hypothesized thatthese COS can be extracted from the airway pressure and flowsignal during spontaneous breathing. Furthermore, we hypo-thesized that these isolated signals contain information about themechanical properties of the respiratory system.Methods Fifteen healthy volunteers breathed spontaneously against continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) of 0 to9 cmH 2O at normal thorax or at thorax bending, limiting motility to 90% of the normal circumference. Airway pressure and flow aswell as an electrocardiogram were recorded at a sample frequencyof 200 Hz. To isolate the signals that are related to the activity ofthe heart, pressure and flow data were aligned in time to the R-wave of the QRS complex and averaged.Results Highly characteristic pressure and flow oscillations could be extracted from the spontaneous breathing signals. Both signalswere closely related ( r 2= 0.97 \u00b1 0.02, each P <0.0001). The pressure amplitude of the COS was influenced by CPAP(P= 0.049) and thorax motility ( P <0.001); in influenced only by thorax motility ( P <0.001). Conclusions COS can be extracted from the airway pressure and flow signal during spontaneous breathing. They contain informationabout the mechanical properties of the respiratory system. Afterfurther investigations, our new method potentially allows anestimation of compliance of the respiratory system duringspontaneous breathing.Reference1.

Trachealintubation and invasive ventilation carries some risk and cancontribute to morbidity and possible mortality. Noninvasive positivepressure ventilation (NIPPV) is a mode in which ventilation isapplied without tracheal intubation but via nasal prongs or a facemask. We hypothesized that using NIPPV in infants with pendingrespiratory failure may improve their outcome.Methods In this prospective study, we enrolled infants admitted with pending respiratory failure to the PICU. NIPPV was deliveredusing silicone INCA nasal prongs (Ackrad Labs, Trumbull, CT,USA) connected to an INFANT STAR 950 standard ventilator. TheNIPPV mode of support (continuous positive airway pressure vs.synchronized nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation) wasset to meet patient needs. Vital signs, ventilator settings andlaboratory results were recorded electronically. The primaryoutcome was prevention of invasive ventilation. Secondaryoutcomes were seeking a physiological marker for NIPPV failureand complications from NIPPV.Results Between December 2007 and November 2008, 18 patients (15 infants, three enrolled twice) were eligible to receiveNIPPV based on the attending physician's decision. Median agewas 3 months (15 days to 17 months). Eleven patients had apneaand seven patients had respiratory distress. Among them, fivepatients had bronchiolitis, two had central hypotonia, two hadPertussis and six patients had other miscellaneous respiratoryconditions needing support. Fourteen infants (78%) wereimproved and weaned off NIPPV while four (22%) infants had tobe intubated. The mean length of NIPPV was 47 hours. Nocomplication secondary to the NIPPV was recorded. No single vitalsign or laboratory test predicted whether a patient would improveor fail NIPPV, although the improvement (when happened) wasnoticed within hours of NIPPV. All four failures were due tocontinuum of apnea.Conclusions Our study shows that NIPPV is a safe and successful method to support infants suffering from pending respiratoryfailure. Lacking a physiological or biological marker that coulddistinguish between so-called responders and nonresponders toNIPPV, and the high rate of success in preventing the need forinvasive ventilation, supports our recommendation to trial any infantin pending respiratory failure with NIPPV. P9 Functional respiratory effects of noninvasive ventilation in acute hypercapnic patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease AG Graziani1, B F Morgagni1, (NIV) for improving oxygenation, decreasing hypercapnia, and avoiding invasivemechanical ventilation in patients with chronic obstructivepulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations and acute respiratory failure [1,2]. During the hospitalization, the treatment intensity isquite variable on the basis of the patient's clinical condition. Often,after the acute phase, patients need only periods of NIV followedby oxygenotherapy. NIV reduces the work of breathing andprobably improves the respiratory muscular strength even whenthe ventilation is ended [3]. The aim of this study is to evaluate thiseffect in COPD submitted to NIV.Methods We studied 10 patients (seven male; three female; age 74.2 \u00b1 5.3 years) admitted to our hospital with a COPDexacerbation and acute respiratory failure. After a period of clinicalstabilization, patients underwent spirometry and arterial blood gasas basal examinations. For each patient, NIV was applied for2 hours and than spirometry and arterial blood gas were repeated.Results are presented as mean \u00b1 SD. Data were evaluated bypaired ttest and a value of P<0.05 was taken as statistically significant.Results At the end of NIV, the forced ventilatory capacity (FVC) and the forced expiratory volume at the first second (FEV1)/FVCratio were significantly increased compared with P= 0.007. Compared with the basal results of this study demonstrate that, in COPD exacerbation, NIV determines a decrease of the pulmonaryhyperinflaction. This effect could improve the clinical status and thework of breathing.References1. West JB: COPD. In Pulmonary Physiology ogy. & Wilkins; 2001:33- 53. 2.

However, NIV complicationsand failure are not yet completely understood [1,2]. Our objectivewas to evaluate the indications, complications and failure of NIV inan adult general ICU.Methods From 1 August to 27 October we analyzed prospectively all patients admitted to a 40-bed clinical-surgical ICU of a tertiarycare hospital. From those patients, we included the ones whoreceived NIV (total face mask coupled to a BIPAP Vision \u00aeor Synchrony\u00ae) and evaluated the indications, causes of failure and the complications of this ventilatory support.Results During the study period, 465 patients were admitted to the ICU; 111 patients (23.9%) received NIV. The main indicationsfor NIV were: hypoxemic respiratory failure in 22 patients (19.8%),respiratory infection in 19 (17.1%), acute COPD in 14 (12.6%), asCritical Care March 2009 Vol 13 Suppl 1 29th International Symposium on Intensive Care and Emergency MedicineS5part of a weaning strategy in 16 (14.4%), cardiogenic one (0.9%) others in ninepatients (8.1%). NIV did not avoid intubation in 31 patients(27.9%). The main reasons for failure were: progressive acuterespiratory failure in 23 patients (71.9%) and neurologicaldeterioration in five patients (15.6%). NIV was used after extu-bation in 16 patients, and in five of them (31%) it was necessaryreintubation. The only complication observed was gastricinsufflation in six patients (5.4%).Conclusions NIV is frequently used in a general ICU and the main indication is acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. The NIV failureincidence was significant but similar to the medical literature.References1. Demoule A, et al.: Benefits and risk of success or failure of noninvasive ventilation.

P11 Relative effectiveness of two nasal continuous positive airway pressure devices in VLBW infants: first report from a multicenter, randomized, controlled trial Bober1, J Swietlinski2, Nasal continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP) is accepted as an effective and relatively complication-free methodof respiratory support of premature infants [1,2]. We intended tocompare the effectiveness of two nCPAP devices/approaches(Hudson prongs/bubble (H), and Infant Flow (IF)), in differentgroups of very low birth weight infants in a large trial.Methods Infants weighing 750 to 1,500 g, gestational age <32 weeks, were enrolled from April 2006 to July 2008 at 12centers. The newborns, categorized into three study groups, wererandomly assigned to one of the nCPAP devices in the first 6 hoursof life. Study group A ( n= 119) were neonates placed immediately on nCPAP. Group B ( n= 157) were placed on nCPAP after receiving surfactant. Group C ( n= 56) were treated with conven- tional ventilation and nCPAP was used as the method of weaningfrom mechanical ventilation.Results There were no statistically significant differences between the two devices with regard to treatment success, pneumothoraxor bronchopulmonary dysplasia. The incidence of severe nasalcomplications was lower in the infants treated with Infant Flow: 0.8% (IF), 6.6.% (H) ( 0% (IF), 5.3% (H) ( P= 0.1) in group C. The incidence of necrotizing enterocolitis was also lower in thegroup A infants treated with Infant Flow: 2.5% (IF), 8.3% (H)(P= 0.03). Conclusions ( 1) The two nCPAP methods are comparable with regard to the incidence of pulmonary complications and primaryeffectiveness. (2) The Infant Flow method resulted in fewer severenasal complications.References1. Morley CJ, Davis PG, Doyle birth for very preterm infants. N Engl J Med 2008, 358:700- 708. 2.

P12 Contribution of noninvasive ventilation in the precocious extubation in the medical ICU B Charra, A Hachimi, A Benslama, S 10.1186/cc7176) Introduction During the past decade, noninvasive ventilation (NIV) has imposed itself as an alternative to endotracheal intubation.Several recent studies let us believe that this technique could bealso beneficial at the precocious extubation. The purpose of oursurvey is to value the place of NIV at the precocious extubation inventilated patients.Methods A prospective, randomized and controlled survey has been driven in a medical resuscitation unit during 6 months (Juneto December 2007). After 48 hours of mechanical ventilation (MV),if the patients have no fever, no neurological anomalies norhemodynamic instability and SaO 2>90% with 40% FiO2, a spontaneous breathing trial (T-piece) is performed. If after theT-piece test the clinical status, blood gas and hemodynamic datawere good, the patient was extubated. If these criteria were notfilled, the MV was continued and a daily assessment performed.On the other hand, if the patient was anxious, agitated, withpolypnea >35/minute, PaO randomized for one of thetwo protocols: in the first, the patient was extubated and NIV(pressure support - positive end-expiratory pressure) via a facialmask was performed; in the second, a classic weaning wasperformed with pressure support ventilation. The quantitativevariables are expressed as the average or median \u00b1 standardderivation, and the qualitative variables by as the percentage. Theunivariate analysis was based on the chi-squared test or Fisher testfor the qualitative variables and the Student test for the quantitativeones. P<0.05 is considered significant. The statistic analysis was based on SPSS 11.0 for Windows.Results Twenty-four patients (13 men and 11 women) were enrolled (12 in each group: NIV group and control group). Themean age was 42 \u00b1 2 years. The length of hospitalization for theNIV group is less than that for the control group ( P= 0.001). The weaning of MV was more precocious in the NIV group than in thecontrol group ( P= 0.001). Also, nosocomial pneumonia occurredAvailable online http://ccforum.com/supplements/13/S1S6less in the NIV group than in the control group ( P= 0.04). No case of mortality was noticed.Conclusions It seems that NIV permits one to shorten the duration of MV and length of stay in the ICU at the precocious extubation. P13 Survey of current intubation practices in Polish neonatal and pediatric ICUs J Swietlinski1, J Zejda2, G Brozek2, Musialik-Swietlinska2, M Institute, Warsaw, Poland; 2Medical University Care 2009, 13(Suppl 1): P13 (doi: 10.1186/cc7177) Introduction Guidelines pertaining to the details of intubation practices in neonates and children are not well established. Wesought to describe the current practices with regard to theintubation of newborns and children.Methods The study was performed in 2007. Anonymous question- naires were sent out to all Polish neonatal ( n = 418) and pediatric (n = 45) ICUs. The overall response rate was 65%. The response rate in level III of neonatal care was 86.7% and in the pediatric ICU(PICU) was 65.1%. The responders were asked to provideinformation regarding the frequency of specific practices. Dataanalysis (the difference between neonatal units and PICUs) wasperformed by means of procedures available in SAS software.Results Seventy-four percent of neonatal units and 89.3% of PICUs have a policy for elective intubation. Only a part of the unitshas a written policy (from 48% in level III neonatal ICUs to 19.4%in level I neonatal units). Unplanned extubation was found animportant problem in 3.0% of neonatal units and 7.1% of PICUs(P= 0.05). A written protocol for difficult airways intubation was available in 48.1% of PICUs and 3.0% of neonatal units(P= 0.0001). In total, 92.2% of PICUs have regular sedative practices for elective intubation. Only 44.6% of neonatal units havesuch a policy ( P= 0.0001). Numerous combinations of either sedatives or muscle relaxants were found to be used by units.However the most common policy in neonatal units (69.0%) was asingle dose of midazolam. Combination of thiopental or midazolam,muscle relaxant and/or atropine was used frequently (79.4%) inPICUs. Only 74% of PICUs and 37.5% of neonatal have apolicy for elective extubation ( P = 0.0001). Conclusions When compared with similar studies, a lower number of Polish neonatal and pediatric ICUs have a written policy forelective intubation. Only a minority of PICUs fail to provide anysedation prior to elective intubation. More than one-half of neonatalunits have no such policy despite strong evidence of physiologicand practical benefits. This phenomenon was found also by others.A lack of written guidelines for the extubation procedure is anotherfinding for a future educational programme. P14 Incidence of post-intubation hemodynamic instability associated with emergent endotracheal intubations: a systematic R Green1, B Fergusson2 1Dalhousie University, Canada; 2009, 1): P14 (doi: 10.1186/cc7178) of following emergent endotracheal intubation and the initiation ofpositive pressure ventilation is a potentially life-threatening adverseevent. Unfortunately, the incidence of post-intubation hemo- dynamic instability (PIHI) is relatively unknown. The objective of thisstudy is to estimate the risk of PIHI in adult patients who requireemergent intubation and to identify factors contributing to thelikelihood of this adverse event.Methods This is a systematic review of published adult, inhospital studies of emergent endotracheal intubation. A systematic searchof Medline (1950 to November 2008) and relevant bibliographieswas completed. No restrictions were placed on the language ofpublication, patient diagnosis, indication for intubation, orintubation method employed. One author independently reviewedall citations, and two authors reviewed all candidate articles duringthe process of final selection. Data were independently retrievedon a standardized data abstraction form by two authors. Random-effects meta-analysis was used to estimate the pooled prevalenceof PIHI across studies.Results A total of 22 relevant studies were identified and included in our analysis. One randomized controlled trial and 21 obser-vational studies met the eligibility criteria. Sample sizes rangedfrom 33 to 2,833 patients (median, 214). The prevalence of post-intubation hypotension ranged from 0% to 39%, with a estimate of 8.5% (95% CI, 4.8% to 14.5%).Studies that defined PIHI with a temporal relationship betweenblood pressure reduction and intubation had a PIHI prevalence of13.9% (95% CI, 8.8% prevalence of5.0% (95% CI, 1.6% to 15.0%) in studies that did not.Heterogeneity between studies limits conclusions on the effect ofindication for intubation, intubator experience, medications utilizedto facilitate intubation, and management strategies used for PIHI.Conclusions Post-intubation hemodynamic instability occurs commonly after emergent intubations. Efforts are required toidentify risk factors, and potential preventative and therapeuticinterventions for PIHI. P15 A novel method to develop an elastic, thin-walled, leak-proof, inflatable tracheal tube cuff M Cressoni1, Care 2009, 13(Suppl 1): P15 (doi: 10.1186/cc7179) Introduction Commercially available endotracheal tube (ETT) cuffs are made of PVC polymer that shows little stretch upon inflation,resulting in a need for a cuff diameter larger than the trachea. Suchcuffs form folds, which became a ready passageway for bacteria-colonized subglottic secretions. We developed an elastic andsmooth balloon with no folds upon inflation.Methods In vitro study . Six different ETTs with the newly designed cuff were tested for leakage in a 20 mm internal diameter acrylictube at 20 cmH 2O (1.96 kPa) inflation pressure, pouring 20 ml methylene-blue colored water into the acrylic tracheal tube abovethe cuff to visualize any leak. We observed the ETT cuff for24 hours for possible leakage.In vivo study. Four Yukatan minipigs were intubated with the new ETT cuff and mechanically ventilated for ~40 hours. Methylene-blue colored water was poured into the subglottic space through aline attached to the ETT. We looked for blue discoloration ofmucus retrieved during the tracheal suction at 5, 10 and30 minutes following instillation. At tracheal mucosa wasexamined for possible cuff-related damage.Results The Lycra cuff was devoid of folds upon inflation, and touched the wall of the mock trachea. There was no leakage ofCritical Care March 2009 Vol 13 Suppl 1 29th International Symposium on Intensive Care and Emergency MedicineS7methylene-blue colored water. Instead, the average leakage across the cuff 12.2 \u00b1 ml/hour ( P<0.0001 vs. the Lycra and We observed no methylene-blue in tracheal secretions. The pigtrachea appeared normal at autopsy, with no signs of erosion.Conclusions We showed that a new concept, a smooth ultrathin elastic tracheal tube cuff, can perform better than presentcommercially available tracheal tubes. P16 Abstract withdrawn P17 Influence of tracheostomy on duration of weaning from mechanical ventilation S Dubrov, F Glumcher National O.O. Bogomolets Medical 2009, 13(Suppl 1): P17 (doi: 10.1186/cc7181) Introduction There several advantages of tracheostomy if compared with orotracheal intubation, such as a more comfortablestate for the patient, more effective aspiration of the sputum ofrespiratory ways, reduction of respiratory way resistance andavailability of peroral nutrition. These advantages also include moresafe maintenance of the passableness of respiratory ways,reducing the terms of carrying out respiratory support and thepatient staying in the ICU, decreasing the pneumonia developmentrisk. This study is designed to compare the duration of weaning inpatients with tracheostomy versus patients suffering orotrachealintubation.Methods For this observational prospective cohort study, multiple trauma patients requiring more than 72 hours of mechanicalventilation were prospectively selected. A group of patients thatunderwent early tracheostomy before weaning attempts (ET) werecompared with a group of patients that underwent weaningattempts while being orotracheally intubated. Tracheostomy wasperformed for these patients only in case there were severalunsuccessful attempts of weaning (forced tracheostomy) lastingmore than 7 days (FT). The general patient state was estimated bythe APACHE II score, traumatic damages have been estimated bythe injury severity score, and the degree of infringement ofconsciousness has been estimated by the GCS.Results Seventy-one patients meeting the inclusion criteria were subject to our trial. The ET group included 41 patients thatunderwent tracheostomy lasting 2 to 5 days from the moment ofmechanical ventilation being started. The FT group consisted of 30patients and tracheostomy was performed for 60% of them. Bothgroups of patients were statistically comparable. The medianduration of mechanical ventilation was shorter in the ET group ofpatients (256 vs. 314 hours, P= 0.047). The median duration of weaning was also shorter in the ET group of patients (61 vs.103 hours, P= 0.008) if compared with the FT group. In total, 34.1% of patients of the ET group suffered pneumonia, while in theFT group the percentage was 50% ( P= 0.032). The mortality rate was almost the same in both groups ( P= 0.944). Conclusions Results of this study show that early tracheostomy, if performed for patient's suffering severe combined trauma, reducesthe duration of weaning. Early tracheostomy results in a decreaseof the frequency of complications such as ventilator-associatedpneumonia. The duration of tracheostomy did not affect themortality rate of the investigated groups of patients.P18 Safety of percutaneous tracheotomy in patients with cricoid cartilage not identified: report of 122 cases T Adanir, A Sencan, M Aksun, A Atay, G Aran, N Karahan Ataturk tracheotomy (PT) is one of the most frequent procedures carried out in critically ill patients. However, itcarries contraindications in the patient group younger than16 years of age, in cases with known or anticipated difficultendotracheal intubations, in infection of surgical areas and in caseswith cricoid cartilage not identified. In this retrospective study, weevaluated the safety of performing the PT-associated bluntdilatational exploration with a right-angle clamp in patients havingcricoid cartilage not identified.Methods We reviewed retrospectively the data of 122 PTs in patients having cricoid cartilage not identified due to obesity orpostural deformity, between January 2006 and October 2008. Thedata obtained from charts included age, sex, timing of PT, durationof the procedure, minor or major complications and mortality. All ofthe procedures were performed at the bedside in the ICU. After asmaximal a positioning of the patient as could be performed, localanesthetic infiltration was applied to 1 to 2 cm superior of thejugular notch of manibrium sterni (according to the structure ofpatient's neck). After incision (~2 cm) of skin and subcutaneoustissue, all layers of subcutaneous tissue were passed through untilfeeling the trachea by finger using a right-angle clamp (bluntdilatational exploration). So, cricoid cartilage was directly palpatedby the tip of the finger, and the attempt (Griggs technique) wasperformed between the first and second tracheal cartilages belowthe cricoid cartilage.Results The patients were mechanically ventilated for an average of 12.9 \u00b1 2.6 days. They were 57 \u00b1 14 (26 to 86) years old, and64 of them were female, 58 of them were male. The duration of thetechnique was 2.5 to 5 minutes. There was no death or cardiacarrest related to tracheotomy. There were 113 PTs (92.6%)documented as uncomplicated. There was no technically difficultprocedure, and none of the patients changed into a surgicalapproach during the procedure. However, major hemorrhagedeveloped during first 24 hours in eight patients. In one patient,pneumomediastinum was determined in the 48th hour after theprocedure. The overall complication ratio was established as 7.4%.Conclusions PT associated with using a right-angle clamp seems to be safe; it could be performed in the patients having cricoidcartilage not identified. P19 Percutaneous dilational tracheostomy: early and late complications RM Corso, Fabbri, M Terzitta, P Gudenzi, tracheostomy (PDT) is a common procedure in ICU patients. In this study we evaluatedperioperative complications. Moreover we looked for late compli-cations by telephone interview together with a clinical evaluation inthe suspected cases.Methods We included 170 consecutive patients admitted to GB Morgagni Hospital ICU, between June 2005 and June 2007 whounderwent PDT. Demographic data, clinical data and severityAvailable online http://ccforum.com/supplements/13/S1S8scores (SAPS II), data about the tracheostomy technique and tracheostomy major complications were collected. We used theCiaglia technique with endoscopic guidance throughout theprocedure. Twelve months after discharge, we traced andinterviewed our patients about possible late complicationsconnected with the tracheostomy. Symptomatic patients werereferred to the ENT specialist for fiberoptic laryngoscopy control.Results PDT was performed in 170 patients as a routine procedure by intensivists. The main primary indications for PDTwere weaning failure (29%) and neurological dysfunction (71%).One hundred and five patients were male and 65 female, with anage average of 68 \u00b1 15 years. The mean SAPS II was 53 \u00b1 10points. The intubated time before PDT was 5 \u00b1 2 days and thetime in the ICU after PDT was 14 \u00b1 8 days. The ICU mortality was16%. Placement was successful in all cases. The total incidence ofmajor complications was 1.18%: a simple pneumothorax success-fully treated with chest tube insertion and one early (after 72 hours)cannula displacement evolved to cardiorespiratory arrest anddeath. We traced 38 patients alive 12 months after discharge; 22patients answered the telephone interview. None complained ofrespiratory symptoms, Four patients described symptoms thatwere considered worth further examination and were invited to anENT control. In two patients, swallowing uncoordination wasfound. In another two patients, a 20% tracheal stenosis was found.The stenosis was, however, asymptomatic.Conclusions In our experience PDT had an overall low rate of major complications (1.8%). Only one patient had severe earlycomplication. We did not find severe late complication. In selectedpatients, PDT with endoscopic guidance guarantees a high 2. Christenson Tracheostomy analysis of 443 procedures A Marb\u00e1n, J L\u00f3pez University Hospital La Paz, Madrid, SpainCritical Care 2009, 13(Suppl 1): P20 (doi: 10.1186/cc7184) Introduction The aim of this study is to analyse our experience with tracheostomies performed in the critical care unit of a tertiaryuniversity hospital.Methods A retrospective clinical records review of patients who underwent this procedure in a 7-year period.Results From January 2001 to December 2007, 6,333 patients were admitted to our unit; 1,528 needed mechanical ventilation(MV) for more than 48 hours and 443 underwent tracheostomy.The median age was 56 years (14 to 88 years); 66% were male.The median APACHE II score was 20 (4 to 44). The maindiagnoses were polytrauma including head injury in 24.2%, otherstructural neurological in 35%. The techniquewas used in the majority of cases (90%). The mean duration of MVprior to tracheostomy was 13.8 days (SD = 6.4). The overallcomplication rate was 6%. Intraprocedural complications wereatelectasis (0.4%) and bleeding (2%). Two of patients neededsurgical control or transfusion (0.4%). Two stoma infectionsdeveloped in the open tracheostomy group. The most frequentcomplication was tracheal stenosis, encountered in 15 patients (3%). The ICU mortality was 20.7%. Of the 351 patientsdischarged from the ICU, 45.8% were decannulated prior todischarge from the ICU and 31% in the ward; 23% of them couldnot be decannulated at any moment. Ward mortality in the group ofpatients decannulated in the ICU was 5%, 10% in the patientsdecannulated in the ward and 37% in those who faileddecannulation, for a total of 50 deaths before hospital discharge(11%). The main diagnoses of the patients who died on the wardwere: residual encephalopathy in 62% (postanoxic, posttraumaticor other causes), severe chronic respiratory failure in 10%, spinalcord injury in 6%, and neuromuscular disease in 4%.Conclusions We had a low rate of early complications, similar to other series, with no procedure-related deaths [1]. Our maincomplication was airway stenosis. As in other studies, patientswho needed a tracheostomy belonged to a group of patients with ahigh severity and mortality. Some of them do not recover asatisfactory neurological and functional status to be decannulatedand present a high ward mortality.Reference1. D\u00edaz-Rega\u00f1\u00f3n G, Mi\u00f1ambres E, Ruiz A, and 1): P21 (doi: 10.1186/cc7185) Introduction patients often elective tracheostomy for prolonged ventilatory support, control of intra-cranial pressure as sedation is weaned and for impaired pharyn-geal and laryngeal reflexes. The possibility of raised intracranialpressure, worsened by patient positioning and intraproceduraloccult hypercarbia, makes it a higher risk procedure [1]. There islittle information on the timing of percutaneous dilational tracheo-stomy (PDT) or periprocedural complications in neurointensivecare patients.Methods Out of 80 patients who underwent PDT over a period of 1 year, information was obtained and analysed on 52 patients.Baseline demographical information collected included the date ofadmission, date of PDT, level of the operator, supervision, andperiprocedural complications. We also looked at the use of post-procedure chest radiography (CXR). Analysis was then carried outto determine the timing of PDT, the incidence of complications andthe use of CXR.Results Fifty-two patients were included, median age 56 years (range 20 to 79 years). The procedure was carried out either bytwo trainees with a consultant supervising (40%) or by a consul-tant and a trainee (57%). Two patients who had a difficultanatomical approach had the procedure done by two consultants.The timing of PDT ranged from 1 day to 22 days with a mean of7.69 days and SD of 4.29 days. There were only three reportedcomplications (5%), none of them major or involving raisedintracranial pressure. CXR was requested in 68% of cases; of the35 patients who did have CXR, only 51% had recorded reports inthe notes.Conclusions In spite of recommendations that CXR is not required following uncomplicated PDT, most operators still request one, ahabit that leads to unnecessary patient and staff exposure toradiation. The majority of the PDTs was performed by trainees inCritical Care March 2009 Vol 13 Suppl 1 29th International Symposium on Intensive Care and Emergency MedicineS9our unit, and the low complication rate proves that the technique is safe and easy. PDT in neurointensive care patients carries a higherrisk, but with proper patient selection and senior input theprocedure is as safe as in general intensive care patients.References1.

P23 Risk factors for unplanned extubation in critically ill patients RI De Groot, LP Aarts, MS Arbous Leiden Unplanned extubation (UE) is a frequent complication in ICU patients associated with increased morbidity, mortality,duration of mechanical ventilation, ICU stay and hospital stay.Although UE has been studied, still not much is known on theincidence, determinants and outcome. The aim of the study was toassess the incidence and determinants of UE in a tertiary-care ICU.Methods From 1 December 2005 to 1 June 2008 a prospective case-control study was undertaken. Cases were consecutive adultpatients in a 29-bed medical, surgical, neurosurgical, and thoracic-surgical ICU who experienced an UE. The UE was defined aspremature removal of the tube by the patient. For each case, fourcontrols were randomly selected. Controls were mechanicalventilated patients who did not experience an UE at the time acase occurred. Demographics and clinical characteristics wereobtained from the electronic medical records. Wilcoxon rank-sumand chi-squared tests were used as appropriate. To determineindependent risk factors for UE, univariate logistic regression wasused. Determinants significant in the univariate analysis wereincluded in the multivariate logistic regression. This model wastested for the clinically relevant interaction between determinants.Results In the study period, 74 UEs occurred and 296 controls were collected. The incidence of UE is 2.1% for mechanicallyventilated patients and 0.4% per ventilation day. Cases andcontrols did not differ significantly with respect to age, type ofadmittance or diagnosis category. Forty-seven percent of thecases had to be reintubated, 77% did not experience anothercomplication. Cases had significantly lower median length ofintubation (5 vs. 7 days, P= 0.069), ICU mortality (18 vs. 27%, P= 0.096) (19 vs. predictors of UE in the multivariate analysis wereadmittance to the thoracic surgery unit (OR = 2.63, 95% =1.06 to 6.53, P= 0.037) and score of 1 30.57, 95% CI = 3.18 to 294.2, P= 0.003), 2 25.47, 95% CI = 3.00 to 217.0, P= 0.003), and 3 (OR = 7.02, 95% CI = 0.78 to 63.01, P= 0.082) compared with the most sedated score. Protective factors are female gender (OR = 0.55, 95% CI = 0.26to 1.19, P= 0.131), and use of midazolam at the time of UE (OR = 0.44, 95% CI = 0.19 to 0.99, P= 0.048). Conclusions Although UE can be defined as a complication we could not find a correlation with morbidity and mortality.

In 2001 a taskforce of pulmonary andcritical care experts developed guidelines for weaning andAvailable online http://ccforum.com/supplements/13/S1S10discontinuation of mechanical ventilation that recommended the development and implementation of respiratory weaning protocolsfor nonphysician healthcare professionals in the ICU [1]. Ourweaning protocol was established in 2005 based on clinicalevidence and best-practice recommendation at the time. Theprimary aim of this audit is to ascertain the extent of protocoladherence in our unit. The secondary aims include correlation ofprotocol-driven weaning to outcome as defined by successfulextubation and reduction in the length of mechanical ventilation.Methods A prospective study of all patients who received mechanical ventilation over a 1-month period, excluding patientswho had tracheostomy insertion and patients who had theirtreatment withdrawn. We looked at the rate of compliance with ourweaning protocol, the reason for noncompliance and outcome.Results Fifty-two patients were included, 18 protocol-driven and 34 nonprotocol-driven weaning. The most common reason fornonprotocol weaning was clinical decision (40.4%). In total, 19.2%of patients had an alternative spontaneous breathing trial from theprotocol and were counted as nonprotocol. There were nodifferences in the rate of successful extubation between patientswho were weaned from protocol versus nonprotocol, 94.4% vs.79.4% respectively (Fisher's exact test P = 0.236). Duration of ventilation was also similar in the protocol and nonprotocol groups,mean \u00b1 SEM = hours (unpaired ttest P = 0.699). The overall success rate of extubation was 86.5%. Conclusions Our compliance rate is 34.6%, and the protocol- driven weaning trial does not improve outcome in our unit.However this could be due to the small sample size, the timing ofthe study and a nondiscriminatory protocol.Reference1.

Chest 2001, 120(6 Suppl): B is a 10-bed intensivist-led unit in a 500-bed teaching hospital. We compared our paper-based nurse-drivenweaning protocol [1] with SmartCare in a prospective cohortstudy. All consecutive patients receiving mechanical ventilationbetween May and October 2008 and fulfilling the inclusion criteriawere included. Patients were included if the intensivist on his twicedaily rounds considered the patient ready for withdrawal of theventilator and if patients were on pressure support with no morethan 50% oxygen and no more than 8 mbar positive end-expiratorypressure, had no fever, had a normal pH, were arousable and hadno more than 5 g/kg/min dopamine. Patients were excluded if they were ready for immediate extubation or if they had atracheostomy. For the first 3 months of the study, patients wereallocated to the paper-based nurse-driven weaning protocol, andfor the last 3 months to SmartCare.Results The results are presented in Tables 1 and 2. Normally distributed data are presented as the mean and SD, nonparametricdata as the median and interquartile range. Thirty-two patients were enrolled in the study.

P26 Respiratory muscle saturation S Benito, E 13(Suppl 1): P26 (doi: 10.1186/cc7190) Introduction Unnecessary prolongation of mechanical ventilation is related to increased morbidity. On the contrary, early discon-tinuation of mechanical ventilation with reintubation is also relatedto bad prognosis. High respiratory rate, cardiac load and neuro-muscular dysfunction are known factors related to weaning failure.Oxygen tissue saturation (StO 2) obtained by near-infrared spectro- scopy (NIRS) reflects the balance between oxygen delivery andconsumption at the muscle level. StO 2evolution during weaning may have a role in assessing respiratory muscle performance andhelp us to predict patient readiness to be weaned. The studyobjective is to describe respiratory muscle StO 2during a T-tube test.Methods A patient with mild head injury and pulmonary contusion was submitted to a T-tube trial after obtaining stability on day 5.The NIRS signal from serratus anterior muscle was acquired byplacing an Inspectra device probe on the skin surface of theCritical Care March 2009 Vol 13 Suppl 1 29th International Symposium on Intensive Care and Emergency Medicine Table 1 (abstract P25) Baseline characteristics Paper SmartCare (n= 17) ( n= 17) P value Age 70.5 (9.4) 62.4 (13.8) 0.07 t test APACHE II score 13.7 (5.2) 13.5 (4.4) 0.90 ttest Days ventilated 3 (2 to 4) 3 (2 to 4) 0.97 Mann-Whitney U test Table 2 (abstract P25) Results Paper SmartCare (n= 15) ( n= 17) P value Wean time (hours) 4.5 2.6 0.007 (2.8 to 21.3) (1.8 to 3.6) Mann-Whitney U test 0/15 Fisher exact Simultaneously, respiratory rate, heart rate, mean arterial pressure and arterial oxygen saturation were recorded.

P27 Early and continuous weaning from mechanical ventilation without formal protocols in a university hospital K Lam, J Walker Royal Liverpool University Hospital, Liverpool, UK Critical Care 2009, 13(Suppl 1): P27 (doi: 10.1186/cc7191) Introduction There is evidence that formal weaning protocols can reduce the duration of mechanical ventilation (MV) and compli- cations of prolonged unnecessary ventilation [1]. In our ICU we do not employ a formal protocol, but have a standard practice where patients with spontaneous respiratory efforts on pressure- controlled ventilation (PCV) have a trial of assisted spontaneous breathing (ASB). Patients on ASB with pressure support 10 cmH2O will then have a trial of unassisted continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) with high-flow oxygen. Methods A retrospective audit was conducted on 47 patients in a 13-bed general medical and surgical ICU of a university hospital. The length of time between first spontaneous breaths while on PCV and a trial of ASB was recorded. The length of time from achieving pressure support 10 cmH2O on ASB to a trial of unassisted CPAP was recorded. A retrograde step was defined as going back on to PCV from ASB, or to ASB from unassisted CPAP. If the trial of weaning was repeated within 12 hours of aretrograde step, this was noted as a continuous attempt at weaning. Similar data were collected for subsequent retrograde steps. Results The median duration of MV from initiation to discontinuation was 85 hours (range 1 to 345 hours), with a median time of 37 hours (range 1 to 245 hours) on PCV and 32 hours (range 0 to 264 hours) on ASB. The median time from recorded spontaneous breaths on PCV to ASB was 1 hour (range 0 to 34 hours). Twenty-nine (62%) patients on PCV progressed on ASB without any retrograde steps. The median time from having pressure support 10 cmH2O on ASB to unassisted CPAP was 2 hours (range 0 to 41 hours). Thirty-one (66%) patients on ASB progressed on CPAP without any retrograde steps. Forty-one patients (87.2%) had a first attempt to wean from PCV to ASB and 40 patients (85%) from ASB to CPAP within 10 hours of eligibility. Maximum delay in initiating first attempts to ASB was 34 hours, and 41 hours to CPAP. Reasons for retrograde steps included respiratory instability ( n= 19), signs of poor tolerance or haemo- dynamic instability on ASB/unassisted CPAP ( n= 18) and inter- ventions, for example bronchoscopy, imaging, theatre, and so forth (n= 13). Conclusions The median duration on MV in our unit compares favourably with a large randomised controlled trial with a similar patient population [1]. Most patients had their first attempt to wean within 10 hours from eligibility. A significant number of patients may have weaned more quickly if a formal protocol was in place. Reference 1.

P28 Ventilator dependency among obese in the ICU CL Jessen, KM Larsen Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus Care 2009, 13(Suppl 1): P28 (doi: 10.1186/cc7192) Introduction The purpose of this study was to evaluate the dependency for mechanical ventilation among morbidly obese patients (MOP) defined by BMI 40 kg/m2, admitted to our ICU. Because of reduced functional residual capacity, increased risk of atelectasis, increased work of breathing and decreased compliance of the lungs and chest wall [1], MOP are expected to have a high dependency of mechanical ventilation. Early tracheo- tomy has a beneficial outcome in a medical population of patients admitted to the ICU [2], and one should assume benefits of early tracheotomy in MOP because they are at high risk of pulmonary complication. A subject of debate as a study has shown morbid obesity associated with increased risk of complications [3]. Methods All MOP admitted for more than 24 hours in a 12-bed mixed ICU at a Danish university hospital in the period of 2007 and 2008 were retrospectively included. The ICU stay was registered as well as airway management, length of mechanical ventilation and time for tracheotomy after intubation. Results Twenty-one morbidly obese patients were admitted. Fifteen patients (71.4%) needed mechanical ventilation. Three of these patients had a period of noninvasive ventilation. The median duration of ventilation was 13 days (range 4 to 71 days) and median length of stay was 16 days (range 4 to 71 days). Eleven patients were tracheotomised after a median 7 days (range 1 to 11 days). Six patients had no need for mechanical ventilation. Their median length of stay was 3 days (range 1 to 12 days).

Only onepatient died in the ICU.Conclusions A high proportion of MOP admitted to our ICU needed mechanical ventilation (71.4%) and a very high proportionwas tracheotomised. Further studies are needed to evaluate thebeneficial effects of early tracheotomy in this patient group.References1. Marik P, et al.: The obese patient in the ICU. Chest 1998, 113:492-498. 2.

Comparison novel humidifier with two conventional humidifiers during high-frequency oscillatory ventilation J N drying of the airways and mucous plug formation can be compli-cations associated with inadequate humidification. This studycompares water vapor delivery of a standard passover humidifierand a conchatherm humidifier typically used during HFOV with anovel principle of The Sensormedics 3100B oscillatory ventilator (Cardinal Health, Yorba Linda, CA, USA) was connected to a test lung at thefollowing settings: mean airway pressure, 30 cmH 2O; power, 6.0; inspiratory time percentage, 33%; frequency of 6 Hz and bias flow30 l/min on room air. The 3100B was run at the above settings firstusing five different MR850 passover humidifiers (Fisher & Paykel,Auckland, New Zealand), followed by five different Hydrate OMNIs(Hydrate Inc., Midlothian, VA, USA) and then five differentConchaTherm Neptunes (Teleflex Medical, Research Triangle Park,NC, USA). The gas temperature and relative humidity wererecorded continuously using an electronic hygrometer/thermo-meter (SHT75; Sensirion, Staefa, Switzerland) two circuitconfigurations: (1) between test lung/patient wye (triangularplastic connector that connects the inspiratory and expiratory limbsof the circuit with the patient endotracheal tube) and (2) distal to acondensation tube placed between the test lung/patient wye. Thecondensation tube served to approximate the upper airways in ourlung model and collect the condensate. Water condensate was collected over a 30-minute test period for each run. All humidifierswere set to 37\u00b0C.Results See Table 1. Conclusions In this model, the Hydrate OMNI provided the highest absolute humidity during HFOV. The difference wasamplified at the end of the condensation tube. Further study onhumidification during HFOV is warranted. P30 A new in vitro model for force measurements at the isolated entire rat diaphragm C Armbruster, K Gamerdinger, M Schneider, S Schumann, H P30 (doi: 10.1186/cc7194) Introduction Several diseases of different origin as well as pro- longed mechanical ventilation result in diaphragmatic dysfunctionand atrophy. To date most in vitro experiments on the mechanics of diaphragm muscles are performed at isolated muscle strips. Sincethe improvement of the knowledge about the diaphragmfunctionality is lacking in view of the position and curvature, amodel of the whole diaphragm appears necessary. Here wepresent a new in vitro model of an isolated whole rat diaphragm inside a bioreactor [1].Methods The bioreactor consists of a pressure chamber on which a highly flexible membrane is attached. A rat diaphragm is fixed onthis membrane. By application of a gas volume into the pressurechamber, a defined deflection of the diaphragm is achieved. Thehighly flexible membrane adapts a given shape thus allowing thediaphragm to take up its in vivo profile. Electrical stimulation results in a contraction of the diaphragm. These diaphragm-twitchesgenerate pressure pulses inside the pressure chamber. Ratdiaphragms were excised rapidly and kept at room temperature inKrebs-Henseleit solution bubbled with oxygen. By application ofone of two different initial pressures (P1: 7 mbar; P2: 12 mbar) thediaphragms were set to a defined degree of deflection. Using aplatinum wire electrode, the diaphragms were electricallystimulated at impulses of 6V. The stimulation train duration was setto 500 ms or 1 second. The pulse duration was set to 50 ms at afrequency of 50 Hz. The pressure pulses resulting as the responseon muscle contraction were measured inside the pressurechamber.Results An increase of the initial pressure led to an increased pressure caused by the muscle contraction. An enlarged muscleregeneration time led to an increase of the diaphragmatic twitch-induced pressure.Conclusions Our new in vitro model of an isolated whole rat diaphragm allows the performance of mechanical and physiologicalinvestigations on the entire diaphragm. A dependency of pressuredevelopment of the diaphragm on its deflection state could bedemonstrated. Furthermore, we found effects of diaphragm musclefatigue. Our new model could be used in numerous types ofinvestigations, such as releasing factors of diaphragmatic dysfunc-tion or respiratory muscle fatigue.Reference1.

However, prolonged mechanical ventilation results in the complete absence of neural activation and mechanical activity of the diaphragm and has been shown to induce ventilator-induced diaphragmatic dysfunction (VIDD) [1]. Few studies have shown that maintaining spontaneous ventilation could prevent VIDD in in vitro animal studies [2]. Adaptive support ventilation (ASV) is an automatic ventilation mode that allowed pressure-controlled breaths in active patients able to trigger. The aim of our study was to compare ASV with controlled ventilation (CV) without paralysing agents on diaphragmatic contractile properties in an in vivo piglet study. Methods Two groups of six anesthetized piglets were ventilated during a 72-hour period. Piglets in the CV group ( n= 6) were ventilated without any spontaneous ventilation and piglets in the ASV group ( n= 6) were ventilated with the possibility of triggering spontaneous ventilation. The main endpoint was the transdiaphrag- matic pressure (Pdi) (after bilateral, supramaximal, transjugular stimulation of the two phrenic nerves), which represents the in vivo contractile function of the diaphragm. A force-frequency curve was drawn after stimulation from 20 to 120 Hz of the phrenic nerves. Results The piglets in the ASV group were maintained with spontaneous ventilation during 80% of the study period instead of less than 1% in the CV group. At 72 hours, Pdi was decreased by 35% in the CV group although it was not modified in the ASV group (Figure 1). Conclusions Spontaneous breathing with ASV prevents VIDD in comparison with totally CV in an piglet model.References L, Mosoni L, Roszyk L, V, et al. : Pressure support ventilation attenuates ventilator-induced protein modifications in the diaphragm.

P32 Characterization of the mechanical ventilator adjustment process H Al-Otaibi, J Hardman, R Mahajan The University of Nottingham, UK Critical Care 2009, 13(Suppl 1): P32 (doi: 10.1186/cc7196) Introduction The aim of the present study was to gain insight into the mechanical ventilator adjustment process, particularly events that prompt clinicians to adjust the ventilator, the indications, considerations, and methods used to assess the successfulness of the adjustment episode. Methods A prospective, observational, noninterventional study was conducted in a 24-bed adult, medical and surgical intensive care unit at a regional hospital. Patient demographics, ventilator adjustment episodes, and clinical decisions related to these adjust- ments were collected. Clinicians were asked to complete a ventilator flowsheet before and after any ventilator adjustment episode. Simultaneously, they were asked to complete an open- ended questionnaire related to the process of ventilator adjustment episode. Results A total of 168 ventilator adjustment episodes derived from 26 mechanically ventilated patients were evaluated. Among these episodes, the ventilator mode was adjusted 33 times (20%), the minute volume 37 times (22%), the positive end-expiratory pressure 19 times (11%), the pressure support 21 times (12%), and the fraction of inspired oxygen 61 times (36%). Triggers which stimulate the process of mechanical ventilator adjustment were categorized into: routine ventilator checks (35%), routine arterial blood gases (ABG) (20%), weaning trials (13%), and calls from nurses (9%). The most common indications to adjust the ventilator were hyperoxygenation (28%) and weaning trials (26%). Peripheral oxygen saturation, ABG, and level of consciousness were the most common considered variables during the process of ventilator adjustment. In 42% of the total adjustment episodes, clinicians did not consider any technical, physiological or psychological variable while they adjusted ventilator parameters. Clinicians based their decisions to adjust ventilator settings on clinical experience (72%), trial and error (15%), protocols (11%), and scientific equations (2%). Clinicians assessed their decisions via ABG results (47%), peripheral oxygen saturation (23%), and general patient assessment (9%). Conclusions The process of ventilator adjustment is mainly stimulated by routine ventilator checks and ABG. ABG and weaning trials are the most common indications. Most ventilator adjustment decisions are based on clinical experience, evaluated via ABG and peripheral oxygen saturation.Available online http://ccforum.com/supplements/13/S1 Figure 1 (abstract P31) Pdi evolution during the study.

S14P33 Impact of a dedicated ventilatory support team on how mechanical ventilation is employed in a tertiary-care hospital F Saddy, A Thompson, R Serafim, F Gago, N Charris, J Pantoja Copa D`Or, 2009, 13(Suppl 1): P33 (doi: 10.1186/cc7197) Introduction Advances in our knowledge of the pathophysiology of respiratory failure have forced major revisions of our approach to ventilatory support. We describe how mechanical ventilation is employed in four different ICUs (surgical, clinical, cardiac and neurological) of a tertiary-care Brazilian hospital where a ventilatory support team composed of intensivists is responsible for a daily- basis follow up. Methods A prospective observational study enrolled all invasive mechanically ventilated patients admitted to four ICUs from May 2004 through June 2008. Daily recorded data included: demographics, diagnosis, modes of ventilation, tidal volume/kg (Vt), positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) level, peak inspiratory pressure, plateau pressure (Pplat), recruitment maneuvers, use of sedation and neuromuscular blocking agents (NBA), tracheotomy, barotrauma, ventilation days, and length of stay (LOS) in the ICU. Results are expressed as the mean \u00b1 SD and percentage. Differences were assessed by one-way ANOVA followed by the Tukey test. P<0.05 was considered significant. Results A total of 1,715 patients was studied. Diagnosis prevailed depending on the ICU's characteristics. Ventilatory data are depicted in Table 1. Recruitment maneuvers were used in less than 2% of patients. The most frequent type of ventilatory mode was spontaneous ( P<0.05). Barotrauma was similar in less than 0.63% ( P>0.05). Intravenous sedation was administered for no more than 40% of the time on mechanical ventilation. NBA was used for no more than 0.25% of patients. LOS and ventilation days were different among ICUs ( P<0.05).

P34 Hyperoxia in mechanically ventilated patients S Bolton, E Pugh, A Hay, S McKechnie Royal Infirmary Edinburgh, UK Critical Care 2009, 13(Suppl 1): P34 (doi: 10.1186/cc7198) Introduction Supplemental oxygen is part of the supportive treatment of hypoxaemic respiratory failure. Prolonged exposure to high fractions of inspired oxygen (FiO2) has been shown to be injurious to the lung in vitro [1]. The optimal paO2in critical illness has not been established but the clinical impression is that patients are frequently exposed to a higher FiO2than is necessary. The aimof this study was to investigate current oxygen treatment in patients undergoing prolonged mechanical ventilation and determine whether this resulted in exposure to a higher FiO2than that required to adequately oxygenate haemoglobin (SaO2>95%). Methods Indices of oxygenation were collected for 30 patients requiring mechanical ventilation >2 days. Data were collected 4-hourly for 48 hours. The PaO2:FiO2ratio was determined for each data point and used to model the theoretical FiO2required to maintain an SaO2of 95% (paO2= 10.7 kPa). Results The results are shown in Figure 1. Data are expressed as medians (IQR). The median observed FiO2was 0.4 throughout the study whereas the median FiO2, calculated to maintain an SaO2of 95%, was 0.3. Conclusions Our data demonstrate that critically ill patients may be exposed to a higher FiO2than that required to maintain adequate oxygenation. Further, these results highlight an area of ICU care that has received little study, with no published clinical trials examining the effect of FiO2on outcome. Reference 1.

MS Moeng Johannesburg Hospital, Houton, Johannesburg, Africa Critical Care 2009, 13(Suppl 1): P35 (doi: 10.1186/cc7199) Introduction Johannesburg Hospital is a level I trauma center in Gauteng. We routinely do chest X-rays (CXRs) in indicated cases, if feasible, and prefer to perform a CXR after intercostal drain (ICD) insertion to maintain quality and direct further care [1]. Methods A prospective data collection of patients who had injuries that required the insertion of an ICD over a period of 8 months from 1 August 2006 to 30 March 2007. A questionnaire was developed and it included the patients' demographics, mecha- nism of injury, reason for ICD insertion, findings of both the initial and post-ICD insertion CXR, change in management and any acute complications noted. Results One hundred and forty patients were identified for the study, 129 (92.1%) were males and 11 (7.9%) were females. The average age was 32 (range 11 to 64) years. Eighty-four (60%)Critical Care March 2009 Vol 13 Suppl 1 29th International Symposium on Intensive Care and Emergency Medicine Figure 1 (abstract P34) S15patients sustained stab wounds and 20 (14.3%) had gunshot wounds. The remaining 36 (25.7%) sustained blunt injury. Onehundred and four (74.3%) patients had an ICD inserted for bothradiological and clinical findings, while 19 (13.6%) patients haddrains inserted due to radiological findings and 14 (10%) patientson clinical grounds only. Three (2.1%) patients had drain insertionafter CT scan findings.In patients who had an initial CXR, clinical and/or radiological find-ings confirmed 47 (36.7%) patients with haemopneumothoraces,49 (38.3%) patients with pneumothoraces, 26 haemothoraces and four (3.1%) patients had significantsurgical emphysema with fractures and two (1.6%) patients had noabnormalities on CXR. No acute complications to chest tubeinsertion were noted.In 89 (63.6%) patients, the post-ICD CXR showed good positionof the drain with improvement in pathology, in 31 (22.1%) patientsan inadequate ICD position was noted, in 17 (12.1%) patientssignificant retained haemothoraces were shown and in three(2.1%) patients poor lung expansion was detected. The post-ICDCXR contributed to change in management in 29 (20.7%) of thecases. Twenty-two (15.7%) patients required a change in positionof the tube, six (4.3%) had surgery performed, and one (0.7%)patient had their conservative treatment escalated. Four (2.9%)patients should have had their tubes adjusted.Conclusions Routine usage of post-ICD CXR contributes to a change in management in one out of five trauma patients.Reference1.

P36 Bedside chest ultrasound reduces the rate of chest X-ray and CT examinations R Spina1, L Tutino2, A Di Filippo2, L Teaching 13(Suppl 10.1186/cc7200) Introduction A bedside chest ultrasound (bCUS) programme performed by intensivists after 18 months of ultrasound trainingwas introduced in the ICU routine between April and November2008 in order to evaluate its effects on the number of chest X-ray(CXR) and CT scans. The setting was a 10-bed emergency ICU.Methods From April to November 2008 every patient has undergone a bCUS within the first 48 hours since admittance, thenbetween the fourth and the sixth days of their stay. All of the 92patients were examined supine, with a convex probe perpendicularto the chest wall, using all the intercostal spaces as the acousticwindow. From the lung base, every intercostal space has beenexamined, looking for a pleural effusion, attaining to the followingcriteria: a space between the visceral and parietal pleura,movement of that space in agreement with the respiratory pattern.As for the volume esteem of the effusion, the distance (mm)between the posterior part of the lung and the posterior chest wallwas measured. For each patient the following data were collected:age, sex, weight, height, SAPS II, number of CXR and CT scansdone. Data were compared with those of a group of patientsadmitted to the ICU from January to March 2008, when bCUS wasnot part of the daily procedures. P<0.05 was considered statistically significant.Results The two groups of patients were statistically homogeneous. Comparing the control group with the study group,CXRs were reduced by 22.63% (from 433 to 335; P= not signi- ficant) and CT scans were reduced by 42.36% (from 144 to 83; P <0.05).Conclusions The use of daily routine bCUS is useful to reduce the traditional radiology requests. The decrease of CT scans isstatistically relevant. As far as CXR requests are concerned, thedecrease does not appear significant since the CXR is relativelyeasy to perform and it is mandatory after radiopaque devicepositioning. These amount to 34% of the total CXRs performed. P37 Combination of variability with pressure support ventilation enhances lung protection and function in experimental acute lung injury M Gama de Abreu1, PM Spieth1, AR 13(Suppl 1): P37 (doi: 10.1186/cc7201) Introduction Protective ventilation with low tidal volumes became the standard of care in acute lung injury (ALI). Although spon-taneous breathing activity may be beneficial even in early ALI,protective ventilation is usually performed as controlled ventilation.Theoretically, pressure support ventilation (PSV) may be advan-tageous over pressure-controlled ventilation (PCV), particularly ifcombined with variability in the form of noisy PSV [1,2].Methods Two protocols (A and B) were performed in pigs (20 to 30 kg). Animals were anesthetized, intubated, mechanically venti-lated and ALI was induced by surfactant depletion. In protocol A,animals ( n= 12) were randomly assigned to a sequence of PCV, PSV and noisy PSV, being ventilated for 1 hour in each mode(crossover design). The distribution of lung aeration and perfusionwere determined. In protocol B, animals ( n= 24) were randomly assigned to 6 hours of mechanical ventilation with PCV or PSV ornoisy PSV, and lungs were extracted for quantification ofinflammation and lung damage. In both protocols, gas exchangeand respiratory parameters were determined. Statistical analysiswas performed with univariate and multivariate tests, as appro-priate. Significance was accepted Results Compared with PCV, arterial oxygenation, intrapulmonary shunt, mean airway pressure and elastance of the respiratorysystem were improved by PSV and further improved by noisy PSV.Also, noisy PSV reduced the work of breathing and respiratorydrive compared with PSV. Lung damage and inflammation werereduced by assisted mechanical ventilation, but comparablebetween noisy PSV and PSV. The distribution of lung aeration didnot differ among the three modes, but PSV and noisy PSV wereassociated with more redistribution of pulmonary blood flowtowards better aerated ventral areas compared with PCV.Conclusions The combination of variability with PSV enhances lung protection and function in experimental ALI. The mainmechanism of improvement of lung function by assistedmechanical ventilation using pressure support is not recruitment ofdorsal areas, but rather redistribution of pulmonary blood flow toventral zones.References1.

Most patients have to beventilated mechanically to provide adequate oxygenation. Reductionof tidal volumes as low as 6 ml/kg adjusted bodyweight has beenconvincingly shown to reduce ARDS and mortality in the ARDSnettrial [1] and is now recommended in treating such patients. In theARDSnet trial, body weight has been calculated by a formulaimplementing the body height [1]. We suggest that in most patientson ICUs the correct height is not known or is at best estimated, butvery seldom correctly measured. We searched for both an easily ob-tainable and reproducible body mark to correctly predict body height.Anthropological and forensic data have shown a close correlationbetween the ulna length and body size. We prospectively measuredbody height and right and left ulna length in ventilated ICU patients.Methods In a 2-month period, 39 men and 42 women from four ICUs in a teaching hospital were included consecutively (mean age62 years, range 23 to 87 years). Body height was measuredfollowing a standardized protocol, ulna length was measured fromthe edge of the olecranon to the caput ulnae.Results Eighty-one patients were included. Thirty-nine men: height 145 to 199 cm (mean 178.5 cm), right ulna 25 to 32 cm (mean28.3 cm), left ulna 24.5 to 32 cm (mean 28.3 cm). Forty-twowomen: height 142 to 185 cm (mean 165.7 cm), right ulna 21 to29 cm (mean 25.0 cm), left ulna 21 to 28 cm (mean 24.9 cm).Regression analyses were made in SAS 9.1 and showed asignificant correlation between the body height (men and women)and the length of the ulna. Regression analyses for men: bodyheight in cm = 3.9314 (right ulna; in cm) + 67.059 cm(r 2= 53.25%; SD = 6.79) and body height in cm = 3.9786 x (left ulna; in cm) + 65.824 cm ( r2= 52.50%; SD = 6.84). Regression analyses for women: body height in cm = 4.88 x (right ulna; in cm)+ 43.76 cm ( r 2= 55.53%; SD = 6.61) and body height in cm = 5.41 x (left ulna; in cm) + 30.95 cm ( r2= 60.67%; SD = 6.21). Conclusions Ulna length is an easily obtainable estimate of total body height. It may aid in implementing low-tidal-volume ventilation.Anthropological data correlate reasonably with a contemporaryventilated ICU population. Whether ulna-derived estimates of bodyheight may improve adherence to established guidelines has to bestudied.Reference1.

Lung and pleural effusion were outlined separately; lungtotal weight and pleural effusion volume were computed withdedicated software. A PEEP test at 5 and 15 cmH 2O with constant minute ventilation was performed. Exclusion criteria were:age <18 years, hemodynamic instability, chronic obstructive pul-monary disease and evidence of barotrauma.Results We enrolled 11 ALI/ARDS patients (10 male). The mean clinical characteristics on admission to the ICU were: age 67.5 0.048.

Repartition of gas and tissue probably influences theresponse to a recruitment maneuver (RM), but to date there is noproof. The aim of this study was to assess RM-induced changes inlung morphology and gas exchange during and after RM in acuterespiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) patients.Methods Nineteen patients with ARDS were included in the study. Patients were ventilated with volume control ventilation (Gallileo;Hamilton Medical, Bonaduz, Switzerland) with Vt = 6 ml/kg (idealbody weight) and respiratory rate to keep PaCO 2>55 mmHg without intrinsic PEEP. After a first CT scan in zero end-expiratorypressure conditions, a pressure-volume curve was performed andthe PEEP was set above the lower inflection point. After astabilisation period, a second CT scan (in PEEP) was performed.Then a RM was performed, using continuous positive airwaypressure 40 cmH 2O for 40 seconds. At the end of the RM (between 35 and 39 s) a third CT scan was performed. Fiveminutes after the RM, a fourth CT scan was performed in PEEPconditions (same level of PEEP). Blood gas analysis was sampledat each step of the study. CT-scan analysis was performed usingspecific volumetric software (IRMA).Results Ten men and nine women, 63 \u00b1 11 years old, were included in the study. SAPS II was 44 \u00b1 8. Nine presented anonlobar CT-scan attenuation and eight a focal loss of aeration. Allpatients presented early ARDS (onset between ARDS diagnosticand study inclusion was 18 \u00b1 11 hours). Setting PEEP 2 cmH 2O above the lower inflection point increased PaO2/FiO2from 167 \u00b1 110 to 205 \u00b1 72 mmHg ( P <0.001), and 265 \u00b1 80 mmHg after the RM ( P <0.005 vs. PEEP) and 273 \u00b1 96, 5 minutes afterCritical Care March 2009 Vol 13 Suppl 1 29th International Symposium on Intensive Care and Emergency MedicineS17the RM.

We aimed to evaluatethe effects of PEEP and ARM on respiratory mechanics and lungtissue in an inhaled hydrochloric acid acute lung injury (ALI) model.Methods Thirty-two pigs (22.9 \u00b1 2.8 kg), were randomly allocated into one of four groups (I - Control-PEEP, II - Control-ARM, III -ALI-PEEP, IV - ALI-ARM). ALI was induced by intratrachealinstillation of hydrochloric acid. PEEP values were progressivelyincreased and decreased from 5, 10, 15 and 20 cmH 2O in all groups. Three alveolar recruitment maneuvers of 40 cmH2O for 20 seconds were applied to the assigned groups at each intervalof PEEP level increase or decrease. Histological analysis wasmade to evaluate the presence performed to determine alveolar dimensions.Results Inflammation and alveolar disruption were statistically greater in group II when compared with group I. There were nostatistical differences between groups III and IV with respect tohemorrhage, alveolar edema, inflammation and alveolar disruption.Mean alveolar area and mean alveolar intercept were higher ingroup IV when compared with groups I and II ( P <0.05). The mean alveolar area was significantly smaller in the diaphragmatic lobeswhen compared with other middle and upper pulmonary lobes, butno statistical difference was found among groups.Conclusions The association of PEEP with ARM promoted a greater degree of alveolar disruption.Acknowledgement Nieman GF: Positive end-expiratory pressure after a recruitment maneuver prevents both alveolar col-lapse and recruitment/derecruitment.

Postoperative hypox-emia carries high morbidity leading to prolonged postoperativerecovery and hospital stays. We hypothesized that adding high posi-tive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) would be effective for treatmentof postoperative hypoxemia after cardiac surgery with cardiopul-monary bypass, independently of the mode of ventilation or the useof nitric oxide.Methods During 2 years, 210 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass with pump surgery after diagnosis of hypoxemia (PO 2/FiO2 <200) were randomized into six groups after operation (35 in eachgroup): pressure-controlled ventilation (PCV) with inhaled nitricoxide and ideal PEEP (group 1), PCV without inhaled nitric oxideand ideal PEEP (group 2), PCV without inhaled nitric andPEEP 5 cmH 2O (group 3), volume-controlled ventilation (VCV) with inhaled nitric oxide and ideal PEEP (group 4), VCV withoutinhaled nitric oxide and ideal PEEP (group 5) and VCV withoutinhaled nitric oxide and PEEP 5 cmH 2O (group 6). Arterial and mixed venous blood were drawn and analyzed before the interven-tions, 1, 2, 4 and 6 hours after the interventions in the ICU to deter-mine the PaO 2/FiO2ratio. Hemodynamic measurements were analyzed. The time to extubation was compared among groups,accordingly to the ICU weaning protocol.Results There was no significant difference among the groups regarding hemodynamic measurements (mean arterial blood pres-sure, heart rate, central venous pressure and SVO 2). Oxygenation was higher in both high-PEEP groups (groups 1, 2, 4 and 5) thanin the PEEP 5 groups (groups 3 and 6) during the mechanical ven-tilation period ( P<0.01). Also, the time to extubation was signifi- cantly lower in high PEEP groups than in the PEEP 5 groups (220min vs. 428 min, P<0.03). Conclusions Ventilation with high PEEP after cardiac surgery is associated with improvement of oxygenation and less time ofmechanical ventilation independently of the mode of ventilation andof the use of nitric oxide.References1.

P43 Control system for automated titration of positive end-expiratory pressure and tidal volume using dynamic nonlinear compliance as the setpoint S Lozano-Zahonero1, A Wahl2, P43 (doi: 10.1186/cc7207) Introduction An automated respiratory mechanics control was developed to individually adapt the energy transfer from theAvailable online http://ccforum.com/supplements/13/S1S18ventilator to the respiratory system. The controller titrates the positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and tidal volume (VT) to ventilate the lung at its maximal compliance in order to avoid excessive lung overinflation as well as underinflation. Methods The mechanics controller consists of a software program to set PEEP and VT and a user interface to observe the compli- ance and the controller state. The program has following structure: (1) Dynamic compliance is calculated breath by breath using the implemented slice function [1]. This function divides VT into six consecutive volume slices of equal size. (2) For each volume slice, one value of dynamic compliance (CSLICE) is determined by least- squares fit using the linear resistance and compliance model within each slice [2]. The six CSLICE values are plotted over the corresponding volume, giving the compliance-volume curve. (3) The shape-compliance function of the controller identifies one out of six shape categories [3]. (4) The PEEP and VT-change function calculates the PEEP and VT titration depending on the shape category and sends a command to the ventilator for setting the new PEEP and VT automatically. Results The system was tested with previously recorded patient data (McRem) [4]. The compliance controller retrospectively analysed the respiratory data and determined the shape category depending on the course of CSLICE. For shapes representing an intratidal increase of CSLICE, the controller increased the PEEP. A reduction of PEEP occurred when CSLICE decreased intratidally. PEEP was maintained when CSLICE was maximal and constant. Furthermore, for hybrid shape categories (one part in the linear region and one part in the increasing and/or decreasing region) the VT was reduced. Conclusions The automated respiratory mechanics control system titrates PEEP and VT automatically until intratidal compliance reaches its maximal value within an appropriate VT. References 1.

P44 Effect of positive end-expiratory pressure on regional ventilation monitored by electrical impedance tomography in mechanically ventilated ICU patients D Gommers, IG Bikker, J Bakker Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam, the Netherlands Critical Care 2009, 13(Suppl 1): P44 (doi: 10.1186/cc7208) Introduction The optimal positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) is a balance between the prevention of overdistention in the nondependent part and alveolar collapse in the dependent part. Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) has been introduced to monitor regional change of ventilation at the bedside. We evaluated the effect of changes in PEEP on regional ventilation in mechanically ventilated patients with or without lung disorders.Methods Functional EIT (fEIT) images were obtained in 14 patients on pressure-controlled ventilation with constant driving pressure at four PEEP levels (15, 10, 5 and 0 cmH2O). fEIT images made before each reduction in PEEP were subtracted from those recorded after each PEEP step to evaluate the regional increase/decrease in tidal impedance in each EIT pixel. Results The response of regional tidal impedance to PEEP showed a significant difference from 15 to 10 cmH2O (P = 0.002) and from 10 to 5 cmH2O (P = 0.001) between patients with and without lung disorders (Figure 1). During the decrease in PEEP from 15 to 10 cmH2O, tidal impedance increased in the ventral parts in both groups, but decreased markedly in the dorsal parts in the patients with lung disorders. From PEEP 10 to 5 cmH2O, tidal impedance increased in the ventral parts and decreased in the dorsal parts in patients without lung disorders, whereas in patients with lung disorders tidal impedance decreased in both regions. Lowering the PEEP from 5 to 0 cmH2O decreased tidal impedance in both regions in both groups. Conclusions During a decremental PEEP trial, EIT can visualize improvement or loss of ventilation in dependent and nondependent parts, indicating lung collapse or decreased overdistention. P45 Measurement of the end-expiratory lung volume without interruption of mechanical ventilation in pediatric patients IG Bikker, T Scohy, D Gommers Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam, Critical Care 2009, 13(Suppl 1): P45 (doi: 10.1186/cc7209) Introduction Monitoring the end-expiratory lung volume (EELV) is a valuable tool to optimize respiratory settings that could be of particular importance in mechanically ventilated pediatric patients. We evaluated the feasibility and precision of an ICU ventilator with an inbuilt nitrogen washout/washin technique in mechanically ventilated pediatric patients. Methods Duplicate EELV measurements were performed in 26 patients between 5 and 30 kg after cardiac surgery. All measurements were taken during pressure-controlled ventilation at 0 cmH2O positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). Results Linear regression between duplicate measurements was excellent ( R2= 0.99). Also, there was good agreement between duplicate measurements, bias -1.0% (-1.7 ml) \u00b1 5.7% (15.5 ml) (Figure 1). The mean EELV was 18.9 \u00b1 4.4 ml/kg at 0 cmH2O PEEP. The EELV correlated significantly with age ( P<0.001,Critical Care March 2009 Vol 13 Suppl 1 29th International Symposium on Intensive Care and Emergency Medicine Figure 1 (abstract P44) S19r= with an inbuilt nitrogen washout/ washin EELV technique can measure EELV with precision, and can easily be used for mechanically ventilated pediatric patients. P46 Success of recruitment maneuvers during pneumoperitoneum is dependent on the intraabdominal pressure H Runck, S Schumann, J Haberstroh, J Guttmann University Medical 13(Suppl 1): P46 (doi: 10.1186/cc7210) Introduction Intraabdominal hypertension is a condition affecting respiratory mechanics in many situations such as laparoscopy or morbid obesity. We investigated the effects of different intra- abdominal pressures (IAP) at different positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) levels on nonlinear respiratory mechanics and the effects on hemodynamics and oxygenation in a rat model. The application of a pneumoperitoneum served as a model for elevated IAP. Methods A helium pneumoperitoneum was established in 20 anesthetized female Wistar rats that were randomly allocated to one of four PEEP levels (0, 3, 6 and 9 mbar). IAP of 9, 12, 15 and 18 mbar was instilled in a random sequence in each rat, followed by respiratory mechanics measurement and blood gas analysis. From the low flow maneuvers' pressure-volume loops, the lower inflection point and the mathematical turning point within the expiratory limb were detected and compared with the IAP applied during the measurement. For investigation of the lung's intratidal compliance, 10 consecutive breaths before and after low flow maneuvers were analyzed. Intratidal nonlinear compliance was calculated using a modified SLICE method [1]. Results A higher IAP led to a decreased steepness of quasi-static pressure-volume loops resulting in a right shift of the expiratory lower inflection point. The pressure at the mathematical turning point of the expiratory limb correlated well with the IAP ( r= 0.97, P<0.001). Intratidal compliance decreased with increasing IAP before and after the low flow maneuvers. After execution of the low flow maneuvers the compliance increased. Relative compliance gain caused by the low flow maneuvers was dependent on PEEP, IAP and slice (all P<0.001). The peak inspiratory pressure increased with increasing IAP and was significantly smaller after recruitment maneuvers ( P <0.001). The peak inspiratory pressure was dependent mechanics. IAP has no effect on oxygenation as long as PEEP is applied. The examination of nonlinearity holds important information for the evaluation of respiratory mechanics. The success of recruit- ment maneuvers on healthy lungs depends strongly on the IAP. Reference 1.

P47 Correlation between lung sound distribution and functional residual capacity: preliminary findings S Lev, YG Glickman, IK Kagan, JC Cohen, PS Singer Care 2009, 10.1186/cc7211) Introduction Vibration response imaging (VRI) is a bedside lung sound monitoring system. The VRI measurement has been proven sensitive to changes in ventilator settings, including changes in the mode of mechanical ventilation or in positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). In the present study, we correlate lung sound distribution with functional residual capacity (FRC). Methods Thirty-nine lung sound measurements were performed on seven mechanically ventilated critically ill patients at different levels of PEEP before and after recruitment maneuver. The FRC was obtained for each measurement. Lung sound distribution was monitored using the sound distribution index (SDI), an index revealing the lung sound distribution at peak inspiration and computed from the percentages of lung sound distribution in four lung segments (right lower (RL), left lower (LL), right upper (RU), left upper (LU)) as SDI = 100 - abs(RL + LL - RU - LU) / 2 - abs(RU + LU - RL - LL) / 2 (range 0% to 100%). P values were obtained using the Wilcoxon two-sample test. Results Significantly increased mean (\u00b1 SD) SDI was registered in cases with higher FRC. In two out of five measurements with FRC above 2.9 l, a low SDI was obtained (~70%). Conclusions Lung SDI significantly increased with FRC. At very high volumes, a decreased SDI may indicate possible hyperinflation. P48 Clinical utility of functional residual capacity measurement based on a modified nitrogen breath washout technique F Turani1, R Barchetta1, F Mounajergi1, A Falco1 1European Hospital, Rome, Italy; 13(Suppl 1): P48 (doi: 10.1186/cc7212) Introduction Improvement of oxygenation during acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) requires a high level of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) to recruit nonaerated lung zones and decrease pulmonary shunt. However, monitoring of alveolar recruitment at the bedside is difficult, as neither the PaO2/FiO2ratio, thoracopulmonary compliance or generation of pressure curve are indices of alveolar recruitment and avoidance of lung hyperinflation. Monitoring of the functional residual capacity (FRC) at the bedside may be useful to monitor directly lung recruitment and to optimize the PEEP level [1]. The aims of this study are to evaluate the FRC by a modified nitrogenAvailable online http://ccforum.com/supplements/13/S1 Figure 1 (abstract P45) S20multiple washout technique (NMBW) in ALI/ARDS patients, and to set PEEP levels on data of FRC values. Methods Twenty patients with ALI/ARDS were enrolled in the study. All patients were ventilated in pressure-controlled ventilation with an Engstrom carestation ventilator (GE Healthcare, Helsinki, Finland) in accordance with the ARDSnet guidelines. FRC measurement was carried out with the COVX module integrated within the ventilator (GE Healthcare) by a NMBW technique. Every patient had a basal FRC measurement and then three measurements at PEEP 15/10/5 cmH2O during a derecruiting maneuver. After all measurements, PEEP was set as the PEEP at which value FRC started to decrease. At basal time (T0) and after setting the best PEEP (T1) the PaO2/FIO2 ratio and static compliance were measured too. All data are reported as the mean \u00b1 SD. A ttest was used to compare changes during time. Results Table 1 presents the main results of the study. Table 1 (abstract P48) Conclusions FRC measurement by the NMBW technique integrated in the ventilator is useful to assess functional lung impairment at the bedside. Setting PEEP on FRC measurements may improve lung recruitment and oxygenation, but anatomical studies (CT scan) are also warranted. Reference 1.

P49 Pulmonary permeability index predicts progression to acute lung injury in patients with increased risk CR Phillips, K Bacon, J Pinney, A Nielsen, JL LeTourneau OHSU, Portland, 2009, 13(Suppl 1): P49 (doi: 10.1186/cc7213) Introduction Early identification of progression to acute lung injury (ALI) in patients at risk may change therapy and potentially improve outcome. Central to the pathogenesis of ALI is pulmonary micro- vascular injury and increased permeability resulting in pulmonary edema. We proposed that the pulmonary vascular permeability index (PVPI) (extravascular lung water (EVLW) (ml) / pulmonary blood volume (PBV) (ml)) reflects the severity of this injury and predicts progression to ALI in patients at risk. Methods The PVPI was measured prospectively in 27 patients who either were at increased risk to develop ALI ( n= 17) or who had ALI on presentation ( n= 10) for the first 5 days after admission to the ICU. Results Ten out of 17 patients at risk for ALI progressed to it. The mean (\u00b1 SEM) PVPI on day 1 was lower in patients who did not develop ALI vs. those that did (1.4 \u00b1 0.1 vs. 2.6 \u00b1 0.4, P= 0.01) in the 17 patients who did not have ALI on presentation (Figure 1). There was no difference in PVPI for those that developed ALI vs. those that had it on presentation (2.6 \u00b1 0.4 vs. 2.7 \u00b1 0.3, P= 0.5). A cutoff PVPI value of 1.9 or less discriminated those that would not develop ALI from those who did or who had it on presentation with a sensitivity and specificity of 100% and 85%, respectively (Figure 2).Conclusions Increased PVPI is a feature of early ALI and predicts progression to ALI in patients at increased risk. Early identification of patients with elevated PVPI and who are at risk to develop ALI may lead to consideration of early initiation of lung protective ventilator strategies. P50 Pulmonary electrical impedance tomography changes in a model of hemorrhagic shock with endotoxemia and resuscitation 1): P50 (doi: 10.1186/cc7214) Introduction Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) is a promising bedside device with the potential to assess changes in regional ventilation and lung blood flow [1]. The purpose of our study was to monitor lung images and changes in impedance by EIT in a model of hemorrhagic shock with endotoxemia followed by fluid resuscitation. Methods Twelve anesthetized, mechanically ventilated, supine pigs were submitted to hemorrhagic shock (50% blood volume) and endotoxin infusion. Animals were randomly allocated to controlCritical Care March 2009 Vol 13 Suppl 1 29th International Symposium on Intensive Care and Emergency Medicine Figure 1 (abstract P49) Figure 2 (abstract P49) S21(n= 6) or a treatment group with lactated Ringer's ( n= 6). The mean arterial pressure (MAP), central venous pressure (CVP), blood gas, extravascular lung water index (EVLWI), intrathoracic blood volume index (ITBVI), lung compliance and pulmonary EIT (Dr\u00e4ger, Germany) were measured before shock (Tbasal), 60 minutes after hemorrhagic shock (Tshock) and hourly in the treatment period (T1, T2and T3). Statistical analysis was based on one-way ANOVA (P<0.05). Results In Tshock there was a significant decrease in MAP, CVP, SvO2, lung compliance, cardiac index, EVLWI and ITBVI and an increase in lactate ( P<0.05). Fifty percent of control animals died between T2and T3. In treated animals, at T3the EVLWI reached values near those of Tbasalwhereas ITBVI remained below baseline (P <0.05) and above Tshock (P<0.05). There was sensible change in functional EIT images (Figure 1) and significant differences in impedance along time. Significant global impedance change occurred in T2relative to Tshock (P<0.05). Most of the EIT changes were attributable to the ventral lobes (local1), which showed significant differences of T1, T2and T3relative to Tshock (P<0.05). Conclusions Pulmonary impedance changes induced by the proposed model of shock and resuscitation were monitored successfully with the EIT device. Changes were suggestive of alterations in regional ventilation and ventilation-perfusion mismatch. Acknowledgement Grants from FAPESP 08/50063-0, 08/50062-4 Crit Care 2007, 13:344-350. P51 Determination of lung area in electrical impedance tomography images Z Zhao1, K M\u00f6ller2, (doi: 10.1186/cc7215) Introduction Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) has the potential for bedside monitoring of regional lung function. Evaluation of EIT imaging requires the identification of the lung area in the images. A functional EIT-based method (fEIT) has been proposed to identify the lung area in EIT images for patients with healthy lungs [1,2]. However, in patients with certain lung diseases, the fEIT method will fail to include those lung regions where a low ventilation change is present. Besides, identified lung regions may include the cardiac-related area. A method to estimate the lung area accurately is missing. The aim of this study was to develop an improved method for lung area estimation in EIT images (LAE), which is suitable for both healthy subjects and patients with serious pulmonary diseases. Methods In our LAE method, the lung area as determined by fEIT is mirrored and the cardiac-related area, which is distinguished inthe frequency domain, is subtracted. Forty-nine mechanically ventilated patients were investigated (test group: 39 patients, thoracic surgery; control group: 10 patients, orthopedic surgery without pulmonary disease). An EIT video sequence of 5 minutes duration comprising about 60 breathing cycles from every participant was recorded and subsequently analyzed. Statistical analysis was performed by one-way ANOVA. P<0.01 was considered statistically significant. Data are presented as means and standard deviations. Results It is assumed that the fraction of the lung in the thorax for different people should be more or less in the same range, in spite of the state of the lung. The sizes of the lung area determined with fEIT are in control group S_C, fEIT = 361 \u00b1 \u00b1 60.8 ( P <0.01). On the contrary, the sizes estimated with the LAE method are in control group S_C, LAE = 353 \u00b1 27.2 and in test group S_T, LAE = 353 \u00b1 61.1 ( P = 0.41). Conclusions The result demonstrates that the novel LAE method can better access the lung region in EIT images, from which the analysis of regional lung ventilation will benefit. Further validation will be pursued by comparing the results with anatomic computed tomography image of the chest morphology. References 1. Hahn G, et al .: Physiol Meas 17(Suppl 4A): A159- A166.

P52 Development of a system for in vivo optical D Schwenninger1, 10.1186/cc7216) Micromechanical properties of alveolar walls are needed for finite element modeling of the lung that in turn may be used to guide mechanical ventilation therapy. The aim of this project is to develop an endomicroscopic device [1] to measure the local mechanics of alveolar walls in vitro and in vivo under varying conditions. Here we report on the development and the evaluation of the endoscopic system, which is - on the first run - performed in an artificial environment (bioreactor) with known mechanical properties. Methods A system of two concentric trocars was built to adjust and monitor the local pressure by means of a flushing fluid in the endoscopic field of view. The fluid is pumped through the double trocar system that is surrounding the endoscope. By adjusting the flow rate of the fluid, the mean pressure P2 in the endoscopic field of view, can be kept constant. The alveolar pressure is changed by adjusting the airway pressure P1. The transpulmonary pressure (Pt) for the observed subpleural alveoli is thus Pt = P1 - P2 (Figure 1b). Pt is varied by applying different continuous positive airway pressure values to animal-model airways. The mechanical reaction of the observed alveoli is, thereby, recorded by video endoscopy. Assuming that the recorded outlines reflect changes in the diameter of an observed alveolus allows calculation of mechanical properties such as the stress-strain relationship of the alveolar wall. For evaluation, the endoscopic system is applied to an artificial membrane with known mechanical properties in a bioreactor. A pattern of particles on the membrane allows quantifying the three-dimensional deformation under pressure changes. Mechanical membrane properties can be determined by the relation between membrane-deformation and transmembrane pressure Pm = Pa - Pb (Figure 1a).Available online http://ccforum.com/supplements/13/S1 Figure 1 (abstract P50) Functional EIT images along timepoints. S22Results Preliminary results were obtained in the bioreactor with a polymer membrane (polydimethylsiloxan) of 100 m thickness. Graphite particles were used to produce a particle pattern. Deformation due to different Pt was observed and recorded successfully. Conclusions The in vivo estimation of micromechanical properties such as the stress-strain relationship of elastic walls is feasible. For that, the developed system has to be technically optimized.

P53 Effects of inhaled iloprost on acute respiratory distress syndrome in prone and supine positions E Senturk1, N Cakar1, P 1University of Istanbul, Turkey; 2Hannover Medical School, Germany Critical Care 2009, 13(Suppl 1): P53 (doi: 10.1186/cc7217) Introduction In several studies it has been shown that inhaled pulmonary vasodilators (NO and iloprost) can decrease the pulmonary hypertension and also improve the oxygenation during acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [1]. We investigated the effects of prone and supine positioning on the effects of inhaled iloprost in an animal-ARDS model. Methods After approval of the animal ethics committee, 10 pigs were anesthetized and intubated. Invasive systemic and pulmonary arterial catheterizations were performed (T1). ARDS was induced in all animals with the infusion of oleic acid (0.15 to 0.30 ml/kg). The study design is shown in Figure 1. Hemodynamic and respiratory parameters and ventilation parameters were measured; arterial and mixed venous blood samples were drawn; and were recorded in T1 to T6. Pigs were ventilated in volume-controlled ventilation mode with FiO2100%, with 4 cmH2O positive end- expiratory pressure (PEEP) in the beginning and with 8 cmH2O PEEP after induction of ARDS. Statistical analysis was made with Student's ttest, repeated measures of ANOVA (with Tukey as the post-hoc test) and paired ttests. P <0.05 was significant. Results There was no significant difference between the sequences. Iloprost decreased the mean pulmonary arterial pressure in both supine (37 vs. 31 mmHg) and prone (38 vs. 29 mmHg) positions significantly, but there was no significant difference between both positions. Prone position was associated with an improvement in oxygenation compared with supine position both with or without iloprost application. There was no spillover effect of iloprost. Conclusions Iloprost decreased pulmonary arterial pressures in both positions. On the other hand, the prone position improved oxygenation. The decrease in pulmonary arterial pressures and improvement in oxygenation was better in prone position + iloprost; however, these findings were not statistically significant. Reference 1.

Vascular endo- thelial growth factor (VEGF) role in endothelial destruction and angiogenesis [3]. The expression of VEGF in ARDS varies, depending on epithelial and endothelial damage [4,5]. The objective of this study was to investigate the expression of VEGF in lung tissue from ARDS patients. Methods Lung specimens were obtained by autopsy from 10 patients with severe ARDS and were compared with a control group of 10 non-ARDS patients autopsied. All lung samples were stained for standard histopathological analysis and for immuno- histochemical methods using a specific mouse monoclonal antibody. Results Compared with expression in non-ARDS control individuals, pulmonary expression of VEGF was significantly decreased ( P<0.001) in ARDS patients. Alveolar macrophages were similarly immunopositive in both groups. No differences were noted with regard to the individual patient's characteristics (age, gender, period of ARDS condition, number of ICU days). Conclusions A decrease in alveolar type II cellularity, due to apoptosis, has been observed during ARDS that may reduce the production of VEGF in the alveolar space and may participate in the decrease in lung perfusion.

Shibuya M: Vaneker, LM Radboud University Nijmegen Medical 2009, 13(Suppl 1): P55 (doi: 10.1186/cc7219) Introduction Mechanical ventilation (MV) induces an inflammatory response that contributes to lung injury such as in acute lung injury or acute respiratory distress syndrome. The efferent vagus nerve can limit the inflammatory response via the pathway. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of the selective 7nAChR agonist GTS-21 on pulmonary and systemic inflammation and lung injury induced by MV using clinically relevant ventilator settings. Methods C57BL6 mice ( n= 40) were intraperitoneally injected with 8 mg/kg GTS-21 or placebo, after which they were mechanically ventilated for 4 hours (tidal volume 8 ml/kg; positive end-expiratory pressure 1.5 cm H2O; FiO20.45). Untreated, not mechanically ventilated mice were used as controls. Arterial blood gases were obtained at the end of the lung homogenates. Lung TNFand IL-10 mRNA expression was measured using quantitative PCR. Results In GTS-21-treated mice, the alveolar-arterial gradient after MV was significantly reduced compared with placebo (14.0 \u00b1 0.76 vs. 16.2 \u00b1 0.59 kPa; P = 0.03). MV resulted in an increase of all cytokines in plasma and lung compared with control mice. TNF was significantly lower in plasma of GTS-21-treated animals compared with placebo (196.2 \u00b1 50.8 vs. 31.9 pg/ml; P= 0.04). Similarly, in lung homogenates a distinct trend was observed towards lower TNF levels in GTS-21-treated mice (53.9 \u00b1 12.5 5.6 pg/mg P = 0.06). IL-10 unaffected by GTS-21. MV strongly increased TNF mRNA expression in lungs of placebo animals (21-fold compared with controls); this was significantly lower in GTS-21-treated mice (11- fold compared with controls; P = 0.02). IL-10 mRNA expression was similar in GTS-21-treated and placebo animals. Conclusions MV with clinically relevant ventilator settings results in activation of the immune system. GTS-21 inhibits proinflam- matory cytokine production while The reduced alveolar-arterial gradient in GTS-21-treated animals indicates attenuation of lung injury. In conclusion, limiting the inflammatory response appears to reduce lung injury, and therefore the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway may represent new treatment options for MV-induced lung injury.P56 Usefulness of soluble E-selectin in the clinicopathologic assessment of acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome Y Kakihana, C Kuroki, H Murayama, T Ohryorji, N Kiyonaga, T Moriyama, A Matsunaga Kagoshima 13(Suppl 1): P56 (doi: 10.1186/cc7220) Introduction A retrospective observational study was conducted to evaluate whether the plasma level of soluble E-selectin [1] might be a specific pathologic marker of acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ALI/ARDS).

Results The plasma levels of soluble E-selectin determined within 24 hours of admission were significantly correlated with the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores determined within 24 hours of admission. Furthermore, the scores for both respiratory failure (evaluated by the PaO2/FiO2ratio) and liver dysfunction (evaluated by the serum bilirubin value) in the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scoring system were significantly correlated with plasma levels of soluble E-selectin. In relation to respiratory failure, the plasma level of soluble E-selectin was higher in patients with ALI/ARDS than in those without (Figure 1), and receiver operating characteristic analysis revealed that this parameter might be a specific marker of ALI/ARDS (Figure 2). Conclusions Soluble E-selectin might be specific and useful marker for the clinicopathologic assessment of ALI/ARDS in critically ill patients with systemic inflammatory response syndrome. However, further investigation is clearly needed to determine whether soluble E-selectin can indeed predict the development of ALI/ARDS. Reference 1.

S24P57 Prognostic value of epithelial neutrophil monokine induced by IFN in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid in critically ill pediatric patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome T Shahin, H Ibrahim Ain Shams University, Cairo, Egypt Critical Care 2009, 13(Suppl 1): P57 (doi: 10.1186/cc7221) Introduction Diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) is the histopatho- logical hallmark of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). DAD is due, in part, to dysregulated angiogenesis, with expression of angiogenic and downregulation of angiostatic chemo- kines. The objective of this study was to measure the levels of epithelial neutrophil activating peptide 78 (ENA78) as an angio- genic angiostatic chemokine in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of critically ill children with ARDS to determine the prognostic value of the ENA78/MIG ratio in assessing illness severity and patient outcome. Methods The study included 35 mechanically ventilated pediatric patients with ARDS and 28 mechanically ventilated patients due to nonpulmonary causes as a control group with mean age 16.5 \u00b1 10.2 and 29.1 \u00b1 8.1 months, respectively. They were subjected to fibroaptic bronchoscopic examination and broncho- alveolar lavage was done to estimate the ENA-78 and MIG levels using the ELISA technique. Results Both ENA-78 and MIG levels were found to be significantly higher among patients versus controls ( P<0.01) 18.9 pg/ml, respectively). ENA-78 was found to be significantly higher among nonsurvivors, while MIG was significantly lower among nonsurvivors in comparison with the survivors Applying a receiver operating charac-teristic curve indicated that ENA78/MIG ratio was the best discriminator between survivors and nonsurvivors at cutoff value 1.02 with 100% sensitivity and specificity. Conclusions Imbalance between angiogenic and angiostatic chemokines is the determining factor of ARDS patients' outcome. Future studies to investigate therapeutic modalities to enhance angiostatic factors or inhibit angiogenesis to delay diffuse alveolar damage and improve the outcome are recommended. P58 Cortisol-binding globulin cleavage at sites of inflammation in critically ill patients M Williams, A Zhou, C Summers, D Halsall, D Menon University of Cambridge, UK Critical Care 2009, 13(Suppl 1): P58 (doi: 10.1186/cc7222) Introduction In vitro studies have cortisol-binding globulin (CBG) can be cleaved by neutrophil elastase with a resulting reduction in affinity for cortisol [1]. Local elastase production by activated neutrophils may trigger cortisol release by CBG cleavage, providing a potential mechanism for targeted delivery of corticosteroids to inflamed tissues. We looked for evidence of this process at sites of inflammation in critically ill patients. Methods Sera and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid were collected from six mechanically ventilated patients with a clinical diagnosis of ventilator-associated pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). These samples, along with sera from six healthy controls, were subjected to gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and immunoblotting for CBG. Densitometry was proportion of cleaved CBG. Results CBG cleavage product was seen within the BAL but not the sera of patients with acute inflammatory lung disease. Figure 1 shows a typical western blot comparing control sera (C1 and C2), septic sera (S1 and S2) and BAL from the same septic patients (B1 and B2, respectively). The mean percentage of CBG in the cleaved form was 63.3% \u00b1 21.8 in BAL compared with 0.94% \u00b1 1.73 in sera from the same patients and 12.5% \u00b1 11.4 from healthy controls (see Figure 2; all comparisons statistically significant). Conclusions This study provides the first in vivo support for a mechanism of enhanced cortisol delivery to sites of inflammation that involves local CBG cleavage.

Endothelial cells express connexin (Cx) 37, Cx40 and Cx43 and cytokines may modulate their function in sepsis resulting in altered gap junctional intercellular communication. Our hypothe- sis is that tumor necrosis factor (TNF) will decrease gap-junction- dependent cell-to-cell communication of expressing vascular Cx37, Cx40 or Cx43 were used in these experiments. HeLa cells were treated with TNF (20 ng/ml) for up to 2 hours. In dye-transfer experiments, carboxyfluroscein (HeLaCx40 and HeLaCx43) or Alexa Fluor-480 (HeLaCx37) was injected into one cell for 10 seconds and cell transfer was allowed to proceed for 10 minutes and the number of labeled cells counted. Cell lysates were prepared in Triton X-100 lysate buffer and detergent-soluble fractions collected. Cx37, Cx40 and Cx43 were detected by western blot. Results After 1 hour, TNF treatment resulted in near total loss of dye-coupling in HeLaCx37 and HeLaCx43 ( P <0.02, n= 14 to 16) and remained constant up to 2 hours. Dye coupling in HeLaCx40 cells remained unchanged after 1 hour and decreased after 2 hours (P<0.05, n= 10). Western blots indicated that TNF treatment did not affect detergent solubility of Cx40 and Cx43. However, TNF caused a significant increase in detergent solubility of Cx37. Conclusions These results suggest that inflammatory mediators affect connexins differently. The loss of Cx37 function may be due to the loss of detergent resistance, suggesting internalization of Cx37 in response to TNF. Acknowledgement Transformed HeLa cells were a gift from Dr K.

Trained ambulance personnel may attempt endotracheal intubation in the field for OHCA patients. This study aims to review prehospital airway management in OHCA. Methods Observational, retrospective case review over a 4-year period. All cases of OHCA brought to the Emergency Department of the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, Scotland were identified. Patient demographics, the airway management technique and documented complications were recorded. The primary endpoint measure was survival to hospital admission. Results In total, 794 OHCA cases were identified. The aetiology of cardiac arrest was medical in 95.2%, traumatic in 3.9% and unrecorded in 0.9% of cases. Prehospital endotracheal intubation was attempted in 628 (79%) cases and was successful in 573 (91.2%) cases. A significant complication (multiple attempts, displaced endotracheal tube or oesophageal intubation) occurred in 55 (8.8%) cases. In total, 165 (20.8%) patients survived to hospital admission, of whom 110 (17.5%) had undergone pre- hospital intubation. Fifty-five (33.1%) patients who did not undergo prehospital intubation to hospital admission. Conclusions Prehospital endotracheal intubation for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest is associated with significant complications. For ambu- lance crews not routinely undertaking endotracheal intubation, a supra- glottic airway device may be more appropriate. Reliable methods of confirming endotracheal intubation in the field should be utilised. P61 Focused echocardiography and capnography during resuscitation from pulseless activity after out-of- hospital cardiac arrest G Prosen1, D Kupnik1, M Emergency Medicine, Maribor, Slovenia; 2Rosalind Franklin University, USA Critical Care 2009, 13(Suppl 1): P61 (doi: 10.1186/cc7225) Introduction The study of focused echo- cardiography (F-ECHO) and capnography to differentiate between pulseless electrical activity (PEA) and pseudo-PEA during resus- citation from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). Methods Patients in PEA, with stable values of end-tidal PCO2 (PETCO2) during compression pauses, underwent subxiphoid F-ECHO examinations during pauses for carotid pulse evaluation, assessing for the presence or absence of cardiac kinetic activity (synchronous myocardial wall and valvular movement). Patients with stable PETCO2during the time of F-ECHO examinations who had cardiac kinetic activity underwent a compression pause of 15 seconds during which an additional 20 IU bolus of vasopressin and a 0.9% NaCl bolus If pulselessness persisted after the 15-second pause, compressions were resumed. This group was denominated the F-ECHO group (November 2007 to October 2008, n= 16) and was compared with a NON-ECHO group (November 2005 to October 2007, n= 48) who also had PEA with stable PETCO2and were managed according to 2005 European Resuscitation Council guidelines without F-ECHO. Results There were no statistically significant differences between groups with regards to sex, suspected cause of arrest, initial cardiac rhythm, witnessed arrest, time elapsed before initiation of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), and bystander CPR. Primary outcome (ICU admission: 88% vs. 50%; adjusted values: OR = 22.4, 95% CI = 4.2 to 86.9, P<0.001) and secondary outcome (return of spontaneous circulation (carotid palpable): 94% vs. 54%, adjusted: 3.9 to 24-Available online http://ccforum.com/supplements/13/S1 Figure 2 (abstract P58) to P <0.001; hospital vs. 15%; adjusted 95% CI = 2.9 to 85.7, P <0.001; neurological outcome - CPC 1 (good cerebral performance) to CPC 2 (moderate cerebraldisability): 50% vs. 8%; adjusted values: OR = 36.4, 95% CI = 4.8to 115.4, P <0.001) were significantly better in the F-ECHO group. In the NON-ECHO group, significantly higher doses of epinephrinewere needed and capnography during PEA in OHCA facilitates return of spontaneous circulation, ICU admission, 24-hour survival, and hospital survival. This effect was attributed to theability to distinguish between PEA and pseudo-PEA and toinstitute appropriate treatment during CPR. The confirmation ofthese results in a large study is warranted. P62 Patients with an automatic external defibrillator applied by a bystander in a public setting have a strikingly higherfrequency of ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation than observed cardiac arrests in the home ML Weisfeldt1, C Sitlani2, T Rea2, D Atkins3, Hopkins USA; 2University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA; 3University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA, USA; 4Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI, USA; 5St Michael's Hospital, Keenan Research Centre, Li Ka Shing Knowledge Institute, Toronto, ON, Canada; 6Durham Regional Base Hospital, ON, Canada; 7Medical College of VA, USACritical Care 2009, 13(Suppl 1): P62 fibrillation (VT/VF) as the first recorded electrical rhythmin out-of-hospital cardiac arrest has declined from ~70% to ~25%over the past 30 years. This change has been attributed to primaryand secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease and VT/VF.We evaluated whether the incidence of VT/VF as first recordedrhythm differed by location among bystander-applied automaticexternal defibrillator (AED) patients and emergency medicalservices (EMS)-witnessed cardiac arrests.Methods A prospective cohort study of nontraumatic cardiac arrest from December 2005 to April 2007 in the ResuscitationOutcomes Consortium database from 10 US and Canadian sites.The incidence of an initial shockable rhythm on AED or documen-ted VT/VF was compared among bystander-applied AED patientsand EMS-witnessed arrests in public versus private settings.Results The first rhythm was known in 13,235 out of 14,059 (94%) adult EMS-treated cardiac in public settings and224/954 (23%) in private settings. Similarly, for bystander AEDapplied in the private setting, 39/114 (34%) were shocked. But, incontrast, 125/159 (79%) ( P<0.001 vs. all other) were shocked by the AED in the public setting. Witnessed arrests in both the privatesetting (vs. public) and in EMS-witnessed cases (vs. bystanderAED applied) were more likely to occur in older subjects andfemales. After adjusting for age and gender via logistic regressionmodels, a significant difference in the odds of having a shockablerhythm in a public versus private location of arrest remained inEMS-witnessed arrests ( P<0.005). The difference also remained in bystander AED-applied arrests ( P<0.001) after adjusting for age, gender, and bystander-witnessed status.Conclusions The incidence of VT/VF is far greater in the public setting particularly for bystander-witnessed AED-applied arrests.Patients in the private home setting, even for EMS-observedarrests, are far less likely to benefit from AED application thanbystander-witnessed patients in the public setting. Cardiopulmo-naryresuscitation strategies may need to be tailored by arrest location. P63 Survival unchanged 5 months after implementing the 2005 American Heart Association cardiopulmonary resuscitationand emergency cardiac care guidelines for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest B Bigham1, K Koprowicz2, A of USA; 3Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI, USA; 4University of California San Diego, CA, USA; 5Gresham Fire & Emergency Services, Gresham, OR, USA; 6University of Ottawa, ON, Canada; 7St Michael's Hospital, Keenan Research Centre, Li Ka Shing Knowledge Institute, Toronto, ON, CanadaCritical Care 2009, 13(Suppl 1): P63 (doi: 10.1186/cc7227) Introduction To improve survival from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, the American Heart Association released guidelines in2005. We examined the effect of these guidelines on survival inthe Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium (ROC) Epistry - CardiacArrest. We hypothesized that survival would increase afterguideline implementation.Methods One hundred and seventy-four emergency medical service (EMS) agencies from eight out of 10 ROC sites weresurveyed to determine 2005 American Heart Association guidelineimplementation, or crossover, date. Two sites with 2005 com-patible treatment algorithms prior to guideline release were notincluded. Patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest secondary toa noncardiac cause, EMS-witnessed events, patients <18 yearsold, and patients with do-not-resuscitate orders were excluded. Alinear mixed-effects model was applied for survival controlling fortime and agency. The crossover date was added to the model todetermine the effect of the 2005 guidelines.Results Of 174 agencies, 83 contributed cases to both cohorts during the 18-month period between 1 December 2005 and 31May 2007. Of 7,403 cases, 4,897 occurred during the 13-month(median) interval before crossover and 2,506 occurred in the5-month (median) interval after crossover. The overall survival ratewas 5.9%. Our model estimated an overall increase in survival overtime (monthly OR = 1.02, 95% CI = 0.99 to 1.04, P = 0.23), a decrease in survival at crossover (OR = 0.92, 95% CI = 0.66 to1.26, P = 0.59), and a further increase in survival over time after crossover (monthly = OR 1.005, 95% CI = 0.96 to 1.05,P= 0.84). Conclusions The present study found a trend towards increased survival over time and no statistically significant effect of the 2005guidelines early after implementation. This observed increase insurvival over time may be attributed to the Hawthorne effect orparticipation in the ROC or improved quality assurance. A delay inknowledge and skill acquisition amongst EMS providers and theneed to rechoreograph their cardiac arrest treatment may explainwhy no significant increase in survival was observed after imple-mentation. EMS providers may require more time to gain pro-ficiency in the guideline changes before the full potential of theguidelines can be realized. Further longitudinal study is needed todetermine the full impact of the guidelines on survival.Critical Care March 2009 Vol 13 Suppl 1 29th International Symposium on Intensive Care and Emergency MedicineS27P64 Outcomes following admission to ICU post cardiac arrest E Casey, B Marsh Mater Misericordiae University Hospital, Dublin, IrelandCritical Care 2009, 13(Suppl 1): P64 (doi: 10.1186/cc7228) Introduction ICU admission post cardiac arrest accounts for 6% of admissions to the ICU [1]. ICU survival post cardiac arrestranges from 25% to 35% [2]. We reviewed the records of bothout-of-hospital and inhospital cardiac arrest admissions to our ICUto audit their outcomes, the primary outcome variable beingsurvival to ICU and hospital discharge. Secondary objectives wereto determine the length of stay in the ICU and hospital of bothsurvivors and nonsurvivors.Methods We performed a retrospective review of all admissions to our ICU post cardiac arrest between January 2003 and December2006. Our data were sourced from the ICU access database, ICUdischarge summary and individual chart review. We recordeddemographics and data regarding each arrest.Results One hundred and forty-seven patients were admitted to our ICU during the 4-year period. The mean age was 59 years,ranging from 16 to 88 years. Out-of-hospital cardiac arrestaccounted for 51% ( n = 75) of cases, inhospital cardiac arrest for 49% ( n = 72). Asystole was the first identifiable rhythm in 39%, of which 21% survived to hospital discharge, 42% of whom had apoor neurological outcome. Ventricular fibrillation/ventriculartachycardia accounted for 32% of cases, of which 39% survived,all of whom had a good neurological outcome. Pulseless electricalactivity accounted for 29% of cases, of which 25% survived tohospital discharge, 10% of whom had a poor neurologicaloutcome. Overall survival was 27%, of which 15% had a poorneurological outcome. The mean ICU length of stay was 9.2 daysfor survivors and 6.8 days for nonsurvivors.Conclusions The high prevalence of asystole in both groups is not in keeping with previous audit series [3] in which ventricularfibrillation/ventricular tachycardia is the predominant arrest rhythmand may reflect a delayed response time. Our survival figures arecomparable with international data [3], which are limited. Thehigher male to female ratio is consistent with previous audit series[4], possibly reflecting the higher incidence of ischaemic heartdisease in males.References1.

But there are a few reports about chronic liver disease, Asian people, and the incidence of IHCA is rarely reported in theliterature. The aim of this study was to evaluate the hospitalmortality of adult patients who had experienced IHCA byunderlying disease and the incidence of IHCA.Methods Between March and October 2008, 69 patients who experienced IHCA were prospectively enrolled in the study.There were 64,345 total admissions to the hospital in thisperiod. Patients who had cardiac arrests in the ICU, emergencyroom, and operating room were excluded from this study. Thehospital mortality compared group A (chronic liver disease, 10patients and cancer, 24 patients) with group B (chronic lungdisease and heart failure, chronic renal disease and diabetesmellitus).Results The incidence of IHCA was 1.07 events per 1,000 hospital admissions. Of the 69 enrolled patients, 34 were assignedto group A and 35 to group B. The mean patient age of group Bwas higher than group A (66.7 vs. 56.5 years, P = 0.003). There was no difference of return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC)more than 20 minutes between the two groups (group A, 53% vs.group B, 63%, P = 0.40). The hospital mortalities of underlying disease were presented: chronic liver disease (90%), cancer(88%), chronic lung disease (20%), and heart failure (54%). Thehospital mortality was higher in group A than in group B (88.2% vs.45.7%, P <0.001). The hospital mortality was higher during the night compared with during the day (80% vs. 50%, P = 0.01) and ROSC was higher during the day than during the night (80% vs.41%, P = 0.001). Conclusions In this study, the chronic liver disease and cancer group had poor prognosis compared with the other underlyingdiseases such as chronic lung disease or heart failure.References1.

P66 Good outcome in octogenarians after ventricular fibrillation out-of-hospital cardiac arrest M Busch, E S\u00f8reide out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is highlyrecommended [1,2]. Still, there is great uncertainty when it comesto age limits for the therapy as the initial randomised studiesexcluded the majority of patients over 75 years of age.Methods We retrospectively studied 115 OHCA survivors that were treated with MIH in our ICU from 2002 to 2008 with regardto cerebral performance category (CPC) at hospital discharge.Inclusion criteria were the same as in the Hypothermia afterCardiac Arrest Study Group except for the age limits. Badoutcome was defined as severe disability (CPC3), vegetative state(CPC4) and death (CPC5).Results Bad outcome was significantly more frequent in patients older than 60 years (chi-square P = 0.003), but even in patients older than 80 years we had good outcome in more than 50% ofcases. The neurological outcome according to the different agegroups is displayed in Figure 1.Conclusions Although age seems to influence outcome, we found a surprisingly high incidence of good outcome even in the oldestcomatose survivors after ventricular fibrillation OHCA treated withAvailable online http://ccforum.com/supplements/13/S1S28MIH.

P67 What is full recovery? Reconsidering outcome of cardiopulmonary cerebral resuscitation beyond Glasgow-Pittsburgh Cerebral Performance Categories 1 T Abe1, S Izumitani1, T Sano1, Y Nagemine1, S International Hospital, Tokyo, Japan; 2St Luke's Life Science Institute, Japan Critical Care 2009, 13(Suppl 1): P67 (doi: 10.1186/cc7231) Introduction Cerebral performance of survivors from cardiopul- monary arrest is usually based on the Glasgow-Pittsburgh Cerebral performance categories (GP-CPC), and favorable neurological outcome are GP-CPC 1 (good cerebral performance) and GP-CPC 2 (moderate cerebral disability). Especially, CPC 1 is called full recovery. However, do the patients categorized as GP- CPC 1 work as they did before? We evaluated higher brain function among patients who were classed GP-CPC 1 and analyzed the factors influencing it. Methods A retrospective, observational, cohort study was conducted on consecutive patients (age 18 years) who were survivors from cardiopulmonary arrest hospitalized through the Emergency Department between 1 October 2006 and 31 March 2008 in an urban teaching hospital of Japan. There were 428 patients with cardiopulmonary arrest (CPA), and 136 patients (32%) were admitted to our hospital. Fifteen patients were categorized GP-CPC 1 and their higher brain functions were evaluated by physical therapists 1 month after CPA. Data were based on the Utstein style and collected on age, gender, location of cardiac arrest, witnessed, bystander cardiopulmonary resus- citation (CPR), defibrillator and cardioversion (DC) or automatedexternal defibrillator (AED) use, return of spontaneous circulation prior to Emergency Department arrival, estimated time of cardiac arrest, cardiac cause, and therapeutic mild hypothermia. Results Among 15 eligible patients, eight cases with nonhigher brain dysfunction and seven cases with higher brain dysfunction were analyzed. In patients with nonhigher dysfunction: bystander CPR, eight cases (100%); witnessed, eight cases (100%); and DC (AED) use, eight cases (100%). In patients with higher brain dysfunction: bystander CPR, three cases (43%); witnessed, five cases (71%); and AED (DC) use, six cases (86%). Patients with nonhigher brain dysfunction were more likely to receive bystander CPR than those with higher brain dysfunction (Fisher's exact test P= 0.026). Conclusions One-half of patients who were generally called full recovery could not work as they did before because they had higher brain dysfunction after resuscitation. It is important to analyze factors that influence the recovery to higher brain function in patients with GP-CPC 1 to improve the outcome of cardiopulmonary cerebral resuscitation. P68 Intracranial pressure monitoring during hypothermia after cardiopulmonary resuscitation E Isotani, Y Otomo, K Ohno Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, Japan Critical Care 2009, 13(Suppl 1): P68 (doi: 10.1186/cc7232) Introduction Two randomized clinical trials explored that induced hypothermia improved outcomes in adults with coma after resuscitation from ventricular fibrillation [1,2]. In this study, we present the usefulness of intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring to predict the patient's outcome after induced hypothermia. Methods Hypothermia (34\u00b0C, 48 hours) was induced in patients after the recovery of spontaneous circulation. The indication was as follows: motor response of Glasgow coma scale 5, at least one of the brain stem reflexes intact and age 15 to 80 years. ICP and oxygen saturation of the jugular vein (SjO2) monitoring were performed during hypothermia.Critical Care March 2009 Vol 13 Suppl 1 29th International Symposium on Intensive Care and Emergency Medicine Figure 1 (abstract P66) Outcome according to age group after ventricular fibrillation OHCA and MIH ( n= monitoring hypothermia. S29Results Hypothermia was induced in 23 patients (55%) after resuscitation. The outcome of nine patients (39%) was modified Rankin Scale 0 to 2, 11 patients (48%) were 3 to 5 and three patients (13%) were dead. ICP during hypothermia did not increase beyond 10 mmHg in neurologically good outcome patients (Figure 1). SjO2tended to be <80% in neurologically good outcome patients (Figure 2). Conclusions ICP monitoring during hypothermia was extremely useful to predict the patient's outcome. SjO2monitoring during hypothermia was also predictable about the patient's outcome. References 1.

P69 as early of outcome after inhospital cardiac arrest G Abdel Naby Alex Faculty of Medicine, Alex, Egypt Critical Care 2009, 13(Suppl 1): P69 (doi: 10.1186/cc7233) Introduction Cardiac arrest is a medical emergency that, in certain groups of patients, is potentially reversible if treated early enough. Outcome after cardiac arrest is mostly determined by the degree of hypoxic brain damage. Patients recovering from cardiopulmonary resuscitation are at great risk of subsequent death or severe neuro- logical damage, including a persistent vegetative state. The early definition of prognosis for these patients has ethical and economic implications; it is estimated that the cost for the care of severely brain-damaged survivors runs into billions of dollars each year. Methods The main purpose of this study was to investigate the value of serum neuron-specific enolase (NSE) in predicting outcomes in patients early after inhospital cardiac arrest. This study was carried on 30 patients who had inhospital cardiac arrest during their admission to the critical care unit and for whom cardio- pulmonary resuscitation was performed according to the protocol of the European Resuscitation Guidelines, who survived for at least 12 hours after the event and for whom informed consent wasobtained. We excluded patients with neoplastic diseases known to increase NSE levels (small cell lung cancer, melanoma and malignancy of the kidney and testicles, stroke (ischemic and/or hemorrhagic) or traumatic brain injury). Results As regards NSE, it was found that the NSE level at 24 hours in patients with good recovery ranged between 0.80 ng/ml and 10.20 ng/ml with a mean of 5.60 \u00b1 3.26 ng/ml, and for those with severe disability the NSE level ranged between 18.30 ng/ml and 20.50 ng/ml with a mean of 19.40 \u00b1 1.56 ng/ml. Vegetative patients had a higher NSE level than others with a mean of 64.38 \u00b1 26.16 ng/ml, and patients who died had a mean NSE level of 22.61 \u00b1 9.93 ng/ml. The difference was statistically significant, showing a higher NSE level in patients with more hypoxic brain insult after arrest who died or remained in a persistent vegetative state. ( Psignificant, P <0.001.) Conclusions The present study demonstrated that the NSE value at 24 hours after return of spontaneous circulation was one of the best predictors for neurological outcome as NSE levels, and it tended to increase in patients with a bad neurological outcome. The NSE level tended to decrease in those with a good neurological outcome. If NSE concentrations increase by >15 ng/ml, prognosis tends to be bad. P70 Controlled reperfusion prevents neurologic injury after global brain ischemia in a novel ischemic brain model Y Ko, B Allen, Z Tan, S Sakhai, G Buckberg David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, Los Angeles, CA, USA Critical Care 2009, 13(Suppl 1): P70 (doi: 10.1186/cc7234) Introduction Recent investigations have revealed that the state of post-ischemic brain recirculation is of major importance in recovery from sudden death, and we developed an isolated global ischemic brain model that excludes the confounding variables of bypass, donor blood, and whole body damage to investigate the strategy of controlled reperfusion. This study examines primary damage of cerebral function and tissue with uncontrolled brain reperfusion following 30 minutes of brain ischemia, and tests whether controlled brain reperfusion can attenuate the damage. Methods Sixteen pigs underwent 30 minutes of global brain ischemia by clamping major neck vessels via a small suprasternal incision. Seven pigs then received uncontrolled reperfusion with normal blood, while the other nine pigs received controlled reperfusion by infusing a modified (leukodepleted, hypocalcemic, hyperosmolar, enriched) warm blood solution into both carotid arteries for 20 minutes. Six pigs underwent Sham operation. Brain oxygen uptake and venous conjugated dienes (CD) were measured during reperfusion. The neurologic deficit score (NDS) (0 = normal, 500 = brain death) was determined at 24 hours after ischemia, and brain water contents and cerebral infarction by 2,3,5-triphenyl tetrazolium chloride staining were assessed post mortem. Results Sham pigs were neurologically normal at 24 hours. Uncontrolled reperfusion resulted in two early deaths with brain herniation, multiple seizures, low brain oxygen uptake*, high CD levels (1.64 \u00b1 0.03 A233 nm )*, and high NDS (244 \u00b1 19 in survivors)* indicating marked functional neurologic impairment. Postmortem analysis showed marked brain edema (84.3 \u00b1 0.6%)* and extensive brain infarcts*. In contrast, pigs receiving controlled reperfusion had high brain oxygen uptake, low CD levels (1.3 \u00b1 0.07 A233 nm ), no post seizures, and low NDS (41 \u00b1 11), with all pigs being able to sit and eat, and three showing complete recovery. Brain edema was reduced (81.8 \u00b1 0.5%), vs. controlled, mean \u00b1 SEM. Conclusions Our novel ischemic brain model provides an effective tool to study brain ischemia. More importantly, these data indicate that controlled reperfusion attenuates reperfusion injury in the brain as it has been applied in other organs, and introduces the potential of using controlled reperfusion as a new treatment for sudden death and stoke.

P71 underbody forced warm-air blanket in preventing postoperative hypothermia after coronary artery bypass graft surgery with normothermic cardiopulmonary bypass JE Teodorczyk, 1): P71 (doi: Introduction Perioperative hypothermia in coronary bypass graft (CABG) is associated with adverse outcomes [1,2]. An underbody forced-air warming blanket was developed for use in cardiac surgery. The primary aim of this investigation was to study whether this blanket could prevent postoperative hypothermia in routine CABG. Methods Sixty low-risk patients who underwent elective CABG were assigned into an intervention group that received the full underbody forced warm-air system ( n= 30) and a control group that received standard thermal care ( n= 30). Routine heat- conservation methods were applied in both groups including draping of the patient, fluid warming and normothermic cardio- pulmonary bypass (CPB) at core temperature ~36.5\u00baC. The forced warm-air system was set at 43\u00baC at the end of perfusion until departure from the operating room (OR). Bladder temperature was measured at: T1 - end of perfusion, T2 - departure from the OR, T3 - arrival in the ICU, T4 - 1 hour after arrival in the ICU, and T5 - 3 hours after arrival in the ICU. Results The number of patients arriving in the ICU with a bladder temperature 36\u00baC was significantly higher in the intervention group than in the control group, respectively 27 patients (90%) vs. 14 patients (46.7%) ( P <0.001). Initial temperatures (mean \u00b1 SD) time points T2, T3 and T4, the core temperature was significantly lower in the control group as compared with the intervention group, T2: 36.0\u00baC 3 hours after arrival in the ICU, both groups had similar bladder temperatures (37.3\u00baC \u00b1 0.6\u00baC vs. 37.2\u00baC \u00b1 0.7\u00baC; P = 0.568). The temperature drop from the end of CPB to arrival in the ICU was significantly less in the intervention group compared with the control group (0.4\u00baC \u00b1 0.3\u00baC vs. 0.6\u00baC \u00b1 0.4\u00baC; P = 0.027). Conclusions The present study shows that additional warmth management with a full underbody forced warm-air system, applied in the OR to patients undergoing normothermic CABG, prevents hypothermia with its deleterious effects in the early postoperative phase.

Even though the initial randomised trails excluded victims with noncoronary causes of OHCA, MIH may still be useful to attenuate ischemic brain damage in this group of patients. Methods We retrospectively studied 172 coronary and 32 noncoronary OHCA survivors that were treated with MIH in our ICU from 2002 to 2008 with regard to cerebral performance category (CPC) at hospital discharge. Bad outcome was defined as severe disability (CPC3), vegetative state (CPC4) and death (CPC5). Results Bad outcome was significantly more frequent in patients with noncoronary cause of OHCA (chi-square P <0.0001). The subgroups of noncoronary cardiac arrest differed substantially with regard to outcome. The outcome after coronary and noncoronary OHCA treated with MIH is displayed in Figure 1. Conclusions No randomised controlled clinical trial supports the use of MIH in noncoronary OHCA. Although noncoronary OHCA seems to influence outcome negatively, further studies are warranted to examine the potential benefit of MIH in this category of patients. References 1.

The aim of this study was todetermine whether nasopharyngeal cooling initiated during resus-citation improves the resuscitation rate (return of spontaneouscirculation (ROSC)), survival and neurologic outcome.Methods The study is ongoing. Cooling was performed using a novel device (RhinoChill; BeneChill, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA)that sprays a volatile coolant into the nasal cavity. Patients wererandomized to nasopharyngeal cooling during resuscitation or nocooling in the field, followed by cooling for all patients in hospital.All patients with witnessed arrest and a downtime less than20 minutes deemed eligible for resuscitation were included. Naso-pharyngeal cooling was initiated either before or after defibrillationand was continued until systemic cooling could be initiated.Patients who had achieved ROSC were excluded. Resuscitationwas continued until ROSC was achieved or for 30 minutes.Results Five patients were randomized to treatment and six were controls. ROSC was achieved in five out of five (100%) treatedpatients but in only three out of six (50%) controls. All five (100%)treated patients survived to hospital admission as compared withone out of six (16.7%) controls. At 24 hours, three out of five(60%) treated patients were alive as compared with none of thecontrols. The first treated patient who completed the 1-weekevaluation was neurologically intact.Conclusions Nasopharyngeal cooling initiated during resuscitation may improve the ROSC rate and survival to 24 hours. The impactof this treatment on long-term survival and neurologic outcomeremains to be determined. P74 Introduction of an external noninvasive cooling device for effective implementation of Intensive Care Society standards post cardiac arrest J McGrath, K Williams, D Howell, J Down University College Hospital London, UKCritical Care 2009, 13(Suppl 1): P74 (doi: 10.1186/cc7238) Introduction Despite cardiac arrests accounting for 5.8% of admissions to intensive care, there is significant variation in themanagement and outcome of these patients in different units [1].Randomised controlled trials have demonstrated that activecooling to 32 to 34\u00b0C for 12 to 24 hours after return ofspontaneous circulation (ROSC) significantly improves theoutcome of patients who have an out-of-hospital ventricular fibril-lation arrest [2]. However there are a range of cooling techniquesemployed, and no trials have demonstrated that any particularsystem is superior [3].Methods All adult patients admitted to critical care following out- of-hospital cardiac arrest with Glasgow coma scale <9 afterROSC were included. The initial audit included nine patientsadmitted between August 2006 and March 2007 who werecooled primarily with standard methods such as ice packs/coolingpads. Performance was re-audited between August 2007 andDecember 2007 following the introduction of CritiCool, andincluded nine patients. Data were collected using an audit form, acomputerised ICU patient database (CIMS) and clinical notes. Weassessed neurological outcome at ICU discharge by calculatingthe cerebral performance category (CPC). The CPC is scored on ascale (0 to 5) where higher scores indicate worse functionalimpairment.Results Following introduction of the CritiCool there was improvement in the speed of cooling to the target temperaturerange (patients effectively cooled within 4 hours: 33% vs. 57%).There was also improved ability to maintain patients within thetarget temperature range over the 24-hour period (57% vs. 70%).There was also a trend towards improvement in the mean CPCscore at ICU discharge from 3.4 to 2.3.Conclusions We have shown an improvement in the speed of cooling and target temperature maintenance. Our study alsoshows that the introduction of CritiCool correlated with animprovement in CPC. We suggest that more widespread use ofnoninvasive cooling devices may improve implementation ofstandards, avoid risks associated with invasive cooling devices andpotentially improve neurological outcome.References1.

We sought toevaluate current physician use, and barriers to use, of TH inCanada.Methods We developed a web-based questionnaire asking physicians to self-report their experience with TH using thePathman framework of changing physician behavior. We surveyedall members of the Canadian Association of Emergency Physiciansand the Canadian Critical Care Forum using the Dillman surveymethod between 19 March and 21 May 2008. Adjusted oddsratios were generated from a multiple logistic regression modelthat included all reported predictor variables.Available online http://ccforum.com/supplements/13/S1S32Results We surveyed 1,266 physicians, and 37% responded. Most (78%) respondents were emergency physicians, 54%worked at academic/tertiary-care hospitals, and 62% treated morethan 10 arrests annually. Almost all respondents were aware of TH(99%) and agreed that TH was beneficial (91%), but only two-thirds (68%) had used TH in clinical practice. Only one-half (50%)reported using standardized cooling protocols. Critical carephysicians were more likely to use TH than emergency physicians(93% vs. 61%, OR = 6.3, 95% CI = 2.5 to 16.0) and physicianswho worked at a facility with a cooling protocol were more likely touse TH than their colleagues at other facilities (86% vs. 43%,OR = 5.6, 95% CI = 3.1 to 10.0). Physicians 10 years post residency were more likely to have used TH (73% vs. 63%, OR =2.0, 95% CI = 1.2 to 3.3) as were physicians who treated >10cardiac arrests annually (78% vs. 53%, OR = 2.6, 95% CI = 1.6 to4.1). The use of TH was similar comparing academic/tertiary-carehospitals with community hospitals (OR = 1.6, 95% CI = 0.92 to2.88). Common barriers reported by physicians included: lack ofawareness (31%), perceptions of futility or poor prognosis (25%),too much work required to cool (20%) and staffing shortages(20%).Conclusions Self-reported adoption of TH is higher than previously reported at 68% among Canadian emergency andcritical care physicians. Adoption is more likely by critical carephysicians, those with protocols, and those treating >10 arrestsannually. Several barriers were reported; overcoming these mayimprove the adoption of TH. P76 Comparison between clinical tests and the Cerebral State Index or brain death determination M Mahjoubifard, S Borjian Boroojeny, F Nikbakht Zahedan 1): P76 (doi: 10.1186/cc7240) Introduction Diagnosis of brain death is very important. Confirmatory tests have been used to corroborate brain death, butthey are expensive, nonattainable in all ICUs and in some instanceshave no correlation with clinical tests [1]. The Cerebral State Index(CSI) (Danmeter, Odense, Denmark) is a portable apparatus thathas been made for determination of the depth of anesthesia basedon brain waves determination and analysis [2].Methods This is a study on 65 head-injured patients and 72 alert head-injured patients. Eighteen to 24 hours after confirmation ofbrain death by clinical tests applied by a neurologist, the CSI wasrecorded according to the company's instruction. The CSI wasrecorded if the electromyography was zero on the screen and thequality index was above 70%.Results If the CSI score was 3 for detection of brain death and the CSI score was 3 for detection of nonbrain-dead patients, the CSI can detect 100% of cases with brain death from nonbrain-dead patients. Furthermore, if burst suppression (BS%) >75% isfor detection of brain death and BS% between 0% and 75% is fordetection of nonbrain-dead patients, the CSI could detect 100%brain-dead patients from nonbrain-dead patients.Conclusions MRI, CT and electroencephalography are time consuming and expensive, and require specialized people. In aprevious study the Bispectral index scale (BIS) had been used forconfirmation of brain death [3], but was not successful becausethe range of EEG filtration of BIS is wider than that of CSI and thecalculation methods are different; moreover they did not considerBS% in addition to BIS. In the present study all of the clinicallydiagnosed brain-dead patients had CSI = 3 and BS% = 75%, andall of the clinically no-brain-death patients had CSI 3 and BS%75. So the sensitivity and specificity of CSI for detection of brain death is 100%.References1. Hammer MD, Crippen D: Brain death and withdrawal of spport. Surg Clin N Am 2006, 86:1541-1551. 2.

P77 Effects of mechanical ventilation on Cushing's triad G Nimmo, A Howie, I GrantWestern General 10.1186/cc7241) Introduction Cushing's triad of bradycardia, and abnormal breathing due to critically raised intracranial pressurewas described in 1903 [1] and is generally accepted clinically. Werecognised that our patients undergoing uncal herniation and brainstem compression (whilst intubated and ventilated) did not appearto exhibit this classic response.Methods We identified suitable patients from the Scottish Intensive Care Society Wardwatcher audit database for our ICUadmissions from August 1999 to February 2007. We used thesearch terms subarachnoid haemorrhage and traumatic brain injuryboth linked to brain stem death testing. From the resultant 175patients, a consecutive sample of 50 patients was chosen for chartreview. There were 30 males, mean age 40.5 years, and 20females, mean age 50 years. Diagnoses were subarachnoidhaemorrhage n = 27, stroke n = 6, traumatic brain injury n =5 , subdural haematoma n = 3, intracerebral haemorrhage n = 6, other n = 3. The time of coning was identified by the development of fixed dilated pupils and loss of cough reflex. Haemodynamics wererecorded 1 hour before coning occurred, at the time of coning and1 hour later. In 43 ventilated patients a hypertensive surge wasdocumented. One other patient underwent the blood pressuresurge breathing spontaneously and was not intubated. In sixpatients the haemodynamic surge had not been documented bythe bedside nurse. It was evident from chart review that coning hadoccurred in the hour between haemodynamic recordings.Results In 44 patients there was a significant rise in blood pressure at the time of confirmation of uncal herniation with asubsequent fall. This was accompanied by a major tachycardia in38 patients and a normal heart rate in five patients. Only onepatient exhibited a bradycardia and had been extubated as part ofwithdrawal of therapy.Conclusions We have demonstrated that the haemodynamic response to critically raised intracranial pressure in a ventilatedpatient is not a bradycardia. We have used an approach akin tothat of Cushing but all of the six patients in Cushing's originalpaper were breathing spontaneously. All but one of our patientswas ventilated. We suggest that by avoiding hypoxaemia andhypercapnic acidosis the cardiac response is altered. It isimportant for clinicians to be aware of this to aid recognition ofconing for diagnostic and prognostic reasons.Reference1.

The upper age limit for medicalsuitability was 75 years. Data were entered into the DA SystemDatabase for analysis.Results From 6,561 patients (36.2% of all records) with no absolute contraindications to donation, 2,973 (45.3%) metpreconditions for brain death (BD) diagnosis, 2,063 had signs ofsevere brain damage and 1,891 met criteria for formal BDdiagnosis (= potential donors). Belgium had the utmost number ofpatients with formal BD diagnosis (75.7%), and Switzerland(57.4%, P<0.0001) the lowest. Although donor identification rates were higher in France (93.6%) with the lowest in Finland (47.7%,P<0.0001), Finland excelled in donor referral (93.9% of identified cases) vs. only 63.8% in Switzerland ( P<0.0001), and excelled in family approach rates (92.7%) vs. only 70.2% in France(P<0.0001). Consent rates as a percentage of families approached were superior in Belgium and Finland (89.5%), withthe most inferior in France (65.7%, P<0.0001). Conversion rates as a percentage of potential donors vs. actual donors were higherin France (43.1%) and Belgium (42.9%) and were (34.9%) and Switzerland (33.5%) ( P= 0.0187). Only Belgium had a nonheart-beating donation policy during thestudy period, resulting in 11.2% more donors added to thecountry's donor pool.Conclusions The DA MRR proved to be an excellent tool to identify areas of improvement within certain steps of the donationpathway, such as donor identification, BD diagnosis, donor referral,family approach and obtaining consent. Moreover, the DA MRRhas shown to be applicable in different countries and environmentsand should be considered a unique tool for comparing countries'donation performance.Reference1.Donor Action Program [www.donoraction.org] P79 Critical care staff attitudes to organ donation impact on national donation rates: data from the Donor Action Database L Roels1, C Spaight1, J Smits2, B 10.1186/cc7243) Introduction The aim was to investigate whether critical care (CC) staff attitudes to organ donation, the concept of brain death (BD)and self-reported skills in donation-related tasks impact on nationaldonation rates.Methods Donor Action [1] Hospital Attitude Survey data 19,537 CC staff (MDs: 3,422, nurses: 13,977,others: 2,138) in 11 countries (Australia, Belgium, Croatia, Finland,France, Israel, Italy, Japan, Norway, Poland, Switzerland) betweenNovember 2006 and October 2008. Medical and nursing staffattitudes from each country were correlated with each country'sdonors per million population rates in 2007 (Council of Europedata). Data examined included average support to donation,respondents' willingness to donate their own, their children's andrelatives' organs, the acceptance of the BD concept and reportedconfidence levels with donation-related tasks.Results National donation rates significantly ( 0.0368). Conclusions Average CC staff attitudes and donation-related skills clearly influence their assessment and are a strong predictorof a country's donation rate, as demonstrated in this study.Measures to improve donation rates should focus on guidance andeducation of CC staff so as to ensure that these practitioners havesufficient knowledge and confidence with donation-related issues.Reference1.

P80 Effect of endotracheal suctioning on intracranial suctioning (ETS) is a routine nursing procedure used to decrease pulmonary complications; however, insevere head-injured patients it can result in a sudden increase inintracranial pressure (ICP) and may put the patient at risk forfurther cerebral damage [1-3]. The purpose of this study was toexamine the effect of ETS on ICP in severe head-injured patients.Methods Twenty-one patients with acute severe head injury (Glasgow coma score 8, range 4 to 8) were studied. Each subject received four passes of insertion of a standardized suctioncatheter and application of negative pressure limited to 10 to15 seconds in each procedure of suctioning. The ETS procedureconsisted of administration of 16 breaths at 135% of the patients'tidal volume, 100% FIO 2before and after suctioning with a standardized catheter (16 French) and duration between 10 and15 seconds. A repeated-measures model for ANOVA was used toexamine the changes in mean ICP 1 min before and during the first,second, third and fourth passes of catheter insertion.Results ICP significantly increased during suctioning ( P<0.001). The change in ICP was significantly greater in the fourth pass ofcatheter insertion than in other passes.Conclusions Changes in ICP induced by ETS in severe head- injured patients are significant. Suction passes should be limited totwo to three per procedure. Repeated suctioning may increaseICP.References1. Kerr ME, Rudy EB, of endo- tracheal suctioning in the acute phase of head injury.

P81 Elevated plasma ammonia concentration in patients with traumatic hemorrhage A Hagiwara, T Sakamoto National Defense Medical College, Critical Care 2009, 13(Suppl 1): P81 (doi: 10.1186/cc7245) Introduction The blood ammonia concentration has been reported to be elevated by hemorrhagic shock in animal studies, but this finding has been reported in only one clinical study in a small number of selected surgical patients. We therefore conducted a study to determine whether plasma ammonia is elevated in trauma patients at hospital admission and can be used as a predictive factor for serious hemorrhage. Methods The subjects were consequent trauma patients admitted to our level 1 trauma center between November 2006 and November 2007. Blood was sampled on admission from patients who met the inclusion criteria to determine plasma ammonia and arterial lactate concentrations. Patients requiring blood transfusion or intervention for bleeding within 24 hours were classified into a blood transfusion and intervention group (BTI group). Patients not requiring the transfusion or the interventions were classified into a non-BTI group. Logistic regression analysis was performed using patients requiring BTI as the dependent variable and ammonia concentration, lactate concentration, shock index on admission, systolic blood pressure on admission, and ISS as independent variables. Results The subjects were 148 trauma patients. The mean age was 44.8 \u00b1 20.8 years, and the mean injury severity scale was 17.7 \u00b1 13.2. Patients showed a significant correlation between ammonia lactate concentrations ( r= 0.46, P< 0.001). Inter- vention for arterial bleeding was required in 16 patients. Blood transfusion was required in 17 patients. The BTI group consisted of 21 patients. The BTI group had more hemodynamic instability and significantly higher ammonia and lactate concentrations than the non-BTI group. Logistic regression analysis shows that only plasma ammonia was a significant independent variable for BTI (P= 0.001). The odds ratio of requiring blood transfusion and/or intervention for arterial bleeding was 18.2 when ammonia was 80g/dl. Conclusions Elevated ammonia concentration on admission will be a predictive factor for traumatic hemorrhage requiring treatment. P82 Regulatory T cells are persistently enriched in the peripheral blood of head-injury patients EJ Galtrey, AL Cox, DA Chatfield, AJ Coles, DK Menon University of Cambridge, UK Critical Care 2009, 13(Suppl 1): P82 (doi: 10.1186/cc7246) Introduction We have previously shown that a significant proportion of patients have increased numbers of lymphocytes proliferating in response to myelin basic protein 10 days post traumatic brain injury (TBI); associated with a trend for more favourable outcome [1]. This suggests that the adaptive immune response may have a protective role following TBI, as demon-strated in animal models [2]. In this study, we further explored this process by examining the effect of TBI on regulatory T cell (Treg) numbers, and determining whether a change in Treg frequency was long lived. Methods We recruited 12 patients with severe or moderate TBI who required protocol-driven therapy to maintain cerebral perfusion and intracranial pressure. Blood samples were taken within 72 hours and 10 days post TBI. A separate group of patients was studied 6 months post TBI. Age-matched and sex- matched healthy volunteers were used as controls. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated. Flow cytometry was used to identify Tregs according to the surface expression of markers (CD4/CD25high/CD45ROhigh/CD127low). Results When compared with controls, patients at 10 days and at 6 months post TBI showed a greater proportion of PBMCs with a Treg phenotype (Mann-Whitney U test; P<0.01 and P<0.05, respectively). The proportion of Treg cells at 72 hours was higher than controls, but this difference did not reach significance. See Figure 1. Conclusions We have shown that TBI upregulates CD4+T cells with a regulatory phenotype. This effect is sustained for at least 6 months, and may modulate protective autoimmunity. Better understanding of the functional capacity and specificity of lymphocytes identified as Tregs may provide therapeutic targets. References 1. Cox AL, et al.: J Neuroimmunol 2006, 174:180-186. 2.

The intrathoracic blood volume was maintained in spite of systemichypovolemia, and this fluid redistribution caused hydrostatic fluid retention in lung tissues on PiCCO-plus monitoring after SHI. See Figures 1 and 2. Conclusions Persistent catecholamine release and the different sensitivity of blood vessels to catecholamine cause the blood volume redistribution: systemic hypovolemia and hydrostatic pulmonary edema. The excess cardiac preload due to catechol- amine release leads to brain natriuretic peptide release resulting in natriuresis. References 1. Isotani E, et al.: Stroke 1994, 25:2198-2203.

Methods An international multicentre randomised trial comparing decompressive craniectomy with medical management. Patients (n= 50 for the pilot phase, n= 600 for the main study) with traumatic brain injury and raised ICP (>25 mmHg) refractory to initial treatment measures are eligible for the study. Patients are randomised to one of two arms: continuation of optimal medical management (including barbiturates) versus surgery (decompressive craniectomy). The inclusion criteria are: traumatic brain injury, age 10 to 65 years, abnormal CT scan and the exclusion criteria: bilateral fixed and dilated pupils, bleeding diathesis, devastating injury not expected to survive 24 hours. Outcome is assessed using the extended Glasgow Outcome Score and the SF-36 quality of life questionnaire at 6 months, 1 year and 2 years.

P86 Drift analysis of a novel device for measurement of regional cerebral blood flow S Wolf1, L P86 (doi: 10.1186/cc7250) Introduction Bedside measurement of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) is a promising technology to detect vasospasm after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage [1]. The Bowman\u00aerCBF monitor facilitates continuous and quantitative assessment of brain tissue perfusion in ml/100 g tissue/minute with a thermodiffusion microprobe. The probe is self-calibrating at user-definable time intervals from 1 to 120 minutes. To estimate the necessary recali- bration frequency, we looked at the measurement drift between two calibration points. Methods In 32 patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemor- rhage, a Bowman\u00aerCBF probe was implanted in the vascular territory of the aneurysm-harboring vessel. According to previous experience, we performed automatic recalibration of the rCBF device every 30 minutes, thus yielding measurement periods of 25 minutes. CBF was recorded once per second. Data were averaged over 1 minute and all measurement cycles were pooled. Results The mean analyzed monitoring time per patient was 6.9 days. The mean rCBF was 24.4 ml/100 g/min at the beginning and 25.6 ml/100 g/min at the end of the measurement cycles between two recalibration periods, thus representing a mean drift of 1.15 ml/100 g/min per 25-minute measurement period (P<0.001). This drift was heterogeneous in different patients (range -3.67 to 12.0 ml/100 g/min). Patients number 24 to 32 who were monitored more recently showed a significant upward drift of 7.57 ml/100 g/min, whereas data from patients number 1 to 23 had a downward drift of -0.67 ml/100 g/min. Explanation forthis phenomenon is a revision of the monitor software by the manufacturer that was performed after patient 23. This finding was verified with external data. Conclusions The current implementation of the Bowman\u00aerCBF monitor shows a severe upward measurement drift that is clinically relevant. At present, the only solution is to perform recalibrations as frequently as possible. Reference 1.

J Neurosurg P87 Continuous monitoring of carbon dioxide reactivity in traumatic brain injury G De La Cerda, V Verma Royal London Hospital, London, UK Critical Care 2009, 13(Suppl 1): P87 (doi: 10.1186/cc7251) Introduction The objective is to study the relationship between end-tidal carbon dioxide (EtCO2) and cerebrovascular pressure reactivity in traumatic brain injury (TBI). Cerebrovascular pressure reactivity is the ability of cerebral vessels to respond to changes in transmural pressure. A cerebrovascular pressure reactivity index (PRx) can be determined as the moving correlation coefficient between the mean intracranial pressure (ICP) and mean arterial blood pressure. A negative or zero value reflects a normally reactive vascular bed whereas positive values reflect passive, non- reactive vessels. This index correlates significantly with outcome after TBI [1]. Carbon dioxide affects the cerebral vascular response. Our aim is to identify the optimal EtCO2, at which PRx reaches its lowest value. Methods A prospective observational study of 20 patients with TBI at the Royal London Hospital. All patients were managed according to the local guidelines for the management of TBI. PRx was determined by ICM+ (Cambridge University) software by calculating the correlation coefficient between ICP and arterial blood pressure. A total of 965 hours of data were recorded including the mean arterial pressure, ICP, cerebral parfusion pressure, PRx and EtCO2. plotted EtCO2against PRx to identify the optimal EtCO2and the range of carbon dioxide reactivity. The graph of PRx compared with EtCO2indicated a U-shaped curve, suggesting that too low or too high ETCO2was associated with a disturbance in pressure reactivity (Figure 1). We found this pattern in 66% of the patients. In the other patients (34%) there was no such correlation, so it was not possible to identify optimal EtCO2, probably indicating loss of carbon dioxide reactivity.Critical Care March 2009 Vol 13 Suppl 1 29th International Symposium on Intensive Care and Emergency Medicine Figure 1 (abstract P87) S37Conclusions PRx allows the determination of the carbon dioxide level at which cerebrovascular pressure reactivity reaches itsoptimal value in individual patients. That would allow a dynamicapproach to the carbon dioxide target in TBI.Reference1. Zweifel C, et al. : Continuous monitoring of cerebrovascular pressure reactivity in patients with head injury.

P88 Determining neurological prognosis in patients with severe traumatic brain injury: a survey of Canadian intensivists A Turgeon1, F Lauzier1, Burns2, L McIntyre3, J Pagliarello3, P H\u00e9bert3, for the Canadian Care Trials Group 1Universit\u00e9 Laval, Quebec, QC, Canada; 2University Canada; 4McMaster University, Hamilton, ON, (doi: 10.1186/cc7252) Introduction Current prognostic information following severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) is of limited clinical utility. Wehypothesized that wide practice variation exists in determiningprognosis in this population. We conducted a survey of Canadianintensivists to better understand prognosis determination anddecisions regarding level of care following severe TBI.Methods Survey items were generated to assess the perceived utilization and utility of different tests for prognosis determination,and the perception of prognosis and decision on the level of care.We used direct questions and scenario-based questions (five-point Likert scales). We pretested the questionnaire to assess itsclinical sensibility, and conducted test-retest reliability. Canadianintensivists were identified at all level I and level II trauma centers.The survey was administered electronically. Nonrespondents weresent a paper questionnaire.Results The response rate was 73% (180/215). Most respon- dents worked in teaching hospitals (95%), mixed medical/surgicalICUs (87%) with more than 40 severe TBI cases/year (65%). Poorneurological prognosis at 1 year was defined as Glasgow outcomescale 1, 2 or 3 for 69% of respondents. More than 60%considered that accurate prognosis determination would be mosthelpful within 7 days following severe TBI. Most respondents citedmonitoring (>70%), clinical examination (>85%) and CT scan(>90%) as being the most frequently used source of informationfor evaluating prognosis, as opposed to MRI (30%) orsomatosensory evoked potentials (15%). When asked if a 25-year-old male with severe TBI had a poor neurological prognosis at 1year, 40% of respondents disagreed/strongly disagreed, 30% hadno opinion and 30% agreed/strongly agreed. When asked howcomfortable they would be to recommend withdrawal of life-support measures, 82% reported being uncomfortable/veryuncomfortable, 9% had no opinion and 9% were comfortable/verycomfortable.Conclusions We observed significant variation in perceptions of neurological prognosis and in decisions regarding level of careamong Canadian intensivists. Considering the importance of suchprognostic information in clinical practice, a better understandingof prognosis determination in TBI is warranted.P89 Severe brain trauma management analysis using a high- rate recording tool: better definition allows better analysis of practice H Mehdaoui1, L Allart1, R Valentino1, I Elzein1, D Zitouni2, P Ravaux2 1Fort de France University Hospital, Fort De France, Martinique; 2Lille 2 University, Lille, France Critical Care 2009, 13(Suppl 1): P89 (doi: 10.1186/cc7253) Introduction Review of practice is a way to enhance quality of care. We developed a high-rate recording tool able to store thedata of critical care patients [1]. We recorded 15 severely brain-injured patients and analyzed our team's practice according tocommonly admitted recommendations.Methods Fifteen patients were recorded at a rate of one value each 2 seconds during a total of 750 hours. We analyzed the datato identify 5-minute or longer episodes of cerebral hypoperfusion(CHP) and intracranial hypertension (ICHT). The episodes wereelectronically detected among the signal files and manuallyvalidated using software allowing signal graph visualization andscrolling.Results Two hundred and forty-one episodes were detected: 135 episodes of ICHT and 106 episodes of CHP. ICHT and CHPepisodes were grouped in 84 episodes wereshorter than ICHT episodes ( P<0.02). Medical reactions were observed in 128 cases (53%) and more often concerned episodeslasting more than 30 minutes ( n= 88, 59%) than shorter episodes (n= 61, 41%). Electronic analysis of CHP showed that overall reactions are made to increase the mean arterial pressure (47%)rather than to lower intracranial pressure (35%). Adequacy ofmedical decisions for mean arterial pressure and intracranialpressure management was, respectively, 45% and 55%considering recommendations made for severe head traumamanagement.Conclusions Actual monitoring of severely injured patients misses short episodes. Computers could help to better detect suchepisodes by adequate algorithms. This method will lower thehuman performance usually observed in complex managementprotocols and could help to improve decision-making ifimplemented at the bedside.Reference1.

P90 Comparison of a new brain tissue oxygenation measuring probe with the established standard S Wolf1, (p btO2) monitoring with the Licox system (Integra Neuroscience, Germany) is on the verge of clinical routinein acute brain injury. Recently, a new p btO2probe by a different manufacturer (Raumedic AG, Germany) was introduced into themarket. As this new probe facilitates measurement of ICP as well,its use would reduce invasiveness of multimodal neuromonitoring.Therefore, we investigated the agreement of p btO2values of http://ccforum.com/supplements/13/S1S38probes and pbtO2monitoring. Methods Eight patients with pbtO2monitoring probes of both types implanted side by side in the same vascular territory were investigated. Multimodal monitoring data were stored online with dedicated software. Data were analyzed using the method proposed by Bland and Altman [1]. Results The mean measurement time per patient was 8.6 days. All data pooled, the mean bias was -0.66 mmHg. The precision range (two standard deviations of the bias) was -32.9 to 32.6 mmHg. The Licox probe showed a tendency for higher values at high pbtO2, while the Raumedic probe showed higher values at low pbtO2. Analysis of single patients revealed no discernible pattern in the relationship of measurement values of both probes. Three of the new probes ceased to function prematurely. Conclusions Our data suggest that measurements of both pbtO2 probes cannot be interchanged. No easy algorithm for conversion of measurement data from one system to the other is available. More rigorous bench testing is necessary before implementation of the new system in the clinical routine. Reference 1.

P91 The brain is a major source of S100 increase in porcine endotoxemic shock M Lipcsey1, M P91 (doi: 10.1186/cc7255) Introduction Cerebral dysfunction frequently complicates septic shock. A marker of cerebral dysfunction could be of significant value in managing sedated septic patients. Plasma S100 (S100B) proteins increase in sepsis. S100B is present in the brain, but also in other tissues. To date, the source of this protein has not been investigated in sepsis. The aim of this study is to determine whether the brain is the source of S100B in an experimental sepsis model.Methods Twenty-seven pigs were anesthetized and randomized to either infusion of endotoxin at the rate of 1 g/kg/hour ( n= 19) or saline ( n= 8). Catheters were inserted into a cervical artery and the superior sagittal sinus. Blood samples were collected from both sites and physiological data were registered before the start of the endotoxin infusion and hourly. After 6 hours, the animals were terminated and brain tissue samples were taken from the left hemisphere. S100B in plasma was measured by ELISA. Brain tissue samples were stained with biotinylated S100B antibodies. Results S100B levels increased in plasma and expression of S100B in cerebral tissue was higher in endotoxemic animals compared with controls. Statistically higher sinus versus arterial S100B concentration was only found at 2 hours in the endotoxemic animals (Figure 1). Conclusions Although other sources exist, the brain is a major source of S100B in endotoxemia, making it a potential marker of cerebral dysfunction in septic shock. P92 Anemia is associated with brain tissue hypoxia and metabolic crisis after severe brain injury P Kurtz, M Schmidt, J Claassen, E Carrera, L Fernandez, N Badjatia, S Mayer, K Lee Columbia University Medical Center, New York, USA Critical Care 2009, 13(Suppl 1): P92 (doi: 10.1186/cc7256) Introduction After severe brain injury, anemia can adversely affect cerebral oxygen delivery and brain tissue oxygen (PbtO2). How- ever, it is unclear whether low hemoglobin (Hb) contributes to brain tissue hypoxia or compromises oxidative metabolism. Methods We studied 28 consecutive patients with severe brain injury (15 with subarachnoid hemorrhage, 8 with intracerebral hemorrhage, and 5 with traumatic brain injury) who underwent multimodality intracranial pressure, PbtO2and microdialysis monitoring. The relationship between Hb levels and the risk of brain tissue hypoxia (BTH), defined as PbtO215 mmHg, and metabolic crisis as lactate/pyruvate ratio 40 and glucose <0.7 mmol/l, was analyzed with general linear models of logistic function for dichotomized outcomes utilizing generalized estimating equations for model estimation. Results The mean age was 53 (20 to 83) years, 18 (64%) patients were female, median Glasgow coma scale was 6 (IQR 4 to 8) and 32% were dead at discharge. A total of 3,209 hours of monitoring and 297 Hb measurements were collected and analyzed.

Mean/SE. * P <0.05. Figure 1 (abstract P92) Relative frequency of metabolic crisis across hemoglobin ranges. S39mean Hb was 10.1 \u00b1 1.5 mg/dl. Hb values were categorized into four ranges: 8 mg/dl, 8.1 to 9 mg/dl, 9.1 to 10 mg/dl and >10 mg/dl. The range with lowest frequency of MC and BTH (9.1 to 10 mg/dl) was defined as the reference. For every reduction in Hb range below the reference, there was an increased risk of MC (adjOR = 1.7 (95% CI = 1 to 2.9), P = 0.048 for 1 to 9 mg/dl; and adjOR = 4.2 (1.6 to 11.4), P <0.01 for 8 mg/dl) (Figure 1). A reduction in Hb below 8 mg/dl was also associated with increased risk of BTH (adjOR = 2.5 (1 to 6.5), P = 0.04) (Figure 2). The number of hours per day monitored spent in MC, but not with BTH, was associated with mortality at discharge (adjOR = 1.6 (1.1 to 2.4), P = 0.02). Conclusions Mild reductions in blood Hb below 9 mg/dl are associated with an increased risk of MC and BTH after severe brain injury. MC had a more pronounced relationship with anemia and was associated with a greater risk of death. P93 Nonconvulsive seizures and renal failure after intracerebral hemorrhage P Kurtz, L Fernandez, D Chong, L Hirsch, J Radhakrishnan, M Schmidt, K Lee, N Badjatia, S Mayer, J Claassen Columbia University Medical Center, New York, USA Critical Care 2009, 13(Suppl 1): P93 leptiform discharges (PEDs) are common and associated with poor outcome after intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). Our objective is to describe the frequency of renal, liver, metabolic and thrombotic dysfunction after ICH and its association with non- convulsive status epilepticus (NCSE), NCSZ and all patients with spon- taneous ICH who underwent cEEG monitoring between 1998 and 2006. Data assessed included admission creatinine and maximum values during the first 14 days for creatinine and bilirubin, and minimum values for bicarbonate, base excess and platelets. Acute renal failure (ARF) was defined as an increase in creatinine >50% from baseline, and severity was assessed by the RIFLE criteria. Other continuous variables were dichotomized using the mean value as the cutoff point to define the presence of liver dysfunction, acidosis and thrombocytopenia. ICH characteristics were based on CT scans. Univariate logistic regression was conducted to identify associations between predictors and NCSE, NCSZ and PEDs. Significant ( P <0.25) and clinically relevant variables werethen included in a multivariable logistic regression model to identify independent associations. Results A total of 102 patients were studied. The mean age was 62 \u00b1 17 years and 55 (56%) were male. Twenty-six (26%) patients were comatose on admission and 15 (17%) had an increase in ICH volume >30%. Seven (6%) patients developed NCSE, 18 (18%) NCSZ and 17 presented PEDs. ARF developed in 30 (29%) patients, liver dysfunction in 30 (29%), metabolic dys- function in 48 (47) and thrombocytopenia in 55 (54%). Patients with NCSZ and PEDs more frequently developed ARF (56 vs. 24%, P = 0.01 and 47 vs. 26%, P = 0.08, respectively). After adjusting for age, gender, coma at admission and increase in ICH volume, patients with ARF were six times more likely to develop NCSZ (OR = 5.9, 95% CI = 1.4 to 24.6, P = 0.01) as compared with those without ARF. Similarly, after adjusting for age, gender and coma/stupor at admission, each one-point increase in the RIFLE criteria doubles the odds of developing PEDs (OR = 2.0, 95% CI = 1.1 to 3.6, P = 0.02). No significant associations were found for NCSE. Conclusions ICH location within 1 mm from the cortex, an increase in ICH volume, coma or stupor at admission and the presence of ARF were independently associated with the development of NCSZ and PEDs after ICH. P94 S100 beta is a marker of brain insult caused by systemic inflammatory response syndrome S Belyshev, A Levit, N Davydova Regional Hospital, Ekaterinburg, Russian Federation Critical Care 2009, 13(Suppl 1): P94 (doi: 10.1186/cc7258) Introduction Central nervous system (CNS) failure along with other systems is included in septic multiorgan failure; however, in our opinion, it is the less studied. Earlier, a S100 level rise was described for septic encephalopathy patients, but together with this sites of a local ischemia or a bleed were discovered according to computer tomography in a brain [1]. The purpose of the present study is to determine whether it is the functional or the organic CNS insult that defines septic encephalopathy and to study the dependence of septic encephalopathy on the severity of sepsis. Methods The prospective study involves 28 septic patients according to sepsis criteria and ACCP/SCCM classifications. The primary site localization of infection in our study excluded the CNS according to computer tomography. After the approval of the hospital ethics committee we investigated the patients without neurological disturbances. The patients were divided into two groups. The first group ( n= 12) included the patients with various degrees of impairment of consciousness (<15 points of the Glasgow coma scale). The second group ( n= 16) included patients without any disturbances of consciousness. There were no differences between groups in age, gender, severity of sepsis, the cortisone level, lactate, and arterial and jugular bulb blood saturation. Results The S100 level in group 1 was reliably higher than in group 2, and on average it surpassed the normal rate by 2.6 times (group 2 showed the S100 level as not exceeding the normal level of 0.15 units/ml). Venous blood saturation in the two groups reliably did not differ and was within the norm. However, the saturation of the jugularis blood in group 1 was equal to 57.64 \u00b1 13.3, which is below the norm. Venous blood lactate exceeded in group 2, while group 1 showed a normal rate both in venous and jugular blood (lactate jugular = 1.76). The 28-day mortality was reliably higher in group 1. The S100 level correlated with mortality.Available online http://ccforum.com/supplements/13/S1 Figure 2 (abstract P92) Relative frequency of brain tissue hypoxia across hemoglobin ranges. S40Conclusions CNS failure under septic encephalopathy is of organic character and relates to CNS cell necrosis that is not offocal character. The results obtained have suggested that theS100 level may be considered a marker of unfavorable outcome in patients with severe sepsis.Reference1.

P95 Cerebral oxygenation monitoring in critical care patients with traumatic brain injury T Tokutomi, T Miyagi, H Katsuki, Y Takeuchi, M Shigemori 1): P95 (doi: 10.1186/cc7259) Introduction One of the most controversial areas of traumatic brain injury (TBI) critical care is the management of cerebral perfusionpressure (CPP). Since optimal CPP levels depend on whethercerebral autoregulation is preserved, these levels must be determinedfor individual cases. The aim of this study was to investigate the role ofjugular venous saturation (SjO 2) and brain tissue oxygen tension (PbrO2) monitoring in addition to CPP and intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring in the acute management of patients with TBI.Methods Thirty-six severe TBI patients (ages 16 to 69 years, GCS score 4 to 7) admitted to our neurosurgical critical care unit wereevaluated. ICP (Camino), CPP, and SjO 2(Abbott) were continuously monitored in the 36 patients, and PbrO2(LICOX) was continuously monitored in the last 10 patients. The treatment goalwas aimed at keeping ICP <20 mmHg and CPP >60 mmHg.Patients with good recovery or moderate disability on the GlasgowOutcome Scale at 6 months after injury were regarded as havingfavorable outcomes, and those with severe disability, vegetativestate, or death were regarded as having unfavorable outcomes.Results Thirteen patients had favorable outcomes. PbrO 2values showed a positive correlation with CPP ( r= 0.380, P<0.0001). SjO2tended to be abnormally values were <15 or >45 mmHg. High SjO2combined with low CPP or low PbrO2was associated with unfavorable outcome. The occurrence rate of CPP above 60 mmHg during the first 5 days ofmonitoring was 89.8% of the measurements in favorable outcomepatients vs. 72.7% of those in unfavorable outcome patients (likelihood ratio = 1.2). These proportions were altered to 70.3% vs.46.8% (likelihood ratio = 1.5) when the simultaneous SjO 2values were normal, and to 85.8% vs. 51.2% (likelihood ratio = 1.7) whenthe simultaneous PbrO 2values were more than 20 mmHg. Conclusions The present data emphasize the clinical significance of brain oxygen monitoring in TBI and provide evidence for highSjO 2caused by cerebral hypoperfusion. SjO2and PbrO2measure- ments in combination with ICP and CPP should help in improvingthe accuracy of monitoring intracranial pathophysiology and response to treatment. P96 Addition of new criteria to the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment for the patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage S Macedo, B Oliveira, D Lima, A Da Silva, N Bastos, R De Carvalho Hospital S\u00e3o purpose of the treatment of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is to prevent or reverse ischemic disabilitiesthrough hemodynamic therapy (4H therapy) [1]. We add somecriteria to the index to assess patients with SAH.Methods Informed consent for each patient/family, APACHE II score, weekly Sequential Organ Failure Assessment, serumglucose, lactate, calcium, sodium and magnesium, measurement ofaxillary temperature and hourly diuresis as the additional prognosticindex Sequential Organ Failure Assessment were obtained. Thestudy enrolled 91 patients diagnosed with SAH, confirmed by CTin the ICU. The conduct to approach these new criteria was thesame in all patients. These patients were divided into two groupsaccording to their development in the ICU: Group I - patients whohad satisfactory development (out of the ICU), and Group II -patients who progressed to death.Results Among 91 patients, Group I had 55 patients (60.4%) and the 36 remaining patients (39.6%) were classified as a Group II.See Table 1.Conclusions Regarding the criteria used to assess patients with SAH, we concluded the only criteria that showed statistical signifi-cance in the prediction of death was the serum sodium ( P= 0.002).

The objective of this study is todescribe the frequency of renal, liver, thrombotic and metabolicdysfunction after SAH and their association with NCSE, NCSZand PEDs.Methods We studied all patients with SAH who underwent cEEG monitoring from 1997 to 2004. Data assessed included admissioncreatinine, maximum values during the first 14 days for creatinineand total bilirubin, and minimum bicarbonate, base excess andplatelets. Renal failure was defined either as a maximum creatinine>1.1 mg/dl or as an increase in creatinine >50% from baseline.Severity of renal dysfunction was assessed by the RIFLE criteria.The other continuous variables were dichotomized using the meanvalue as the cutoff point that defined liver dysfunction, metabolicacidosis and thrombocytopenia.

Acute renal failure (ARF) developed in 18 (15%)patients, liver dysfunction in 24 (21%), low bicarbonate in 37(32%), low base excess in 72 (62%) and thrombocytopenia in 55(47%). After adjusting for age, gender and Hunt-Hess grade,patients with severe metabolic acidosis were six times more likelyto develop NCSZ as compared with those without acidosis (OR =5.9, 95% CI = 1.2 to 27.8, P = 0.03). Similarly, after adjusting for age, gender and Hunt-Hess grade, patients with renal dysfunctionwere six times more likely to develop NCSE as compared withthose without ARF (OR = 5.8, 95% CI = 1.5 to 21.8, P = 0.01). No association was found with PEDs.Conclusions Organ dysfunction is common after SAH. Metabolic acidosis and renal dysfunction were independently associated withthe development of NCSZ and NCSE, respectively. P99 Alteration of cardiopulmonary function after subarachnoid hemorrhage E Isotani, Y Otomo, K Ohno Tokyo Medical JapanCritical Care 2009, 13(Suppl 1): P99 (doi: 10.1186/cc7263) Introduction Volume management is crucial in intensive care; however, in some patients it is very hard to achieve optimal waterbalance. The subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) patient is arecommon after SAH: neurogenic pulmonary edema, cardiac failure,and so on. In this study we will present the time course ofcatecholamines and natriuretic polypeptides and fluid redistributionon pulse SAH.Methods Plasma catecholamines and natriuretic polypeptides of 54 consecutive patients were measured every other day during2 weeks after SAH. The cardiopulmonary functions of 37 conse-cutive patients were monitored by PiCCO-plus daily during2 weeks after SAH.Results Noradrenalin, dopamine and brain natriuretic polypeptide concentrations were significantly high during the entire studyperiod. Intrathoracic blood volume was maintained in spite ofsystemic hypovolemia, and this fluid redistribution causedhydrostatic fluid retention in lung tissues on PiCCO-plusmonitoring after SAH. See Figures 1 and 2.Conclusions Persistent catecholamine release and the different sensitivity of blood vessels to catecholamine cause the bloodvolume redistribution: systemic hypovolemia and The excess cardiac preload due to catecholaminerelease leads to BNP release resulting in natriuresis.References1.

However, in an effort to improve neurologic outcomes of patients with nontraumatic subarachnoidhemorrhage (SAH), transfusions are still used frequently tomaintain hemoglobin of 10 g/dl. We hypothesized that PRBCtransfusion in patients with SAH would worsen their outcomes.Methods We conducted a 19-month retrospective study of 84 patients with nontraumatic SAH in an intensivist-run, high-volume,academic ICU. Patients who received at least 1 unit PRBCtransfusion during their hospital stay ( n= 42, median 3 units) were compared with those who did not ( n= 42). Outcomes of interest were vasospasm (defined both clinically and by transcranialDoppler velocities), 28-day mortality, poor neurologic outcome(defined as modified Rankin score of 4), and occurrence of nosocomial infections (defined by National Healthcare SafetyNetwork criteria). Associations of PRBC transfusions with theseoutcomes were measured using univariate and multivariate analysisthat adjusted for age, gender, ethnicity, comorbidities, neurologicstatus upon presentation, and procedures.Results Patients with and without PRBC transfusions were similar in age, gender, ethnicity, comorbidities, and neurologic status uponpresentation. There was no difference in the incidence ofvasospasm with transfusions (52% vs. 37%, P = 0.12) or mortality (12% vs. 17%, P = 0.53). PRBC transfusions were associated with nosocomial infections (69% vs. 33%, P = 0.001) and poor neurologic outcome (69 vs. 48%, P = 0.046) in univariate analysis. After adjustment for potential confounders, PRBC transfusion wasan independent predictor of nosocomial infections (OR = 3.7,95% CI = 1.2 to 11.6, P = 0.03) but not poor neurologic outcome (OR = 1.9, 95% CI = 0.4 to 10.6, P = 0.45). Conclusions Use of PRBC transfusion in ICU patients with SAH does not improve neurologic outcome but increases risk ofnosocomial infections. Hence, restricted use of PRBC may bejustified in this segment of the ICU population, as well. P101 Emergency surgical management for prevention of symptomatic vasospasm and normal pressurehydrocephalus after subarachnoid hemorrhage due to ruptured cerebral aneurysm K Ishii, M Fujiki, H Kobayashi Oita University 2009, 13(Suppl 1): P101 (doi: 10.1186/cc7265) Introduction Various pieces of research have been done on prevention or treatment of symptomatic vasospasm and normalpressure hydrocephalus after subarachnoid hemorrhage due toruptured cerebral aneurysm. However, this important issue is stillunresolved. In this preliminary report, we introduce our surgicalstrategy and techniques of subarachnoid hemorrhage due toruptured cerebral aneurysm and discuss the prevention ofsymptomatic vasospasm and normal pressure hydrocephalus in thesurgical aspect.Methods The subjects consisted of 19 consecutive patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage due to a ruptured cerebral aneurysmwho were surgically treated in acute stage between 2006 and2007. All aneurysms were located at the anterior circulation. Hunt& Kosnik classifications were 1 to 3, WFNS were 1 or 2, and theFisher group was 2 or 3. We performed neck clipping of theaneurysm through the lateral supraorbital or pterional approach.We opened surrounded cisterns of the Circle of Willis andremoved the hematoma as much as we could. The laminaterminalis was routinely opened during the operation. We did notinsert any drainage tube postoperatively.Results Symptomatic vasospasms were noted in four patients. However, the symptoms were not severe and were transient in allpatients. There were no patients with normal pressure hydro-cephalus. The clinical outcomes were good or excellent. Therewere almost no perioperative complications due to surgicalprocedures.Conclusions The surgical techniques with certain contributions might prevent symptomatic vasospasm and normal pressurehydrocephalus after subarachnoid hemorrhage due to a rupturedcerebral aneurysm. An accumulation of cases is necessary. P102 Diagnosis and treatment of subarachnoid hemorrhage- induced vasospasm Doppler (TCD) and are used to monitor and guide its treatment;however, no systematic approach to interpret their values existsyet. The aim of our study was to evaluate the correspondencebetween sonographic and angiographic findings and the efficacyof the endovascular treatment.Methods One hundred and one patients were admitted to our neurological ICU with SAH from June 2006 to September 2008.All of them were examined with daily TCD. Mean flow velocity inthe middle cerebral artery >200 cm/s or an increase >50 cm/s/dayor a mean flow velocity in the other arteries more than two timesthe normal values were interpreted as indicative of severevasospasm. If a second TCD showed high blood velocities, anAGF was performed. If the vasospasm was confirmed, the patientwas considered eligible for endovascular treatment. Ten patientsdeveloped severe vasospasm and were analyzed in this study.Results All patients presented poor clinical condition at admission (Hunt Hess 4 \u00b1 0.9, Fisher grade 3.7 \u00b1 0.4). Sixty percentdeveloped intracranial decompressive vasospasm occur-red 9 after (8.5 wascorrespondence between the sonographical efficacy in 75% of them. Ninepatients developed recurrent vasospasm after the endovasculartherapy. Each patient received 1.8 \u00b1 1.03 treatments. Two patientswith refractory vasospasm died in the neurological ICU forintracranial hypertension; the other eight patients had goodrecovery at discharge (Glasgow coma scale 12 \u00b1 2.3). At the6-month follow-up all patients had a favorable Glasgow outcomescore (3.9 \u00b1 1.59).Conclusions Our study confirmed the excellent correlation between TCD and angiography in patients with middle cerebralartery flow velocity >200 cm/s. TCD can be considered a veryuseful bedside tool for early detection of vasospasm. Theendovascular management of vasospasm appeared to be safe andeffective. The efficacy of the association of pharmacological andmechanical approach in improving outcomes after SAH and inreducing the frequency of secondary neurologic deficits wasdemonstrated.Available online http://ccforum.com/supplements/13/S1S44P103 Effects of simvastatin in prevention vasospasm in nontraumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage: preliminary data S Macedo, Y Bello, A C Siqueira, S Vasospasm is the main cause of death and cognitive deficits in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage after rupture ofan aneurysm (aSAH). Some trials have shown that statins in theacute phase of aSAH reduce the incidence, morbidity and mortalityof cerebral vasospasm [1]. The purpose of this study is to evaluatethe potential of simvastatin (SVT) as prevention against vasospasm.Methods We realized a prospective, randomized, nonblind study with the use of 80 mg SVT (night) in the first 72 hours of thebeginning of bleeding, and a control group that did not use SVT,for 21 days between January and December 2008. Informedconsent was obtained for all patients. CT scans were performed asa control and another CT scan was performed in patients withaltered neurological signals. In the presence of changessuggestive of vasospasm or correlation in clinical conditions andCT scans, the patients were taken for a cerebral arteriographyexamination followed by an angioplasty procedure if necessary.Liver and renal function and LDL cholesterol were evaluatedweekly, and total creatine kinase was evaluated every 3 days.Exclusion criteria: liver and renal disease, pregnant elevation ofserum transaminases (three times normal value), creatinine 2.5, rhabdomyolysis or total creatine kinase 1,000 U/l. Results We excluded two patients with bleeding for more than 72 hours. There was no significant change in the levels of totalcreatine kinase, and renal or liver function. We included 21patients, 11 in the SVT group and 10 in the control group. Mortalitywas eight patients (38%), six patients in the control group and twoof the SVT group. Vasospasm was confirmed by cerebralarteriography examination in four patients in the control group andone patient in the SVT group. All the patients who died showedFisher scale IV.Conclusions SVT at a dose of 80 mg was effective in reducing the mortality (18.1% against 60%) compared with the group that didnot use SVT, and also decreased the incidence of cerebralvasospasm despite the APACHE II score being higher in the groupthat used SVT (14.3 vs. 10.7). Less morbidity occurred in the SVTgroup, with an average Glasgow outcome score of 3.25 vs. 2.1.Reference1.

The main goal of the study was toachieve a Mg serum concentration from 2.5 to 3.5 mg/dl, using asolution of Mg 2% (saline solution 5% 400 ml + MgSO 410% 100 ml/24 hours), during the first 14 days of aneurysm rupture.Admission criteria: patients diagnosed with SAH and T<96 hours. Exclusion criteria: patients with SAH and T>96 hours. Results In a previous study evaluation we analysed a total of 56 patients with ( n= 26 in Group 1 and n= 30 in Group 2) (Tables 1 and 2). Main results: Group 1 - vasospasm frequency 26.9% ( n=7 ) mortality 19.2% ( = 28 days; Group 2 - vasospasm frequency 46.7% ( n = 14) and mortality 33.3% ( n= 10) in 28 days. Conclusions According to the outcome, we can conclude that Group 1 obtained greater protection on the vasospasm incidenceand decrease of mortality in comparison with Group 2. The P value was not significant due to a still small number of patients.Reference1. Schmid-Elsaesser R, et al.: Intravenous magnesium of patients hemorrhage: a randomized study.

Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) isdefined as pneumonia occurring more than 48 hours after initiationof mechanical ventilation. About 20% of post-aneurysmal SAHpatients are reported to experience VAP [2]. In this trial, we aimedto report the short-term outcomes of VAP. We performed asurveillance analysis on aneurysmal SAH patients who requiredmechanical ventilation for more than 48 hours.Methods After obtaining approval from the Human Studies Committee of the University of Louisville to retrospectively analyzethe prospectively collected patient data, we reviewed the elec-tronic records of our aneurismal SAH patients admitted between2004 and 2007. VAP was diagnosed and confirmed by theClinical Pulmonary Infection Score supported with culture resultson days 0 and 3. We analyzed host-specific and disease-specificand care-related risk factors. Categorical variables were comparedwith the chi-square test, and continuous data were analyzed withthe unpaired tand Kruskal-Wallis tests. Results Within 86 aneurysmal SAH patients admitted to the ICU, 45 patients needed to be ventilated for more than 48 hours (52%),and 16 of them developed VAP (19%). More than 80% of patientswith SAH required either vascular of VAP were late-onset pneumonias (88%). The mechanical was longer in the VAP patients. About20% of VAP group patients were also diagnosed with sepsis.However, the duration of ICU stay was neither influenced by VAPnor by sepsis. Four patients who did not experience any VAP werediagnosed with stroke during their ICU stay. All-cause mortalitywas not longer in patients with VAP.Conclusions In this preliminary report of a prospective cohort trial, it appeared that VAP did not contribute to additional morbidity ormortality. The majority of VAP occurred late in the course ofventilation. This supports the theory that VAP occurs primarily dueto the disease itself and that detailed and prolonged care isrequired for the management of aneurysmal SAH P106 from subarachnoid haemorrhage I Whitehead, N Azam, S Bonner, J Wright James Cook University Hospital, Middlesbrough, UKCritical Care 2009, 13(Suppl 1): P106 (doi: 10.1186/cc7270) Introduction A retrospective assessment of the outcome of patients with poor-grade (World Federation of Neurosurgeons Grades 4 and 5) subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) at a regionalneurosurgical centre. Previous studies have shown aggressivetreatment of patients with a poor clinical grade of SAH iswarranted as grading can improve following resuscitation anddrainage of cerebrospinal fluid [1,2]. Many units still withdrawtreatment if these patients do not improve neurologically in the first48 to 72 hours [3].Methods A retrospective analysis of the notes of 116 patients who were recorded as having a diagnosis of SAH was performedbetween October 2002 and January 2006. Patients were excludedif they were World Federation of Neurosurgeons Grade 1, 2 or 3,had a traumatic SAH or been incorrectly classified as having SAH.Results Of 116 patients identified with a diagnosis of SAH, 12 patients were excluded as they had a traumatic SAH, one patienthad a dissection, one patient a subdural haemorrhage and onepatient a basal coma score >12. Eighty-eight patients were correctlydeemed as poor grade. All poor-grade patients were admitted to the intensive therapy unit. Of these 88 patients, 34 (38.6%)survived. Twenty-four (70%) of the survivors were dischargedhome, eight (24%) to a care home, and two (6%) remained inhospital. Seventeen (50%) had a Glasgow Outcome Score of 4 or 5.Conclusions Outcomes from poor-grade SAH at James Cook University Hospital compare favourably with published data.Review of the literature gives a wide variation in outcome between3.2% and 42%. It is our hypothesis that a combination of moreaggressive critical care management combined with earlyintervention should result in a reevaluation of treatment plans inthose with a historically perceived poor outcome.References1.

P107 Full Outline of Unresponsiveness compared with Glasgow coma scale assessment and outcome prediction in coma D Ledoux1, M Bruno2, S Jonlet1, P Choi1, 13(Suppl 1): P107 (doi: 10.1186/cc7271) Introduction The most widely adopted scale to assess consciousness in severely brain-damaged patients is the Glasgowcoma scale (GCS) [1]. Its major shortcomings are the failure toassess the verbal component in intubated patients, the inability totest brainstem reflexes and breathing patterns. In 2005, Wijdicksand colleagues proposed a new coma scale, the Full Outline ofUnresponsiveness (FOUR) scale [2], which consists of fourcomponents (eye, motor, brainstem, and respiration), each compo-nent having a maximal score of 4. Our objective was to validate theFrench version of the new FOUR coma scale in a general ICU andto assess its predictive value as compared with the GCS.Methods We performed FOUR and GCS evaluations in randomized order in 176 acutely brain-injured patients (days frominsult to randomization <1 month). We assessed the associationbetween GCS and FOUR scores using the Spearman correlationcoefficient. A logistic regression analysis adjusted for age andetiology of coma was performed to assess the link between thestudied scores and the outcome based on the Glasgow outcomescales 3 months after injury ( n= 63). Results The GCS and FOUR showed a significant correlation (r= 0.807). The GCS verbal component was scored 1 in 146 patients; among these, 131 were intubated. The FOUR total scores(corrected for age) showed superior outcome prediction at 3 months(OR = 0.83; 95% CI = 0.70 to 0.98, P= 0.03) as compared with GCS total scores (OR = 0.85; 95% CI = 0.70 to 1.03, P= 0.09). Conclusions The FOUR scale does not need a verbal response, thus allowing complete testing in intubated patients (in our sample90% of patients showing a GCS V1 score were intubated). Mostimportantly, the FOUR scale demonstrated a better discriminationbetween the good (recovery of independent living) and poorneurological status at 3 months as compared with the GCS.Available online http://ccforum.com/supplements/13/S1S46References 1.

Intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIg) andplasma exchange (PE) are the main treatment in this disease. Thepurpose of this study is to compare the efficacy of IVIg versus PEin the treatment of GBS in a medical ICU.Methods This is a prospective, monocentric, nonrandomized study, realized in the medical ICU of the Ibn Rochd universityhospital of Casablanca, during 5 years (2002 to 2006). Weincluded all patients with GBS who required mechanical ventilation(MV). An electromyogram was realized in all patients and foundaxonal demyelinization. We defined two groups: group 1 (grouptreated by IVIg: 0.4 g/kg/day during 5 days) and group 2 (grouptreated by PE: 4 PEs during 10 to 14 days). We collecteddemographic characteristics, clinical and therapeutic aspects andoutcome. We evaluated the beginning of motility recuperation andMV weaning essentially. The quantitative variables are expressedas the average or median \u00b1 standard deviation, and the qualitativevariables by percentage. The univariate analysis was based on thePearson chi-square test or the Fisher test for the qualitativevariables and the Student test for the quantitative ones. P<0.05 is considered significant. The statistical analysis was based on SPSS11.0 for Windows.Results Forty-one patients (21 in group 1 and 20 in group 2) were enrolled. The mean age was 37 \u00b1 9 years, with a masculinepredominance (75.4%). The mean length of hospitalization was32 days. The length of hospitalization of group 1 was less than thatof group 2 ( P= 0.02). The weaning of MV was more precocious in the patients of group 1 than those of group 2 ( P= 0.01). Also, the beginning of motility recuperation was more precocious in group 1than in group 2 ( P= 0.001). Conclusions Although the results of the literature are not conclusive, our work - of which the most important slant is theabsence of randomization - reveals that there is a meaningfuldifference for MV weaning between the group receiving IVIg inrelation to the PE group. These encouraging results would meritconfirmation by controlled and randomized works. P109 Determinants of critical illness polyneuropathy in the case of long-term ICU treatment A Klimasauskas1, I Sereike1, G 10.1186/cc7273) Introduction Neuromuscular weakness is a condition which is often found during long-term ICU treatment. Critical illness poly-neuropathy (CIP) is the main reason for neuromuscular weakness.Diagnosis of CIP is difficult in the ICU setting. The reasons, even predisposing factors, for CIP are not fully studied. The aim of thisstudy was to analyze whether sedation, duration of ventilation, andduration of ICU stay are good determinants of CIP.Methods A prospective investigation of patients treated in the ICU for longer than 7 days during a 6-month period (1 May 2008 to 31October 2008) was made. All ICU survivors were included in thestudy. The APACHE II scores, first ICU day SOFA scores, durationof sedation, amount of sedation, and duration of ventilation werecalculated. Electroneuromyography was performed for everypatient. Data of patients with (CIP group) and without (controlgroup) CIP were compared.Results Thirty-seven patients were included in the study. In 16 cases CIP was diagnosed (43.2% of patients). The was no agedifference in both groups of patients (55.37 \u00b1 16.5 years in CIPgroup; 51.86 \u00b1 17.92 in control group; P = 0.55). The APACHE II score in the CIP group was high in comparison with the controlgroup - 20.31 \u00b1 7 vs. 15.8 \u00b1 5.89 ( P = 0.04). The CIP group admission-day SOFA score was higher in comparison with thecontrol group - 7.87 \u00b1 4.05 vs. 5.09 \u00b1 2.52 ( P Duration of ICU stay was 20.37 \u00b1 15.54 days in the CIP group and 15.19 \u00b110.95 in the control group ( P = 0.24). Duration of sedation in the CIP group was 118.68 \u00b1 groupwas 94.22 hours ( P = 0.45). in the CIP group was 5,386.8 \u00b1 groupwas 892.25 \u00b1 1,440.97 mg ( P = 0.26). There was no difference in duration of ventilation in both groups (330.62 \u00b1 376.28 hours inCIP group and 159.92 \u00b1 in control group; P = 0.11). Conclusions CIP is often a complication of long-term ICU treatment (43.2% in our ICU). Correlation exists between theAPACHE II score, admission-day SOFA score and development ofCIP in cases of long (>7 days) ICU treatment according to ourresults. No correlation between duration of sedation and venti-lation, volume of sedation, duration of ICU treatment and develop-ment of CIP was found. Larger studies are needed to establish thedeterminants of CIP. P110 Neurally adjusted ventilatory assistance in patients critical polyneuromyopathy D Tuchscherer1, W Z'Graggen1, ventilatory assistance (NAVA) delivers pressure (Paw) in proportion to the electrical activity of thediaphragm (EAdi). It is not known whether EAdi adequately reflectsthe respiratory drive in patients with critical illness polyneuro-myopathy (CIPM) and would be sufficient to deliver assistanceusing NAVA.Methods Fifteen invasively ventilated patients (median (quartiles): 66 (59; 73) years old, APACHE II score 19 (17; 24)) withelectrophysiologically documented CIPM were studied. A level ofadequate unloading (NAVA AL) was identified daily based on the characteristic response in Paw and tidal volume (Vt) to stepwiseincreasing NAVA (titration) as previously described [1]. NAVA AL was used for a maximum of 72 hours.Results NAVA ALwas implemented in 13 patients for 54 (40; 61) hours. Three patients were liberated from mechanical ventilationduring the study. NAVA could not be used in two patients(diaphragm myoclonic; excessive respiratory drive). At NAVA AL peak inspiratory EAdi was reduced by 30 (25; 40)% comparedCritical Care March 2009 Vol 13 Suppl 1 29th International Symposium on Intensive Care and Emergency MedicineS47with the lowest NAVA level used during the titration. The breathing pattern, heart rate, and mean arterial pressure remained stableduring NAVA. See Table 1.Conclusions EAdi was sufficient to use NAVA in most of our patients with moderate to severe CIPM. Implementation of atitrated NAVA level for up to 72 hours resulted in low Vt, improvedoxygenation over time, and stable cardiorespiratory function.Acknowledgement Supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation 3200B0-113478/1.Reference1.

P111 Assessment of muscle membrane properties using muscle velocity recovery cycles in patients with critical illness polyneuromyopathy WJ Z'Graggen1, L Brander2, Jakob2, University Hospital and University of Bern, Switzerland; 2Bern University Hospital and University Hospital, Bern, Switzer- land; 3Institution of Neurology, University College 2009, 13(Suppl 1): P111 (doi: 10.1186/cc7275) Introduction Muscle weakness and atrophy to critical illness polyneuromyopathy (CIPM) is common in long-stay intensive carepatients. Recent nerve excitability studies suggest that therecovery cycle after a single supramaximal stimulus provides usefulinformation about axonal membrane potential and ion channelfunction in neuropathies. We previously found that critical illnesspolyneuropathy is associated with nerve depolarization, and thatthis depolarization is strongly correlated with serum potassium inpatients with renal failure [1]. We have adapted this method tohuman muscle fibres, by measuring the changes in conductionvelocity of muscle fibres [2]. The muscle relative refractory period(RRP) increases and supernormality (SN) decreases in ischaemia,suggesting that these measures may be indicators of membranepotential also in the muscle [2]. The aim of this study was toevaluate muscle RRP and SN in patients with CIPM.Methods Nine patients (age 44 to 73 years) with electrophysio- logically proven CIPM were studied on two occasions within1 week. Multifibre responses to direct muscle stimulation throughneedle electrodes were recorded from the brachioradialis, and thelatency changes measured as conditioning stimuli were applied atinterstimulus intervals of 2 to 1,000 ms. RRP and SN werecompared with an age-matched control group.Results In with CIPM, muscle RRP was abnormally prolonged (6.25 \u00b1 2.74 ms vs. \u00b1 0.45 ms inhealthy \u00b1 3.4%; depolarized in CIPM. If, as we have previously suggested, nerve membrane depolarization is animportant cause of neuropathy in critical illness, it seems likely that muscle membrane depolarization may be an important cause ofmyopathy.

P112 Risk factors for developing hypoglycemia in neurocritical care patients F Van Iersel1, C Tiemessen2, A Slooter2, C Hoedemaekers1, J Van Nijmegen Medical Centre, Nijmegen, the Netherlands; 2University Medical Centre, Utrecht, Netherlands Critical Care 2009, 13(Suppl 1): P112 (doi: 10.1186/cc7276) Introduction The use of intensive insulin therapy (IIT) in neuro- critical care patients is controversial: IIT failed to improve mortalityand morbidity in brain-injury patients in a number of trials.Hypoglycemia increases the risk of death and may contribute tothe development of secondary brain injury in these patients. Theaim of this study was to identify risk factors for hypoglycemia incritically ill neurological patients.Methods We performed a retrospective nested case-control study in the ICU of a tertiary-care teaching hospital in neurologicalICU patients admitted between January 2007 and July 2007.Neurological ICU patients were defined as patients admittedprimarily to the ICU, as a result of their neurological illness.Patients were considered as cases if at least one episode of hypo-glycemia (defined as a glucose level <3.0 mmol/l (<54 mg/dl))occurred while admitted to the ICU. Only the first hypoglycemicevent (index moment) of a patient was used to match with a controlpatient. Control patients were randomly selected from the samepopulation, admitted for at least the same duration until the indexmoment, without previous hypoglycemic events. A number ofpotential risk factors for the development of hypoglycemia werepredefined based on the literature in ICU patients. All variableswere analyzed with univariate and multivariate regression analysis,correcting for age, gender and APACHE II score.Results Of the 127 neurological ICU patients, 35 developed hypoglycemia (27.6%). Mean arterial pressure (OR = 0.93; 95%CI = 0.87 to 0.99 per increase of 1 mmHg), having a Sepsis-related Organ Failure Assessment score for hemodynamicinstability 1 (OR = 5.53; 95% CI = 1.23 to 24.81), dosage of norepinephrine (OR = 8.39; 95% CI = 1.38 to 51.12 increaseof 1 clearance (OR = 0.98; CI = 0.96 to1.00 per increase of 1 ml/min) and gastric residual volume withoutadjusting the insulin dosage (OR = 11.66; 95% CI = 1.24 to109.20) were independently associated with a risk for developinghypoglycemia.Available online http://ccforum.com/supplements/13/S1 Table 1 (abstract P110) Mean predicted (breaths/min) 286) 36 (30; 45) 5.6 (3.4; 7.8) 6.7 (5.8; 8.3) 30 (2.9; 6.6) 6.5 (5.4; 7.6) 27 (22; 35) Data presented as median (quartiles). * P <0.05 vs. day 1.S48Conclusions Hypoglycemia occurs in a significant proportion of neurological ICU patients.

P113 Relationship between effective osmolality changes and neurological status during treatment for severe paediatric diabetic ketoacidosis S Tibby, A Durward, L Ferguson, H Bangalore, I Hospital, complication of paediatric diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). Several riskfactors at presentation are known, including urea, and pCO 2. It has recently been suggested that changes in effective osmolalityduring treatment may also convey risk, but this has not beenconfirmed due to a lack of prospective data.Methods A prospective observational study over 24 hours of 50 children admitted to a regional ICU with severe DKA (median pH atpresentation 6.90). Development of cerebral oedema was definedclinically as a deterioration in Glaser score of >2 points during the24 hours after presentation (equating to a Glasgow coma scale <8to 10). Changes in effective osmolality, uncorrected and correctedsodium were modelled using linear (random coefficients) mixedmodels, with adjustment for baseline covariates of urea and pCO 2. Results Consistent with previous studies, baseline urea was higher and pCO2lower in patients who subsequently showed neurological deterioration. All three osmolality variables (effectiveosmolality, uncorrected and corrected sodium) were similar atbaseline between the two groups. The best-fitting model utilizedcorrected sodium (lowest Akaike information criterion). Thisshowed a significant interaction effect ( P= 0.01), in that corrected sodium increased over time at a rate of 0.35 mmol/l/hour inpatients who did not develop neurological symptoms, but did notchange in those who did.Conclusions Lack of change in corrected sodium is associated with neurological deterioration in the treatment of severe DKA in children.This variable may be useful if incorporated into treatment guidelines. P114 Continuous monitoring of blood parameters in intensive care patients A Weinstein1, O Herzenstein1, E Gabis1, (doi: 10.1186/cc7278) Introduction Monitoring of blood parameters, such as glucose, hemoglobin and oxygen saturation, is essential in critically illpatients. The current invasive methods are not frequent enough forefficient tight glycemic control, and result in a high rate ofhypoglycemia. In addition, there is a growing need for a continuoushemoglobin measurement in postoperative care units and ICUs.The purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of the fullynoninvasive blood monitor (NBM device; OrSense Ltd, Nes Ziona,Israel) for continuous monitoring of glucose, hemoglobin andoxygen saturation in critically ill patients.Methods The study was conducted on 14 patients (seven female, seven male, ages 34 to 92 years) in the ICU of the Rabin MedicalCenter, upon receipt of informed consent. The NBM probe wasplaced on patients' thumbs, where it performed measurements for up to 24 hours, with readings every 10 minutes. Patient compli-ance was good and no adverse effects were identified. The resultsobtained from the NBM device were compared with blood samplestaken through an arterial line every 30 to 60 minutes and wereanalyzed with a blood gas machine (ABL 700; Radiometer,Copenhagen, Denmark).Results A total of 208 paired data points were obtained in the trial. At each point, an algorithm based on a uniform model (withpersonal glucose calibration) was used to calculate the three bloodparameters. The reference glucose range was 62 to 369 mg/dl.The median relative absolute difference was 7.3%, and a Clarkeerror grid analysis showed that 95.2% of the measurements fellwithin zones A (74.5%) and B (20.7%). The reference range of thehemoglobin was 7 to 14.5 g/dl and the median absolute errorobtained was 1 g/dl. Oxygen saturation levels were tracked simul-taneously with a mean error of 2.5%.Conclusions The present study indicates the potential use of the noninvasive NBM for continual, accurate, safe, and easy-to-usemultiparameter monitoring in critically ill patients. The device holdsthe promise of improving patient care and survival, as well asreducing staff workload. P115 Morning glucose correlates poorly with daily mean glucose in cardiac surgical ICU patients: impact of ultradian variation of glucose D Hagg, S Smith, K Oveson, M Slater, H Song, A Ahmann OHSU, Care 10.1186/cc7279) Introduction Treatment of hyperglycemia with an insulin infusion protocol (IIP) has improved outcomes in ICU and cardiac surgerypatients [1]. Many studies have reported morning glucose valuesas representative of whole-day glucose control. We recentlydemonstrated that in a mixed ICU population this assumption doesnot hold [2]. Since it has been proposed that glucose control maybe especially important in cardiac surgery ICU patients, we askedwhether morning glucose accurately represented whole-dayglucose and determined whether glucose varied over the course ofthe day in this patient group.Methods A prospective, observational single-center study in the cardiac surgical ICU of a university tertiary-care hospital. Allglucose measurements in cardiac surgical ICU patients receivingan IIP targeting blood glucose 80 to 110 mg/dl were recordedfrom 1 June 2006 to 28 February 2007.Results We recorded 12,109 glucose measurements from 125 patients on IIPs. The glucose measurements were widelydistributed with 9% and 2% in the ranges<60, 61 to 79, 80 to 110, 111 to 150, 151 to 200 and>200 mg/dl, respectively. After 8 hours of IIP, the proportion ofvalues in the target range increased to 49%. The 06:00-hourglucose values were lower than other values (mean \u00b1 SD: 105 \u00b124 <0.0001). were poorly correlated with the average glucoserecorded for the remainder of the day ( r 2= 0.029), which was confirmed by Bland-Altman analysis. The time-averaged glucosedata exhibited ultradian variation, peaking at 10:00 and 19:00hours. The insulin dose varied with a similar pattern.Conclusions In cardiothoracic ICU patients receiving an IIP, glucose exhibited an ultradian pattern with peaks at 10:00 and19:00 hours, and was lower in the early morning than during theremainder of the day. Consideration of this ultradian variation mayavoid hypoglycemic and hyperglycemic episodes and so facilitateCritical Care March 2009 Vol 13 Suppl 1 29th International Symposium on Intensive Care and Emergency MedicineS49better glucose control with an IIP.

P116 Hypoglycaemia is associated with a higher mortality in critically ill patients A Jose Pereira1, A Biasi Cavalcanti1, F Introduction Hypoglycaemia, a common complication of strict glucose control in critically ill patients, has controversial effects onmortality. The hyperglycaemic index (HGI) takes into account theunequal time distribution of blood glucose sampling and is a betterpredictor of death than other methods to quantify hyperglycaemia[1]. By analogy with the HGI, we defined the hypoglycaemic index(HGI-60) as the area above the glucose curve and lower than60 mg/dl divided by the length of ICU stay. The objective of thestudy was to evaluate the effects of hypoglycaemia on inhospitalmortality in critical care patients using a new method for quanti- fication of hypoglycaemia, the hypoglycaemic index (HGI-60).Methods A retrospective study performed in four mixed ICUs. From 2004 through 2006, patients treated with continuous insulintherapy were included. Admission type, sex, age, the occurrence ofhypoglycaemia <60 mg/dl, APACHE II score and outcome(hospital dead) were recorded. The HGI-60 is calculated aftersimple interpolation of all glucose values measured during the ICUstay. The relations between independent variables and hospitalmortality were determined by logistic regression analysis.Results One hundred and ninety-six patients were included. The mean age was 60.5 years and 56% were male. The meanAPACHE II score was 22.8 and the hospital mortality was 51.5%.The HGI-60 median was 0.02 mg/dl/hour (interquartile range 0 to0.13) in survivors versus range 0 to0.23) in nonsurvivors ( P= 0.01). Results of logistic regression analysis show that HGI-60 was associated with higher hospitalmortality independently of the APACHE II score (OR = 7.2; 95%CI = 1.6 to 32.1; P= 0.009). The HGI-60 had a higher area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (0.70) than theoccurrence of hypoglycaemia (0.67).Conclusions Hypoglycaemia during the ICU stay is a marker of increased mortality. The hypoglycaemic index (HGI-60) is a betterpredictor of mortality than the occurrence of hypoglycaemia.Reference1.

The problem resolved when reverting to a syringe. An ex vivo experiment confirmed variable adsorption to syringes burettes.Methods Postulating insulin adsorption to the infusion inline burette as the cause of this excessively high insulin requirement,we confirmed by an in vitro experiment with (a) a Terumo \u00aesyringe with B-Braun extension tubing and (b) a B-Braun Dosifix\u00aeinline burette system. Neutral insulin (Actrapid) with a concentration of1 unit in 1 ml isotonic sodium chloride was run at 10 units/hour.The insulin concentration at the point of exit from the infusionsystem was analysed periodically (Table 1).Results Immediately after priming, there was approximately a 56% loss of insulin from the solution being delivered from the burettesystem, compared with 37% from the syringe system. Thissyringe-burette variability persisted throughout our study. At9 hours, there had been an 81% loss of insulin from the burettesystem compared with 47% from the syringe. A second similarexperiment also confirmed this observation.Conclusions Data on stability of insulin solutions and infusion systems are sparse. The insulin concentration is affected morewhen administered via inline burette infusion sets compared withsyringe pump infusion lines [1]. When managing hyperglycaemia,apart from endogenous causes and true insulin resistance asreasons for escalating insulin requirements, insulin adsorption tothe infusion systems should also be considered. More studies arerequired to elucidate this further.Reference1. Corallo C, et al.: Aus Hosp Pharm 1995, 25:129-135.

Patients were evaluated at early (E) phase and late (L) phase(1 week after E phase). The number of patients was 83, amongwhich 67 patients with daily mean BG (BGm) below 200 mg/dlwere selected, because patients with BGm above 200 mg/dl hadAvailable online http://ccforum.com/supplements/13/S1 Table 1 (abstract mortality, or 56%. They were classified into two groups, a group with high BG variability and a group without, based on the daily standard deviation of BG (BGsd). The two groups were compared regarding the following items: (1) mortality; (2) BGm, daily maximal daily BG difference (BGd); (3) demographic data; (4) administered glucose and insulin; and (5) degree of organ dysfunction and SOFA score. Results ( 1) In the E phase, patients with BGsd above 14 mg/dl (group H, n= 26, mean BGsd 25 \u00b1 11) had significantly higher mortality (46% vs. 17%) as compared with those with BGsd below 14 mg/dl (group N, n= 41, mean BGsd 9 \u00b1 3). In the L phase, mortality was not significantly different between the groups with higher BGsd and those with lower BGsd at any point. (2) There was no significant difference in BGm between group H and group N (173 \u00b1 24 vs. 173 \u00b1 15). (3) BGmax and BGd in group H were significantly higher than those in group N (228 \u00b1 42 vs. 191 \u00b1 18, and 93 \u00b1 39 vs. 37 \u00b1 14, respectively). BGmin in group H was significantly lower than that in group N (132 \u00b1 28 vs. 154 \u00b1 16). (4) There was no significant difference in the abovementioned another items between group H and group N. Conclusions High BG variability in the acute phase proved to be one of the highest risk factors. Therefore, strict BG control focusing on stabilization of BG variability especially in the acute phase was considered one of the important therapies. The AP was most reliable and therefore useful for clarifying the significance of strict BG control, and strict BG control using an AP should be considered in order to obtain the better outcome. P119 Effect of increasing intravenous glucose load in the presence of normoglycemia on outcome and metabolism in critically ill rabbits S Derde, I Vanhorebeek, E Ververs, V Darras, E Van Herck, G Van den Berghe Catholic University Belgium 2009, 13(Suppl 1): P119 (doi: 10.1186/cc7283) Introduction Endocrine disturbances during critical illness lead to a feeding-resistant wasting syndrome, characterised by profound protein breakdown, promoting delayed recovery and poor outcome. Parenteral nutrition failed to counteract the hypercata- bolic state, possibly due to aggravation of the detrimental hyper- glycemic response to critical illness. In our rabbit model of prolonged critical illness we investigated the impact of varying intravenous glucose load, while maintaining normoglycemia, on mortality, organ damage, and catabolism/anabolism. Methods Critically ill rabbits were randomised into a fasting group, a standard parenteral nutrition group, and two groups receiving either an intermediate or high additional amount of intravenous glucose within the physiological range, all maintained normo- glycemic with insulin. These normoglycemic groups were com- pared with a hyperglycemic group (similar high glucose load as the last normoglycemic group) and with healthy rabbits. Protein and lipid load was equal for all fed groups. Results Varying intravenous glucose load did not affect the mortality or organ damage, provided normoglycemia was main- tained. Fasted critically ill rabbits lost weight, which was attenuated by increasing intravenous glucose load. As compared with healthy rabbits, mRNA expression of several components of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway was elevated in skeletal muscle of fasted critically ill rabbits, which was counteracted by intravenous feeding. Except in the normoglycemic group with intermediate glucose load, circulating insulin-like growth factor 1 and thyroidhormone levels decreased in all groups, most pronounced in hyperglycemic rabbits. Conclusions Provided normoglycemia is maintained, increasing intravenous glucose within the physiological range is safe for organ function and survival of critically ill rabbits and reduces catabolism compared with fasting. P120 Reduction of glucose and insulin concentrations during in vitro incubation of whole blood S Beitland, H Opdahl, T Aspelin, L Saetre, T Lyberg Ullevaal 13(Suppl 1): P120 (doi: 10.1186/cc7284) Introduction Incubation of whole blood has been used in numerous in vitro investigations. The purpose of the present study was to test the hypothesis that glucose and insulin concentrations declined during incubation. Methods Six young, healthy and fasting males donated blood. Aliquots containing heparin-anticoagulated whole blood were added to with different quantities of insulin (Actrapid; Novo Nordisk, Bagsvaerd, Denmark) and bacterial endotoxin (Escherichia Laboratories, Detroit, Aliquots were incubated for 6 hours at 37\u00b0C in an atmosphere of humidified 5% CO2and 95% air. Concentrations of blood glucose were measured every hour, whereas insulin was measured at baseline and 6 hours. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to compare medians. Results The glucose concentration in aliquots to which insulin 30 nmol/l and lipopolysaccharide 1,000 ng/ml were added decreased linearly and approached zero after 6 hours (median 0.6 vs. 4.75 mmol/l, P = 0.027; presented as a line chart of medians with range in Figure 1). The insulin content in blood samples without any additions was reduced by more than 50% during incubation (median 22.5 vs. 48.0 pmol/l, P = 0.028; depicted as box plots with median lines, 25th to 75th percentile boxes and 10th to 90th percentile error bars in Figure 1). Similar glucose and insulin measurements were performed during incubation of other selected aliquots. The reductions of glucose and insulin content were analogous to the results above; the magnitude of reduction seemed to be independent of the addition of insulin and/or lipopolysaccharide.Critical Care March 2009 Vol 13 Suppl 1 29th International Symposium on Intensive Care and Emergency Medicine Figure 1 (abstract P120) Glucose and insulin concentrations during incubation. S51Conclusions The concentration of glucose was reduced to almost zero during 6 hours of incubation; the decline was probably due toglycolysis in blood cells rather than the effects of insulin. Theresulting hypoglycaemia may affect cellular functions, and additionof glucose should therefore be performed during in vitro incubations. The decline in insulin content was unexpected, asinsulin is mostly degraded in the liver and kidney, but to someextent also in blood cells and extracellularly. P121 Surprising result after evaluating a nurse-driven guideline on blood glucose management R Schnabel, J Zwaveling, D Bergmans Maastricht University 1): P121 (doi: 10.1186/cc7285) Introduction Whether blood glucose management is a cornerstone in reducing ICU mortality is still under debate.Nevertheless, conscientious glucose regulation by intensive insulintherapy has become an indicator in the evaluation of the medicalquality of ICUs in the Netherlands. In recent years, however, therehave been several reports of increased hypoglycemic events andclinical harm due to stringent glucose regulation [1].The general ICU in our hospital consists of two units with acomparable patient population with separate nursing staff but thesame medical staff. Both units work with the same nurse-drivenguideline for the blood glucose management providing some liberty inthe decision-making process. The frequency of glucose measurementwith a point-of-care device is left to the nurses' discretion. A glucoselevel of 4.5 to 7 mmol/l was set as the target value on both wards.Methods After 2 years the total number of tests done on each ward, the achieved average glucose level, and the number ofhypoglycemic events (glucose <2.5 mmol/l) and hyperglycemicevents according to our hospital laboratorydatabase were evaluated.Results Unit 1 had a total of 700 patients with 5,717 ICU-days and performed 27,218 tests according to an average of 4.8tests/patient/day. Unit 1 achieved an average glucose level of6.9 mmol/l with 0.6% hypoglycemia and 32% hyperglycemia. Unit2 had total of 504 patients with 5,384 ICU-days and performed39,400 tests according to an average of 7.3 tests/patient/day. Unit2 achieved an average glucose level of 6.4 mmol/l with 0.9%hypoglycemia and 20% hyperglycemia.Conclusions Using a nurse-driven protocol, both units achieved comparable and satisfying average glucose levels with acceptablenumbers of hypoglycemic events. There was a striking difference inthe number of tests performed between the two wards dependingon interpretation of the same guideline.Reference1.

P122 Evaluation of nursing perceptions about three insulin protocols for blood glucose control in critical care T Correa, F Pereira de Almeida, A Biasi Cavalcanti, A Jose Pereira, E (doi: 10.1186/cc7286) Introduction To implement a tight glycemic control protocol in the ICU, it is essential to obtain active nurse involvement [1,2]. Ourobjective was to evaluate nurses' perceptions about three different blood glucose control protocols for critically ill patients.Methods As part of a randomized control trial comparing three blood glucose control protocols in ICU patients, we issued aquestionnaire to all nurses who participated in the study toevaluate their perception on protocol efficacy, benefits, safety,risks, feasibility and a question asking which protocol the nurseswould like to be adopted in their ICU. The randomized control trialarms were: a computer-assisted insulin protocol (CAIP) withcontinuous insulin infusion to maintain blood glucose between 100and 130 mg/dl; a Leuven protocol with insulin infusion to maintainblood glucose between 80 and 110 mg/dl; and conventionaltreatment with subcutaneous insulin if glucose >150 mg/dl.Results Sixty nurses answered the questionnaires. The CAIP was considered the most efficient by 57% of the nurses. About 58% ofthe nurses evaluated its performance as good or very good,compared with 22% for the Leuven protocol treatment ( P= 0.08). The CAIP was considered easier to use than the Leuven protocol ( P<0.001) and as easy as conventional treatment ( P= 0.78). Fifty-six percent of the nurses chose the CAIP as the protocol they would like to be adopted intheir institution.Conclusions The CAIP was more efficacious, safer and easier to use than the Leuven protocol. Compared with conventionaltreatment, the feasibility and safety of the CAIP were consideredsimilar. Most nurses chose the CAIP as the protocol they wouldlike to be adopted in their ICU.References1.

Weuse a nurse-wise insulin titration protocol for TGC in our ICU. Thepurpose of this study was to examine the impact of a simplecomputer alert on the quality of TGC.Methods An alert was created with the EventManager \u00aeof MetaVision\u00ae. The nurses received a pop-up message on the bedside workstation, with a simple suggestion for the timing of thenext measurement and a nonspecific instruction to check caloricintake and insulin dose, at the following was sent to all workstations,and to both doctors and nurses. The alert was implemented on 1August 2007. We performed an observational cohort study,including all adults (>18 years) who were in our ICU between 31January and 31 July 2007 (control group, n= 731), and between 31 August 2007 and 6 February 2008 (alert group, n= 654). StatView \u00aewas used for statistical analysis. Results The mean BG per patient, the glycemic penalty index (GPI) [2] and the hyperglycaemic index (HGI) [3] were significantlylower after implementation of the alert. There were fewer patientsin the alert group who experienced at least one episode of BGAvailable online http://ccforum.com/supplements/13/S1S52<40 mg/dl. The amount of BG samples drawn per patient was similar in both groups (Table 1).Conclusions Even in an environment where TGC is performed well, a simple computer alert can further improve BG level controland reduce the risk of hypoglycemia, without increasing the BGsample rate.References1.

P124 Which variables affect strict glycaemic control with intensive insulin therapy in postoperative/post-traumatic critically ill patients? M Weiss1, M Kron2, (doi: 10.1186/cc7288) Introduction This study was performed to determine the effect variables supposed to affect optimal blood glucose concentrationsbetween 80 and 150 mg/dl in postoperative/post-traumatic patients.Methods From January 2007 to December 2007, 826 post- operative/post-traumatic critically ill patients admitted to auniversity adult ICU performing intensive insulin therapy weresurveyed daily using computer assistance with respect to minimaland maximal daily blood glucose concentrations and insulintherapy. The variables age, sex, sepsis, neurosurgical patient,steroids, adrenaline and/or noradrenaline infusion rate, acute renalfailure, liver function assessed by the Model of Endstage LiverDisease score [1], organ dysfunctions reflected by the SequentialOrgan Failure Assessment score [2], and severity of disease by theSimplified Acute Physiology Score II [3] were monitored.Results Seven hundred and sixty-four patients with an ICU stay >48 hours were eligible for evaluation. In multiple logisticregression with backward elimination to determine the mostrelevant parameters, sepsis (OR = 1.2, with corresponding 95%CI = 1.1 to 1.4), neurosurgical patients (OR = 1.6, CI = 1.3 to1.9), steroids (OR = 1.5, CI = 1.2 to 1.9), noradrenaline infusion(OR = 1.4, 95% CI = 1.2 to 1.6), and age (per year) (OR = 1.02, CI = 1.01 to 1.02) were associated with an increased risk not tolay within an optimal blood glucose range of 80 to 150 mg/dl(P<0.01). Conclusions Sepsis, neurosurgery, steroids, catecholamine infusions and age may be associated with increased risk fordifficult blood glucose control in postoperative/post-traumaticpatients.References1.

P125 Comparison of conventional measures of glucose control versus the area under the curve from a continuous glucose monitoring device in critical care patients K Fitousis, M Sirimaturos, S Mannan, D Hamilton, S Hendricks, M (doi: 10.1186/cc7289) Introduction In critical illness, hyperglycemia is a frequent complication resulting from metabolic and hormonal changes.Recent findings suggest increased glycemic variability may confera strong independent risk of mortality in the critically ill [1].Conventional measurements of glucose control include morningglucose, mean daily glucose, percentage of glucose readings inthe goal range, and the hyperglycemic index (HGI) [2]. Theobjective of this study was to determine the most appropriatemethod for assessing glycemic control in cardiovascular (CV)surgery patients.Methods Data were obtained from a continuous glucose monitor- ing system (Medtronic CGMS \u00aeSystem Gold; Medtronic Diabetes, Northridge, CA, USA) database containing continuousglucose monitoring system, fingerstick, and morning laboratoryblood glucose values from adult CV ICU patients. A total of 23patients contributed to the dataset. The area under the curve every24 hours was calculated to determine the HGI. The mean andmedian daily glucose, percentage of glucose readings within andabove the goal range (80 to 115 mg/dl) and the mean morningglucose were calculated.

Exogenous GLP-1 lowers blood glucose concentrations in both healthy humans and patients with type 2 diabetes, via suppression of glucagon, stimulation of insulin secretion and slowing gastric emptying. As the humoral effects are glucose dependent, the use of GLP-1 is not associated with hypo- glycaemia. The effects of GLP-1 on glycaemia in critical illness have hitherto not been evaluated. Methods Seven, nondiabetic, critically ill patients (four males, three females; age 58 \u00b1 6 years) received, on two separate days, intravenous GLP-1 (1.2 pmol/kg/min) or placebo between t= 0 and 270 minutes, in randomised double-blind fashion. Between t= 30 and 270 minutes a liquid nutrient was infused intra- duodenally at a rate of 1.5 kcal/min. Blood glucose, plasma insulin and glucagon concentrations were measured. Data are presented as the mean \u00b1 SEM. Statistical analyses were performed using the paired t test or repeated-measures ANOVA. Results Compared with placebo, GLP-1 decreased peak glucose concentrations (10.1 \u00b1 0.7 mmol/l vs. 12.7 \u00b1 1.1 mmol/l; P= 0.01) and markedly attenuated the overall glycaemic response to enteral nutrition (blood glucose area under the curve 30 to 270 min, 2,077 \u00b1 145 mmol/l/240 min (Figure 1). GLP-1 caused but nonsustained, suppression of plasma glucagon concentrations ( t= 30 min, 90 \u00b1 12 pmol/ml 104 \u00b1 10 pmol/ml; P <0.01) and tended toincrease the plasma insulin/blood glucose ratio (between t= 0 and 270 min, mean insulin/glucose ratio 5.0 \u00b1 2.0 mU/mmol vs. 2.5 \u00b1 0.9 P= Acute, GLP-1 infusion markedly attenuates the glycaemic response to enteral nutrition in the critically ill.

A retrospective cohort study A Stoszkova, P Dostal, V Cerny University Hospital Hradec 2009, 13(Suppl 1): P127 (doi: 10.1186/cc7291) Introduction Recent recommendations on tight glucose control in general critically ill patients questioned its effect on patient outcome [1,2]. The aim of our work is to determine whether the implementation of tight glucose control to our practice improved our patients' outcome. Methods In this retrospective cohort study we used baseline data from our intensive care register. An intravenous insulin protocol to maintain tight glucose control was implemented in our practice on 6 June 2003. In the study we enrolled patients admitted to our six- bed multidisciplinary ICU over a 2-year period before (years 2001 and 2002 - group with usual glucose control) and a 2-year period after (years 2004 and 2005 - group with tight glucose control) the introduction of tight glucose control. In total 231 adult mecha- nically ventilated patients, admitted primarily or within the first 24 hours to our ICU, were included. We recorded the length of ICU stay, length of artificial ventilation, cost, APACHE II and SOFA scores, and examined the incidence of nosocomial infections and mortality in both groups of critically ill patients. Results One hundred and fifteen patients in the group with usual glucose control and 116 patients in the group with tight glucose control were analyzed; no significant difference on severity of disease in both groups (APACHE II score 23.7 vs. 24.14, P= 0.765 and SOFA score 7.9 vs. 7.8, P= 0.743) was detected. Tight glucose control was associated with a significant reduction of nosocomial pneumonia (20% vs. 11%, OR = 0.34, 95% CI = 0.19 to 0.86). There was no significant difference in hospital mortality, length of stay, artificial ventilation and cost. Conclusions Tight glucose control was associated with a significant reduction of nosocomial pneumonia, but not with a reduction of hospital mortality, length of stay, artificial ventilation and hospital cost.

P128 Should we treat children with hyperglycaemia with insulin after cardiac surgery? H Zwart, A Struijs, Verhoeven, K Joosten 13(Suppl 1): P128 (doi: 10.1186/cc7292) Introduction Critically ill infants and children often develop hyperglycaemia. In adults it is associated with worsened outcome.Available online http://ccforum.com/supplements/13/S1 Figure 1 (abstract P126) Glycaemic response to enteral nutrition is markedly attenuated (***P<0.02). S54No studies have so far investigated the feasibility and outcome of a standardized insulin/glucose protocol in children with congenitalheart disease after cardiac surgery.Methods We prospectively studied children with congenital heart disease after cardiac surgery, for glucose intake, concomitantblood glucose values and results of insulin treatment. Results areexpressed as the median and range, P <0.05 considered statistically significant.Results Eighty-nine children were evaluated (male 56.2%), age 0.9 years (1 day to 17.9 years), length of ICU stay 22 hours (2.5 to28.0 hours). All children survived. Fifty children were treated withand 39 without insulin. Overall, first blood glucose on admission tothe ICU was 5.7 mmol/l (3.1 to 21.6 mmol/l), after 6 hours was8.2 mmol/l (4.7 to 23.0 mmol/l), highest blood glucose was9.9 mmol/l (3.4 to 23.7 mmol/l), and 77.5% was hyperglycaemicduring admission (>8.0 mmol/l). Fifty out of the 70 children withhyperglycaemia were treated with insulin. Time to reach normo-glycaemia in insulin-treated children was 6.4 hours (0.3 to17.2 hours), total length of insulin treatment was 11.9 hours (2.3 to23.0 hours) and the length of hyperglycaemia was 6.7 hours (1.2to 17.0 hours) (Table 1). The duration of hyperglycaemia of treatedand untreated children was not significantly different. Hypogly-caemia (<4.0 mmol/l) occurred in 10 children (11.2%); none ofthem had severe hypoglycaemia (<2.2 mmol/l).Conclusions This study shows that a majority (77.5%) of children admitted after cardiac surgery develops hyperglycaemia and72.5% were treated with insulin. The duration of hyperglycaemiawas not different between children with or without insulintreatment. It can be questioned whether beneficial effects of insulintherapy can be expected with the short duration of insulintreatment (11.9 hours), which was noticed in this study. P129 Effect of glucose-insulin-potassium infusion on mortality in critically ill patients: a systematic review and meta- analysis M Puskarich1, A Jones1, J Kline1, M Trzeciak2 1Carolinas Medical Center, Charlotte, NC, USA; 2Cooper USACritical P129 (doi: 10.1186/cc7293) Introduction Fifty years' worth of published evidence has inferred benefits of glucose-insulin-potassium (GIK) infusion to critically illpatients. We sought to measure the treatment effect of GIKinfusion on mortality in critically ill patients.Methods We conducted a systematic review of the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, conference proceedings,clinical practice guidelines, and other sources using acomprehensive strategy. We identified randomized controlled trialscomparing GIK treatment with standard care or placebo in criticallyill adult patients. The primary outcome variable was mortality. Twoauthors independently extracted data and assessed study qualityusing standardized instruments; consensus was reached byconference. Preplanned subgroup analysis included studies of high-quality methodology, septic shock or other circulatory shockpopulations. We used the chi-square test and the proportion oftotal variation in study estimates that is due to heterogeneity ( I 2)t o assess for statistical heterogeneity ( P<0.10, I2>25%). The primary analysis was based on the random effects model toproduce pooled ORs with 95% CIs.Results The search yielded 1,720 potential publications; 23 studies were included in the final analysis, providing a sample of22,525 patients. Included studies only contained populations ofacute myocardial infarction and cardiovascular surgery patients.The combined significantheterogeneity ( P= 0.57, I 2= 0%) and no mortality (OR = 1.02; 95% CI = 0.93 to 1.11) with GIK treatment. Among the high-quality studies ( n= 4) there was no effect on mortality (OR = 1.04; 95% CI = 0.95 to 1.14). No experimental studies of shock orsepsis populations were identified.Conclusions This meta-analysis found that there is no mortality benefit to GIK infusion in critically ill patients; however, studypopulations were limited to acute myocardial infarction andcardiovascular surgery patients. No studies were identified utilizingGIK in patients with septic shock or other forms of circulatoryshock, providing an absence of evidence regarding the effect ofGIK as a therapy in patients with shock. P130 Incidence and risk factors of hypertriglyceridemia in the ICU MR Shams1, N Tavassoli2, N linear correlation between serum triglyceride and risk of intensive care mortality was identified. Various clinical andmetabolic situations such as sepsis, renal failure, hepatic failureand administration of certain drugs have been associated withhypertriglyceridemia (HTG). It is well known that HTG isassociated with acute pancreatitis. Development of systemicinflammatory response syndrome or the onset of organ systemdysfunction are the complications of severe acute pancreatitis thatis an episode of acute pancreatitis. The aim of this study was todetermine the incidence of HTG in patients receiving artificialnutrition in an ICU, to describe their characteristics and toestablish the relevance of risk factors associated with HTG.Methods A prospective, observational, cohort study performed in a general ICU of Toulouse University Hospital, Toulouse, France from1 May 2007 to 31 July 2008. We included consecutive intensivecare patients with an initial serum triglyceride level less than3 mmol/l who received at least 7 days of artificial nutrition and withat least three biochemical serum triglyceride analyses with a1-week interval.

The incidence ofHTG was calculated as 17.9% per year. Multivariate analysisidentified three independent risk factors age = 1.27).Conclusions The present study showed that ICU-admitted patients receiving artificial nutrition are prone to develop HTG.Hepatic failure and the insulin infusion rate were the mostimportant risk factors for HTG. Age had a protective effect. Ourresults raise three important matters: (1) serum triglyceridemeasurement is necessary in seriously ill patients receiving artificialnutrition; (2) elevated triglycerides reflect the degree of insulinresistance and severity of critical illness; and (3) the hyper-triglyceridemic profile of young patients admitted to the ICU is veryimportant to consider. P131 Abstract withdrawn P132 Should perioperative immune-modulating nutrition therapy be the standard of care? A systematic review LB Weitzel1, R Dhaliwal2, 1University Colorado, Aurora, CO, Care 2009, 13(Suppl 1): P132 (doi: 10.1186/cc7296) Introduction Major surgery carries a significant risk of post- operative infections, such as surgical site infections. An estimated500,000 surgical site infections occur annually at a cost of morethe $1 billion/year in the US alone. Surgical trauma leads to aninitial excessive inflammatory response, together with an almostimmediate and dramatic depression of cell-mediated immunity. Thisimmnosuppression may be due to a significant decrease in plasmaarginine levels observed following surgery. This arginine deficiencycan severely impair T-cell proliferation and key T-cell receptorfunction. Perioperative arginine administration can prevent argininedeficiency and restore cellular immunity. The purpose of this meta-analysis was to examine the relationship between immune-modulating enteral nutrition therapy (IMENT) containing arginineand infectious complications, length of stay, and mortality rates insurgical patients.Methods All prospective randomized controlled trials of arginine- containing IMENT versus standard enteral nutrition in surgicalpatients conducted from 1990 to 2008 were identified from multiple databases. Studies included in the analysis evaluatedinfectious complication, length of stay, and/or mortality rates.Methodological quality of individual studies was scored andnecessary data were abstracted in duplicate and independently.Results Thirty randomized trials with a total of 2,789 patients compared the use of arginine-containing IMENT with standardenteral nutrition in surgical patients. Arginine-containing IMENTsignificantly decreased infectious complications (relative risk =0.58, 95% CI = 0.48 to 0.69, P <0.00001) and overall length of stay (weighted mean difference = -2.09, 95% CI = -3.20 to-0.97, P= 0.0002) versus standard enteral nutrition. As expected in a low-mortality surgical population, however, no effect wasobserved on mortality (relative risk = 1.06, 95% CI = 0.60 to 1.80,P= 0.84). Conclusions The cumulative results show that arginine-containing IMENT significantly reduces overall infections and length of stay insurgical patients. Based on this evidence, arginine-containingIMENT could soon become the standard of care in the surgicalpatient. This large treatment effect demands definitive evaluation ina large multicenter trial.

In theory, plasma citrulline, formed when arginine by NO synthase, and when ADMA is metabolized, wouldbe lowered and ornithine, formed by the degradation of arginine inthe urea cycle, would be potentially elevated when ADMAaccumulates as in sepsis and in liver failure [1].Methods Fourteen male Wistar rats were randomly allocated to after 5 mg/kg LPS and HH, respectively.Results See Table 1. Conclusions Plasma levels of arginine and derivatives should not be interpreted as a reflection of metabolism at the tissue level. InHH, the elevated ADMA levels suggest dimethylarginine dimethyl-aminohydrolase activity depends on the liver tissue mass.Reference1. Wu G, et al.: Arginine metabolism: nitric oxide and beyond.

We studiedthe effect of ginger supplementation to the diet on development ofventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and adult respiratorydistress syndrome (ARDS) in ICU patients [2].Methods In a prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled fashion, 32 ARDS mechanically ventilated patients who were fed entrallywere studied. Patients were randomized into two groups; onegroup had ginger added and the other had placebo added to theirenteral feeding. The amount of feeding tolerated in the first48 hours, the amount of feeding tolerated during the entire studyperiod, development of VAP, the number of ICU-free days, thenumber of ventilator-free days and morality were evaluated.Results Enteral feeding tolerated in the first 48 hours of study was significantly higher in patients with the ginger-supplemented diet(51% vs. 57%, P<0.005). However this was not different during the entire study period (92% vs. 93%, P= 0.42). VAP was seen in 6.3% of the patients in the ginger group and in 31.3% of thecontrol group, which was not statistically significant ( P= 0.08). The ICU mortality of 15.6% was similar in the two groups. Themedian number of ventilator-free days of 10 versus 7 days andICU-free days of 7 versus 4 days were significantly higher in theginger extract group, with respective Pvalues of 0.02 and 0.04. Conclusions Supplementing the diet with ginger extract in ARDS patients reduces the delayed gastric emptying risk and helpsreduce the duration of mechanical ventilation and increases ICU-free days.References1.

Weused a cell culture model of epithelial barrier dysfunction to deter-mine whether liver cytosolic proteins could decrease NO \u0081 production and preserve enterocyte exposed TNF cells. Arginase activity in cell supernatants and murine serum was measured by following thegeneration of citrulline and urea from arginase. Tissue lysates andconditioned media were untreated or treated enzymeinhibitors (BEC) and L-N(6)-(1- and of iNOS and release of NO \u0081. LC protein (400 g/ml) applied to the basal but not apical compartment preserved barrier function and completely blocked the release ofNO \u0081but only slightly decreased the magnitude of iNOS protein expression in a dose-dependent and time-dependent manner.Ultrafiltration and ultracentrifugation demonstrated that microsomalArg-1 prepared LC decreased iNOS-dependent NO \u0081 production. BEC and anti-Arg-1 antibody inhibited the NO\u0081 blocking ability of LC. Surprisingly, LC arginase activity requiredactivation by a cell-derived factor and its release could be blockedby treating cells with L-NIL. Increased consumption of the serum from endotoxemic activity was significantly increased. Furthermore, iNOSexisted in ileal mucosa predominantly in the inactive monomericform at 18 hours after lipopolysaccharide injection, consistent withdecreased iNOS activity in the absence of arginase.Conclusions Arg-1 is one such liver-derived protein that increases in serum during endotoxemia and other inflammatory states.Modulation of mucosal iNOS activity following activation ofcirculating Arg-1 may be protective because it would be expectedto decrease epithelial barrier dysfunction as a result of decreasedNO \u0081production.

The aim of the study was to evaluate theeffect of parenteral Gln supplementation on the outcome ofsurgical cancer patients after major surgery [1].Methods The study was performed on 40 adult patients admitted to the surgical ICU at the National Cancer Institute requiring totalparenteral nutrition (TPN) for at least 5 days. Patients wereassigned to two groups: control group, 20 patients receivednutritional support as the usual protocol; and Gln group, 20patients received nutritional support as the usual protocol +dipeptiven 300 mg/day for 7 days. Standard vitamins, traceelements, electrolytes and insulin therapy were supplied. The rateof infections, ICU and total hospital lengths of stay, severehyperglycemia and days of mechanical ventilation were recorded.Results There were no differences between groups according to the demographic data, metabolic and nutritional parameters andthe numbers of diabetic patients. There was also no difference inthe duration of TPN. The incidence of pneumonia, surgical woundinfection, sepsis, urinary or intravenous catheter infection weresignificantly lower in the Gln group compared with the controlgroup. The days of mechanical ventilation among ventilatedCritical Care March 2009 Vol 13 Suppl 1 29th International Symposium on Intensive Care and Emergency MedicineS57patients and the ICU length of stay were significantly lower in the Gln group compared with the control group. The nitrogen balancewas more negative in control patients than in Gln-supplementedpatients (the difference was insignificant). Hyperglycemia episodeswere significantly lower and easy controlled in the Gln group. Totalplasma amino acid concentrations and the Gln plasma levelincreased about 40% in patients receiving Gln supplementation.The number of adverse events per patient was significantly lower inthe Gln group (2.1 vs. 2.9, P<0.01). Conclusions Parenteral Gln-supplemented TPN reduces the clinical complications of surgical patients, mainly through a lowerincidence of pneumonia and better metabolic tolerance. This formsa strong rationale for the use of Gln-supplemented regimens forsurgical ICU patients.Reference1. and sys- temic infections in critically ill patients: effect glutamine.Crit Med 2005, 33:1125-1135. P137 Plasma citrulline kinetics and prognostic value in the critically ill patient G Piton1, B Cypriani1, E Monnet1, JC Multiple organ failure (MOF) is a frequent cause of death in the critically ill patient. The gut could be the cornerstone ofMOF, the first step being an early splanchnic ischemia, inducingthe loss of barrier function, systemic infections and MOF [1].Plasma citrulline (normal 20 to 60 mol/l) reflects a small bowel mass and is decreased in various small bowel diseases [2]. Theobjectives of the study were to study plasma citrulline kinetics andtheir prognostic value in adults hospitalized in the ICU.Methods A prospective monocentric observational study, including adults consecutively admitted to the ICU without smallbowel disease, and without chronic renal failure. We studied atonset, hour 12, hour 24, day 2, and day 7 of plasma citrulline, andclinical, biological, prognostic and therapeutic parameters. Theunivariate analysis of plasma citrulline (0 to 10 mol/l, 11 to 20mol/l, and >20 mol/l) with other variables and multivariate analysis.Results Sixty-seven patients were included, mean age 60 years, organ dysfunctions and/or infections model ODIN score of 2.4,IGS2 score (Simplified Acute Physiology Score) of 50, and a 28-day mortality of 34%. During the first day, mean plasma citrullinedecreased from 18.8 to 13.5 mol/l, and it decreased more in nonsurvivors than in survivors among patients without acute renalfailure (37% vs. 18%). A lower plasma citrulline at hour 24 wasassociated with higher plasma C-reactive protein, nosocomialinfection rate, and 28-day mortality ( P = 0.006, P = 0.03 and P = 0.03). A lower plasma citrulline at day 2 was associated with ahigher use of catecholamines, and a lower use of enteral feeding(P= 0.02 and P= 0.01). In multivariate analysis, plasma citrulline at hour 24 and ODIN score at admission 3 were associated with 28-day mortality ( P= 0.04 and P= 0.04). Conclusions A lower plasma citrulline at hour 24 was associated with higher plasma C-reactive protein, nosocomial infection rate,and 28-day mortality. A lower plasma citrulline at day 2 wasassociated with a higher use of catecholamines, and a lower use ofenteral feeding. Such results could reflect the systemic conse-quences of acute intestinal failure in patients hospitalized in the ICU.References 1. Deitch EA: Multiple organ failure.

P138 utilisation administration of a fish-oil-enriched new lipid formula (SMOFlipid\u00ae) in surgical ICU patients: comparison with a lipid emulsion based on olive and soybean oil S Piper1, T Sch\u00f6llhorn1, I Within the frame of postoperative total parenteral nutrition, a frequent consequence due to postaggression is an inhibition of lipoprotein lipase leading tohypertriglyceridemia [1]. The aim of this study was to investigatewhether the administration of a fish-oil-containing lipid emulsion(SMOF) compared with a lipid emulsion based on olive andsoybean oil led to a better utilisation of the lipids.Methods A prospective randomised study. After approval of the ethical committee, 44 postoperative surgical patients with anindication for parenteral nutrition therapy were included in thestudy. Nonprotein calories were given as 60% glucose and 40%lipid emulsion. The total energy intake per day was 25 kcal/kg bodyweight. The sedation regimen was standardised (midazolam andfentanyl), propofol lipid emulsion) group A ( n= (SMOFlipid group B ( n= 22) received an emulsion based on olive and soybean oil (ClinOleic20%). Lipid emulsions were administered for 5 days continuously. Trigylceride (TG) levelswere measured before the start of infusion (d0), at day 1 (d1), day 2(d2), and day 5 (d5) after the start of infusion. A pathological TGlevel was defined at 300 mg/dl and the significance level at P<0.05. Results There were no significant differences in TG levels at baseline (d0: group A: 119 \u00b1 35 vs. group B: 120 \u00b1 45 mg /dl;P= 0.87), whereas at d2 (group A: 151 \u00b1 52 vs. group B: 202 \u00b1 108 P< 0.03) and at P< 0.01) the TG levels in the SMOF group were significant lower than in the control group. At d5 the incidence ofpathological TG levels was significant lower in patients receivingSMOF (0%) compared with the control group (31.8%).Conclusions The administration of a fish-oil-containing lipid emulsion within a parenteral nutrition regimen led at d2 and d5 ofthe nutrition regimen to significantly reduced TG levels comparedwith a lipid emulsion based on olive and soybean oil, indicating abetter utilisation of the administered TGs.Reference1.

We hypothesized that gastric emptying and small bowel transit aredelayed.Methods We recruited eight trauma patients with intracranial hemorrhage (six male/two female, mean age 40 years, APACHE IIIscore 41 \u00b1 7, Glasgow coma scale 8 \u00b1 2) who were intubated,mechanically ventilated, sedated, and older than 18 years in thisprospective, controlled, Institution Review Board-approved trial.The historical control group consisted of 81 healthy volunteersstudied in a separate trial (Protocol #122205: Assessment ofwhole gut transit time using the SmartPill capsule: a multicenterstudy). A pH, pressure and temperature sensing capsule(SmartPill; SmartPill Inc., Buffalo, NY, USA) was positioned witha capsule delivery device (AdvanCE; US Endoscopy, Mentor,OH, USA) into the patient's stomach. The data were transmitted toa recorder attached to the patient's abdomen. The data wereanalyzed by two independent observers.Results There was a significant difference ( P = 0.004) in the gastric emptying time for ICU patients, 28.8 \u00b1 31.3 hours (mean \u00b1SD), and healthy volunteers, 3.3 \u00b1 1.1 hours. There was nosignificant difference between the small bowel transit times in ICUpatients, 7.1 \u00b1 3.6 hours, and 4.1 \u00b1 1.6 hours in healthy volun-teers. There was no difference in sedation and analgesia consump-tion between the ICU patients. None of the patients received anyproton pump inhibitor or prokinetic medication.Conclusions Gastric emptying is significantly delayed in major trauma patients; however, small bowel transit times are similar tothose in healthy volunteers. P140 Is intragastric administration of enteral nutrition safe in acute severe pancreatitis? I Grigoras, O Chelarescu, N Andrioaie, Enteral nutrition is the standard of nutritional support in acute severe pancreatitis. Nutrients are routinely delivered belowthe Treitz angle either by jejunostomy or by an endoscopicallyplaced nasojejunal tube. In recent years the safety of intragastricdelivery was under scrutiny [1]. Our study aimed to evaluate thecharacteristics of intragastric nutrition and its safety in acutesevere pancreatitis.Methods The retrospective study included all patients with acute severe pancreatitis (admission APACHE II score >12) admitted toan emergency university hospital during a 3-year period (2005 to2007). Nutritional support was assessed as type, route and timing.Collected data were age, admission and highest severity scores,intraabdominal pressure, antibiotic use, surgery, ICU and hospitallengths of stay, and outcome. The safety of intragastric nutritionwas assessed as the outcome.Results Forty-two patients were enrolled. Enteral nutrition was used in 25 patients (59.5%). The majority (20 patients, 80%)received at least for several days associated parenteral nutritionuntil the caloric needs could be met by the enteral route. Route ofadministration: intragastric, 16 patients (only oral intake, ninepatients; nasogastric tube, five patients; combined oral andjejunostomy, two patients) and only jejunostomy, nine patients. Nopatient had a nasojejunal tube. Intragastric nutrition started on the4.4th hospital day (mean value) (range 2 to 10 days). There wereno statistically significant differences between patients withintragastric versus jejunal nutrition concerning the demographics and severity scores on admission. The patients with intragastricnutrition compared with the jejunostomy group had a significantlylower rate of surgery (31.2% vs. 100%, P <0.01), antibiotic use (81.2% vs. 100%, P = 0.05) and lower mortality rate (25% vs. 55.5%, P = 0.01). Conclusions Despite the classical presumption that gastric nutrition may worsen the evolution of acute severe pancreatitis, ourstudy shows that intragastric administration does not increasemortality. Even more, compared with jejunostomy, it is associatedwith improved outcome, a lower rate of surgical interventions, andless antibiotic use.Reference1.

It is commonly used intravenously. The aim of our studywas to determine the effective lowest dose of enteral erythromycin,its tolerability and comparing the dose with the severity of thedisease and outcome.Methods All patients admitted to the trauma ICU between January 2004 and January 2008 who developed feeding intolerance wereincluded (residual volume >500/24 hours). The starting dose was125 mg erythromycin twice daily; if no response, the dose wasincreased up to a maximum of 1 g twice daily. Data were entered inSPSS software. The chi-square test + one-way ANOVA with post hocanalysis were used. P<0.05 was significant. Results One hundred and seven patients were included, with 85% being male, average age 41 \u00b1 18 years. The majority of patients(54%) suffered from traumatic brain injury, 74% were ventilated,51% Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score was significantlyhigher and the Glasgow coma scale was significantly lower inpatients receiving 1g erythromycin ( P<0.05). See Table 1. Conclusions A low dose of enteral erythromycin 125 mg twice daily is potentially effective in patients on intravenousmetoclopromide having enteral feeding intolerance. Combiningprokinetic therapy and keeping the administration of erythromycinas short as possible can prevent the development of bacterialresistance.Critical Care March 2009 Vol 13 Suppl 1 29th International Symposium on Intensive Care and Emergency Medicine Table 1 (abstract P141) Response rate and outcome related to enteral erythromycin dose Dosage Percentage Response (mg, of rate Average Outcome twice daily) patients (%) days (%) 125 45 100 4 71 250 37 97.5 9 55500 13 85.6 12 431,000 5 40 11 0S59P142 A randomised prospective trial to compare the efficacy of bolus versus continuous nasogastric feeding in paediatric intensive care P Kamath, J Longden, C Stack, A Mayer Sheffield Children's UKCritical Care 2009, 13(Suppl 1): Introduction Failure establish early nasogastric (NG) feeding is common in paediatric intensive care (PIC) influences theoutcome. Decreased gastrointestinal motility is multifactorial inorigin. NG hypothesise that bolus with NG feeds.We aimed to compare bolus versus continuous NG feeding in PIC.The outcome measures were the time to achieve maximalnutritional requirement by volume of feed and to identify thefrequency of adverse events.Methods Following ethical approval and informed consent, eligible admissions to a tertiary PIC from April 2006 to February 2008 wereprospectively randomised and enrolled into the study. Gastrostomyfeeding, use of motility drugs, gastroesophageal reflux andgastrointestinal surgery were the exclusion criteria. Patients wererandomised to receive either 3-hourly bolus feeds or continuousfeeding over 21 hours per day, for a 48-hour study period. NGtubes were aspirated 3-hourly and the gastric residual volume wasrecorded. The protocol was designed to give equal feed volume in a24-hour period. Intolerance was defined as gastric residual volumemore than 125% of feed administered. Data are expressed as themedian (interquartile range). Mann-Whitney's test and Fisher'sexact test were used to test for associations.Results Seventy-six patients were enrolled (1.2:1, male:female), median age 11.6 (2.8 to 49.0) months and weight 10 (4.5 to 16.2)kg. Bolus group subjects achieved maximal feed potential by21 hours (95% CI = 18.6 to 25), the continuous group required27 hours (95% CI = 19.5 to 30, P = 0.035). The demographic characteristics, sedation, muscle relaxant or inotrope usagebetween groups were comparable. There was no statisticallysignificant difference in the incidence of adverse events (bolusn= 3 and continuous n= 4, P = 0.71). Conclusions This is the first study comparing enteral feeding techniques in PIC patients. In PIC, bolus feeding methods may bemore beneficial, in achieving maximal nutritional requirementsearlier, when compared with continuous feeds. The risk of aspirationof aspiration or vomiting is low with both feeding techniques. P143 Nutrition therapy in the critical care setting: what is best achievable practice? An international quality improvement project NE Jones, R Dhaliwal, X Jiang, DK Heyland Queen's University, 2009, 13(Suppl 1): P143 (doi: 10.1186/cc7307) Introduction The purpose of this study was to describe current nutrition practices in ICUs and to determine the best achievablepractice relative to the Critical Care Nutrition Clinical PracticeGuidelines (CPGs).Methods We conducted an international, prospective, obser- vational, cohort study. In January 2007, each ICU recorded data onnutrition practices on a consecutive cohort of 20 mechanicallyventilated adult patients that stayed in the ICU for at least72 hours. Data were collected from the time of admission to theICU to ICU discharge, or for a maximum of 12 days. Relative to the CPGs, we report average, best, and worst site performance on keynutrition practices.Results A total of 158 ICUs from 20 countries participated, and each enrolled an average of 18.6 patients for a total of 2,946patients. Adherence to CPG recommendations was high for somerecommendations; namely, use of enteral nutrition (EN) inpreference to parenteral nutrition (PN) (site average 61.7% (range1 to 97.3%) of patients received EN alone), glycemic control (siteaverage 7.5 (range 3.5 to 10.4) mmol/l), lack of utilization ofarginine-enriched enteral formulas (site average 3.5% (range 0 to92.3%) of patients on EN), delivery of hypocaloric PN (site average16.8 (range 2.7 to 35.5) kcal/kg), and the presence of a feedingprotocol (79.7% of ICUs). However, significant practice gaps wereidentified for other recommendations. The average time to start ofEN was 46.5 hours (range 8.2 to 149.1 hours). The average use ofmotility agents and small bowel feeding in patients with highgastric residual volumes was 58.7% (range 0 to 100%) and14.7% (range 0 to 100%), respectively. There was poor compli-ance with recommendations for the use of enteral formulasenriched with fish oils, glutamine supplementation, timing ofsupplemental PN, avoidance of soy-bean-oil-based parenterallipids. Average nutritional adequacy was 59% (range 20.5 to94.7%) for energy and 60.3% (range 18.6 to 153.5%) for protein.Conclusions Large gaps exist between the evidence-based recommendations and actual practice in ICUs, and consequentlynutrition therapy is suboptimal. We have identified best achievablepractice that can serve as targets for future quality improvementinitiatives. P144 Feeding enterally the hemodynamically unstable critically ill patient: experience from a multicentre trial (the REDOXS\u00a9study) R Dhaliwal, J Drover, J Muscedere, X Jiang, DK 2009, 13(Suppl (doi: 10.1186/cc7308) Introduction The delivery of adequate enteral nutrition (EN) in critically ill patients with shock is problematic. The purpose of thisstudy is to describe how EN is delivered in patients with shockfrom the REDOXS \u00a9study, a multicentre, randomized controlled trial of pharmaconutrition.Methods In 20 centres in Canada and Europe, we randomized mechanically ventilated adults with two or more organ failures toone of four groups: (1) glutamine, (2) antioxidants, (3) glutamineplus antioxidants, (4) placebo. EN and parenteral nutrition wereinitiated and maintained independently as per the CanadianClinical Practice Guidelines. Shock was defined as the presenceof hypoperfusion requiring vasopressors for at least 2 hours. Dailydata including the timing of EN, volumes received, incidence ofhigh gastric residual volumes (hGRVs), use and timing of motilityagents and small bowel feeding were collected.Results From May 2007 to July 2008, 159 patients with shock were randomized, 122 (77%) received EN only, and 13 (8%)patients received EN in combination with parenteral nutrition. ENwas started 20.2 hours (median, range 0 to 204.8 hours) after ICUadmission. The mean duration of EN was 9.2 days (median 6.8,range 0.1 to 30 days) and the mean volume of EN received was67% (range 2.5 to 199%) of that prescribed. In total 73/135(55%) had hGRVs >250 ml, and in these patients motility agentsand small bowel feeding were used in 78.1% and 41.1% ofpatients, respectively. Motility agents were started before onset ofhGRVs in 21% patients, on the same day as hGRVs in 40%Available online http://ccforum.com/supplements/13/S1S60patients and on average 1.6 \u00b1 0.9 days after hGRVs in 39% patients. The percentage mean prescribed volume of EN received24 hours before and after the start of motility agents was 35.1%vs. 55.9% ( P = 0.009). Small bowel feeding was started before onset of hGRVs in 20% patients, on the same day as hGRVs in14% patients and was started on average 4.7 \u00b1 3.5 (mean, SD)days after hGRVs in 67% patients. The percentage meanprescribed volume of EN received 24 hours before and after thestart of small bowel feeding was 54.2% vs. 67.3% ( P = 0.36). Conclusions In critically ill patients with shock, EN can be provided in the early phases of acute illness to the majority ofpatients. The delivery of EN in this population can be maximized bybetter adoption of motility agents and small bowel feeding. P145 Molecular adsorbent recirculating system: a clinical experience in acute or acute on chronic liver failure (133 sessions) I Cardeau, L Lavayssiere, MB Nogier, O Industry, Rostock, Germany) is an extracorporealacute liver failure support system method using albumin-enricheddialysate to remove albumin-bound toxins.Methods Between 2004 and 2007, we performed 133 MARS treatments in 46 patients: Sequential Organ Failure Assessmentscore 11.8 \u00b1 4.5. Indication for MARS included 16 cases of fulmi-nant hepatic failure, 21 cases of acute failure on cirrhosis, oneintractable pruritus, eight moderate or severe acute liver failure(Bernuau criteria). Among all these patients, 16 had acute renal failure (hepatorenal syndrome). It was a retrospective study. All datawere recorded before (T0) and at the end of MARS treatment (T).Results Among 16 fulminant hepatic failure patients, we observed a significant decrease of encephalopathy ( P = 0.04). On the other hand we did not observe significant improvement of hemodynamicparameters (norepinephrine dose, mean arterial pressure), aminotransferase, -glutamyltransferase, prothrombin time, factor V). In this subgroup, hospital mortality is31% at day 28. In the group treated for acute on chronic liverfailure, the results did not show a difference between grade ofencephalopathy before and after the session. We only observed atrend of improvement in hemodynamic and biologic parameters butthis was not statistically significant except for cholestaseparameters ( -glutamyltransferase P = 0.022, bilirubin P = 0.002). Hospital mortality is 71% at day 28. Among the patients withhepatorenal syndrome, 62.5% were anuric. We observed asignificant increase of diuresis output ( P <0.01). We did not observe any significant adverse event.Conclusions Our results confirmed that nonbiologic hepatic support by MARS was safe. The results were disappointing aboveall in cirrhosis patients. Nevertheless, results in hepatorenal syn-drome were encouraging. P146 Comparison of two indwelling bowel catheters on economic impact by number of bedding and dressing changes per day Bowel Management Research Group, EC Konz Hollister Incorporated, Libertyville, IL, (doi: prevalent in patients in the acute/ICU setting [1,2]. The primary objective of this study was toassess and compare the economic impact on fecal containmentwith use of catheter A or catheter B at 12 sites (A, seven sites; B,five sites) in the acute/ICU setting. Catheter A is Zassi BowelManagement System (Hollister Inc.) and catheter B is Flexi-SealFecal Management System (ConvaTec, Inc.).Methods An analysis of 146 patients (A, 76 patients; B, 70 patients) on the number of bedding and dressing change visits perpatient-day (frequency of nursing visits per day spent changingbedding/dressings due to fecal contamination) can be used as anindirect economic measure of catheter leakage and containment.Routine daily bedding/dressing changes were not included, onlycatheter-related bedding/dressing changes were recorded.Results A nearly 30% reduction (1.20 vs. 1.71) in the rate of bedding/dressing changes per patient-day were observed forcatheter A compared with catheter B ( P = 0.0035). For catheter A sites, 735 bedding/dressing change visits occurred over 612patient-days; and for catheter B sites, 705 bedding/dressingchange visits occurred over 413 patient-days. Although non-significant, lower observed rates of leakage (A, 1.1; B, 1.4), reposi-tions due to leakage (A, 0.25; B, 0.39), and devices expelled (A,0.02; B, 0.07) may have contributed to the significant reduction inbedding/dressing changes associated with the use of catheter Acompared with catheter B.Conclusions The use of indwelling bowel management systems to divert, collect, and contain liquid stools may provide an economicadvantage in an acute/ICU setting for patients with fecalincontinence. These results suggest that catheter A may have agreater economic value compared with catheter B by decreasingthe number of nursing visits per of incontinence and associ- ated skin injury the acute care patient.

P148 Hungarian perioperative selenium Leiner1, Mikor1, A (doi: 10.1186/cc7312) Introduction Selenium is one of the most investigated trace elements and an important link in the antioxidant system [1]. It isknown that selenium levels are lower than normal at the time ofadmittance to the ICU in critically ill patients [2]. Several cohortsurveys highlight the role of selenium deficiency in the carcino-genesis of oesophageal cancer [3]. Mortality and morbidity dataafter oesophagectomy may vary, but remain considerably high [4].Methods In three Hungarian university centres, 36 patients who were operated on with oesophageal cancer (OG-group) andadmitted to the ICU, and 96 healthy volunteers (C-group) wererecruited. In the OG-group, full blood selenium levels weremeasured (t0) and on the first (t1) and second (t2)postoperative days. Selenium levels were measured by atomicabsorption spectrometry in the laboratories of Byosin ArzneimittelGmbH (Fellbach, Germany), blinded to patient's condition or groupassignment. All data are presented as the mean \u00b1 SD. To test thenormal distribution the Kolgomorov-Smirnov test was used. Forstatistical analysis the independent-samples ttest and ANOVA were used as appropriate. For statistical analysis the StatisticalProgram for Social Sciences (SPSS \u00aeversion 15.0) software for Windows was used. Statistical significance was considered at P <0.05.Results There was a significant difference in the full blood selenium levels between the controls and preoperative shown significantly lower selenium levels in OG-patients as compared with controls and a significantdecrease in the postoperative period.

P149 Selenium in critically ill children with cardiac dysfunction M Abd Elmonim, TA Abd Elgawd, A Abd Elkareem, T ZidanAin 10.1186/cc7313) Introduction Selenium (Se) and for the activity of glutathione peroxidase enzyme (GPX).GPX plays an important role in antioxidant defense. Se deficiencyis reported in critically ill patients due to deficient dietetic intake,unsupplemented parenteral nutrition, catabolic state and increasedlosses. The objective of the study was to study the Se and GPXstatus in critically ill children with cardiac dysfunction and theeffects of Se supplementation.Methods Thirty-five critically ill cardiac children (mean age: 2.82 \u00b1 3.41 years) with different cardiac disorders (15 with myocarditis,15 with cardiomyopathy and five with rheumatic heart disease)were investigated for blood Se and GPX levels andechocardiographic parameters at admission and after 3 days ofparenteral Se supplementation (initial dose of 2 g/kg/day on the first day followed by 1 g/kg/day). Fifteen healthy children were included as controls.Results At admission, Se and GPX levels were significantly decreased in patients (6.61 \u00b1 1.16 g/l and 10.8 \u00b1 1.14 not differ between studied cardiac diseases ( P>0.05). Se levels correlated positively with corresponding ejection fraction values (EF) ( r= 0.57 and P<0.05) and fractional shortening values (FS) ( r= 0.45 and P <0.05), and negatively with end-diastolic diameter ( r= and P 2.25 g/l 19.71 \u00b1 U/l). Clinical examination revealed that orthopnea improved in 88.6% of cases and dys-rhythmia disappeared in 65.7%. Echocardiography showed that EFand FS were also significantly improved (admission values for EFand FS were 34.6 \u00b1 7.4 and 16.8 \u00b1 4.1, compared with 52.6 \u00b111.4 and 27.7 \u00b1 6.8 after Se supplementation; P <0.05). Conclusions Se deficiency is one of the mechanisms of worsening cardiac dysfunction in critically ill patients regardless of theunderlying cardiac etiology. Se supplementation can reverse sucha mechanism and improve cardiac performance.Available online http://ccforum.com/supplements/13/S1 Table 1 (abstract P147) NK cells and CD4-lymphocyte apoptosis Acute Healthy Median (%) P + 56)+/CD3- 15.09 6.50 0.036 ANNEXIN+/CD4+ 7.16 4.63 NS Table 2 (abstract P147) Alterations over follow-up Day 1 Day 4 substitution on selected laboratory parameters and prognosis in critically ill patients H Brodska, A Kazda, J Valenta, J Hendl University 2009, 1): P150 (doi: 10.1186/cc7314) Introduction High doses of selenium (Se) may improve the condition of ICU patients with respect to its involvement inantioxidative protection and other tasks. In the previous work weconcluded, that the decrease of 28-day mortality is not significant.Now procalcitonin (PCT), C-reactive protein (CRP) and SequentialOrgan Failure Assessment (SOFA), as markers of the severity ofactual status, were monitored and evaluated in relation to theplasma Se concentration.Methods One hundred and forty patients were randomized into groups A and B. Group A received standard Se substitution: 30 to75 g/day NaSelenite intravenously; group B received Se substitution according to a protocol: 1,000 g at day 1, followed with 500 g at days 2 to 14. These groups were divided into four subgroups: systemic inflammatory response syndrome, sepsis,severe sepsis and septic shock. Plasma levels of Se, CRP andPCT were examined. SOFA and 28-day mortality were evaluatedas clinical markers. Relations between parameters were evaluatedstatistically. In both groups, transitions among subgroups duringtreatment were evaluated. All patients monitored less than threetimes were excluded.Results Negative correlations between Se x PCT, Se x SOFA and Se x CRP were found (Table 1). Correlation coefficients ( r) were statistically significantly higher in group B. Evaluation of transitionsamong subgroups during treatment showed there was a differencein subgroup septic shock between groups A and B. Into the lesssevere stage of sepsis moved 28% in group A (14 examinations)and 44% (16 examinations) in group B. Table 1 (abstract P150) Negative correlations Parameter Group A Group -0.03 NS Conclusions There were more significant negative correlations between plasmatic Se and parameters of inflammation in the groupof patients supplemented with high doses of Se. In accordancewas a finding of more frequent transition from septic shock to aless severe stage of sepsis. Even if a decrease of mortality wasagain not found, the presented results may perhaps indicate apositive metabolic influence in critical illness. P151 Dynamic generation of physiological model systems J Kretschmer1, P151 (doi: 10.1186/cc7315) Introduction Mathematical models are widely used to simulate physiological processes in the human body and can be exploitedfor diagnostic purpose or the automation of therapeutic measures[1]. Usually these models focus on one single aspect of the human physiology. Complex models with interaction between differentphysiological processes usually do not consist of interchangeablesubmodels. We therefore designed a versatile software based onMatlab with dynamically exchangeable subsystems within the threemodel families of respiratory mechanics, gas exchange andcardiovascular dynamics.Methods For each submodel the parameters have been extracted from the corresponding literature. Common interfaces were defined for each model family based on these parameters to ensureinterchangeability within the same model family. For simulation ofhuman body gas exchange we used a two-compartment modelwith oxygen and carbon dioxide dissociation curves. The modelfamily of cardiovascular dynamics consisted of a single-compartment model and a six-compartment model including theresponse to pleural pressure. The respiratory mechanics werebased on a first-order resistance-compliance model and a second-order resistance-compliance model. Model parameters were fit tohuman test data or to data taken from the literature. Simulation isexecuted using a dedicated caller program to combine theselected submodels and to execute them subsequently at eachtime step. Submodel selection and basic parameter specificationcan be done via a graphical user interface. The software wastested with different model combinations. Each combination wassupplied with alterations in ventilation frequency and positive end-expiratory pressure.Results Simulation based on parameters from the literature with the variations described above showed plausible results. Altera-tions in ventilation frequency indicated a response time consistentwith data acquired by Jensen and colleagues [2].Conclusions The developed software is able to simulate different combinations of submodels at variable complexity. Simulationresults are consistent with experimental data. Interaction betweensubmodels can be seen in the simulation output.References1.

CI correspondingly 1.9 \u00b1 l/minute/m and ( <0.0001), CPI hemodynamic indices (CO, CI, SV, SI, CP and CPI)were statistically significantly lower ( P <0.05) in comparison with the data of patients receiving less than 10 g/kg/minute, while PCWP and CVP values differed insignificantly. Inhospital mortalitywas higher among patients receiving 10 g/kg/minute dopamine or more. Among 31 patients receiving less than 10 g/kg/minute dopamine 16 (51.6%) died, while among those 31 receiving10g/kg/minute or more 27 (87.1%) died. This was a significant difference according to the Pearson 2criterion ( 2= 9.182, P= 0.002). Conclusions Initiation of aortic counterpulsation should be considered as soon as possible, while the patient with acutemyocardial infarction is treated with low doses of vasopressors. P153 Study of risk factors for female patients with acute myocardial infarction H Fu1, Y Zhao2 1China Rehabilitation Research Center, Beijing, China; 2Gerontic ChinaCritical (doi: 10.1186/cc7317) Introduction Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is one of the most common cardiovascular emergencies. Female patients havedifferent features to male patients. The objective of our study wasto analyze risk factors for female patients with AMI.Methods Five hundred and eighty female patients were compared with 2,058 male patients for age, occupation, positive familyhistory, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and hyperlipemia.Then, according to age, patients with AMI were divided into fourgroups: <55 years, 55 to 64 years, 65 to 74 years, 75 years. Risk factors were compared between female patients and male patientsin each group.Results Compared with male patients, female patients were older (P<0.01); The morbidity of type 2 diabetes mellitus and hyper- tension and the rate of physical labors were significantly higher infemale patients ( P<0.01, P<0.01, P<0.01); the morbidity of hyperlipemia and the rate of mental labors and positive familyhistory were significantly lower in female patients ( P<0.01, P<0.01, P<0.05). In the <55 years group, the morbidity of type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension and the rate of physical laborswere significantly higher in female patients ( P<0.05, P<0.01, P<0.01); the rate of mental labors were significantly lower in female patients ( P<0.01). In the 55 to 64 years group, the morbidity of type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension and the rateof physical labors were significantly higher in female patients(P<0.01, P<0.05, P<0.01); the rate of mental labors was signifi- cantly lower in female patients ( P<0.01). In the 65 to 74 years group, the morbidity of type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertensionand the rate of physical labors were significantly higher in femalepatients ( P<0.05, P<0.01, P<0.01); the rate of mental laborswas significantly lower in female patients ( P<0.01). In the 75 years group, the rate of physical labors was significantly higher in female patients ( P<0.01); the rate of mental labors was significantly lower in female patients ( P<0.01). Conclusions Compared with male patients, female patients with AMI were older, and type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertensionprobably played more important roles in female patients. A higherrate of physical labors and a lower rate of mental labors in femalepatients probably contribute to prevent them from AMI.

Norepinephrine was titrated to MAPs of 65 mmHg, 75 mmHg and 85 mmHg in 20 patients with septicshock.Results At each level of MAP, hemodynamic parameters (heart rate, PAOP, cardiac index, left ventricular stroke work index, andsystemic vascular resistance index), metabolic parameters (oxygendelivery, oxygen consumption, blood lactate), and regionalperfusion parameters (gastric mucosal PCO 2, skin capillary blood flow and red blood cell velocity, urine output) were measured.Increasing the MAP from 65 to 85 mmHg with norepinephrineresulted in increases in cardiac index from 3.5 \u00b1 0.4 l/min/m 2to 5.0 \u00b1 0.5 l/min/m2(P< 0.03). Blood lactate was 3.5 \u00b1 0.8 mEq/l at a MAP of 65 mmHg and 3.0 \u00b1 0.8 mEq/l at 85 mmHg ( P = NS). gradient arterial PCO2was 11 \u00b1 3 mmHg 0.3 kPa) at a MAP of 65 mmHg and 15 \u00b1 3 mmHg at 85 mmHg (2.0 \u00b1 0.3 kPa, P = NS). Urine output at 65 mmHg was 40 \u00b1 10 ml/hour and was 45 \u00b1 12 ml/hourat 85 mmHg ( P = NS). As the MAP was raised, there were no significant changes in skin capillary blood flow or red blood cellvelocity.Conclusions Increasing the MAP from 65 mmHg to 85 mmHg with norepinephrine does not significantly affect systemic oxygenmetabolism, skin microcirculatory blood flow, urine output, orsplanchnic perfusion. P155 Echocardiographic assessment of the effects of acute left ventricular pacing on patients with severe congestive heart failure and narrow QRS duration K Hussein, H Elaassar, D Ragab, H Elattroush, R Soliman, (doi: 10.1186/cc7319) Introduction More than 20% of patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) exhibit one form or another of mechanicaldyssynchrony, intraventricular conduction impairment, or bundlebranch block. The concept of dual-chamber pacing in refractoryheart failure was introduced to be followed later by the techniqueof biventricular pacing to restore cardiac synchrony in the failingAvailable online http://ccforum.com/supplements/13/S1S64heart. The aim of the present study was to address the issue of applying the technique of left ventricular (LV) pacing to thatsubstrate of heart failure patients with a narrow rather than wideQRS complex, and with LV rather than biventricular pacing in orderto permit the use of an ordinary dual-chamber pacemaker.Methods We conducted an acute study on 20 patients (15 male, five female; mean age 43 years); all had CHF (12 ischemic andeight idiopathic) with normal QRS duration on ECG. All patientswere under maximal tolerated doses of antifailure treatment. Allpatients area and cardiac outputbefore and 15 minutes after LV pacing. All patients were subjectedto temporary dual-chamber right atrium, pacing; the the transaortic route. The pulmonarycapillary pressure (PCWP) was measured using a trilumen,balloon-tipped thermodilution catheter. Patients weredivided into group II(PCWP <15 mmHg, 10 patients).Results Echocardiographic measurements after pacing in group I showed significantly lower LVEDD (5.12 vs. 6.53 cm, P <0.004), lower LVESD (4.01 vs. 4.65 cm, P <0.034), smaller mitral regurge area (9.7 vs. 13.4 cm 2, P<0.005), higher FS (18.9 vs. 17, P<0.04) and higher EF (37.9 vs. 35.5%, P<0.02). In contrast, following pacing in group II, the hemodynamics were notsignificantly different from pre-pacing values.Conclusions Single LV - rather than biventricular - pacing could achieve remarkable hemodynamic beneficial effects in patients withCHF even with normal QRS, but only in that substrate of patientswith a high PCWP. Although this is an acute study, our findingsopen the scope for widespread application of the concept ofmultisite pacing. P156 Left ventricular pacing alone improves haemodynamic variables D Rgab EgyptCritical Care 2009, 13(Suppl 1): P156 (doi: 10.1186/cc7320) Introduction Despite advances in drug treatment, congestive heart failure (CHF) remains a major healthcare problem associated witha poor quality of life and a high mortality rate. During the pastdecade, cardiac resynchronisation therapy (CRT) using biventri-cular (BIV) pacing emerged as a promising technique improvingthe quality of life, exercise tolerance and mortality in patients withsevere CHF. Left univentricular (LV) pacing is able to achieve thesame mechanical synchronisation as BIV pacing in experimentalstudies and in humans resulting in significant improvement infunctional class, quality of life and exercise tolerance at the sameextent as those observed with BIV stimulation. The aim was tostudy the acute hemodynamic effects of LV pacing in the categoryof patients with severe CHF and QRS duration <130 ms and todetermine whether pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP)>15 mmHg could have an impact on these changes in hemo-dynamics.Methods We conducted an acute study on 20 patients (15 male, five female; mean age 43 years); all had CHF (12 ischemic andeight idiopathic) with a duration <130 ms. All patients had anejection fraction <40%. Group I comprised 10 patients withPCWP >15 mmHg, group II comprised 10 patients with PCWP<15 mmHg. Haemodynamics were measured using a Swan-Ganzcatheter at baseline and during LV VDD pacing. All patients were under maximal tolerated doses of antifailure treatment.Results After LV pacing, group I showed a significant decrease in right atrial pressure ( P= 0.001), and PCWP also the cardiac output ignificantly increased ( P= 0.04). In group II none of these hemodynamic parameters showed any significant improvement. The improvementof hemodynamics in group I occurred despite the greater increasein QRS duration after LV pacing when compared with group II (24vs. 21%, respectively).Conclusions pacing acutely benefits >15 mmHg irrespective of the QRS duration. Although this is anacute study, our findings open the scope for revising the currentwide QRS duration as an indication for CRT and to consider theless expensive LV rather than BIV pacing when a patient isconsidered a candidate for resynchronization. P157 Preoperative left atrial dysfunction and new-onset atrial fibrillation cardiac surgery patients M Brouard, JJ Jimenez, J Iribarren, L Lorente, R Perez, L Lorenzo, S Palmero, L Raja, N Perez, R Martinez, ML MoraHospital Universitario atrial fibrillation is one of the most frequent complications after cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Theaim of the present study was to investigate the correlation betweenpreoperative left atrial dysfunction assessed by tissue performed on elective cardiac surgery patients. Left atrialfunction was evaluated with tissue Doppler imaging of the mitralannulus.Results We studied 92 patients, 73 (79%) males and 19 (21%) females, mean age 67 \u00b1 10 years, in preoperative sinus rhythmwho underwent elective CABG under at 34 12 postoperativehours. Patients with NOAF were older (71 \u00b1 7 vs. 66 \u00b1 10 years,P= 0.034), had a larger left lower peak atrial systolic mitral annular Doppler velocity (A m) and higher /Aratio in a bivariate analysis. Stepwise logistic regression analysisshowed that LAD (OR = 2.23, 95% CI = 1.05 to 4.76; P= 0.033) and lower A m (OR = 0.70, 95% CI = 0.55 to 0.99; P= 0.034) with postoperative A preoperative left atrial dysfunction assessed by tissue Doppler imaging may identify the patients at risk of post-operative NOAF. P158 Right ventricular (TS) is by a transient apical ballooning of the left ventricle, reversible ST-T-segment abnormalities mimicking myocardial infarction disturbance of the left ventricle, recentlyCritical Care March 2009 Vol 13 Suppl 1 29th International Symposium on Intensive Care and Emergency MedicineS65an involvement of the apex of the right ventricle (RV) has been recognized affecting approximately one-quarter of cases.Methods TS was diagnosed in 10 patients (nine female, one male; mean age 67 years) who displayed typical signs of acutemyocardial ischemia, showed typical ECG changes and slightlyelevated n\u00b1 3.5 ng/ml; normal <0.3 Echocardiography was obtained on admission in all patients. TSwas presumed by identification of the typical LV apical ballooningconfiguration (echo positive). In 10 patients left heart catheteri-zation was then performed immediately.Results All patients displayed LV apical ballooning on LV angio- graphy without coronary artery Nine patients were echopositive (90%; sensitivity 91%, specificity 100%); in the one echo-negative patient the LV angiogram showed only a very small apicalballooning area. In all of the nine patients classified as echopositive, involvement of the RV apex was identified as well.Additional hypokinesia of the middle part of the RV was seen intwo patients; however, the basal RV wall segments were nevercompromised. One patient showed dynamic LV outflow tractobstruction.Conclusions RV involvement was a common feature in TS, involving 90% of patients. In all cases, the apical portion of the RVwas compromised, the basal segments were never affected. Inmost patients the typical wall motion disturbance was readily seenon transthoracic echocardiogram. RV involvement was identified inall echo-positive patients. Probably, identification of RV apicalballooning may aid in differentiating TS from MI. P159 Possible cause of bradycardia developed due to 2-sympothomimetic infusion K Popugaev, I Savin, A Goriachev, Introduction Bradycardia is described as a side effect of 2- sympothomimetic infusion. It is supposed as a dose-dependentphenomenon. Cholinergic antagonists or -sympathomimetics are recommended for the bradycardia correction. We propose that theseverity of bradycardia associated with 2-sympothomimetic infusion depends on the level of hypothyroidism. The aim of thisreport is to provide evidence for our point of view.Methods Fifteen patients after sellar region tumor surgery were included in the study. Resistant arterial hypotension developed inthe early postoperative period in all patients and they weremonitored with a Swan-Ganz catheter for this reason. Thehormonal profile (triiodothyronine, thyroxine, free triiodothyronine,free thyroxine, and daily during the wholeperiod of hemodynamic monitoring.Results The cause of resistant arterial hypotension in all cases was decreased vascular tone (systemic vascular resistance index =1,503 \u00b1 6 24 dyn\u00b7s\u00b7cm 5\u00b7m2), and so phenylephrine as the 2- sympothomimetic was the drug of choice. Administration ofphenylephrine started with the mean dose of 2.9 g/kg/minute, and the maximal mean dose during the period of arterialhypotension was 5 g/kg/minute. Bradycardia developed in four patients during infusion of phenylephrine. All these patients hadclinical signs of hypothyroidism (hypothermia, etc.)and and T4. In cholinergic antagonists and -sympathomimetics. Simul- taneously, dose administration of thyroid hormones was increased.Heart rates reached the normal range, when clinical signs of hypothyroidism were corrected, and the level of thyroid hormonestended to rise. In 11 patients without clinical signs of hypo-thyroidism and normal levels of thyroid hormones in plasma,bradycardia never developed even if they received high doses ofphenylephrine (5.5 g/kg/min). Conclusions Bradycardia, associated with 2-sympothomimetic infusion, is a consequence of hypothyroidism in patients after sellarregion tumor surgery. This phenomenon is not dose dependent.Patients with bradycardia, developed after beginning 2-sympotho- mimetic infusion, need to be screened for hypothyroidism. Ifhypothyroidism is confirmed, therapy with L-thyroxin should be administrated immediately. In patients having received thyroidhormones, their doses need to be increased. P160 Automatic real-time detection of myocardial ischemia with high sensitivity [1]. In this combinedexperimental and clinical study using an epicardial accelerometer,we aimed to test two methods for real-time automated detection ofmyocardial ischemia.Methods One accelerometer (5 x 5 x 2 mm 3) was sutured in the perfusion area of the left anterior descending artery (LAD).Epicardial acceleration was simultaneously recorded with ECG,and the ECG QRS complex was automatically detected for timingof systole. From the epicardial acceleration, signal circumferentialpeak velocity and displacement was automatically calculated withina time interval of 150 ms after peak R on the ECG. Experimentalmodel: in 10 open-chest pigs, regional left ventricular function wasreduced by temporary LAD occlusion and global myocardialfunction changed by esmolol infusion. The myocardial circum-ferential strain measured by echocardiography was used to confirmischemia. Clinical model: the accelerometer methods were testedin seven patients, receiving coronary artery bypass grafting. LADwas occluded for 3 minutes before grafting and the accelerometermeasurements were compared for hemodynamics, ECG ST-segment analysis and strain by transoesophageal echocardio-graphy.Results Accelerometer systolic displacement was superior to systolic velocity detect ischemia by automated analysis.Accelerometer systolic displacement demonstrated dyskinesiaduring LAD occlusion pigs 2.3 to -1.2 \u00b1 2.8 mm,P<0.01), while hypokinesia was found in patients (12.8 \u00b1 8.1 to 3.5 \u00b1 4.4 mm, P <0.01). Ischemia was confirmed by strain echo- cardiography in both models ( P <0.01). No significant changes in hemodynamics and in the ECG ST segment were seen during LADocclusion in patients. In the experimental model, esmolol infusioninduced fewer changes in the automated accelerometermeasurements than LAD occlusion ( P < 0.01) and ischemia was detected with a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 95 to 100%.Conclusions Sensitive real-time detection of myocardial ischemia was feasible by the use of automated analysis of continuousepicardial accelerometer signals. This technique may improve real-time detection of ischemia during and after cardiac surgery.Reference1.

Cardiac power (CP) (a parameter proportional to the product of CO and mean arterial pressure) was introduced after studies mainly performed using the invasive intermittent thermodilution (ITD) technique. The aim of this study was to investigate the reliability and specificity of the new parameter mainly by means of noninvasive techniques such as impedance cardiography (ICG). Methods CO and CP were evaluated by both ITD and ICG methods in patients with AMI, admitted within 12 hours from the onset of pain. CP was evaluated using the suggested formula: CP = CO x MAP / 451, where MAP = mean arterial pressure. During the period of 2004 to 2008, 289 (196 men and 93 women) patients were investigated. The standard eight-electrode ICG registration was used. The optimal binning method using the minimal description length principle was used to predict outcomes after AMI: inhospital mortality, survival after 6 months and survival after 12 months. Results CP evaluated on the first day was found as the only valuable prognostic parameter using the model entropy method in the group of patients where noninvasive evaluation of CO was used. Inhospital mortality was predicted with single cut point 0.65, sensitivity 100% and specificity 92.2%, while survival of 12 months was predicted with single cut point 0.90, sensitivity 88.9% and specificity 73.0%. Only prediction of inhospital mortality was possible in the group of patients where CO was evaluated using the ITD technique. The most significant criteria using minimized entropy model were CP evaluated on the third day (single cut point 0.79, sensitivity 84.6%, specificity 100.0%) and CO evaluated also on the third day (single cut point 4.00, sensitivity 84.6%, specificity 100.0%). Conclusions Cardiac power is a reliable predictor for inhospital mortality and survival within the first year after acute myocardial infarction. It could be evaluated using ITD and with sufficient accuracy by means of a noninvasive method - ICG - as well. P162 Left ventricular torsion analysis using echocardiographic speckle tracking in a canine model of dyssynchrony and cardiac resynchronization therapy predicts global cardiac performance B Lamia, M Tanabe, HK Kim, J Gorcsan, MR Pinsky University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Pittsburgh, PA, USA Critical Care 2009, 13(Suppl 1): P162 (doi: 10.1186/cc7326) Introduction Left ventricular (LV) torsion a primary mechanism used to eject blood during systole. We hypothesized that LV torsion is impaired during dyssynchronous contractions and restored with cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) in proportion to the degree that global LV performance improves. Methods Seven anesthetized open-chest dogs had high fidelity pressure and conductance volume catheters to assess LVperformance. Basal and apical Grayscale echo images were recorded. Right atrial (RA) pacing served as the control. Right ventricular (RV) outflow tract pacing created a left bundle branch block (LBBB) to simulate dyssynchrony. Simultaneous RV-LV free wall and pacing were modeled CRT (CRTfw and CRTa). Torsion was estimated as the difference between apical and basal rotation in degrees. Results Torsion during RA pacing was 7.0 \u00b1 3.6\u00b0. RV pacing decreased torsion (5.1 \u00b1 3.6\u00b0, P <0.05 vs. control), reduced the stroke volume (SV), stroke work (SW), and d P/dtmaxcompared with RA (21 \u00b1 5 vs. 17 \u00b1 5 ml, 252 with RV pacing (7.7 \u00b1 4.7\u00b0, 23 \u00b1 3 1,699 \u00b1 432 mmHg/s, respectively, P<0.05) (Figure 1). Changes in torsion compared with RA covaried with changes in SW during RV, CRTa and CRTfw. Conclusions LV torsion, as quantified by speckle tracking echocardiography in an acute canine model, was reduced by dyssynchrony contraction and restored by CRT in proportion to the degree to which global measures of LV performance also improved. Thus, torsion and global LV performance are linked during synchronous, dyssynchronous contractions and CRT. P163 Cardiac diseases during pregnancy and periperium: 13 years in the ICU K Baccar, N Baffoun, C Kaddour National Institute 13(Suppl P163 (doi: 10.1186/cc7327) Introduction Pregnancy, labour and the postpartum period constitute major stresses on the cardiovascular system. Patients with heart disease may decompensate due to the physiologic changes that occur during pregnancy and may develop a cardiac event with obstetric events. Methods A retrospective collection of data for all obstetric patients admitted to our ICU in a 13-year period (September 1995 to September 2008). Data collected include the antepartum or peripartum heart status (abnormal finding on physical examination, ECG and echocardiography), reason for admission, stay on the ICU prognostic scoring (APACHE II, Obstetrical SAPS) and the outcome. Results During 13 years there were 42 obstetric admissions to our ICU. The reason for admission was due to pulmonary edema 16 (38.1%) cases, hemorrhagic shock 11 (26.2%) cases, cardiogenic shock 8 (19%) cases, pulmonary emboli 4 (9.5%) cases, stroke 2 (4.8%) cases and recent myocardic infarction 1 (2.4%) case.Critical Care March 2009 Vol 13 Suppl 1 29th International Symposium on Intensive Care and Emergency Medicine Figure 1 (abstract P162) S67Admission was unplanned for 36 (85.7%) parturients following emergency caesarean section. Status of the heart was severeaortic or mitral stenosis 21 (50%) cases, mitral or aorticregurgitation with heart failure 5 (11.9%) cases, mechanicalprosthetic requiring anticoagulation 8 case and peripartum cardiomyopathy 7(16.6%) cases. The median duration of stay was 4 days (range 1to 11 days), median Obstetrical SAPS was 19.3 (range 10 to 32)and APACHE II score was 13 (range 8 to 32). There were five(11.9%) maternal deaths, due to two cases PPCM, one cerebraldeath and two prothesis thrombus.Conclusions The majority of the cases of parturients was unbooked for antenatal care; this leads us to acknowledge theexistence of risk factors related to pregnancy. Maternal functionalclass is an important predictor of outcome; a high index ofsuspicion for cardiac diseases is essential to identify risk [1], oncethese patients are referred for a cardiologic opinion there is aneeded for cardiologist to develop a systematic approach to theirevaluation. Ideally these considerations should be commencedduring prepregnancy consultations, but continued throughoutpregnancy and the postpartum period [1].Reference1. Siu, Colman JM: Cardiovascular problems and pregnancy: an approach inhibition in the setting of septic cardiomyopathy A Van de Sandt1, R Windler1, A G\u00f6decke2, J S Schrader2, 1): P164 (doi: 10.1186/cc7328) Introduction Nitric oxide (NO) plays a central role in the patho- genesis of septic cardiomyopathy. However, the relative contri-bution nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and endothelialnitric oxide synthase (eNOS) remains unclear. The aim of this studyis to elucidate the influence of eNOS and iNOS on cardiacfunction, NO production rate and survival in the clinically relevantpolymicrobial cecum ligation and puncture and eNOS -/-mice were rendered septic by CLP or were sham operated. Immediately, the selectiveiNOS inhibitor 1400W (6.6 mg/kg body weight intraperitoneallyand subcutaneously) or carrier were applied. At 12 hours aftersepsis induction, heart function was assessed by pressure-volumeloops (1.4 Fr Millar catheter). NOx levels and endogenous NOproduction were measured via liquidchromatography and electron paramagnetic resonance evaluate apoptosis and inflammation, quantitativeimmunochemistry was applied. iNOS expression was analyzed viaRT-PCR.Results Cardiac function was significantly impaired solely in septic WT mice with diminished left ventricular developed pressure/d left-ventricular of iNOS in septic WT mice resulted inameliorated cardiovascular impairment, whereas no signs of septiccardiomyopathy were observed in septic eNOS -/-. In contrast to septic eNOS-/-mice, septic WT mice developed a significantincrease in NO3-, NO2-and bioactive NO levels. eNOS deficiency was associated with diminished apoptosis and modifiedinflammation. In eNOS -/-mice, a decreased iNOS expression was observed compared with septic WT mice. Both genetic eNOSdeficiency and pharmacologic iNOS inhibition was associated witha significant survival benefit. While eNOS -/-mice survived longest, additional iNOS inhibition in the latter diminished this benefitsignificantly.Conclusions In this clinically relevant model of sepsis, eNOS constitutes an important factor mediating septic cardiomyopathy.To what extent the diminished inflammation, apoptosis, NOproduction rate, iNOS expression and prolonged survival ineNOS -/-mice contribute to the observed benefits remains to be clarified in future studies. P165 Use of levosimendan in myocardial dysfunction due to sepsis J Vaitsis1, H Michalopoulou1, C 10.1186/cc7329) Introduction Myocardial dysfunction observed within the context of sepsis is partially due to desensitization of the cardiac muscle tovasoactive agents. Levosimendan, a calcium sensitizer and a K +- ATP channel opener, plays a significant role in the treatment ofmyocardial depression although its use in sepsis has not yet beenestablished.Methods We studied 42 patients (66.1 \u00b1 7.54 years, 24 male) who met the criteria for sepsis (infection by Gram-negative bacteriaand at least two SIRS criteria) and displayed severe heartdysfunction (cardiac index (CI) 2.2, ejection fraction (EF) 35%). The APACHE II score was 21.2 \u00b1 4.9. Patients were randomizedto receive additionally to their standard treatment levosimendan(0.1 g/kg/minute 24-hour infusion) (group A, n= 23) without loading dose or dobutamine (5 to 10 g/kg/minute 24-hour infusion) (group B, n= 19). Noradrenaline was used to preserve the mean arterial pressure above 65 mmHg. The primary goal was mortalityat 7 and 30 days.Results Mortality at 7 and 30 days was 30% and 60% in group A versus 36% and 68% in group B ( P = 0.05, P= 0.03, respec- tively). The CI and EF significantly increased in group A ( CI: 1.79 \u00b1 mean arterial pressure ( P = 0.035) were significantly increased. Conclusions Levosimendan compared with dobutamine improves the hemodynamic profile of septic patients with myocardial dys-function; and while there is evidence that it reduces mortality,further studies are needed to verify this. P166 Haemodynamic effects of levosimendan following cardiac surgery A Slezina, E Strike, M Bekers-Anchipolovskis Pauls Stradins Clinical (doi: 10.1186/cc7330) often requires inotropic support. Traditionally, phospho-diesterase inhibitors and catecholamines are myocardial oxygen demand [3]. The aim of our studywas to evaluate circulation following levosimendan infusion, to findout the efficiency of tissue oxygen supply and to evaluate otherinotrope dosage rates during levosimendan infusion.Methods Thirteen patients with acute heart failure following elective cardiac surgery under cardiopulmonary bypass treatedwith levosimendan and other inotropes were enrolled.Haemodynamic parameters (mean arterial pressure, central venouspressure, mean pulmonary artery pressure, cardiac index), PaO 2, SvO2, plasma lactate, cardiac troponin I and other inotropes rates were obtained at baseline, 30 minutes, 1 hour, 6 hours and24 hours after the start of levosimendan infusion. Levosimendanwas administered at a rate of 0.1 g/kg/minute (no bolus) with a total 24-hour dose of 12.5 mg for each patient. Other inotropicagents used were epinephrine (range 0.03 to 0.15 g/kg/min), norepinephrine (range 0.03 to 0.18 g/kg/min), dobutamine (range 3.5 to 7 g/kg/min) and corotrope (range 0.3 to 0.6 g/kg/min). Results Thirteen patients (nine female, four male) were investi- gated. Forty-six per cent of patients had III to IV (New York HeartAssociation) stage of congestive heart failure (ejection fraction<40%). Six patients died within 24 hours and were excluded.Maximal changes occurred 24 hours after levosimendan infusion.Mean arterial pressure increased, while the mean pulmonary arterypressure and central venous pressure decreased. The cardiacindex did not change considerably. Oxidative stress markersimproved. Mean infusion rates of epinephrine, dobutamine andcorotrope decreased, while the norepinephrine mean rate did notchange.Conclusions Levosimendan improves circulation by means of its positive inotropic effect, increases mean arterial pressure, anddecreases pulmonary pressure. Levosimendan could be a drug ofchoice in myocardial hypoxia, probably combined with Surg 2006, 81:1536-1546. P167 Effects of levosimendan started 24 hours before cardiopulmonary bypass in patients admitted to the ICU with an ejection fraction lower than 30% J Duchateau1, H Vanden Eede2 13(Suppl P167 (doi: 10.1186/cc7331) Introduction Patients with poor left ventricular function require inotropic drug support after cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Theuse of levosimendan in these patients is associated with a betterpostoperative function [1]. A recent study has attributed thisphenomenon to preconditioning effects of levosimendan [2].However, a recent study showed no benefit in starting levo-simendan before CPB [3]. We hypothesized that admitting thepatient to intensive care 24 hours before CPB and starting levo-simendan preoperatively could reduce postoperative cardiacdamage.Methods Fifty patients with an ejection fraction less than 30% scheduled for elective cardiac surgery with CPB receivedanesthesia with propofol, cisatracurium and sufentanil. The two Group A: g/kg/minute started before CPB after induction + dobutamine5 after the release of the Aox. Group B: levosimendan 0.1 g/kg/minute started on the ICU 24 hours before CPB + dobutamine 5 g/kg/minute started after the release Aox. Data analysis: SV, dobutamine, noradrenaline time anddose, cardiac enzymes, global hemodynamic variables, ICU andhospital length of stay. Statistical significance was accepted atP0.05. Results There was no difference in postoperative stroke volume and troponin I. The incidence of postoperative atrial fibrillation inboth groups was very low. There was a significant difference inICU length of stay but not in hospital length of stay.Conclusions In cardiac surgery patients with a low preoperative ejection fraction there is no difference in cardiac function andpostoperative troponin I levels between the two differentlevosimendan treatment modalities. The incidence of postoperativeatrial fibrillation is low when levosimendan is used perioperatively.There is a significant reduction in the ICU length of stay, but not inthe hospital length of stay.References1. ICU: series D Filipescu, M Luchian, A Prodea, O Gheanu, A Calugareanu, H Levosimendan, novel calcium sensitizer, has been shown to improve hemodynamic function in patients with acuteheart failure [1]. The aim of the study was to assess the hemo-dynamic effects of levosimendan as a rescue medication inaddition to conventional therapy in patients with low cardiac output(LCO) after cardiac surgery or myocardial infarction.Methods Forty-one patients with LCO admitted to the cardiac ICU between June 2004 and November 2008 were included in thisobservational hemodynamic study. Thirty-four patients wereadmitted after open heart surgery and seven patients for ischemicacute heart failure. Levosimendan (0.1 g/kg/min x 24 hours, without bolus) was added to conventional inotropes and/or intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) support. The measured parameterswere: cardiac output/index, pulmonary artery occlusion (LVEF), and mixed venousoxygen saturation (SvO 2). Baseline data were collected before levosimendan administration and the following datasets wereobtained at 6, 24 and 48 hours. Length of stay (LOS) in thecardiac ICU and inhospital mortality were also registered. Datawere expressed as the mean \u00b1 SD. Fisher's exact test and anonpaired t test were used when appropriate. P<0.05 was considered significant.Results All patients were on dobutamine and epinephrine. IABP support was used in 28 (68%) of cases. The addition of levo-simendan significantly improved cardiac index (from 2.27 \u00b1 0.9l/min/m 2to 30 9% at 57 \u00b1 13% at 48 hours ( P <0.01). PaoP decreased significantly only in the first 6 hours from 19 \u00b1 5 mmHgto 15 \u00b1 4 mmHg ( P <0.05). The mean LOS in the cardiac ICU was 14 \u00b1 13 days. Inhospital mortality was 24.4%.Critical Care March 2009 Vol 13 Suppl 1 29th International Symposium on Intensive Care and Emergency MedicineS69Conclusions In our case series, addition of levosimendan following ineffective conventional therapy resulted in substantial hemo-dynamic improvement. These preliminary results support the use oflevosimendan in patients with LCO as a rescue medication withfavorable short-term effects.Reference1. of levosimendan and inhaled nitric oxide on microcirculation in septic shock A Morelli1, A C Ertmer3, Rehberg3, 10.1186/cc7333) Introduction Microvascular resuscitation is a crucial therapeutic goal in sepsis. The current study was performed to test thehypothesis that a combination of levosimendan and inhaled nitricoxide (INO) may improve microvascular perfusion in septic shock.Methods After initial hemodynamic stabilization (mean arterial pressure between 65 and 75 mmHg; mixed venous oxygensaturation 65%), seven patients with catecholamine-dependent septic shock received intravenous levosimendan 0.2 g/kg/minute for 24 hours. At the end of the first 24 hours of the study period,inhaled nitric oxide (35 ppm) was added for another 12 hours.Sublingual microvascular perfusion was analyzed using the side-stream dark field method. The total vessel density (mm/mm 2), perfused vessel density (mm/mm2), De Backer score (1/mm), microcirculatory flow index of small vessels (MFIs) and micro-circulatory flow index of medium vessels (MFIm) were obtained atbaseline and after 24 and 36 hours.Results Levosimendan significantly ( P<0.05 vs. baseline) increased perfused vessel density from 11.3 mm/mm 2(10.7; 12.6) to 14.8 mm/mm2(13.7; 16.1) and MFIs from 2 (1.9; 2.2) to 3 (2.8; 3). Addition of INO further increased MFIm from 2.6 (2.5; 2.8) to 3(3; 3). Data are presented as median (25%; 75% range). Nostatistically significant differences were found in any of the otherinvestigated parameters.Conclusions The combination of Levosimendan and INO may improve microvascular perfusion in septic shock. P170 Effects of levosimendan on renal function in septic shock: a case-control study A Morelli1, C (doi: 10.1186/cc7334) Introduction Nonhemodynamic mechanisms of cell injury might play a role in the loss of glomerular filtration rate during sepsis [1].We hypothesized that levosimendan may positively affect renalfunction by a combination of systemic and regional hemodynamic,anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic effects. We thereforeperformed a case-control study to investigate the effects of levo-simendan on creatinine clearance in patients with septic shock.Methods Ninety-nine septic shock patients received levosimendan (0.2 g/kg/min for 24 hours) within the first 36 hours followingonset of septic shock. For each study patient, a control subject from a group of patients with septic shock of an institutionaldatabase was matched for Simplified Acute Physiology Score II,baseline creatinine concentration, delay from shock onset, age,and gender. Serum creatinine concentrations were analyzed justbefore the start of the 24-hour period of levosimendan infusion(baseline) and 96 hours after levosimendan had been initiated. Theglomerular filtration rate was estimated by applying theCockcroft-Gault formula.Results Compared with the control cohort, levosimendan significantly increased the glomerular filtration rate after 96 hours(62 \u00b1 46 vs. 50 \u00b1 33 ml/min, P< 0.05). In addition, the maximum serum creatinine concentration was lower in the levosimendangroup (2.2 \u00b1 1.3 vs. 2.6 \u00b1 2 mg/dl, P <0.05 vs. control) during the 96-hour study period.Conclusions The present data suggest that levosimendan may improve renal function in patients with septic shock.Reference1.

Group L received levosimendan 0.05 g/kg/ minute intravenously that was increased by 0.05 g/kg/minute every 30 minutes (maximum 0.2 g/kg/min). Group D received dobutamine 5 g/kg/minute intravenously which was increased by 5g/kg/minute every 30 minutes (maximum 20 g/kg/min). Rescue therapy consisted of dobutamine 10 g/kg/minute intravenously titrated ScvO 270% or a of achieved first. Hypotension mmHg) was MAP 65 mmHg. ScvO 2was recorded hourly. Cardiac output was measured continuously using the FloTrac device(Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, CA, USA). Continuous data wereanalyzed using repeated-measures ANOVA, and proportions werecompared using Fisher's exact test. Results are presented as themean \u00b1 SD unless otherwise indicated. Significance was definedas P<0.05. Results APACHE II scores were 21 \u00b1 7 versus 27 \u00b1 7 ( P= 0.02), and the ICU mortality was 10 (48%) versus 13 (62%) ( P= 0.35) for groups L and D, respectively. The cardiac index was lower ingroup L compared with group D (estimated marginal mean \u00b1 SEM:2.8 \u00b1 0.1 vs. 3.2 \u00b1 0.1, respectively, P<0.01) but the ScvO 2 changes over time did not differ between groups ( P >0.5). Norepinephrine was administered to 17 (81%) patients in group Land 21 (100%) in group D ( P= 0.04).Available online http://ccforum.com/supplements/13/S1S70Conclusions Dobutamine increased the cardiac index more than did levosimendan, although there was no difference between thetwo drugs with regard to their effects on ScvO 2.

P172 Levosimendan therapy does not improve survival of post-resuscitation cardiogenic shock patients P Soos1, D Becker1, ischemia requiring inotropic support.Methods During 3 years 3,852 patients with high-risk acute coronary syndrome (ACS) underwent percutaneous coronaryintervention in our department. In 106 cases ACS was compli-cated with cardiogenic shock (mean age: 68.6 \u00b1 1.2 years); be resuscitated (cardiopulmonaryresuscitation (CPR)). Short-term and long-term effects oflevosimendan on cardiac functions and on survival of cardiogenicshock and post-CPR patients were analyzed. Levosimendan wasadministrated in 39 of 106 cases as add-on therapy for patientswith impaired left ventricular function, by extensive wall motionabnormality and by high blood cardiac enzyme concentration.Levosimendan therapy was started in most cases on the second orthird day and applied for 6 hours as a continuous infusion (0.1g/kg/min). The mean time spent in the primary cardiac care center (inhospital time) was 6.0 \u00b1 0.4 days, and the whole follow-up was204.6 \u00b1 29.9 days long.Results In the post-CPR patient group there was no significant difference in survival according to levosimendan treatment duringshort-term follow-up 0.754). On the other hand, for nonresuscitated patients the survival rates were signifi-cantly higher in the levosimendan-treated patient group duringshort-term vs. 23.0%, P<0.001). The time inter- val between the onset of myocardial infarction and percutaneouscoronary intervention did not influence the effect of levosimendanon short-term and long-term mortality.Conclusions In summary, levosimendan may improve cardiac function and decrease short-term and even long-term mortality incardiogenic shock patients independently of the time interval ofmyocardial infarction. This positive effect of levosimendan may beabolished by post-CPR patients. P173 Study of hemodynamics in patients treated with landiolol in the ICU T Imabayashi, H Murayama, C Kuroki, N Kiyonaga, T Oryouji, T A P173 (doi: 10.1186/cc7337) Introduction We experienced patients whose cardiac functions were maintained or deteriorated during the treatment of a short-acting -blocker, landiolol. We therefore investigated the effects of landiolol on the cardiac function in patients.Methods From January through December 2007, 21 patients were selected if they had tachycardia (heart rate (HR) >100 beats/min)and they were treated with continuous infusion of landiolol.Hemodynamics were recorded using pulmonary artery catheters atfour time points (before administration of landiolol, 1 hour afterbeginning of administration, immediately before discontinuation ofadministration, and 1 hour after discontinuation of administration).Infusion of landiolol was discontinued if the HR fell below90 beats/min or the cardiac index (CI) fell below 2.0 l/min/m 2. The paired Student ttest was used to compare the differences. P<0.05 was statistically significant. Results Between the point before administration of landiolol (2.4 \u00b1 1.8 (mean \u00b1 SD) g/kg/min) and 1 hour after beginning of adminis- tration, although the HR was decreased from 137 \u00b1 20 beats/minto 109 \u00b1 20 beats/min ( P<0.01), the stroke index (SI) was increased from 20.4 \u00b1 8.1 ml/beats/m 2to 22.5 \u00b1 7.0 ml/beats/m2, and thus (2.76 \u00b1 1.05 l/min/m2and 2.43 \u00b1 0.78 l/min/m2). Between the point before discontinuation of administration (1.4 \u00b1 1.1 g/kg/min) and 1 hour after discontinua- tion of administration, the HR was not increased significantly (93 \u00b118 beats/min and 100 \u00b1 16 beats/min), however 2to 25.7 \u00b1 5.4 ml/beats/m2 (P<0.05), and therefore the increased 1.93 \u00b1 0.54 l/min/m2to 2.50 \u00b1 0.40 l/min/m2(P<0.01). Infusion of landiolol was discontinued because the HR fell below 90 beats/min in 12patients and the CI fell below 2.0 l/min/m 2in nine cases. There were no significant differences in the catecholamine index,pulmonary artery pressure, and central venous pressure.Conclusions We investigated hemodynamics in 21 patients who used landiolol and recognized the effects of rate control anddepression of the SI and the CI; thus when we use landiolol, wehave to pay attention to the HR and cardiac function [1].Reference1.

P174 intravenous diltiazem model endotoxin-induced pulmonary hypertension Kyparissa, V Grosomanidis, Kotzampassi, A 10.1186/cc7338) Introduction Pulmonary hypertension (PAH) is a life-threatening disease commonly seen in ICU septic patients. PAH is characterizedby alterations in the pulmonary circulation leading to right ventricularfailure and is associated with poor outcome in such patients. Variousagents such as nitric oxide, prostaglandins and phosphodiesteraseinhibitors have been used for its treatment. Drugs that inducepulmonary vasodilatation, increase contractility and maintain a stablehaemodynamic profile seem an attractive treatment option in acutePAH patients. However, there is lack of evidence-based guidelines inthe current medical literature. Although oral diltiazem has beenshown to improve haemodynamics in chronic PAH patients, it hasnot been used for the treatment of acute PAH. The aim of thepresent study was to evaluate the effects of intravenous diltiazem ona porcine model of acute PAH during sepsis.Methods PAH was induced in 16 anaesthetized, mechanically ventilated pigs (25 kg) by intravenous infusion of 0.5 mg/kg LPS(Escherichia coli , 111: B4) in a period of 30 minutes. After LPS administration, animals were randomly divided into two groups.Group A received intravenous diltiazem 280 to 400 g/kg, andCritical Care March 2009 Vol 13 Suppl 1 29th International Symposium on Intensive Care and Emergency MedicineS71Group B an equal dose of placebo (normal saline) and served as the control. Haemodynamic measurements, including parametersof systemic and pulmonary circulation, were performed before andafter LPS administration and every 20 minutes for 2 hours.Results After LPS infusion, both systolic pulmonary pressure (PAPs) and diastolic pulmonary pressure (PAPd) exhibited astatistically significant increase (PAPs from 18 \u00b1 1 to 48 \u00b1 7 mmHg,P <0.01 and PAPd, from 7.7 \u00b1 0.7 to 27 \u00b1 4 mmHg, P <0.01) and remained elevated over time. Diltiazem administration reducedsignificantly both PAPs and PAPd in relation to placebo(P<0.001), but not to baseline levels. The heart rate, cardiac output and systemic haemodynamics exhibited no differencebetween groups throughout the time period.Conclusions Intravenous diltiazem was associated with a reduction of pulmonary pressure without any systemic hypotensionin a porcine model of endotoxin-induced acute PAH. This mayrepresent a significant advance in the treatment of acute PAH.Potential clinical implications merit further study. P175 Acute liver failure induced by intravenous amiodarone in the cardiac care unit: retrospective study of 3 years E Zima, V Szabo, I Osztheimer, T Barany, D Becker, L Molnar, P Soos, L Geller, B Introduction Amiodarone is the antiarrhythmic drug of choice in treatment of patients suffering from acute tachyarrhythmias andhaemodynamic instability due to impaired cardiac function. Theintravenous form of amiodarone hydrochloride (IvAm) has individualantiarrhythmic, rate-controlling efficacy, and the dosage isempirical. The main adverse effects are hypotension, severebradycardia, asystole, acute heart failure, and impaired liverfunction. Acute liver failure (ALF) is a known but rare complicationof IvAm that may be reversible by eliminating the infusion in mostcases. The few papers in the literature suppose ALF may becaused by polysorbate 80, the vehicle of IvAm. Oral administrationdoes not to have such an adverse effect, therefore IvAm can bechanged to oral form in any cases.Methods Our aim was to investigate retrospectively the incidence of ALF and relation of IvAm and ALF in cardiac patients. Thehistory, treatment sheets and laboratory parameters of 11,722patients treated in the Heart Center between 2005 and 2007 wereanalyzed. Patients were considered severe ALF patients iftransaminase levels exceeded 80 x upper limit of normal (ULN)during their stay in our clinic. The cutoff point was determined todifferentiate ALF patients from heart failure and myocardial infarctpatients with elevated transaminase levels.Results According to the enzyme levels, 55 patients suffered from severe ALF during the 3 years; 26 of them had IvAm treatment. Onthe basis of treatment sheets, start and elimination of IvAm treatment,status of acute myocardial infarct and heart failure and transaminasekinetics, eight patients had ALF induced by IvAm. Indication foramiodarone was atrial fibrillation ( n= 6) tachycardia. multipliers ULN were 379 \u00b1 190 aspartateaminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, 57 \u00b1 22 atlactate dehydrogenase. The time from start of IvAm to detection ofALF was 17 \u00b1 4.6 hours. One-quarter of these patients died in ALF.Liver enzymes decreased to 10 x ULN during 2.5 \u00b1 0.6 days.Conclusions ALF is a rare but potentially life-threatening adverse effect of IvAm. Authors suggest monitoring liver enzymes from thestart of IvAm treatment. Rapid elevation in liver enzyme levels indi-cates a hepatotoxic effect of IvAm. In these cases the immediatecessation of IvAm administration and start of intensive care is life- saving. P176 Prevention of postoperative arrhythmias and 20% and approaches 40% after pneumonectomy.Postoperative arrhythmia is associated with higher morbidity andmortality [1]. The objective of this study was to compare the effectof oral -blocker (celiprolol) and intravenous magnesium (Mg) (SVA) pulmonaryresection.Methods Twenty-six patients undergoing pneumonectomy to receive either celiprolol (group 1,n= 13) or intravenous Mg (group 2, n= 13). Patients were excluded if they had a history of congestive heart failure, second-degree orgreater heart block, a history of SVA, or were receiving oral -blocker, diltiazem, or verapamil. Patients of group 1 received oral celiprolol(100 mg every 8 hours) starting before operation and continued for10 days postoperatively. Group 2 received intravenously 2 g Mg atthe time of the thoracotomy, at 6 hours then every day for 3 days. Allpatients were followed clinically with at least four daily ECGs for up to10 days. Statistical analyses were performed using the statisticalpackage SPSS version 11.0. P<0.05 was considered significant. Results The mean age of the 26 patients was 53 \u00b1 14 years. SVA developed in 42.3% of the patients and atrial fibrillation (AF) in19.2%. The mean cardiac frequency was 82 \u00b1 10 pulses/minute ingroup 1 versus 92 \u00b1 10 pulses/minute in group 2. The incidenceof SVA was significantly higher in group 2 (30.4% vs. 11.4%,P= 0.047). However, the incidence of AF was similar in the two groups (group 1: 3.8% vs. group 2: 15.2%, P = 0.135). The peak for the occurrence of SVA was on postoperative day 2. Rightpneumonectomy and intrapericardial resection were not associated with increased development of postoperative SVA. No seriousadverse effects caused by celiprolol or magnesium were seen.Conclusions Terzi and colleagues [2] demonstrated a significant reduction in the incidence of AF using Mg. In our study Mg has norole in the prophylaxis of SVA in lung surgery. Perioperativeceliprolol can reduce the frequency of SVA without serious sideeffects. In fact, increased sympathetic activity is one of thepredominant factors in the cause of of atrial tachyarrhythmias after thoracic 44:300-303. P177 Low-dose dopamine is useful in kidney transplantation M Ciapetti, S Di Valvasone, M Bonizzoli, V Marcellino, A Di Filippo, A 2009, 10.1186/cc7341) Introduction transplantation, low-dose dopamine (LDD) (0.5 to 2.5 g/kg/min) is used to increase urine output and toAvailable online http://ccforum.com/supplements/13/S1S72prevent arterial vasospasm and acute tubular necrosis, but there is some controversy about its use [1-4]. The aim of the study was toevaluate the effectiveness of LDD in the early post-transplantperiod.Methods Fifty kidney transplant recipients admitted to the ICU in the early post-transplant period were allocated to two groups: A(n= 20) treated and B ( n= 30) not treated with LDD. All patients underwent postoperative intensive monitoring, control of bloodsample and kidney functioning at 0, 6 and 12 hours in the ICU.Postoperative therapy was the same for all patients, except forLDD. The intravascular volume was kept effective by maintainingcentral >5 mmHg and ScVO 2>70%. We transplant kidney parameters (age, sex,death cause, ischaemia time), recipients' parameters (age, sex,weight, height, BMI, duration of dialysis, end stage renal disease,Simplified Acute Physiology Score II), intraoperative parameters(metabolic, respiratory and hemodynamic), hemodynamic andkidney functioning parameters in the ICU (heart rate, mean arterialpressure, central venous pressure, ScVO 2, lactate, diuresis, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, fluid balance), and outcome parameters(ICU length of stay, postoperative complications, acute rejection at28 days, mortality at 6 months).Results There were no significant difference in donors' and graft data, recipients' data, intraoperative data, hemodynamic and kidneyfunctioning data and outcomes in both groups. The significantdifferences between the two groups of patients were: SimplifiedAcute Physiology Score II was higher in group B (A: 24.4 \u00b1 12.9;B: 31.2 \u00b1 9.4; P <0.05); heart rate was higher in group A at each observation time (at 6 hours A: <0.05); length of stay was shorter in group B (A: 28.9 \u00b1 17.3; B: 20 \u00b1 7.2; P<0.05). Conclusions LDD in kidney transplantation does not improve kidney function during the postoperative period, nor short-term andmedium-term outcome, but it increases the heart rate and ICUlength of stay.References1.

Donmez A, et al.: 1999, et Low-dose nitroglycerin improves microcirculation in hospitalized patients failure CA Den Uil1, WK Lagrand2, PE Spronk3, P178 (doi: 10.1186/cc7342) Introduction Impaired tissue perfusion is often observed in patients with acute heart failure. We tested whether low-dosenitroglycerin (NTG) improves microcirculatory blood flow inpatients admitted for acute heart failure.Methods In 20 acute heart failure patients, NTG was given as intravenous infusion at a fixed dose of 33 g/minute. Using sidestream dark field imaging, sublingual microvascular perfusionwas evaluated before (T0, average of two baseline measurements)and 15 minutes after initiation of NTG (T1). In a subgroup of sevenpatients, NTG was stopped for 20 minutes, whereupon sidestreamdark field measurements were repeated. Capillaries were definedas the microvessels with a diameter of <20 mm. The perfusedcapillary density (PCD) was determined as the parameter of tissueperfusion. Values are expressed as the median and interquartile range (P25; P75).Results The median age of the subjects was 60 (52; 73) years and 65% were male. Patients were in a stable condition beforestarting NTG. NTG decreased the central venous pressure (17(13; 19) mmHg at T0 vs. 16 (13; 17) mmHg at T1, P = 0.03) and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (23 (18; 31) mmHg at T0 vs.19 (16; 25) mmHg (10.7 P= 0.01). After cessation of NTG, PCD returned to baseline values ( P = 0.04). Conclusions Low-dose NTG significantly reduces cardiac filling pressures and improves microvascular perfusion in patientsadmitted for acute heart failure. P179 intravenous nitroglycerin and noradrenaline on gastric microvascular perfusion in an experimental model of gastric tube reconstruction M Buise1, D Gommers2, J De Jonge2, M Van Genderen2, Bommel2 1Catharina Eindhoven, the P179 (doi: 10.1186/cc7343) Introduction Esophagectomy with gastric tube reconstruction is the surgical treatment for cancer of the esophagus. The perfusionof the distal part of the gastric tube depends exclusively on themicrocirculation, making it susceptible to hypoperfusion andischemia. It is unknown whether an increased perfusion pressurecan exert a beneficial effect on gastric tissue perfusion.Methods For this purpose we performed a gastric tube recon- struction in 12 pigs, mean bodyweight 32 \u00b1 1 kg (mean \u00b1 SE).Besides systemic hemodynamic parameters, the gastric micro-vascular blood flow (MBF) was assessed on pylorus, corpus andfundus with laser Doppler flowmetry and gastric microvascular 2 saturation (mHbSO2) and hemoglobin concentration (mHbcon) with spectrophotometry. Animals were evenly randomized over twogroups: in both groups the mean arterial pressure was increasedfrom 50 to 110 mmHg with infusion of noradrenaline; however, in thenitroglycerin (NTG) group the central venous pressure wasmaintained below 10 mmHg throughout the entire experiment withintravenous NTG. In this way, we aimed to increase the perfusionpressure gradient over the gastric tube tissue.Results Central venous and pulmonary capillary wedge pressures were lower in the NTG group. Although the systemic circulationtended to be more dynamic in the NTG group at baseline, allsystemic hemodynamic parameters were similar in both groupsthroughout the experiment. Baseline MBF was all-over higher in theNTG group. Following surgery, in both groups the MBF decreasedseverely especially in the upper gastric tube. At higher meanarterial pressure (MAP), MBFs tended to be higher than at thelowest MAP levels. Overall, MBFs were higher in the NTG group.mHbcon levels increased significantly with the initial decreases inflow and remained lower in the NTG group. mHbSO 2values were no different between groups and did not change accordingly atdifferent MAP levels.Conclusions In our experimental model, tissue perfusion is severely compromised following formation of the gastric tube; thiseffect is aggravated by systemic hypotension independent fromcardiac output. Venous congestion might contribute to this effectand can be prevented with continuous intravenous administrationof NTG. Clinical studies will have to demonstrate an effect onanastomotic healing and outcome.Critical Care March 2009 Vol 13 Suppl 1 29th International Symposium on Intensive Care and Emergency MedicineS73P180 Norepinephrine: more than blood pressure cosmetics? L Hiltebrand, S Brandt, O Kimberger, E Koepfli University 2009, 13(Suppl 1): P180 (doi: 10.1186/cc7344) Introduction Norepinephrine (NE) is used to increase blood pressure (mean arterial pressure (MAP)) if hypotension arises. Increasing the perfusion pressure may increase blood flow in regions at risk. But vasoconstriction might worsen microcirculatory flow. We investigated the effects of NE on systemic, splanchnic and microcirculatory (microvascular blood flow (MBF)) blood flow in hypotensive pigs after major surgery. Methods Twenty-seven pigs (30 \u00b1 3 kg) were anesthetized, ventilated and underwent laparotomy. They were randomized to one of the following treatments: Group Low received 3 ml/kg/hour Ringer's lactate (RL) throughout the study. Group H received hydroxyethyl starch (130/0.4) to maintain SvO260%. Group NE received 3 ml/kg/hour RL and NE to increase blood pressure to 65 and to 75 mmHg to match the MAP of Group H. Systemic, splanchnic, MBF blood flow and intestinal tissue oxygen tension were measured. Results Baseline MAP was similar in all groups. To increase MAP to 65 and 75 mmHg, 0.035 and 0.12 g/kg/minute NE wereneeded, respectively. The effects of NE on blood pressure, sys- temic, regional and MBF blood flow are shown in Figures 1 and 2. Conclusions NE increased MAP efficiently but had no beneficial effects on regional or MBF in the splanchnic region. This suggests that administration of vasopressors such as NE could be an unsafe way to maintain MAP because it may leave intestinal hypoperfusion undetected. P181 Vasopressin in pediatric vasodilatory Fraser3 1McMaster University, Hamilton, ON, Canada; 2Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, ON, Canada; 3Children's Hospital of Western Ontario, London, ON, Canada Critical Care 2009, 13(Suppl 1): P181 (doi: 10.1186/cc7345) Introduction Vasopressin has been suggested as a useful vaso- active agent in the support of vasodilatory shock in adults; however, its effect in children is unclear. We hypothesized that low-dose vasopressin in this population, administered as an adjunctive vasoactive agent, would lead to more rapid reversal of vasodilatory shock when compared with placebo. Methods In this multicenter, double-blind trial, children with clinical evidence of vasodilatory shock were randomized to receive either low-dose vasopressin (0.0005 0.002 vasoactive agents. Vasoactive infusions were titrated according to established guidelines to maintain target mean arterial pressure and adequate perfusion. The primary outcome was the time to vasoactive-free hemodynamic stability. Secondary outcomes included mortality, organ-failure free days, length of stay, and adverse and serious adverse events. Results Sixty-five out of 69 children (94%) who were randomized received the study drug (33 vasopressin, 32 placebo) and were included in the analysis. There was no significant difference between the vasopressin and placebo groups in the time to vaso- active-free hemodynamic stability (49.7 vs. 47.1 hours, respec- tively, 0.85). There were 10 deaths (30%) in the vasopressin group and five deaths (15.6%) in the placebo group (relative risk = 1.94; 95% CI = 0.75 to 5.05, P = 0.24). There were no significant differences between the two groups with respect to organ-failure free days (22 vs. 25.5 days, P= 0.11), ventilator-free days (16.5 vs. 23 days, P = 0.15), length of pediatric critical care unit stay (8 vs. 8.5 days, P = 0.93), or the adverse and serious adverse event rate ratios (12.0%, 95% CI = -2.6 to 26.7, P = 0.15; and 3.2%, 95% CI = -13.7 to 7.8, P = 0.55, respectively). Conclusions In this multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled trial in pediatric patients with vasodilatory shock, low-dose vasopressin did not demonstrate any beneficial effects but a concerning trend in mortality.

S74vasoconstriction, V2 receptor stimulation promotes coagulation, at least in part through an increase in plasma von Willebrand factorantigen (vWF:Ag) activity. We hypothesized that, at an intravenousinfusion rate representative of the requirements for the treatment ofsepsis-induced vasodilatory hypotension in sheep [2], AVPprovides procoagulant hypothesis bymeasuring vWF:Ag activity in unanesthetized healthy sheep duringadministration of AVP in comparison with the vWF:Ag activityincrease induced by the selective V2 receptor agonist desmo-pressin (dDAVP).Methods After two to four measurements of vWF:Ag activity and hemoglobin (Hb) over a 1-hour baseline (BL) period, 13 femalesheep were randomly administered one of two treatments: an intra-venous bolus of dDAVP (1 pmol/kg/min; n= 6). vWF:Ag activity and Hb were measured every 30 minutes over 2 hours from the time ofdDAVP administration or the initiation of AVP administration. Foreach sheep, vWF:Ag activity was corrected for plasma volume bycalculating the vWF:Ag activity/Hb ratio and was expressed aspercentage of the mean BL value. Data are expressed as the mean\u00b1 SEM.Results Following dDAVP bolus injection and during AVP infusion, the vWF:Ag activity/Hb ratio increased to a maximum of 135 \u00b1 4%(n= 7) and 135 \u00b1 6% 0.002 vs. BL, respectively). The did not increase beyond the maximal fluctuationrange of BL measurements in two out of the six sheep treated withAVP (maximum increases of 96% and 101%).Conclusions At an intravenous infusion rate representative of the requirements for the treatment of sepsis-induced vasodilatoryhypotension in sheep [2], the V1a/V2 receptor dual-agonist AVPincreased vWF:Ag activity to the same extent as the selective V2receptor agonist dDAVP. Because of its V2 receptor agonistactivity, the use of AVP may potentially amplify the microcirculationimpairment caused by sepsis-induced coagulopathy.References1.

(doi: 10.1186/cc7347) Introduction The present study was designed as a prospective, randomized, laboratory experiment to compare the effects of aselective metabolic changes, mesenteric blood flow (Qma)and mortality using a clinically relevant model of septic shock [1].Methods Fecal peritonitis was induced in 21 anesthetized, invasively monitored, mechanically ventilated sheep. A combinationof crystalloids and 6% hydroxyethyl starch was titrated to Following the time (ST), defined asmean arterial pressure (MAP) <60 mmHg, sheep were randomly assigned to receive either a continuous infusion of 1 g/kg/hour V2-antagonist, 0.05 g/kg/minute each). was titrated up to a maximum of 1 g/kg/minute to maintain MAP at 70 \u00b1 5 mmHg in all groups. Data are expressed as the mean \u00b1 SEM.Results No significant differences between groups were detected at baseline and ST. The cardiac index and urine flow were similarbetween groups. The V1-agonist led to a higher Qma than in bothother groups from 5 to 8 hours after ST ( P <0.05 each). Compared with AVP, selective V1-agonism stabilized MAP moreeffectively and allowed a reduction in cumulative norepinephrinerequirements from 4 to 8 hours. The V1-agonist and the V2-antagonist did not differ in these variables. V2-antagonismattenuated the decrease in base excess compared with both othergroups and was associated with increased fluid requirementscompared with V1-agonism (18 \u00b1 1 vs. 14 \u00b1 (3.5 mmol/l vs. 5.5 \u00b1 0.2mmol/l, P <0.02 each) and prolonged survival (13 \u00b1 1 hour and 14 \u00b1 1 hour vs. 10 \u00b1 1 hour; P <0.01 Conclusions stabilized hemodynamics more the prolonged survival time,selective V1-agonism and V2-antagonism might be superior toAVP infusion in septic shock. Future studies are warranted toinvestigate the combination of these two therapeutic strategies.Reference1.

P184 Adjunct terlipressin effect on vital organ perfusion during advanced life support in a porcine model of ventricular fibrillation A Truhlar, V Cerny, Z Turek, D Kodejskova, J Suchankova Charles University in 2009, 13(Suppl 1): P184 (doi: 10.1186/cc7348) Introduction Drug administration is an integral part of advanced life support (ALS). The coronary perfusion pressure (CorPP) duringcardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) predicts the probability ofreturn of spontaneous circulation, while the cerebral perfusionpressure (CPP) affects brain damage. Guidelines for cardiac arresttreatment recommend giving adrenaline (ADR) although there is noevidence showing long-term benefit from any medication. Vaso-pressin was probably the most effective alternative studied in bothexperimental and clinical trails. As vasopressin has never beenavailable in Europe, we evaluated the effect of its syntheticanalogue, terlipressin (TER), on vital organ perfusion in an animalmodel of ventricular fibrillation (VF) (Terlipressin in Cardiac Arrest(TERCA) study). The use of TER in VF has never been studiedbefore.Methods A prospective, experimental study in 14 domestic pigs (30 to 35 kg) randomly assigned into two groups: A (ADR + TER;n= 7) and B (ADR + NaCl; n= 7). CorPP and CPP were calculated from right atrial, aortic and intracerebral pressures. VFwas induced using an intracardiac pacing electrode. After5 minutes of untreated arrest, chest compressions were startedusing the AutoPulse system (Zoll Circulation, Sunnyvale, CA, USA)Critical Care March 2009 Vol 13 Suppl 1 29th International Symposium on Intensive Care and Emergency MedicineS75simulating hands-only CPR. At a time of 15 minutes after onset of VF, ALS was started for the next 45 minutes. ADR 30 g/kg and TER 30 g/kg were administered intravenously 19 minutes after induction of VF in group A, while ADR and NaCl were given ingroup B. Equal doses of ADR were then repeated every 3 minutesin both groups. The design of the study reflected the real-life timeintervals achieved in clinical trials. The primary endpoint was tocompare CorPP and CPP between groups A and B. Data wereanalysed using SigmaStat. P<0.05 was considered statistically significant.Results CorPP (mean \u00b1 SD) measured 35, 40 and 45 minutes after the onset of VF was 12 \u00b1 4, 13 \u00b1 4 and 11 \u00b1 6 mmHg ingroup A (with adjunct TER), and 6 \u00b1 4, 2 \u00b1 7 and 1 \u00b1 group B ( P<0.05, P<0.01 and P<0.01). CPP at the same times was 23 \u00b1 7, 24 \u00b1 8 and 20 \u00b1 7 mmHg in group A, and13 \u00b1 7, 8 \u00b1 6 and 6 \u00b1 5 mmHg in control group B ( P<0.05, P<0.01 and P <0.01). Conclusions Our results suggest a significant increase of CorPP and CPP after early adjunct treatment of VF with TER added tostandard doses of ADR during prolonged CPR in pigs.Acknowledgement Supported by research project MZO 00179906. P185 Vasopressin versus norepinephrine infusion in patients with vasoplegic shock after cardiac surgery L Hajjar, A Roquim, R Kalil Filho, F Galas, T Ticom, (doi: 10.1186/cc7349) Vasopressin is commonly used as an adjunct to catecholamines to support blood pressure in refractory septicshock. Its effect on vasoplegic shock after cardiac surgery isunknown. We hypothesized that low-dose vasopressin ascompared with norepinephrine would decrease the length of stayin the ICU in patients submitted to cardiac surgery with a pump.Methods We assigned patients who presented vasoplegic shock after cardiac surgery in the first 24 hours after arrival in the ICU.During 6 months, out of 458 patients undergoing cardiac surgery,82 developed vasoplegia shock and participated in the study. Werandomly assigned patients to receive norepinephrine (initial dosesof 5 mg) or vasopressin (0.01 to 0.04 U/min). All vasopressorinfusions were titrated and tapered according to protocols tomaintain a target blood pressure. The primary endpoint was thelength of ICU stay. Secondary endpoints were mortality, timing ofneeding vasopressors, incidence of organ dysfunction and adverseeffects.Results A total of 82 patients were included in the analysis - 42 patients received norepinephrine and 40 patients receivedvasopressin. There was a significant difference between thenorepinephrine and vasopressin groups in the length of ICU stay(4.2 days vs. 7.3 days, P <0.005). Also, the vasopressin group of patients presented a lower incidence of renal failure comparedwith the norepinephrine group (4.5% vs. 8.9%, P<0.001). There was no significant difference in the overall rates of adverse events,rates of mortality and timing of vasopressor therapy.Conclusions Low-dose vasopressin reduced the length of ICU stay and the incidence of renal failure in patients with vasoplegicshock after cardiac surgery compared with norepinephrine. Also,the vasopressin group did not present more adverse MW, et al.: Circulation 2003, 107:2313-2319. Crit Care Med 2007, 35:2280-2285.P186 Arterial catheter-related infection according to the catheter site L Lorente, S Palmero, J Iribarren, J Jim\u00e9nez, C Garcia, R Galv\u00e1n, J are many studies on arterial catheter- related infection (ACRI), there are scarce data on such infectionaccording to the catheter access site. Which particular arterialcatheter site is associated with a higher risk of infection remainscontroversial. The guidelines of the Centers for Disease Controland Prevention make no recommendation about which site or sitesminimize the risk of catheter-related infection. In previous studies,we have found a higher incidence of ACRI in arterial femoral thanin radial access sites. In the present study, we increased thenumber of arterial catheters in order to increase the probability offinding significant differences in the incidence of ACRI betweenother arterial accesses. The objective of this study was to analyzethe incidence of ACRI according to different access sites.Methods We performed a prospective observational study of all consecutive patients admitted to our 24-bed medical and surgicalICU of a 650-bed university hospital during 6 years (1 May 2000 to30 April 2006). ACRI included catheter-related local infection andcatheter-related bloodstream infection.Results A total of 1,085 arterial femoral catheters were inserted during 6,497 days, 2,088 radial during 12,007 days, 174 dorsalispedis catheters during 1,050 days and 141 brachial during852 days. We detected 33 cases of ACRI (11 with bacteremiaand 22 with local infection) in femoral catheters, 12 cases of ACRI(three with bacteremia and nine with local infection) in radialcatheters, zero in dorsalis pedis catheters, and zero in brachialcatheters. The ACRI incidence per 1,000 arterial catheter dayswas significantly higher for femoral (5.08) than for radial (1.76)access (OR = 5.1, 95% CI = 2.56 to 10.81; P0.001), dorsalis pedis (0) access (OR = 7.6; = 1.37 to infinite; P= 0.01) and brachial (0) access (OR = 6.2, 95% CI = 1.11 to infinite;P= 0.03). We did not find significant differences in the ACRI incidence per 1,000 arterial catheter days between radial anddorsalis pedis (OR = 1.5; 95% CI = 0.24 to infinite; P= 0.73); and between radial and brachial access 1.2; 95% CI = 0.20 toinfinite; P= 0.88). Conclusions Our results suggest that femoral arterial access should be avoided in order to minimize the risk of arterial catheter-related infection. P187 Inline filtration reduces the incidence of systemic inflammatory response syndrome in critically ill children T Jack, M Boehne, BE Brent, A Wessel, M Sasse Medical Care 2009, 13(Suppl 1): P187 (doi: 10.1186/cc7351) Introduction Particulate contamination of infusion solution implies a potential health risk for intensive care patients with a backgroundof debilitation and impaired host responses. Particles have beenshown to induce thrombogenesis, deterioration of microcirculationand modulation of immunoresponse. We assessed the effect ofinline filtration on the reduction of major complications in critically illchildren (Clinical Trials.gov ID NCT 00209768).Methods In a randomised, prospective trial, paediatric patients admitted to the interdisciplinary pediatric ICU of a tertiary universityAvailable online http://ccforum.com/supplements/13/S1S76hospital were assigned to either a control or an interventional group, the latter receiving inline filtration (infusion filter PallELD96LLCE/ NOE96E, Braun Intrapur Lipid/Intrapur Neonat Lipid)throughout infusion therapy. Prior to this study, the infusionregimen was optimised to prevent precipitation and incompati-bilities of solutions and drugs. Primary objectives were a reductionin the incidence of sepsis, thrombosis, systemic inflammatoryresponse syndrome (SIRS) or organ failure (liver, lung, kidney,circulation).Results Interim analysis of 398 children (171 female, 227 male, mean age 72 months) revealed a heterogeneous background ofunderlying diagnoses and a Gaussian distribution to either thecontrol group (208 patients) or inline filtration group (190patients). First analyses demonstrated a significant reduction in theincidence of SIRS for the interventional group (95% CI = 68 to112; P<0.035). Conclusions The occurrence of sepsis, SIRS, thrombosis or organ failure often complicates the course of disease in critically illpatients. Inline filtration is most effective reducing the incidence ofSIRS. Additional analyses are expected to confirm the preliminaryresults as well as to further identify the influence of inline filtrationon other complications. P188 Central venous catheter infection: incidence and risk factors G Lane, F Bell, M Bellamy University of Leeds, UKCritical Care 2009, 13(Suppl 1): P188 (doi: 10.1186/cc7352) Introduction performed a retrospective analysis of central venous catheter (CVC) infection over a 12-month period in atertiary referral teaching hospital general ICU to establishincidence of infection and clinical factors associated with CVCinfection.Methods We reviewed data from all patients admitted to the ICU over a 12-month period. CVC tips from surviving patients werecultured. Patient demographic data, diagnoses and therapeuticinterventions from our audit database were entered into a spread-sheet. Blood pressure, pulse, temperature and ventilatory datawere collected from ICU charts. Haematological and biochemicalvariables were accessed from the hospital results server. Otherpotential risk factors entered included the use of steroids,chemotherapy, diabetes, renal replacement therapy, tracheostomyor arterial catheter. Data were anonymised, and nested logic arrayswere used for processing and error checking. Risk factor analysiswas performed by logistic regression against the presence of apositive CVC culture.Results Of 865 patients, 191 had no CVC. Data were inadequate in a further 109 patients. In the remaining 565 patients, 836 CVCswere inserted. The median patient age was 61 years (IQR 49 to71 years) with 51.6% male. In total, 19.5% of CVCs were two-lumen vascular access catheters for dialysis, and 80.5% were four-lumen CVCs for monitoring and drug infusion. A total of 637central lines were inserted via the internal jugular route, 106femoral and 71 subclavian. The mean number of CVCs per personwas 1.47, median 1, range 1 to 15. One hundred and nineteencatheters (14.2%) became infected. The median duration of CVCwas 4 days (IQR 2 to 8 days). Logistic regression correctlypredicted CVC infection on 85.9% of occasions, with a specificityof 97.4%, but a relatively poor sensitivity of 18.6%. Independentlypredictive factors included subclavian placement (OR = 0.35),standard central line (v dialysis catheter, OR = 0.75); days ofcathet erisation (1.31), peak temperature (1.42) and peak C-reactive protein (1.002).Conclusions In this study, subclavian placement was associated with a threefold reduction in risk of infection. There was a 31% perday increase in infection, and this was likely to be associated withpyrexia and a raised C-reactive protein. Interestingly, diseasefactors such as diabetes, chemotherapy and steroids wereunimportant. These data call into question the common practice ofpreferentially placing CVCs in the internal jugular vein. P189 Impact of bloodstream infections on ICU mortality M Michalia, M Kompoti, G Kallitsi, I Vassiliadis, M Charitidi, P 13(Suppl 1): P189 (doi: 10.1186/cc7353) Introduction Previous studies have investigated the impact of different types of bloodstream infection (BSI) (primary, secondary,catheter-related) on the outcome of critically ill patients, includingonly the first BSI episode in the analysis [1-3]. Our study aimed atevaluating the impact of different BSI types on ICU mortalityincluding the total number of each type of BSI in the analysis.Methods All patients admitted in the ICU during a 46-month period were prospectively followed. Data recorded included:demographics, medical history, admission category (medical,elective surgical, emergency surgical, trauma), APACHE II score atadmission to the ICU, BSI episodes, isolated pathogens,continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) implementation,blood product transfusions, ICU length of stay (LOS) and ICUoutcome. BSIs were defined as primary (PBSI), secondary,catheter-related or mixed based on standard criteria. Data wereanalyzed with logistic regression, and the statistical significancelevel set at P <0.05. Results Four hundred and twenty-six consecutive patients (295 males, 131 females) were included in the analysis. Age (mean \u00b1SD) was 52.5 \u00b1 19.4 years, APACHE II score at admission to theICU 18.3 \u00b1 6.6. The BSI incidence density was 26.3 episodes per1,000 patient-days. ICU LOS was 21.6 \u00b1 20.6 days. ICU mortalityrate was 17.8% (95% CI = 14.3 to 21.6). In univariable analysis,the APACHE II score, age, admission category, CRRT implemen-tation, PBSI episodes, and packed red blood cell (pRBC) unitstransfused during the ICU LOS were significantly associated withICU mortality. In multivariable analysis, age (OR = 1.2, P = 0.003), APACHE II score (OR = 1.1, P <0.001), infection at admission (OR = 2.9, P = 0.007), CRRT implementation (OR = 9.3, P <0.001), PBSI episodes (OR per episode = 2.7, P = 0.002) and pRBC transfusions (OR = 1.1, P = 0.003) were independently associated with ICU mortality. None of the other BSI types showedassociation with ICU mortality.Conclusions In our patient sample, PBSI episodes during the ICU LOS were independently associated with ICU mortality, each PBSIepisode conferring a 2.7-fold probability of ICU death afteradjustment for potential confounders. The other BSI types (secon-dary, catheter-related) no association with ICU mortality.References1. B, Brun-Buisson C: Outcomes of primary and catheter-related bacteremia.

P190 Reduction of the catheter-related bloodstream infections in critically ill patients R Peredo, C Sabatier, A Villagr\u00e1, D Suarez, Introduction The objective of our study was to determine the utility of a multiple system intervention to reduce catheter-related blood-stream infections (CR-BSI) in an ICU.Methods We carried out a prospective cohort study in a medical and surgical ICU. We determined the rate of CR-BSI per 1,000catheter-days during the application of an evidence-basedintervention used to decrease the CR-BSI in 2007 (March toDecember) compared with the rate during the same period in2006 in which we just applied conventional measures of preven-tion. During the intervention period we applied five measures:giving educational sessions about how to insert and maintaincentral catheters, cleaning the skin with chlorhexidine, filling in achecklist during the insertion of the catheter, using the subclavianvein as the preferred site and avoiding the femoral site if possible,and removing unnecessary catheters. CR-BSI were defined as therecovery of the same organism (same species, same antibioticsusceptibility profile) from the catheter tip and blood cultures.Results During the control and intervention periods we registered 4,289 versus 4,174 patient-days and 3,572 versus 3,296 catheter-days, respectively. During the intervention period eight CR-BSIwere diagnosed compared with 24 CR-BSI in the control period.The mean incidence rate of CR-BSI was 6.7/1,000 catheter-daysin the control period and 2.4/1,000 catheter-days in the inter-vention period (RR = 0.3; 95% CI = 0.1 to 0.7; P = 0.03). A nursing intervention during the filling of the checklist was requiredin 17.7% of the insertions. The ratio of use of the catheter was81.5% during the control period and 80.6% in the interventionperiod without significant differences between periods.Conclusions The implementation of a multiple system intervention with an evidence-based measure significantly reduces the CR-BSIin our ICU. P191 Definition of catheter-related bloodstream infection as a quality improvement measure in intensive care C Meadows, B Creagh-Brown, T Nia, K Bonnici, S Finney Royal Brompton to 20% of hospital-acquired infections in the UKand is associated with both increased ICU stay and mortality.Rates of CRBSI may be modified by clinical care during insertionand utilisation of central venous catheters (CVCs) [1]. As such, theincidence of CRBSI has been proposed as a quality indicator.There is currently no consensus regarding the definition of CRBSI.Methods We applied two internationally recognised guidelines [1,2] to evaluate the CRBSI prevalence in a prospective study ofCVC replacements over 3 months on an adult cardiothoracic ICU.We utilised these criteria for and possible CRBSI. CVC sent for semiquantitative culture, and contemporaneous blood wasdrawn for qualitative culture from both the CVC and a peripheralvein. Possible CRBSI was defined as positive CVC blood cultureand tip in the absence of a peripheral blood culture; colonisedCVC was defined as a positive tip and negative blood culture.Results A total of 33 CVCs were replaced for: clinical suspicion of a CRBSI (64%); duration of use (24%); incidental positive bloodculture (9%); and clinical evidence of catheter site infection (3%).Ninety-one per cent of CVC tips were sent for culture. Fifty-eightper cent of cases had paired blood cultures sent. The incidence ofantimicrobial therapy at the time of blood sampling was 85%. Onlya single CVC replacement (3%) was associated with a confirmedCRBSI. By contrast, the incidence of possible CRBSI was greater(45%).Conclusions Clinical suspicion of CRBSI was associated with infrequent microbiological confirmation. The impact of antibiotictherapy on diagnostic sensitivity is unknown. The incidence ofpossible CRBSI was much greater; we believe this entity encom-passes unknown proportions of both colonised CVCs and CRBSI.The widely used definitions of CRBSI probably therefore under-estimate the true incidence: this limits their utility to describe aparameter that may benchmark different ICUs and drive qualityimprovement processes within an ICU. We propose that both con-firmed and possible CRBSI rates should be recorded as (different)surrogates for the true rate. Finally, this illustrates the shortcomingsof assessing outcomes (CRBSI rate). Measuring adherence toquality control processes (care bundles) may be a bettercomparator.References1.

P192 Comparative study between conventional and antiseptic impregnated central venous catheters S Macedo, J Molina Filho, venous catheters (CVCs) are very useful in the management of patients hospitalized in the ICU, but are notdevoid of complications. Among the complications related to thepermanence of CVCs, infection stands out. This may increase themorbidity, mortality, costs and length of stay in the ICU. Thepurpose of this study was to compare the duration of standardCVCs with those impregnated with antiseptic: silver sulfadiazineand chlorhexidine.Methods A prospective randomized, alternate, nonblind study. Central venous access was taken, alternating the type of CVCused in each patient. Were recorded for each patient the sex, age,APACHE II score, Glasgow coma score, site of the puncture,reason for withdrawal of the catheter and the type of catheterused. The tip of the catheter was cultured (qualitative). The groupswere divided: group I (41 patients, 54 punctures) used the stan-dard CVC, and group II (38 patients, 54 punctures) used animpregnated CVC.Results See Table 1. We included 62 patients (48.38% female). We studied 108 periods of catheterization, of which 54 werestandard CVCs and 54 were impregnated CVCs. The averageAvailable online http://ccforum.com/supplements/13/S1S78length of stay was higher in impregnated CVCs (14.11 days) compared with standard CVCs (10.7 days). Excluding death in both groups, the length of stay of the catheter in group I was 10.86 days, compared with 15.43 days in group II. Adding all periods of catheterization for each group, group I had an amount of 578 days and group II had 762 days. The total duration of group II was 31.84% higher than group I. Regarding the reason for withdrawal of the CVC, the suspected infection predominated in 77.8% of the time in standard CVCs and 49.1% of the time in impregnated CVCs. The culture of the catheter's tip was positive on 10 occasions (18.5%) in standard CVCs, against eight occasions (15.1%) in the impregnated group. Most patients had Glasgow coma score <9. The average APACHE II score was 17.97 in patients of group I, compared with an average of 19.63 in group II patients. The predominant site of puncture in this study was the subclavian vein (56.48%), and the catheters remained a long time on this site when compared with others (jugular and femoral vein). But when we considered only group II (impregnated), the catheters located in the jugular vein remained longer. The impregnated catheter cost 40% more than the conventional. Conclusions The length of stay with the use of impregnated CVCs was higher (15.43 days) than the standard CVC (10.86 days). The rate of colonization was higher in the standard CVC. Patients who require a CVC for long periods have benefited with the use of impregnated CVCs, because they present a long use term, a lower rate of colonization, avoiding complications related to the procedure of successive punctures and related to the permanence of the catheters. In view of the clinical benefits already mentioned, the benefit reached from the use of antiseptic-impregnated catheters compensated the initial expensive cost of 40%. P193 Impact of early catheter removal during treatment of invasive candidiasis: analysis from two phase 3 micafungin trials M Nucci1, R Betts2, B (doi: 10.1186/cc7357) Introduction Prompt central venous is often recommended in candidemic patients [1,2]. To investigatefurther, we evaluated relationships between CVC status and 28- day and 42-day survival post-treatment initiation, overall treatment success, and time to mycological eradication. Methods Data from two randomized, double-blind, phase 3 mica- fungin trials evaluating treatment invasive candidiasis ( n= 842) were analysed. Univariate analysis was performed to evaluate: associations of baseline CVC removal within 24 hours (CVC24) and 48 hours (CVC48) versus non- removal with each treatment outcome; and associations of poten- tial confounding factors with treatment outcomes. A final multi- variate analysis was performed on those associations with P0.10. Results Univariate analysis revealed that CVC24 was associated with survival ( P= 0.05) success ( P= 0.02). Neither CVC24 nor CVC28 were associated with time to mycological eradication. After controlling for confounding variables such as baseline Candida species, APACHE II score, underlying disease, and so on, multivariate analysis revealed that neither CVC24 nor CVC48 were statistically significant prognostic indicators for 28-day and 42-day survival (Figure 1). In addition, CVC48 was not associated with overall treatment success. Conclusions Early CVC removal (within 48 hours of treatment start) had no statistically significant effect on treatment success or survival during treatment of invasive candidiasis. References 1.

The catheter-related coloniza-tion rate iodine inthe group. sepsis or colonization.Conclusions Chlorhexidine is an effective disinfectant agent. The use rather intravascular device and for postinsertion site carecan substantially reduce the incidence of catheter-related infection.References1.

P195 of central-line-related sepsis in neurointensive care patients E Doorley, P Nair Walton Neurological UKCritical (doi: 10.1186/cc7359) Introduction Central venous catheterisation is a core component of intensive care management. Despite advances in medicine,central venous catheters are associated with infection ratesranging between 2.5 and 70% [1,2]. There is, however, littleisolated information regarding rates of central line sepsis inneurointensive patients. Microbiology results from the 3 monthspreceding this study identified six line-related infections. Followingimplementation of a new evidence-based medicine technique forcentral lines, this study set out to review central line sepsis inpatients at Walton Neurological ITU.Methods Eighty-seven patients were identified by the study criteria as suitable for inclusion, of which information on 65 patients wasobtained. Baseline demographical information was collected onpatient sex, age, catheter insertion site and procedural compli-cations. Analysis was then carried out to review the rates of line sepsis in this neurologically compromised group of patients, alongwith identifying any obvious trends in central venous insertion.Results A total of 69.2% ( n= 45) of the cohort of 65 patients had a central line in situ . Of these, 47% ( n= subclavian whilst 6% (n= 4) were unknown (site not mentioned in records). In total, 4.8% ( n= 3) had reported line infections, two of which were coagulase-negative staphylococcus grown from femoral lines whileone patient was reported to have grown Candida albicans from their internal jugular central line site.Conclusions Despite best practice evidence favouring cervical lines, the study found that femoral line insertion was moreappropriate in this subset of patients with unstable head injuries. Inaddition, this study highlighted a 50% reduction in central linesepsis in the 3 months following our central line insertion andmaintenance policies. Furthermore, early resiting on day 3 in thecase of femoral lines resulted in a reduction in contaminatedcentral lines.References1. Jones H: Focus on venous catheter related sepsis.

P196 Central venous catheterization: a randomized comparison between external and internal jugular access F Campos, A Jose Pereira, T Correa, (doi: 10.1186/cc7360) Introduction Central venous catheterization is a routine procedure in intensive care, and internal jugular access (IJA) is often used dueto its high success rates. However, complications can happen inup to 4.2% of internal jugular punctures and it is contraindicated inthe presence of coagulopathy. The external jugular access (EJA) isunderused, has low complications rates and is successful in up to90% of cases. So far, there has been no randomized, controlledtrial comparing both accesses. The objective of this study was todetermine the success and early complication rates of internal andexternal jugular vein access [1].Methods A prospective, randomized study, performed in two adult general ICUs. Inclusion criteria were all patients who need centralvenous catheterization with a visible external jugular vein and nocontraindication for IJA. All included venous catheterizations wereperformed by the first-year and second-year critical care residents,supervised by a staff physician. Admission type, APACHE II scoreand outcomes were recorded.Results Sixty-nine patients were included. The mean APACHE II score was 22.8 (SD = 6.4). Thirty-three patients (47.8%) wererandomized to EJA and 36 (52.2%) to IJA. The percentage ofsuccess was 72.7% with EJA and 88.9% with IJA (risk =0.82; 95% CI = 1.04; P= 0.09). 2/33 1/33 (3%) IJA patients = 2.1; 95% CI = 0.2 to 22.6; P= 0.28). Besides central venous catheterization failure, the only complications were carotidpuncture (one patient in IJA) and external hematoma (two patientsin EJA).Available online http://ccforum.com/supplements/13/S1S80Conclusions External jugular venous access is a good alternative to internal venous catheterization and it is associated with minorand low complications rates. Our results show a lower but notsignificant probability of success with the EJA. Considering thatthe procedure was done by physicians not familiar with thetechnique, however, we did not find definite evidence to indicatethat IJA is superior to EJA.Reference1.

P197 Ultrasound-guided positioning of single-center experience C Chelazzi, C Innocenti, C Pelagatti, AR De used for long-lasting intravenous access. They can beassociated with early and late complications, which are related toan optimal site of insertion and tip positioning [1]. Despitefluoroscopic guidance being the gold standard, ultrasound can bea suitable and easier tool to guide venipuncture and catheterpositioning, provided a postprocedural chest X-ray is taken to ruleout tip malpositioning [2]. Our aim was to assess safety of thistechnique in terms of the best site of insertion, tip position and rateof complications.Methods A total of 360 TIAPs were implanted between December 2007 and September 2008 in a dedicated surgical room at theICU of the University of Florence, Italy. Insertion was performed bytrained intensivists, using an ultrasound-guided technique. A chestX-ray scan was performed after the procedure to rule out acatheter's tip malposition and pneumothorax. Early and latecomplications were noted and recorded. A Fisher test ( P <0.05) was done to test for association between the site of insertion andeither tip position or occurrence of complications.Results From a total of 360 TIAPs implanted, the rate of malposition was seven catheters (1.9%). The site of insertion thatconsented the best rate of correct placement was the right internaljugular vein ( P <0.05). The incidence of complications was 17 out of 360 procedures (4.7%). Early complications included fivearterial punctures and one pneumothorax, while late complicationsincluded four TIAP displacements, one pocket infection, threecatheter-related infections and three thromboses. A correlationwas found between occurrence of late complications and leftinsertion sites P <0.05). Conclusions Ultrasound-guided venipuncture for TIAP implan- tation was safely conducted in the majority of patients. The rightinternal jugular vein was the best insertion site in terms of the bestrate of correct catheter tip position and lower incidence ofcomplications.References1.

However, there arefew data on the potential advantages of the use of US guidance forsubclavian vein (SV) catheterization. The aim of this study was toevaluate whether US-guided catheterization of SV improves theprocedural success rate of the traditional landmark method in ICUpatients.Methods Ethics Committee approval and written informed consent from all patients or their next of kin were obtained. We prospec-tively and randomly evaluated an US-guided method in 35 patientsundergoing SV catheterization (Group US) and compared theresults with 35 patients in whom a landmark-guided technique wasused (Group LM). All procedures were performed by the samephysician, who was experienced in both techniques. The catheteri-zation success rate at the first attempt, the overall catheterizationsuccess rate, the number of attempts, the time to catheterization,and catheterization-related mechanical complications wererecorded. Bedside chest X-ray scans were used to evaluate theposition of the catheter tip, pneumothorax, and hemothorax.Results The groups were similar in terms of physical characteristics, systemic disease, and risk factors for difficult SVcatheterization. Catheterization success rate at the first attempt(Group LM 63% and Group US 63%, P = 1.00) and overall success rate (Group LM 94% and Group US 89%, P = 0.67) were similar in both groups. The number of attempts for SVcatheterization were no different in the groups (Group LM 1.6 \u00b11.0 attempts and Group US 1.7 \u00b1 1.1 attempts, P = 0.61). Three patients in Group LM developed six mechanical complicationswhile four patients in Group US had four such complications(P>0.05 for all). The time to catheterization was significantly longer in Group US than Group LM (Group LM 178 \u00b1 128 s vs.Group US 230 \u00b1 127 s, P = 0.008). Conclusions Compared with the landmark technique, real-time two-dimensional US did not increase the overall or first attemptsuccess rate in subclavian vein catheterization in ICU patients. Thetime to catheterization was significantly longer with real-time two-dimensional US guidance than with landmark guidance. P199 Perioperative fluid administration in pancreatic surgery: comparison of three regimens A Martini, N Menestrina, L Filetici, fluid administration represents an important issue in perioperative medicine, because an incorrectstrategy is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Theaim of this study was to compare three fluid administrationregimens in patients who have undergone pancreatic surgery.Methods A randomized prospective trial. Fifty-nine patients, American Society of Anesthesiologists class 1 to 3, were assignedto one of three perioperative fluid regimens (PFRs). Interventions:Critical Care March 2009 Vol 13 Suppl 1 29th International Symposium on Intensive Care and Emergency MedicineS81general balanced anesthesia; PFR1, liberal (21 patients): colloids restricted (18 patients): ml/kg/hour; and PFR3, goal targeted (20 targeted achieve volumevariation (SVV) <13%. Hemodynamic monitoring was performedusing the Vigileo/FloTrac system (cardiac output (CO) and SVV).Recorded outcome variables were hospital length of stay, startingof enteral nutrition, bowel movement, blood transfusion, andperioperative complications.Results Data regarding significant differences are presented in Table 1. Hemodynamic monitoring showed a higher variability ofCO and SVV Postoperative major complications werealso PFR1. Fistulas occurred in eight cases of PFR1 andin three and four cases in PFR2 and PFR3, respectively ( P <0.05). Conclusions Our study in still ongoing; however, ad interim analysis suggests that a restricted or goal-targeted perioperativefluid administration seems to provide more stable hemodynamicsand a reduction of major abdominal complications. P200 B-type natriuretic peptide, corrected flow time and central venous pressure as predictors of fluid responsiveness in septic shock D Sturgess1, R Pascoe2, G Scalia2, B Venkatesh1 B-type natriuretic peptide concentration (BNP) appears not to predict fluid responsiveness in septic shockbut no account has been made for the potential influence ofcardiac rhythm [1]. Also, no comparison has been made betweenBNP and other clinical guides to fluid therapy, such as the Doppleraortic flow time corrected for heart rate (FTc) or central venouspressure (CVP). The aim of this preliminary study was to compareBNP, FTc and CVP as predictors of fluid responsiveness in septicshock patients without cardiac dysrhythmia.Methods A prospective study of 10 consecutive adult septic shock patients (in sinus rhythm; 60% mechanically ventilated)treated with intravenous fluid challenge (4% albumin 250 ml over15 min) in an Australian tertiary ICU. Results presented as themean \u00b1 SD.Results The APACHE II score was ent incorporating transcutaneous aortic Doppler (USCOM occurred before and 5 minutes after fluid challenge. Concurrentwith the initial assessment, blood samples were collected for BNPassay (ADIVA Centaur \u00ae). Four patients demonstrated an increase in stroke volume 15% (responders). Three of the responders hadan elevated baseline BNP (>144 pg/ml). The percentage change in stroke volume correlated with baseline FTc ( r= Conclusions Our data confirm that neither BNP nor CVP appear to predict fluid responsiveness. Furthermore, elevated BNP shouldnot be viewed as a contraindication to fluid challenge in septicshock, as it does not exclude favourable haemodynamic response.Transcutaneous FTc offers promise as a predictor of fluidresponsiveness and should be evaluated further.Reference1.

P201 Intraoperative fluid optimization using stroke volume variation in high-risk surgical patients: preliminary results of a randomized prospective single-center study J Bene, I Chytra, 10.1186/cc7365) Introduction Stroke volume variation (SVV) is a good and easily obtained predictor of fluid responsiveness that can be used toguide fluid therapy in mechanically ventilated patients. During majorabdominal surgery in patients with compromised cardiovascularreserves, inappropriate fluid management may result in occultorgan hypoperfusion or in fluid overload and increasedpostoperative morbidity. The aim of our study was to evaluate theinfluence of SVV-guided fluid optimization on organ functions andpostoperative morbidity and mortality in high-risk patientsundergoing major abdominal surgery.Methods Patients undergoing elective intraabdominal vascular and nonvascular surgery were randomly assigned to a control groupwith routine intraoperative care and a SVV group with fluidmanagement guided by SVV derived from the Vigileo/FloTracsystem. The intervention target was to maintain the SVV with colloid boluses of 3 ml/kg. was the same for both groups. Demographic parameters,comorbidities, performed surgical procedures, mortality and ICUand hospital lengths of stay were assessed. Laboratory parametersof organ hypoperfusion in the perioperative period (pH, baseexcess, serum lactate) and number of infectious and organcomplications on day 7 and day 30 after operation were evaluated.The Mann-Whitney, unpaired t test and chi-squared test were used accordingly; P <0.05 was considered statistically significant. The study was approved by the local hospital ethic committee.Results A total of 80 patients were enrolled and randomized in the SVV ( n= 40) and control ( n= 40) groups. No significant differences between both groups in assessed parameters werefound except for a difference in arterial pH (7.37 \u00b1 0.05 vs. 7.35 \u00b10.05; P = 0.04), lactate serum concentration at the end of the operation (median (IQR): 1.5 (1.2 to 1.9) mmol/l vs. 2.2 (1.39 to2.35) mmol/l; P= 0.03) and the trend to lower rate of complications on day 30 in the SVV group (11 patients (39%) vs.20 patients (57%); P = 0.06). Conclusions Fluid optimization guided by SVV during major abdominal surgery decreases blood lactate at the end of operationand may be associated with a trend for a lower rate of post-operative organ complications.Acknowledgement Supported by the research grant MSM0021620819.Available online http://ccforum.com/supplements/13/S1 Table 1 (abstract P199) Main results Liberal, Goal, Restricted, PFR1 PFR3 PFR2 Age (years) 60 55 60 Surgery duration (hours) 6 6 5.5Colloids (ml) 1,000 500 1,100Crystalloids (ml) 4,600 2,200 1,450Enteral nutrition (days from surgery) 4 4 3Bowel movement (days from surgery) 3 4 3Hospital length of stay (days) 11.5 11.5 9S82P202 Impedance cardiography in the estimation of hemodynamic and fluid status of coma patients during continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration A De Nicola, MJ Sucre San 13(Suppl 1): (CVVHDF) are in Impedance cardiography (ICG) techno-logy provides a measurement of fluid status using the thoracic fluidcontent (TFC), along with cardiac output (CO), cardiac systemic vascular resistance index (SVRI). NICCOMO noninvasive ICG device that provides trust-worthy measures, could be a complementary monitor for CVVHDF,supporting fluid balance and helping avoid hemodynamic instability[2].Methods The study was an analysis of coma patients with acute renal failure while undergoing CVVHDF (Equasmart \u00ae; Hemodec, Italy). By means of NICCOMO\u00aethe TFC, CI, CO, mean arterial pressure and SVRI were constantly recorded. Employing thePearson method, the percentage variations in each of the para-meters during the CVVHDF treatment were correlated to theamount of fluid removed (FR), normalized to body weight.Results Ten patients were studied (six men and four women); the age range was 53.1 \u00b1 15.2 years. A total of 16.6 l of fluid wasremoved during CVVHDF (830 ml/day over 20 treatment days).The median FR per day was 1,837 ml and the median hourly FRrate was 252 ml. TFC diminished in all patients at the end ofCVVHDF treatment (average reduction 14.8 \u00b1 9/k ), while all other hemodynamic parameters showed both increases anddecreases. We found that the percentage TFC changes wereclosely and inversely related with those of FR ( r= -0.68, P<0.001); other hemodynamic parameters showed a moderate correlation with FR. The ICG device was helpful to promptlyidentify one patient who experienced hemodynamic instability andto prevent it.Conclusions TFC is a reliable and noninvasive method for evaluating the quantity of FR during CVVHDF. This parameterchanged consistently with fluid subtraction and TFCmeasurements can guide the extent of FR. This compact ICGdevice provides safe and accurate readings and seems to be oneof the best options for evaluation of basic hemodynamicparameters and TFC during hemodiafiltration.References1.

P203 Pulse and systolic pressure variation assessment in partially assisted ventilatory support P Formenti, M Zaniboni, M Umbrello, A Galimberti, Pinciroli, G P203 10.1186/cc7367) The use of pulse pressure variation (PPV) and systolic pressure variation (SPV) is possible during controlledmechanical ventilation (MV) [1]. Even in acute respiratory failure,controlled MV tends to be replaced by assisted ventilatory support,which may generate a tidal volume (Tv) inadequate to change thepulmonary venous flow and swing in pleural pressure [2]. Thismakes the use of dynamic indices unreliable. Our hypothesis was that during a pressure-support-assisted ventilatory (PSV) approachfew imposed breaths (flow-triggered synchronized could allow the monitoring of PPVand SPV. We therefore tested whether PPV and SPV during PSV+ SIMV could be as accurate as in controlled MV.Methods A prospective case-control study. Thirty patients who met the criteria of weaning from controlled MV were included. PPVand SPV were measured, first, during 20 minutes in PSV with threeper minute flow-triggered SIMV breaths (10 ml/kg, duration 5 s,inspiration to expiration ratio 1:3) (T1), and then during threeconsecutive breaths in controlled MV (respiratory rate 12/min,duration 5 s, inspiration to expiration ratio 1:3, Tv 10 ml/kg, positiveend-expiratory pressure and FiO 2as in (T2). Throughout of data collection, saline infusions were kept constant(3 ml/hour) without performing any fluid loading. Correlation andBland-Altman analysis were used to compare respective values ofPPV and SPV in the two modes of ventilation.Results Significant correlations were found between dynamic indices in SIMV during pressure support ventilation and those incontrolled MV mode. The mean differences between twomeasurements were: PPV and SPV measured during SIMV fitted with the findings in controlled MV. Dynamic indexes could be accuratelymonitored in patients breathing with assisted respiratoryassistance adding an imposed large enough SIMV breath [3].References1.

P204 Does the pleth variability index improve fluid management during major abdominal surgery? P Forget, F Lois, M De Kock St-Luc 10.1186/cc7368) Introduction Dynamic parameters predict fluid responsiveness and improve fluid management during surgery. We intend todemonstrate that the noninvasive pleth variability index (PVI) guidesperoperative fluid management and optimizes the circulatorystatus.Methods Patients scheduled for major abdominal surgery were randomized into two groups comparing the peroperative PVI-directed fluid management (group P) versus standard care(control, group C). Protocol: induction of general anesthesia wasfollowed by, in group P, 500 ml followed by 2 ml/kg/hourcrystalloids; 250 ml colloids infused if PVI >13% for more vasoactive support was introduced afterlowering PVI <10%. In group C, 500 ml crystalloids followed byfluids at the discretion of the anesthesiologist.Results Eighty-two patients completed the protocol. No difference was detected in preoperative characteristics, type of surgery andanesthesia. Peroperative and postoperative (24-hour) crystalloidinfusions were significantly different. Lactate levels wereCritical Care March 2009 Vol 13 Suppl 1 29th International Symposium on Intensive Care and Emergency MedicineS83significantly lower in group P, whereas the peroperative and post- operative volumes infused in group P were lower (Figure 1). Conclusions The PVI improves peroperative fluid management in abdominal surgery. The reduced mean volume infused associated with reduced lactate levels suggests the capacity of the PVI to infer tailored fluid administration. P205 Plethysmography variability index: a new fluid P205 (doi: 10.1186/cc7369) Introduction New predictors of fluid responsiveness have been obtained from plethysmographic waveforms displayed on pulse oxymeters. However, they require recordings on a PC and offline operator-dependent analysis. A new parameter called the plethysmography variability index (PVI) has been proposed by a pulse oxymetry manufacturer to be used for the purpose of fluid responsiveness. Its advantage is that it can be automatically calculated and displayed on the screen of the pulse oxymetry monitor. The aim of the study is to test the accuracy of this parameter to predict fluid responsiveness in critically ill patients. Methods Inclusion criteria were septic shock patients fully adapted to their respirator and on sinus rhythm. Methods involved simultaneous recording of the following tracings: invasive blood pressure, plethysmography pulse oxymeter (Philips), ECG, airway pressure and digit values inscribed on the device (Masimo). Echocardiography was used to calculate the velocity-time integral (VTI). We infused fluid (500 ml saline) in patients with pulse pressure variation ( PP) 15% and performed passive leg raising (PLR) in patients with PP <15%. We compared the PVI with PP and variability of pulse oxymeter wave amplitude ( PPleth) and sought the best threshold PVI value that predicted PP >15%. Patients who increased their VTI by more than 15% in response to fluid or to PLR were defined as responders. The significance of the PVI threshold to distinguish between responders and nonresponders was examined. Results In the first step 25 patients were enrolled. Fifty paired values were analysed. The r2coefficients between PP-PVI, PPleth-PVI and and 0.74, respectively. A threshold PVI value of 20 identified patients with PP >15% with a sensitivity of 84% and specificity of 90%. In a second step 18 other patients were enrolled. All patients with PVI >20 ( n= 8) were fluid responders and with PVI <20 were PLR nonresponders.Conclusions The PVI automatically obtained from a pulse oxymetry device seems an accurate index of fluid responsiveness. The numerical value of 20 distinguished responders from non- responders with good sensitivity and specificity.

Methods Eleven patients were investigated for over 10 hours using two COpc monitors simultaneously. One COpc (COpcCAL) monitor was calibrated hourly, while the other (COpcNOCAL) was calibrated once initially without any further calibration. COpcCAL was compared with COpcNOCAL. Results A total of 116 pairs of cardiac output measurement was obtained. After 3 hours, the correlation between COpcCAL and COpcNOCAL was r2= was -0.81 \u00b1 ml/minute. See Figures 1 and 2. Conclusions The calibration interval has no effect on the reliability of the COpc measurement. Reference 1.

P207 Is the pulse pressure variation a good predictor of fluid responsiveness in mechanically ventilated patients with low tidal volume? C Costa, S Vieira, G Friedman, L Fialkow Hospital de Clinicas de Porto (doi: 10.1186/cc7371) Introduction Dynamic preload indicators are superior to static indicators for predicting fluid responsiveness [1-3]. The aim of this study is to evaluate the influence of a low tidal volume on the capacity of pulse pressure variation (PPV) to predict fluid responsiveness. Methods A transversal and interventional study that included 30 critically ill patients with acute circulatory failure, sedated and mechanically ventilated with a tidal volume of 6 to 7 ml/kg. Mechanical ventilatory measurements including positive end- expiratory pressure plateau and peak pressures, static compliance and hemodynamic measurements including PPV, heart rate, mean systemic and pulmonary arterial pressures, central venous pressure, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and cardiac index were obtained before and after fluid challenge, performed with 1,000 ml crystalloids or 500 ml colloids. Fluid responsiveness was defined as an increase in cardiac index of at least 15%. Results Thirty patients were enrolled: aged 56 \u00b1 16.8 years, APACHE score = 28 \u00b1 8, male = 15; 19 patients with septic shock, one patient with sepsis, five patients in postoperative liver transplantation, three patients with acute pancreatitis, one patient with cardiogenic shock and one patient in postoperative aorticAvailable online http://ccforum.com/supplements/13/S1 Figure 1 (abstract P204) S84aneurysm. Before fluid challenge: total positive end-expiratory pressure = 09 \u00b1 3.7 cmH2O, static compliance = 34.3 \u00b1 16.3 cmH2O, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure = 13.8 \u00b1 5 mmHg, central venous pressure = 11.6 \u00b1 5 mmHg. Fourteen patients were fluid responders (Figure 1). The best threshold value of PPV was 10% (receiver operating characteristic curve area = 0.7, 95% CI = 0.51 to 0.9), sensibility of 50%, specificity of 94%, apositive predictive value of 88%, a negative predictive value of 68%, a positive likelihood ratio of 8.0 and a negative likelihood ratio of 0.53. Conclusions The baseline PPV is a good predictor of fluid responsiveness in mechanically ventilated patients with low tidal volume. The threshold value of 10% was associated with a significant increase in cardiac index after volume expansion.Critical Care March 2009 Vol 13 Suppl 1 29th International Symposium on Intensive Care and Emergency Medicine Figure 2 (abstract P206) Bland-Altman plot of COpcCAL and COpcNOCAL.

P208 Proving the effectiveness of three dynamic indices to predict fluid responsiveness in septic mechanically ventilated patients P Wacharasint, A Lertamornpong, A Wathanathum, A Wongsa Phramongkutklao 2009, 13(Suppl 1): P208 (doi: 10.1186/cc7372) Introduction Fluid responsiveness is still a cornerstone in managing patients with severe sepsis and septic shock. Recently new technologies have been generated for facilitating the accuracy of predicting fluid responsiveness at the bedside, based on cardiopulmonary interaction [1,2]. We evaluated the effectiveness and accuracy of three dynamic indices, currently available in intensive care monitoring devices, which are pulse pressure variation (PPV) [3], stroke volume variation (SVV) and pulse oximetry plethysmographic waveform variation (POPV) in septic mechanically ventilated patients [4]. Methods A prospective clinical trial was conducted in 20 septic patients 18 years of age and older who had invasive blood pressure monitoring with an intraarterial cannula. PPV, SVV and POPV (%) were calculated and compared with the percentage cardiac index (CI) change. Patients with a CI increase induced by volume expansion >15% were classified as responders, and <15% as nonresponders. A parametric paired ttest was used to compare hemodynamic parameters at baseline and after volume expansion. Student's ttest was used to compare hemodynamic parameters in the responders and nonresponders groups. Receiver operating characteristic curves were used to evaluate thepredictive value of various indices on fluid responsiveness. P<0.05 was considered significant. Results We found a strong correlation existed for PPV for detection of a volume expansion-induced change in 0.633). PPV exceeding 12% (sensitivity 84%, specificity 96%). Conclusions In the septic mechanically ventilated patients, PPV is the most effective dynamic parameter for predicting fluid responsiveness; all of PPV, SVV and POPV are well correlated with the percentage change of CI.

CO was measured simultaneously by FloTrac, LiDCO and PiCCO using the same arterial waveform. LiDCO and PiCCO were calibrated to the first COtd measured on ICU admission. Values of CO were compared before and after specific therapeutic interventions (volume, vasoactive or inotropic infusions). Absolute values for CO across all devices were compared by linear regression and Bland-Altman analysis. Dynamic changes for CO across all devices were compared by moment analysis. Results In 17 patients, 72 paired simultaneous CO measurements were collected. By linear regression analysis, all devices correlated well with each other for absolute CO P<0.001 in all pairs. By Bland-Altman analysis, the mean bias between CO measurements by each paired device P207) Relationship between the PPV and cardiac \u00b13.45 l/min, respectively. By Pearson moment analysis, the dynamic change for CO was well correlated between PAC-LiDCO, PAC-PiCCO, 0.55, respectively). However, FloTrac showed poor correlation with PAC and PiCCO (r= 0.28 and 0.33, respectively). Conclusions In postoperative cardiac surgery patients, the absolute CO of arterial pulse analysis devices showed good correlation with each other and PAC COtd and CCO. However, the dynamic change of CO was less correlated with each other than the absolute CO. Because each arterial pulse analysis device showed different correlations with PAC CO, the CO data from one monitoring system can be used carefully in concert with another to drive resuscitation protocols. P210 Comparison of three noninvasive cardiac output monitors in patients undergoing therapeutic hypothermia after cardiac arrest GM Haslam, FE Kelly, WA English, A D'Agapeyeff, AJ Padkin, TM Cook, JP Nolan Royal United Hospital, Bath, UK Critical Care 2009, 13(Suppl 1): P210 (doi: 10.1186/cc7374) Introduction We planned to observe performance of the LiDCOplus (LiDCO Systems, UK), PiCCO (Pulsion Medical Systems, Germany) and NICO (Novametrix-Respironics, USA) continuous cardiac output monitors during therapeutic hypo- thermia and rewarming post cardiac arrest. PiCCO calibration failure during hypothermia has been reported [1,2]. Use of the LiDCOplus and the NICO monitor during therapeutic hypothermia has not been reported. The LiDCOplus pulse power analysis is calibrated using a bolus of lithium chloride instead oftranspul monary thermodilution. Function of the NICO is based on the Fick principle and on partial rebreathing of carbon dioxide. LiDCOplus and NICO performance should not be affected by hypothermia. Methods Local research ethics committee approval was obtained. Patients admitted to our ICU for therapeutic hypothermia after cardiac arrest were recruited to the study following assent from the next of kin. Hypothermia was induced with 2 l crystalloid at 4\u00b0C and maintained using an Alsius Coolguard Icy Catheter (Alsius Corp., USA) inserted via the femoral vein. A 5 F PiCCO catheter was inserted in the femoral artery on the opposite side and connected to the PiCCO and LiDCOplus monitors. A NICO system was attached to the patient's tracheal tube. Systems were calibrated and recalibrated according to the manufacturer's instructions (PiCCO 8 hourly, LIDCOplus 24 hourly). The bladder temperature was recorded and maintained at 33\u00b0C for 24 hours. The temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, and cardiac output on all three monitors were recorded hourly. After 24 hours, patients were rewarmed at 0.25\u00b0C/hour to a target of 36.5\u00b0C. Results Six patients were recruited over 8 months. All patients were at the target temperature of 33\u00b0C when cardiac output was first recorded. No problems were encountered calibrating the PiCCO, LiDCOplus or NICO monitors at temperatures as low as 33\u00b0C. All three monitors were observed to trend together (Figure 1). Statistical analysis of these trends will be available at the time of presentation. Conclusions LiDCOplus, PiCCO and NICO perform comparably in the temperature range of 33 to 36.5\u00b0C.

P211 Head-up tilt and passive leg raising in healthy volunteers as a preclinical model for preload-induced stroke volume modification A Lima, E Klijn, J Bakker, C Ince, J Van Bommel Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam, the Netherlands Critical Care 2009, 13(Suppl 1): P211 (doi: 10.1186/cc7375) Introduction In clinical practice, fluid responsiveness is tested by inducing changes in the stroke volume (SV), as measured with invasive monitoring techniques in often time-consuming proce- dures. To be able to investigate the effects of changes in SV on other hemodynamic parameters, there is the need for a preclinical model that can be translated to clinical practice. For this purpose we studied the effect of the head-up tilt (HUT) test and passive leg raising (PLR) test on SV in five healthy volunteers. Methods The tilt table test consisted of 3 minutes of supine rest followed by a HUT of 70\u00b0 on a manually operated tilt table and ending with 3 minutes of supine rest. The PLR test consisted of 3 minutes of rest in a semirecumbent position of 30\u00b0, followed by 3 minutes PLR (lower limbs elevated at 30\u00b0 and trunk in supine position) and ending with 3 minutes of rest in a semirecumbent position. Three HUTs and two PLR tests were performed. The SV was measured continuously and noninvasively using a NICOM (Cheetah Medical, Tel Aviv, Israel), based on chest bioreactance, and a Finometer (TNO Biomedical Instrumentation, Amsterdam, the Netherlands), based on the Modelflow method. The Finometer also measured the mean arterial pressure.Critical Care March 2009 Vol 13 Suppl 1 29th International Symposium on Intensive Care and Emergency Medicine Figure 1 (abstract P210) S87Results Both HUT and PLR induced significant changes in SV (Figure 1). In addition the cardiac output changed significantly, but not during HUT when measured with the Finometer. Although both devices showed a similar response to the postural changes, the baseline values and magnitude of these responses were not identical. The mean arterial pressure remained constant during these manoeuvres. The heart rate significantly increased during HUT but not during PLR. Conclusions The combination of noninvasive monitoring tech- niques with preload-induced SV modifications in healthy volunteers provides an excellent preclinical model for the study of fluid responsiveness. Although these hemodynamic monitors might provide different results, this model should be very suitable to assess the effect of SV variations on, for instance, parameters of peripheral perfusion. P212 Global end-diastolic volume as a predictor of the need for massive transfusion in multiple-trauma patients with hemorrhagic shock N Saito, Y Sakamoto, K Mashiko Chiba Hokusou Hospital, Nippon 13(Suppl 1): P212 (doi: 10.1186/cc7376) Introduction The PiCCO system enables evaluation and monitoring by two different approaches: the transpulmonary thermal dilution technique and pulse counter analysis. Optimal monitoring of cardiac preload is of paramount importance for the hemodynamic management of multiple-trauma patients with hemorrhagic shock. There have been only a few studies on the use of the PiCCO system (Pulsion, Germany) in multiple-trauma patients with hemorrhagic shock for hemodynamic monitoring. We hypothesized that performing a cardiac adequate preload evaluation with the PiCCO system would make it possible to predict latent hemorrhagic progress. Methods Data from 53 consecutive multiple-trauma patients (age 51 \u00b1 17.8 years, injury severity score 30 \u00b1 12.9) with hemorrhagic shock at the scene of the injury or in the emergency room between June 2007 and November 2008 were analyzed. All patients underwent a hemodynamic evaluation with the PiCCO system. We divided the patients into two groups according to whether they received a massive transfusion (MT) (>2,000 ml packed red blood cell transfusion after admission within 24 hours) and compared their PiCCO data: cardiac output (CO), systemic vascular resis- global end-diastolic volume (GEDVi), and indexed extravascular lung water on admission to the ICU. The chi- square test and paired ttest were used to perform the statistical analysis.Results Twenty-seven patients required massive transfusion. Mortality was higher in the MT group ( P = 0.05), and the CO, GEDVi and ITBVi values were significantly lower in the MT group (Table 1). Conclusions The parameters measured with the PiCCO system enabled evaluation of the correct cardiac preload in the multiple- trauma patients with hemorrhagic shock. GEDVi was useful as a predictor of the need for MT. P213 Should pulse pressure variation be indexed to tidal volume? S Vistisen, J Koefoed-Nielsen, A Larsson Aalborg Hospital/Aarhus 1): P213 (doi: 10.1186/cc7377) Introduction Pulse pressure variation (PPV) for prediction of fluid responsiveness depends on the tidal volume (VT), and using VTs of the recommended 6 ml/kg makes PPV unreliable [1]. So far, nobody has suggested how to handle the VT when interpreting PPV or other dynamic parameters, but we hypothesise that PPV is proportional to VT and thus that PPV should be indexed to VT. The aim was to investigate how three VT levels affected PPV at four different intravascular volumes. Methods The study was approved by the national animal ethical committee. Eight anesthetised and ventilated pigs (23 to 27 kg) were bled 25% of the blood volume (hypovolemia). PPV was measured at ventilation with VTs of 6, 9 and 12 ml/kg (VT6, VT9 and VT12, respectively). Thereafter, depleted blood was replaced with voluven (normovolemia) and PPV was again measured at the three VT levels and subsequently at the +25% and +50% hypervolemic levels also generated with voluven infusion. PPV values were log-transformed and compared with a paired t test. Comparisons were made at each intravascular volume level between VT6 and VT9, VT9 and VT12, and VT6 and VT12. Because three comparisons were performed, P<0.05/3 = 0.017 was considered significant. Results All comparisons for PPV at different VTs were significantly different ( P <0.001); see Table 1 for factorial increases in PPV. At -25% hypovolemia, PPV did not fully double with doubling of VT, whereas PPV slightly more than doubled at normovolemia and hypervolemia.Available online http://ccforum.com/supplements/13/S1 Figure 1 (abstract P211) Table 1 (abstract P212) MT group Non-MT group P213) of 0% 1.53 to 2.00 1.24 to 1.60 2.17 to 2.80 +25% 1.47 to 1.87 1.26 to 1.50 1.88 to 2.77 +50% 1.50 to 1.71 1.30 to 1.61 2.09 to 2.56 Data presented as the 95% CI.S88Conclusions Our study in pigs showed that PPV strongly depends on the VT and that PPV is nearly proportional to the VT, indicating that the clinical value of PPV may be improved by TV indexation.

P214 Fluid responsiveness in patients following major surgery M Tuccillo1, M Cecconi2, N Al-Subaie2, M 1): P214 (doi: 10.1186/cc7378) Introduction The aim of the study was to see how many patients were fluid responders on arrival in the ICU and to evaluate the performance of dynamic preload indices in predicting fluid responsiveness in fully sedated and mechanically ventilated patients. The following indices were studied: pulse pressure variation (PPV), stroke volume variation (SVV) and systolic pressure variation (SPV). Methods Patients were monitored with the LiDCOTMplus and received a fluid challenge (250 ml boluses of colloid in 5 min) to ascertain fluid responsiveness. Patients in which a fluid challenge produced a 10% increase in stroke volume were considered fluid responders and thus the fluid challenge was repeated according to the unit protocol [1]. In fully mechanically ventilated patients, the PPV, SVV and SPV were recorded and receiver operating charac- teristic (ROC) analysis was performed. Results Thirty-three patients (mean age 64 years; SD \u00b1 13.80; mean BMI 27.34; 16 female and 17 male) were included; 23 patients were on spontaneous ventilation and 10 were totally fully ventilated with a mean tidal volume of 8 ml/kg and positive end- expiratory pressure of 5 cmH2O. Thirteen patients (40%) were responders, of which five were mechanically ventilated. Areas under the ROC curve (AUC) for dynamic predictors of fluid responsiveness were examined for ventilated patients; for PPV, AUC = 0.65 with SD \u00b1 0.14, P= 0.28 showing a sensitivity of 67% and a specificity of 79% for a cutoff value of 14%; for SVV, AUC = 0.73 with SD \u00b1 0.14, P= 0.1 showing a sensitivity of 67% and a specificity of 74% for a cutoff value of 9%; and for SPV, AUC = 0.74 with SD \u00b1 0.12, P= 0.09 showing a sensitivity of 67% and a specificity of 86% for a cutoff value of 8%. Conclusions A high percentage of patients were fluid responsive on arrival in the ICU following major surgery (40%). The PPV, SVV and SPV have a potential to predict fluid responsiveness in mechanically ventilated patients. Reference 1.

P215 Alternative echographic assessment of inferior vena cava diameter variation in mechanically ventilated patients T Leclerc1, N Libert1, JP Tourtier1, (IVC) diameter (IVCD) variation allows for fluid-responsivenessprediction in ventilated septic patients [1,2]. Its applicability in surgical patients is not established, partly due to the difficulty to acquire a subxiphoidian (SX) view after abdominal surgery. The transhepatic (TH) view of the IVC could provide an interesting alternative. Methods In this prospective, randomized, crossover, pilot study, IVCD variation was assessed in consecutive mechanically ventilated (volume control) ICU patients, with SX and TH views, in random order by one operator. M-mode images were acquired at 100 mm/s, 2 cm below the junction of the IVC with the right atrium. The minimal (Dmin) and maximal (Dmax) ICVD values were later measured on pooled images. IVCD variation [2], defined as dIVC = (Dmax - Dmin) / ((Dmax + Dmin) / 2), was compared between both views (when available): dIVCsx and dIVCth for subxiphoidian and transhepatic views, respectively. Results Twenty-eight patients were included, 19 medical and nine surgical. The TH view was obtained in all patients, the SX view in only 22 of them with failures in four surgical and two morbidly obese medical patients. Linear regression showed a strong using Bland-Altman analysis (Figure 1): bias was 0.26%, limits of agreement were -8.4 to +7.9%. Results were similar for the IVC distensibility index [1]. Conclusions Our results suggest that the SX view, when unavailable, can be replaced by the TH view for the echographic assessment of IVCD variation. Further study is ongoing to formally establish its validity as a predictor of fluid responsiveness, especially in surgical ICU patients. References 1.

P216 Global end-diastolic volume and global end-diastolic volume index are age dependent in awake, spontaneous- breathing patients after elective craniotomy A Rie\u00df, S 10.1186/cc7380) Introduction Estimation of cardiac preload is an important pre- requisite for adequate volume resuscitation. The global end- diastolic volume (GEDV) and the global end-diastolic volume index (GEDVI) are surrogate parameters for preload and have been hypothesized to be age dependent [1]. The current study was performed to assess the influence of age on the preload parameters GEDV and GEDVI prospectively.Critical Care March 2009 Vol 13 Suppl 1 29th International Symposium on Intensive Care and Emergency Medicine Figure 1 (abstract P215) S89Methods One hundred and one patients (41 male, 60 female) scheduled for brain tumour surgery were investigated using thePiCCOplus device (Pulsion Medical Systems AG, Munich,Germany). On postoperative day 1, the cardiac output, GEDV andGEDVI were determined by transpulmonary thermodilution beforedischarge from the ICU. The influence of predefined age groups(21 to 40 years old, n= 12; 41 to 50 years old, n= 24; 51 to 60 years old, n= 20; 61 to 70 years old, n= 26; 71 to 83 years old, n= 19) was tested using a Kruskal-Wallis test. The level of significance was 5%.Results Age significantly influenced the GEDV ( Conclusions The volumetric parameter GEDV is dependent on age in haemodynamically healthy and spontaneously breathingpatients. Indexing to body surface area does not remove agedependence. Targeting volume resuscitation using fixed ranges ofthe GEDVI acquired by transpulmonary thermodilution withoutreference to the patient's age seems not to be appropriate.Reference1.

P217 of pulse contour cardiac output using the PiCCO-2 device: when to perform the next thermodilution? W Huber, S Mair, T Oelfin, B Saugel, V Phillip, H is a cornerstone of inten- sive care. In addition to parameters of preload and afterload, theassessment of cardiac output (CO) is of paramount importance.Thermodilution (TD) using the pulmonary artery catheter andtranspulmonary TD using the PiCCO device are the gold standardsfor CO determination. After calibration by TD, the PiCCO device isable to assess CO using pulse contour (PC) analysis. Despite anoverall good correlation of PC-CO and TD-CO in several studies,the manufacturer suggests recalibration by TD after 8 hours. Littleis known about the long-term accuracy of PC-CO. Therefore it wasthe aim of our prospective study to investigate the long-termaccuracy of PiCCO-2-derived PC-CO in the daily ICU routine.Methods In 10 consecutive patients (five male, five female, age 65 \u00b1 15 years) the PC-CO was recorded immediately beforerecalibration by TD-CO. One hundred and ninety-four measure-ments with a time-lag between two measurements of TD-COof 663.5 \u00b1 371 min (100 to 2,700) were catecholamine and arrhythmia occurred in 60 (31%),132 (68%) and 154 (79%) of the measurements.Results The 194 pairs of PC-CO and TD-CO showed a highly significant correlation ( P<0.001; r= 0.875). There was no signifi- TD-CO (4.1 \u00b1 1.6 vs.4.07 \u00b1 1.4 l/min m 2). Analysis according to Bland-Altman a mean bias of -0.036 \u00b1 0.778 l/min m2(lower and upper limits of and 1.49 l/min m2; percentage error of 38%). The difference of PC-CO and TD-CO was notcorrelated values of the difference). Further analysis demonstratedthat the absolute value of the differences correlated to TD-CO(P= 0.02, r= 0.226). Subgroup analysis of 160 measurements with CO-TD <5.5 l/min m 2demonstrated an improved m2(lower/upper limits of agreement: -0.98 and 1.12 l/min m2) and a percentage error of 28%. Conclusions PiCCO-2-derived PC-CO and TD-CO are highly significantly correlated. Accuracy is not influenced by the time-lagto the last calibration. Similar to previous data, PC-CO mightoverestimate very high CO, which usually does not influenceclinical practice.

The precision of thenew calibration process is able to detect a least significant change(LSC) of 17% [1]. The primary aim of this study was to evaluatethe drift after an initial calibration with two lithium dilution curves.The second aim of the study was to evaluate the relationshipbetween the magnitude of the time to recalibration and themagnitude of the drift.Methods Patients requiring monitoring with the LiDCOplus received an initial calibration plus a second calibration when clinicallyindicated. Data were downloaded from devices and analysed usingthe LiDCOviewPRO v.1 program. Absent, abandoned or rejectedcalibration curves were excluded. Calibration factors from the firstand second calibrations were compared. All recalibrations in whichthe drift was higher than the LSC (17%) were considered usefulcalibrations. Regression analysis for the time to recalibration and driftwas performed. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis wasperformed for the time free of calibration and the usefulness ofcalibrations (drift >17%).Results A total of 45 files from 45 patients with two calibration points were identified. Patient mean age was 62 (39 to 88) years,mean height 1.69 (1.40 to 1.94) metres and mean weight 70.9 (40to 155) kg. Time to recalibration varied from 5 to 39 hours.

In 22 (49%) patients the drift was higher than 17%(necessary calibration).Regression analysis did not show any significant relationshipbetween the time to recalibration and drift. This was confirmed byreceiver operating characteristic curve analysis.Conclusions The new implemented calibration process (using the average of two curves) does not show any drift depending on time.Despite this, 51% of the recalibrations are necessary (drift >17%).Further data analysis is necessary to identify when to recalibrate.Reference1.

P219 Individualized intraoperative patient optimization using uncalibrated arterial pressure waveform analysis in high-risk patients undergoing major abdominal surgery J Mayer, J Boldt, R Beschmann, A Stephan, (doi: 10.1186/cc7383) Introduction Established methods to optimize cardiac function and fluid balance based on flow-related variables are invasive orrequire considerable attentiveness. The purpose of this study wasto guide intraoperative fluid and catecholamine therapy in patientswith pre-existing cardiac disease undergoing major abdominalsurgery using a recently introduced less-invasive device withoutthe need for manual calibration (FloTrac/Vigileo) and to deter-mine possible improvement in outcome by means of N-terminalpro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) plasma levels and theduration of hospital stay.Methods Forty American Society of Anesthesiologists III patients scheduled for elective major abdominal surgery with pre-existingcardiac disease (coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction,cardiac surgery, heart failure, cardiomyopathy) were studied. Patientswere randomly allocated into a standard care group and anintervention group, where a stroke volume variation (SVV) andcardiac index (CI)-based protocol for volume and catecholaminetherapy was implemented until the end of surgery. In brief, CI2.5 l/min/m 2was aimed for, with a SVV threshold value for fluid challenge of 12%. After the baseline (skin incision), haemodynamicdata and plasma NT-proBNP levels were obtained after 180 minutes,at the end of surgery, 5 hours post surgery, and on postoperativedays 1 and 2, and the ICU and hospital stays were recorded.Results Demographic data and Physiological and Operative Severity Score for the Enumeration of Mortality and Morbidityphysiology and operation score values were comparable betweenthe groups. The intervention group received significantly morecolloid volume replacement and more dobutamine; crystalloidvolume replacement and norepinephrine consumption did not differ.Plasma NT-proBNP levels were significantly higher in the standardcare group on postoperative days 1 and 2 (832 \u00b1 675 vs. pg/ml). The meanhospital stay was reduced in the intervention group (14.8 \u00b1 4.7days) versus 20.6 \u00b1 8.1 days in the standard care group(P= 0.009), whereas the ICU stay did not differ significantly. Conclusions The use of uncalibrated arterial waveform analysis (FloTrac/Vigileo) for intraoperative patient optimization in patientswith pre-existing cardiac disease undergoing major abdominalsurgery is associated with a reduction of hospital stay and lowerplasma NT-proBNP levels.P220 Evaluation of the effectiveness of different volume replacement therapies in postoperative hypovolemic patients using the PiCCO monitoring system T Gondos1, Marjanek2, Z Ulakcsai3, 1): P220 (doi: 10.1186/cc7384) Introduction We have no exact information about the hemo- dynamically relevant intravascular volume effect of different volumereplacements. The aim of the study was to describe the changes inintravascular volume status 120 minutes after the start of theinfusions using a transpulmonary thermodilution technique (PiCCOsystem; Pulsion).Methods The prospective, randomized, multicentre study 11 ICUs involved 200 mixed postoperative hypovolemic patients inHungary between 2005 and 2008. Ten millilitres per kilogram oflactated (LR) or (HES), or 5% human albumin (HA) was infused to50 patients in each group over 30 minutes. Hemodynamicmeasurements were taken at baseline, 30, 45, 60, 90 and120 minutes after the start of infusion.Results There were no significant differences in basic demographic and laboratory data among the four groups.Differences between baseline and 120-minute values of the samesolution were significant only for the colloids: mean arterialpressure variation (SVV): HES -15%, HA -25%; oxygen delivery index 5%, has no demonstrable hemodynamic effect 120 minutes afterthe start of infusion. The colloid solutions have slightly differenthemodynamic effects. Ten millilitres per kilogram of colloids canimprove the hemodynamic parameters but their level is only 30%maximum comparing with the baseline at the end of the second hour. P221 Coupling of cardiac index and global end-diastolic volume index: is it mathematical or something else? T (doi: 10.1186/cc7385) Introduction Our goal was to analyse the relationship between the cardiac index (CI) and the global end-diastolic volume indexCritical Care March 2009 Vol 13 Suppl 1 29th International Symposium on Intensive Care and Emergency MedicineS91(GEDVI), a volumetric preload parameter measured by the single transpulmonary indicator dilution technique, in a mixed populationof intensive care patients. We hypothesized a close mathematicalconnection underlying observed clinical changes.Methods An observational study (OTKA T 046538) in the medical-surgical ICU of a teaching hospital. Hemodynamic datafrom 32 patients (altogether 122 datasets) were included in theanalysis using the PiCCO system (Pulsion, Germany). TheCI-GEDVI relationship was investigated using a regressionanalysis between the main components of the equation: GEDVI =CI x (MTt - DSt) (MTt = mean transit time, DSt = downslope time).To illustrate purely mathematical relationships, the theoreticalcorrelation lines were calculated and compared with the measureddata. To demonstrate the complex relationship among all threeparameters a three-dimensional (3D) presentation was applied.Results The 3D presentation resulted in a good fit of the measured values onto the theoretical surface ( r= 0.98). In GEDVI-CI and GEDVI-(MTt-DSt) there were aspects of the 3D surface where thecorrelation was weak ( r= 0.35 and 0.34). However, classifying the data according to the ranges of the third parameter, a positive linearregression was observable in each range with high correlationcoefficients. In the CI-(MTt-DSt) aspect of the 3D surface theregression was better ( r= 0.76), supporting the role of hydro- dynamic rules, and the correlation curve crossed the theoretical iso-GEDVI lines, suggesting the effect of the Frank-Starling mechanism.Conclusions Our study has demonstrated that there are three mechanisms working at the same time in the relationship betweenGEDVI and CI. The basic mathematical coupling is modified byhydrodynamic rules and the final relationship is adjusted byphysiological factors. The complex analysis revealed that CI andGEDVI are related parameters even in clinical situations. Thephysiological influences can modify this relationship significantly,however, especially in low ranges of CI. Evaluating the GEDVI wehave to consider the CI values because the intravascular volumestatus depends on the relationship of these two parameters (highGEDVI with low CI - volume overload, the same GEDVI with highCI - normovolaemia). P222 Comparison of transpulmonary of end-diastolic volume index, extravascular lung waterindex and central venous pressure with radiographic estimation of these parameters using computed tomography W Huber, 10.1186/cc7386) Introduction In critical illness, optimization of the fluid status is of central importance. This study aims to investigate whetherradiographic estimation of the global end-diastolic volume index(GEDI), the extravascular lung water index (CVP) using computed tomography (CT) is ableto noninvasive evaluation of fluid status.Methods Thirty-two CT scans, 26 ICU patients. Estimation of and CVP using CT. Transpulmonary thermodilutionusing the PiCCO within at most 6 hours (mean 2.25 hours) beforeor after CT.Results The diagnostic accuracy of CT-based estimation of the volume status (GEDI <680, 680 to 800, >800) was 25%.Sensitivity and specificity at diagnosis of hypovolemia were 0%and 100%, respectively. The positive predictive value (PPV) forhypovolemia was 0%. The negative predictive value (NPV) was74%. In prediction of a hypervolemia, radiographic estimation hada ml/kg) hada of sensitivity for ELWI different P= 0.029; underestimation of CT-estimated GEDI in only prediction of CVP (1 to 9 or>9 mmHg) the estimation using CT had an accuracy of only 53%.Sensitivity for prediction using CT is difficult. Estimation of the GEDI is not accurate, sensitive orspecific for prediction of hypovolemia. At prediction of hyper-volemia, radiographic estimation of the GEDI is suitable. Atassessment of elevated ELWI, the radiologist overestimates ELWIvalues of CVP, the radiographic estimation is not sufficientlyaccurate, sensitive or specific. Values for the GEDI and ELWIassessed using CT or PiCCO are significantly different. Diagnosticsensitivity/specificity of radiographic estimation probably can beimproved by interdisciplinary training.

Wetherefore studied the factors that affect physician knowledge and skill.Methods We enrolled 12 shocked patients admitted to the medical ICU, their symptoms having been evaluated by the patient-care team for defining the type of shock [1,2]. Venous cathe-terization (central venous pressure) and arterial catheterization(A-line) had been performed for invasive monitoring data [3]. Afterthat either clinical evaluation data or invasive monitoring data werecollected for analysis [4].Results All 12 shock patients, seven men and five women, were defined in four groups: hypovolemic, cardiogenic, obstructive anddistributive/septic shock in four cases, two cases, one case, andfive cases, respectively. Shock was defined by 38 volunteerphysicians, 27 men and 11 women. All physicians were studying inthe training program: 28 were in the residency program (first,second and third years - 12, eight and eight physicians,respectively), 10 in the fellowship training program (first and secondyears equally). We found that training physicians can define the typeof shock by clinical evaluation in 65.7% (residents vs. fellows64.29% vs. 80%, P <0.05), and fellowship physicians can define the type of shock significantly better than residency physicians(P<0.05). Male physicians can define the type of shock significantly better than females (male vs. female 70.37% vs. 54.54%, P <0.05). In meta-analysis, clinical evaluating factors such as jugular venouspressure, capillary filling time and lung fine crepitation are correlatedsignificantly with invasive monitoring factors.Conclusions Physician experience is important for clinical evaluation. It can be used for evaluating shocked patients nearly aswell as invasive monitoring. It can decrease procedure compli-cations and cost. Gender is an interesting factor that affectedevaluating abilities, it should be studied in greater numbers and in adifferent population for other significant statistics.Available online http://ccforum.com/supplements/13/S1S92References 1.

P224 Influence of prone positioning on measurement of extravascular lung water and pulmonary vascular permeability indexes by SG thermodilution of the extravascular lung water index (EVLWI), whichhas been described in experimental and clinical studies to beaccurate when compared with the reference method (that is,transpulmonary double indicator technique) [1,2]. In this study, theinfluence of prone positioning on the reliability of the measurementof the EVLWI and the pulmonary vascular permeability index (PVPI) a of capillary function - by transpulmonary thermo-dilution was assessed.Methods We prospectively studied 12 consecutive critically ill patients (eight male, four female, age 20 to 64 years) receivingmechanical ventilation, who for clinical indication due to severe chesttrauma or acute respiratory distress syndrome underwent modifiedprone positioning and extended hemodynamic monitoring by thetranspulmonary thermodilution technique (PiCCO \u00ae; Pulsion Medical AG). In all patients, an arterial thermistor catheter (A.femoralis) was placed and connected to a monitor (PiCCO \u00aeplus, version 7.0 nonUS). Measurements of cardiac output, (ITBV), EVLWI (five central venous ml NaCl, <8\u00b0C) were performed 10 minutes beforeand after turning the patients into a modified prone position (135\u00b0)from a supine position. No changes in respirator settings and fluidstatus were made. The statistical analysis was performed by linearregression and according to Bland-Altman.Results The range for the EVLWI was 5.0 to 21.0 and 5.0 to 22.7 ml/kg at the two time points. Linear regression analysisrevealed r= 0.95 (mean bias 0.5 ml/kg, one standard deviation 1.4 ml/kg). Furthermore, the PVPI ranged from 1.9 to 5.3 beforeand 1.7 to 5.8 after prone positioning. Correlation coefficient wasr= 0.96 (mean bias 0.04, one standard deviation 0.35). The linear regression analysis with respect to the ITBV at the two time pointsshowed r= 0.96, respectively.

During the IABP assistance, significant changesin arterial pressure waveform occur. The so-called proper algorithms to analyse the arterialpressure waveform and obtain the cardiac output (CO) [1]. As aconsequence, changes in pressure waveform in patients on IABPmay affect the reliability of different PCMs. The aim of this study wasto investigated the reliability of a new PCM, the MostCare poweredby the pressure recording Vygon, Ecouen, France), thermodilution (ThD-CO) during aortic counterpulsation.Methods Eight patients requiring hemodynamic support with an IABP after coronary surgery were studied. A thermodilutionpulmonary artery catheter was inserted. To compute the CO fromthe analysis of the radial artery pressure waveform, the MostCarewas connected via a cable to the monitoring system (HewlettPackard, Andover, MA, USA). The comparisons of CO values bythe two techniques were carried out at four different IABP settings:1:1, 1:2; 1:3, and 1:4. Pearson's correlation and Bland-Altmananalysis were applied. Percentages of error were also calculated.Results A total of 64 ThD-CO and PRAM-CO measurements were evaluated. ThD-CO values ranged from 2.4 to 6.8 l/min; PRAM-COvalues ranged from 2.6 to 6.2 l/min. Mean ThD-CO rangedfrom 4.0 \u00b1 rangedfrom 3.9 \u00b1 0.8 l/min. At each IABP methods 0.90, 0.87, 0.88, and0.86; (2) mean biases were 0.11, 0.05, 0.12; and (3)percentages Bolus thermodilution and MostCare showed a good agreement at each time of the study. Although the IABP altered thearterial pressure wave profile this did not seem to affect the capabilityof the MostCare to adequately estimate the CO.

P226 Validation of the extravascular lung water by single transpulmonary thermodilution in the clinical setting T Tagami1, S Kushimoto2, Masuno2, R Tosa1, (doi: 10.1186/cc7390) Introduction While it is known extravascular lung water (EVLW) estimated by transpulmonary single thermodilutioncorrelates closely with gravimetric measurements of lungs inexperimental animal models, the correlation in human beings,especially in the clinical setting, is still unclear. The aim of our studyCritical Care March 2009 Vol 13 Suppl 1 29th International Symposium on Intensive Care and Emergency MedicineS93was to validate EVLW measured by the PiCCO system in the clinical setting. Methods We retrospectively analyzed the data of all 23 cadavers whose EVLW was measured using the single indicator trans- pulmonary thermodilution system (PiCCO; Pulsion Medical Systems, Germany) at four teaching hospitals from July 2004 to November 2008. We evaluated the relationship between EVLW, the postmortem lung weight and the amount of plural effusion. Results Although the amount of the plural effusion was between 10 ml and 1,600 ml, we found very close correlation between pre- mortem transpulmonary measurements of EVLW and postmortem lung weight (Figure 1; n= 23, R= 0.954, R2= 0.91). Conclusions Measurement of the EVLW using the PiCCO system is very closely correlated with gravimetric measurement of lung weight, which is independent of the amount of pleural fluid. P227 Relation between mixed venous and central venous saturation in sepsis: influence of source of sepsis PA Van Beest1, M Koopmans2, J Van Ingen3, 13(Suppl 1): P227 (doi: 10.1186/cc7391) Introduction There remains controversy concerning the use of central venous oxygen saturation (ScvO2) or mixed venous oxygen saturation a marker for resuscitation, including their interchangeability [1,2]. We tested the hypothesis that in sepsis ScvO2does not reliably predict SvO2, independent of the sepsis origin. Methods We determined ScvO2and SvO2in a group of patients with sepsis in 6-hour intervals during the first 24 hours after acute admission. Results Data of 29 septic patients were collected: 10 patients with abdominal sepsis and 19 patients with other sources of sepsis (nonabdominal group) (Table 1). Univariate analysis from the total population and both groups separately did not show any parameter (cardiac output, cardiac index, dopamine, nor- epinephrine, See Figure 1.Conclusions We conclude that in sepsis ScvO2does not reliably predict SvO2, independent of the sepsis origin. The difference between ScvO2and SvO2in sepsis appears not to be a fixed one. Also, this difference seems independent of several hemodynamic parameters. References 1.

The POMS is a method for describing complicationsassociated with major surgery [1]. It comprises a nine-point surveyand provides a generic measure of short-term postoperativeoutcome.Methods Prospective ScvO 2values were collected from patients undergoing major abdominal surgery. This was done by intermittentsampling of blood obtained from the distal lumen of a centralvenous catheter placed in the jugular vein. The POMS was used toassess outcome on postoperative days 1, 3, 5, 8, 15 and 21 ifapplicable. To accommodate local practice, however, we excludedurinary catheter, pain and mobility from the POMS as it was not atrue reflection of organ dysfunction in our study population. Weevaluated other individual postsurgical complications as outlined inthe POMS to establish whether intraoperative median, minimumand ScvO 2(end of surgery value minus start of surgery value) are related to outcome.Results Fifty-two patients (average age 67.8, SD 12.0) were included. The Portsmouth Physiological and Operative SeverityScore for the Enumeration of Mortality and Morbidity revealed apredicted morbidity of 54.2% and mortality of 3.3%. Thecommonest complications were gastrointestinal and infection(58.7% and 19.2%, respectively). minimum and ScvO 2with postoperative compli- cation and length of hospital stay. However, ScvO2for patients who exhibited postoperative complication on day 3 was signifi-cantly different from the patients who did not ( P= 0.035) but the actual difference was only 2%. Minimum ScvO 2correlated weakly with high arterial lactate measured at the end of the procedure(Spearman r= 0.32, P=0.025).

P229 impedance Steinhilp1, Bubser1, S Wiesener1, C Introduction Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) is a widely used method for calculating body compartments in healthysubjects and chronically ill patients. The resistance (R) - which iscorrelated with total body water - and the reactance (Xc) -depending on the capacitance of cell membranes - are measuredby BIA. The phase angle , a mathematical relation between R and Xc, has qualified as a prognostic marker in several severe diseases[1]. We aimed at monitoring body composition during the clinicalcourse of ICU patients and to investigate the impact of illnessseverity on BIA.Methods In this observational study we performed BIA testing at the frequencies of 50 kHz unilaterally between the wrist and anklewith a body impedance analyzer. BIA of ICU patients took place onthree different measuring points: M1, M2 and M3 (days 2 to 3,days 10 to 11 and days 14 to 15 after admission). Severity ofillness was monitored by Simplified Acute Physiology Score(SAPS) II. BIA results of each patient were matched with a standard collective according to sex, age, and body mass index.Spearman's rho ( rs) has been calculated to analyze correlation between and SAPS II. Nonparametric analysis of longitudinal data was carried out to analyze two groups differentiated by SAPSII (Group 1: 45 points, Group 2: >45 points). Results Forty-eight patients received one measurement at M1, 28 patients were measured at all three measuring points. BIA of ourpatients differed considerably from the normal collective. Therewere significant differences between the patients grouped byprimary disease (abdominal cancer patients, nontumor patients,neurosurgical patients, multiple trauma and acute respiratorydistress syndrome). is correlated with the ICU score SAPS II on admission at all three measuring points (M1: n= 48, rs = -0.296, P 28, rs = -0.525, P <0.005). While we did not find a significant change of R in our subsequent measurement, there was a decrease of Xc(P<0.05). Especially in the more serious ill patients (Group 2), this has been observed ( P <0.05). Conclusions BIA helps to estimate body composition at ICU admission. It is associated with primary disease and severity ofillness. During the clinical course we observed a decrease of Xc,indicating loss of body cell mass.Reference1.

P230 Estimated respiratory quotient and venoarterial pCO2 difference are outcome markers in patients with left ventricular dysfunction submitted to coronary artery bypass surgery L Hajjar, T Yamaguti, F Galas, R Kalil Filho, M Piccioni, 1): P230 (doi: 10.1186/cc7394) Introduction Experimental and clinical research has successfully evaluated the performance of the respiratory quotient as a usefulmarker of anaerobic metabolism in shock from different causes.The aim of the present study was to evaluate the estimatedrespiratory quotient and venoarterial pCO 2difference as suitable anaerobic metabolism signs and outcome markers in patients withleft ventricular dysfunction undergoing coronary artery bypasssurgery.Methods A prospective study including 87 patients with left ventricular dysfunction undergoing coronary artery bypass surgerywith pump was performed from January 2006 to January 2008.Hemodynamic and metabolic parameters were obtained during fivemoments: after anesthesia induction and mechanical ventilationinitiation (T0), at end of surgery (T1), at admission to thepostsurgical ICU (T2), and 6 hours after (T3) and 12 hours afterICU admission (T4). The venoarterial carbon dioxide tensiondifference ( pCO 2) and estimated respiratory quotient (eRQ) were also calculated. Postoperative outcomes were compared regardingclinical events and mortality.Results In patients with unfavorable postoperative evolution, the eRQ values as venoarterial pCO 2presented significantly higher values at T4 compared with other groups (1.94 \u00b1 0.9 vs. 1.43 P<0.05; 8.07 \u00b1 3.24 vs. 5.66 \u00b1 2.78, P<0.05). Patients with unfavorable evolution had significant higher levels of arteriallactate concentration at 6 hours after ICU admission (4.30 \u00b1 2.47vs. 2.72 \u00b1 1.48, P<0.05). Stepwise logistic regression showed that a higher age, higher estimated respiratory quotient at T4, andCritical Care March 2009 Vol 13 Suppl 1 29th International Symposium on Intensive Care and Emergency MedicineS95higher lactate at T3 were all independently associated with unfavor- able postoperative evolution (OR = 1.12; OR = 3.45; OR = 1.46). Conclusions In a population of patients with left ventricular dysfunction submitted to coronary artery bypass surgery, age, postoperative arterial lactate, eRQ and venoarterial PCO2after 12 hours of ICU admission are independent predictors of unfavorable outcome.

P231 Clinical value of noninvasive pulmonary artery systolic pressure estimates in our patients with pulmonary artery hypertension T ubic, I Drinovec, F ifrer University Clinic of Respiratory and Allergic Diseases, Golnik, Slovenia Critical Care 2009, 13(Suppl 1): P231 (doi: 10.1186/cc7395) Introduction Invasive and noninvasive measurements of pulmonary artery pressures are used to diagnose and control patients with pulmonary artery hypertension (PAH) [1-3]. In our hospital all patients with PAH are diagnosed and first treated in the ICU. Besides right heart catheterization (RHC), noninvasive estimate of pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP) with transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) is performed. As RHC is an invasive procedure it is not suitable to repeat it. We compared values of invasively and noninvasively measured PASP to examine correlation so we could use TTE for ambulatory control and estimation of treatment success in our patients. Methods In a retrospective manner we examined the correlation between pulmonary artery pressures estimated by TTE versus RHC among our patients, diagnosed for PAH from 2003 to 2007. The data were collected from 36 patients with PAH of differentcause (chronic pulmonary thromboembolism, 12 patients; connective tissue disease, 10 patients; idiopathic pulmonary artery hypertension, eight patients; other, six patients). Bivariate correlations were used for statistical analysis. Results The median time interval between methods was 2 (1 to 30) days. The median PASP by RHC was 74.8 (30 to 122) mmHg and by TTE was 62.3 (41 to 110) mmHg ( r= 0.65, P <0.0001). In 29 (80.6%) patients the difference between the two methods was >20 mmHg, and in 10 (27.8%) patients it was <10 mmHg. We did not find a difference between the two methods regarding the cause of PAH. Conclusions In our group of patients we found a week correlation between invasively and noninvasively estimated PASP. However, there has been a trend of good correlation for a small proportion of our patients. We conclude that when the first measurements by TTE and RHC correlate well we can use TTE for future evaluation of disease progress and treatment response. When the measurements of the two methods differ we have to exclude potential reversible cause (different examiner, different conditions, to wide time interval) and serial invasive measurements may be needed.

The target hemodynamic parameters forAvailable online http://ccforum.com/supplements/13/S1 Figure 1 (abstract P232) S96goal-directed fluid therapy remain controversial, with concerns regarding the risk of overhydration. We used a splanchnic ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) model with a high mortality rate to test whether fluid infusion aimed to target constant left ventricular end- diastolic volume (LVEDV) would ameliorate physiologic and biologic parameters in this situation. Methods Two groups of adult rats were subjected to 90 minutes of mesenteric ischemia followed by 150 minutes of reperfusion, with one group (I/R+Vol) receiving fluids (one-half glucose 5% and one-half Isohes\u00ae) to maintain the LVEDV at baseline levels during reperfusion, and the other group (I/R) receiving no extra fluids. A sham group (instrumented without I/R) served as controls. Results In spite of a persisting acidosis, the LVEDV-directed fluid therapy was able to prevent the rapid fatal outcome, without evidence of overhydration (Figure 1), as demonstrated by the absence of an increased lung wet/dry weight ratio. Conclusions Early LVEDV-directed fluid therapy markedly improves the outcome from mesenteric I/R injury. P233 Utility of brain natriuretic peptide as a marker of early cardiac risk in patients undergoing elective abdominal aortic aneurism repair L Vetrugno, F Bassi, L Cereatti, E Di Luca, F Giordano Care 2009, 1): (doi: 10.1186/cc7397) Introduction Patients undergoing elective aortic abdominal aneurysm repair are at increased risk of perioperative mortality and morbidity. The majority of deaths in this setting are related to cardiac complications. Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) has recently emerged as a predictive value in this context [1]. The current study tests this hypothesis. Methods We studied 34 patients. After a preoperative interview by a senior anesthetist who assessed cardiovascular status following the recommendations proposed by the American College of Cardiology-American Heart Association, BNP levels were obtained just before surgery and were blinded to the anesthetist. Myocardial injury was defined as a cardiac troponine concentration 1.5 ng/ml. Statistical analysis was performed using Student's t test. Results We found cardiac troponine 1.5 ng/ml in five patients with myocardial injury. The preoperative BNP value was 379 (SD \u00b1282) pg/ml in patients with myocardial injury and 88.7 (SD \u00b161) pg/ml in those without events. The two-tailed P value was 0.08. Conclusions Preoperative BNP levels are higher in patients who develop myocardial injury; however, the P value was not quite significant. This could be explained with intraoperative surgical complications (technical difficulties, blood loss, acute hypotension, longer cross-clamp) affecting the outcome of the patient with low BNP.

Several recent studies reported the importance of ScvO2 monitoring in critically ill patients. Recently, ScvO2monitoring with fiberoptic catheters has been made available. The aim of this study was to evaluate the correlation between the ScvO2values obtained by a fiberoptic catheter (CeVOX; Seda, Milan, Italy) and those measured with a CO-oximeter (GEM 4000; Instrumentation Laboratory Milan, Italy). Methods After in vivo calibration of the fiberoptic catheter, blood samples were collected at intervals of no more than 12 hours. Twenty-nine critically ill patients from different aetiologies (septic shock, acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome pneumonia, pancreatitis, trauma), 21 male, with a mean age of 59.8 \u00b1 17.7 years, mean weight 78.6 \u00b1 10.0 kg and mean Simplified Acute Physiology Score of 39 \u00b1 14 were enrolled. Results One hundred and nineteen samples were collected. The ScvO2measured with the fiberoptic catheter showed a weak correlation ( r2= 0.46) with the CO-oximeter. The mean bias (average difference between catheter readings and CO-oximeter values), precision (standard deviation of the bias) and limits of agreement (bias \u00b1 2 SD of bias) were -0.17, 4.7 and -0.17 \u00b1 9.4 respectively (Figure 1). Conclusions Considering the absolute value, the fiberoptic catheter, after 12 hours of usage without any further calibration, presented a weak accuracy. To improve the clinical management we suggest performing in vivo calibration more frequently.Critical Care March 2009 Vol 13 Suppl 1 29th International Symposium on Intensive Care and Emergency Medicine Figure 1 (abstract P234) Plot of the mean ScvO2values versus their difference by the Bland-Altman method. S97P235 Venous oxygen saturation and lactate gradient from the superior vena cava to the pulmonary artery in ICU patients with septic shock P Kopterides1, I Mavrou1, E Kostadima2, E Zakynthinos2, Hospital of Larissa, Greece; 3Center for Diseases is considered comparable with mixed venous oxygen saturation(SvO 2) in the initial resuscitation phase of septic shock [1]. Our aim was to assess their agreement in septic shock in the ICUsetting and the effect of a potential difference in a computedparameter, namely oxygen consumption. In addition, we sought fora central venous to pulmonary artery (PA) lactate gradient.Methods We enrolled 37 patients with septic shock who were receiving noradrenaline infusions and whose attending physicianshad placed a PA catheter for fluid management. Blood sampleswere drawn in succession from the superior vena cava (CV), rightatrium (RA), right ventricle and PA. Hemodynamic and treatmentparameters were monitored and data were compared bias of -8.45% and 95% limits of agreement ranging from -20.23 to 3.33%. This differencecorrelated significantly to the noradrenaline infusion rate and theoxygen consumption and extraction ratio. These lower SvO 2values resulted in a computed oxygen consumption calculated withoxygen saturation of pulmonary artery blood higher than the oxygenconsumption calculated with oxygen saturation of central venousblood ( P<0.001), with a bias of 104.97 ml/min agreement from -4.12 to ml/min. Finally, lactate concentra-tion was higher in the CV than in the PA (2.42 suggest that ScvO 2and SvO2are not equivalent in ICU patients with septic shock. Additionally, thesubstitution of ScvO 2for SvO2in the calculation of oxygen consumption produces unacceptably large errors. Finally, thedecrease in lactate between RA and PA may support the hypo-thesis that the mixing of RA and coronary sinus blood is at leastpartially responsible for the difference between tissue oxygenation saturation in association with skin temperature as an indicator of the peripheral tissue perfusion in critically ill patients A Lima, C Ince, J Bakker Erasmus MC University Medical Centre Care 2009, 13(Suppl 1): P236 (doi: 10.1186/cc7400) Introduction Studies have suggested that tissue oxygenation saturation (StO 2) values are insensitive in assessing peripheralperfusion. StO2measurements may be more correctly interpreted if measured in association with the forearm-to-fingertip skin-tempera-ture gradient (Tskin-diff). A Tskin-diff threshold of 0\u00baC has beenshowed to reflect vasoconstriction. We aimed to propose adifferent approach for the interpretation of StO 2by adding Tskin- diff monitoring and to characterize the pattern of StO2dynamics in patients with peripheral vasoconstriction and vasodilation. Wehypothesize that monitoring StO 2with Tskin-diff can more adequately predict ICU complications than StO2itself. Methods StO2was continuously monitored on the thenar with an InSpectra Model 325 probe (Hutchinson Technology Inc.,Hutchinson, MN, USA). The Tskin-diff was obtained from two skinprobes (Hewlett Packard 21078A; Phips Medical Systems,Eindhoven, the Netherlands) attached to the index finger and onthe radial side of the forearm. To describe the effect of variations inskin temperature on StO 2, we compared StO2in survivors and nonsurvivors stratified by the Tskin-diff >0; vasodilation, Tskin-diff <0). Thefirst measurement was registered within 24 hours and then every24 hours until day 3. Differences between group means weretested by the Mann-Whitney U test. P<0.05 was considered statistically significant.Results We prospectively studied 41 consecutive critically ill patients (survivors = 29; nonsurvivors = 12): age: 49 \u00b1 16 years;20 septic 14 nonseptic shock, seven other. No differencesin StO 2were seen between survivors and nonsurvivors (day 1: 73 \u00b1 9 vs. 78 \u00b1 10; day 2: 74 \u00b1 11 vs. 75 \u00b1 11; day 3: 76 \u00b1 10vs. 77 \u00b1 9). In survivors, StO 2values were significantly lower in peripheral vasoconstriction than in vasodilation (day 1: 69 \u00b1 8 vs.76 \u00b1 8; day 2: 68 \u00b1 13 vs. 78 \u00b1 7; day 3: 71 \u00b1 10 vs. 80 \u00b1 9;P<0.05). In nonsurvivors, this association was seen only on day 1 (71 \u00b1 8 vs. 86 \u00b1 4; P<0.05). Compared with survivors on day 3, nonsurvivors had lower StO 2values in peripheral vasodilation (69 \u00b1 6 vs. 80 \u00b1 9, P= 0.02) and higher StO2values in peripheral vasoconstriction (83 \u00b1 7 vs. 71 \u00b1 10, P= 0.02). Conclusions Dissociation between StO2and skin temperature was seen more often in nonsurvivors. StO2measured in association with skin temperature can more adequately predictICU death than StO 2itself.

The nature of the relationship between the kinetics of StO2 and changes in peripheral circulation has not been investigated.After successful regional anaesthesia blocks, local vasodilation andincreased local blood flow occur as a result of blockade ofsympathetic nerve fibers. We therefore studied the effects ofperipheral vasodilation induced by regional anaesthesia blocks onresting StO 2values. Methods We recruited healthy adult patients ( n= 8) scheduled for selective upper limb surgery under axillary sympathetic blocks.StO 2was continuously monitored over the thenar of the blocked arm using an InSpectra Model 325 probe (Hutchinson TechnologyInc., Hutchinson, MN, USA) from the beginning of the localanesthetic (T0) injection until 30 minutes was elapsed (T30). Thecontralateral arm was used as a control. Differences betweenAvailable online http://ccforum.com/supplements/13/S1S98group means were tested by Wilcoxon signed test. P<0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results StO2values in the blocked arm were significantly higher in all patients after the anaesthesia (Figure 1). T30 versus T0, \u00b1 3; P= 0.002. StO2did not increase in the control arm. Conclusions Peripheral vasodilation increases StO2in normal conditions. P238 Effect of anemia on tissue oxygenation saturation and the tissue deoxygenation rate R Pareznik, P238 (doi: 10.1186/cc7402) Introduction The hypothesis was that independently of hemodynamic stability, affects tissue oxygenation saturation (StO2) and the deoxygenation rate during stagnant ischemia. The blood hemoglobin concentration is determinant of oxygen delivery. In anemic patients, oxygen delivery decreases and oxygen extraction is increased. This leads to decreased venous hemoglobin saturation and a lower tissue oxygen saturation. The rate of tissue deoxygenation during ischemia is dependent on oxygen con- sumption and on the amount of oxygen available in the tissue [1]. Methods In a prospective observational study we included 340 patients in the medical emergency room. On admission, StO2and the tissue deoxygenation rate during ischemia were measured by near-infrared spectroscopy. Patients were divided into four groups according to hemoglobin concentration and hemodynamic (HD) stability: Group 1 (nonanemic, HD-stable patients), Group 2 (anemic, HD-stable patients), Group 3 (nonanemic, HD-unstable patients), Group 4 (anemic, HD-unstable patients). Differences in StO2and the rate of tissue deoxygenation were analyzed. Results Anemic groups had a significantly lower hemoglobin concentration compared with nonanemic groups (138 \u00b1 16 vs.76.5 \u00b1 15 g/l, P <0.001). HD-unstable groups had significantly higher lactate levels compared with HD-stable groups (1.6 \u00b1 0.6 vs. 3.9 \u00b1 1.6 mmol/l, P <0.001). The results are presented in Table 1. StO2in Groups 2 and 3 was comparable, while the difference in the deoxygenation rate in these groups was significant (P= 0.007). Conclusions Anemia significantly affects StO2and the deoxy- genation rate. It probably contributes to lower StO2equally as HD instability. In contrast to HD instability, anemia causes more rapid deoxygenation during ischemia. Reference 1.

After cardiac surgery, the circulating blood volume and cardiac function is regularly reduced on the ICU [1]. This results in reduced microperfusion and peripheral vasoconstriction. The noninvasive InSpectra StO2 monitor (Hutchinson Technology Inc., Hutchinson, MN, USA) measures the oxygen saturation in the microcirculation of the thenar muscle [2]. Methods Forty patients after cardiac surgery were monitored with a StO2monitor and a Swan-Ganz catheter measuring CI and SvO2on the ICU. Additionally intermittent lactate and blood gas analysis was performed. ANOVA was used for statistics of results. Results The mean Euro-Score of the patients was 6.5 \u00b1 3.7 including 24 aortocoronary bypass, five heart valve, three ascen- ding aorta and eight combined cardiac operations.

On day 1 the noradrenaline dose dropped after fluid substitution, but only the StO 2value recovered. Conclusions After heart surgery StO2indicated the reduction as well as the recovery of microcirculation early, whereas the lactateconcentration and SvO 2seemed to demonstrate a delayed response especially of recovery. Management of postoperativefluid and catecholamine therapy by StO 2to optimize micro- circulation should be the subject of further studies.References1.

P240 Comparison of oxygenation response curves to time-based vascular occlusion tests: evidence of diminishing returns? SJ Thomson, N Al-Subaie, M Hamilton, ML Cowan, S Musa, M Grounds, TM RahmanSt George's Hospital NHS (doi: 10.1186/cc7404) Introduction Dynamic of 2) with near-infrared spectroscopy and vascular occlusion (VOT) hasbeen used to study pathophysiological states, but there is apaucity of data for standardised techniques in normal subjects.Three-minute VOT is frequently described. We have collectedStO 2data for this technique and compared them with a shorter 2-minute test.Methods Twenty-five subjects were studied using an InSpectra 650 monitor and a 15 mm probe. VOT was applied at systolicblood pressure + 50 mmHg on opposite arms for 3-minute and2-minute time periods. StO 2data are reported for areaover recoverycurve (AUC Rec)%/minute and recovery time (Rec Time) inminutes. Differences were analysed using paired ttests. Individual differences were then examined in relation to a predicted magni-tude of response based on the ischaemic load and P = 0.01), Rec Time (2.37 vs. 2.05 min, P = 0.004). DS (-11.18 vs. -12.35%/min, P = 0.08) and US (212.99 vs. P= 0.365) were not significantly different. The 2-minute ischaemicload was 0.5 times that of 3 minutes (AOC Isch -25.79/-52.99). The ratios of response parameters were compared with this valueusing one-sample ttests and 0.21, P <0.001). Conclusions StO 2VOT is a promising tool that is likely to advance our knowledge of microvascular function under ischaemic stress.To standardise data interpretation it is imperative that similartechniques are used. We have reported data for two reproducibleVOTs in a healthy control group. Understandably, there aredifferences in hyperaemic response parameters that are dependenton the ischaemic time; however, the relationship is no linear. Ourdata suggest that although 2-minute VOT represents a halving ofthe ischaemic load versus 3 minutes, subjects demonstrate almost90% comparable hyperaemic responses. This suggests adiminishing return in hyperaemia with longer occlusive time. Furtherwork is required to evaluate the efficacy and practicality of differentVOTs. P241 Adaptability of muscle vascular occlusion SJ Thomson, N Al-Subaie, M Hamilton, ML Cowan, S Musa, RM Grounds, TM RahmanSt George's Hospital NHS (doi: 10.1186/cc7405) Introduction Dynamic of (StO 2) with near-infrared spectroscopy and vascular occlusion (VOT) is adeveloping area of research in critical care. VOT is often performedmultiple times during analysis. We report the impact of repeatedVOT on StO 2parameters. Methods Twenty-five healthy subjects were studied with the InSpectra 650 monitor and a 15 mm probe. VOT was set atsystolic blood pressure + 50 mmHg for 3 minutes in triplicate.Each VOT was separated by a 5-minute rest period. StO 2data are reported for baseline%, downslope (DS) and upslope over the Isch) and the recovery curve (AUC Rec)%/min and recovery time (RecTime) in minutes. Data were compared by ANOVA.Results See Table 1. Conclusions It is important to understand the impact of serial VOT. We have observed sequential change in rates of StO 2 decline during ischaemia (reduced DS gradients, total drop andAOC Isch). Although the overshoot was unchanged, the AUC Recand Rec time demonstrated increases approaching significance.These patterns imply a preconditioned adaptation to repeated VOTand an exaggerated hyperaemic response. Further studies arerequired to determine acceptable rest periods between VOTs toameliorate these changes.Available online http://ccforum.com/supplements/13/S1 Table 1 (abstract P241) Population StO2means (\u00b1SD) for consecutive VOT and significance StO2curve Baseline Total drop DS US AOC Isch Overshoot 0.09 Microcirculatory, and survival time in nonhypotensive endotoxemia A Santos, E Furtado, N Villela, E Bouskela State University of Rio 1): P242 (doi: 10.1186/cc7406) interaction and survival time effects of dobutamine in the dose of 5 g/kg/ minute associated or not with volume resuscitation were studied inthe hamster window chamber model during were submitted to endotoxemia injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in the dose of2 mg/kg. After 3 hours of LPS injection they were divided into fourgroups: LPS 0.9% in 1 hourfollowed by 20 ml/kg body weight the remaining 4 hours;Dobuta ( n= 6): received dobutamine infusion ( 0.9% in the first hour followed by20 ml/kg body weight during the remaining 2 hours, the lastcombined with dobutamine in the dose of 5 g/kg/minute. The groups were compared with Control ( n= 7): no treatment. Arteriolar survival time were evaluated.Results Dobuta had lower arteriolar diameter than Control (51 \u00b1 10 and 114 \u00b1 10% from baseline). LPS and Dobuta had lower FCDthan Control and baseline values (18 \u00b1 15; 16 \u00b1 18; and 88 \u00b1 Dobuta and Control, respectively). VR andVR/Dobuta restored FCD from baseline (382 \u00b1 19 and \u00b1 30%from in VR and VR/Dobuta, respectively). FCD in VR andVR/Dobuta were lower than Control. LPS and Dobuta had adhesion than groups, respec- tively). There was no significant difference in survival time betweenVR and Control, and VR/Dobuta and Control. Survival time wassignificantly lower in LPS and Dobuta than Control.Conclusions Dobutamine associated or not with volume resuscitation did not improve microcirculatory parameters,leucocyte adhesion or resuscitation fromnonhypotensive resuscitation restoredmicrocirculatory parameters and improved survival time.References1.

VR/rCRP restored it was not different from Control (72 \u00b1 26% from baseline inrCRP). Arteriolar and venular diameters were not different amonggroups. LPS increased the number of sticking leukocytes to thevenular (41.2 \u00b1 13 and 1.1 \u00b1 leucocytes/mm rCRP and VR/rCRP, respectively). There was no difference in rolling leukocytes among groups. The survivalcurve was not significantly different in rCRP, VR and VR/rCRPfrom Control.Conclusions rCRP associated or not with resuscitation improved tissue perfusion, reduced the number of stickingleukocytes and increased the survival time during endotoxemia hamster model.References1.

P244 Assessment of tissue oxygen saturation during a vascular occlusion test using near-infrared spectroscopy: role of theprobe spacing and measurement site studied in healthy volunteers R Bezemer1, A Lima2, E Klijn2, J Bakker2, Introduction To assess potential microcirculatory alterations in critically ill patients, near-infrared spectroscopy(NIRS) has been used, in combination with a vascular occlusiontest (VOT), for the noninvasive measurement of tissue oxygensaturation (StO 2), oxygen consumption, and microvascular reper- fusion and reactivity. However, the methodologies for assessingStO 2are very inconsistent in the literature and results vary from study to study. In this study we investigated the effects of theCritical Care March 2009 Vol 13 Suppl 1 29th International Symposium on Intensive Care and Emergency MedicineS101probe spacing and measurement site, using both a 15 mm and a 25 mm probe spacing on the thenar and the forearm, in healthy volunteers. Methods StO2was noninvasively measured in eight healthy volunteers during 3-minute VOTs using two InSpectra Tissue Spectrometers equipped with either a 15 mm or a 25 mm probe. VOT-derived StO2traces were analyzed for baseline, ischemic, reperfusion, and hyperemic parameters. Results Although not apparent at baseline, the probe spacing and measurement site significantly influenced VOT-derived StO2 parameters (Figures 1 and 2). StO2parameters in the hyperemic phase of the VOT were shown to significantly correlate to the minimum StO2value after 3 minutes of ischemia. Conclusions The present study showed that NIRS measurements in combination with a VOT are measurement site and probe dependent. Additionally, this study indicated that reactive hyperemia depends on the extent of ischemic hit and supports the use of a target StO2over the use of a fixed time of occlusion.P245 Effects of perfusion pressure on microcirculatory perfusion of gastric tubes in pigs E Klijn, S Niehof, J De Jonge, J Bakker, C Ince, J Van Bommel Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam, the Netherlands Critical Care 2009, 13(Suppl 1): P245 (doi: 10.1186/cc7409) Introduction It is known that of a gastric tube after esophagectomy impairs microcirculatory perfusion in the anasto- motic microcirculatory perfusion is caused by poor arterial inflow and insufficient venous drainage, due to ligation of three of the four gastric arteries. We therefore hypothesized that improving venous drainage by giving nitroglycerin (NTG) and titrating norepinephrine (NE) to increasing levels of mean arterial pressure (MAP) would improve microcirculatory perfusion of the distal part of the gastric tube. Methods Five pigs, bodyweight 30.5 \u00b1 0.5 kg (mean \u00b1 SD) were anaesthesized and instrumented for continuous hemodynamic monitoring. A median laparotomy was performed and a gastric tube was reconstructed. Laser speckle imaging was used to measure the microcirculatory blood flow (MBF) in the gastric tube. Laser speckle imaging is a laser-based technique that measures MBF in a macroscopic field at a video frame rate. NTG was titrated to in order to achieve a central venous pressure below 10 mmHg. MBF was measured at the base and at the distal site of the gastric tube at MAP increasing stepwise from 50 to 110 mmHg. For this purpose the MAP was decreased with infusion of propofol and increased with infusion of NE. We determined the flow at the distal site for each step compared with flow at the base of the gastric tube (fraction of flow) in percentages. Results Hemodynamic values: MAP was increased in steps of 10 mmHg. The heart rate and cardiac output remained constant at around 123 \u00b1 28 bpm and 4.2 \u00b1 1.0 l/min, respectively. Central venous pressure and pulmonary artery occlusion pressure did not change throughout the experiment. MBF results: at MAP below 70 mmHg the fraction of flow at the distal part was 23.49 \u00b1 3.47%. This increased significantly to 31.12 \u00b1 9.15% at MAP between 70 and 90 mmHg. The fraction of flow for MAP above 90 mmHg was 29.42 \u00b1 6.84%. See Figure 1. Conclusions Hypotension impairs flow in the distal part compared with the base of the gastric tube. Normotension significantly improves flow in this region. MBF in the distal part does not benefit from increasing MAP to supranormal values.Available online http://ccforum.com/supplements/13/S1 Figure 1 (abstract 244) Mean \u00b1 SD StO2values in the thenar during a 3-minute VOT.

If ischemia-likeconditions are produced in the skin, use could enhance theinflammatory response and increase the risk of organ dysfunction.We exposed local areas of the skin in healthy volunteers totherapeutic levels of noradrenaline (NA) by infusion through micro-dialysis (MD) intradermally, to investigate whether autoregulatoryescape is present in the skin during strong 1-adrenergic stimulation.Methods Five subjects received three MD catheters (CMA 70) intradermally in the lower arm. Catheters were perfused for a90-minute stabilizing period, Ringer solution with 20 mmol/l urea,for skin blood flow determinations (urea clearance). Thereafter NA0.5 or 5 g/ml was perfused (2 l/min) for 60 minutes followed by a buffer washout period. After this 0.5 mg/ml nitroglycerine wasperfused (2 l/min) for 60 minutes. Samples were collected every 10 minutes and analysed for urea, lactate, pyruvate and glucose.Results During perfusion with NA 5 and 0.5 g/ml, skin blood flow decreased significantly as indicated by changes in urea clearance;increased lactate pyruvate quotients and corresponding rapiddecreases in tissue glucose levels. These changes furtherincreased during the perfusion of pure buffer. Normalization wasfirst noted during infusion of nitroglycerine.Conclusions Both doses of NA, previously claimed to be physio- logical, induce a reproducible and severe vasoconstriction asindicated by effects on urea clearance, increases in lactatepyruvate quotients and decreases in tissue glucose. These datasuggest that skin lacks an autoregulatory escape function andischemia was induced in the skin of healthy volunteers by the NAinfusion. The ischemia situation further deteriorated until an activevasodilatation was started. In this skin vascular model, in healthyvolunteers, NA shows negative effects that may also be importantfor the critical care setting. Further studies are needed to validatethese findings. P247 Alterations of tissue-dependent microcirculation in patients after successful resuscitation H Busch, S Rahner, C Bode, T Schwab University Freiburg, GermanyCritical Care 2009, 13(Suppl 1): P247 (doi: 10.1186/cc7411) Introduction The crucial role of the microcirculation in improved neurological outcome in patients after successful resuscitation hasbeen discussed for many years. New noninvasive imagingtechniques enable the visualization and analysis of the micro-circulation in vivo . Our study utilised an orthogonal polarization spectral (OPS) noninvasive imaging technique to testmicrocirculation in patients after successful resuscitation.Methods Between February and November 2008, 20 successfully resuscitated patients were investigated in the medical intensivecare department of Albert Ludwigs University, Freiburg. OPS measurements were performed at the time of mild therapeutichypothermia and after rewarming. These results were comparedwith the results of a control group that consists of 15 healthypeople. OPS measurements were performed using the MicroScanfrom MicroVisionMedical. The recorded sublingual microcirculationimages were analysed utilising the AVA software with a focus onthe microcirculation parameters of total vessel density (TVD,mm/mm 2) and perfused vessel density (PVD, mm/mm2). Results Patients after successful resuscitation showed a significant decrease in the tissue-dependent microcirculationcompared with control (TVD: 5.33 1.59 vs. 1.03; P = 0.0002). Patients after successful resuscitation showed, during therapeutichypothermia, a significant increased microcirculation (TVD effects were independent of the use of catecholamines.Conclusions We could demonstrate significant alterations of the tissue-dependent microcirculation in patients after successfulresuscitation. Patients in the post-resuscitation showedduring therapeutic hypothermia an microcirculation,reflecting TVD P248 Microcirculatory changes caused by magnesium sulphate infusion in severe sepsis and septic shock A Pranskunas, V Pilvinis Kaunas University of P248 (doi: 10.1186/cc7412) dysfunction is a key element in the pathogenesis of severe sepsis and septic shock and is related toendothelial dysfunction. Studies in vivo have shown that infusion of magnesium sulphate increased endothelium-dependent vasodila-tation in healthy people and patients with cardiac disorders, but theeffect on the septic patient's vessels, especially small ones, isunknown. We hypothesized that magnesium sulphate infusion canimprove microcirculation in patients with severe sepsis and septicshock.Methods Six septic patients (mean age 56 \u00b1 16 years), who had already been fluid resuscitated, underwent magnesium sulphateinfusion 2 g over 60 minutes with additional volume loading anduse of norepinephrine if six different sublingual areas (10 to20 seconds/image). In all patients, measurements were obtained atbaseline and after 60 minutes. Images were analyzed bysemiquantitative scores of flow (mean flow index; proportion ofperfused vessels) and density (total vascular density; perfusedvascular density) of small vessels (<20 m). Data are presented as median values (percentiles 25 to 75).Results Data of this study have shown that perfused vascular density increased from 9.7 (4.9 to 13.0) n/mm (at baseline) to 12.1(10.1 to 13.6) n/mm (at 60 min), proportion of perfused vesselsincreased from 70 (40 to 83)% to 77 (67 to 85)% but withoutstatistical significance, P = 0.068. Conclusions Magnesium sulphate has a tendency to improve microcirculation in severe sepsis and septic shock patients, butfurther studies are needed to obtain more detailed results.Critical Care March 2009 Vol 13 Suppl 1 29th International Symposium on Intensive Care and Emergency MedicineS103P249 Sepsis induces an early impairment of endothelial glycocalyx in glomerular capillaries L Vitali, V Selmi, A M Margheri, M Miranda, C Innocenti, R De Gaudio, C Adembri University of Florence, Italy Critical Care 2009, 13(Suppl 1): (doi: 10.1186/cc7413) Introduction The increase in endothelial permeability represents one of the early and significant hallmarks of sepsis. An inflammatory-induced damage in endothelial glycocalyx has been identified as the mechanism involved in this increase in perme- ability in the condition of ischemia-reperfusion [1]. To date no data are available for glycocalyx damage in sepsis. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether sepsis-associated increase of permeability is due to glycocalyx alteration. Methods To induce sepsis, the cecal ligation and puncture (CLP), a clinically relevant model of polymicrobial infection that mimics human sepsis, was used [2]. Nine rats underwent CLP, two rats, receiving laparotomy only, served as control. Rats were then transcardially perfused with PBS and PBS + paraformaldehyde 4% at three different time points (3, 7 and 15 hours after CLP). Kidneys were collected and processed for light and confocal microscopy examination. Alterations in glycocalyx were studied maackia amurensis agglutinin (MMA) (to identify sialic acids, a large family of nine-carboxylated sugars present on the cell surface) and mouse monoclonal antibody against Syndecan-1 (an integral membrane proteo- glycan). Results In control rats, the luminal surface of the glomerular endothelium appeared intensely stained for MMA lectin and Syndecan-1, indicating the presence of normal glycocalyx. Since its early phase (3 hours), sepsis induced a significant alteration in the glomerular endothelial glycocalyx, which worsened at later time points (7 and 15 hours). At 15 hours, disruption of the glomerular architecture was also present. Conclusions Alterations in endothelial glycocalyx may represent the first step of sepsis-related changes in permeability. It is likely that treatments aimed at preserving glycocalyx may also prevent not only the increase in permeability but possibly glomerular disruption.

P250 Electron microscopic renal tubular injury in endotoxemia C Ertmer1, S 1): P250 (doi: 10.1186/cc7414) Introduction Sepsis-associated renal failure is a common complication of septic shock. The current study investigates whether an innovative score of electron microscopic tubular injury (EMTI) is correlated with plasma creatinine concentration in ovine Twenty-nine awake healthy ewes received a continuous endotoxin infusion until the mean arterial pressure (MAP) fell below 65 mmHg. Thereafter, sheep were optimally volume-resuscitated and received norepinephrine to establish a MAP of 70 \u00b1 5 mmHg. After 12 hours animals were anesthetized and killed. Kidney tissue samples (10 per animal) were analyzed with standard transmission electron microscopy techniques. The EMTI score (0 to 12) was determined as the sum of (1) vacuolar cell degeneration (0 to 3), (2) basal membrane dissociation (0 to 3), (3) epithelial cell injury (0 to 3), and (4) luminal obstruction (0 to 3). The EMTI score was averaged as the mean value of the 10 kidney samples of each animal and was correlated with maximum plasma creatinine concentrations by Pearson product moment correlation. Results The EMTI score (median 5.9; 25% to 75% range 4.1 to significantly correlated with the plasma creatinine concen- tration (1.19; 1.06 0.371 ( P= 0.0476; Figure 1). Conclusions The EMTI score is useful to quantify alterations of renal tubular integrity and thereby reflects changes in renal function in ovine endotoxemia. Scientific use of the EMTI score may provide further insight into the pathophysiology of sepsis-associated renal failure. P251 Inflammation-induced renal injury subsides when endotoxin tolerance develops in humans as measured by urine proteomics A Draisma1, S Heemskerk2, M Bouw1, C der R 1Radboud University Medical Center, Nijmegen, the Netherlands; 2Nijmegen Centre for Molecular Life Sciences, Nijmegen, Netherlands Critical Care 2009, 13(Suppl 1): P251 (doi: 10.1186/cc7415) Introduction A prominent role of inflammatory mediators such as cytokines is increasingly recognized to play a prominent role in the development of renal injury during sepsis. Because of its high mortality rates, early detection of renal injury is of the utmost importance and the discovering of renal biomarkers seems promising in achieving this goal. Methods We induced endotoxin tolerance to accomplish an attenuated proinflammatory state by intravenous (abstract P250) S1042 ng/kg/day lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on 5 consecutive days in five healthy male volunteers. Renal function was monitored and urinary proteome research was performed before and after LPS administrations on days 1 and 5. Results Repeated LPS administrations induced an increase in serum creatinine of 11 \u00b1 3% ( P = 0.002) diminished glomerular filtration rate of 33 \u00b1 7% ( P = 0.02) on day 3, which was associated with the appearance of 15 peak intensities and an increase in 2-microglobulin levels ( P = 0.04) 6 hours after the first LPS administration. Four of the 15 peak intensities correlated 0.87, r2= 0.75, P= 0.05). During day 5 of the repeated LPS administrations, endotoxin tolerance developed and renal function was restored, reflected by serum creatinine levels of 70 \u00b1 6 mol/l (P= 0.2, day 1 compared with day 5) and by attenuated peak intensities on the urinary proteome profiles ( P<0.0001 for all measured 15 peak intensities) and 2-microglobulin levels comparable with baseline on the first day ( P= 0.35). Conclusions Renal injury occurs on day 3 during repeated endotoxemia, as adequately predicted by urinary proteome research on day 1. A significant correlation was found between four markers and the extent of renal injury, which may act as potential new biomarkers for renal injury at an early stage of inflammation. The inflammation-induced renal injury subsided when LPS tolerance developed after 5 consecutive days of LPS administrations.

Diagnosis of AKI relies on serum creatinine and urine flow. These have disadvantages of low specificity and sensitivity and a slow rate of change. Renal damage results in release of tubular enzymes into the urine. Measurement of urinary alpha glutathione S-transferase ( GST) and pi glutathione S-transferase ( GST) may indicate AKI more acutely and accurately than current methods of diagnosis. Methods Urine was collected from patients with a sepsis diagnosis 4 hourly over 48 hours. Urine was frozen, and urinary GST and GST measured. Fluid and vasopressor management was recorded, but managed independently. Serum creatinine was measured at 0, 24 and 48 hours. AKI was diagnosed using AKI Network criteria [1]. Results We present the first 35 patients recruited, 20 were male, 15 female. Median patient age was 53 years. Median APACHE II score was 13. Median ICU length of stay was 9 days. ICU mortality was 14%, hospital mortality 23%. AKI was diagnosed in 26% of patients. Statistical significance was tested by Wilcoxon signed- rank test. Although the median GST at 0 hours was elevated (11.8 g/l (non-AKI) versus 22 g/l (AKI)) this was not statistically significant between the two groups, P = 0.985. GST did not demonstrate an increased urinary level in AKI versus non-AKI (median values 0.89 g/l vs. 3.4 g/l at 0 hours). See Figure 1. Conclusions A trend towards early expression of GST was identifiable in this study. This may indicate early detection of AKI,which may help guide therapeutic interventions. GST does not seem to be released as a biomarker using this sepsis model, suggesting a more specific distal tubular injury. Further work is required to determine levels of GST in nonstressed kidneys.

P253 Plasma neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin is an early marker of acute kidney injury in critically ill patients: a prospective study J Constantin1, E Futier1, L Roszyk2, (doi: 10.1186/cc7417) Introduction Serum creatinine is a of acute kidney injury (AKI). Plasma neutrophil gelatinase (pNGAL) is an early biomarker of AKI after cardiac surgery. The purpose of this study was to assess the ability of pNGAL to predict AKI in ICU patients. Methods All patients admitted to three ICUs of the same institution were enrolled in this prospective observational study. pNGAL was analyzed at ICU admission. RIFLE criteria were calculated at admission and for each day during the first week. Patients were classified according to RIFLE criteria (RIFLE 0 or 1). Four groups were identified: RIFLE 0-0, 1-1, 1-0 and 0-1. Results During this 1-month period, 88 patients were included in the study. Thirty-six patients had RIFLE 0-0 with a mean pNGAL of 98 \u00b1 60 nmol/l. Twenty-two patients had RIFLE 1-1 with a mean pNGAL of 516 \u00b1 221 nmol/l. Twenty patients had no AKI at admission but developed AKI at 48 hours (24 to 96 hours) (RIFLE 0-1). In this case the mean pNGAL was 342 \u00b1 183 nmol/l. Ten patients had RIFLE 1-0 and the mean pNGAL was 169 \u00b1 100 nmol/l. With a cutoff value of 155 nmol/l, the sensibility and specificity to predict AKI were respectively 82% and 97%. Seven patients needed extrarenal therapy, all of them had pNGAL >155 nmo/l. The patients with pNGAL <155nmol/l had more shock, more sepsis and a higher Simplified Acute Physiology Score II score. Conclusions pNGAL at ICU admission is an early biomarker of AKI in a setting in which the timing of kidney injury is unknown. pNGAL increases 48 hours before RIFLE criteria.Critical Care March 2009 Vol 13 Suppl 1 29th International Symposium on Intensive Care and Emergency Medicine Figure 1 (abstract P252) S105P254 Plasma cholinesterase activity in patients during peritoneal dialysis L Popovic, A Pavicic, J Slavicek, J Kern Childrens Hospital Zagreb, Croatia Critical Care 2009, 13(Suppl 1): P254 (doi: 10.1186/cc7418) Introduction Literature data suggest that the release of nitric oxide (NO) by endothelial NO synthase contributes to functional alterations of the peritoneal membrane induced by acute perito- nitis. Experimental animal studies show that induced peritonitis was characterized by structural changes in the peritoneal membrane and increased permeability for urea and glucose, as well as increased protein loss in dialysate [1]. Plasma cholinesterase (PChE, 3.1.1.8) is an enzyme synthesized in the liver, molecular mass from 345,000 to 371,000 Da. The aim of this study was to evaluate the functional characteristics of the peritoneum, determining PChE transfer from blood to dialysis fluid in peritonitis- free patients and in patients with peritonitis. Methods We measured PChE activity in plasma and peritoneal dialysate in adult peritonitis-free patients ( n = 20) and in patients with peritonitis ( n = 12). For determination of PChE activity, vein blood samples were collected and stored at -20\u00b0C until analysed. PChE activity was determined by the spectrophotometric method of Ellman and colleagues [2], using butyryltiocholine as the substrate (Sigma Chemical Co., St Louis, MO, USA). Statistical analysis was made by Mann-Whitney U test and Wilcoxon matched-pairs test. Results In both groups of examined patients we detected the significant passage of PChE from blood to dialysis fluid (P= 0.000089 for peritonitis-free patients and P = 0.002218 for patients with peritonitis). The transperitoneal PChE passage degree is statistically unchanged in patients with peritonitis in relation to peritonitis-free patients ( P= 0.119438). Conclusions In all patients we detected significant transperitoneal passage of PChE during peritoneal dialysis. During human peritoneal dialysis there is no peritoneal permeability change for macromolecules such as PChE protein complex in patients with peritonitis. References 1.

Previous studies display the excellent predictive value of urine NGAL for AKI in a pediatric ICU setting [1,2]. Methods A prospective cohort study was conducted, including 63 patients. After ICU admission, plasma and urine samples were collec ted at eight time points. NGAL measurements were performed using an ELISA. The difference between the increase in NGAL and the increase in serum creatinine was calculated in relation to the time point at which maximum AKI was reached ( T= 0). AKI was defined according to Acute Kidney Injury Network definitions.Results Mean age (\u00b1SD) in years and APACHE II (\u00b1SD) scores for AKI I ( n= 22), II ( n= 21) and III patients ( n= 20) were respectively (56 \u00b1 18, 21 \u00b1 7), (58 \u00b1 19, 25 \u00b1 8) and (63 \u00b1 13, 27 \u00b1 7). In AKI III patients, the difference between the increase in plasma NGAL and the increase in serum creatinine expressed as a percentage (95% CI) at 72, 48 and 24 hours prior to maximum AKI was 203% (-169 to 574), -10% (-221 to 830) 155). For urine NGAL and serum creatinine the difference was respectively 584% (-603 to 1,770), 756% (12 to 1,499) and 726% (240 to 1,212). Figures 1 and 2 depict the increase in urine NGAL and serum creatinine separately and their difference in relation to T= 0. There was no positive difference in patients with AKI stages I and II for urine or plasma at any time point prior to maximum AKI. Conclusions NGAL is, compared with serum creatinine, an earlier predictor of AKI III, in a heterogeneous adult ICU population. Urine NGAL provides a larger and more sustained window of early prediction than plasma NGAL in patients with developing AKI III. The use of urine NGAL as an early predictive biomarker for AKI III is therefore promising in an adult heterogeneous ICU setting. References 1.

S106P256 Novel time series analysis approach for prediction of dialysis in critically ill patients using echo-state networks T Verplancke1, S Van Looy2, K Steurbaut2, D F De Introduction Echo-state networks are part of a group of reservoir computing methods and are basically a form of recurrent artificialneural networks. These methods can perform classification taskson time-series data. The recurrent artificial neural network of anecho-state network has an echo-state characteristic. This echostate functions as a fading memory: samples that have beenintroduced into the network in a further past are faded away. Theecho-state approach for the training of recurrent neural networkswas first described by Jaeger [1]. In clinical medicine, until thismoment, no original research articles have been published toexamine the use of echo-state networks.Methods The present study examines the possibility of using an echo-state network for prediction of dialysis in the ICU. Therefore,diuresis values and creatinine levels of the first 3 days after ICUadmission were collected from 830 patients admitted to the ICUbetween 31 May 2003 and 17 November 2007. The outcomeparameter was the performance by the echo-state network inpredicting the need for dialysis between day 5 and day 10 of ICUadmission. Patients with an ICU length of stay <10 days orpatients that received dialysis in the first 5 days of ICU admissionwere excluded. Performance by the echo-state network was thencompared by means of the area under the receiver operatingcharacteristic curve (AUC) with results obtained by two other time-series analysis methods by means of a support vector machine anda naive Bayes algorithm.Results The AUCs in the three developed echo-state networks were 0.822, 0.818, and 0.817. There were no statisticallysignificant differences at the 0.05 level with the results obtained bythe support vector machine and the naive Bayes algorithms.Conclusions This proof of concept study is the first to evaluate the performance of echo-state networks in predicting the need fordialysis in an ICU population. The AUCs of the echo-statenetworks were good and comparable with the performance ofother classification algorithms.Reference1. Jaeger H: The ing Recurrent Neural Networks. Technical Report GMD 148.

P257 Contrast-induced nephropathy: a prospective analysis of long-term outcome and persistence of renal impairment W Huber, E Wohlleb, C Schilling, B Saugel, V Phillip, acetylcysteine, theophylline and sodium-bicarbonate, contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) remains a clinical problem. Regardingthe large number of studies on CIN, little is known about long-termfollow up of patients with CIN. The aim of our study was thereforeto analyse the outcome of patients with CIN included in eightprospective studies on CIN conducted by our group, including more than 1,200 patients.Methods A systematic analysis of patients with CIN (defined as increase in serum creatinine 0.5 mg/dl and/or 25% within 48 hours after contrast-medium (CM)) using chart review and atelephone call to patients and to physicians involved in therapyafter CIN up to 1 year or up to death of the patient. Compositeprimary endpoint: requirement of renal replacement therapy (RRT),death, persistent increase in creatinine 0.3 mg/dl as compared with baseline value. Further endpoints: time course of creatinine upto 1 year after CM.Results Among 85 cases with CIN, complete datasets sufficient for analysis of the above-mentioned endpoints could be recordedin 55 patients. Thirty-nine male and 16 female patients; age85.5 \u00b1 13.1 of CM ml; intravenous CMapplication in 12 patients, intraarterial CM in 43 patients. The 28-day mortality was 8/55 (15%). At least four patients (7.3%) weretreated with RRT. A total of 24/55 patients (44%) fulfilled thecriteria of the composite endpoint (RRT or death or persistentincrease in creatinine 0.3 with baseline creatinine after hours (2.4 \u00b1 1.4 and 1 week (2.5 M 1.9 mg/dl; P= 0.033) were significantly elevated. In 37 of the surviving patients, creatinine after 1 year wasnot significantly higher than before CM (1.65 \u00b1 1.05 vs.1.46 \u00b1 0.76 mg/dl; P= 0.1). However, patients who died or were on RRT were not included in this comparison. In two of our eightstudies CIN was significantly associated with mortality.Conclusions Our data indicate that CIN is associated with signifi- cant mortality, requirement of RRT and/or persistent renal impair-ment in nearly one-half of the patients. Since these data werecollected in patients included in studies aimed at prophylaxis ofCIN, the risk might be even more elevated in clinical routine. Prophy-laxis of CIN should therefore be a major issue in patients at risk.

Early andaggressive management of renal dysfunction through intermittentor continuous renal replacement therapy (RRT) is now commonpractice. The objective of this study was to review the outcome ofpatients who received RRT in the multidisciplinary ICU of theJohannesburg Hospital, South Africa.Methods A review of ICU records between January 2003 and December 2004 of all patients requiring RRT in the ICU wasperformed. Demographic data, reason for ICU admission, presenceof comorbidity, APACHE II score, the modality and duration ofdialysis, as well as the outcome in the ICU were documented. Thisstudy was approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee ofthe University of the Witwatersrand, and statistical analysis carriedout in conjunction with the Biostatistics Unit of the MedicalResearch Council of South Africa using the Stata release 8.0statistical package.Results One hundred and fifty-six patients out of 2,200 admis- sions (January 2003 to December 2004) were initiated on RRT.One hundred and three patients were treated with intermittenthaemodialysis (IHD), 47 of whom died (45.6%). Twenty-threeCritical Care March 2009 Vol 13 Suppl 1 29th International Symposium on Intensive Care and Emergency MedicineS107patients underwent continuous venovenous haemodialysis, 20 (87%) of whom died. patients IHDand continuous venovenous haemodialysis, 15 (68.2%) of whomdied. In eight patients there was no record of the mode of dialysisadministered. Multivariate logistic regression suggested that themain factor associated with mortality was dialysis. Omitting themode of dialysis, the presence of sepsis and the use of inotropeswere independent risk factors associated with mortality.Conclusions Continuous RRT allows renal support in patients who would be unable to sustain IHD. The presence of sepsis and theuse of inotropic support, rather than the mode of dialysis, arepredictive of the outcome of ARF in the ICU. Of note, the overallmortality rate for ARF in this study appears to be lower thanpreviously reported.References1. de Mendonica A, Vincent JL, Suter PM, et al. : Acute renal failure in the ICU: risk factors and outcome evaluation bySOFA score.

Creatinine in the week prior to ICU admission,creatinine at ICU consultation and peak creatinine in the 2 weeksafter ICU admission were recorded.Results Eighty-five patients were included, of which 40% achieved all goals within 6 hours (early achievement), whereas 33% did notbut had all of them documented within the first 12 hours (noachievement), 27% had incomplete documentation of goals. Forty-four out of 85 patients (52%) developed acute kidney injury (AKI)according to the RIFLE criteria. Patients with incomplete docu-mentation, early or no achievement of goals were comparable atbaseline, APACHE II and interventions except for more use ofinotropes in the no achievement group. The course of creatinine inpatients was similar, regardless of achievement of goals: baseline -ICU consultation - peak, presented as median (IQR): earlyachievement group: 90 (61 to 119) - 118 (86 to 204) - 148 (86to 249); no achievement group: 76 (56 to 98) - 121 (78 to 159) -151 (88 to 205); incomplete documentation group: 81 (56 to 109) -95 (65 to 175) - 114 (77 to 223). The patients that developed AKIhad a significant increase in creatinine from baseline to the time ofICU consultation: baseline - ICU consultation - peak, presentedas median (IQR): no AKI: 75 (59 to 114) - 87 (64 to 123) - 92(72 to 129); AKI: 84 (61 to 105), P = 0.638 - 145 (102 to 205), P <0.001 - 196 (153 to 276), P <0.001. The development of AKI was independent of achievement of physiologic goals ofresuscitation.Conclusions In septic patients admitted from the ward there is no association between the development of AKI and the timeliness ofachievement of physiologic resuscitation goals. In view of thehigher creatinine values measured at ICU admission in the patientsthat eventually suffer from AKI, it appears that the insult hasoccurred prior to the time of ICU consultation and that physiologicresuscitation does not reverse it. P260 Is goal-directed therapy useful in kidney transplantation? M Ciapetti, S Di Valvasone, M Bonizzoli, A Di Filippo, A 10.1186/cc7424) Introduction Patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) are entitled to the kidney transplantation approach at surgery withvarious modifications of the volemic status. According to somestudies [1,2], acute tubular necrosis risk can be reduced bykeeping a correct intravascular volume before graft reperfusion.The aim of this study was to evaluate goal-directed therapy in theearly postoperative period in kidney transplantation.Methods We observed 50 kidney transplant recipients divided into two groups: 38 patients (Group A) underwent central oxygenvenous saturation (ScVO 2) monitoring, and 12 patients (Group B) were controls. Continuous central venous pressure (CVP) andScVO 2were monitored the in ICU [3]. In Group A the volemic status by keeping CVP >5 mmHg and ScVO2>70% was optimized. We collected donors' and transplant patients' kidneyparameters (age, sex, death cause, ischaemia time), recipients'parameters (age, sex, weight, height, BMI, duration of dialysis,ESRD, Simplified Acute Physiology Score II), intraoperativeparameters (metabolic, respiratory and hemodynamic), hemo-dynamic and kidney functioning parameters in the ICU (heart rate,mean arterial pressure, CVP, ScVO 2, lactate, diuresis, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, fluid balance), and outcome parameters(ICU length of stay, acute rejection at 28 days, mortality at6 months).Results At each observation ScVO 2was >70% in all patients of Group A. Diuresis was higher in Group A (at 6 hours, Group A:1,082.6 \u00b1 1,000.7; (Group 2; B: 8.2 7.2 \u00b1 2.5; Group B: 9.3\u00b1 0.07) and BUN 0 Group A: 0.9 \u00b1 0.4; Group B: 1.0 \u00b10.3; \u00b1 0.4; Group B: 1.1 \u00b1 B: 0.1 \u00b1 0.04)reduction (12 to 0 hours) was higher in Group A. Diureticstimulation was reduced in 10 patients of Group A and zero ofGroup B ( P <0.05) and was interrupted in eight patients of Group A and two of Group B.Conclusions Postoperative intensive monitoring and optimization of intravascular volume by CVP and ScVO 2grant fast recovery of kidney functioning in transplant recipients, so reducing diureticstimulation, creatinine and BUN values.References1.

Sepsis is the most common cause of AKI resulting inworse clinical outcomes when compared with other causes [2].Methods An observational study conducted in a medical ICU of a general hospital in Singapore over a 6-month period. Patients whowere admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of sepsis and AKI (asdefined by the AKIN criteria) were prospectively enrolled. Theclinical characteristics and outcomes were determined andstratified according to the AKIN criteria.Results A total of 71 consecutive septic patients (60.6% Chinese, 32.4% Malays, 2.8% Indians) were enrolled. The mean age was63.7 years with a male predominance of 67.6%. The medianSimplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS) II score was 54. Themajority (60.6%) was AKI III, with 22.9% in stage II and 16.9% instage I. Overall hospital mortality was 39.4%. Patients who metseptic AKI III had significantly higher mortality compared with AKI Iand II (55.8% vs. 16.7% and 12.5%, respectively, P<0.001). There was a significant difference in the mean SAPS II scorebetween the dead and alive patients (70 vs. 46, P <0.001). Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that AKI III (OR =5.75, 95% CI = 1.2 to 25.5) and SAPS II score 65 (OR = 15.6, 95% CI = 3.5 to 68.2) were found to be independent predictors ofhospital mortality.Conclusions In septic patients, AKI III appeared to be a strong predictor of hospital mortality. This finding is similar to a previousstudy [3], which also showed that in patents with AKI only AKI IIIwas an independent risk factor for hospital death.References1.

P262 Incidence and outcome of acute renal failure necessitating renal replacement therapy after trauma S Beitland1, H Moen1, I Os2 1Ullevaal University Hospital, 13(Suppl 1): P262 (doi: 10.1186/cc7426) Introduction Acute renal failure (ARF) requiring renal replacement therapy (RRT) is uncommon in trauma patients. The aim of thisstudy was to assess incidence and outcome in this patient group.Methods Adult trauma patients with ARF treated with RRT at Ullevaal University Hospital between 1 January 1996 and 31December 2007 were retrospectively reviewed. The hospital is theregional trauma referral centre for approximately 1.93 million adult (>18 years) persons. Individuals were identified and data werecollected using several institutional registries in addition to theNorwegian renal registry. Patients were grouped according topresence of rhabdomyolysis based on peak serum creatine kinaselevels exceeding 10,000 U/l or not. Categorical data werecompared employing the two-sided Pearson chi-square test,whereas continuous data were compared utilizing the two-tailedMann-Whitney U test.Results There were 78,345 hospital admissions due to trauma during the study period, 42 of these underwent RRT for ARF (afterexcluding one person due to low age, three with nonrenalindications for RRT and another three with chronic renal failure).The incidence rate of post-traumatic ARF requiring RRT was0.54, and was higher in males compared with females (33.72vs. 6.05 per million persons, P <0.01). The patients' age was median (range) 46.4 (18 to 84) years, and 85.7% were males.Mortality rates were 23.8% (ICU/hospital), 35.7% (3 months) and40.5% (1 year). Renal recovery, defined as independency fromRRT, occurred in all survivors after 3 months and 1 year.Rhabdomyolysis was present in 18 persons (42.9%) and was onlyregistered in males. Trauma patients with rhabdomyolysis weresignificantly younger (33.0 vs. 57.0 years, P = 0.01), needed RRT earlier (3.0 vs. 6.5 days, P = 0.02) and had lower 3-month (16.7 vs. 50.0%, P = 0.03) and 1-year (22.2 vs. 54.2%, P = 0.04) mortality rates compared with nonrhabdomyolytic persons.Conclusions Post-traumatic ARF requiring RRT is rare and mainly affects males of young age. There is still a considerable mortalityrate in these patients, and it seems that rhabdomyolytic personshave a more favourable outcome compared with those withoutrhabdomyolysis. Among survivors, recovery of renal function isoften seen, and few become dependent on chronic RRT.

The Case Mix Programme Database wasinterrogated and data extracted from 22,313 admissions to eightICUs from 1999 to 2007. The presence of AKI was assessedwithin the first 24 hours after admission (early AKI) and classifiedaccording to the RIFLE criteria. Trends over time were describedfor the RIFLE categories, and outcomes of admissions in eachcategory were summarised. Where available, information on theuse of renal replacement therapy during the ICU stay wasanalysed.Results Trends in early AKI changed little over time: 35.5% of patients sustained AKI (risk 13.5%, injury 11.1%, failure 9.8%,end-stage 1.2%) and 9% of patients received renal replacementtherapy. Outcomes are presented in Table 1.Conclusions For the first time we have established the incidence of early AKI using the RIFLE criteria in Northern Ireland ICUs. ThisCritical Care March 2009 Vol 13 Suppl 1 29th International Symposium on Intensive Care and Emergency MedicineS109will inform renal service development in ICUs.

P264 RIFLE classification can predict hospital mortality of critically College Hospital, Beijing, China; 2First Affiliated Hospital of Henan College of Traditional ChinaCritical Care 2009, 13(Suppl 1): P264 (doi: 10.1186/cc7428) Introduction The Acute Dialysis Quality Initiative group has proposed the RIFLE (Risk-Injury-Failure-Loss-End-stage renaldisease) classification to assess acute kidney injury (AKI). Wesought to evaluate the incidence of AKI in critically ill patientsaccording to the RIFLE classification and the correlation betweenRIFLE class and hospital mortality.Methods We performed a retrospective cohort study applying the RIFLE classification on 1,138 patients admitted to the ICU during a2-year period.Results According to the RIFLE classification, 376 patients (33%) had AKI during their ICU stay. When assessing the maximumRIFLE class, 209 (18.3%) patients were classified Risk, 63 (5.5%)as Injury and 104 (6.3%) as Failure. Female (OR 95% CI 1.01 to 1.70; P= 0.039), APACHE II on admission above 25 (OR = 1.99; 95% CI = 1.06 to 3.76; P= 0.033), sepsis on admission (OR = 2.20; 95% CI = 1.01 to 4.79; P= 0.046) and chronic organ dysfunction (OR = 1.65; 95% CI = 1.09 to 2.50;P= 0.017) were independent risk factors for AKI. Patients with progressive RIFLE classification had increased hospital mortality,with Risk 13.9%, Injury 22.2% and Failure 47%, as compared with7.9% ( P< 0.001) among patients without AKI. Furthermore, the RIFLE class Failure was an independent predictor of 3-monthhospital mortality (OR = 2.37; 95% CI = 1.23 to 4.54; P= 0.009) in addition to organ failure on admission (OR = 4.60; 95% CI =2.31 to 9.18; P<0.001), use of CI = 1.09 to 5.00; P= 0.028), and APACHE II score on admission (OR = 1.160; 95% CI = 1.11 to 1.21; P< 0.001). Conclusions Patients with increasing RIFLE classification had significant elevated hospital mortality. Maximum RIFLE class Failurewas independently associated with 3-month hospital mortality.References1.

Burn injury severity was estimated using thetotal body surface area burn (TBSA%), severity of illness wasestimated using the Pediatric Risk of Mortality (PRISM) score. ThepRIFLE criteria were applied and the patients were assigned to theappropriate pRIFLE stratum (Risk, Injury, Failure) if they fulfilledeither estimated creatinine clearance, urine output criteria, or both.Results The incidence of AKI was 40.7%, maximum RIFLE class Risk, class Injury and class Failure occurred in 50%, 36% and18%, respectively. Patients with maximum RIFLE class Risk, Injuryand Failure had ICU mortality rates of 0%, 5.6% and 57.1%,respectively, compared with 1.4% for patients without AKI. Weobserved statistically significant differences between the patientswith AKI and those without AKI in the following parameters: TBSA(41.2 \u00b1 17.7% 6.4 vs. 4.8 \u00b1 3.4, P <0.01), number of surgical procedures (3.7 \u00b1 2.9 vs. 1.5 \u00b1 1.5, P <0.001), occurrence of abdominal compartment syndrome (18% vs. 0%, P <0.001), length of mechanical ventilation (22.3 \u00b1 27.6 days vs. 7.1 \u00b1 11.4 days,P<0.001) and length of ICU stay (37 \u00b1 30.1 days vs. 14.6 \u00b1 13.9 days, P <0.001). Logistic regression analysis indicated that PRISM score (OR = 1.1, 95% CI = 1.0 to 1.2; P = 0.05) and TBSA (OR = 1.06, 95% CI = 1.0 to 1.1; P <0.001) were independent risk factors for AKI in pediatric burn patients.Conclusions AKI estimated by pRIFLE criteria occurs in major pediatric burns, and failure was associated with increasedmortality. Patients with AKI had higher admission burn and illnessseverity, increased incidence of abdominal compartment syn-drome, more operations, and had increased duration of mechanicalventilation and length of ICU stay. AKI is a marker of increasedresource utilization and risk for adverse outcomes after burn injuryin children.Available online http://ccforum.com/supplements/13/S1 Table 1 (abstract mortality 1,350 (9.4) 563 (18.6) 834 (33.8) 909 (41.6) 48 (18.5) Hospital mortality 2,258 (16.8) 900 (31.9) 1,092 (47.2) 1,137 (55.9) 82 (32.7) Data presented as n Extracorporeal renal replacement therapy in patients with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia M Bekers-Anchipolovskis, V Liguts, E L Semcenko, M 1): (doi: 10.1186/cc7430) Introduction renal in heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) patients, usingthe alternative anticoagulant bivalirudin. A decreased platelet count(PC) is often seen after cardiopulmonary bypass with PC reductionby about 30% to 50%, correlating with the duration of cardio-pulmonary bypass. However, only a few of these patients willdevelop HIT. Acute renal failure (ARF), followed by extracorporealRRT, was seen in 90% of the patients with critical PC reductionfound in the postoperative ICU. ARF has multiple etiology: baselinedisorders (congestive heart failure, acute heart failure), hypoxemia,drugs used during surgery, and so on. The significance of post-operative thrombocytopenia, including HIT, urges to differentiate itscauses and select appropriate patient care options, including useof alternative anticoagulants, namely bivalirudin. Bivalirudin (Angio-max; The Medicines Company, Cambridge, MA, USA) is asynthetic hirudin analog, which reversibly binds serum half-life is 25 minutes in patients withnormal renal function, while it is longer in those with renaldysfunction (3.5 hours).Methods A retrospective study in HIT patients (clinical scoring and laboratory assays) who underwent RRT.Results Ten patients were studied, thereof four patients had low PC, thrombotic complications, RRT and prolonged duration of stayin the ICU - 17 days on average. Two of the patients had positivetests (ranged from 0.45 to 1.62) on postoperative days 6 to 8 and11 to 12. All of the patients had their anticoagulant switched fromheparin to bivalirudin, despite implanted circulation assistingdevices and RRT. Coagulation system status was evaluated by theactivated partial thromboplastin time, of which target value wastwice the upper normal range. The bivalirudin infusion dose rangedfrom 50 /kg/hour to 100 /kg/hour, depending on the activated partial thromboplastin time value. Bivalirudin was found to be atleast as safe and effective an anticoagulant as heparin.Conclusions HIT patients must be switched from heparin to alternative anticoagulant. Bivalirudin is a safe and effective anti-coagulant for extracorporeal RRT; however, the dose should beadjusted individually. Bivalirudin has prolonged effect in ARFpatients and does not have antagonists. P267 Coagulopathy of liver disease does not increase the filter life during continuous renal replacement therapy B Agarwal, S Shaw, M Hari Royal Free Hospital, London, UKCritical Care 2009, 13(Suppl 1): P267 (doi: 10.1186/cc7431) Introduction Clotting of haemofiltration circuits is a limiting factor in achieving efficient continuous renal replacement therapy(CRRT), yet systemic anticoagulation risks haemorrhage. Somepatients, such as those with liver failure, are traditionally managedwith no or minimal anticoagulation, because of abnormal clottingtests and therefore increased perceived risk of bleeding [1].Methods We retrospectively reviewed the CRRT circuit life in three groups of liver failure patients (acute liver failure (ALF), acuteon chronic liver failure (ACLF) and postelective liver transplantation (LTx)), with two control groups (systemic sepsis (SS) and haema-tological malignancy (Haem)), admitted to the Royal Free HospitalICU - a tertiary referral centre for liver disease and transplantation -between 2003 and 2007. Ten consecutive patients in each of thefive groups were included in the study if they had renal failure andrequired continuous haemofiltration (CRRT) for more than48 hours.Results The mean CRRT circuit life was significantly greater in the Haem group, compared with the others; 28.5 \u00b1 25.7 hours, versus11 \u00b1 10.5 ALF, 11.6 6.6 and 9.9 \u00b1 5.9 SS,P <0.05, with the Haem group requiring fewest new CCRT circuits within 48 hours; 2.7 \u00b1 1.5 versus 4.3 \u00b1 1.3 ALF, 4.2 \u00b1 2.1 ACLF,5.3 \u00b1 1.5 LTx and 4.6 \u00b1 1.5 SS, P <0.05 and least blood transfusions; 1.4 \u00b1 1.3 versus 4.8 \u00b1 4.2 ALF, 4.2 \u00b1 4.1 ACLF,2.2 \u00b1 2.1 LTx and 3.2 \u00b1 1.2 Transmembrane pressures werehigher in those CRRT circuits that clotted due to the filter,compared with other causes, such as access dysfunction (123 \u00b174 vs. 71.8 \u00b1 29.3 mmHg, P = 0.009). In those patients where anticoagulation was started due to repeated filter clotting, theCRRT circuit life improved from 5.6 \u00b1 3.4 to 19 \u00b1 12.7 hours,P<0.01. Conclusions Despite abnormal standard laboratory coagulation tests and thrombocytopenia, CRRT circuits clot frequently in liverfailure patients. Anticoagulation did improve CRRT circuit survivalwithout an obvious increase in bleeding or blood transfusionrequirement. Anticoagulation should therefore be considered inthese patients in cases of repeated circuit clotting.Reference1. Davenport A: CRRT in the management of patients with liver disease.

P268 Optimal dose of renal replacement therapy in acute kidney injury: a meta-analysis RJ Van Wert, DC Scales, JO Friedrich, R Wald, NK Adhikari University of Toronto, ON, CanadaCritical Care 2009, 13(Suppl 1): P268 (doi: 10.1186/cc7432) Introduction Acute kidney injury (AKI) requiring renal replacement therapy (RRT) increases mortality in the critically ill patient. Ourobjective was to systematically review randomized controlled trials(RCTs) examining the effect of the RRT dose on mortality.Methods In duplicate, we searched Medline, EMBASE and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from inception toDecember 2008, using terms for all RRT modalities, AKI, andRCTs. Included RCTs compared different doses of (effluent rate in continuous week in intermittent hemodialysis (IHD)) in patientswith AKI, and reported mortality or dialysis dependence. Weexcluded RCTs that evaluated very high volume hemofiltration(continuous effluent rates >60 ml/kg/hour). Risk ratios (RRs) with95% confidence intervals for mortality and dialysis dependenceamong survivors were calculated using random-effects models(RevMan 5). We investigated subgroup effects by modality (CRRTvs. IHD) and patient group (septic citations, seven RCTs ( n= 2,255) met the inclusion Four (35 to 48 vs.20 ml/kg/hour); two RCTs used IHD RCTs weregenerally Meta-analysis not demonstratereduced mortality with high-dose RRT (RR = 0.86, 0.70 to 1.06).The effect was similar in patients (1) treated with CRRT (RR =Critical Care March 2009 Vol 13 Suppl 1 29th International Symposium on Intensive Care and Emergency MedicineS1110.87, 0.71 to 1.06, five trials, n= 1,552) and IHD (RR = 0.95, 0.59 to 1.51, three trials, n= 703), and (2) with sepsis (RR = 1.08, 0.96 to 1.22, n= 896) and without sepsis (RR = 0.88, 0.65 to 1.20, n= 959) in the four trials with these data. High-dose RRT did not decrease dialysis dependence among all survivors (RR = 1.09, 0.83 to 1.43, five trials, n= 774) or in the subgroup treated only with CRRT (RR = 1.27, 0.62 to 2.59, three trials, n= 233). We estimate that if the ongoing multicentre RENAL n= 1,500, ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00221013) of high-dose versus standard-dose CRRT demonstrates the expected absolute mortality risk reduction (from 60% to 52%), the pooled mortality benefit would just reach statistical significance. Conclusions Current evidence does not demonstrate reduced mortality with high-dose RRT for AKI, even in the subgroup of patients with sepsis-associated AKI. Forthcoming results of the RENAL trial may contribute to more definitive results. P269 Removal of inflammatory mediators by continuous renal replacement therapy in severe sepsis E Tomas1, E Lafuente1, B Vera1, M Fernandes1, 1): P269 (doi: 10.1186/cc7433) Introduction The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) in systemic inflam- matory mediator removal in a group of patients with severe sepsis/septic shock and related renal failure. Methods We conducted a prospective study, approved by the ethics committee, enrolling 11 patients with severe sepsis/septic shock under CRRT. We measured the cytokines using the immunoassay method. The cytokine measurement was done every morning until the end of renal support. We analyzed the following data: age, severity scores (Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS) II, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA)), ultrafiltrate samples. We correlated these data with filter duration, considering 24 hours as the maximum theoretical limit for effective cytokine removal. Results From the 11 patients enrolled, we collected 420 valid samples to measure the cytokine levels. The mean age and SAPS II were respectively 66 \u00b1 10.7 years and 46 \u00b1 27.1. The mean totalSOFA score at admission and at day 3 were 11.2 \u00b1 4 and 12.7 \u00b1 4 respectively, with SOFA = +1.3 points ( P >0.05). The mean ICU hospitalization time was 25.9 \u00b1 33.5 days. We have done 876 hours of dialytic therapy; 33 AN69 membranes were used, during a mean time of 26.5 \u00b1 25.6 hours. The mean total levels found for cytokines are presented in Figure 1 and the levels depending on the filter duration are in Figure 2. The ICU mortality was 54.6%. Conclusions The present study does not allow us to define a specific pattern for the removal of inflammatory mediators related to CRRT. We observed a trend for cytokine reduction dependent on filter duration with the higher efficacy removal until 24 hours. The cytokine level found in the effluent does not reflect the absolute reduction found in post-filter, and this effect could be dependent on adsorption, according to other studies [1,2].

P270 Blood epuration of molecules in continuous venovenous with regional citrate anticoagulation versus (doi: 10.1186/cc7434) Introduction Adequate anticoagulation is a precondition to improve blood epuration. In a prospective crossover trial, we compared the removal of middle molecules in continuous renal replacement therapy, by two methods that used either trisodium citrate ACD (BRAUN Laboratories) or heparin as anticoagulation. Methods Fourteen critically ill patients were treated by continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration. The dialysate and hemofiltration flows were 1,500 ml/hour each. All patients received two sessions of 36 hours successively. Patients 1 to 7 received systemic heparinization first, then regional anticoagulation by citrate. Conversely, Patients 8 to 14 received heparin and then citrate. Every 12 hours during each session of renal replacement (T0, T12, T24 and T36), blood epuration of creatinine) and middle molecules ( 2-microglobulin, retinol binding protein) were evaluated from blood and effluent samples. Results At all time periods, there was no significant difference in creatinine and urea clearances between citrate and heparin treatment, except in T12 where creatinine clearance was signifi- cantly higher when than using \u00b1 4.0 ml/min vs. 34 \u00b1 4.1 ml/min, P = 0.02). We did not observe a significant decline of urea and creatinine clearance during the session. The retinol binding protein blood and effluent rates were limited and stable during the session. Between T0 and T12, results showed a significant improvement of 2-microglobulin clearance with using citrate or heparin. After T12, 2-microglobulin clearance decreased with citrate treatment and stayed stable with heparin. Clearance seems to be higher with citrate than heparin, however, with only a significant difference in T12 (20.1 \u00b1 4.0 vs. 16.3 \u00b1 3.1 ml/min, P Undergoing citrate treatment, we recorded significant metabolic alkalosis ( P = 0.0025) but without hypernatremia.Available online http://ccforum.com/supplements/13/S1 Figure 1 (abstract P269) Total cytokine levels.

P271 Utilization of slow low-efficiency dialysis may help to optimize the need for continuous renal replacement therapy in Indian ICUs A Majumdar, S Basu, M Bhattacharya, M Kharbanda, P Sinha, 1): P271 (doi: 10.1186/cc7435) Introduction The aim was to study the practice pattern of using the modern modalities of renal replacement therapy (RRT) (slow low-efficiency dialysis (SLED) and continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT)) in hemodynamically unstable critically ill patients in an Indian ICU. Methods A retrospective observational study of hemodynamically unstable patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) who needed RRT in ICUs of a tertiary-care hospital. All patients who underwent SLED and/or CRRT from September 2005 to April 2008 were taken up for analysis. To maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) >70 mmHg, patients who required noradrenaline >0.5 g/kg/minute were treated with CRRT whereas those requiring 0.5 g/kg/minute received SLED. Depending on haemodynamic stability patients were switched from CRRT to SLED, or vice versa . Results From September 2005 to April 2008, 214 haemo- dynamically unstable AKI patients, deemed unfit for (continuous venovenous hemofiltration patients were switched to SLED after a median 48 hours of CRRT. See Figures 1 and 2. Conclusions In our ICU, the need for RRT in hemodynamically unstable patients with AKI was significantly higher in the medical patients, the commonest cause of AKI being sepsis. Patients whowere equally sick (comparable APACHE II scores) could be effectively dialysed by SLED, as compared with CRRT. Hemodynamic stability was maintained in the patients on SLED, as none needed switchover to CRRT. The patients undergoing SLED were dialysed during daytime by the haemodialysis nurse, eliminating the need for a specialist nurse in the night. After a median 48 hours of CRRT, it was possible to switch to SLED, resulting in optimal utilization of resources. SLED was much cheaper than CRRT. In a country like India where often there are economical constraints, the judicious use of SLED will help us optimize the need for CRRT. P272 Observational cohort of renal replacement therapy patients at a district general hospital ICU: case mix and outcomes C Hayes-Bradley, S Caddel, J Paddle Royal Cornwall Hospital, Truro, UK Critical Care 2009, 13(Suppl 1): P272 (doi: 10.1186/cc7436) Introduction Previous studies have shown the mortality of ICU patients requiring renal replacement therapy (RRT) to be high at 62.8% [1], and underpredicted by APACHE II scoring [2]. The ICNARC Case Mix Programme gives mortality of 59.5% for 2003 to 2004. We aimed to review our patients to see how we compare. Methods We prospectively collected data on all RRT episodes on the ICU from 2005 to 2007: patient age, APACHE II score in the first 24 hours, primary indication for RRT, RIFLE classification at start of RRT, ICU and hospital length of stay (LOS), mortality at 30, 60, and 90 days, and recovery of renal function at 30 days. Results We admitted 1,557 patients over the 3-year study period, of which 18% were elective. A total of 210 patients received RRT (data were available on 208). The median age was 66 years, 56% were male, and mean APACHE II score was 25.4. Our hospital mortality for all patients receiving RRT was 50.5%. One hundred and seventy-six patients had RRT for acute kidney injury with a hospital mortality of 51.1% (23 class Risk patients, 70 class Injury, 83 class Failure). No statistical difference in hospital mortality, ICU LOS, or renal function recovery existed by RIFLE class. By APACHE II score, the standardised mortality ratio was 0.98 (1.1 in 2005, 0.97 in 2006, and 0.86 in 2007). Main indications for filtration hyperkalaemia <1%. The average ICU LOS was 9 days for hospital survivors (IQR 5 to 21 days) and 4 days in nonsurvivors (IQR 2 to 8 days). Only three hospital survivors were not alive at 90 days. Three out of 82 followed-up patients still required dialysis at 30 days. Conclusions Our hospital mortality compares favourably with other published work [1,3]. We found the APACHE II score to predict mortality accurately, in contrast to published work showing underprediction [2]. This may represent a better outcome in our cohort. We were unable to demonstrate a correlation between the RIFLE score at initiation of RRT and hospital mortality. This could be due to small numbers, or to an equivalence of outcome for the RIFLE classes once RRT is established. References 1.

Little attention has been paid to the potential adverseeffects of CRRT related to extracorporeal circuit bioincompatibility.Limited available evidence suggests that intermittent dialysis maycompromise hepatosplanchnic perfusion in acute renal failurepatients. By contrast, there are no data on the bio(in)compatibilityindices in patients treated by CRRT. To investigate this issue, weutilized a long-term porcine model allowing a broad insight intoorgan hemodynamic, microvascular, metabolic and other pathwaysnot accessible in human medicine.Methods Measurements were performed in 11 healthy instru- mented animals. After baseline measurements, animals wererandomized to receive either no treatment ( n= 6) or continuous venovenous hemofiltration with a polysuphon membrane (CVVH,n= 5). Further data were collected at 6 and 10 hours after the randomization. During each time point the following data related to(1) organ perfusion (hepatosplanchnic and renal blood flows), laser Dopplerflowmetry and (3) energy dimethylarginine)were collected.Results Hemofiltration affected neither regional mucosal and renal cortex microvascular perfusion. Nochanges in liver and kidney oxygen exchange and energy balancewere detected during the 10-hour treatment. Similarly, CVVH didnot interfere with surrogate markers of inflammation, oxidative/nitrosative stress and endothelial dysfunction.Conclusions In our model CVVH utilizing a modern biocompatible polysulphon membrane did not induce any significant deleteriouseffects in various biological systems. The importance of ourfindings lies in the fact that any changes in the studied parameters,if observed in future studies, cannot be attributed to the effects ofputative extracorporeal circuit bioincompatibility. Finally, our datasupport the postulated concept of good biological tolerance ofCRRT.Acknowledgement Supported by MSM 0021620819 - Replace- ment of and support to some vital organs.P274 Influence of continuous venovenous hemofiltration on transpulmonary thermodilution-derived Neirynck, hemofiltration (CVVH) on transpulmonary hemodynamic para-meters in nine ventilated patients [1,2].Methods All together 32 calibrations were performed with and without CVVH treatment. For each calibration three consecutiveinjections of 20 ml cold saline were done via the central venousline (CVL), giving a total of 186 thermodilutions.Results Patient age was 72.3 \u00b1 14, BMI 24.7 \u00b1 3.8, SAPS II 56.2 15.7. Regardless of the catheter position, CVVH increased theextravascular lung water index (EVLWi) from 11.3 \u00b1 5 to 12.4 \u00b16.3 (P = NS), while the cardiac index (CI) and global end-diastolic volume index (GEDVi) decreased from 5.1 \u00b1 1.8 to 4.2 \u00b1 1.3(P= 0.03) and from 1036 \u00b1 298 to 885 \u00b1 185 ( P= 0.02), respectively. The results of a subanalysis comparing correctcatheter position (CVL placed in jugular or subclavian vein anddialysis catheter placed femorally) and faulty position (dialysiscatheter positioned between the thermodilution injection anddetection sites) are summarized in Table 1. In two patientscatheters were exchanged during the stay from the faulty to thecorrect position, and this resulted in a significant decrease in allparameters: CI dropped from 6.1 \u00b1 0.9 to 5 \u00b1 0.3 ( P = and EVLWi from 16.1 \u00b1 7.1 to 8.7 \u00b1 1.2 ( P = 0.03). Conclusions In critically ill patients treated with CVVH, the hemodynamic parameters obtained by PiCCO transpulmonarythermodilution can be influenced: EVLWi increases while CI andGEDVi drop. We hypothesize that this may be due to the positionof the CVL and dialysis catheters.References1.

Antibiotic dosing for septic patients with acute renal failure receiving continuous renal replacement therapy is complicated, and failure to correctly dose may result in either drug toxicity, or treatment failure and development of resistance [1]. Methods A dataset was established of the minimal number of parameters that need be reported when calculating a drug-dosing regimen. Patient demographics and markers of severity were added to allow for patient population comparisons. A Medline search was performed of the relevant literature, producing 76 studies from which completeness of the dataset was examined. Results None of the studies analysed presented the full dataset that we established as necessary (Figure 1). Of concern, basic pharmacokinetic parameters such as the volume of distribution and clearance were absent in a significant number of studies effectively abrogating calculation of a meaningful dosing regimen. Conclusions A large proportion of current studies do not report key information necessary to devise a rational dosing regimen for patients with acute renal failure receiving continuous renal replacement therapy. We have presented a set of criteria we believe are necessary to calculate an antibiotic-dosing regimen for these patients and hope this will be a useful guide when reporting future pharmacokinetic data.

The aim of the study is to determine the time course of adsorption of gentamicin to a polyacrylonitrile filter (PAN) and a polyamide filter, respectively. Methods A unit of expired whole blood was mixed with heparinized lactated Ringer's solution to made up a total volume of 1,000 ml. Five hundred milliliters of this blood-crystalloid mixture was taken to a glass chamber where it was agitated and heated. After the equilibration period, 20% of a standard dose of the drug was infused into the mixing chamber. The blood-crystalloid mixture was then circulated through an in vitro continuous venovenous hemofiltration model. The ultrafiltrate was returned to the mixing chamber and no replacement fluid was infused. As a result, any decrease in drug concentration could only occur due to adsorp- tion. Samples were taken from the mixing chamber for measure- ment of the drug concentration. At 90 minutes, the remaining 500 ml blood-crystalloid mixture will then be added to the mixing chamber. Samples were taken again after another hour. If the fall in drug concentration was less than those predicted from the dilution effect following the increase in blood-crystalloid volume, it indicates reversibility of adsorption. A second dose of drug was then added and samples were taken afterwards. Adsorption of antibiotic before and after the second dose was compared. Two types of filter, namely a 0.6 m2PAN hemofilter (Multiflow 6S; Gambro), were used in the study and four batches of tests were repeated for each hemofilter. Results Drug adsorption by PAN hemofilters was significant, whereas drug adsorption by polyamide hemofilters was much lower compared with that of PAN hemofilters. Gentamicin adsorption by PAN hemofilters was completed at 30 minutes and it was irreversible. Conclusions The adsorption properties of gentamicin by the two hemofilters were markedly different.Critical Care March 2009 Vol 13 Suppl 1 29th International Symposium on Intensive Care and Emergency Medicine Figure 1 (abstract P275) Reporting of required parameters for dose regimen calculation in the literature. S115P277 Slow continuous ultrafiltration: how many fluids must be taken out? G Guiotto, S Gligorova, F Paladino, F Schiraldi, S Verde San P277 (doi: 10.1186/cc7441) Ultrafiltration (UF) is safe in treating volume-overloaded patients with acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) and diuretic resistance [1]. Accurate determination of the amount of fluid to be removed and maintenance of the circulating blood volume are critically important [2]. The inferior vena cava diameter (IVCD) and its collapsibility index (IVCCI) are compromised in ADHF patients due to high right atrial pressure [3]. We hypothesized that monitoring of IVCCI could be used to optimize fluid removal rate during UF. Methods Twenty patients (nine male, 11 female; age 76 \u00b1 4, New York Heart Association classes III to IV) admitted to our medical ICU for ADHF were treated with UF (Aquadex System 100; CHF Solutions, Minneapolis, MN, USA). The heart rate (HR), mean arterial pressure (MAP) and IVCD with M-mode subcostal echocardiography during spontaneous breathing were evaluated before UF (T0), at 12 hours (T1) and at 24 hours (T2). The IVCCI was calculated as follows: [(IVCDmax- IVCDmin) / IVCDmax] x 100. Results The mean UF time was 25.5 \u00b1 5 hours with a mean volume of 259 ml/hour and a total ultrafiltrate production of 6.6 \u00b1 2 l. Differences between the T0 and T2 parameters are presented in Table 1. Hypotension was observed only in those patients (2/20) who reached IVCCI >35%. In all the other patients a significant increase in IVCCI was obtained without any hemodynamic instability.

IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10are correlated with increased mortality in septic shock acute renal failure (ARF) [1]. ARF treatment requires renal replacement therapy (RRT). The cytokine plasmatic level during and after hemodialysis (HD) in septic is partially described [2]. (PMMA) hemodialyser membranes own high adsorptive capacity In this prospective observational trial, we study the plasmatic level of IL-6, IL-8 and IL-10 during and after the first HD seance with PMMA membrane in septic shock patients with ARF. Methods Inclusion criteria: patients with septic shock <24 hours as defined by the American College of Chest Physicians/Society of Critical Care Medecine and requiring RRT (Injury in the RIFLE criteria). The hemodialyser PMMA membrane was Filtrizer BK-1,6 F (TORAY Industrie, Tokyo, Japan). Data and blood samples were collected at: start of HD (D0), every hour during HD (D1; D2), at the end of HD (endD); and 30, 60, 90, 120 and 180 minutes after HD (postD0.5; postD1; postD1.5; postD2; postD3, respectively). Solid-phase ELISA was cytokine measurements. Statistical analysis was by Kruskall-Wallis nonparametric test. Results Ten patients were included. At D0: Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (14.6 \u00b1 0.8) and IGS 2 (Simplified Acute Physiology Score II) (79.11 \u00b1 4.73).

Thenorepinephrine rate and mean did endD IL-8 and IL-10 elimination by possible membrane saturation. TheIL-6 concentration was not modified. Three hours after HD, the IL-8and IL-10 concentrations were back to baseline. This fast increasecould be explained by plasmatic rebound and must be kept inmind. This rebound could be deleterious in this stage of sepsis.References1.

The Immusorba TR-350 (Asahikasei-Kuraray Medical Co.Ltd, Japan) (TR) is an IA column currently used for Myastheniagravis or Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome. This column, in whichtryptophan is immobilized as a ligand, has a property to have highaffinity to IgG subclass 3. With this property, imunoglobulinsubstitution is not usually required after the IA treatment. Sincecardiodepressant antibodies belong to IgG subclass 3, weinvestigated the effect of IA using this column on cardiac functionin patients with DCM.Methods Seventeen DCM patients (left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) <30%) participated in the study. IA was conductedevery other day three to five times. Blood was drawn at the rate of80 to 100 ml/minute by direct venipuncture or from the bloodaccess catheter and it was first passed through the plasma-separating column. The separated plasma was then passedthrough the TR at the rate of 20 ml/minute. A total of 1,500 to2,000 ml plasma was processed per one session. Either heparin ornafamostat mesylate was used as an anticoagulant. The LVEF by quantitative gated single photon The and muscarinic M2-acetylcholine receptor antibodies were measured by ELISA.Results After the three to five sessions of IA treatment, cardiodepressant antibodies were almost completely cleared fromthe circulation. Three months after the IA sessions, the LVEFincreased significantly from 18.7 \u00b1 2.3 to 23.2 \u00b1 2.6%, P<0.05. The average increase rate was 33.1 \u00b1 12.6% from the baseline.Limited to the 10 patients who initially revealed the high titer ofcardiodepressant antibodies, the increase in LVEF was greater (54.5 \u00b1 16.8% from the baseline). The cardiodepressant anti-bodies were not detected at this period except in one patient. Allpatients tolerated IA without any complication. Any cardiac eventor mortality did not take place over the period of 3 months.Conclusions The IA treatment with TR may bring benefit in left ventricular function in patients with DCM, particularly in those witha high titer of cardiodepressant antibodies. Further long-termfollow-up is, however, required before confirming its efficacy.Reference1. Baba A: Autoantigen estimation and simple has been shown to lower mortality in sepsis [1]. The effects of a new endotoxin adsorber(Alteco LPS Adsorber; Alteco Medical AB, Lund, Sweden) on thelength of noradrenaline (NA) treatment and lipopolysaccharideblood levels in abdominal septic shock were evaluated.Methods Following consent a 2-hour hemoperfusion with LPS adsorber was began in five patients [2]. Sepsis guidelines werefollowed [3]. Two historical controls per case were selected.Results The mean total duration of NA infusion was 46 hours shorter in the adsorber group compared with the control group(95% CI = -104 hours to 12 hours, P = 0.165) (Table 1). The average length of NA infusion was 17.4 \u00b1 6.8 hours (5.8 to23.8 hours) following the start of adsorption treatment. The level ofLPS decreased in all but one study patient and all were without NAat 24 hours. The mean Sequential Organ Failure Assessmentdecrease was 3.4 \u00b1 1.7 from baseline to 24 hours post treatmentThe average length of hospital stay was 3.4 days shorter in theadsorber group (95% CI of the difference, -21.7 to 14.8 days,P= 0.881). All study patients were alive on day 28 and one control died in the hospital.Conclusions Single 2-hour LPS hemoperfusion was associated with a rapid decrease in NA dose, reversal of septic shock, anddecrease in organ dysfunctions and LPS concentrations. The totalduration of NA infusion and hospital stay were shorter comparedwith historical controls, but the difference was not statisticallysignificant in this small study.References1.

P281 Experience with the use of selective sorbents in complex intensive care of sepsis in patients after cardiac surgery M Yaroustovsky, M Abramyan, Z Popok, E Nazarova, D Popov, O Stupchenko, M Plushch Centre Cardiovascular Surgery, Moscow, Russian Federation Critical Care 2009, 13(Suppl 1): P281 (doi: 10.1186/cc7445) Introduction The aim of the study was to evaluate the first experience with endotoxin adsorption in complex intensive care of critically ill patients with sepsis after heart surgery. Methods Eleven adult patients were studied. Patients were divided into two groups: undergoing Alteco LPS adsorption procedures (n= 6), and undergoing hemoperfusion using Toraymyxin columns (n= 5). Intensive therapy of sepsis in both groups included anti- bacterial therapy, hemodynamic and respiratory support, preven- tion stress nutritive support, and studied extracorporeal techniques to endotoxin removal (two procedures for every patient). Results Endotoxin adsorption procedures were started on average at day 8 after surgery in patients with systemic inflammatory response syndrome and confirmed Gram-negative infection. As the result of procedures, hemodynamic indices improved in both groups while the dose of inotropic support decreased. Also we noted the improvement of oxygenating lung function. Positive dynamics of procalcitonin, endotoxin and inflammation mediator concentrations were noted. A favorable influence of studied procedures on the course of the infective process was confirmed by the dynamics of leukocyte count and the tendency to normali- zation of body temperature. Blood cultures taken several days after the procedures were negative. There was no deterioration of hemodynamic indices during and after procedures. No cases of thrombosis of the extracorporeal contour were noted. Data are presented in Figure 1 as mean \u00b1 SEM. Conclusions Both studied procedures are safe. Clinical studies should be continued to define the place of endotoxin adsorption in complex treatment of critically ill patients with sepsis.P282 Best choice of acute blood purification therapy based on the severity score and blood lactic acid values in septic shock patients Y Sakamoto1, K Mashiko1, H Matsumoto1, Medical School, Chiba, Japan; 2Nippon Japan Critical Care 2009, 13(Suppl 1): P282 (doi: 10.1186/cc7446) Introduction Septic shock is a condition associated with diffuse coagulopathy and multiple organ failure, and frequently leads to death. Direct hemoperfusion using a polymyxin B-immobilized fiber column (DHP-PMX) has been used for the treatment of septic shock [1]. On the other hand, there is another kind of acute blood purification therapy, but the optimal column of continuous veno- venous hemodiafiltration (CVVHDF) is still controversial. Methods We treated 88 septic shock patients by DHP-PMX. The patients were divided into two groups based on the survival outcome and on the improvement in the circulatory dynamics immediately after DHP-PMX (Group A: increase of systolic blood pressure (SBP) by more than 30 mmHg (44 cases); Group B: increase of SBP by 30 mmHg or less (44 cases)). In another study conducted to review the best choice of acute blood purification therapy after DHP-PMX, the patients were divided into three groups: groups undergoing CVVHDF using a polymethylmethacrylate membrane hemofilter (PMMA) (28 cases), CVVHDF using a polyacrylonitrile membrane hemofilter (26 cases), and no CVVHDF after DHP-PMX (34 cases). Results There were 48 survival cases and 40 expired cases. The overall survival rate was 54.5% (good outcome judging from the APACHE II score), and outcome significantly related to APACHE II score, Sepsis-Related Organ Failure Assessment score and blood lactic acid value before treatment ( P<0.0001). The improvement rates of the blood pressure (increased by more than 30 mmHg) were 50.0% and significantly low blood lactic acid level in Group A. For another examination, only the PMMA CVVHDF group showed a better outcome (survival rate of 78.6%) compared with the other groups ( P= 0.0190). In addition, only the PMMA CVVHDF group showed significant improvements of the blood lactic acid on day 3 ( P= 0.0011). Conclusions Our study suggests that DHP-PMX treatment was effective in the early phase of septic shock before critical increase of the blood lactic acid levels. The optimal column for CVVHDF, as determined by improvement of the blood lactic acid levels, following DHP-PMX treatment is the PMMA column. Reference 1.

P283 effects of polymyxin B immobilised fiber with direct hemoperfusion for the patients of severe sepsis or septic shock caused by intra-abdominal infections T Ikeda1, K Ikeda1, H Taniuchi1, S Suda1, Medical Center, Tokyo, fiber with direct hemoperfusion (PMX-DHP) has been used for treatment of patients with severe sepsis and septic shock primarily caused by Gram-negative infections in Japan [1]. OneAvailable online http://ccforum.com/supplements/13/S1 Figure 1 P281) DHP-PMX, twenty-six septic patients who had severe sepsis or septic shock due to intra-abdominal infections were treated withPMX-DHP.Methods These patients were separated into two groups: whose who survived for at least 28 days after the start of PMX-DHPtherapy (survival: 85 cases) and those who did not (nonsurvival: 41cases). Background factors and inflammatory mediators wereexamined in each group. PMX-DHP was assessed with thechanges of clinical parameters (heart rate, systolic arterial pressure, mean was diagnosed thecriteria of the American College of Chest Physicians/Critical CareMedicine Consensus Conference Committee.Results A total of 91.7% of survival cases were principally treated with surgical procedure. On demographic data, Goris's multipleorgan failure score only showed significant differences betweenthe groups ng/ml immediately afterPMX-DHP in the survival group, but, it did not change significantlyin the nonsurvival group. There was PCT ( r= 0.527, P<0.001). Conclusions Our results may suggest that PMX-DHP for the patients with severe sepsis or septic shock caused by intra-abdominal infections can improve hemodynamic changes andpulmonary oxygenation, and also reduce systemic inflammatorycytokines the survival group.Reference1.

Coupled plasmafiltration adsorption (CPFA) is a new extracorporeal technology forseptic shock and may improve haemodynamic respiratory functionand mortality. The aim of this study is to evaluate during CPFA thehaemodynamic response and respiratory function and thereduction of inflammatory markers.Methods Eighteen septic patients have been enrolled in this study within 8 hours from sepsis diagnosis. Every patient had threeCPFA treatments for 8 hours with Q blood = 200 ml/hour, Q ultra-filtration = 30 ml/kg/hour and Q plasma = 20% of Q blood. At T0(basal), T1 (after first cycle), T2 (after second cycle), T3 (after thirdcycle) and T4 (after 72 hours) we evaluated haemodynamicparameters, norepinephrine dosage, PaO 2/FiO2ratio and plasma IL-6, and procalcitonin. All data are expressed as the mean \u00b1 SD.ANOVA was used to compare changes during the times of study.P<0.05 was statistically significant. Results Table 1 presents the main results of the study. Conclusions In contrast with a recent experimental study in septic pigs [1], data from this study confirm that CPFA improveshaemodynamics during septic shock. This improvement may be related to the reduction of IL-6 and first of all of procalcitonin.Procalcitonin clearance during CPFA may have a role in theimprovement of shock-related vasoparalysis, as calcitonin receptorfamily complexes have been implicated recently in thepathogenesis of sepsis.Reference1.

In this study, we investigatethat clinical efficacy concerning the improvement of APACHE IIand SOFA scores.Methods A prospective randomized, controlled clinical trial was performed in this study. The newly developed column containsmicroporous cellulose beads with a hexadecyl alkyl chain as theligand. Eighteen patients with early septic shock or septic organdysfunction were enrolled. Nine of the 18 were randomized todirect hemoperfusion (DHP). All patients received supportiveintensive care, and those randomized to DHP received directhemoperfusion for 4 hours more than two times up to 14 timesduring 14 days. We measured the plasma concentration of IL-6,IL-8, IL-1 , and TNF . The APACHE II score and SOFA score were evaluated for each patient on the 1st, 7th, 14th and 28th dayafter starting treatment before the treatment in the morning.Results The decrease of APACHE II score from the pretreatment level at the 7th day was significantly larger in the CTR-001treatment group than in the control group ( P= 0.0189; Mann- Whitney test). On the other hand, there were no significantchanges of the SOFA score at the 7th day. Adsorption column-related serious adverse events were not observed in the DHPgroup. The concentration of IL-6 and IL-8 in the plasma decreasedfrom the pretreatment level group significantly(P= 0.0464, P = 0.0464 respectively; Wilcoxon test). Conclusions The newly developed direct hemoperfusion column improved the septic shock better than the ordinary supportiveintensive care. This new cytotoxic removal column may play animportant role in treatment of patients with septic shock.Critical Care March 2009 Vol 13 Suppl 1 29th International Symposium on Intensive Care and Emergency Medicine Table 1 (abstract P284) T0 T4 P value Mean arterial \u00b1 15 5 \u00b1 2 <0.001S119P286 Beneficial effects of early hemoperfusion with a polymyxin B fibre column on septic shock N Takeyama, H Noguchi, K Morino, T Obata, T Sakamoto, H Ishikura, Y M Kobayashi, Y 2009, 13(Suppl 1): P286 (doi: 10.1186/cc7450) Introduction The aim was to verify the hypothesis that extracorporeal therapy with a polymyxin B (PMX) fibre column mayprevent septic shock-induced organ dysfunction and that of septic shock with PMX hemoperfusion may improvepatient outcome.Methods One hundred and sixteen patients with septic shock who were admitted to the ICU of 35 hospitals were enrolled in thisstudy from April 2006 through March 2008. PMX treatment wasperformed immediately after septic shock was diagnosed. Allpatients were followed up for 28 days after enrollment in the study,and 28-day mortality was assessed. Arachidonylethanolamide, 2-arachidonoylglycerol, IL-6, lipopolysaccharide, theSepsis-related Organ Failure Assessment score were determinedbefore PMX treatment and at 24, 72, and 168 hours after thetreatment.Results At the end of PMX treatment, the mean arterial pressure and plasma HCO 3-were significantly increased ( P <0.01), and the plasma level of lactate was significantly decreased ( P <0.05). Seven days after treatment, the PaO2/FiO2ratio was significantly increased ( P <0.05), and the plasma level of creatinine and arachidonylethanolamide were significantly decreased ( P <0.05). Of the 57 surviving patients, 24 patients were treated with PMXwithin 6 hours after the diagnosis of the septic shock (early group)and 33 did not treat within 6 hours (late group). There was nosignificant difference between the early and late groups about 28-day mortality (41.5% and 37.7%, respectively; P = NS), whereas serum creatinine and the PaO 2/FiO2ratio were significantly improved ( P <0.05). The ICU stay was shorter in the early group than the late group (10.6 vs. 16.4 days; P= 0.088). Conclusions Hemoperfusion with PMX was a safe and effective treatment for improvement of hypotension and hypoperfusion inseptic shock patients. PMX treatment within 6 hours afterdiagnosis of septic shock would be beneficial with respect tooxygenation and renal function.References1. Vincent JL, J 2004, 50:563-567.

Optimal usage of PMX-DHP for the patients withseptic shock remains a matter of debate, mainly because of a lack of adequately designed clinical trials.Methods The observational study, carried out in 21 hospitals in Japan, was designed to investigate the effects of PMX-DHP forpatients with septic shock. A total of 36 patients with septic shockwere enrolled between April 2004 and January 2005.Results Forty-four percent (16/36) was acute peritonitis, which required laparotomy of the peritoneum before PMX-DHP. The other 56% (20/36) was unable to remove the site ofinfection, such as urinary tract infection, respiratory infection andunknown cause of infections. Inhospital death rates were 6%(1/16) in patients with acute peritonitis and 55% (11/20) in thosewithout acute peritonitis ( P = 0.0446). The early indication rates of PMX-DHP, within 24 hours since the onset of septic shock, were61% (22/36). Among those 22 patients, the rate of achievingmean arterial pressure more than 65 mmHg within 6 hours of theonset of septic shock was (14/22), and 18% (4/22) achieved65 mmHg within 24 hours.Conclusions In this group of septic patients, the better survival rates of patients with acute peritonitis were associated with PMX-DHP. Early induction of PMX-DHP also contributed to recoveringadequate arterial blood pressure. P288 Investigation of type II phospholipase A2values and eicosanoid values during polymyxin-B-immobilized fiber direct hemoperfusion of septic shock patients T Shouzushima, Y Suzuki, G Takahashi, S Shibata, N Sato, S is a rate- limiting enzyme the cascade. We investigated 2and eicosanoids during polymyxin-B-immobilized fiber direct hemoperfusion (PMX-DHP) of septic shock patients.Methods A highly sensitive nephelometry method was used to measure endotoxin. The 11 patients all had positive endotoxinlevels (>1.1 ng/ml). Their mean age was 69 years (range: 43 to85 years). The mean APACHE II score was 32 points, and themean SOFA score was 14 points. PMX-DHP was performed twicein every patient.Results The endotoxin level of every patient converted to negative after two PMX-DHP sessions, and they rapidly recovered fromshock. The patient's TNF values decreased significantly (from 296 to 133 pg/ml) in response to the two PMX-DHP sessions, andtheir LBT4 values (from 114 to 77 pg/ml), PGF1 values (from 32 to 19 pg/ml), and TXB2 values (from 79 to 57 pg/ml) also alldecreased significantly. The 28-day mortality rate was 9%, and the180-day mortality rate was 18%.Conclusions The results suggested that type II PLA 2produced in response to stimulation (for example, endotoxins or proinflam-matory cytokines) may further activate the arachidonic acidcascade, induce the production of various lipid mediators, and beinvolved in the formation of various pathological conditions. Itseemed that production of these humoral factors decreased as aresult of suppression of the inflammatory response by performingPMX-DHP and that their suppression was linked to theimprovement in pathology.Available online http://ccforum.com/supplements/13/S1S120P289 Lipid mediator adosorption with dialyser membrane in patients with septic shock Y Kase1, Y Sakamoto2, T Obata1 1Jikei University School of Medicine, (doi: 10.1186/cc7453) Introduction Several studies have shown the effectiveness of non- renal indication of continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) orendotoxin-adosorbing fibers (direct hemoperfusion therapy withpolymyxin-B immobilized fibers (PMX-DHP)) for patients withseptic shock in improving unstable cardiovascular status. Thisnonrenal indication of CRRT might be the additional benefits thatresulted in adsorbing various bioactive lipid mediators with dialysermembranes. also known to adosorb various bioactivemediators except endotoxin. In this investigation, the additionalbenefits of CRRT were investi-gated after use in patients with septic shock. Various adosorbedbioactive lipid mediators, mainly arachidonylethanolamide and 2-arachidonylglycerol, in these in PMXBIFand then in PMMA, while polysulfone and polyacrylonitrileadosorbed a relatively low amount of lipid mediators.Conclusions The amount of adosorbed bioactive lipid mediators with PMXBIF and PMMA cannot be disregarded. It is necessary totake this result into consideration for selection of the dialysermembrane at the time of nonrenal indication of CRRT for patientswith septic shock. P290 Microbiologic contamination of ultrasound transducers utilized by anesthesiologists in the operating room and ICU F Lytle, B Knoll, T Comfere Mayo 1): P290 (doi: 10.1186/cc7454) Introduction Ultrasound is increasingly used to facilitate central venous catheter and regional anesthetic block placement [1,2].Bacterial colonization of ultrasound probes has been demonstratedand the potential for cross-contamination between patients exists[3]. There are few, if any, studies investigating this for proceduresperformed by anesthesiologists, in the operating room and ICU.Methods Following Institutional Review Board approval, 18 ultrasound probes utilized by anesthesiologists were sampled after1 week of average usage during 2 months in 2008. Standardmicrobiologic techniques were used [4]. Data were recorded,stored securely, and analyzed using appropriate statistics.Results Sixty-nine samples were obtained. Forty-nine percent of samples showed bacterial colonization. Coagulase-negative staphylo- coccus was identified in 42.6%. The incidence of Staphylococcus aureus (1.4%) and Gram-negative bacteria (4.4%) was low. Conclusions Ultrasound probes utilized in busy operating rooms and ICUs at a tertiary-care facility are a potential source forcontamination and cross-contamination. Further studies ofultrasound use, probe contamination with the potential to serve asa vector for pathogens, and cleaning protocols are indicated.References 1. Bodenham AR: 62:694-698. 4.

Allmicroorganisms isolated from patients were recorded and theirresistance patterns were also ascertained.Results Sixty-nine patients were diagnosed as DAI using the criteria of the Centers for Disease Control. Ventilator-associatedpneumonia (VIP) was the most frequent, with an incidence of49.3% ( n= 35), followed by n= 15) with an incidence of 28.9% and 21.8%, respectively. The most frequent pathogens inVIP cases were Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 57% of cases of which were resistant to fluoroquinolones), enterobacteriaceaespecies in 22% of the cases (50% of which were resistant toceftriaxone) and Staphylococcus aureus in 8% of the cases (100% of which were methicillin resistant). The most frequentpathogens in CR-UTI cases were enterobactericeae in 60% ofcases which were resistant to ceftriaxone), enterococcispecies in 25% of the cases (none of the enterococci wasresistant to vancomycine) and P. aeruginosa in 15% of cases (100% of which were resistant to flouroquinolones). The mostfrequent pathogens in CVC-BSI cases were coagulase-negativestaphylococci in 66% of cases (75% of which were methicillinresistant), S. aureus in 20% of the cases (85% of which were resistant to methicilline) and enterobacteriaceae species in 14% ofcases (30% of which were ceftriaxone).Conclusions DAI increase the mortality and morbidity rates in the ICU. Therefore it is important to know the possible pathogenmicroorganisms and their resistance patterns for the success ofthe selection of the ampiric antibiotic treatment.Reference1.

P293 Effects of body orientation on the development of ventilator-associated pneumonia in mechanically ventilated swine M Cressoni1, A Zanella2, 13(Suppl 1): P293 (doi: 10.1186/cc7457) Introduction Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is frequent nosocomial infection with an average incidence of 20% of ICUpatients undergoing mechanical ventilation. Elevation of the headof the bed to >30\u00b0 (semirecumbent position) is a recommendedstrategy to reduce gastric reflux, and subsequent aspiration ofcolonized gastric contents. However, the efficacy of this strategy to prevent VAP remains controversial. We studied the relationshipbetween gravity and VAP in a swine model, an omnivore withgastrointestinal physiology similar to humans.Methods Twenty-six female Yucatan minipigs were randomized into four groups: (A) eight pigs were mechanically ventilated withan orientation of the trachea approximately 45\u00b0 above horizontal for72 hours. In the remaining three groups (B to D) the head of thebed was oriented 10\u00b0 below horizontal (Trendelenburg position):(B) six pigs were mechanically ventilated for 72 hours; (C) six pigswere mechanically ventilated for 72 hours with enteral feeding; and(D) six pigs were mechanically ventilated for 168 hours with enteralfeeding. At the end of the study period, pigs were electivelysacrificed and quantitative lung microbiological cultures performed.Results All eight pigs kept in a semirecumbent position developed pneumonia and respiratory failure (PaO 2/FiO2= 132 \u00b1 139 mmHg vs. 479 \u00b1 42 mmHg, P<0.0001) with a median of 5.5 lobes out of six colonized. Sixteen pigs kept in the semirecumbent position hadsterile lungs and two pigs ventilated in the Trendelenburg positionfor 7 days developed a low level of colonization. Body orientationwas the only significant predictor of lung colonization and pneu-monia ( P<0.001). Conclusions The semirecumbent position is uniformly associated with lung colonization and respiratory failure by 72 hours. Incontrast. the positioning of the trachea and the endotracheal tubebelow the horizontal prevented the development of VAP. P294 Gastroesophageal reflux in mechanically ventilated pediatric patients and its relation to ventilator acquired pneumonia T Shahin, M El-Hodhod, H Ibrahim Faculty of Medicine, Ain Shams University, Cairo, EgyptCritical Care 2009, 13(Suppl 1): P294 (doi: 10.1186/cc7458) Introduction The objective was to determine the frequency of gastroesophageal reflux (GER) in mechanically ventilated pediatricpatients and its role as a risk factor for ventilator-acquiredpneumonia (VAP) that may be enhanced among these patients.Methods The study was conducted in a pediatric ICU of Ain Shams University Hospital on 24 mechanically ventilated patients(16 VAP patients and eight without VAP as controls, with meanage 16.6 \u00b1 20.5 and 18.6 \u00b1 22.4 months, respectively). Esopha-geal 24 hour pH-metry beside clinical and laboratory evaluation ofthe underlying problem and severity of the patient's condition werecarried out.Results All VAP patients had GER (50% alkaline reflux, 12.5% acidic reflux and 37.5% combined reflux) compared with 75% ofnon-VAP patients (100% alkaline reflux). The total reflux time wasfound to be significantly longer among VAP (50 minutes) versusnon-VAP (3 minutes) patients. There was a significant increase inacidic reflux parameters among nonsurvivors versus survivors(P<0.001). Conclusions GER is a constant incident in our mechanically ventilated pediatric patients, with alkaline reflux being morecommon than acidic reflux.

P295 Incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia in patients undergoing elective tube exchange to LoTrach endotracheal tubes A Fletcher, J Carter, M Blunt, P Young Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Kings Lynn, UKCritical Care 2009, 13(Suppl 1): P295 (doi: 10.1186/cc7459) Introduction The objective was to study a cohort of general ICU patients electively reintubated with the LoTrach tracheal tube (tubeexchange) to determine safety and to audit postproceduralventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Emergency reintubationfollowing elective or unplanned extubation is a known risk factor forsubsequent VAP [1]; however, there are no published data on theeffects of protocol-based elective tube exchange. The LoTrachtube prevents the pulmonary aspiration that occurs withconventional cuffs [2] and allows subglottic secretion manage-ment, thereby directly influencing two key steps in the patho-genesis of VAP.Methods Sequential patients (53 patients in 14 months) receiving the LoTrach tracheal tube and cuff pressure controller werestudied. Patients either underwent an elective tube exchange(using a bougie, preprocedural preoxygenation, gastric tubeaspiration, muscle relaxation and airway secretions) or were primary LoTrach intubations onthe ICU. Three clinicians independently examined the critical careelectronic patient record. VAP was identified by a fall in thePaO 2/FaO2ratio >25% or a clinical pulmonary infection score >5 and the presence of a positive qualitative tracheal aspirate. Theinternational consensus criteria for VAP diagnosis were also used,as was the institution of antimicrobial therapy (if this was triggeredby a clinical suspicion of VAP, then for the purposes of this studyVAP was diagnosed).Results Forty-four (83%) patients underwent elective tube exchange. No complications were noted associated with theprocedure. There were no episodes of VAP while the LoTrach wasin situ . On an intention-to-treat basis there was a 1.8% VAP rate because one patient who required emergency reintubationfollowing elective extubation received a conventional tube anddeveloped VAP 2 days later. No other patients had antimicrobialsbegun for chest infections.Conclusions There were no complications associated with elective tube exchange and no subsequent cases of VAP in thiscohort of patients who were reintubated with the LoTrach tube.Elective tracheal tube exchange can be safely performed in generalICU patients.References1.

VAP is the most frequent infection inventilated patients, occurring in up to 27% of cases [1].Methods We studied 993 patients from September 2005, over a 39-month period, following the introduction of our ventilation carebundle, which includes 30\u00b0 head-up position, and usingchlorhexidine for mouth care. VAP is difficult to diagnose anddefinitions vary. Our diagnoses were made prospectively by asingle consultant microbiologist using the validated ClinicalPulmonary Infection Score. After 18 months we introduced the Hi-Lo Evac/Lanz Mallinckrodt endotracheal tubes with suction appliedusing a 10 ml syringe 2-hourly, as our study intervention.Results The benchmark for European ICUs is a rate of 5% to 15% (HELICS; Hospital In Europe Link for Infection Control throughSurveillance) and in America is 3 to 20 cases per 1,000 ventilator-days (NNIS; National Nosocomial Infections Surveillance System).For the 18 months following the implementation of care bundles,our VAP rate was 5.39% (25/463 patients) with an incidence of14 cases per 1,000 ventilator-days. Following the study inter-vention the VAP rate fell to 1.5% (8/530 patients) and theincidence to 4.17 cases per 1,000 ventilator-days. Our cohort ofpatients over the period had no difference in APACHE II scores.The difference between the groups following the employment ofsubglottic secretion reached statistical significance with relativerisk 3.57 (95% CI = 1.63 to 7.85, P<0.001). Conclusions Our study confirms the benefit of subglottic secretion clearance to reduce the occurrence of VAP.References1. American Thoracic Society: Am J Respir Crit Care Med 2005, 171:388-416.

P297 Ventilator-associated pneumonia in a Greek prevalence Katsiari, E Apostolakou, A P297 (doi: 10.1186/cc7461) Introduction Nosocomial pneumonia is cause of death from hospital-acquired infections. Ventilator-associated pneumonia(VAP) is the most frequent ICU-acquired infection in mechanicallyventilated patients. The purpose of our study is to assess theprevalence and the etiologic pathogens of VAP in our ICU, as wellas its impact on morbidity and mortality.Methods A prospective observational study in a multidisciplinary eight-bed ICU. During an 18-month period, 160 consecutivepatients with a length of stay (LOS) 48 hours were enrolled in the study. Data were collected using a specially designed softwareand included age, gender, APACHE II score on admission, days onmechanical ventilation, LOS and ICU outcome. Patients werestratified into two groups: Group A included patients who did notCritical Care March 2009 Vol 13 Suppl 1 29th International Symposium on Intensive Care and Emergency MedicineS123develop VAP ( n= 144), and Group B patients in whom VAP diagnosis was confirmed ( n= 16). In Group B, isolated pathogens and their in vitro susceptibilities were also recorded. VAP diagnosis was established on the basis of clinical criteria andpositive quantitative cultures of bronchial aspirates ( 10 5colony- forming and the Mann-Whitney rank-sum test.Results Age (64 \u00b1 18 vs. 70 \u00b1 13 years, P = 0.257) and APACHE II score on admission (18.9 \u00b1 7.6 vs. 18.8 \u00b1 9.7, P= 0.965) were similar in both groups. Calculated VAP incidence was 5.87/1,000ventilator-days (four early and 12 late-onset VAP). Duration ofmechanical ventilation (17 \u00b1 22 vs. 30 \u00b1 12 days, P < 0.001) and LOS (19 \u00b1 22 vs. 34 \u00b1 15 days, P <0.001) were statistically longer in Group B. Isolated pathogens included: baumannii (10 patients), aeruginosa (two patients), other Gram-negative (one patient). Overall antibiotic to carbapenemes higher in Group B (24.3% vs. 43.8%).Conclusions All VAP cases in our ICU were caused by Gram- negative multidrug-resistant bacteria. Colimycin seems to be ourmajor therapeutic weapon against these strains. VAP prolongs theduration of mechanical ventilation and LOS, and contributes tohigher mortality rates in ICU patients requiring mechanical ventilation. P298 Ventilator-associated pneumonia after procedures in cardiac surgery J Wojkowska-Mach1, M Baran2, R Drwila2, E Foryciarz2, D 1Jagiellonian University Medical School, Krakow, Poland; 2John Paul II 1): hospital-acquired infections in inten- sive care wards is a very important but time-consuming processrequiring involvement of all medical personnel [1]. This meanspublished data on infections after cardiac surgery are rather limited[2]. The aim of this study was to analyze the epidemiology andetiology of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) followingcoronary surgery in ICU patients.Methods The surveillance was based on the active method. Cases of infections were detected by the hospital Infection Control Teamin cooperation with the unit personnel in accordance with Centersfor Disease Control definitions during 2007. Data on surgical siteinfections (SSI; 33 cases) served as the background for validationof VAP surveillance.Results Altogether 53 VAP cases after 2,170 surgical events were detected. The ventilator utilization ratio was 0.52. The totalcumulative VAP incidence rate was 2.2% and the ventilator-associated hospital-acquired pneumonia rate was 18.3/1,000ventilator-days; mortality was 1.9%. The total cumulative incidenceSSI rate albicans . Conclusions In the analyzed setting, in which surveillance of SSI has been run since 2002, detected SSI incidence rates are similarto those reported in the National Nosocomial InfectionsSurveillance and Krankenhaus Infectionen Surveillance Systemprograms [3,4]. However, obtained data on the epidemiology ofVAP are different. Also, there are differences in both theepidemiology and microbiology of VAP in this hospital and resultsreported from other cardiac surgery wards. This indicates anecessity for introducing effective surveillance of hospital-acquired pneumonia after cardiac surgery procedures in the ICU.Acknowledgement Partially financed by K/ZDS/000649.

The aim of our study was to test the incidence, therate of mortality and the impact of VAP to prolong the duration ofICU stay, in our both medical and surgical ICU.Methods During a 32-month period, from November 2005 to August 2008, 127 patients were admitted to our ICU; 114 of themhad received mechanical ventilation and were included retro-spectively in our study. The sum of the mechanical ventilation dayswas 1,330. The patients compared were divided into two groups.Group A included 28 patients (24.5% of the total) with VAP (fiveearly and 23 late), and Group B included 86 patients with no VAP.Results The incidence of VAP was 24.5% in patients receiving mechanical ventilation, or 21 of episodes per 1,000 days ofmechanical ventilation. We detected no statistically significantdifference among the two groups according to age (mean \u00b1 SD):64.62 \u00b1 15.9 and 64.53 \u00b1 16.9, P= APACHE II SD): 19.96 \u00b1 6.8 and 19.33 \u00b1 7.79, P= 0.7. We detected a statistically significant difference among the two groupsaccording to the duration of ICU stay (days, 33.75 \u00b120 and 10.27 \u00b1 11.29, P<0.0001. We a difference according to the rate of mortality, 32.14% and 22.09%, respec-tively, although not statistically significant, P= 0.31, OR = 1.67. Conclusions The incidence of VAP in our study is similar to other studies, which varies from 8% to 28%. VAP prolongs the durationof ICU stay, while the attributable mortality rate for VAP is stilldebated. Nevertheless, we have to improve our clinical approach inorder to recognize better the risk factors and to develop a moreeffective prevention program.

Differences in CC-10 concentrations have been demon- strated in several inflammatory lung diseases (for example,bronchial asthma and chronic eosinophilic pneumonia). Moreover,there is evidence that in infectious pulmonary diseases the type ofmicroorganism (for example, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ) influences CC-10 activity. In this study we evaluated the presence of CC-10in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid as a potential marker forventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) in critically ill patients with asuspicion of VAP.Methods Between January 2003 and December 2007 all consecutive BAL fluid samples from critically ill patients in the ICUof the Maastricht University Medical Center clinically suspected ofVAP were included. Patients were divided into two groups: if BAL fluid cultures yielded 10 4colony-forming units/ml and/or microscopic analysis revealed 2% intracellular organisms. The CC-10 concentration was measured with acommercially available ELISA, and retrospective analysis wasperformed. Areas under the curve of receiver operatingcharacteristic curves were calculated for CC-10 concentrations.Results A total of 196 BAL fluid samples were included from 196 patients (123 men, 73 women). Seventy-nine out of suspected VAP the non-VAP group ( P = 0.06), with an area under the curve of 0.586. In addition, CC-10 concentrations were not significantlydifferent between the non-VAP group and the VAP group causedby a specific organism (for example, P. aeruginosa ) (P = 0.386). Conclusions CC-10 concentration in BAL fluid is not a useful marker to differentiate between VAP and non-VAP. P301 Presence of human metapneumovirus in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of critically ill patients C Linssen, M Vanspauwen, C Bruggeman, E Wouters, D Bergmans, W Van MookMaastricht (hMPV) is a paramyxovirus that has been shown to cause respiratory infections in children, theelderly and immunocompromised patients. In this study weretrospectively evaluated the presence of hMPV in bronchoalveolarlavage fluid (BALF) of critically ill patients.Methods Between January 2005 and December 2007 all consecutive BALF samples from critically ill patients in the ICU ofthe Maastricht University Medical Center clinically suspected ofhospital-acquired pneumonia were included. BALF work-upincluded: differential cell count, quantitative bacterial culture, PCRfor relevant respiratory pathogens and additional stains andcultures guided by clinical suspicion. All samples were analysedretrospectively by quantitative real-time PCR targeting thenucleoprotein gene of hMPV.Results A total of 144 BALF samples were included from 121 patients in the ICU (75 men and 46 women). RNA of hMPV wasdetected in two out of 144 BALF samples (1.4%) of two patients.The first hMPV-positive patient had an underlying hematologicalmalignancy (multiple myeloma). Already being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, the patient developed signs of respiratorydistress. Five days after hospital admission, the patient wasadmitted to the ICU because of respiratory insufficiency. A BALperformed the same day yielded no causative microorganism atthat time. The second hMPV-positive patient had been admitted to the hospital with a community-acquired pneumonia for which nocausative organism was identified. Five days after hospitaladmission, progressive respiratory insufficiency necessitated ICUadmission. Twelve days after ICU admittance a bronchoalveolarlavage was performed, which yielded Candida albicans in 10 2colony-forming units/ml. In both patients no causative micro- organism for pneumonia could be identified during hospitalisation,and therefore we speculate that hMPV may at least havecontributed to or perhaps even caused the respiratory deteriorationunder antibiotic therapy.Conclusions In critically ill patients 1.4% of collected BALF samples revealed the presence of hMPV RNA. Therefore, hMPVmay play a part in respiratory complications in ICU patients. Anadditional study is necessary to investigate the extent to whichhMPV contributes to respiratory failure in patients admitted to theICU.

Twomodels were used for trend analysis: Model A: changes insusceptibility (S), intermediate (I) and resistance (R) using theEUCAST breakpoints [2] described by the logistic regressionmodel p R= 1 / (1 + exp(- aR- bRx year)) and Model B: changes in MIC distribution 2logMIC = aM+ bMx year. The parameters bRand bMdescribe the time dependence, and the hypotheses bR= 0 and bM= 0 can be tested. Year was used as the independent variable in both models.Results Resistance (I+R%) rates in 2007 and trend analysis ((+ increase, - decrease), ( Pvalues for changes in susceptibility/MIC distribution from P. aeruginosa : (I+R%) and increasing MICs (2log MIC) were found among P. aeruginosa to carbapenems and ceftazidime. For other species- antibiotic combinations there were either low (<1%) resistancerates or not the same significant changes demonstrated with thetwo trend models.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial resistance of Pseudomonas spp. strains isolated from inpatients hospitalized in the ICU of our hospital throughout a 3-year period. Methods A total of 175 clinical isolates of Pseudomonas spp. collected from January 2006 to December 2008 were investigatedin this study. Each isolate was obtained from a different patient. Identification and routine antibiograms of the isolates were carried out using the Vitek 2 automated System (BioMerieux\u00ae, Marcy I'Etolie, France). The minimum inhibitory concentrations of imipenem, and colistin were also determined by the agar dilution method according to Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines. Results The isolates included in our study originated from blood cultures 70 (40%), urine 53 (30.3%), bronchial aspirates 23 (13.1%), central venous catheters 18 (10.3%) and others 11 (6.3%). The resistance rates changed from 2006 to 2008 as follows: amikacin: 72 to 83%, aztreonam: 90 to Pseudomonas spp. infections are particularly serious for incubated ICU patients with 40 to 50% mortality rates. In our hospital, the percentage of Pseudomonas spp. multiresistant isolates has increased dramatically over the past 3 years. The majority of isolates were resistant to 15 or more antibiotics. What is most worrying is the fact that there is a prevalence of a multiresistant phenotype that was only sensitive to colistin. The emergance and rapid spread of multidrug-resistant isolates of Pseudomonas spp. are of great concern worldwide. It is necessary to limit the overuse of antibiotics and to implement a new antibiotic policy. References 1.

Ongoing surveillance of infections in burned patients is essential to detect changes in epidemiology and to guide better empirical antibiotherapy and infection control policies. The aim of this study was to analyze the bacterial flora and the antibiotic resistance of isolates in a burn department during a 2-year period. Methods From 1 January 2005 to 31 December 2006, 1,268 strains were isolated from different specimens. Antimicrobial sus- ceptibility testing has been carried out by the disk diffusion method as referred by the French Society of Microbiology. All data were stored in a laboratory database using whonet 5.3 software. Dupli- cate isolates defined as the same bacterial species for the same patient with the same antimicrobial susceptibility profile were excluded. Results The most frequently identified species were S. aureus (MRSA) was 68.1%. All isolates were fully susceptible to glycopeptides. P. aeruginosa resistance was 35.6% and 35.4% ofAvailable (abstract P302) S126strains were resistant to ceftazidime, to imipenem to ciprofloxacin. In total, 77.3% of P. stuarttii isolates were resistant to ceftazidime. The frequencies of resistance toceftazidime, ofloxacin and pneumoniae and 47.1%. The survey of resistanceshowed a global decrease in 2006 versus 2005. The rate ofMRSA was 61% in 2005 versus 51.6% in 2006. The resistance ofceftazidime was 80.6% in 2005 versus 26.9% in 2006 in P. aeruginosa . The imipenem resistance showed also a decrease in 2006 in A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa . The amelioration of hygiene, particularly washing hands after introduction of hydro-alcoholic solutions, and the collaboration between microbiologistsand clinicians could explain the decrease of resistance showed inthe burn department.Conclusions Comparative to the previous years, S. aureus is still the commonest pathogen in the burn department. The incidence ofantimicrobial resistance has decreased during 2006 after a peak ofmultiresistance during 2005. The measures of prevention takenwere efficient and should be re-enforced.

Optimal empiric therapy may reducemorbidity and mortality. Therefore, it is essential to provide theclinician with resistance data of the local circulating strains andpatients pathogens. A national surveillance program of the DutchAntibiotic Resistance Surveillance Group was started in theNetherlands in 1996 to gain insight into the emergence ofmicrobial resistance at local, regional and national levels. Thisstudy describes the findings of resistance development of S. aureus from ICUs of 14 large referral hospitals all over the Netherlands over a 10-year period from 1996 to 2006.Methods In the first 6 months of each year, the participating hospitals collected clinical isolates from, among others, blood andrespiratory samples. In total 943 isolates were collected: 250 fromthree hospitals in the north, 187 from two in the east, 229 from five inthe west and 280 from four in the south. The susceptibility torelevant antibiotics was determined by micro broth dilution accordingto the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines.Results Resistance to penicillin fluctuated over time at ~75%; seven methicillin-resistant S. aureus were isolated (0.7%). Resistance to clarithromycin increased to 10% in 2003, butdecreased in 2006 to 6%, the level before 2003. Resistance toclindamycin fluctuated over time from 4 to 8%. Doxycyclin resis-tance varied between 2 and 10%. No resistance to vancomycin,teicoplanin and linezolid was demonstrated. Resistance togentamicin and rifampicin was sporadically found. The prevalenceof fluoroquinolone resistance was between 0 and 4% until 2002.In 2003, a peak in the prevalence of resistance(ciprofloxacin 14% and moxifloxacin 8%) was observed.Resistance to ciprofloxacin remained at this high level until 2005and decreased in 2006. Resistance to moxifloxacin decreasedimmediately. Regional differences were observed for ciprofloxacin,with the highest resistance in the western and southern parts andwith doxycyclin with the lowest resistance rate in the northern part.Conclusions During the 10-year study period only an increase in resistance to ciprofloxacin was observed. The data presented stilljustify the empiric choice of flucloxacillin (with rifampicin orgentamicin depending on the indication) in case of an infectionprobably caused by S. aureus in ICU patients. P306 Clinical and microbiological efficacy of continuous versus intermittent administration of vancomycin in critical care patients M tep\u00e1n, I Chytra, P Pelnar, T Bergerov\u00e1, 10.1186/cc7470) Introduction Vancomycin is known to induce postantibiotic effect but some data suggest that bactericidal activity is time dependent.Presently, the optimal dosing regimen for administration ofvancomycin remains unknown. The aim of this open prospectiverandomized study was to compare clinical and microbiologicalefficacy of continuous infusion versus intermittent administration ofvancomycin in critically ill patients.Methods Patients admitted to the interdisciplinary ICU suffering from infection indicated to vancomycin administration withpredicted duration of treatment of at least 4 days were randomizedto receive either a 15 mg/kg intravenous loading dose ofvancomycin followed by a daily 15 mg/kg continuous infusion(continuous group) or intermittent administration of 15 mg/kgvancomycin intravenously every 12 hours (intermittent group).Antibiotic therapy was stopped at improvement of clinical state andlaboratory signs of subsidence of infection. Failure of antimicrobialtherapy was defined as persistence or progression of signs andsymptoms of infection, development of new clinical findingsconsistent with active infection or death from infection. The age,APACHE II score, type of infection, length of ICU stay, length ofmechanical ventilation, mortality, clinical and microbiological failureand length of vancomycin therapy and total dose of vancomycinwere assessed. The Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score,white blood count, C-reactive protein and renal function at thebeginning and at the end of therapy were evaluated. TheMann-Whitney test, unpaired t test and chi-squared test were used accordingly; P <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results A total of 65 patients were enrolled and randomized in the continuous ( n= 33) and intermittent ( n= 32) groups. No significant differences between both groups in all assessedparameters were found. Clinically evaluated failure of therapy in thecontinuous versus intermittent groups was in 12 (36%) patientsversus eight (25%) patients, and microbiological failure in seven(21%) patients versus eight (25%) patients.Conclusions Continuous infusion and intermittent administration of vancomycin in critically ill patients provided equivalent clinicaland microbiological outcome.Acknowledgement Supported by research grant MSM0021620819. P307 Over-increased creatinine renal clearance in septic patients and implications for vancomycin optimization J Baptista, P Casanova, P Martins, J 10.1186/cc7471) Introduction The hyperdynamic stage occurring in sepsis may be responsible for an increase in renal blood flow that may lead toCritical Care March 2009 Vol 13 Suppl 1 29th International Symposium on Intensive Care and Emergency MedicineS127increased elimination of some drugs, namely vancomycin. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of 24-hour creatinineclearance (CrCL) higher than 130 ml/min/1.73 m 2on vancomycin serum levels, and to identify an accurate marker of this condition.Methods This study was carried out in a multipurpose ICU, on 120 critical septic patients, 36% with septic shock (42 patients), 67men (72.5%), average age 56 \u00b1 21 years, average APACHE IIscore and Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS) II of 17.2and 42.2, respectively. We studied 120 consecutive vancomycintreatments (continuous perfusion) and we assessed therapeuticlevels (20 to 30 g/ml) on days 1, 2 and 3 (V1, V2 and V3). Patients were divided into two groups had similar vancomycin dosage on day 0 (47.7/46.6mg/kg; P = 0.26). Results Average age, APACHE II score and SAPS II were 62.6/44 years, 18.8/14.2 and 45/36.9, -0.47 (G1) and -0.33 (G2), both with P <0.05. The area under the curve (AUC) of the receiving operating curves of UCr,urinary urea and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) as markers of highclearance status (>130) were 0.85 (95% CI = 0.77 to 0.72(95% CI = 0.63 to 0.80) and 0.66 (95% CI = 0.55 to 0.73),respectively, and this area was maximal for a subgroup of patients(76 patients) without shock (AUC: 0.9; 95% CI = 0.81 0.96 <17 mg/dl.Conclusions Over-increased CrCL identifies a subgroup of younger patients, with lower severity scores and high incidence ofsubtherapeutic vancomycin concentrations on the first 3 days -especially on day 1 (39/43 patients; 90.7%). A UCr concentrationabove mg/dl can be a sensitive (70%) and specific (87%)marker of this condition. The addition of BUN <17 mg/dl as asecond marker increases specificity to 97.4%. P308 Vancomycin-resistant enterococci colonisation in the ICU and control K Katircioglu, M Ozkalkanli, S Gul Yurtsever, D Sanli, H Erten, V Duzenli, S SavaciIzmir Ataturk microorganisms capable of causing epidemics incritically ill patients [1]. The present report describes an outbreakinvolving VRE colonisation in our ICU.Methods After several weeks of severe nursing shortage, when often there were only three nurses for 10 critically ill patients, thefirst VRE was isolated from one of the two blood cultures of atrauma patient. Rectal swabs of all of the patients' and ICU staffwere collected. Because there was no patient who had beendischarged to the ward during this period no further analysis wasrequired.Results Enterococcus casseliflavus was isolated from six out of the 10 patients' rectal swabs. Once the outbreak was identified, allpatients were placed under strict contact isolation and cohorted,and barrier precautions were instituted. Four patients who hadnegative rectal swabs were isolated in another ICU. Five of the patients did not demonstrate signs of infection and were acceptedas colonisation. ICU staff had negative rectal swabs. Two of thepatients who had positive rectal swabs had died because ofunderlying primary disease (acute myocardial infarction, acuterespiratory distress syndrome due to aspiration pneumonia). Thefirst patient who had a positive blood culture was treated withintravenous Linezolid and discharged to home after 14 days.Another patient who had sepsis due to necrotising fasciitis wasdischarged to the ward after obtaining three negative rectal swabs.The other patient who had non-Hodgkin lymphoma and pneumoniawas discharged to the ward after obtaining three negative rectalswabs. The last patient was isolated in another room and followedup for 4 weeks and discharged to the ward after obtaining threenegative rectal swabs.Conclusions The outbreak was controlled by continuous imple- mentation of the infection control programme. A long ICU stay,hemodialysis, and nursing shortage are risk factors for VREdevelopment. Transmission of VRE can be facilitated by the handsof the staff. We conclude that this outbreak may be due to theshortage of nursing during summer.Reference1. Peta M, et al.: Outbreak of vancomycin-resistant Entero- coccus in an Italian intensive care unit.

P309 Activities of vancomycin, teicoplanin linezolid against bacteraemic methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains in Gauteng, South Africa ME J Coetzee1, C Feldman2, GA Richards2, AJ Brink1 1Ampath National Laboratory Services, Johannesburg, South Africa; 2Johannesburg Hospital and University of the Witwatersrand, Care 2009, 13(Suppl 1): P309 (doi: 10.1186/cc7473) Introduction This study aims to describe the vancomycin, teicoplanin and linezolid susceptibility patterns of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) blood culture isolates from patients in the private sector in Gauteng, South Africa.Screening tests for heterogeneous glycopeptide intermediate S. aureus (hGISA) strains were also performed. MRSA isolates with vancomycin minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 1 to2 mg/l are associated with worse clinical outcomes [1]. Further-more, hGISA infections are associated with clinical failure ofglycopeptide therapy [2].Methods MICs for vancomycin, teicoplanin and linezolid were performed on 50 randomly collected MRSA strains from bloodcultures according to Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute guide-lines. Screening for hGISA was performed using the Etest (ABBIODISK) Macromethod as well as the new Etest GlycopeptideResistance Detection.Available online http://ccforum.com/supplements/13/S1 Table 1 (abstract P309) 3 2Breakpoint S 2S 8S 4S128Results The results of susceptibility patterns are depicted in Table 1. Fifty percent (25/50) and 20% (10/50) of the strains screened positive for hGISA using the Etest Macromethod and Etest Glycopeptide Resistance Detection, respectively. Conclusions We recommend that clinically relevant MRSA isolates be reported with MICs for vancomycin, teicoplanin and linezolid, and that glycopeptide treatment failure warrants further testing of the MRSA isolate to detect possible hGISA. Ideally hGISA should be confirmed by population analysis profile testing, which was not available to us for this study. References 1.

P310 Telavancin for the treatment of hospital-acquired pneumonia in severely ill and older patients: the ATTAIN studies E Rubinstein1, GR Corey2, Medical MA, USA; Cl\u00ednic de Barcelona, Spain; 7Theravance, Inc., South San USA Critical 13(Suppl 1): P310 against Gram-positive pathogens. The Assess- ment of Telavancin for Treatment of Hospital-acquired Pneumonia (ATTAIN) programme studied TLV for the treatment of hospital- acquired pneumonia (HAP). This analysis compared the clinical cure rates achieved with TLV or vancomycin (VAN) for severely ill and older patients. Methods ATTAIN 1 and ATTAIN 2 were methodologically identical, randomised, double-blind, phase 3 studies. Adult patients with pneumonia acquired after 48 hours in an inpatient acute-care or chronic-care facility, or acquired within 7 days after being discharged following 3 days of hospital stay were randomised to TLV 10 mg/kg intravenously every 24 hours or VAN 1 g intra- venously every 12 hours for 7 to 21 days. A test-of-cure (TOC) visit was conducted 7 to 14 days after end-of-study treatment. Com- pliant patients who had a clinical response of either cure or failure at TOC were considered clinically evaluable (CE). Results Pooled clinical cure rates at TOC for several clinically relevant subgroups including the elderly as well as patients with severe HAP at baseline are presented in Figure 1. The percentage of patients reporting at least one treatment-emergent adverseevent was comparable between the TLV and VAN groups (80% vs. 79%, respectively). Conclusions Although not statistically significant, TLV achieved numerically higher cure rates than VAN for treatment of HAP in severely ill and older patients with comparable treatment-emergent adverse events. P311 Piperacillin/tazobactam administered by continuous or intermittent infusion for the treatment of nosocomial pneumonia L Lorente, S Palmero, J Jim\u00e9nez, J Iribarren, Galv\u00e1n, C Garc\u00eda, de 10.1186/cc7475) Introduction Betalactam efficacy is determined by the duration of time that concentrations remain above the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). Some studies have found that the adminis- tration of betalactams by continuous infusion maintains constant concentrations above the MIC of susceptible organisms over the course of therapy; but limited data exist on the clinical efficacy of betalactams administered by continuous infusion. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical efficacy of piperacillin/ tazobactam by continuous infusion (CI) administration or by intermittent infusion (II) for the treatment of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) caused by Gram-negative bacilli. Methods A retrospective cohort study (1 June 2002 to 31 December 2007) of patients with VAP caused by Gram-negative bacilli who received initial empiric antibiotic therapy with piperacillin/tazobactam. We analyzed two contemporary cohorts: one received piperacillin/tazobactam by CI (first received a loading dose of piperacillin/tazobactam 4/0.5 g over 30 minutes, and after 4/0.5 g infused over 360 minutes every 6 hours) and the other by II (4/0.5 g over 30 minutes every 6 hours). The administration of piperacillin/tazobactam by CI or II was prescribed according to the physician's discretion. Results Significant differences were not found between both groups of patients (37 with CI and 46 with II) in baseline data. Logistic regression analysis showed a higher probability of clinical cure of VAP by CI than by II (33/37 (89.2%) vs. 26/46 to 37.42; P= 0.001). Logistic regression analysis showed a higher probability of clinical cure of VAP by CI than by II when the microorganism causative of VAP had a MIC of 8 vs. 6/15 (40.0%); 1.01 to 588.24; P= 0.049) and a MIC of 16 g/ml (7/8 (87.5%) vs. 1/6 (16.7%); OR = 22.9; 95% CI = 1.19 to 1,880.78; P= 0.03); but not when it had a MIC of 4 g/ml (18/20 (90.0%) vs. 19/25 0.41). Conclusions Administration of piperacillin/tazobactam by con- tinuous infusion may have more clinical efficacy than administration by intermittent infusion for the treatment of nosocomial pneumonia.

The objective of this study was to determine the incidence of CVC-RB with rifampicin-miconazole-impregnated catheters access; and the cost of CVC-RB with both types of catheter. Methods A cohort study, conducted in a 24-bed polyvalent medical-surgical ICU of a university hospital. We included patients admitted to the ICU from 1 June 2006 to 30 September 2007, who underwent femoral venous catheterization. The cost of CVC- RB included the cost of antimicrobial agents and the diagnosis methods; but other costs were not included (such as prolongation of ICU stay, mechanical ventilation, extrarenal depuration, etc.). Results We inserted 73 RM-C during 634 catheter-days and 111 S-C during 927 catheter-days. We diagnosed eight CVC-RB in the S-C group and none in the RM-C group. The incidence of CVC-RB with RM-C was significantly lower than with S-C (0 vs. 8.62 per 1,000 catheter-days, OR = 0.13, 95% CI = 0.00 to 0.86; P = 0.03). The total cost in the RM-C group was \u20ac7,300 (73 central venous catheters (CVC) per \u20ac100 each CVC, and none CVC-RB), the mean cost per catheter was \u20ac100 (\u20ac7,300/73 CVC), and the mean cost per catheter-day was \u20ac11.51 (\u20ac7,300/634 CVC-days). The total cost in the group \u20ac15,330 (111 CVC per \u20ac30 each CVC = \u20ac3,330, more than \u20ac12,000 per the eight CVC-RB), the mean cost per catheter was \u20ac138 (\u20ac15,330/111 CVC), and the mean ( \u20ac15,330/927 CVC-days). femoral venous catheter-related bacteremia and are more efficient than standard catheters. P313 Micafungin for the treatment of pediatric invasive fungal infections NL Seibel2, TJ 1): P313 (doi: 10.1186/cc7477) Introduction Pediatric patients in the ICU are highly vulnerable to invasive fungal infections [1]; Candida has been reported to be the third most common pathogen in pediatric ICU wards [2]. However, information on new antifungal therapies in children remains limited. Micafungin (MICA) is a once-daily antifungal agent of the echinocandin class. Methods A retrospective review of MICA pediatric data from six trials. Results MICA was received by 296 children for (HSCT) patients, or to assess pharmacokinetics (PK). Most patients aged <1 year were premature (38/66), whereas most children aged >1 year were HSCT recipients or undergoing another therapy for a hematological malignancy (181/230). Maximum daily dose was similar for patients aged <1, 1 to 4, 5 to 8, 9 to 12 and 13 to 15 years with medians of 2.0, 1.5, 1.5, 1.9 and 1.5 mg/kg, respectively. Treatment success rates are shown in Figure 1. MICA showed linear PK, with a higher clearance in neonates than in older children and adults. Common adverse events (incidence 2%) were transient increases in transaminases, hypokalemia, hyperbili- rubinemia and alkaline phosphatase.Conclusions MICA is safe and efficacious agent for the treatment and prophylaxis of pediatric invasive fungal infections in the ICU setting.

P314 Malignant Boutonneuse fever with failure: a three-case series B Oliveira, AP Lacerda, Z Costa e Silva, C Fran\u00e7a Hospital de Santa Maria Lisboa, Portugal Critical of Boutonneuse fever, presents usually in a form considered benign, with serious complications in less than 10% of patients. Its mechanism of infection consists of vascular endothelial invasion by the microorganism and subsequent vasculitis and tissue necrosis. The process is usually localized or limited to the skin but can progress with malignant severe systemic involvement [1,2]. Methods A series of three cases of patients with multiple organ failure admitted to an ICU with confirmed diagnosis of Bouton- neuse fever is presented (positive serology or tissue PCR). Results Common to all the patients was the rapid development of the disease (average: 3 days) from the initial complaints of fever after a bite by an unidentified agent and development of generalized rash, and the diagnosis of multiple organ failure (average Simplified Acute Physiology Score II: 59; average Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score on admission: 12.6). All developed respiratory failure requiring invasive mechanical ventilation, haematological failure with haemolytic anaemia and acute renal failure suggestive of serious widespread vasculitis. One of the cases developed lethal refractory septic shock within 6 hours of admission. Tetracycline antibiotic therapy was started early in all patients, based on clinical and epidemiological data, since initial microbiological results were negative. Conclusions This series of cases illustrates the most severe form of Boutonneuse fever, usually associated with comorbidities such as diabetes, malignant disease, immunodeficiency or delay in the diagnosis and appropriate antibiotic therapy, which was not the case in these patients.Available online http://ccforum.com/supplements/13/S1 Figure 1 (abstract P313) S130References 1.

P315 Impact of microbiology and antimicrobial treatment on mortality in septic shock G Dabar1, G Jamaleddine2, P Yazbeck1, M Waked3 1Hotel Dieu Lebanon; University Hospital, Beirut, Lebanon; 3Saint 2009, 13(Suppl 1): P315 (doi: 10.1186/cc7479) Introduction Infectious characteristics, the infection source, and appropriate antibiotics are analyzed in relation to mortality in acohort of patients with severe sepsis and septic shock.Methods An observational and prospective cohort study over 1 year of all patients admitted to one of the adult ICUs of the threemajor university hospitals in Beirut. Demographics, appropriate ICUtherapies within 48 hours of admission, appropriate antibioticprescription within 48 hours of admission, antibiotic duration andnumber were registered. Infections were defined as definite orsuspected. The infectious source, microbial agents and anti-biograms were identified. Data were collected only during the ICUstay, and outcome was recorded at hospital discharge (alive ordead).Results One hundred and twenty-seven patients with an average age of 65 years were enrolled, 52% of admissions were from theemergency room and 83% were medical patients. Fifty-eightpercent of the patients had severe sepsis within 48 hours ofadmission. The average APACHE II and Sequential Organ FailureAssessment scores were 21 and 7, respectively. Immuno-deficiency was present in 30%. Overall mortality was 45%.Definite infection was diagnosed in 61% of the patients andbacteremia in 31.5%. Appropriate antibiotic prescription wassignificantly higher in patients with less severe sepsis comparedwith severe sepsis (>1 organ failure). Mortality was significantlyhigher in patients prescribed a higher number of antibiotics whilethe length of antibiotic prescription was not different betweensurvivors and nonsurvivors. Escherichia coli (n = 14) was the most common isolate in blood cultures, followed by Candida ( n = 5). Fungal pathogens were significantly more associated withnosocomial infections and with mortality. Multiresistantpseudomonas was significantly more associated to mortalitycompared with extended spectrum beta lactamase or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus . Positive urine culture was protective of a higher organ failure score. In multivariate analysis,Gram-negative bacteria, a nosocomial source and immuno-deficiency were all associated with an increased risk of death.Conclusions Inappropriate antibiotic prescription is associated with more severe sepsis. Mortality is higher in nosocomial sepsis.Candida is a serious nosocomial agent in severe sepsis and isassociated with increased mortality as well as multiresistantpseudomonas aeruguinosa.P316 Do changes in ICU flora and their antibiotic susceptibility parallel changes in infection control and antibiotic use? I Grigoras, C Caramidaru, D Rusu, L Cotarlet, The usefulness of microbiological surveillance in ICU patients is under debate [1,2]. It can signal infection/colonizationsites, most frequent germs and their antibiotic susceptibility. Ourstudy aimed to investigate changes in the microorganism rate andtheir antibiotic susceptibility in ICU patients along with efforts tochange antibiotic practice and infection control policies in the ICU.Methods A prospective study was performed in a 19-bed mixed ICU in an emergency university hospital. Blood, catheters,respiratory secretions, surgical wound secretions and urine werecultured any time in the case of infection suspicion or every 4 to5 days in the case of patients with ICU length of stay >5 days.Cultures were counted no matter the infection or colonizationstatus. Antibiotic use was recorded as daily drug doses/100 beds(DDDs). The study included two time periods: January to June2007 (P1 - 839 admitted patients) and January to June 2008 (P2 -779 admitted patients). Comparison between the two periodsincluded overall and site-specific rates of positive cultures, patternsof germs, antibiotic susceptibility and antibiotic usage.Results The overall number of positive cultures decreased by 31.8% ( P <0.01) and per patient by 15% ( P <0.01) in P2 versus P1. Germ patterns changed little over time, most frequently foundbeing Staphylococcus aureus , Acinetobacter spp, coagulase- coagulase-negative staphylococci from the blood-stream decreased from 42% to 26% ( P = 0.01), but Acinetobacter spp. in the respiratory tract increased from 34.5% to 43%,concurrently with a reduction in Klebsiella spp from 12.7% to 3%. Antibiotic use decreased in P2 versus P1 (68.7 DDDsvs. 113.8 DDDs, P = 0.01). Ciprofloxacin dropped from first (P1) to seventh (P2) position (75% decrease) and resulted in adecrease in ciprofloxacin resistance of S. aureus from 94% to 46% ( P <0.01). Conclusions Changes in infection control policies and antibiotic use resulted in a decreased number of positive cultures in ICUpatients and a decline in antibiotic resistance in some strains.References1.

Ann Clin Microbiol protocol for septic shock: a prospective randomized clinical trial D Chamberlain Flinders AustraliaCritical should be initiated as rapidly as possible forsuspected severe infections in the presence of hypotension.Timing and delay of initial administration of effective antimicrobialtherapy is an important predictor of survival [1]. It is hypothesizedthat appropriate prehospital-initiated intravenous, broad-spectrumCritical Care March 2009 Vol 13 Suppl 1 29th International Symposium on Intensive Care and Emergency MedicineS131empiric antimicrobial therapy will reduce the delay of administration and will reduce mortality [2].Methods One hundred and ninety-eight patients meeting the criteria for septic shock on initial clinical presentation prehospitalwere randomized to receiving broad-spectrum intravenous anti-microbial therapy and fluid per guided protocol or to receivingintravenous fluid only.Results Out of 198 septic shock patients, 99 received prehospital antimicrobial therapy. Blood cultures were taken prior to adminis-tration. Both groups were comparable in all aspects. There were83 male and 26 female patients in the test group, and 79 male and20 female patients in the control group ( P=0.021). Mean age was 67.9 \u00b1 10.5 years in the test group and 63.8 \u00b1 11.0 years in thecontrol group ( P=0.186). The APACHE II score in the test group and in the control group was statistically not significant(P=0.661). In the test group 28%, compared with the control group 53%, of patients had community-acquired pneumonia(P=0.083). The mean intensive care stay in the test group was 6.8 \u00b1 2.1 days and in the control group it was 11.2 \u00b1 5.2 days(P=0.001). The first antimicrobial administration after emergency department admission time in the control group was 3.4 \u00b1 2.6hours ( P=0.02). The 28-day mortality rate was significantly reduced to 42.4% (test group) compared with 56.7% in thecontrol group ( P= 0.049, OR = 0.56; 95% CI = 0.32 to 1.00). Conclusions The adjuvant treatment of patients with a guided prehospital-initiated broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy withintravenous fluid reduces the delay in antimicrobial administrationand significantly reduces the 28-day mortality rate in patients withseptic shock.References1.

P318 Clinical experiment with the use of colistin for the treatment of multiresistant Acinetobacter baumanii M Leklite aerosolized colistin are being used increasingly, in the critical care setting, for treating patients withnosocomial infections due to multidrug-resistant Gram-negativebacteria. The objective of this study was to report our experienceof colistin use in multiresistant Acinetobacter baumanii . Methods A retrospective review of patients' charts for those admitted to the surgical intensive unit, between September 2007and September 2008. Infected patients with multiresistant acineto-bacter treated with intravenous and aerosolized colistin werereviewed.Results Fifteen patients were identified, 13 men and two women. The patients ranged in age from 21 to 65 years. The patients wereadmitted to intensive care for polytrauma (10 cases), chest trauma(three cases) and cerebrovascular accident (two cases). The maininfections were ventilator nosocomial pneumonia (100%), patients had normal renal function at the onset of antibiotic therapy. Fivepatients received colistin monotherapy, six patients receivedcombination therapy colistin with and four patients received colistin with teicoplanine.The was used at 4 mg/kg/day administered intravenouslyand aerolized colistin at 2 mg/kg for 8 to 16 days. A favourableresponse was observed in 12 cases. Overall mortality was threecases. Colistin induced reversible nephrotoxicity in one case and areversible neuropsychiatric event was observed in one case.Bacterial eradication was confirmed in 14 patients (93%).Conclusions Garnacho-Montero and colleagues reported that intravenous colistin was as effective as imipenem [1]. Our findingswith can be considered encouraging in first-dose pharmacokinetics sively used for treatment of severe infections. A dose of 7 mg/kg isrecommended to achieve a high peak serum concentration.However, its accumulation is associated with adverse reactions,notably renal injury. Knowledge of gentamicin pharmacokinetics incritically ill patients is therefore crucial to therapeutic success andprevention of toxicity.Methods Patients' demographic and clinical data were collected. We studied gentamicin pharmacokinetic data from patients treatedbetween January 2006 and June 2008 in two ICUs. Patients wereeligible if the gentamicin dose was selected to achieve high serumlevels (target concentration of 16 to 24 g/ml) and if pharmaco- kinetic data from such patients, specifically peak and trough levels,were measured after the first dose. The Sawchuk and Zaske one-compartment pharmacokinetic model [1] was used to calculate thegentamicin volume of distribution (Vd), maximum concentration(Cmax) and clearance.Results We studied 32 patients with a mean age of 63 years (24 men). Mean Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score was 7.65and the mean Charlson Only four patients had aVd equal to or less than 0.26 l/kg, usually found in the healthypopulation. We found no correlation between Vd and age,Charlson comorbidities score, Sequential Organ respectively). The presence of mechanical ventilationand septic shock had no influence on Vd ( P = 0.59 and P = 0.14, respectively). Women had a significantly higher mean Vd/kg (0.51vs. 0.39 l/kg, P = 0.002) and, therefore, lower Cmax (15.2 vs. 18.5 g/ml, P = 0.016). In a logistic regression model, only sex (female: OR = 0.032; 95% CI = 0.03 to 0.387) and the dose/kg(per mg/kg: OR = 3.21; 95% CI = 1.17 to 8.79) were significantlyassociated with the achievement of Cmax above 16 g/ml.Available online http://ccforum.com/supplements/13/S1S132Conclusions The gentamicin Vd cannot be predicted by age, the presence of renal failure or any studied comorbidities. Therefore, inorder to obtain adequate therapeutic levels as soon as possible, ahigh first gentamicin dose (that is, at least 7 mg/kg) should begiven to all patients. In women, even higher doses may be needed.Reference1. Sawchuk R, Zaske D: Pharmacokinetics of dosing Biopharm 1976, 4:183-195. P320 Does early appropriate antibiotic therapy improve the outcome of severe sepsis or septic shock? N Saito, Y Sakamoto, K Mashiko Chiba 1): P320 (doi: 10.1186/cc7484) Introduction The Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guideline 2008 [1] recommends starting appropriate antibiotic therapy within 1 hourafter making the diagnosis of septic shock. In the ICU of ouremergency center, we perform empiric antibiotic therapy for septicshock patients within 6 hours after admission.Methods Cases of severe sepsis or septic shock diagnosed and treated in the ICU of our emergency center for more than 48 hoursbetween January 2005 and September 2008 were retrospectivelyanalyzed. The cases were divided into a survival group and anonsurvival group, and were compared in relation to primarydiagnosis, clinical findings, and type of pathogen. The chi-squaretest and paired ttest were used to perform the statistical analysis. Results There were 107 cases, 24 cases of severe sepsis and 83 cases of septic shock, and 73 of them were in males. The mean andstandard deviation of the patients' age was 66.4 \u00b1 15 years. Theseverity of their illness according to the APACHE II score was 22.3 \u00b18, and their Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score was 9.1 \u00b1 4.The causes of the sepsis were pneumonia (51.4%), peritonitis(13.1%), and soft tissue infection (13.1%). Mortality was 26.2%.There were 79 cases in the survival group and 28 in the nonsurvivalgroup. The two groups are presented in Table 1. We performed amultivariate regression analysis to identify prognostic factors, and theonly independent prognostic factors were age (OR = 0.955(P= 0.022; 95% CI = 0.91 to 0.99)), acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS) (OR = 5.789 ( P= 0.002; 95% CI = 1.91 to deficit (OR = 1.113 ( P= 0.008; 95% CI = 1.02 to 1.2)). Early appropriate antibiotic therapy (EAAT) was not correlated withsurvival. Table 1 (abstract P320) Survival Nonsurvival Pvalue antibiotic therapy (%) 39.2 0.351 Conclusions EAAT did not affect the outcome. The prognostic factors for severe sepsis and septic shock identified in this studywere age, base deficit and ARDS.References1.

Theroutine use of antibiotics in this situation determines a high-pressure selection for multiresistant microorganisms. However,how often AWA is the causative situation for early ventilator-associated pneumonia is not known. Also a gold standard for adiagnostic workup is needed. Our aim was to know how frequentAWA determines infectious aspiration pneumonia confirmed byevolution and microbiological samples, and to propose amethodological approach to rule out antibiotic usage.Methods Over a 2-year period, in 82 patients admitted to our ICU, AWA was confirmed by the direct observation of gastric contentwhen orotracheal intubation was performed by a trained physiciandue to a Glasgow coma scale below 12. Usual diagnosis: acutebrain injury, 52 patients (73%); Simplified Acute Physiology ScoreII 37 \u00b1 11; age, 44 \u00b1 15 years; all mechanically 6 \u00b1 radiology and PaO 2/FiO2were recorded on a daily basis. The Clinical Pulmonary Infection Score (CPIS) andsemiquantitative tracheal aspirates (SQTA) were performed twice: inthe first 48 hours and between the third and fifth days.Results Out of 82 patients, 23 (28%) developed clinically and microbiologically confirmed pneumonia. Fever and leukocytosisshowed no significant differences in patients with or withoutpneumonia during the first 5 days. Also the PaO 2/FiO2index was not different. As for radiology, when unilateral focal condensationwas present, pneumonia was confirmed later (relative risk = 3.3,95% CI = 1.7 to 6.4). CPIS in the first 48 hours showed a negativepredictive value for pneumonia of 89%, and SQTA with nomicroorganism growth a negative predictive value of 96%. In ourpatient group, 42 (51%) had CPIS <6 and SQTA growth; in themno antibiotic usage is recommended. On the contrary, out of 20patie nts who had CPIS 6 and positive SQTA, 16 (75%) developed pneumonia within the first 5 days of the ICU stay; this groupdeserves antibiotics. CPIS 6 without pneumonia, probably due to lung inflammation, was observed in 10 out of 28 patients (36%).Conclusions (1) In our ICU population, pneumonia develops in only 28% of those presenting with AWA. (2) Through CPIS <6and negative SQTA performed in the first 48 hours we couldidentify that in more than one-half of AWA patients antibiotics arenot needed. (3) CPIS is not a reliable early indicator of pneumoniain patients with AWA. P322 Effect of intravenous administration of freeze-dried sulfonated human normal immunoglobulin for septic patients Y Deguchi1, Nakagawa1, H Nishina1, T Sato1, 1Tokyo Medical University, Tokyo, cytokine TNF plays a critical role in the formation of severe sepsis when it is excessively released.Critical Care March 2009 Vol 13 Suppl 1 29th International Symposium on Intensive Care and Emergency MedicineS133Recently, it was revealed through our animal models that intra- venous administration of factor 1 (IGF-1) production throughstimulation of sensory nerves, which inhibits the production of TNF.In this study, we examined whether IVIG for septic patientsenhances IGF-1 production.Methods Fourteen septic patients indicating a high level of soluble E-selectin were surveyed, who were transported to our hospitalfrom April to November 2007. They were divided into two groups,IVIG group (G-group, 5 g/day x 3 days, nine cases, 67.2 \u00b1 8.64years old) and nonadministered group (control group, 69 \u00b1 12.9 years old).Results In the G-group, the values of IGF-1 on the fifth day day (150.44 \u00b1 that on day (88.59 \u00b1 29.79 ng/ml,P<0.05). Furthermore, (162.22 \u00b1 52.91 ng/ml) (68.80 \u00b1 24.04 ng/ml) on the fifth day ( P <0.05). Conclusions We revealed that IVIG for septic patients enhances IGF-1 production. Furthermore we will enhance the effect ofsulfanated immunoglobulin compared with that of intact immuno-globulin in the difference of the anti-inflammatory effect and K, Harada plasma soluble E-selectin predicts the development ofacute respiratory distress syndrome in patients with sys-temic inflammatory response syndrome.

P323 Levels of soluble fibrin in severe septic patients given intravenous immunoglobulin T Kobayashi1, T Nishiura2, H Suga2, T Nakagawa2 Tokyo Women Medical University Medical Center East, Tokyo, JapanCritical Care 2009, 13(Suppl 1): P323 (doi: 10.1186/cc7487) Introduction It is known that severe sepsis causes multiple organ failure and high mortality. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) isused for severe sepsis patients. The mechanism of IVIG is clearlyunknown. Suggested, however, is the possibility that IVIG preventsorganic injury by suppressing the inflammation. Soluble fibrin (SF)is intermediate between fibrinogen and fibrionoligomer. It is betterthan fibrinogen as the material for thrombin. IVIG is used as one ofthe effective factors for repair of the damaged vascular endo-thelium. In this study we used SF as a marker of severity of illnessin patients with or without IVIG and compared the levels of SF intwo groups.Methods Nineteen severe septic patients were divided into two groups. The control group ( n= 9) was not given and the other group ( n= 10) was given IVIG (5 g/day for 3 days). SF of serum from patients was measured on 0 days, 1 day, 3 days, 5 days and7 days, and the results were analyzed.Results The levels of SF were: control group: 4.77 \u00b1 (0 days), 3.13 \u00b1 3.33 \u00b1 2.75 (3 days), 2.53 \u00b1 2.58(5 days), 2.58 \u00b1 3.75 (7 9.08(5 days), 11.95 \u00b1 12.71 (7 days). There was a significantdifference in the levels of SF between groups with and without IVIG at 1 day, 5 days and 7 days.Conclusions Monocyte has the Fc receptor. It is thought that stimulating Fc of monocyte with IgG plays a role in increasing SF. Without severe DIC, increasing fibrin is used in the repair of thedamaged vascular endothelium as a matrix and it prevents theinvasion of germs. It is thought that increasing fibrin is theappropriate stimulation for coagulation and one of the reactions ofbiomechanical defense. We think SF is one of the importantfactors for the damaged cell and a useful marker of severity forsevere sepsis. We also think IVIG is effective for severe sepsis.Reference1.

P324 Efficacy of corticosteroids on survival in patients with sepsis and septic shock: meta-analysis N Uchiyama, N Nishimura, T Jinta, 1): P324 (doi: 10.1186/cc7488) Introduction Previous studies have recommended the use of low- dose corticosteroids in patients with septic shock. Specifically,response to corticotropin tests has been recognized as aprognostic factor in critically ill patients, especially in patients withno response to the corticotropin test. A recent large randomizedcontrolled trial evaluating the efficacy of low-dose corticosteroidsrevealed no benefit on overall survival or in patients with noresponse to corticotropin in patients with severe sepsis and septicshock. Recently, recommendations for the diagnosis and manage-ment of corticosteroid insufficiency in critically ill adult patientswere published as consensus statements from an international taskforce by the American College of Critical Care Medicine [1].However, some studies were not included in these statements.Methods We conducted a systematic search of EMBASE and MEDLINE (through August 2008) for double-blind randomizedclinical trials that evaluated the effect of corticosteroids onmortality in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock. Studyselection criteria were all trials before August 2008 in whichparticipants were randomized to corticosteroids or placebo and inwhich mortality was reported.Results Data from 17 randomized, controlled trials with a total of 3,638 participants were analyzed. Corticosteroid use was notassociated with a risk reduction in overall mortality (pooled riskratio = 0.99 (95% CI = 0.90 to 1.09), P = 0.823). Low-dose corticosteroids (150 to 300 mg/day) did not show benefit on all-cause mortality in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock(risk ratio = 0.92 (95% CI = 0.79 to 1.06)). Furthermore, low-dosecorticosteroids in patients with severe sepsis and septic shockwho did not respond to the corticotropin test showed no benefit on28-day mortality (risk ratio = 0.91 (95% CI = 0.76 to 1.09)).Corticosteroids use was not associated with increased compli-cations, such as gastrointestinal bleeding or increased infections.Conclusions This meta-analysis indicated that administration of low-dose corticosteroids was not beneficial on overall mortality inpatients with severe sepsis or septic shock.Reference1.

Thisis explained as an increased incidence of superinfection, includingnew episodes of sepsis or septic shock, but the explanation seemsto be unclear so there are still debates about the study. Weexamined the outcome of HC therapy and the effect on laterinfectious complications, especially fungal infection.Methods A retrospective cohort study. Ninety-six adult patients >18 years old with septic shock treated at single university generalICU. Initially, fluid therapy, inotropic support, transfusion andmanagement of infection were carried out according to theguideline of survival sepsis campaign, and we assessed theadrenal function by adrenocorticotropic hormone stimulation test(250 g). In the earlier period (April 2004 to March 2007), 200 mg HC was administered to the nonresponders. Later (April 2007onwards), HC was given only to patients that were poorlyresponsive to fluid resuscitation and vasopressor therapy. Weassessed the 28-day and 90-day survival rate, hospital dischargerate, the incidence of new septic shock, the positive rate ofendotoxin and - D-glucan. Results Out of 96 patients, 38 patients were determined as responders and 58 as nonresponders. The Sequential OrganFailure Assessment score was higher in nonresponders (11 \u00b1 3.3vs. 13.6 \u00b1 3.7, P = 0.0014). For the 58 nonresponders, HC was used for 40 patients (HC group). The survival rate washigher in HC non-HC 44%, P = 0.49), the survival rate to 33% in HC and 28% in non-HC(P= 0.47), and the discharge rate as 25% in HC versus 28% in non-HC ( P = 0.84). The incidence of new septic shock was 20% in HC, 11% in non-HC. The positive rate of endotoxindid not increase before and after treatment in both groups. Themean concentration of - D-glucan did not increase in non-HC (59 \u00b1 99 to 48 \u00b1 44 pg/ml), but it significantly increased in HC(50 \u00b1 70 to 69 \u00b1 186 pg/ml) ( P = 0.049). Conclusions The 28-day survival rate was higher in the HC group than the non-HC group as reported in the French study, but nobeneficial effect was seen in longer outcome, consistent with theCORTICUS study. Moreover, HC therapy may have a risk toincrease fungal infection. P326 Effects of methylprednisolone on sepsis-induced blood-brain barrier permeability and reflex responsiveness in rats F T Erdem1, A Ogan2, E 1): P326 (doi: 10.1186/cc7490) Introduction The purpose of this study was to assess neurological function and examine blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeabilitychanges in septic encephalopathy after high-dose on BBB derangement and neurological dysfunction was also investigated.Methods An experimental prospective randomized study was performed on 42 adult male Sprague-Dawley rats. Sepsis wasinduced through CLP. A bolus 30 mg/kg methylprednisoloneadministration followed by intravenous injection of 5.4 mg/kg/hourfor 8 hours was given immediately after CLP in septic and sham-operated rats. Control groups for both septic and sham-operatedrats were injected with equal volumes of saline.Results Neurological function was assessed at 8, 12, and 24 hours after sepsis induction. Those rats surviving for 24 hours postprocedure were anesthetized and decapitated for investigation ofBBB integrity using a spectrophotometric assay of Evans blue dyeextravasations. A significant decrease in neurological function anda significant increase in BBB permeability were observed with theinduction of sepsis compared with the sham-operated controls.Administration of methylprednisolone caused a significantlyimproved reflex responsiveness and decreased brain tissue Evansblue dye content in septic rats.Conclusions The present investigation shows that methylpred- nisolone administered immediately after sepsis induction via CLP isassociated with better neurologic scores, which might be relatedto its positive effects on sepsis-induced BBB pulmonaryinflammation in a mouse model Hegeman1, PM Cobelens1, 13(Suppl 1): P327 (doi: 10.1186/cc7491) Introduction Mechanical ventilation (MV) may evoke damage to healthy lungs leading to ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI). Wehypothesized that downregulation of pulmonary inflammation mayattenuate VILI. The present study investigated whether lung inflam-mation and injury can be restored by dexamethasone (Dex). Toprevent the systemic negative side effects of free Dex, we targetedDex by delivering anti-E-selectin Dex liposomes into activatedendothelium of inflamed lungs.Methods Mice were tracheotomized and ventilated in the pressure control mode for 5 hours with 50% oxygen levels, 2 cmH 2O positive end-expiratory pressure and 12 cmH2O peak inspiratory pressure (lung protective, LP-MV) or 20 cmH2O peak inspiratory pressure (lung injurious, LI-MV). isotype IgG Dex liposomeswere given systemically at initiation of MV. After 5 hours, lung injurywas determined by arterial oxygen levels, tissue edema andbronchoalveolar lavage protein levels. bronchoalveolar lavage protein levels ascompared with LP-MV, suggesting that lung function wasdeteriorated by LI-MV. Both MV strategies enhanced pulmonaryinflammation. Anti-E-selectin Dex liposomes and free Dex, but alsoIgG Dex liposomes, reduced ventilator-induced lung inflammation.However, Dex treatment did not diminish lung injury.Conclusions Systemic administration of targeted and free Dex attenuates VILI-associated pulmonary inflammation, but not lung injury.Critical Care March 2009 Vol 13 Suppl 1 29th International Symposium on Intensive Care and Emergency MedicineS135P328 Relative adrenal insufficiency in cardiopulmonary bypass surgery patients: impact on the postoperative hemodynamic status J Jimenez, J Iribarren, M Brouard, L Lorenzo, L Lorente, R Perez, N Perez, L Raja, R Martinez, Universitario Introduction The objective of this study was to determine the incidence and risk factors for relative adrenal insufficiency (RAI) incardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) patients and the impact onpostoperative hemodynamic status.Methods A prospective cohort study was performed on elective CPB patients on a 24-bed ICU of a tertiary university hospital. RAIwas defined as a rise in serum cortisol 9g/dl after the adminis- tration of 250 g cosyntropin. Plasma cortisol levels were measured preoperatively, immediately before and 30 minutes, 60 minutes and90 minutes after the administration of cosyntropin (250 g). Results We included 120 from 137 consecutive patients, of whom 17 met criteria for exclusion (eight off-pump, two surgicalemergencies, two with endocarditis, five corticoid dependency).We studied (70%) males and 36 (30%) females. Mean age67 \u00b1 12 years. Plasma cortisol levels were measured pre-operatively, immediately before, 30, 60, and 90 minutes after theadministration of cosyntropin and at 24 postoperative 9 g/dl) incidence was 77.5%. Etomidate was the only independent risk factor associated with RAI (OR = 8.51, 95%CI = 3.09 to 23.42). RAI patients needed more vasopressorrequirements just after surgery ( P= 0.04), and at 4 hours ( P= 0.01). Pretest and post-test plasma cortisol levels were inversely associated with maximum norepinephrine dose in thesame time respectively). Conclusions RAI and lower cortisol levels in CPB patients induce postoperative vasopressor dependency. Use of etomidate in thesepatients is a modifiable risk factor for the development of RAI thatshould be avoided. P329 Adrenal gland evaluation in septic shock patients: preliminary results of the first CT-scan study B Jung, S Nougaret-Jung, G Chanques, S Aufort, common in septic shock patients, itsdiagnosis and management remain controversial [1,2]. The recentconsensus conference on CIRCI reported that baseline total serumcortisol and that after 250 g synthetic ACTH is insufficient to evaluate the adrenal response to sepsis [1]. To our knowledge, there is no CT-scan study that has evaluated adrenal gland imagingduring septic shock. The aim of our study was to describe theadrenal gland volume evaluated by CT scan during septic shock.Methods A single-center study during 1 year. Two groups of patients who benefited from an abdominal CT scan were studied.Patients who presented septic shock, an ACTH test and anabdominal CT scan in the 72 hours before or after the onset ofshock were included in the group septic shock (shock +). Patientswho benefited from an abdominal CT scan but did not present anyshock were included in the group nonshock (shock -). CIRCI wasdefined as a delta serum total cortisol less than 9 g/dl after an ACTH test of 250 g. The main endpoint was the total adrenal gland volume with semiautomatic software(Myriane Intrasense, Montpellier, France).Results In the preliminary results we compared 66 patients in septic shock with 20 patients without any shock. In the septicshock group, the Simplified Acute Physiology Score II score was46 (40 to 56) and mortality in the ICU was 36%. The total adrenalgland volume is presented in Table 1. The ACTH test was notevaluable in four patients in the group septic shock leading us toanalyse 62 patients.Conclusions Our preliminary results showed for the first time that in septic shock the total adrenal gland volume is three to four timeshigher than in nonseptic patients. The diagnosis and outcomeimpact of this increase volume should be better evaluated.References1.

P331 Statin therapy in patients admitted to hospital with presumed infection P Kruger1, M Harward1, J Helyar1, B Venkatesh2, M Jones2 Hospital, 2009, 13(Suppl 1): P331 (doi: 10.1186/cc7495) Introduction Several studies, largely retrospective, have suggested improved outcomes and a reduction in inflammatory response inpatients who develop infection whilst on statin therapy. This studyreports outcomes for patients on established statin therapyadmitted to hospital with presumed infection compared with thosepatients not on a statin.Methods The study was approved by the Princess Alexandra Hospital Research Ethics Committee and conducted from May2006 to October 2008 as part of a randomised controlled studyinvestigating continuing established statin therapy. A dailycomputer-generated report identified all patients admitted tohospital with a potential diagnosis of infection.Results From a total of 2,291 patients screened, 2,239 were considered to have presumed infection. Of these, 2,161 wereaged >30 years and were included in the final analysis (statin users =633, no statin use = 1,528). The statin group was significantlyolder with a mean age (\u00b1 SD) of 69 \u00b1 12 versus 61 \u00b1 16 years(P= 0.0001) and included more men (62.1% vs. 55.2%, P= 0.004). The source of presumed infection was not statistically different between the groups (overall chi-square P= 0.16). A presumed respiratory source was the most common in bothgroups (statin 35.5% vs. urosepsis(13.0 vs. and other sources (14.7 vs. 16.8%). Two or moreSIRS criteria was seen in 65.4% of the statin group patients and67.8% of the no statin group ( P= 0.30). Hospital mortality was similar in statin group and 6.5% no statingroup, P= 0.64), as was the rate of statin group and 16% no statin group; P= 0.63). Hospital length of stay was not significantly different between the groups(11.4 \u00b1 15.4 days in the statin group and 12.5 \u00b1 26.2 days in theno statin group, P= 0.10). Conclusions In a heterogeneous cohort of patients admitted to hospital with presumed infection, prior statin therapy was notassociated with an improved outcome or reduced systemic inflam-matory response. The age and gender differences observed are inkeeping with previous literature and support the assertion thatstatin users represent a different patient group to those not using statin therapy. P332 Evolution of inflammation in non-ICU patients with infections: pilot prospective cohort study A Donnelly1, Adhikari2, Z Thomas's Hospital, London, UK; 2Sunnybrook Health 1): P332 (doi: 10.1186/cc7496) Introduction Statins may prevent organ dysfunction in patients with infections, but the optimal time for this therapy is unknown.Our objective was to determine the evolution of inflammation inpatients treated for infection on general wards and the impact ofprevious statin use.Methods We performed a single-centre prospective cohort study (April to September 2008) in unselected patients admitted tomedical wards with infection, collecting data on demographics,comorbidities, and statin use before admission; and 10-day follow-up data on intensive care or high-dependency unit (ICU/HDU)admission and death, systemic inflammatory response syndrome(SIRS) criteria and organ dysfunction (using a modified SequentialOrgan Failure Assessment (SOFA) score), and infection markers(C-reactive protein (CRP), white blood cells (WBC)). WBC and CRP were analysed descrip-tively; continuous data are expressed as the mean (SD) or median(Q1 to Q3). The effect of statins was explored in regressionmodels accounting for within-patient correlation, with P <0.05 taken as statistically significant.Results Two hundred and nine patients were admitted with infections (lung 51.0%, urinary (20.7), 49.8% score (1 to 3), previous statin users27.8%, WBC 15.6 (12.0) x 10 9/l, mg/l. On admission, 88.9% had 1 SIRS criterion (median 2 (1 to 3)) and 72.3% had modified SOFA score 1 (median 1 (0 to 2)), with no statin versus non-statin group differences. CRP, WBC, and theproportion of patients with 1 SIRS criterion and modified SOFA score 1 decreased over time ( P <0.0001), but generalized linear mixed models showed no effect of statins ( P = 0.98, 0.51, 0.55, and 0.25) when adjusted for time, age, sex, and Charlson score.By day 10, seven patients were admitted to the ICU/HDU, fourpatients had died, and 64 patients had 1 day with a higher modified SOFA score versus admission. Overall, 35.9% of patientsdeveloped this combined outcome (statin (44.8%) vs. non-statin(32.5%); OR = 1.66, 95% CI = 2.85 to 3.25 after adjustment forage, sex, Charlson score).Conclusions Ward patients with infection often develop some organ dysfunction, but the risk of death/higher care is low. Trials of statins toprevent such clinically important outcomes would need to be large. P333 Heart rate variability in Egyptian children with acute rheumatic fever MM Farid, M Abd Elmonim, M Elganzoury, M Abou Elmaaty, O YoussefFaculty of Medicine - Ain Care 2009, 13(Suppl 1): P333 (doi: 10.1186/cc7497) Introduction Autonomic dysfunction in relation to cardiovascular system morbidity and mortality has been reported. The objective ofCritical Care March 2009 Vol 13 Suppl 1 29th International Symposium on Intensive Care and Emergency MedicineS137this study was to study cardiac autonomic balance and heart rate variability (HRV) indices in acute rheumatic fever.Methods A prospective study was conducted on three groups. Group I included 20 patients with acute rheumatic carditis. GroupII included 20 patients with no cardiac involvement (10 with chorea(Group IIa) and 10 with arthritis (Group IIb)). Group I included 10in failure (Group Ia) and 10 compensated (Group Ib). Group IIIincluded 20 healthy controls. Plasma norepinephrine (NE) assay,echocardiography, cardiovascular autonomic function tests(5AFTs) and forarrhythmias and HRV. Studied HRV variables included thestandard deviation of all normal RR intervals (SDNN) and thepercentage of differences between adjacent normal RR intervalsthat are greater than 50 ms (PNN50).Results Group I had significantly higher values for 5AFTs score, NE, supraventricular premature beats (SVPBS) and ventricularpremature beats (VPBS) ( P<0.001). Measured variables were more affected in Group Ia compared with Group Ib (Table 1) and inpatients with heart failure New York Heart Association class IVcompared with class Group III.Conclusions Acute rheumatic carditis is associated with significant autonomic dysfunction. HRV indices can be used forrisk stratification in those patients. P334 Recombinant human activated protein C reduces cardiac 3-nitrotyrosine and malondialdehyde levels in ovine acute respiratory distress syndrome and septic shock MO Maybauer, DM Maybauer, JF Fraser, L Kiss, Introduction We have recently shown that recombinant human activated protein C (rhAPC) improved pulmonary function [1] andcardiac performance [2] in ovine acute respiratory distresssyndrome Peroxynitrite (ONOO -) is known to inactivate adrenoreceptors in sepsis. It can be detected with equalamounts of 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT). rhAPC has been effective toreduce levels in sepsis [1]. We therefore hypothesizedthat rhAPC might reduce cardiac 3-NT levels as well, and studiedcellular enzymes involved with the ONOO -pathway in cardiac tissue.Methods Fifteen sheep (33 to 38 kg) were operatively prepared for chronic study and randomly allocated to either the sham (un-injured, untreated), control (injured) or treatment (rhAPC) groups(n= 5 each). After a tracheotomy, acute lung injury was produced in the control and rhAPC groups by insufflation of cotton smoke,followed by instillation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteria into the lungs according to an established protocol [1]. The sheepwere studied for 24 hours in the awake state and ventilated withFiO 21.0. In the treatment group, rhAPC (24 g/kg/hour) was intra- venously administered, beginning 1 hour post injury. Heart tissue3-NT, myeloperoxidase (MPO), and malondialdehyde (MDA)contents were measured (ELISA) after 24 hours. Data presentedas the mean \u00b1 SEM; *significance, P <0.05. Results After 24 hours, 3-NT levels (nM/ml/mg) were 19 \u00b1 3 in sham and were significantly increased in the control group (101 \u00b111*). The rhAPC group (22 \u00b1 18*) showed significantly lower 3-NTtissue levels then controls. MDA levels ( M/ml/mg) were 48 \u00b1 5 in sham and were significantly increased in the control group (85 \u00b13*). The rhAPC group (41 \u00b1 3*) showed significantly lower MDAtissue levels then controls. The MPO activity (mU/mg) showed nodifferences between groups: sham (180 \u00b1 rhAPC (210 \u00b1 20), respectively.Conclusions rhAPC has no influence on cardiac MPO levels, but significantly reduced heart tissue 3-NT and MDA levels in ovineacute respiratory distress syndrome and septic shock, therebyimproving cardiac performance. These findings may lead to furtherinvestigations of rhAPC and cardiovascular function.References1.

P335 Altered plasma proteome during an early phase of an experimental model of peritonitis-induced sepsis T Karvunidis1, V Thongboonkerd2, W Chiangjong2, 2Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand; 13(Suppl 1): P335 (doi: 10.1186/cc7499) Introduction The pathophysiology and molecular mechanisms involved in sepsis are complex and poorly understood. Weperformed a proteomics study to characterize early host responsesto sepsis as determined by altered plasma proteome in a porcinemodel of peritonitis-induced sepsis.Methods In seven instrumented and mechanically ventilated pigs, sepsis was induced by inoculating autologous faeces. Haemo-dynamics, oxygen exchange, inflammatory responses, oxidative andnitrosative stress, and other laboratory parameters were monitored.Plasma samples were obtained before and 12 hours after theinduction of hyperdynamic sepsis. Plasma proteins were resolvedby two-dimensional electrophoresis.

MS identified 35 protein forms representing 22 unique proteins whose plasma levels were increased, whereas 12 forms of eight unique proteins were significantly decreased during sepsis. Conclusions We identified a set of plasma proteins with significantly altered levels during an early phase of sepsis in a porcine model of peritonitis-induced sepsis using a proteomics approach. Most of these altered proteins have important roles in the inflammatory response. Some findings are novel, and exploring their roles may lead to the identification of new therapeutic targets.

P336 Increased epithelial apoptosis and decreased oxidant injury in silymarin-treated rats with sepsis-induced acute lung injury S Canikli, N S Turkoglu, O Ozen, M Unlukaplan, A Pirat Baskent University School of Medicine, Turkey Critical Care 2009, 13(Suppl 1): P336 (doi: 10.1186/cc7500) Introduction Studies have demonstrated thistle) has cytoprotective effects and induces apoptosis. We hypothe- sized that silymarin decreases sepsis-induced acute lung injury (ALI) in a cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) rat model through its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. Methods Forty-eight rats were randomized to n= 16), and silymarin ( n= 16) groups. ALI was induced with CLP in the control and silymarin groups. Animals in the silymarin group received silymarin 50 mg/kg/day for 3 days before the experiment and 2 days afterward. Serum and bronchoalveolar lavage and lung wet-to-dry (w/d) weight ratio measurements were used to compare and evaluate the severity of lung injury between the groups. Apoptosis was quantitated using paraffin sections of lung by fluorescent terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling. Survival analyses were also performed. Results Mortality rates for the silymarin and control groups were 37.5% and 87.5%, respectively (log-rank P= 0.0503). Compared with the silymarin group, the control group exhibited significantly more severe lung injury, as indicated by higher mean values for serum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid TNF (P= IL-6 glutathione levels were significantly higher in the silymarin group than the control group ( P= 0.001). Compared with the control group, induction of apoptosis was increased in the silymarin group (P= 0.003). Conclusions Silymarin reduces the severity of sepsis-induced ALI and may also improve survival in a CLP rat model. These beneficial effects of this agent are probably due to its inhibitory effects on the inflammatory process and oxidative injury and its proapoptotic effect. P337 Effect of nattokinase supplementation on plasma fibrinogen levels, whole blood viscosity and mortality in experimental sepsis in rats M Cengiz1, M Yilmaz1, A Ramazanoglu1, S 1Akdeniz University, Antalya, Turkey; 2Keck School of Medicine, Los Angeles, CA, USA Critical Care 2009, 13(Suppl 1): P337 (doi: from fermen- tation of boiled soy bean that has a potent fibrinolytic effect [1]. The aim of this experimental study was to investigate the effects of nattokinase on plasma fibrinogen levels, whole blood viscosity and mortality in rats with sepsis. Methods Fifty adult female Wistar rats were used in the study. Nattokinase (6 mg/day) was given via the intragastric route for 7 days. Sepsis was induced by cecal ligation-puncture. Analysis of plasma fibrinogen levels, whole blood viscosity and survival was performed. Results Mean plasma fibrinogen levels of rats that received nattokinase prior to cecal ligation-puncture were lower than the others that did not receive nattokinase prior to cecal ligation- puncture and the sham-operated group, but the differences were not statistically significant. Mean blood viscosity of rats analyzed with the Rheolog scanning capillary viscometer was lower in the nattokinase-supplemented animals cecal group at a ( P <0.05) (Figure 1). Nattokinase supplementation did not significantly influence survival rates and survival times of the rats after cecal ligation-puncture. Conclusions The results of our in vivo study were not sufficient to prove the fibrinogenolytic effect of nattokinase but confirmed the results of a previous in vitro study investigating the effect of nattokinase on blood viscosity. More in vivo and in vitro studies with large study populations are required to investigate the use of nattokinase to prevent and treat sepsis-related disseminated intravascular coagulation.

Pneumonia in mechanically ventilated (MV) patients isoften complicated by the involvement of multidrug-resistant (MDR)Gram-negative bacteria [2]. This multinational study exploredphysicians' prescribing behaviour when treating Gram-negativepneumonia in MV patients.Methods Online interviews were conducted with 510 critical/ intensive care, infectious disease and pulmonary/respiratory specia-lists in the USA ( n= 130), Mexico ( n= 80) and Japan ( n= 100). Participants were practicing physicians (3 to 31 years), were involved in the management of MVpatients and were familiar with treatment strategies for pneumonia.Results The involvement of Gram-negative (vs. Gram-positive) bacteria in pneumonia in MV patients was perceived to carry greatermortality risks. Most physicians (63 to 77% in all countries exceptJapan; 41% in Japan) were extremely concerned about the impacton treatment outcomes of increasing antibiotic resistance in Gram-negative species. Excessive antibiotic use and failure to effectivelyde-escalate antibiotic therapy were perceived as key contributors toresistance development. Achieving rapid cure (78%) and minimizingthe duration of MV (76%) were cited as the most important aims oftreatment. Key considerations for antibiotic selection were activityagainst Gram-negative bacteria, including MDR strains, and relativeextent of lung tissue penetration. Over 80% of respondents sawaerosolized antibiotics as a valuable potential addition to the currenttreatment armamentarium (no antibiotic aerosols are currentlylicensed for pneumonia), particularly for elderly patients and thosewith respiratory distress, who are at risk of the worst outcomes.Conclusions Gram-negative pneumonia in MV patients is a serious complication in ICUs. Antibiotic prescribing for Gram-negativepneumonia among respondents is influenced by the risk of MDRbacterial involvement. Aerosolized antibiotics are seen as apotentially valuable adjunct to systemic therapies for treatingGram-negative pneumonia in MV patients.References1.

P339 Pilot proforma to aid the diagnosis of sepsis in burns patients T Evans, J McLennan Morriston Hospital, Swansea, UKCritical Care 2009, 13(Suppl 1): P339 (doi: 10.1186/cc7503) Introduction The aim was to produce and pilot a data collection proforma aiding the diagnosis of sepsis in the burns population. Itshould be relevant, reliable and lead to reproducible results. We also looked at the data collected to assess the relevance of anyfindings. In June 2007, the American Burn Association ConsensusConference [1] produced standardized definitions in an attempt toaid clarification of sepsis in those already fulfilling the diagnosis ofa systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). This wouldallow more consistent diagnosis and accuracy to further trialsoccurring in this field. The intention is that the proforma will beused by the INTERBURNS research group for a large prospectivestudy.Methods This was a retrospective case series. Patients included were those admitted to a regional burns unit with more than 20%burns during December 2007, numbering four. These patientswere matched for age, sex, and mechanism of injury. The initialproforma was produced on the basis of the American BurnAssociation recommendations [1]. Data were collected andreviewed. This revealed potential confounding factors, so theproforma was modified and data recollected. A daily diagnosis ofSIRS and sepsis was made from the information collected.Results Data were collected at 12 p.m. daily initially. It was noted that haemofiltration and noradrenaline were routinely used.Dressing changes occurred in the morning, leading to increasedanalgesia, sedation and the release of inflammatory mediatorsconfounding physiological parameters measured. Therefore theproforma was modified and the data recollected at 6 a.m. daily,thus achieving reliable and reproducible data. Despite the smallnumbers, the data indicated a potential association between anincrease in noradrenaline dose of 25% and either instigation of atreatment modality or a diagnosis of SIRS not previously identified,or both.Conclusions The proforma is reproducible and gives relevant reliable data for further analysis. The results have highlighted theneed for further research to clarify any association betweennoradrenaline and its place in the diagnosis of sepsis. Thisproforma and its subsequent utilisation by the INTERBURNSresearch group should improve our ability to diagnose sepsis andinstigate early treatment in this patient population.Reference1.

After a widespread 2-montheducational program, implementation of Surviving SepsisCampaign Resuscitation Bundles (RB) and Management Bundles(MB) were accomplished. A reinforcement educational programwas performed in October 2007. Patients were recruited fromSeptember 2005 to August 2008.Available online http://ccforum.com/supplements/13/S1S140Results We analyzed 384 episodes of septic shock. The mean age was 64.5 \u00b1 15 years, APACHE II score 23.2 \u00b1 7.2, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score 9.5 \u00b1 3, and global hospital mortality 37.5%. The rate of compliance with the RB was 35.4%. There were significant differences in mortality between compliant (C) and noncompliant (NC) groups despite the similar charac- teristics and the severity of septic shock. The mortality rate was 42.5% in the NC group and 23.6% in the C group. The compliance rate with MB was only 10%, there were no differences in mortality between C and NC groups (41% vs. 37%). When the influence of age, severity, emergency department origin, and ICU admission delay was controlled by multivariate analysis, compliance with RB was independently associated with survival (OR = 0.39, 95% CI = 0.22 to 0.70, P<0.01). Compliance rates with RB during three consecutive 12-month time periods were 34%, 23% and 45.4%, respectively ( inhospital periods were 37%, 47% and 31%, respectively (P= 0.03). Compliance with MB decreased from 20% (first period) to 3% (third period). Conclusions Implementation of RB was associated with decreased mortality in patients with septic shock. The compliance rate with MB was poor and had no impact on survival. Acknowledgements Supported by IFIMAV Expte. PRF/07/04 and the Carlos P341 Sepsis bundles: just think about it? A Cardinale, L Giunta, C Di Maria, C Pellegrini, P De Luca, G Di Salvio, T Russo, P Masturzo, E De Blasio Hospital P341 (doi: 10.1186/cc7505) Introduction The aim of the study is to verify the impact of the implementation of the diagnostic and therapeutic bundles suggested by Sepsis Surviving Campaign (SSC) [1] on the out- come of patients with severe sepsis and septic shock. Methods A retrospective analysis of the outcome of severe sepsis and septic shock patients before, during and after the implementation of the bundles according to the SSC in an eight- bed polyvalent ICU. We evaluated ICU and hospital mortality, the length of stay, the level of compliance to the bundles and its impact on the mortality. Statistical analysis was performed using the chi- square test.Results A total of 127 patients were enrolled from 2005 onwards (38 patients in 2005, 43 patients in 2006 and 46 patients in 2007). We observed a reduction of the overall ICU and hospital mortality from 73% to 43%, not statistically significant, even if the difference between the observed and predicted mortality showed a statistically significant improvement ( P= 0.027) (Figure 1). On the contrary, the length of stay [2] was 18 days in 2005, 23 days in 2006, 25 days in 2007. Our compliance was respectively 59% in 2006 and 55% in 2007 for resuscitation bundles and 58% in 2006 and 78% in 2007 for management bundles. The mortality was higher (70%) in the group with an overall compliance score 6 compared with 40% for those with a score 7. Conclusions Even though the main difficulty was to timely reach the targets of the bundles, the existence of a protocolized approach to severe sepsis and septic shock seems to contribute to the reduction of mortality in our population of patients.

Methods A single centre prospective observational study of surgical patients admitted to the ICU from September 2005 to August 2008 fulfilling criteria for the international sepsis definitions. Results We analyzed prospectively 149 surgical patients with septic shock. The mean age was 69 \u00b1 13 years, APACHE II score: 23 \u00b1 7, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment: 8 \u00b1 2. The mortality rate was 34.2% in the ICU and 42.3% in the hospital. There were no significant differences in the characteristics and the severity of septic shock between the compliant (C) and noncompliant (NC) groups. We found differences in the ICU and hospital mortality between the C and NC groups in two Resuscitation Bundles (RB): P<0.001 and 24% vs. 63%, P<0.001, respectively). The compliance rate of all RB was 27% and there were significant differences in mortality between the C and NC groups (17% vs. 40%, P= 0.01 and 35% vs. 49%, P= 0.009 in the ICU and hospital, respectively). There were no significant differences in the ICU and hospital mortality with the Management Bundles compliance. In the multivariate analysis, source control, ScvO2 70%, compliance of all RB, mechanical ventilation, APACHE II and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment were independently associated with mortality. When the influence of age and severity was controlled by logistic regression, source control wasCritical Care March 2009 Vol 13 Suppl 1 29th International Symposium on Intensive Care and Emergency Medicine Figure 1 (abstract P341) Severe sepsis and septic shock hospital mortality.

Conclusions Implementation of the RB was associated with decrease mortality of surgical patients with septic shock. Amongall sepsis bundle elements, the source control was the onlyindependent predictor of survival. The compliance of ManagementBundles had no impact on survival. P343 Standard operating procedure in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock T Schwab, A Schmitz, S Richter, C Bode, H Busch University Hospital, Freiburg, GermanyCritical Care 2009, 13(Suppl 1): P343 (doi: 10.1186/cc7507) Introduction Patients with severe sepsis and septic shock still have a high mortality rate, despite improvements in intensive care therapy.In the present study we assessed the impact of a standard operatingalgorithm adjusted on international treatment recommendations inpatients with severe sepsis and/or septic shock (for example, volumeresuscitation, hemodynamic control, glycemic control, substitution ofselenium and/or hydrocortisone and the use of recombinant humanactivated protein C (rhAPC)) on the outcome.Methods A retrospective analysis of 144 patients admitted to our medical ICU in 2004 and 2006. In 2004, before implementation ofthe standard operating procedure (SOP), 74 patients fulfillingcriteria for diagnosis of severe sepsis and/or septic shock wereanalysed and compared with 70 patients after implementation ofevidence-based SOP in 2006.Results Both groups did not show any difference in initial APACHE II score and clinical baseline characteristics. With imple-mentation of the SOP, use of volume in the first 6 hours (1,506 vs.2,154 ml, P<0.05) and in the first day (4,005 vs. 6,122 ml, P<0.001) significantly increased. Furthermore, treatment with hydro- cortisone, selenium and insulin increased after implementation of theSOP significantly. Catecholamines and rhAPC were unaffected.Mortality in the patient group without SOP was 57%, and in theintervention group with SOP the mortality was 38.5% ( P<0.05). Conclusions Owing to the implementation of a standard algorithm, a significant increase in volume therapy and adjunctive sepsistherapy were realised more frequently compared with patientstreated without the SOP and could be associated with a lowermortality rate in patients. The realisation of an evidence-basedSOP in daily practice in patients with severe sepsis and/or septicshock might be effective, shown in the alteration of treatmentpractice and the reduction of mortality. P344 Epidemiology and outcome of patients with severe sepsis in six Spanish ICUs L Lorente1, M Mart\u00edn2, C D\u00edaz3, L 10.1186/cc7508) Introduction The objective of this study was to describe the epidemiology, consumption of resources and outcome of patientswith severe sepsis.Methods A prospective, observational and multicenter study performed in six Spanish ICUs. Only patients with severe sepsiswere included.Results A total of 122 patients with severe sepsis were included (female 33.1%; mean age 58.01 \u00b1 15.40 years; mean admission ICU 21.10 \u00b1 8.89). The source of theinfection was respiratory abdominal in 19.2% and otherfoci in 24.6%. Sepsis-related Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA)scores at the time of diagnosis of severe sepsis were the following:global 10.21 \u00b1 3.75, respiratory 2.66 \u00b1 neurological 35.4%and renal 55.4%. rate of use of medical resources was asfollows: adrenergic agents 90.8%, mechanical ventilation 86.2%,extrarenal depuration 20% and recombinant activated protein C15.4%. Mean length of stay in the ICU was 16.88 \u00b1 18.98 days.The mortality rate in the ICU was 43.44%. We found that lacticacid serum levels (OR = 1.26, 95% CI = 1.11 to 1.43, P<0.001), SOFA score (OR = 1.24, 95% CI = 1.12 to 1.37, P<0.001) and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) plasma levels (OR = 1.02,95% CI = 1.01 to1.03, P=0.001) at the time of diagnosis were predictors of mortality.Conclusions Severe sepsis is an important cause of mortality and it incurs a considerable use of resources. Lactic acid serum levels,SOFA score and PAI-1 plasma levels at diagnosis were found tobe predictors of mortality. P345 Epidemiology of severe sepsis in India S Chatterjee1, S S (doi: 10.1186/cc7509) Introduction A multicentre, prospective, observational study conducted in four intensive therapy units (ITUs) in India from June2006 to September 2008 to determine the incidence and outcomeof severe sepsis among adult patients.Methods All patients admitted to the ITU were screened daily for SIRS, organ dysfunction and severe sepsis as defined by the ACCPand SCCM. Patients with severe sepsis were further studied.Results A total of 4,183 ITU admissions were studied. SIRS with organ dysfunction was found in 1,286 (30.74%) patients, of which688 (53.50%) were due to severe sepsis. The incidence of severesepsis was 16.45% of all admissions. The mean age of the studypopulation was 56.72 years (SD = 18.20), of which 62.63% weremale. The median APACHE II score was 19 (IQR 18 to 20) withpredominant (90.93%) medical admission. The ITU mortality of alladmissions was 17.70% and that of severe sepsis was 46.30%.The hospital mortality and 28-day mortality of severe sepsis were53.39% and 55.05%, respectively. The standardized mortality ratioof severe sepsis patients was 2.20. The median duration of stay inthe ITU for the severe sepsis cohort who survived was 4 days (IQR4 to 5). The number of episodes where infection was the primaryreason for admission to the ITU was 98.11%. Culture positivitywas found in 44.48%. Lung was the predominant source of sepsis(35.90%). Gram-negative organisms were responsible for 57.86%of cases and Gram-positive for 16.63%. The rest were parasitic,viral and fungal infections.Conclusions Severe sepsis was common in Indian ITUs. The ITU mortality was higher compared with the western literature. Gram-positive infections were less common although the incidence ofparasitic and viral infection was higher than in the West.Available online http://ccforum.com/supplements/13/S1S142P346 Improving identification of severe sepsis by junior doctors: an observational study M Slattery, D Hepburn, R Jagadeeswaran, 10.1186/cc7510) Introduction is a significant cause of morbidity and mor- tality worldwide. Early recognition and treatment are of paramountimportance in reducing mortality; this has been highlighted by theSurviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) [1]. A consensus of opinionexists as to Time Zero being the first instance where severe sepsisis present. We undertook a study of newly qualified doctors in auniversity teaching hospital, to evaluate how effective they were atrecognising severe sepsis; and whether a simple intervention couldimprove their ability to perform this task.Methods The case file of a patient with septic inflammatory response syndrome leading to severe sepsis was identified andanonymised. Time Zero was identified by the investigators basedon the SSC criteria. The case file was distributed to a sample ofjunior doctors over a 2-month period. They were asked to study theretrospective case record and fill in a questionnaire identifyingwhen they felt Time Zero occurred. These data were collected andthen the doctors were given an educational tool about the SSCguidelines and the definition of Time Zero. They were then asked toreappraise the case and reassess the Time Zero point based ontheir new knowledge.Results Thirty junior doctors participated; all had less than 4 months postgraduate experience. Time Zero was correctlyidentified on the first attempt by 17% ( n= 5) of the juniors. Time Zero estimates ranged from -70 to +920 minutes of the actualvalue. After implementation of the teaching tool, 100% of the doctors correctly identified Time Zero according to the SSC criteria.Conclusions These results show that there can be significant discrepancies in the accuracy of prediction of Time Zero, which inturn could have significant implications for the diagnosis and timelyinception of treatment in severe sepsis. A simple intervention suchas an educational tool based on current SSC guidelines canimprove the accuracy and speed of diagnosis, and this may havean effect on morbidity and mortality.Reference1.

P347 Prevalence of ICU infection in South Africa and accuracy of treating physician diagnosis and treatment S Bhagwanjee, J Scribante, F Paruk, G Richards University of the AfricaCritical Care 2009, 13(Suppl 1): P347 (doi: 10.1186/cc7511) Introduction ICU infection is an important cause of morbidity and mortality. Equally, it is important to establish to what extentphysicians are capable of making effective diagnoses andimplement correct treatment for sepsis. A national prevalence ofICU infection study was conducted in South African ICUs toevaluate these two issues.Methods Approval to conduct the study was obtained from all appropriate authorities. A 1-day prevalence of sepsis study wasundertaken on 16 August 2005. A proportional probability samplewas determined from all ICUs in the country. Attending physicianswere asked to indicate their diagnosis and treatment on the day ofthe study. Relevant clinical data were collected for each patient and reviewed by two independent intensivists.Results All units chosen agreed to participate. The 28-day hospital mortality was 58 of 248 patients (23%). The prevalence of eachcategory of the SIRS [1] criteria and associated percentagemortality respectively was nil 59 (8%), SIRS 120 (9%), sepsis 40(28%), severe sepsis 13 (35%) and septic shock 16 (41%). Onehundred and ninety-six patients were deemed to have one of thesepsis diagnoses by the primary physician, an overdiagnosis of51%. Antibiotic prescription and associated mortality percentagerespectively were: appropriate 82 (12%) and inappropriate 100(28%). Antibiotic therapy was changed correctly after microbiologydata in 21 of 88 patients (24%). Duration of therapy was correct in51 of 183 patients (28%).Conclusions The prevalence of sepsis and the associated mortality is similar to that described in other studies [1]. Physicianstend to overdiagnose sepsis. Antibiotic prescribing practices wereincorrect with respect to selection, modification after microbiologydata and duration of treatment. A major deficiency in diagnosticand therapeutic ability among physicians was identified in thisstudy. Appropriate steps must be taken to remedy this deficiency.Reference1. Dombrovskiy VY, et al.: Defining severe community-acquired pneumonia: a significant barrier to improving patient outcomes MM Balp, C Naujoks Novartis Introduction pneumonia an exaggerated inflammatory and coagulation response to infection.sCAP has high rates of mortality and necessitates modifiedtreatment to that for mild/moderate community-acquired pneu-monia (CAP). Despite the grave nature of this condition it is poorlycharacterised. A systematic review was performed to gaugecurrent data and identify unmet needs associated with sCAP.Methods MEDLINE was searched for English-language papers concerning sCAP published after 1998.Results There are a number of published indices for diagnosing sCAP but these are difficult to use in the clinical setting. In theliterature, sCAP is defined as CAP requiring admittance to an ICUor as CAP that results in death. Current International StatisticalClassification of Disease and diagnosis-related group codes donot specify whether pneumonia is community acquired or hospitalacquired or indicate the severity of the infection. Estimates of theprevalence of sCAP in patients with CAP range from 6.6 to 16.0%[1,2]. Mortality rates for patients with sCAP range from 10 to 55%[3,4]. The discrepancy in these rates emphasises the variation inhospital practices due to the lack of an objective definition ofsCAP. The absence of a clear definition for sCAP could result ininappropriate treatment of this life-threatening condition, increasingmortality rates. There are scant data concerning the costs oftreating sCAP; increased expenditure for patients with sCAPversus those with CAP results from ICU treatment, increasedlength of hospital stay, mechanical ventilation, vasopressor use andrehabilitation costs. It is expected that the clinical and cost benefitsof new therapies will be more easily recognised if sCAP isconsistently defined. Defining sCAP appropriately requires afocused international initiative and collaboration between cliniciansand payers.Conclusions There is a major unmet need for a meaningful definition of sCAP. Poor characterisation of sCAP has resulted inCritical Care March 2009 Vol 13 Suppl 1 29th International Symposium on Intensive Care and Emergency MedicineS143variable reports of its prevalence and may result in inappropriate treatment leading to increased mortality in this patient population.The results of this systematic review form the basis for developinga new treatment pathway to improve outcomes for patients withsCAP.References1.

P349 Outcome of severe sepsis in the ICU is independent of haemoglobin levels J Wood, D Pandit William Harvey Hospital, Ashford, UKCritical Care 2009, 13(Suppl 1): P349 (doi: 10.1186/cc7513) Introduction In this observational cohort study we attempted to elucidate a haemoglobin (Hb) target that favours the mortalityoutcome in severe sepsis patients. The optimum level of Hb toinfluence outcome in severe sepsis is yet to be determined.Although the analysis of severe sepsis patients in the Canadiantransfusion requirement in critical care study [1] did not find anymortality benefit with a Hb level of 10 g/dl or above, the early goal-directed therapy trial [2] showed significant mortality benefit byachieving haematocrit 30%, equivalent to a Hb value of 10 g/dl, during the early treatment period. This pilot study was thereforeundertaken to look for any relationship between Hb levels andmortality in severe sepsis patients admitted to the ICU.Methods All patients 16 years or older with severe sepsis or septic shock who stayed longer than 24 hours between July 2006 andJune 2007 were retrospectively included in the study. Patientdemographics, Hb levels measured by the blood gas analyserduring their period of severe sepsis and outcome data werecollected. Binary logistic regression analysis was performed withICU survival and 28-day survival as the dependent variables.Results Of the 62 patients enrolled in the study, the average age was 66.8 years (16 to 87 years), with mean admission APACHE IIscore and Simplified Acute Physiology Score II being 18 (8 to 30)and 58 (17 to 78), respectively. Their ICU and 28-day mortalityrates were 35.5% and 41.9%, respectively. On analysis nosignificant relationship was found between average Hb, Hbvariation, minimum Hb, maximum Hb, and number of unitstransfused with ICU or 28-day survival. In addition, no significantrelationship was found between Hb falling below thresholds of 7,8, 9, or 10 g/dl, or variation from an Hb of 7, 8, 9, 10 g/dl duringsevere sepsis and the ICU survival or 28-day survival.Conclusions While a haematocrit of 30% represents a physiological optimum between viscosity and oxygen carriage, theequivalent Hb from this pilot study shows no advantage in theoutcome of severe sepsis. This study suggests that any effect Hblevels may have on the outcome from severe sepsis is likely to besmall.References 1.

The HSwas defined as hyperthermia (>38\u00baC), <1,600 dynes x s/cm5x m2. The study included demographic polymorphisms (A/G) of TNF postoperative course. Weused the Pearson chi-square test or Fischer exact test, and theStudent t test for univariate analysis, with forward stepwise logistic regression for multivariate adjustment.Results Eighty patients were studied, of whom 22 (27.5%) developed HS. The presence of allele G of TNF +250 poly- morphism was associated increased HS(68% vs. 37%; P= 0.011). In the multivariate analysis, a longer duration of ECC, and the presence of the G allele, wereassociated with the development of HS.Conclusions The G allele of TNF +250 polymorphism, and pro- longed extracorporeal circuit times, may favour the development ofa hyperdynamic state after heart surgery with ECC. and the PAI-1 plasma levels in the outcome of patients with severe sepsis L Lorente1, M Mart\u00edn2, L Labarta3, C 1): P352 (doi: 10.1186/cc7516) Introduction The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of the 4G/5G plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) genepolymorphism on the plasma outcome in criticallyill patients with severe sepsis.Available online http://ccforum.com/supplements/13/S1S144Methods A prospective, observational and multicenter study carried out in six Spanish ICUs. Only patients with severe sepsis wereincluded. Epidemiological data, severity scores, site of infection andoutcome of sepsis were recorded. Measurement of PAI-1 plasmalevels (at diagnosis, 72 hours and 7 days of diagnosis of severesepsis) and the DNA genotyping of the PAI-1 were carried out.Results A total of 122 patients with severe sepsis were included. Nonsurvivor patients ( n= 53) exhibited higher PAI-1 plasma concentrations than the survivor patients ( n= 69) at the time of diagnosis of (60.17 \u00b1 30.34 15.85; P= 0.07). PAI-1 plasma levels at diagnosis were found a predictor of mortality (OR = 1.02, 95% CI = 1.01 to 1.03, P = 0.001). We did not find significant differences between 4G/5G PAI-1 plasma levels at the time of diagnosis are markers of an unfavourable prognosis in patients with severesepsis. We have not, however, found any correlation between the4G/5G PAI-1 gene polymorphism, plasma levels of PAI-1 ormortality of patients with severe sepsis. P353 Role of monocyte apoptosis for the final outcome of the septic host with peritonitis A Kotsaki1, I Tzepi1, P Carrer1, K Hospital, 2009, 13(Suppl 1): 10.1186/cc7517) Introduction Former studies have shown that monocyte apoptosis is crucial for the final outcome of sepsis in the field of acutepyelonephritis [1]. The significance of apoptosis in acute intra-abdominal infection was studied.Methods Acute peritonitis was induced after cecal ligation and puncture in 17 male New Zealand rabbits. Four sham-operatedrabbits were also studied. Peripheral blood mononuclear cellswere isolated after Ficol gradient centrifugation; monocytes werefurther plastic adherence. Apoptosis of monocyteswas estimated after staining positive for annexin V negative forpropidium iodine by flow cytometric analysis.Results Monocyte apoptosis is presented in Table 1. A rate of apoptosis greater than 40% was found in six animals after24 hours; it was lower than 40% for 11 animals. The mediansurvival of the former was 15.2 days and of the latter 4.2 days (log-rank: 5.49, P= 0.019). Conclusions Sepsis arising in the field of peritonitis is accompanied by inhibition of apoptosis of monocytes. The rate ofapoptosis 24 hours after sepsis induction is detrimental for thesurvival of the septic host.Reference Genomic variations within matrix metalloproteinase-9 and severe sepsis Q Chen, Y Jin, X Fang First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, ChinaCritical Care 2009, 13(Suppl 1): P354 (doi: 10.1186/cc7518) Introduction Sepsis is a multiple-gene disease resulting from the interaction of environmental and genetic components. Matrix metallo-proteinase-9 (MMP-9) has been demonstrated to play an importantrole in organ dysfunction and outcome of sepsis [1-3]. However,genetic predisposition of MMP-9 to sepsis remained unknown.Methods Seven common SNPs within the regions (rs17576, rs9509,rs3918240, rs3918241 and rs3918242) were investigated in 192patients with severe sepsis and 262 healthy controls. Meanwhile,the plasma levels of MMP-9 were measured via ELISA.Results The genotype distributions and allelic frequencies of the above seven SNPs were not significantly different between patientswith severe sepsis and controls, as well as between surviving andnonsurviving patients with severe sepsis (all P>0.05). Haplotype GGCTTTC, GACTTAT and common haplotypes. The distribution of thehaplotypes was also comparable among the defined groups. Themedian plasma levels of MMP-9 was 37.66 ng/ml in 32 patientswithin the first 24 hours following the diagnosis of severe sepsis,and 30.15 ng/ml in 19 healthy controls. Compared with those insurviving patients with severe sepsis (median 37.66 ng/ml, n= 16) and healthy controls, the concentrations of MMP-9 appeared anincreasing trend in nonsurviving patients with severe sepsis (median36.06 ng/ml, n= 16). Conclusions The present findings suggest that common poly- morphisms within the function regions of MMP-9 gene may notplay a major role in the predisposition to severe sepsis in theChinese Han cohort. The plasma levels of MMP-9 may associatewith the outcome of severe sepsis. Further studies in largesamples need to be guaranteed.References1.

The study objective was to investigate whether IL-10 promoter polymorphism -1082 G/A is associated with adverse outcome in severe sepsis and septic shock patients. Methods The study was conducted in the mixed medical-surgical adult ICU of P. Stradin Clinical University Hospital in Riga in 2007 and 2008. A total of 103 critically ill patients who met the proposed severe sepsis and septic shock criteria were included. The IL-10 -1082 polymorphism was genotyped by sequencing. All patients were followed up throughout their stay in the ICU to clinical outcome. The frequency distributions of the genotypes in the subgroups were compared using the Pearson chi-square test. P<0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance. Results Of the 103 patients observed, 44 (43%) had an adverse outcome in the ICU. In the survival group 11 (19%) had G/G at position -1082 of the IL-10 gene, heterozygous 23 five G/G, had nine (21%) had the A/A genotype. The polymorphism nonsurvival differed significantly ( P= 0.034, 2= 6.8). The relative risk for adverse outcome in IL-10 -1082 alternative G allele carriers (G/G and G/A genotypes) was 1.6 (95% CI = 0.91 to 2.83). Conclusions We found association of the IL-10 promoter polymorphism -1082 G/A with clinical outcome in severe sepsis and septic shock patients; alternative -1082 G allele carriage seems to be associated with greater risk for adverse outcome in the studied patient population.

P356 Activated protein C restores kidney function in endotoxin- induced acute renal failure in the rat E Almac1, T Johannes2, E Center, Rotterdam, the Netherlands; 4Lariboisi\u00e8re Hospital, University of Paris, France Critical Care 2009, 13(Suppl 1): P356 (doi: 10.1186/cc7520) Introduction Activated protein C (APC) has been shown to have beneficial effects on the inflammatory process and coagulation during sepsis. Inflammation and coagulopathy impair the micro- vasculature and therefore disturb oxygen transport to the tissue. The hypothesis of our study was that APC treatment improves renal microvascular oxygenation and kidney function in endotoxin- induced acute renal failure in the rat. Methods In 18 anesthetized and ventilated (FiO20.4) male Wistar rats, the arterial blood pressure and renal blood flow were recorded. The renal microvascular PO2was continuously measured by phosphorescence lifetime technique. All animals received a lipopolysaccharide (LPS) bolus (10 mg/kg) to induce endotoxemic shock. All rats received fluid resuscitation (hydroxyethyl starch 130 kDa) 1 hour after LPS application. In one group of animals, APC (drotrecogin alpha, Xigris\u00ae; Lilly) was continuously infused in a concentration of 10 g/kg/hour. Another group received a continuous infusion of 100 g/kg/hour APC.Results Data are presented in Figure 1. Conclusions APC at a concentration of 100 g/kg/hour signifi- cantly restored kidney function compared with standard fluid resuscitation during endotoxemia. This application best improved the mean arterial pressure. APC had no beneficial effects, however, on the average renal microvascular PO2. P357 Angiopoietin-2 is a mediator involved in the of hypotension following endotoxin shock PD Greece; 2University of Thessaloniki Medical School, (doi: produced by endothelial cells [1]. It is in doubt whether its production in the intubated septic host is due to an effect of anesthetic medication or to the sepsis process. The present study attempted to provide an answer. Methods In 10 mechanically ventilated pigs, anesthesia was maintained by sevoflurane inhalation. Then shock was induced by the intravenous administration of 25 mg/kg lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of Escherichia coli 111: B4 in eight pigs; two were controls. Blood was collected by a Swan-Ganz catheter and by a peripheral vein. Ang-2 was estimated by an enzyme immunoassay. Results The median Ang-2 of the peripheral circulation among controls and pigs at shock was at baseline 1,403.2 and 2,390.6 pg/ml ( pg/ml ( P= NS). Respective values of the lung and 1,738.7 ( P= NS). Conclusions Ang-2 is a mediator involved in the advent of shock not influenced by the administration of sevoflurane. Reference 1.

Its expression is induced by pro-atherogenic stimuli as well as by inflammatory cytokines. LOX-1 acts also as an adhesion molecule involved in leukocyte recruitment. The systemic leukocyte activation in sepsis represents a crucial factor in the impairment of the microcirculation of different tissues, causing multiple organ failure and death. The aim of our experimental study was therefore to evaluate the effects of LOX-1 inhibition on the endotoxin-induced leukocyte adherence within the using intravital microscopy. Methods Group 1 ( n= 10 Lewis rats) remained untreated and served as the control group. In Group 2 ( n= 10) endotoxemia was induced by intravenous administration of 2 mg/kg lipopolysaccha- ride (LPS). In Group 3 ( n= 10) endotoxemic animals were treated with 10 mg/kg anti-Lox-1-IgG. Endotoxemic animals of Group 4 (n= 10) were treated with an unspecific IgG. Following 2 hours of endotoxin challenge or placebo administration, intestinal micro- circulation was evaluated using intravital microscopy. LOX-1 expression was quantified by western blot and cription PCR. Results LOX-1 inhibition reduced significantly the leukocyte in the submucosal venules of the intestinal wall (P<0.05). Functional capillary density of the intestinal muscular layers as well as in the mucosa increased following administration of the LOX-1-antibody in comparison with untreated LPS animals (P<0.05). At the mRNA level, LOX-1 expression was significantly increased in the untreated LPS group ( P<0.05) whereas animals with LOX-1-antibody administration showed a significant reduction of the expression ( P<0.05). Conclusions LOX-1-antibody administration in experimental endotoxaemia significantly reduced leukocyte adherence and increased microvascular perfusion within the intestinal micro- The inhibition of the lectin-like oxidized low-density lipoprotein receptor-1 may represent an attractive target for the modulation of endotoxin-induced impairment of the micro- circulation in sepsis.

This vagal anti-inflammatory pathway is mediated by the nicotinergic a7nACh receptor that can be selectively stimulated by GTS-21. Up to now, the anti-inflammatory effects of oral administration of GTS-21 in humans in vivo have not been investigated. The aim of this study was to investigate the anti- inflammatory effects of oral administration of GTS-21 on the inflammatory response in the human endotoxemia model. Methods We performed a double-blind placebo-controlled randomized study in 12 healthy, nonsmoking male volunteers (18 to 28 years) during experimental endotoxemia. Subjects received 150 mg GTS-21 or placebo orally three times daily 3 days before lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injection and on the day of the experi- ment, the last dose 1 hour before LPS administration ( t= -1). One hour after the last dose of GTS-21 or placebo, LPS derived from Escherichia coli O:113 was injected (2 ng/kg intravenously). Results The main study endpoint was the concentration of circulating cytokines after LPS in the absence and presence of GTS-21. The effects of GTS-21 on TNF and IL-10 release are shown in Figures 1 and 2. There was a trend towards a decrease in TNF levels and an increase in IL-10 levels after GTS-21 administration. A similar trend was observed in levels of other proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines.Critical Care March 2009 Vol 13 Suppl 1 29th International Symposium on Intensive Care and Emergency Medicine Figure 1 (abstract P359) Figure 2 (abstract P359) S147Conclusions endotoxemia in healthy human volunteers,resulting in a shift towards a more anti-inflammatory pattern.

Between the two patient groups,no differences were found concerning the intensity of the inflam-matory response.Conclusions The basic concentration of IL-6 was higher in ICU patients. After ex vivo challenge with LTA and mannan, no differences in the intensity of the inflammatory response weredetected between the two groups. LTA is a much more potentimmunostimulator than mannan in both ICU and HD patients. P361 Asymmetric and symmetric dimethylarginines: metabolism and role in severe sepsis M Umbrello, F Colombo Pavini, L Bolgiaghi, markers of protein break-down; both compete with arginine for cellular transport and areexcreted in urine. In addition, ADMA is a nonselective inhibitor ofNO synthase, and by dimethylarginine-dimethylaminohydrolase a specific hydrolase whoseactivity in stress is controversial [1]. While the ADMA increase isassociated with adverse events in many critical conditions, little attention has been focused on the role of SDMA [2].Methods In three Italian university ICUs we measured plasma ADMA, SDMA, their ratio (a marker of C-reactive protein (CRP) level at days 1, 3, 6, 9, 12 and at discharge in 72consecutive patients normal. ADMA wasrelated to total Sequential Organ Assessment and arginine,inversely related to IL-6 and CRP; SDMA was related to SimplifiedAcute Physiology Score II score, daily, worst-day, total SequentialOrgan Failure Assessment score, blood urea, creatinine, andarginine. The ADMA/SDMA ratio was inversely related to discharged creatinine, IL-6 and ADMA increased, SDMA remained stable, and theADMA/SDMA ratio increased. In 14 patients who died in the ICU,creatinine, IL-6, TNF , CRP, and ADMA did not significantly increased, and ADMA/SDMA ratio variation was notsignificant. In both groups the last ICU day confirms data trends.SDMA but not ADMA was associated with ICU mortality.Conclusions In severe sepsis SDMA is a more robust predictor of organ failure/mortality than ADMA. Stress reaction seems toactivate ADMA catabolism, while in survivors, when inflammationsubsides, the catabolism seems to be reduced.References1.

We have previously demonstrated that IFN mRNA gene expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) isdownregulated in patients with sepsis compared with healthycontrols [2]. Here we investigated IFN gene expression in cultured PBMC from healthy controls and patients with severesepsis and examined whether exogenous IL-2 can influence IFN mRNA expression.Methods PBMC were isolated from five healthy controls and five patients with severe sepsis and were cultured in 24-well plates.Available online http://ccforum.com/supplements/13/S1 Table 1 (abstract P360) Cytokine concentrations before and after LTA and mannan challenge ICU IL-6 ICU = 0.3687S148Cells were incubated in medium alone or stimulated with either 1g/ml lipopolysaccharide (LPS) for 24 hours (activate monocytes and B cells), 3 g/ml anti-CD3 (mAb) for 4 hours (activate T cells), or 10 ng/ml phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) + 1 M ionomycin for 4 hours (activate all cells). Each experiment was performed in the absence and presence of 50 U recombinant IL-2 (rIL-2). Total RNA was isolated and reverse transcribed. IFN mRNA gene expression was quantified with quantitative RT-PCR. Results were analysed with ANOVA and the ttest where appropriate. Results IFNmRNA production is lower in PBMC of patients with sepsis compared with healthy controls ( P = 0.03) but similar when measured in the presence of rIL-2. With T-cell stimulation, IFN mRNA was greater in PBMC from septic patients compared with controls ( P = 0.02) but similar in the presence of rIL-2. With LPS stimulation of monocytes and B cells, IFN mRNA was lower in PBMC from septic patients compared with controls ( P = 0.02), but similar in the presence of rIL-2. With PMA stimulation, IFN mRNA was similar in PBMC from septic patients and controls in the presence and absence of rIL-2. Conclusions IFNmRNA production is reduced in PBMC in sepsis but can be stimulated ex vivo to produce normal IFN levels. In the absence of rIL-2, IFN mRNA production is inducible in T cells but not in monocytes and B cells. IL-2 modulation of IFN mRNA production appears to be stimulus dependent, and may contribute to the host defence mechanism. References 1. Burkett P, et al.: Diverse functions of 2.

Sechenov Medical Academy, Care 2009, 13(Suppl 1): P363 (doi: 10.1186/cc7527) Introduction Our purpose was to assess the effects of super- physiologic dosages of human purified C1-esterase inhibitor infusion (C1INH) on complement-dependent pathways of systemic inflammatory response in patients with sepsis.Methods In the terms of an open-label prospective control study, human purified C1INH (Bicizar; BioGenius LLC, Russia) was administered at total dosage of 12,000 U to 20 sepsis patients. Patients ( n= 22) who did not receive C1INH infusion were enrolled as controls. C3 and C4 complement subunits, IL-6, C- reactive protein and procalcitonin results were analyzed in quartiles according to C1INH baseline activity. Results C1INH activity was different in quartiles at entry in both groups ( P <0.03). C1INH infusion resulted in elevation of C1INH activity in the treatment arm (Figure 1). The most significant difference was observed between the upper quartiles of the groups ( P <0.01). The degree of C1INH activity shift had a nega- tive association with <0.05) levels displayed a more rapid and pronounced rise after C1INH infusion in patients with higher baseline C1INH activity. The C-reactive protein concentration dropped significantly in patients who received C1INH (130 mg/l (28 to 293)) already on the third day of the study in comparison with the control (185 mg/l (72 to 343); P = 0.022). The same trend characterized the IL-6 level. Patients with elevated procalcitonin values at the onset of sepsis had a more significant C1INH increase ( r= 0.635, P <0.05). Conclusions Downregulation of complement activity with C1INH might help to contain severe systemic inflammation. Presumably, the response to C1INH infusion was related to its baseline activity.

The present study was designed to assess the effects of MPs from septic origin on systemic hemodynamics as well as on the inflammatory, oxidative and nitrosative stresses. Methods We designed a prospective, randomized, controlled experimental study with repeated measurements. Forty healthy rats were randomly allocated to three groups: 10 animals inoculated with MPs isolated from control rats (cMPs), 15 animals inoculatedCritical Care March 2009 Vol 13 Suppl 1 29th International Symposium on Intensive Care and Emergency Medicine Figure 1 (abstract P363) C1INH activity in the Bicizar (q) and control groups (c): analysis in quartiles. S149with MPs isolated from sham rats (shMPs) and 15 animals inoculated with MPs isolated from rats with peritonitis (sMPs). Ratswere anesthetized, mechanically ventilated and were infused withthe same amount of cMPs or shMPs or sMPs. We measured theheart rate, mean arterial pressure, carotid artery blood flow andportal vein blood flow. Hemodynamic parameters were recordedduring 7 hours, and then animals were sacrificed. The aorta andheart were harvested for further in vitro tissue analyses. Results (1) The cellular origin (phenotype) but not the circulating concentration of MPs was different in septic rats, characterized bya significant increase in leukocyte-derived MPs. (2) sMPs but notcMPs or shMPs decreased the mean arterial pressure without anyeffect on carotid artery and portal vein blood flows. (3) Ratsinoculated with sMPs exhibited an increase in superoxide ionproduction and NF- B activity, overexpression of inducible NO synthase with subsequent NO overproduction and decrease inendothelial NO synthase activation.Conclusions Rats with sepsis induced by peritonitis exhibited a specific phenotype of MPs. Inoculation of sMPs in healthy ratsreproduced with oxidative and nitrosative stresses.References1.

These effects were accompanied byreduction in myocardial IL-1 levels and reduction in neutrophilinfiltration [3]. The cardiac protection of H 2S was confirmed in a porcine model of myocardial ischemia [4] and in a canine model ofcardiopulmonary bypass surgery. IK-1001 was also protective inmurine and ovine models of acute respiratory distress syndrome,where improvement in survival and pulmonary function wasaccompanied by a reduction in oxidant stress and suppression ofthe production of IL-6 and inhibition of the expression of oxide synthase [5]. In models of thoracoabdominal aneurysmsurgery, reperfusion was accompanied with significant increases inthe production of IL-1 and IL-6, which were reduced by IK-1001.IK-1001 also improved renal function, provided hemodynamicstabilization and attenuated oxidative DNA damage [6].Conclusions H 2S thus exerts organ-protective and anti-inflam- matory effects in various animal models of critical illness. Themechanisms may involve metabolic effects leading to the inductionof hypothermia, antioxidant mechanisms, modulation geneexpression, inhibition of inflam-matory cell activation.References1.

We tested the hypothesis thatdimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO), a free radical scavenger, has aprotective role in a renal ischemia-reperfusion animal model [1].Methods Renal ischemia was induced to 45 male, New Zealand rabbits. The subjects were divided into three groups based onischemia duration: 30, 60 or 90 minutes. Each group was dividedinto three subgroups: (a) DMSO previous to ischemia, (b) DMSOafter ischemia, (c) control group. All subjects were given 6 hours ofreperfusion. Three blood samples were taken at baseline, ischemicand reperfusion phases. Each sample was tested for serumcreatinine, blood ureic nitrogen and urea. After reperfusion,bilateral nephrectomy was performed on each subject beforeeuthanasia. A pathological analysis evaluated tubular and base-ment membrane changes. The level of injury was scaled in threestages: mild, moderate and severe.Results The histological analysis showed severe damage in 33% of the control group, compared with 0% in both treatment groups(chi-square P= 0.00) (Table 1).

Creatinine values were analyzed over a proportion estimate, showing that 26% of subjectsin the control group had an improvement comparing the ischemicphase versus the reperfusion phase. Treatment groups showedthat 46% and 60% of the subjects improved their creatinine valueswhen DMSO was administered pre ischemia and post ischemia,respectively.Conclusions The animal model showed an increasing trend of all blood chemistry parameters evaluated in the control group. DMSOapplied as prophylaxis or treatment post ischemia demonstratesdiminished renal function deterioration. Histological analysis revealedthe absence of lesions when DMSO is administered.Reference1.

P367 Beneficial effects of the heme oxygenase-1/carbon monoxide system Takeyama, S Takaki, Y Kajita, Yabuki, H Noguchi, Y Miki, Y Inoue, T Nakagawa, H Care 2009, 13(Suppl 1): P367 (doi: 10.1186/cc7531) Introduction It has been reported that the blood level of carboxyhemoglobin (CO-Hb) is increased in critically ill patientssuch as those with sepsis or multiple trauma [1,2]. Becausecarbon monoxide (CO) is one of the metabolites of hemecatabolism, it has been suggested that there may be increasedbreakdown of heme in these patients. Heme oxygenase (HO) is theenzyme involved in the rate-limiting step for catabolism of heme-containing proteins. It was recently reported that HO-1 acts as apotent anti-inflammatory agent and antioxidant through its HO-1 may therefore be an inducible defense against cellularstress that occurs during the inflammatory process [1,4]. Againstthis background, we decided to evaluate the relation among theblood level of CO, HO-1 expression by monocytes, oxidativestress, and the outcome of sepsis.Methods Thirty patients who fulfilled the criteria for severe sepsis or septic shock and 17 other patients without sepsis during theirstay in the ICU were studied. HO-1 expression by monocytes,arterial CO, oxidative stress, and cytokines were measured.Results Arterial blood levels of CO, cytokines, as well as monocyte HO-1 expression were higher in septic shock patients than innonseptic patients. Increased HO-1 expression was significantlycorrelated with the arterial CO concentration and oxidative stress.There was a positive correlation between survival and higher HO-1expression or CO level.Conclusions We found that the increase of endogenous CO production in sepsis mainly reflects increased heme turnoversecondary to upregulation of HO-1, which is partially in responseto systemic oxidative stress. A strong correlation between theblood CO level and survival supports the beneficial effect of HO-1upregulation and increased CO production in patients with sepsis.References1.

P368 Assessment of IL-18 values in septic acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome patients T Kikkawa, Y Suzuki, H Makabe, S Shibata, G Takahashi, N Matsumoto, N Sato, 10.1186/cc7532) Introduction IL-18 is said to be involved in organ injury. We investigated the IL-18 values of septic acute lung injury (ALI) andacute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) patients.Methods The subjects were 38 patients during the 3-year period from 2004 to 2007 from whom it was possible to collect a bloodspecimen within approximately 6 hours of the onset of septic ALI orARDS. Their mean age was 67 years, and their mean APACHE IIscore was 29. Their Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scorewas 13, and their mean PaO 2/FiO2ratio was 170. The PaO2/FiO2 ratio was 246 in the ALI group and 135 in the ARDS group. Therewere four cases (10.5%) in the 28-day mortality group, and sixcases (15.8%) in the 90-day mortality group.Results The value of IL-18 in the dead group was significantly higher than in the surviving group (1,649 in the ARDS group was also significantly higher than in the ALI group (2,467 \u00b1 1,880 pg/ml vs.1,314 \u00b1 These results suggested that IL-18 may play a major role in progression of ARDS in respiratory disorder as multipleorgan failure.

We investigated the opening of the mPTPin septic hearts by measuring cytochrome C release into thecytosol.Methods Sepsis was induced in rats by 7.5 mg/kg lipopoly- saccharide injection intraperitoneally. After 4 hours, hearts wereexcised and mounted in a Langendorff setup to study myocardialcontractility ex vivo . Subsequently, hearts were frozen and 5 m cryostat sections were made. Sections were stained for cytochromeC using immunohistochemistry. Healthy rats served as controls.Results Septic animals showed a decreased contractility (P<0.005) and lower developed pressure ( P<0.001) when compared with healthy controls. Immunohistochemistry revealed norelease of cytochrome C in healthy or septic hearts.Conclusions Cytochrome C is not released during sepsis-induced myocardial depression. These results indicate that the mito-chondrial permeability pore may not be involved in thedevelopment of myocardial dysfunction during sepsis.Critical Care March 2009 Vol 13 Suppl 1 29th International Symposium on Intensive Care and Emergency MedicineS151P370 Strain-specific and pathogen-specific physiologic and genomic differences in Ackland1, R C Hou3, A Patterson2 2Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA; 3Washington University School of Medicine, St Louis, MO, USA Critical Care 2009, 13(Suppl 1): P370 (doi: 10.1186/cc7534) demon- strating physiologic differences with pathologic insults is a novel approach to elucidate potential mechanisms.

We aimed to investigate the pathophysiology of cardiac dys- function in sepsis by integrating echocardiographic with biochemical and inflammatory markers. Methods Over 14 months, 127 consecutive, septic/systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) patients in our ICU were collected. All patients underwent transthoracic echocardiography with measurements of systolic and diastolic function, and blood samples were collected and serum separated for measurements of biomarkers. All clinical parameters were collected from the ICU charts during the days of echocardiography studies and blood sampling. Outcome measures were ICU, inhospital survival and survival up to 2 years. Patients with segmental wall motion abnormality - indicating myocardial infarction or regional ischemia and/or significant mitral or aortic disease - were excluded from the analyses. Results Out of 86 patients without regional myocardial dysfunction and/or significant valvular disease, 36 (42%) died during follow-up, almost all of them within the first 6 months. Thirty-one (36%) patients had positive blood cultures and they were more tachycardic and hypotensive and had shorter E-wave deceleration time (negative culture) patients ( P= 0.024). The echocardiographic measurements most predictive of mortality by Cox survival analysis were E-wave/Em ratio (Exp( ) = 1.12, P= 0.006) and pressure gradient over the tricuspid valve best higher E-wave/Em ratio, and lower Em and Sm waves and with the cytokines TNF and ventricular end- systolic volume or left ventricular ejection fraction did not predict survival and did not correlate with troponin or NT-proBNP elevation. Conclusions After exclusion of all patients with coronary artery disease and/or significant valvular dysfunction, there is still a significant incidence of troponin and NT-proBNP elevation in septic/SIRS patients. Echocardiographic features most signifi- cantly associated with troponin and NT-proBNP elevation were measures of diastolic dysfunction (high E-wave/Em ratio, low Sm and Em). Measures of systolic dysfunction did not correlate with troponin or NT-proBNP elevation.Available online http://ccforum.com/supplements/13/S1 Figure 1 (abstract P370) relative volume units.

As threonine (THR) can also induce cell-swelling, the aim of this studywas to investigate the potential for THR to induce cellularprotection in intestinal epithelial-18 cells and to elucidate themechanism by which it may work.Methods Cells were treated for 15 minutes with increasing doses of THR up to 20 mM, with/without subsequent heat stress (HS)injury. Cell survival was evaluated via MTS assay 24 hoursfollowing lethal HS (44\u00b0C x 50 min). All HS groups werenormalized to their non-HS controls. Western blot analysis wasused to determine active caspase-3 activity (an indicator ofapoptosis), and heat shock protein 25 (HSP25) expression/cellularlocalization in cells subjected to non-lethal HS (43\u00b0C x 45 min).Enhanced nuclear translocation of HSP25 has been linked todecreased apoptosis. to visualize cell cytoplasmic HSP25 has been shown toenhance actin stabilization during cellular stress.Results THR increased cell survival in a dose-dependent manner (P = 0.008 vs. HS controls (CT)), n= 3. A control amino acid cocktail (20 mM valine, alanine and phenylalanine) failed to provideprotection from lethal heat stress. Active caspase-3 activity washighest in HS cells and decreased with THR P= vs. andincreased manner with THR ( P = 0.0006 vs. CT). HS caused nuclear translocation of HSP25, and this effectwas increased even further with THR treatment ( P <0.05 vs. HS CT). Microscopy showed preserved cell size and structuralintegrity of the actin cytoskeleton in HS cells treated with THR.Cell size decreased during HS by 40 \u00b1 5% ( P = 0.003 vs. non-HS controls). These were completely attenuated with THRtreatment ( P = 0.00001 vs. HS CT). Conclusions THR protected cells from lethal HS by decreasing apoptosis. THR can induce HSP25 in CT cells, and enhancenuclear translocation in HS cells. THR treatment preserved thestructural integrity of the actin cytoskeleton and prevented cellularcrenation during HS. It is possible that THR's mechanism ofcellular protection involves cytoskeletal stabilization and pro-brain natriuretic peptide enable dynamic risk stratification in critically patients B Meyer1, M H\u00fclsmann1, P Wexberg1, M Nikfardjam1, 1Medical University of Vienna, Austria; 2University of Economics and Vienna, AustriaCritical 13(Suppl 1): P373 (doi: 10.1186/cc7537) Introduction Risk stratification is a major problem in the care of critically ill patients. To date, there is no widespread acceptance ofany prognostic marker for ongoing risk stratification. In the presentstudy we aim to determine whether N-terminal pro-brain natriureticpeptide (NT-pro-BNP) serves as a marker of dynamic risk stratification.Methods This prospective observational study was performed in the ICU of the Department of Cardiology/Medical University ofVienna between August 2004 and June 2007. Adult patients witha length of ICU stay 48 hours were included. In addition to routine clinical and laboratory assessment, blood samples for deter-mination of NT-pro-BNP were obtained in all patients on admission(NT-pro-BNP-0h) and after 48 hours (NT-pro-BNP-48h). NT-pro-BNP plasma levels were assessed by use of commercially availablekits.Results Out of 286 patients included (196 male (68.5%), age 64 \u00b1 14 years), there were 226 ICU survivors (79%). ICU survivorshad significantly lower NT-pro-BNP-0h as well There was no statistically significant change in NT-pro-BNP levels in ICU survivors compared with ICU more ICU survivors had a decrease in NT-pro-BNP within 48 hours (37% vs. 33%, P <0.0001). In Cox regression andincrease/decrease of NT-pro-BNP were independent predictors ofICU with NT-pro-BNP-48h being the parameter (NT-pro-BNP-0h Wald <0.001; increase/decrease Wald 4.992, P= 0.025, respectively). The area under the receiver opera- ting characteristic curve with respect to prediction of Conclusions NT-pro-BNP reflects not only the severity of the disease on ICU admission, but - more importantly - the plasticityof NT-pro-BNP monitors the severity of the disease during the ICUstay. P374 CT-pro-endothelin-1 and prognosis in critically ill patients with respiratory failure B Meyer1, P Wexberg1, M Nikfardjam1, G Heinz1, Introduction Endothelin-1 is known to be elevated in patients with various pulmonary and nonpulmonary diagnoses. CT-pro-endo-thelin-1 (CT-pro-ET-1) is a stable precursor molecule of endothelin-1. In the present study we tested whether CT-pro-ET-1 is elevatedin critically ill patients admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure.Moreover, we tested whether an elevation of CT-pro-ET-1 is apredictor of an adverse outcome.Methods In this prospective observational study we included 78 patients with documented respiratory failure on ICU admission and266 patients with various other diagnoses and without respiratoryfailure. Blood samples for determination of CT-pro-ET-1 wereobtained in all patients on ICU admission. CT-pro-ET-1 wasdetermined by use of a new sandwich immunoassay.Results Respiratory failure was attributed to a primary pulmonary cause in 66 patients: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease(n= 15), pulmonary hypertension ( n= 7), pneumonia ( n= n= various/mixed causesCritical Care March 2009 Vol 13 Suppl 1 29th International Symposium on Intensive Care and Emergency MedicineS153(n= 6). A total of 12 patients had respiratory failure because of primary cardiogenic edema. Patients presenting with primarypulmonary failure on ICU admission had significantly higherCT-pro-ET-1 levels compared with patients with diagnosis ofcardiogenic pulmonary edema and patients without respiratoryfailure (193 \u00b1 117 vs. 160 \u00b1 67 vs. 148 \u00b1 94 pmol/l, P = 0.007). In patients with primary pulmonary failure and in patients withcardiogenic edema, there was no statistically significant differencein CT-pro-ET-1 levels between ICU survivors and ICU nonsurvivors(195 \u00b1 155 vs. 191 \u00b1 127 pmol/l, P = 0.908 and 160 \u00b1 75 vs. 164 \u00b1 5 pmol/l, P = 0.940). In contrast, in the mixed cohort of critically ill patients without respiratory failure, CT-pro-ET-1 levelswere statistically significantly lower in ICU survivors compared withICU nonsurvivors (140 \u00b1 93 vs. 179 \u00b1 95 pmol/l, P = 0.007). Conclusions CT-pro-ET-1 plasma levels are increased in patients admitted to the ICU because of respiratory failure. Elevated plasmalevels of CT-pro-ET-1 are a potent marker of adverse outcome inour mixed cohort of critically ill patients. In the subgroup of patientsadmitted to the ICU because of respiratory failure due to a primarypulmonary cause or due to cardiogenic edema, however, elevationof P375 Serum high-mobility group box-1 protein as a specific marker of severe abdominal injury Y Sakamoto1, K Mashiko1, H Matsumoto1, H Medical School, Chiba, Japan; 2Nippon Japan Critical Care 2009, 13(Suppl 1): P375 (doi: 10.1186/cc7539) Introduction Trauma cases who have altered consciousness are candidates for missed injury of the abdomen. A specific marker ofsevere abdominal trauma would therefore be considered useful forrapid evaluation and treatment of abdominal injuries in traumacases. On the other hand, high-mobility group box-1 protein(HMGB1) has been widely studied in relation to its role in sepsisand inflammation [1,2].Methods We measured the serum HMGB1 concentrations in 50 consecutive trauma patients as early as possible after they arrivedin the emergency room. All cases with an abbreviated injury scaleover 3 were enrolled in the study. The correlations between theserum HMGB1 levels and the body region of injury were examined.Then, a comparative evaluation of the injury severity score, revisedtrauma score and probability of survival was conducted in thepatients with and without elevated serum HMGB1 concentrations.In addition, we measured the serum HMGB1 levels in 45 septicshock patients and the relationship between the HMGB1 level andunderlying disease.Results There were no significant correlations between the serum HMGB-1 levels and the presence of severe head, chest orextremity injury. On the other hand, the serum HMGB1 levels weresignificantly higher in the subject group with severe abdominalinjury (mean HMGB-1 level, 16.9 ng/ml; 10 cases) as comparedwith that in the subject group without severe abdominal injury(mean HMGB-1 level, 2.2 ng/ml; 40 cases) ( P = 0.0069). In septic shock patients, the serum HMGB1 levels were significantly higherin the subject group with peritonitis (mean HMGB-1 level,19.1 ng/ml; 22 cases) as compared with that in the subject groupwithout peritonitis (mean HMGB-1 level, 8.8 ng/ml; 23 cases)(P= 0.0447). Conclusions According to our data, high serum levels of HMGB1 were not correlated with an increased likelihood of head injury,chest injury or extremity injury, but were significantly correlated withthe presence of severe abdominal injury. This result suggests the possibility of the serum HMGB-1 level representing a specificmarker of severe abdominal injury.References1.

P376 LightCycler 1): P376 (doi: 10.1186/cc7540) Introduction The conventional sepsis diagnosis, using the cultivation technique, needs 24 hours for bacterial identificationand 36 hours for fungal. The use of empiric therapy makes thegrowth of bacteria and fungi slower or may yield negative findingsin many cases of septic shock. The molecular technique cancontribute to a more rapid and specific diagnosis in septic patients.SeptiFast detects 26 bacterial and fungal species DNAs, using thePCR in real time and giving results after 6 hours. This is importantfor de-escalation therapy and beginning of appropriate antibiotictreatment. The aim of this study is to evaluate the sensibility andthe specificity of the SeptiFast test versus traditional diagnosis.Methods We enrolled 16 patients admitted to the ICU in the past 6 months with surgical severe sepsis and septic shock. All patientswere treated with empiric antibiotics at the time of testing. Fungaland bacterial DNA was detected by the LightCycler SeptiFast. Wecompared the results of molecular diagnosis with the cultivationtechnique (BACTEC 9050) and microbiological blood cultureResults The preliminary results are presented in Table 1. Table 1 (abstract P376) Comparison of results BACTEC SeptiFast Conclusions The results of BACTEC and SeptiFast were the same in 12/16 (75%) patients. In 3/16 (18%) patients theSeptiFast test showed a positive result, not detected by BACTEC.In only 1/16 (6%) we found a positivity in BACTEC, and negativityin SeptiFast. This result was probably due to contamination ofsamples for BACTEC. SeptiFast is a valuable add-on to thetraditional gold standard with cultivation methods, also duringantimicrobial treatment. This study represents a limited assessmentof the PCR's performance. To properly assess the clinical value ofthis technique, a prospective study with a larger population couldbe useful.Available online http://ccforum.com/supplements/13/S1S154P377 Differential diagnosis of systemic inflammatory response syndrome versus sepsis based on a multiplex quantitative PCR assay A 10.1186/cc7541) Introduction Differential diagnosis of systemic inflammation versus sepsis is based primarily on clinical criteria and laboratory teststhat lack the required sensitivity and specificity. This dilemma holdstrue for medical as well as surgical patients, for example afterbypass surgery or autoimmune disease. Both populations arecharacterized by the presence of signs of systemic inflammation orby increased risk for nosocomial infection and, thus, reflect patientpopulations at risk for sepsis with significant diagnosticuncertainty. Novel and robust biomarkers are urgently needed tocorrectly and timely identify infection as the underlying cause of asystemic host response because each hour of delay of anti-infectious therapy leads to increased mortality.Methods We analyzed the clinical utility of a new class of trans- criptomic biomarkers derived from circulating leukocytes. Prospec-tively collected whole blood samples from 460 patients admitted tothe operative ICU were included in a microarray/quantitative PCRstudy to identify sensitive and specific biomarkers. Theidentification of a signature specific for the discrimination betweensystemic inflammatory response syndrome and sepsis in patientssuffering from shock and organ dysfunction was performed inindependent training and test phases. The training set of 96patients was selected by an independent ICU committee.Results An algorithm was established combining and transforming the gene-expression signals into a continuous, nondimensionalscore indicating either infectious or noninfectious causes for organdysfunction. The resulting classificator was validated in a test setcomprising 1,784 ICU-days of 364 patients. For each marker, arobust quantitative PCR assay was established. The finalmicroarray signature could be transferred into a multiplex quanti-tative PCR format retaining full sensitivity and specificity with timeto result of approximately 5 hours. Moreover, it could bedemonstrated that the combination of seven biomarkers possessesthe same accuracy compared with the complete biomarker set.The AUC in the test group was determined as 0.79 (procalcitonin0.65, C-reactive protein 0.67).Conclusions With its high predictive value for the differentiation between infectious and none infectious causes of shock and organdysfunction, this new class of biomarkers may help to identifypatients with life-threatening infections among patients at risk andto guide therapy, for example with anti-infective agents. P378 Sepsis in the emergency department: pathogen identification by blood cultures and PCR S Hettwer, J Wilhelm, D Hammer, M Sch\u00fcrmann, M Amoury, S Scheubel, F Hofmann, P378 (doi: 10.1186/cc7542) Introduction Sepsis in the early stage is a common disease in emergency medicine, and rapid diagnosis is essential. The aim ofour monocentric observational study (characterization of patientswith sepsis in the emergency department) was to compare pathogen diagnosis by blood cultures (BC) and PCR.Methods Two (aerobic and anaerobic) BC and blood for PCR testing were taken from the patients immediately after admission,before initiating antibiotic therapy. For PCR testing we used theLightCycler SeptiFast (Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland),which enables rapid diagnosis of the 20 most important sepsis-pathogens. SeptiFast test kits were provided free of charge.Results We analyzed 95 patients with suspected severe infection. Thirty-four patients (35.8%) had a PCT value 2 ng/ml and were classified as septic. In septic and nonseptic patients, age (63.8 \u00b117.7 vs. 62.9 \u00b1 7.4 years, P = NS) and male sex (60.3% vs. 64.1%, P = NS) were comparable. Thirty-five patients (36.8% of total and 44.1% of septic) had positive BC, and 32 patients(33.7% of total and 52.9% of septic) had positive PCR tests.Septic patients showed significantly more positive PCR resultsthan nonseptic patients ( P <0.01). No difference was found for BC. PCR showed an accordance of 84.4% to BC. In 11.4% ofpatients BC was positive and PCR was negative PCRrecognition spectrum, Micrococcus luteus agent Streptococcus coagulase-negative identified PCR and BC, n= 3). In seven patients (7.3%) with negative BC, additional, mostly Gram-negative bacteria were foundby PCR. The PCR-positive in comparison with PCR-negativepatients had significantly higher values for procalcitonin (17.3 \u00b126.4 APACHE II score (19.1 \u00b1 9.1 vs. 14.6 \u00b1 8.8, P <0.05) and Sequential Organ Failure Assess- ment score (4.5 \u00b1 3.4 vs. 2.9 \u00b1 2.6, P <0.05). For BC-positive patients a difference was found only for Sequential Organ FailureAssessment score (4.0 \u00b1 3.0 vs. 2.9 \u00b1 2.6, P<0.05). Conclusions In septic patients in the emergency department, PCR identifies pathogens in about 50%. A positive PCR correlates withsepsis severity as well as the inflammatory response of the host. P379 Rapid detection and identification of pathogens in critically ill and immunocompromised hosts using molecular techniques M Prucha1, S Pekova1, P Czech Republic; 4Institute of 2009, 13(Suppl 1): P379 (doi: 10.1186/cc7543) Introduction Infectious complications in immunocompromised patients and critically ill patients represent a serious clinicalproblem. In these individuals, not only common nosocomial agentsbut also very unusual pathogens, pathogens with specific cultiva-tion demands or fastidious pathogens can be identified. Timelyinformation on the causative agents is highly important for rapidand accurate clinical decision-making and targeted pharmaco-therapy.Methods Patients fulfilling the criteria for sepsis, severe sepsis and septic shock, as well as patients with hematological malignancies,patients undergoing chemotherapy, and transplant and post-transplant patients were included in our cohort. We developed asystem employing pathogen-specific probes and real-time PCRtechnology to detect the 25 most frequent human pathogenscausing severe nosocomial infections and five fastidiouspathogens causing pulmonary infections. Each sample has alsoCritical Care March 2009 Vol 13 Suppl 1 29th International Symposium on Intensive Care and Emergency MedicineS155been tested using a pan-bacterial and pan-fungal broad-range PCR system coupled with direct sequencing of PCR products for precise identification of the causative agents. Results We have investigated 548 clinical samples (peripheral blood 236 samples, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) 186 samples, cerebrospinal fluid 32 samples, sputum 29 samples, aspirate from thorax cavity 19 samples, drainage fluids 12 samples, abscesses 11 samples, urine 10 samples, tissue 13 samples). In addition to common pathogens we have identified a set of unusual and fastidious pathogens: Chlamydiophilla pneumoniae technique coupled with direct pan-bacterial and pan-fungal sequencing represents a very fast and useful tool to accelerate and refine the diagnostics of infections in critically ill patients. P380 Microalbuminuria: a biomarker of sepsis S (doi: 10.1186/cc7544) Introduction Assessment of microalbuminuria as a diagnostic tool in predicting sepsis in the critically ill patient. Methods A prospective observational study in a 20-bed ICU in a tertiary-care hospital. Microalbuminuria estimated as the spot urine albumin-creatinine ratio (ACR, mg/g) was measured on ICU admission (ACR1) and after 24 hours (ACR2). A total of 242 patients were recruited for the study between January 2007 and May 2008. Patients with an ICU stay of less than 24 hours, pregnancy, menstruation, anuria, hematuria, urinary tract infection, and proteinuria due to renal and postrenal structural diseases were excluded. Results Patients with sepsis ( n= 95) had a significantly higher median ACR1 46 to 305)) and ACR2 (104.3 (IQR 179)) in comparison with ( n= 147) (ACR1 = 56.6 (IQR 27 to 111) ACR2 = 37.8 (IQR 18 to 93)) (P< 0.0001) (Figure 1). In a receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, ACR1 emerged as the most reliable indicator of sepsis (area under curve (AUC) of ACR1 = 0.710 of 50.5% and specificity of 87.1% with positive predictive value of 71.6% and negative predictive value of 73.1% in diagnosis of sepsis. Conclusions Absence of significant microalbuminuria at the time of ICU admission is unlikely to be associated with sepsis. P381 Newly developed endotoxin measurement method (endotoxin activity assay) may reflect the severity of sepsis H Murayama, Y Kakihana, T Oryoji, N Kiyonaga, S Tashiro, T Yasuda, Y Kanmura Kagoshima P381 (doi: 10.1186/cc7545) Introduction Endotoxin (ET) of the Gram- negative bacilli extracellular membrane, which activates target cells including macrophages and neutrophils, and causes septic shock. But it is known that the conventional ET measurement method has many problems; for example, a discrepancy between plasma ET concentration and clinical manifestation in the septic patient. We therefore evaluate the usefulness of a new developed method to measure the plasma ET activity (endotoxin activity assay (EAA)) [1] in patients under sepsis compared with the ordinary method of the limulus amebocyte lysate (LAL) assay. Methods With institutional approval and informed consent, we measured the EAA in 40 patients (aged 63.5 \u00b1 17.7 years) admitted to the ICU. The EAA was measured using a chemi- luminometer (Autolumat LB953; EG & G. Berthold). Patients were divided to five categories: (1) control group, (2) systemic inflam- matory response syndrome (SIRS) group, (3) sepsis (SIRS and infection) group, (4) severe sepsis group, and (5) septic shock group. We then compared the EAA level between each group and control group. We made the statistical evaluation by unpaired ttest and a significant difference was P <0.05. Results The EAA levels were significantly increased as sepsis severity rises. The measured EAA levels were (0.18 \u00b1 0.34) in control, SIRS, sepsis, severe sepsis and septic shock groups, respectively. In the LAL method, four of the severe sepsis group and two of the septic shock group exceeded the cutoff value. In the EAA level, severe patients had a tendency to exceed the cutoff value. There was no significant correlation between the EAA level and ET density. Conclusions This newly developed method named EAA measures ET using anti-lipopolysaccharide monoclonal antibody. Our trial suggests this method can evaluate the severity of sepsis correctly compared with the usual method of measuring ET. Reference 1.

S156P382 Activated protein C-protein C inhibitor complex as a prognostic marker in sepsis L Heslet1, 10.1186/cc7546) Introduction The PROWESS study and later trials of activated protein C (APC) treatment in sepsis have shown only modestreductions in mortality. A recent Cochrane systematic review(CD004388) records doubtful efficacy and serious adverseeffects. To optimize the benefit/risk ratio of APC treatment of eachpatient, a biomarker of protein C (PC) activation is urgentlyneeded, and the use of such a marker, APC-protein C inhibitor(PCI), has been investigated in the present study.Methods APC-PCI was measured in acid citrate plasma by means of a newly developed sandwich ELISA (median normalvalue 0.13 ng/ml, range 0.07 to 0.26, n= 16). Levels of APC-PCI and PC were monitored (daily to alternate days) in 135consecutive critically ill patients, 53 of whom had sepsis during theobservation period. The state of PC activation ng/ml), based on maximum values inrelation to the normal range.Results The maximum APC-PCI values ranged from 0.03 to 29 ng/ml, median 0.44 ng/ml. The overall mortality of the 53 sepsispatients was 32% (17/53). The mortality in the A bell-shaped mortality relationshipwas with high mortalities in both the nonactivated and highlyactivated groups, and a much lower mortality in the moderatelyactivated group. Subdividing the PC activation groups accordingto APACHE II score yielded the highest mortality, 71% (5/7), in thenonactivated subgroup with APACHE II 25, whereas the APACHE II score showed no relationship with mortality in the otherPC activation groups. Minimum PC levels did not correlate withAPC-PCI and showed no significant differences between theactivation groups.Conclusions Nonactivation of PC in sepsis may represent the failure of an appropriate protective response and is thereforeassociated with increased mortality, especially when the APACHEII score is elevated. Septic patients without PC activation and ahigh APACHE II score may be those who are most likely to benefitfrom APC treatment. PC measurements were not predictive of PCactivation as indicated by APC-PCI levels. P383 Copeptin is a strong and independent predictor of outcome in cardiogenic shock B Meyer1, P Wexberg1, J Struck2, stress is significantly increased in acute hemodynamic instability. AVP isreleased in response to osmotic and haemodynamic changesaiming to maintain fluid volume and vascular tone. Copeptin is astable fragment of pre-pro-vasopressin that equimolar quantities as AVP, copeptin is highly stable ex vivo . We aimed to test the prognostic potency of an elevation of copeptin in patients with cardiogenic shock.Methods In this prospective observational study we included consecutive patients with cardiogenic shock admitted to the ICUof the Department of Cardiology/Medical University of Viennabetween November 2004 and March 2006. In all patients, bloodsamples for determination of routine laboratory tests and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-pro-BNP) and copeptinplasma using an immunoassay in the chemiluminescence/coatedtube format. Copeptin, NT-pro-BNP, age, gender, presence ofacute renal failure and mechanical ventilation were analysed forprediction of ICU survival.Results We included 91 consecutive patients (66 male (72%), age 66.5 \u00b1 11.4 years) with diagnosis of cardiogenic shock onICU admission. All patients required intravenous inotropic support,19 patients (21%) were treated with an intraaortic counter-pulsation and nine patients (9%) were on extracorporeal circulatorysupport (eight patients (8%) had an (1%) was on novacor support). Fifty-sixpatients (62%) survived and 35 patients (38%) died. Copeptinplasma levels were significantly higher in ICU logistic regression model, copeptin was the best predictor ofICU survival, with only NT-pro-BNP providing independentadditional information (copeptin 1.002; P= 0.001 and NT-pro-BNP OR = 1.001; P = 0.05). Conclusions Elevated plasma levels of copeptin are a strong and independent predictor of adverse outcome in patients withcardiogenic shock. P384 Daily assay of procalcitonin, C-reactive protein and IL-6 roles in diagnosis and management of severe sepsis M Umbrello, S Marzorati, E Mantovani, F P384 (doi: 10.1186/cc7548) Introduction Early diagnosis of sepsis is crucial for management and outcome of critically ill patients. The use of clinical parameters,white cell count or body temperature proved far from ideal inidentifying patients who need antimicrobial therapy. The lack of asensible and specific marker of infection may be responsible fordelaying or prolonging antibiotic use [1]. The aims of this workwere to test the predictive ability of the serial monitoring of IL-6,procalcitonin (PCT), and C-reactive protein (CRP) to stratify thedifferent levels of sepsis and to assess whether their measurementcould add to the therapeutic decision-making process during long-term ICU stay.Methods In a prospective observational study we studied the time course of inflammatory markers in consecutive cases of long-termcritical illness in the general ICU of a university hospital. Daily serawere subsequently analyzed for CRP, PCT and IL-6 (only in the last16 patients) in all patients with length of stay >6 days.Results We enrolled 26 patients, for a total of 592 days. In seven patients that never experienced severe sepsis/septic shock CRP,PCT and IL-6 levels decreased over time, the 14 who recoveredhad a reduction of markers, while no variation was found in fivepatients expired in sepsis. One hundred and ninety-eight daysclassified vs. 199.18Critical Care March 2009 Vol 13 Suppl 1 29th International Symposium on Intensive Care and Emergency MedicineS157(105.51 to 289.27)) higher than 394 SIRS/sepsis days, P <0.001. Prediction of severe sepsis/septic shock (receiver operatingcharacteristic area) was 0.59 \u00b1 <0.001). Forty-four antibiotic courses were recorded; the initial value of markers was higher than the lastday, and mean course values were higher than those withoutantibiotics. Adopting 0.25 ng/ml as the PCT cutoff value betweeninfection expected to be treated with antibiotics and inflammationwithout the need for antibiotic therapy, inappropriate antibiotictreatment was given on 202/592 days.Conclusions Daily measure of PCT, at variance of CRP or IL-6, is accurate in discriminating a day spent in severe sepsis/septicshock. An antimicrobial therapy policy based only on clinicaldiagnosis proved ineffective, with 34% of inappropriate days thatcould have been saved using a PCT-guided antibiotic strategy.Reference1. Nobre V, et al.: Use of procalcitonin to shorten antibiotic treatment duration in septic patients: a randomized trial.Am J Respir Crit Care P385 Effect of a clinical procalcitonin algorithm to guide antibiotic therapy in patients with lower respiratory tract infections outside study conditions: a post-study survey P Schuetz1, M Batschwaroff2, (PCT) algorithm was demonstrated to reduce antibiotic exposure in patients with lower respiratory tractinfections (LRTI) in several randomised controlled trials. Data onthe efficacy of PCT-guided antibiotic stewardship in real life andoutside study conditions are lacking.Methods We prospectively monitored antibiotic therapy and adherence to the published PCT algorithm in consecutivehospitalized patients with LRTI admitted to the Aarau(Switzerland), a former ProHOSP study hospital [1], between Apriland November 2008.Results Median age of the 130 included patients (36% females) was 70 (IQR 57 to 82) years. Community-acquired pneumoniawas diagnosed in 78%, while 17% had acute and hadexacerbation of chronic bronchitis. Mortality rate was 11.5% and6.9% of patients needed ICU admission. In 70% of patients(n= 91), antibiotics were administered or withheld according to the PCT algorithm. In the 39 patients (30%) where the PCTalgorithm was overruled, the main reasons were severeimmunosuppression (30%), high-risk LRTI (13%), other infections(8%) and clinical judgement of the treating physician (33%).Overall, the median duration of antibiotic therapy was 6 days (IQR1 to 10), 4 days (IQR 0 to 7) when the PCT algorithm wasfollowed and 10 days (IQR 8 to 14) when it was overruled,respectively. In patients with community-acquired pneumonia,median days on antibiotic therapy was 7 days (IQR 4 to 10), whichwas similar to the PCT group in a trial in the same institution(P= 0.44) [1]. Conclusions The present study mirrors the use of PCT-guided antibiotic therapy in clinical practice and outside trial conditions.Antibiotic exposure, however, strongly depends on the adherenceto a clinical PCT algorithm.Reference1.

P386 Effect of procalcitonin-based guidelines compared with standard guidelines on antibiotic use in lower respiratorytract infections: the randomized-controlled multicenter Introduction In previous smaller trials, a procalcitonin algorithm reduced antibiotic use in patients with lower respiratory tractinfections. However, the feasibility and safety of this approach in amulticenter setting has not been demonstrated.Methods We enrolled 1,359 consecutive patients with lower respiratory tract infections admitted to emergency departments ofsix tertiary-care hospitals in Switzerland. Patients were randomizedto administration of antibiotics based on a procalcitonin algorithmwith predefined cutoff ranges for initiating or stopping antibiotics(procalcitonin group) or according to standard guidelines (controlgroup). Procalcitonin was measured locally in each hospital andinstructions were web-based. The primary endpoint of thisnoninferiority trial was the composite adverse outcome of death,ICU admission, disease-specific complications or recurrent infec-tion requiring antibiotic treatment within 30 days.Results The rate of overall adverse outcomes was similar in the procalcitonin and the control group (15.5% vs. 18.9%; difference-3.4%, = -7.5% the procalcitonin group,antibiotic exposure (that is, number of days on antibiotics perpatient) was significantly lower as compared with the control groupoverall (34.8% reduction, P <0.001), and in subgroups of patients with community-acquired pneumonia ( n= 925, 32.4% reduction), exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary n= 50.4% and acute bronchitis ( n= reduction). Antibiotic-associated side effects were less frequent inthe procalcitonin group as compared with the control group(19.8% vs. 28.1%; P <0.001). Conclusions In this multicenter setting, without increasing the rate of adverse outcomes, procalcitonin guidance markedly reducedantibiotic exposure and antibiotic-associated side effects inpatients with lower respiratory tract infections.ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT00350987. P387 Optimization of antibiotic therapy by procalcitonin D Popov, N Beloborodova, A SedrakyanBakoulev Scientific Center (PCT) is routinely used as a specific marker of severe bacterial infections and sepsis. The highlysensitive method of PCT measurement allows using PCT as aAvailable online http://ccforum.com/supplements/13/S1S158marker of local bacterial infections. By this method, the normal value of PCT is defined as <0.25 ng/ml - but according to some publications PCT <0.1 ng/ml is a more reliable cutoff point to reject diagnosis of local bacterial infection. Some patients after major surgery have nonspecific signs of infection (for example, fever, leukocytosis) that is usually discussed as true infection and antibiotic therapy (ABT) is provided. We tried to optimize ABT in patients undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass using PCT. Methods Sixty-six patients aged from 2 days to 72 years (39 adults, 27 children) with nonspecific signs of infection without its focus were studied. Seventy-six PCT tests from blood plasma were made (PCT sensitive LIA; BRAHMS, Germany) to decide whether ABT is sufficient or antibiotics should be prescribed/changed/ discontinued. Results Based on PCT testing results we have made following decisions (see Figure 1). As Figure 1 shows, when PCT was <0.1 ng/ml antibiotics were discontinued or not prescribed in 61% of cases. In 30% of cases we prolonged ABT for several days. Only in 9% cases were antibiotics changed. In patients who had PCT of 0.1 to 0.25 ng/ml we tended to continue or change ABT (77%). If elevated PCT levels (>0.25 ng/ml) were detected, we prescribed (20%) or reinforced (73%) ABT in the majority of cases. In total we discontinued or did not prescribe antibiotics in 31/76 cases (41%) taking into consideration the results of PCT testing. We did not register progression of bacterial infection in those cases with the exception of one 10-month patient with mild exacerbation of bronchitis. Conclusions There is a big need to optimize ABT in postoperative period in cardiac surgery patients due to significant overuse of antibiotics. PCT-guided tactics are safe and allowed reduction of unnecessary antibiotic usage in patients with nonspecific signs of infection. At the same time, supernormal PCT levels are a strong indicator to prescribe or change ABT. P388 Procalcitonin: a prognostic marker for critically ill M Bhattacharyya, S Todi AMRI 10.1186/cc7552) Introduction Procalcitonin (PCT) is a marker of sepsis and the levels correlate with the severity of illness. Methods A prospective, observational study conducted in the medical surgical intensive therapy unit of a tertiary-care centre in India. Three hundred critically ill adult patients with suspected sepsis during any time of the intensive therapy unit stay in whom PCT was estimated were included in the study. PCT was assessed by quantitative immunoluminometric assay. The demographics of the study population, and APACHE II and APACHE IV scores were recorded. Results Demographic character of the study population was as follows: median age 61 years, male:female ratio 174:126, medianAPACHE II and APACHE IV scores 17 and 59, respectively, and medical:surgical patients 265:35. See Table 1 and Figure 1 for receiver operating characteristic analysis. Conclusions PCT is a reliable marker for prognostication with a high negative predictive value and comparable with APACHE prediction models.

Previous work has found that raised plasma CRPindependently predicted, in separate studies, each of these twopoor outcomes [1,2]. We investigated whether these results couldbe repeated in our mixed medical/surgical ICU for a compositepoor outcome measure combining death and readmission.Methods We prospectively enrolled a cohort comprised of all ICU admissions over 1 year. We collected admission clinical anddemographic data and APACHE II scores. At discharge werecorded the white cell count and serum levels of CRP andalbumin, and we observed death and readmission outcomes up to2 weeks after ICU discharge. This time period was chosen on thegrounds that an association between discharge CRP andpostdischarge outcome should relate to persisting inflammatoryactivity and would be of most relevance in the short term.Results Of 1,487 admissions to our ICU, 181 (12.2%) resulted in the patient's death on the ICU and 110 (7.4%) ended with eitherthe patient's discharge to another hospital or ICU and thus theirloss to follow up. Eleven patients discharged for palliation wereexcluded from analysis. A total of 1,185 (79.7%) were dischargedto a ward in the hospital and so could potentially have suffered anunexpected deterioration resulting in ICU readmission or death. Ofthese, 117 (9.9%) of the discharge episodes were followed by anunexpected poor outcome of either readmission ( n = 83, 7.0%) ordeath ( n=34, 2.9%) within 2 weeks. A composite outcome measure combining these two poor outcomes was associated withage, higher APACHE II score, and a low plasma albumin on ICUdischarge. Means and median values were compared usingP<0.05 as the test of significance. Plasma CRP on discharge from the ICU was not associated with this composite measure.Conclusions In a mixed medical/surgical ICU, CRP on the day of discharge is not associated with a poor outcome measure ofunexpected readmission or ward death.References1.

P392 Influence of age on the distribution of morphine and morphine-3-glucuronide across the blood-brain barrier in sheep P Ederoth1, J Bengtsson2, D Ley1, are recommended smaller doses of morphine than adults and, accordingly, we hypothesised that thedistribution of morphine and its metabolites over the blood-brainbarrier differs between these age groups. In addition, neonatalasphyxia, with potentially harmful effects on the brain, in theory,might further affect the pharmacokinetics of substances over theblood-brain barrier.Methods During anaesthesia, microdialysis probes were inserted into the brain cortex and in a central vein of 11 exteriorized near-term lambs (127 gestation days) and six nonpregnant adult sheep.Five of these lambs were subjected to 10 minutes of asphyxiathrough umbilical cord occlusion during delivery. Morphine,1 mg/kg, was thereafter intravenously administered as a 10 minuteconstant infusion. Microdialysis and blood samples were collectedfor up to 360 minutes after morphine administration, and analyzedusing liquid chromatography followed by tandem massspectrometry. Data presented as the mean \u00b1 SD.Results The morphine unbound drug brain:blood distribution 1.19 \u00b1 0.20 and 1.89 \u00b1 0.51 for the sheep and premature lambs without asphyxia, respectively ( P = 0.018). The half-lives in the blood and brain cortex, clearance, volume ofdistribution, and distribution in the brain of unbound drug were allnumerically significantly higher in the adult sheep as comparedwith the premature lambs. The morphine-3-glucuronide K p,uuvalues were 0.27 \u00b1 0.16 and 0.17 \u00b1 0.15 in sheep and premature lambs(P = NS), indicating a net efflux from the brain in both groups. Induced asphyxia did not affect the results.Conclusions The morphine K p,uuwas above unity, indicating a net influx of morphine into the brain. In addition, influx was significantlyhigher in premature lambs than in adult sheep. We interpret this asan active transport of morphine into the brain, which may becounteracted with increased efflux with age. Further, neonatalasphyxia did not change these pharmacokinetic findings. The K p,uu in the sheep was different from the values obtained in humans (0.64), rats (0.49), mice (0.5) and pigs (0.47), where a net efflux ofmorphine from the brain was online O Kimberger, 10.1186/cc7557) Introduction Decreased intestinal microcirculatory an important contributor to perioperative anesthesia (EA) improve intestinal MBF [1] found that EA decreases cardiac output (CO) andthus compromises intestinal MBF [2]. We tested whether MBF comparedwith colloid administration alone.Methods Twenty pigs (30 \u00b1 2.5 kg) were anesthetized and venti- lated. A laparotomy was performed for instrumentation and a colonanastomosis. After baseline measurements the animals were randomlyassigned to one of the following treatments: Group HES, hydroxyethylstarch (130/0.4) was given to maintain SvO 260%; Group EA, in addition to the same colloid treatment an epidural catheter wasinserted at the lumbar level and after a bolus of 4 ml ropivacain 0.2%,7 ml/hour were continuously administered. The CO and MBF in themucosa of the jejunum, colon and anastomosis were measured.Results In both groups the CO and MBF increased similarly (Table 1). No difference in the circulatory parameters between thetwo groups was found. However, in Group EA significantly morefluids (56%) were administered to achieve SvO 260%.

Conclusions The present study did not show any positive effects of epidural anesthesia on intestinal microcirculatory blood flow.

P394 Epidural analgesia compared with peripheral nerve blockade after major knee surgery E Tricarico, S Tomasino, 10.1186/cc7558) Introduction The aim of this study was to undertake a randomized trial between lumbar continuous epidural analgesia and continuousfemoral blockade in adults undergoing major knee surgery, including comparison of analgesic efficacy [1], side effects, patientsatisfaction and rehabilitation indices [2].Methods We studied 91 patients in 2 years that were randomized into two groups: epidural group (EG) 40 and femoral group (FG)51. All patients received spinal anesthesia with 1 ml of 1% bupiva-caine without a narcotic. The EG received + ketorolac 30 mg intravenously x 3.Results No statistically significant difference was noted between the two groups about pain scores (VAS at rest and on movement),nausea, vomiting, arterial hypotension, morphine consumption,headache, pruritus, patient satisfaction and indices(active knee flexion). A statistically significant difference was notedbetween the two groups about contralateral analgesia, urinaryretention that required bladder catheterization and motor blockwith major incidence in the EG.Conclusions Continuous femoral blockade represents the best balance between analgesia and side effects as a choice ofpostoperative analgesic technique for major knee surgery,especially as the risk of injury to the neuraxis is negligible. Overall,however, we believe that there is no sufficient evidence that lumbarepidural analgesia should not be used S, Myles PS: with peripheral nerve blockade after majorknee surgery: a systematic review and meta-analysis ofrandomized trials.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate postconditioningeffects following sevoflurane or propofol administration in patientsafter elective cardiac surgery.Methods Fifty patients either received sevoflurane via ACD or propofol for ICU sedation. The primary endpoint was a change introponine T (TNT), besides measures brain natriuretic peptide points were set at baseline, end ofsurgery, 24 hours and 48 hours after surgery.Results TNT and CK-MB levels were significantly higher (P<0.0001) at all measure points compared with baseline in each group, without any significant differences between both groups.NT-proBNP values were significantly lower following sevoflurane at24 and 48 hours ( P <0.05) compared (Figure 1). Conclusions Postoperative sevoflurane sedation via ACD led to lower NT-proBNP levels at 24 and 48 hours, while TNT and CK-MB values were comparable in both study groups.Critical Care March 2009 Vol 13 Suppl 1 29th International Symposium on Intensive Care and Emergency MedicineS161References 1.

P396 trial of using daily wake-up calls, bispectral index or clinical sedation scores in a mixed medical-surgical ICU population J Binnekade1, R Wilde2, AJ Slooter3, the Netherlands; Care 2009, 13(Suppl 1): P396 (doi: 10.1186/cc7560) Introduction Daily interruption of continuous infusions of sedatives (wake-up calls (WC)) has been found previously to promote more rapid withdrawal of ventilatory support in ICU patients. Bispectral index (BIS) monitoring has been reported to adequately describe the depth of sedation in critically ill patients. We compared the effectiveness and safety of both sedation strategies in a mixed medical-surgical ICU population. Methods Patients expected to need sedation for at least 1 day were randomly assigned to a WC strategy, sedation guided by BIS, or a control group. Clinical assessment of the sedation depth, the Ramsay score, was performed in all three groups. Primary outcome: ICU length of stay (LOS); secondary outcomes: duration of mechanical ventilation, accidental removal of indwelling devices, ICU readmission rate, hospital LOS, 90-day mortality, and stressful events (interview at ICU exit and after 3 months). Results In four ICUs, three academic and one teaching hospital, a total number of 617 patients was randomized; 205 to the WC strategy, 202 to sedation guided by BIS, and 210 to the control group. The study groups were well balanced according to baseline characteristics. Neither ICU LOS (median (IQR) 11 (6 to 21) (WC), 12 (7 to 23) (BIS), and 11 (6 to 24) days (control),P= 0.67) nor duration of mechanical ventilation (median 165 (0 to 581) (WC), 158 (3 to 590) (BIS), and 163 (5 to 385) hours control, P= 0.97) were different between groups. Accidental removal of indwelling devices was encountered 37 times (10 times in nine patients (WC), six times in five patients (BIS), and 21 times in 11 patients (control), P= 0.01). The ICU readmission rate, hospital LOS, and 90-day mortality were not different between groups. Interviews showed similar stress experiences. Conclusions Although a significant higher number of incidents with indwelling devices occurred in the control group, no additional differences between the three sedation regimens were revealed. Although current guidelines on ICU sedation have incorporated WC next to clinical sedation scales, the results from this larger study do not promote either WC or BIS in guiding sedation of ICU patients. P397 Safety and length of different sedations for endoscopic procedures O Martinez, A Algaba, D Ballesteros, M Chana, B Estebanez, B Lopez, C Martin, L Vigil, R Blancas Hospital del Tajo, Aranjuez, Spain P397 (doi: 10.1186/cc7561) Introduction Endoscopic procedures have improved thanks to the fact that they are performed currently under sedation. We describe a series of endoscopic studies, sedated by the Intensive Care Department. Different sedation protocols are described, empha- sizing some patients sedated with ketamine plus midazolam, drugs rarely reported for adults. Methods Patients older than 18 years, whose performed endoscopic, colonoscopic or both procedures under sedation were performed by the Intensive Care Department of the Hospital del Tajo. Data were collected for 6 months. Demographic characteristics, medical history, American Society of Anesthes- iology classification, drugs bolus and total dosages, respiratory and hemodynamic data, the length of procedure and recovery, and complications were collected. Tolerance was assessed by an endoscopist, with a 1 (very bad) to 5 (very good) scale. Different indices of two groups of treatment were compared, propofol- fentanyl (Group A) versus ketamine-midazolam (Group B) using the chi-square test and the Student t test. Results In total, 245 procedures were included. The procedures were 168 (66.6%) colonoscopies, 34 (13.9%) endoscopies and were 2. There were 72 (29.39%) complications, the most common hypotension being 22 (8.98%) and respiratory depression 12 (4.9%). Length of procedure was 31.20 minutes (SD = 15.53) and recovery time was 64.86 minutes (SD = 37.56). Comparing Group A versus Group B, hypotension (12.67% vs. P= 0.023) and respira- tory depression (6.67% vs. 0%, P = 0.03) were more frequent with Group A. Group B presented a higher percentage of vomiting (0% vs. 5.8%, P= 0.009) and hallucinations (0% vs. 11.59%, P< 0.001). The length of recovery was longer for Group B (61.12 min vs. 78.98 min, P = 0.008). Conclusions Sedation for endoscopic procedures performed by intensivists is safe and well tolerated for most patients, with a similar percentage of complications compared with previous reports. Ketamine plus midazolam are safe and could be useful for short-length sedation in patients with a high risk of respiratory depression.Available online http://ccforum.com/supplements/13/S1 Figure 1 (abstract P395) NT-proBNP levels. S162P398 Novel responsiveness index measures the level of sedation in cardiac ICU patients P Lapinlampi1, H Vierti\u00f6-Oja1, M K Uutela1, Helsinki, P398 (doi: 10.1186/cc7562) Introduction Sedation is an integral part of the management of patients requiring mechanical ventilation in the ICU. At present, sedation is usually managed by clinical assessments, often in conjunction with a protocol for adjusting drug doses. This approach has been shown to decrease ventilation times and is considered the best practice in recent guidelines [1]. Such scales, however, provide only intermittent and, to some extent, subjective information about the patient's state. Also, not every scale used in clinical practice is validated for ICU use and interobserver variation may occur. Methods We have developed a novel method that analyzes the patterns in the electromyographic (EMG) component of the frontal biopotential signal that are associated with activation and arousal processes. By quantifying the amount and magnitude of the response patterns in the past 60 minutes, a responsiveness index (RI) ranging between 0 and 100 (0 corresponds to a nonresponsive patient and 100 to a high amount of responses) is derived. Previously, we have compared the RI with EEG spectral entropy [2] in general ICU patients. Now we have studied the performance of the RI with 17 cardiac ICU patients and compared these with the development dataset analyzed by Vierti\u00f6-Oja and colleagues [2]. A subgroup of 17 patients (of total 30 patients) with a clinically assessed low probability of encephalopathy was used as the primary development data. The patients in both datasets were consenting adult ICU patients with non-neurologic primary ICU diagnosis. A modified Ramsay score was used as a reference of the sedation level. Results The performance of the RI in reference to the Ramsay scores was analyzed by computing the prediction probability ( PK). The development and test data contained 213 and 96 eligible Ramsay assessments, respectively. The PKfor separating deep sedation levels 4 to 6 from levels 1 to 3 was 0.91 (0.03) in the development data and 0.96 (0.02) in the test data. For separating all Ramsay levels, the PKvalues in the development data and test data were 0.82 (0.02) and 0.89 (0.02), respectively. Conclusions These results showed good RI performance in the cardiac ICU data. The RI continues to show promise as an indicator of the level of sedation in ICU patients. References 1.

Methods All consecutive patients admitted to a 14-bed medical-surgical ICU were retrospectively studied from 2000 to 2006 after implementation of NIV (2000 to 2001) and sedation protocols (2003 to 2004). The duration of mechanical ventilation shown by categories was analyzed using a chi-square test. Results During the 7 years of the study, 2,839 admissions were performed in 2,511 patients (59 \u00b1 17 years, women 36%, medical admission 43%, Simplified Acute Physiology Score II 38 \u00b1 17, mortality in the ICU 17%). The incidence and duration of IMV significantly decreased during the study ( P <0.001) (Figure 1). The NIV use progressively increased during the study period, both in medical and surgical patients. Conclusions These results showed that the implementation of sedation protocols for intubated patients added to the imple- mentation of NIV decreased moreover the duration of IMV. P400 Does choice of sedative agent affect duration of ICU stay, mortality or neurological outcome in patients undergoing therapeutic hypothermia? M Gillies, R Pratt, J Borg, J Brooks, C Mckenzie, S Tibby Guy's & St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust, Care 2009, 13(Suppl 1): P400 (doi: 10.1186/cc7564) Introduction The effect of therapeutic hypothermia on sedative drug clearance and neurological prognostication is unknown. Hypothermia has been shown to affect clearance of drugs metabolised by the cytochrome p450 system (fentanyl, midazolam and muscle relaxants) [1]. We undertook a retrospective study to ascertain whether the use of remifentanil sedation was associated with reduced duration of ICU stay, ventilation, mortality or neuro- logical outcome compared with fentanyl in patients undergoing therapeutic hypothermia. Methods Data were collected on all patients undergoing thera- peutic hypothermia in a 2.5-year period using the Carevue ICU Database (Phillips) and case-note review. All patients received propofol and either remifentanil or fentanyl as sedation. Patient demographic data included age, weight, sex, APACHE II, time to return of spontaneous circulation and arrest type. Measured outcomes were ICU-free days, ventilator-free days, ICU mortality,Critical Care March 2009 Vol 13 Suppl 1 29th International Symposium on Intensive Care and Emergency Medicine Figure 1 (abstract P399) S163hospital mortality and neurological outcome at hospital discharge. Good neurological outcome was classified as Pittsburgh CerebralPerformance Criteria grade 1 to 2 at hospital discharge [2].Predictive models used multivariable logistic regression.Results Eighty-three patients received therapeutic hypothermia (crude ICU mortality 43%, median APACHE II score 18); of which54 received fentanyl sedation and 29 remifentanil. In themultivariable models, remifentanyl was not associated with ICU(P= 0.35) or hospital ( P= 0.22) mortality or good neurological outcome ( P= 0.75). However, remifentanyl was associated with a positive trend towards an increase in both ventilator-free and ICU-free days (both P= 0.08). Conclusions Use of remifentanil was not associated with a reduction in ICU or hospital mortality, nor with good neurologicaloutcome. However, there was a trend to increased ventilator-freeand ICU-free days. This effect needs to be confirmed prospectivelywith a larger dataset. Caution must be exercised regarding theeffect of delayed sedative drug metabolism on neurologicalassessment in patients who have undergone therapeutichypothermia, especially drugs metabolised by the on CYP2E1 chlorzoxazone-medi-ated metabolism in a cardiac arrest rat model.

P401 Positive inotropic effects of midazolam anaesthesia in rats transthoracic echocardiography (TTE)are easier, more time sparing and much more animal friendly in theassessment of the left ventricular (LV) function in rats comparedwith the techniques used in the past. Where the aim of previousstudies was to determine the cardiac function under differentanaesthetics in an extracorporeal model, the aim of our study is tofind the ideal anaesthetic for the assessment of the cardiacfunction in the rat.Methods Two different studies were performed using pinhole gated SPECT and TTE in male Wistar rats. For the TTE study 32rats were randomised to four groups and were anaesthetized withtwo different products with a washout period of 3 days. A linearprobe was used for assessing M-mode images and LV volumes(ml) were calculated using an ellipsoid the pinholegated SPECT study, 48 rats were scanned two times with a1-week interval: once under pentobarbital (60 mg/kg intraperito-neally) anesthesia for the control study, and a second time usingthe same anesthetics as the TTE study. Pinhole gated SPECT wasperformed 1 hour after intravenous injection of 330 MBq 99mTc- MIBI. Parameters of cardiac function were derived usingquantitative gated SPECT.Results Augmented ejection fractions were observed for midazolam compared with all other anaesthetics (85% in the SPECT study and91% in the TTE study). Anterior wall thickening was remarkablyaugmented: 84 \u00b1 9% compared pentobarbital 64 \u00b1 23 ( P = 0.03) in the TTE study, but no difference was observed in the inferior thickening. In the SPECTstudy, augmented wall thickening was observed in the lateral, inferior,septal and anterior region (all P<0.001) compared with pentobarbital. Conclusions Anaesthetic agents seem to play a role in regional contractile function, affecting global LV function. Previous studiesdemonstrate conflicting results concerning the effect of midazolamon cardiac function. Both of our studies suggest that, at the givendose, midazolam has a positive inotropic effect. P402 Comparison of cerebral hemodynamic variables in JL Introduction has been described as having a positive cerebral hemodynamic effect by reducing the cerebralblood flow/cerebral metabolic index ratio (CBF/CMI ratio) andimproving CFB self-regulation; however, no data are available onhow this actually modifies brain metabolism.Methods We performed a multicenter, prospective, randomized, active comparator (dexmedetomidine-propofol or dexmedeto-midine-midazolam) study. We included consecutive adult patients(>18 years old) admitted to ICUs with hemorrhagic stroke andmoderate or severe brain edema (measured directly at surgery orby CT scan) who needed sedation for at least 72 hours afterrandomization. We excluded patients with mild brain edema,contraindications to the use of sedatives and those who could nothave a jugular venous line placed. Randomized groups receivedsedation + midazolam (Group 1) or dex-medetomidine + propofol (Group 2). We obtained basal measure-ment of several variables indirectly related to 2saturation - SvjO2, jugular cerebral extraction - CEO2, estimated cerebral metabolic rate - ECMRO2) and repeated these measurements after 72 hours. Statistical analysis was performedusing chi-square and proportions for categorical variables, and themedian, standard deviation and Student t test for continuous variables. We considered P 0.05 significant. Results Twenty-eight consecutive patients were included (15 male), average age 61.2 \u00b1 8.6 years, presenting with moderatebrain severe brain edema (23/28,82.1%). Both randomized groups had 14 patients. We found nodifference between groups in SvjO 2(P = 0.49 basal, P = 0.19 at 72 hours), Da-vjO2(P = 0.68 basal, P = 0.67 at 72 hours), CEO2 (P = 0.49 basal, P = 0.19 at 72 hours), or ECMRO2(P = 0.34 basal, P = 0.50 at 72 hours). Conclusions No significant differences in the measured brain metabolism variables were found among the two groups. Wesuggest comparing these two groups versus a placebo group inanother study.Reference1.

Methods Twenty-four abdominal open surgery patients were included in a double-blind, randomized study. After extubation a PCA pump with T was placed to promote optimal analgesia. In the first group K was added (0.5 mg/ml) to the pump (Gk, n= 6), in the second group it was MgSO4(0.03 mg/ml) (Gm, n= 6), in the third group MgSO4was adjunct to K (Gm-k, n= 6) and in the last group NaCl 0.9% was added and served as the control group (Gc, n= 6). Consumption of T and the cognition (using the Mini-Mental State of Examination (MMSE) [1]) were evaluated at the end of hospitalisation in the ICU. For statistical analysis, a Shapiro-Wilk test, Wilcox text and Student t test were used. Results K and MgSO4, separately added to T, did not improve significantly its global consumption, demonstrating comparable postoperative pain scales between groups ( P = 0.08). MgSO4 coupled with K (Gm-k) improved postoperative pain compared with Gc ( P <0.05). This combination reduced the mean global T consumption by 15% (\u00b15% SD) during the first 24 hours and by 25% (\u00b18% SD) during the second day of pump infusion compared with the other groups ( P <0.02). K and MgSO4did not modify cognitive functioning compared with the control group (mean MMSE scoring: >28 \u00b1 2, SD) ( P = 0.1). Conclusions Adding a low dose of K or MgSO4to T in post- operative major abdominal surgery did not improve analgesia but the combination of both had a statistical sparing effect on T consumption. Magnesium plays a determinant role, by interacting in the glutaminergic pathways, on the K effect. Cognitive deter- minants in ICU patients are not modified by a low dose of K. Reference 1.

P404 Impact of ketamine on dynamic compliance and airway resistance of sedated and mechanically ventilated ICU patients E Elamin University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA Critical Care 2009, 13(Suppl 1): P404 (doi: 10.1186/cc7568) Introduction Little is known about potential hemodynamic benefits of continuous ketamine sedation and analgesia in adult ICU patients. Methods In a pilot multicenter, prospective, double-blind, randomized control trial, we screened 66 adult ICU patients who required sedation and analgesia. Patients meeting entry criteria were randomized to continuous infusion of ketamine (study) or fentanyl (control) for >24 hours to achieve a Ramsay Sedation Scale of 4. We recorded lung compliance and airway resistance. Sixty percent of patients (3/5) received ketamine with low-dose midazolam for 24 hours followed by midazolam only and 40% (2/5)received fentanyl. We measured dynamic compliance and airway resistance for both groups before sedative infusion and every 4 hours thereafter. Results There was a statistically significant increase in the dynamic compliance in the study group compared with the control group ( P <0.05). There was a statistically significant decrease in the airway resistance in the study group compared with the control group (Figure 1). Conclusions This preliminary report illustrates the possible value of ketamine for continuous ICU sedation and analgesia. P405 Etomidate versus ketamine for in ill patients: a multicenter randomized controlled P405 (doi: 10.1186/cc7569) Introduction Critically ill patients often require emergency intubation with administration of etomidate as the sedative agent. The use of etomidate has been challenged as it causes a reversible adrenal insufficiency probably leading to an increase in hospital morbidity. Methods In this prospective, randomized, controlled, single-blind trial, we assigned 234 patients to receive 0.3 mg/kg etomidate and 235 patients to receive 2 mg/kg ketamine for intubation. The primary endpoint was the maximum value of the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score (SOFAmax) during the first inhospital 3 days. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00440102.) Results The mean SOFAmaxscore between the two groups was not significantly different (10.3 \u00b1 3.7 for etomidate vs. 9.6 \u00b1 3.9 for ketamine; P = 0.056). There was no significant difference in 28- day mortality (81 (35%) deaths vs. 72 (31%) deaths, P = 0.36), the number of patients needing catecholamine (137 (59%) patients vs. 120 (51%) patients, P = 0.10), median (IQR) ventilator-free days (12 (0 to 25) days vs. 15 (0 to 26) days, P = 0.36) and median (IQR) hospital-free days (4 (0 to 22) days vs. 6 (0 to 23) days, P = 0.57). Adrenal insufficiency incidence was significantly higher in etomidate than ketamine group (86% vs. 48%, P<0.001). There was no significant difference between the two groups in intubation conditions. There was no significant difference in outcome between the etomidate and ketamine groups on prespecified subgroup analysis (trauma or sepsis patients).Critical Care March 2009 Vol 13 Suppl 1 29th International Symposium on Intensive Care and Emergency Medicine Figure 1 (abstract P404) S165Conclusions Our results do not provide evidence for contra- indicating etomidate during emergency intubation in critically ill patients. However, ketamine can constitute a good alternative. P406 Effect of clonidine on vomiting and diarrhea associated with ultra-rapid opioid detoxification: a randomized clinical trial H Farzam1, Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences, Kermanshah, Iran; 2School of Population Ultra-rapid opioid detoxification (UROD) as a new technique for abstinence is in progress. While diarrhea and vomiting are two frequent withdrawal symptoms, clonidine can effectively suppress such complications. This study aimed to investigate the effects of clonidine (oral) on diarrhea and vomiting during and after UROD. Methods A double-blind randomized clinical trial was conducted in Farabi Hospital in Kermanshah, in the west of Iran. We assigned 88 patients to three groups: C1 (0.2 mg) = 29, C2 (0.4 mg) = 29 and C3 (1 mg) = 30 patients. Clonidine was gavaged to patients after general anesthesia. After that, patients were monitored for diarrhea and vomiting during (4 to 5 hours) and after (12 hours) UROD. They were matched with respect to the type of drug abused and its route of administration. Results Three groups were comparable in terms of demographic characteristics and use of treatments except for use of different doses of propofol and midazolam. The most commonly misused drug was crack (19.3%). While there was no statistically differ- ences between three groups in terms of development of diarrhea during UROD, the greater proportion of patients in group C1 (31.0%) developed diarrhea after UROD ( P= 0.001). Three groups were comparable in terms of developing vomiting either during or after UROD. Compared with group C2 (1,248 \u00b1 226.4) \u00b1 232.3), (1,336.2 \u00b1 248.9) with midazolam ( P= 0.04). Conclusions Consistent with some other reports [1], this study showed that the use of larger dose of clonidine can effectively decrease the incidence of diarrhea after UROD. It can also decrease the need for larger doses of hypnotic and sedative drugs. Reference 1. Ma H, et al.: The effect of clonidine on gastrointestinal side effects ultra-rapid of intravenous in the critically ill patient NG Hunfeld, DJ Touw, PH Melief HAGA ziekenhuis, P407 (doi: 10.1186/cc7571) Introduction Paracetamol (PCM) is a drug with analgesic and antipyretic properties. Despite its frequent use, little is known about its efficacy and pharmacokinetics (PK) when intravenously administered in the critically ill patient. A previous study suggests that therapeutic concentrations are not always reached [1]. The primary aim of this open-label, multiple-dose study was to evaluate intravenous PCM therapy in critically ill, secondary aim was to study the PK of intravenous PCM.Methods Ventilated patients needing PCM treatment according to our ICU protocol (1 g PCM intravenously four times daily) were eligible for inclusion. Excluded were those with severe liver failure and those treated with PCM on the time of admission to the ICU. Blood samples were collected at 0, 30, 60, 180 and 300 minutes after the first and, if possible, the fifth and 21st doses. A computerized model was used to estimate population PK. Results Nineteen patients were included of which 13 were male, with a mean APACHE IV score of 94.8. No antipyretic effect could be measured in any of the patients. PK parameters have been calculated for all patients after the first PCM dose. The half-life was 2.2 hours, the volume of distribution was 1.03 l/kg, and the clearance was 0.33 l/kg/hour. Data from 15 patients could be analysed after the fifth dose and from five patients after the 21st dose. The PK of intravenous PCM in our population show a biphasic profile (Figure 1). One hour after the dose, the mean serum concentration level was below the therapeutic level. In 18 out of 19 patients serum concentration dropped below 5 mg/ml before the next dose, resulting in a lack of build-up of a suitable therapeutic level of PCM after multiple dosages. Conclusions The recommended dose of 1 g intravenous PCM four times daily is not sufficient to achieve a therapeutic effect in critically ill patients. This can be explained by the low serum levels reached. These results warrant the development of an adequate dosing scheme for intravenous PCM followed by a large clinical trial studying the effects and safety of this regimen in critically ill patients.

Theoutcome measure of delirium was included with those of cardiacand respiratory eventsResults Of the 403 noncardiac surgical patients, 50 were cared for in the ICU and 353 were cared for in a high-intensity bed or asurgical ward bed postoperatively. Delirium occurred in 10 (20%)patients admitted into the ICU versus 15 (4.2%) of those admittedto the surgical wards ( P <0.001). Independent predictors of developing delirium included the patient's age, the PRFI, andassignment to the ICU a priori . The RCRI was not an independent predictor of delirium. (See Table 1.)Conclusions In a cohort of patients undergoing high-risk noncardiac surgery, age, PRFI, and assignment to the ICU a priori predicted the development of delirium. P410 Risk factors for intensive care delirium B Van Rompaey, M Elseviers, L (doi: 10.1186/cc7574) Introduction Delirium is a common complication in the ICU. The attention of researchers has shifted from the treatment to theprevention of the syndrome, necessitating the study of associatedrisk factors.Methods In a multicenter study of one university hospital, two community hospitals and one private hospital, newly admitted adultpatients were included when reaching a Glasgow coma scalegreater than 10. Nurse researchers assessed the patients fordelirium using the NEECHAM confusion scale. Risk factors weresplit into four groups: patient characteristics, chronic pathology,acute illness and environmental factors. Odds ratios werecalculated using univariate binary logistic regression.Results A total population of 508 patients was screened for delirium. The 36 studied factors showed some variability accordingto the participating hospitals. The overall delirium incidence was29%. For patient characteristics, age was not a significant factor.Intensive smoking (OR = 2.04) and living singly at home (OR =1.94), however, contributed to the development of delirium. In thegroup of chronic pathology, a pre-existing cognitive impairmentseemed important as a risk factor (OR = 2.41). In the group offactors related to acute illness, the use of drains, tubes andcatheters, acute illness scores, the use of psychoactivemedication, a complete sedation or coma and a preceding periodof mechanical ventilation showed significant ORs ranging from1.04 to 13.66. Environmental risk factors were noise, induced by ahigh number of alarms (OR = 5.37), isolation (OR = 3.81), theabsence of visit (OR = 2.83), the absence of visible daylight (OR =1.80), a bed in a shared ICU room (OR = 1.70), a transfer fromanother ward or hospital (OR = 3.01) and admittance through theemergency room (OR = 2.19).Conclusions The present multicenter study indicated four groups of risk factors for delirium in the ICU. Particularly among thoserelated to the acute illness and the environment, several factors aresuitable for preventive action. P411 Delirium assessment in ICU patients: a comparison study AJ Slooter, MM Van Eijk, IA Klijn, N De Wit, J Kesecioglu, RJ (doi: 10.1186/cc7575) Introduction Delirium is a frequent problem in the ICU and is associated with a poor prognosis. Delirium in the ICU seems to beunderdiagnosed by nursing and medical staff. Several detectionmethods have been developed for use in ICU patients. The aim ofthis study was to compare the value of three detection methods(the Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU (CAM-ICU), theIntensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist (ICDSC) and theimpression of the ICU physician) with the diagnosis of apsychiatrist, neurologist or geriatrician.Methods All patients were eligible for inclusion. We excluded deeply sedated patients (Ramsay score greater than 4), comatosepatients (Glasgow coma score less than 8), patients in whom noinformed consent was obtained, patients who did not speak orunderstand Dutch or English, or patients who were deaf. Deliriumevaluations were performed by different investigators indepen-dently and blinded to each other assessments. The CAM-ICU wasused by a trained ICU nurse, the ICDSC was administered byanother ICU nurse, the ICU physician was asked whether a patientwas delirious or not. Further, a psychiatrist, geriatrician, or neuro-logist serving as reference rater diagnosed delirium using DSM-IVcriteria, based on all available information.Results During an 8-month period, 126 patients (mean age 62.4, SD 15.0; mean APACHE II score 20.9, SD 7.5) admitted to a 32-bed mixed medical and surgical ICU were studied. The CAM-ICUshowed higher sensitivity and negative predictive value (64% and83%) than the ICDSC (43% and 75%). The value (95% and 82% vs. 88%and 72%). The sensitivity of the physicians view was only 29%,with 96% specificity, 75% positive predictive value and 74%negative predictive value.Conclusions The present study shows that the impression of intensive care physicians is not sensitive enough to identifydelirium. In this investigation in a mixed ICU population, the CAM-ICU had a higher sensitivity than the Delirium assessment in intensive care unit patients: a comparison study. Crit Care Med 2009, in press. P412 Effect of magnesium on the incidence of delirium occurrence in the ICU F Esen, E Senturk, P \u00d6zcan, Introduction Sedation agents and opioids present an important subgroup of medications known to promote delirium. This studywas designed to test the hypothesis that intravenous magnesiumadministration reduces the incidence of delirium occurrence byCritical Care March 2009 Vol 13 Suppl 1 29th International Symposium on Intensive Care and Emergency Medicine Table 1 (abstract P409) Standard Characteristic Odds ratio 95% CI error P value Intercept 0.00047 PRFI 1.04 1.00 to 1.09 0.02 0.036Age, per year 1.06 1.01 to 1.12 0.024 0.011ICU bed allocated 1.80 1.07 to 3.01 0.26 0.027S167causing less sedative consumption in a mixed population of ICU patients.Methods Sixty-three adult medical and surgical ICU patients requiring mechanical ventilation were randomized to receivemagnesium (2 g bolus intravenously, continued by 16 g/day infusion,target range 1.0 to or saline. Patients sedatedwith remifentanil and midazolam titrated to achieve the desiredlevel of sedation measured by the Richmond Agitation andSedation Scale (RASS). Those patients achieving a RASS scoreof \u00b11 or 0 were monitored daily for delirium using the ConfusionAssessment Method for the ICU (CAM-ICU). The incidence ofdelirium, delirium duration, daily remifentanil and midazolam con-sumption were compared between groups. Statistical performancewas compared using Mann-Whitney U and chi-square tests.Results The groups were comparable in terms of age, gender, and admission APACHE II (17.2 \u00b1 5 vs. 18.5 \u00b1 8) and SequentialOrgan Failure Assessment (4.9 \u00b1 2 vs. 5.6 \u00b1 3) scores. Theincidence of at least one episode of delirium occurrence was 25%in the magnesium group and 27.3% in the control group. Themagnesium group achieved the desired level of sedation of RASSscore \u00b11.0 much earlier than the control group and spent moretime within that level of RASS score (68% vs. 36%) Addition ofmagnesium resulted in more days without delirium (89% vs. 55%).There was a reduction in the daily remifentanil and midazolamconsumption in the magnesium group.Conclusions This is a preliminary report of an ongoing study. Our results demonstrated that addition of magnesium to the sedationprotocol lowers both the remifentanil and midazolam consumptionand resulted in more days without delirium in a mixed population ofICU patients. P413 Memory dysfunction after brain traumatic injury depends on the Marshall score but not on the duration of sedation: preliminary findings A Di Filippo, ML Migliaccio, C Gonnelli, Zagli, M P413 (doi: 10.1186/cc7577) Introduction The aim of the study was to identify the causes of memory dysfunction after brain traumatic injury. Recently, a lightanaesthesia, more than a deep anaesthesia, has been accused ofcausing postoperative cognitive dysfunction [1]. Conversely, thedaily sedative interruption in ICU patients does not result inadverse mental outcome [2]. Patients affected by brain injury canhave severe memory dysfunction after discharge [3].Methods One hundred and twenty-one patients were admitted to an emergency department ICU in 2007 with major trauma (injuryseverity score >15) and severe to moderate brain injury (Glasgowcoma scale <13). Of these patients, 25 died in the days followingtrauma. Thirty-four of them - submitted, during the ICU stay, toseveral lengths of sedation (17.2 \u00b1 9.2 days; range 1 to 40) -were evaluated at the follow-up visit 6 months after discharge fromthe ICU. As a part of neurological evaluation, verbal and visuo-spatial memory tests were administered to the patients to obtain adiagnosis of memory dysfunction. During the ICU stay, from theICU database (FileMaker Pro 5.5v2; FileMaker, Inc., Santa Clara,CA, USA) with authorization of the Careggi Teaching HospitalCommittee of the Emergency Department, the following para-meters were collected for every patient: age, sex, abbreviated injuryscale, injury severity score, Simplified Acute Physiology Score II, inthe field Glasgow coma scale, Marshall score, worst values oflactates and ScvO 2within 24 hours from trauma, length ofsedation and ICU stay. The median of each collected parameter in the group of patients was used as the cutoff value to divide theminto two categories: risk factor for memory dysfunction present orabsent. A two-by-two analysis was carried out and Fisher's exacttest was used for comparisons. P<0.05 was considered significant. Results Memory dysfunction was observed in 15 out of 34 patients. Only Marshall score >2 (8/15 vs. 3/19; P<0.05) represented a significant risk factor for memory dysfunction.Conclusions In brain traumatic injury patients the extent of brain damage, qualified by the Marshall score, is related to late memorydysfunction regardless of the length of sedation and the severity ofthe initial clinical picture.References1.

This study wasundertaken to determine the COX-2 and E-selectin expression inthe lung tissue in the swine model during an acute normovolemichemodilution (ANH) procedure with hydroxyethyl starch (HES130/0,4), normal saline solution (NS) or gelatin (GEL).Methods Twenty-eight pigs were anesthetized, instrumented and randomized into four groups: control, ANH + HES, ANH + NS andANH + GEL. Animals in the ANH group were submitted to ANH toa target hematocrit of 15% with volume replacement performedwith HES and GEL at a 1:1 ratio and NS at a 3:1 ratio. Thewithdrawn blood was returned to the animals 120 minutes after theend of hemodilution. After euthanasia, the chest cavity was openedand the lobes of the lung were removed and fixed in 10%formaldehyde solution. After the histopathological assessment, thelungs were prepared with antibody anti-COX-2 and E-selectin. Thepathologist, who was blinded to the experimental protocol, scoredthe expression of COX-2 and E-selectin by semiquantitativelyevaluating the intensity (absent - 0, weak - 1, moderate - 2 andstrong - 3) and incidence (absent - 0, 10% - 1, 10 to 50% - 2,50 to 75% - 3 and 75 to 100% - 4) of positively stained endo-thelium of the interstitial pulmonary microvasculature. The totalindex was obtained from the sum of the frequency and the intensityscores. For the immunohistochemistry score, a nonparametricFisher's test was used.Results The intravascular leukocytes expression of COX-2 in the NS group was weak and differed significantly only from the GELgroup ( P <0.05). In contrast, groups HES and GEL showed a moderate and strong COX-2 expression, respectively, which wasdifferent from the control group ( P <0.05, P <0.001, respectively).Available online http://ccforum.com/supplements/13/S1S168E-selectin expression in the HES and GEL groups differed significantly from the control. In the HES and GEL groups, a weak to moderate expression of E-selectin ( P <0.05, P <0.001) was detected in endothelial cells from pulmonary arteries and veins. Conclusions Fluid replacement during ANH increased inflamma- tion determined by an increase in COX-2 and E-selectin expression. P415 Influence of hematocrit detection methodology on transfusion practice M B\u00e9chir, JF Stover, M Bosshart, R Stocker 1): P415 (doi: 10.1186/cc7579) Introduction Transfusions of allogeneic red blood cells (RBC) are associated with viral and bacterial infections, activation of inflammatory pathways, transfusion-related acute lung injury and transfusion-associated circulatory overload. To reduce and prevent such harmful consequences, a clear indication for transfusion of RBC is required. However, our clinical experience shows that the method of assessing hematocrit is of crucial importance when implementing a strict trigger-dependent transfusion practice with the aim of preventing unnecessary transfusions, especially in non- bleeding critically ill patients. The aims of the present study were therefore to compare two different hematocrit-assessing methods used in clinical routine and to determine whether the results obtained by these two methods would influence our RBC transfusion management. Methods A total of 50 patients treated on our ICU for at least 5 days in which daily blood counts including hematocrit analysis were performed were investigated (250 paired samples). Hematocrit was analyzed using our blood gas analyzer (ABLflex 800) located on our ICU and the routine method used by the central laboratory (ADVIA\u00ae2120). Post hoc , patients were grouped according to the predefined transfusion triggers (24% and 28%) used on our surgical ICUs for different illnesses. Results Bland-Altman analysis for repeated measurements showed a good correlation with a bias of +1.39% and two standard deviations were \u00b1 3.12%. The 24% hematocrit group (n= 30) showed a correlation of r2= 0.87 and the kappa was 0.56; that is, 22.7% of the cases would have been differently transfused. In the 28% hematocrit group ( n= 20) there was a correlation of r2= 0.8 and the kappa was 0.58; that is, 21% of the cases would have been differently transfused. Conclusions Despite a good agreement between the two methods with which hematocrit is determined in clinical routine, the calculated difference of 1.4% will substantially influence trans- fusion practice, resulting in erroneous RBC transfusion in approxi- mately 21% of our patients. This, in turn, could endanger these patients. Consequently, the transfusion trigger used in clinical routine is strongly dependent on the used method of analysis and must be taken into account. P416 Effect of correction of anemia in severe congestive heart failure H Michalopoulou1, J Vaitsis1, S Massias2, P Stamatis2 1'Metaxa' Hospital, Athens, 2009, 13(Suppl 1): P416 (doi: 10.1186/cc7580) Introduction Anemia is common in patients with heart failure, and the combination of erythopoietin and intravenous iron has beenshown to improve their clinical status. We investigated the effect of correction of anemia on cardiac function in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) with just intravenous iron. Methods Sixty-four patients with severe CHF (NYHA III or IV), a left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) 35% despite maximally tolerated doses of CHF medication and whose hemoglobin levels (Hb) were <12 gr% were randomized into two equal groups: treatment group ( n= 32) receiving iron sucrox complex (200 mg weekly for 6 weeks), and control group ( n= 32) receiving saline. Patients did not receive erythopoietin throughout the study. Results See Figure 1. Conclusions Correction of anemia may be an important addition to the treatment of CHF. Intravenous iron is a simple therapy that increases Hb, reduces symptoms and improves EF in anemic patients with CHF. P417 Effect of length of storage of red blood cell units on outcome in critically ill children O Karam1, M Tucci1, ST Bateman2, Children's Medical Center, Hartford, CT, USA; 4Children's Critical Care 2009, 13(Suppl 1): P417 (doi: 10.1186/cc7581) Introduction Transfusion is a common treatment in the pediatric ICU (PICU). No study has evaluated the clinical effect of length of storage of red blood cell (RBC) units in children. We undertook an analysis of a large PICU transfusion database to assess any effect of RBC length of storage on clinical outcome in children admitted to a PICU. Methods A prospective, observational study conducted in 30 North American PICUs between September 2004 and March 2005 [1]. Data collected on consecutive patients aged <18 years with a PICU stay >48 hours included length of storage (days) for transfused RBC units, daily severity of illness score (multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS)), PICU length of stay, and 28-day mortality. Data were analyzed in transfused patients with recorded length of storage according to the oldest RBC unit length of storage per patient. The primary outcome measure was develop-Critical Care March 2009 Vol 13 Suppl 1 29th International Symposium on Intensive Care and Emergency Medicine Figure 1 (abstract P416) S169ment of new or progressive MODS after transfusion. The secondary outcomes analyzed were 28-day mortality and PICUlength of stay. Odds ratios were adjusted for age, number ofMODS at admission and total number of transfusions using amultiple logistic regression model.Results From a total of 977 enrolled children, 49% (475) were transfused with 2,146 transfusion events: 115 (24%) weretransfused once and 360 (76%) had multiple transfusions. Thelength of storage was recorded for 1,288 transfusions (60%) witha median length of storage of 14 days. The recorded length ofstorage for at least one RBC unit was known in 329 transfusedpatients (69%). For patients receiving blood older than the medianlength of storage (>14 days), the adjusted odds ratio fordevelopment of new or progressive MODS was 1.81 (95% CI =1.03 to 3.18, P <0.01). There were no significant differences in the total length of PICU stay (adjusted mean difference +0.04 days,95% CI -0.04 to +0.13) or mortality odds ratios (0.94, 95% CI =0.33 to 2.54).Conclusions In children admitted to the PICU, transfusion of RBC units stored for more than 14 days seems to be associated with asignificantly increased risk of MODS. Further studies are warrantedto ascertain the effect of RBC unit length of storage on outcome incritically ill children.Reference1.

P418 Pandemic triage: clipboard medicine or evidenced based? T Guest, G Tantam, K Tantam, L White, N Donlin, H McMillan, 1): P418 (doi: 10.1186/cc7582) Introduction The World Health Organisation states that it is not a case of if, but when, the next influenza pandemic strikes. In theevent of a pandemic, intensive care resources are predicted to beoverwhelmed [1]. One means of allocating and maintaining ICUsupport is the triage protocol developed by Christian andcolleagues [2] based on the Sequential Organ Failure Assessmentscore, comorbidity, and age. This study assesses the efficacy ofthe triage criteria on all patients admitted to our 28-bed ICU.Methods Data required to apply the triage protocol were collected for consecutive critical care admissions over a 60-day period.Triage categories were assigned as per the protocol and the out-come data were collected from the hospital patient data system.Results Of the 255 admissions, 190 were nonelective. Of these, the triage category was blue (that is, would have been refusedadmission to ICU) on admission for 32, and a further 29 who werenot (that is, were deemed appropriate ICU admissions by the triageprotocol) became blue by 48 hours. Of these 61 patients, 29 weredischarged from hospital alive. For our sample of emergencyadmissions, the sensitivity of the triage protocol for correctlyidentifying patients at admission who survive to hospital dischargewas 0.87. The corresponding specificity was 0.27.Conclusions Thirty-two per cent of emergency admissions would have been denied critical care using the triage protocol, of which48% survived to hospital discharge. We conclude that the triagecriteria are not fit for purpose: they are neither sensitive norspecific enough to differentiate survivors from nonsurvivors, andwould still leave clinicians with too many patients for too few beds.References1.

P419 Do trauma patients on ventilators in the emergency department need multiple blood gas analysis to optimize treatment? MS Moeng Johannesburg Hospital, Houton, 13(Suppl P419 (doi: 10.1186/cc7583) Introduction The importance of adequate ventilatory support after severe trauma is highly stressed. However, this may lead to atendency to hyperventilate trauma patients [1] put on a ventilator inthe emergency department. The aim of this study was toinvestigate whether trauma patients on ventilator in the emergencydepartment are hyperventilated.Methods A prospective collection of data for trauma patients put on a ventilator in the emergency department. The questionnaireincluded demographic information, indication for ventilation,analysis on initial and repeat arterial blood gases, and managementchanges. Patients were recruited over a period of 6 months from 1November 2006 to 30 April 2007.Results Fifty-nine patients were identified, 54 (91.5%) were male and five (8.5%) were female. Age ranged from 4 to 60 years. Theindication for ventilator treatment was isolated head injury in 28(47.5%) patients, polytrauma in 13 (22%) patients, polytraumawith severe head injury in nine (15.3%) patients and isolatedairway and ventilation indication in the remaining nine (15.3%)patients. Thirty-seven patients had a Glasgow coma scale (GCS)of 3 to 8, 13 had GCS of 9 to 12, and nine patients had GCS of13 to 15. The first arterial blood gas was done within 10 minutes ofventilator treatment in 48 (81%) of the cases, whereas the secondwas done within 90 minutes in 41 (69.5%) of the cases. In 23(39%) patients, pCO 2was less than 30 mmHg on the first gas, and in 19 (32%) patients on the second gas. Oxygenation wasadequate with levels above 200 mmHg in 40 (68%) of initial and in47 (80%) of second gases. The most common ventilatory manipula-tion was a reduction in minute volume after the first gas in 14(24%). Reduction of inspiratory oxygen was the most commonchange after the second gas in 28 (47%). The number of cases thatshould have had ventilatory adjustment was reduced from 12 (20%)after the first arterial blood gas to one (1.7%) after the second.Conclusions Although there was a tendency to hyperventilate patients on ventilators in the emergency department in ourinstitution, satisfactory ventilation was achieved almost uniformlyafter the second blood gas analysis.Reference1.

P420 CT scans at outlying hospitals improve understanding of advanced trauma life support noncompliance D Mohan, AE Barnato, JE Bost, MR Rosengart, DC 2009, 13(Suppl 1): P420 (doi: 10.1186/cc7584) Introduction We investigated the incidence, determinants, and consequences of CT scans performed at outlying hospitals onAvailable online http://ccforum.com/supplements/13/S1S170patients who met the criteria for immediate transfer to a level I or II trauma center. Guidelines disseminated through advanced trauma life support (ATLS) facilitate the movement of patients to the appropriate level of care, contributing to a 25% reduction in mortality [1]. Acquisition of CT scans of severely injured patients at outlying nontrauma hospitals violates those guidelines. Methods We conducted a retrospective review of trauma patients transferred from outlying hospitals to UPMC Presbyterian Hospital between 1 January 2000 and 31 December 2007 who met criteria for immediate transfer to a level I trauma center ( n= 5,707). We used multivariable random-effect logistic regression to explore the association between pretransfer CT scanning and mortality. Secondary outcomes included medical costs attributable to duplicate CT scanning and the clinical outcomes of duration of ventilator dependence, ICU length of stay (LOS), and total LOS. Covariables included patient (age, race, gender, insurance, mecha- nism of injury, injury severity score (ISS)), provider (ATLS certifi- cation) and hospital (trauma level designation) characteristics. Results Of 3,219 patients who received scans prior to leaving the outlying hospital, 2,411 patients had their scans repeated. In our analysis, patients with age >80 years or with an ISS >16 had a higher odds of receiving a scan (OR = 2.23, 95% CI = 1.72 to 2.88; OR = 1.55, 95% CI = 1.31 to 1.83). Patients after a motorcycle collision, after a penetrating injury, or without insurance had a lower odds of receiving a CT scan (OR = 0.78, 95% CI = 0.63 to 0.96; OR = 0.15, 95% CI = 0.11 to 0.21; OR = 0.62, 95% CI = 0.53 to 0.73). Acquisition of CT scans prior to transfer did not improve mortality, ICU LOS, total LOS or duration of mechanical ventilation. Using the 2008 Medicare physician fee schedule allowance, we estimated that the duplication of scans resulted in a cost of $2,091,817. Conclusions Despite robust evidence supporting the immediate transfer of severely injured patients, over one-half of the cohort transferred to UPMC Presbyterian received a CT scan prior to their transfer. Performance of scans at outlying facilities increased costs but did not improve outcomes. Reference 1. MacKenzie E: A national evaluation of the effect of trauma center care on mortality.

P421 Blunt abdominal trauma in children: a score to predict the absence of organ injury O Karam1, O Sanchez2, B Wildhaber2, 13(Suppl 1): P421 (doi: 10.1186/cc7585) Introduction Blunt abdominal traumas (BAT) are frequent and potentially life-threatening events in children. The aim of this study was to evaluate the initial workup, and to design a score that would allow ruling out significant intra-abdominal organ injuries. Methods Data were collected prospectively from 147 consecutive patients admitted for BAT in a tertiary-care hospital, over a 30- month period. The statistical significance of various parameters (trauma mechanism, clinical examination, laboratory tests and ultrasound findings) was analyzed in relation to intra-abdominal injuries. To fix the cutoff limits for the various laboratory tests, we used receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. The items with the highest negative predictive value (NPV) were then selected, and their respective relative risk was computed. This was then integrated in a score (named Blunt Abdominal Trauma in Children (BATiC)), which was tested on our population.Results Among the 31 parameters evaluated, 10 differed significantly between the two groups: abdominal pain, signs of peritoneal irritation, hemodynamic instability, white cell and abdominal ultrasound. For the six laboratory examinations, cutoff limits were determined using the ROC curves: Based on their respective relative risks for abdominal organ injury, the following points were attributed for these items: abnormal abdominal Doppler ultrasound (4), abdominal pain (2), peritoneal irritation (2), hemodynamic instability (2), AST >60 IU/l (2), had a NPV of 97%, and included 67% of the studied population. Conclusions These results suggest that in hemodynamically stable patients with a normal abdominal Doppler ultrasound, and a BATiC score 7, intra-abdominal lesions are very unlikely, and systematic CT scan or hospital admission may be avoided. P422 Risk of infection to packed gauze in damage control surgery for patients with hemorrhagic shock: safe limit of duration of packing Y Moriwaki, M Iwashita, Y Tahara, S Matsuzaki, H Toyoda, T Kosuge, S Arata, N Harunari, N Suzuki Yokohama City University Medical Center, Yokohama, Japan Critical Care 2009, 13(Suppl 1): P422 (doi: 10.1186/cc7586) Introduction Damage control is one of the useful strategies for trauma patients with hemorrhagic shock and critically ill patients with septic shock. We often perform gauze packing for the first step of damage control (damage control surgery). We are anxious about infection of packed gauze, and some experts said that we should remove the packed gauze within 48 to 72 hours. However, there is no evidence concerning the relation between duration of packing and risk of infection of the packed gauze. The aim of this study is to clarify this relation.Critical Care March 2009 Vol 13 Suppl 1 29th International Symposium on Intensive Care and Emergency Medicine Figure 1 (abstract P422) Duration of packing and bacterial culture of packed gauze. S171Methods A prospective observational case-series study. We performed bacterial culture of the removed gauze in patients whounderwent gauze packing in damage control surgery and removalof the packed gauze. We examined the relation between theduration of packing and risk of infection of the packed gauze.Results Twenty-one patients were enrolled. The duration of packing ranged from 19 to 146 hours. Bacterial culture wasnegative in 52% of cases and positive in 48% of cases. Bacterialculture was positive in all cases in whom the duration of packingwas over 100 hours. The duration of packing was longer in positivebacterial culture cases than in negative (no statistical difference).More cases were positive in bacterial culture in cases withgastrointestinal perforation (GIP) than without GIP (no statisticaldifference). However, many cases with GIP were obligated tocontinued packing for a long duration. There was no relationbetween bacterial culture and preoperative and operative bleeding(Figure 1).Conclusions Gauze packing in damage control surgery is thought to be safe within 96 hours from the viewpoint of infection. Wecannot determine the relation between bacterial infection and GIP. P423 Comparison between open and open-vacuum-assisted closure treatment in the adjuvant treatment of the abdominal compartment syndrome A Nella1, A Di Filippo1, S Matano1, M Bonizzoli2, 13(Suppl 1): P423 (doi: 10.1186/cc7587) Introduction Abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) represents a potentially life-threatening condition in critically ill patients. Thecontrol of intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) plays a pivotal role inprevention/treatment of ACS. We compared the efficacy of twodifferent therapies - open and open-vacuum-assisted closure(open-VAC) treatment [1] - on resolution of intra-abdominalhypertension/prevention of ACS.Methods We prospectively analyzed data of 26 consecutive patients admitted to the ICU of our emergency department(Careggi Teaching Hospital, Florence) with sepsis from anabdominal source, hemorrhagic shock, and major trauma. Allpatients underwent laparotomic surgery before ICU admission withopen-VAC treatment. As a control group we retrospective analyzed17 patients admitted with the same diagnosis and treated withopen treatment. IAP was evaluated by measuring the urinarybladder pressure [2]. Patients' demographic and clinical charac-teristics, and laboratory parameters were collected from the ICUdatabase (FileMaker Pro 5.5v2; FileMaker, Inc., USA) withauthorization of the Careggi Teaching Hospital Committee of theEmergency Department. For each patient, data were collectedbefore the surgical treatment with a closed abdomen (T1), 6 hoursafter ICU admission (T6), after 24 hours (T24), 24 hours afterabdomen closing (T24C), and at monitoring suspension (TMS).Statistical analysis: Student's t test (* P <0.05). Data reported as the mean \u00b1 SD.Results The two groups were similar in demographic and clinical characteristics. The open-VAC group patients showed a signifi-cantly shorter length of stay the ICU (open: 20.58 \u00b1 15.97;VAC: 11.46 in a time-dependent manner in the open-VACgroup.Conclusions The present study suggests that the open-VAC could have more beneficial effects than the traditional opentechnique in the treatment of patients with intra-abdominalhypertension/ACS.References1.

We recorded the UGITB episodes of all admissions (6,245patients) from January 2001 to December 2007 excluding those inwhom the UGITB motivated the admission, or it occurred within thefirst 48 hours. UGITB was defined as: melena and or nasogastrictube bleed with or without anemia, or anemia with a concomitantlesion on G-scope. All patients were on UGITB prophylaxis.Demographic data, APACHE II score, previous medical history andrisk factors for the development of UGITB were recorded. Also theinformation regarding G-scope findings, type of treatment receivedand consequences of the episode were recorded.Results We included a total of 73 patients (1.17%), 46 male (63%). The average APACHE II score was 22 - global mortality of49%. The relative incidence distributed for age groups showsmore incidence in the 41 to 50 years group. Six patients were onoral anticoagulation (8.2%), 14 on platelet anti-aggregation(19.1%), and one patient on low molecular weight heparin (1.4%).There were 11 patients with chronic liver disease (15% and 3.3%of total admissions (TA), three with previous history of UGITB(4.1% and 1.93% TA), four with peptic ulcer disease (5.5% and1.16% TA) and two patients with inflammatory bowel disease(2.8%). We analyzed: organ failure, sepsis, coagulopathy andnutrition, and we found an important association of UGITB withsepsis, shock, organ failure and mechanical hematemesis/bleeding nasogastric ofthem (16.4%) required sclerosis, one patient (1.4%) a Sengs-taken-Blakemore tube, and two patients (2.8%) arteriography withembolization. Most of the episodes resolved spontaneously. Theoverall mortality was 49.3% (36 patients); 1.1% of deaths weredirectly related to the UGITB.Conclusions In our series UGITB is not a common entity, and the most frequent findings were ulcers and erosions. UGITB must beconsidered a new severity criterion because although it is neitherrelated with the typical predisposing factors nor age, in thesepatients we observed higher mortality than the expected for theirAPACHE II score.Available online http://ccforum.com/supplements/13/S1S172Reference 1. Vartic M, et intensive circulating factor modulates and after multiple trauma Mouktaroudi1, T Kanni1, 10.1186/cc7589) Introduction The advent of multiple trauma is accompanied by lymphopenia often due to apoptosis. This may be due to theexistence of a circulating factor modulating apoptosis. Thepresence of such a factor in the serum of patients was assessed.Methods Serum was sampled at standard time intervals from 21 patients bearing multiple injuries and admitted to the ICU.Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated fromfive healthy volunteers after gradient centrifugation over Ficoll.PBMCs were stimulated overnight in a 96-well plate with 0.1 mlsampled serum. The percentage of annexin-V +/PI-/CD4+cells and annexin-V+/PI-/CD14+cells were estimated by flow cytometry. Results were compared with those obtained after cell incubationwith serum of healthy volunteers.Results Median sampled on consecutive days afteradmission are shown in Table 1. Similar results for patients compli-cated with sepsis on the first day of its advent are also presented.

P426 Abstract withdrawn P427 Treatment with p-hydroxyphenylpyruvate in the absence of resuscitation extends survival in rats subjected to lethal blood loss A Cotoia, JV Gefter, RL Delude University 13(Suppl 1): P427 (doi: 10.1186/cc7591) Introduction We tested the treatment with an enone-containing compound, p-hydroxyphenylpyruvate (pHPP), thefirst intermediate in the tyrosine catabolism pathway, could ameliorate the survival time in rats subjected to profound hemor-rhagic shock (HS) in the absence of resuscitation. We based thishypothesis on the knowledge that ethyl pyruvate (EP) and relatedenone-containing compounds are protective in numerous in vitro and in vivo models of oxidant-mediated and cytokine-mediated cellular and organ injury.Methods We compared the anti-inflammatory effects of EP and pHPP using U373 cells exposed to IL-1 and RAW 264.7 cells exposed to lipopolysaccharide. Volume-controlled HS was initiatedby withdrawing 21.7 ml blood per kg body weight over 20 minutes,followed by an additional 14 ml/kg over 40 minutes. A continuousinfusion was delivered during the final 20 minutes of hemorrhage.Groups of six rats randomly received: (1) 2.8 ml saline per kg or4% of total estimated blood volume (EBV); (2) 2.8 ml/kg of 0.25nM pHPP; (3) ml/kg; or (6) DCA plus 0.25 nM pHPP in 2.8 ml/kg.Results Cell culture studies revealed that pHPP blocked expression of CD54 in U373 cells and blocked release of NO induction of inducible nitric oxide synthase at lower concentrations compared with EP. Wetherefore tested its efficacy in a profound hemorrhagic shockmodel. Rats in both groups receiving pHPP survived significantlylonger ( P <0.001) than rats receiving vehicle alone. All rats in the vehicle group were dead by 140 minutes. Five out of 12 animalstreated with pHPP survived longer than 4 hours and one ratsurvived for 455 minutes. Prompted by the recognition that pHPPis an endogenous metabolite converted to HGA in the tyrosinecatabolism pathway, we sought to determine whether treatmentwith HGA could extend survival in the same HS model. Thepercentage of treated rats that survived until 5 hours in groups 2 or4 was 33.3%. No statistical significance was observed among ratsin groups 2, 3, 4. In order to obtain additional information regardingthe mechanism responsible for the protective effects, weadministered an inhibitor of the tyrosine catabolism, dichloroaceticacid alone or in addition to pHPP. Accordingly, the data showedthat all rats in groups 5 or 6 died within 4 hours.Conclusions These findings show that administration of a nanomolar dose of pHPP markedly improves survival followinglethal HS. This improvement is very probably related to a directpharmacologic effect of pHPP on inflammation that is shared withEP and together with pHPP acting as an anaerobic carbon source.Infusion of drug in only 2% of the EBV strongly suggests that theseeffects are not related to resuscitation. P428 Guidelines-associated decrease in mortality with recombinant activated factor VII for refractory hemorrhage AS Schneider, P Voirol, M Perez, Recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa; Novoseven) is indicated for treatment of bleeding in hemophilic patients withantibodies against factor VIII or factor IX. Although not licensed oragreed for other indications, its use for refractory hemorrhage isincreasingly reported. We reviewed our experience with off-labeluse of rFVIIa in this indication.Methods We retrospectively reviewed all patients treated with rFVIIa from March 2004 to November 2008 in our hospital. Thoseincluded in a multicentric study ( n= 10) or treated within approvedCritical Care March 2009 Vol 13 Suppl 1 29th International Symposium on Intensive Care and Emergency MedicineS173(n= 3) or nonhemorrhage ( n= 4) indications were excluded. Initial use imposed constringent guidelines implementation. According to these, use of rFVIIa requires cross-checking for active correction of hypothermia, acidosis, and coagulation factors and consideration for any feasible haemostatic surgery or embolisation. Results Forty-two patients were included. Median age was 39 years and 60% were male. The underlying condition was trauma in 14% of cases and surgery-associated hemorrhage in 76%. Bleeding stopped in 79% of cases. Potentially associated thromboembolic complications were observed in five (11.9%) cases, only one being very probably linked to rFVIIa. The overall 30- day mortality was 40.5%. The initial experience was followed by a decline in the use of rFVIIa, and the release of guidelines followed by a continuous increase. We observed a progressive decline in the 30-day mortality rate, from 70% in the first 10 patients to 17% in the last 10 (Figure 1). The average number of blood transfusions before rFVIIa remained stable but the median rFVIIa doses decreased from 206 g/kg in the first 10 patients to 80 g/kg in the last 10. Conclusions Local guidelines release did not decrease the number of cases but seem to impact on when and to whom rFVIIa is administered. Their release, associated with increasing experi- ence, was associated with a striking lowering of mortality rate. P429 Recombinant activated factor VII: does it really save lives? U Edke Shaikh Khalifa Medical City, Abudhabi, United Critical 2009, 13(Suppl 1): P429 (doi: 10.1186/cc7593) Introduction At pharmacological doses, factor VII (rFVIIa) bypasses conventional steps in coagulation cascade and directly generates a thrombin burst on the activated platelets at the injury, leading to the generation of fully stabilized tight fibrin clot. Methods Using the experience of our institute and an Internet search. In one of the largest prospective, randomized, multicentric studies of rFVIIa, 301 patients with blunt/penetrating trauma were enrolled - of whom 277 patients at the end of study were analyzable. The trial included 399 patients, all diagnosed by CT scan within 3 hours of intracerebral hemorrhage onset. Patients were randomly assigned to receive placebo ( n= 96), 40 g/kg (n= ( n= 103) doses of rFVIIa within 1 hour of the baseline scan. The results of the Survival of Myocardial Infarction Long-Term Evaluation study (that is, thelargest controlled study showing the relationship between genetic polymorphisms and disease) demonstrated that propensity to high factor VII levels is not associated with a risk for myocardial infarction. Results One study has demonstrated that one single dose of rFVIIa (80 g/kg) could reduce transfusion requirements in cirrhotic patients undergoing orthotopic liver transplant. Compared with 29% growth in the placebo arm, intracerebral hemorrhage volume growth in the 40, 80, and 160 g/kg arms was 16%, 14%, and 11%, respectively (corresponding to a relative reduction of 45%, 52% and 62%). Conclusions Use of rFVIIa should be reserved for salvageable patients with coagulopathic bleeding that is unresponsive to existing medical therapies. Definitive surgical control of accessible sites of hemorrhage is nevertheless a necessary intervention. References 1.

P430 Recombinant activated factor VII for the treatment of bleeding in abdominal surgery and cardiac surgery G Michalska, R Stanek Clinical Hospital Nr1, 13(Suppl P430 (doi: 10.1186/cc7594) Introduction Recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa) plays a key role in hemostasis. The aim of this study was the clinical evaluation of the efficacy of rFVIIa in the treatment of bleeding during and after abdominal and cardiac surgery. Methods A meta-analyses of case-series studies ( n= 67) on the treatment of bleeding with rFVIIa regarding reduction or cessation of bleeding and mortality. We used the questioners of Novo Nordisk to assess the indications and effectiveness of treatment. We compared the amount of blood loss within 12 hours before and within 12 hours after giving rFVIIa, and the dynamics of bleeding. In 10 patients the bleeding started after surgery intraoperatively, in 57 patients severe hemorrhage developed in the postoperative period. We also compared the full blood count and laboratory coagulation profile parameters before treatment, and 2 and 12 hours after treatment. In cardiac surgery rFVIIa was administered 5 to 49 minutes after neutralization of heparin with protamine sulfate. The dosage of rFVIIa was 39.23 \u00b1 20.70 /kg We used Student's t test for statistical analysis. Results After administration of the first median dose (14.45 to 81.35 g/kg) of rFVIIa, bleeding stopped in 47 patients. Bleeding was markedly decreased in 15 patients. Five patients who did not benefit from initial rFVIIa administration received additional drug in a dose of 38.25 g/kg with good results. The average blood loss within 12 hours before treatment was 2,510.00 \u00b1 1,642.07 ml, and the average blood loss within 12 hours after treatment was 1,057.75 \u00b1 810.67 ml. The average dynamics of bleeding \u00b1 138.82 ml/hour, and 87.90 \u00b1 67.82 ml/hour after treatment. Transfusion requirements were reduced for packed red blood cells, fresh frozen plasma, platelets, and crystalloid and/or colloids. Reduction in transfusion requirements was statistically significant ( P 0.05). Conclusions The meta-analysis of case series showed that in a mean of 85% patients rFVIIa achieved at least a reduction of bleeding, reducing the need for hemotransfusions.Available online http://ccforum.com/supplements/13/S1 Figure 1 (abstract P428) Thirty-day mortality after rFVIIa. S174P431 Safety of activated recombinant factor VII in patients with circulatory assist devices AS Schneider, P Tozzi, P Voirol, P Schoettker, MH Perez, A Angelillo-Scherrer, J R J Cotting, L Recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa; Novoseven) is indicated for treatment of bleeding in hemophilic patients withantibodies against factor VIII or factor IX. Although not licensed oragreed for other use, it is increasingly reported for refractoryhemorrhage. Implantation of a circulatory assist device requirestight anticoagulation therapy and may be complicated by massivebleeding. We report our experience with off-label use of rFVIIa innine patients with circulatory assistance.Methods We retrospectively reviewed all patients treated with rFVIIa for massive bleeding secondary to anticoagulation duringcirculatory assistance between March 2004 and November 2008.rFVIIa use and dosage was decided according to local guidelineswhen available (released in May 2006). According to theseguidelines, systematic crosscheck for active correction of hypo-thermia, acidosis, and coagulation factors with parallel considera-tion for any feasible interventional embolisation or haemostaticsurgery are required for authorization of rFVIIa use.Results Nine patients with circulatory assistance received rFVIIa. Median patient age was 43 years (<1 to 55). Eight patientsunderwent cardiac surgery (including two heart transplants). Onehad a bipulmonary transplant. The device was an extracorporealmembrane oxygenator in seven patients and a ventricular assistdevice in two patients. Median rFVIIa dose was 100 g/kg (45 to 180), split into two or three injections in six cases. Bleeding controlwas obtained in five patients (60%). The mortality rate at 30 dayswas 40%, including two within 48 hours from failure to controlhemorrhage. We observed one thromboembolic complication(stroke) which may potentially be related to rFVIIa administration.Conclusions Our series suggests that the cautious use of rFVIIa may be an option in patients with a circulatory assist devicesuffering from massive hemorrhage refractory to conventionaltreatment. P432 Analysis of the off-licence use of recombinant activated factor VII for patients with uncontrolled haemorrhage in a UK tertiary referral hospital M Spivey, H Eve, M Duffy Derriford Hospital, Plymouth, UKCritical Care 2009, 13(Suppl 10.1186/cc7596) Introduction Recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa) is increasingly used for the treatment of acquired coagulopathiesassociated with uncontrolled haemorrhage. Consensus guidelines[1] have been published for the administration of rFVIIa in thissetting. We examined the off-licence use of rFVIIa in our 1,071-bedtertiary referral hospital.Methods Hospital blood-bank data were examined from the first off- licence use of rFVIIa in November 2002 until August 2008. Casenotes were reviewed on these patients to gain demographics,indications and dosage of rFVIIa. Pathology data were cross-referenced to gain results before and after administration of rFVIIa.Results Twenty-two patients were identified over the 6-year period who received off-licence rFVIIa. The majority of uses were incardiac surgery (nine patients), followed by general/vascular surgery (five patients), and trauma (four patients). Of thesepatients, 41% (nine patients) did not survive >24 hours. Meandosage was 7.8 mg (89.4 g/kg) and was given after mean transfusions of 24.8 units of packed red cells, 13 units of freshfrozen plasma, 3.5 units of pooled platelets and 2 units ofcryoprecipitate, in the preceding 24 hours. At this time, blood testsreveal a mean of 91 platelets (SD = 54.9), but nearly one-quarterof patients received the drug with a platelet count <50;prothrombin time 17.9 seconds, activated partial thromboplastintime 58.7 seconds, and pH 7.18. Mean temperature prior to rFVIIaadministration was 34.7\u00b0C. Full APACHE II data were available for64% of the patients with a mean of 18.3 (SD = 6.5), and for thetrauma patients a mean revised trauma score of 5.9. Following theadministration of rFVIIa, the mean prothrombin time reduced to13.4 seconds at 1 hour. Sixty-eight per cent of patients (15)received blood product transfusions in the immediate 24 hoursafter having rFVIIa with a mean of 2 units packed red cells, 3.2units fresh frozen plasma, 1.5 units pooled platelets and 1.1 unitscryoprecipitate.Conclusions In our establishment, off-licence use of rFVIIa has often been unsuccessful and may have been used as salvagetherapy. There is heterogeneity in prescribing rFVIIa and its usedoes not conform to European guidelines [1]. Controversycontinues about the merits of using off-licence rFVIIa at all [2].References1.

P433 Treatment of obstetric hemorrhage with recombinant activated factor P Czuprynski, G Massive postpartum bleeding remains a major cause of maternal morbidity and death. An estimated 90% of such deathsmight be preventable.Methods rFVIIa was used in our ICU in the treatment of 12 women with severe or life-threatening postpartum bleeding (PPB) in 2005to 2008 due to accrete, rupture of the uterus andpre-eclampsia with haemolysis, elevated liver enzymes and lowplatelets. The average patient age was 30 years. We used thequestioners of Novo Nordisk to assess the indications andeffectiveness of treatment. All patients had normal coagulationparameters before surgery. We compared the amount of bloodloss within 12 hours before and 12 hours after giving rFVIIa, thedynamics of bleeding (assessed in ml/hour) before and aftertreatment and coagulation profile parameters. We used smalldoses of rFVIIa (15.25 to 50 g/kg). We used Student's t test for statistical analysis of the laboratory data prior to and after rFVIIa.Results Indications for administration of rFVIIa were considered when sudden blood loss exceeded 1,800 ml or when continuingblood loss of 500 ml/hour (in the drain). Patients after rFVIIatreatment received a lower number of packed red cell transfusions(4.0 \u00b1 4.46 vs. 9.61 \u00b1 6.7, P = 0.007), compared with before treatment. In addition, the median amount of crystalloid/colloidsadministered decreased markedly. After administration, rFVIIaCritical Care March 2009 Vol 13 Suppl 1 29th International Symposium on Intensive Care and Emergency MedicineS175bleeding stopped in eight patients. Bleeding markedly decreased in two patients during 3 hours. Two patients who did not benefit from initial rFVIIa administration received additional drug in a dose of 35.65 g/kg with good results. No adverse effects were directly related to treatment with rFVIIa. Conclusions Clinical reports and hematologic data suggest improvement for more than 80% of women after rVIIa administration. P434 Thromboelastography versus viscoelastography for evaluation of coagulopathies in patients after abdominal surgery for cancer O Tarabrin, A Vladyka, S Shcherbakov, A Belyakov, A Petelkaki, A Budnyuk Odessa Medical University, Ukraine Critical Care 2009, 13(Suppl 1): P434 (doi: 10.1186/cc7598) Introduction The viscoelastography (VG) versus thromboelastography (TEG) for monitoring of peri- operative coagulation balance after abdominal surgery for cancer. Methods A complete coagulation screen, the activated clotting time (ACT), TEG and VG were performed before surgery and at the end of the operation, and monitoring of LMWH anticoagulation therapy on postoperative days 1, 2, 3, and 7. We tested the hypothesis that the parallel use of standard TEG and VG can fully access the postoperative state of blood coagulation. Results The elastic shear modulus of standard MA (Gt) and VGMVA (Gh), which reflect the total clot strength and pro- coagulatory protein component, was calculated. The difference was an estimate of the platelet component (Gp). There was a 14% increase of standard MA, corresponding to a 48% increase of Gt (P<0.05) and an 80 to 86% contribution of the calculated Gp to Gt. Using multiple linear regression, all coagulation, TEG and VG variables were used to model perioperative thrombophylia. The results showed that some components of TEG failed to identify hypercoagulation ( r<0.2, P<0.75). However, three components of the routine coagulation assay, including the bleeding time, prothrombin time and platelet count, could be modeled to show prolonged postoperative hypercoagulability ( P<0.01). We conclude that all components of the VG test reflect postoperative coagulopathies. Serial standard TEG and viscoelastic analysis may reveal the independent contribution of platelets and of procoagulatory proteins to clot strength. Conclusions These results suggest that viscoelastic techniques might be useful in the determining the coagulation status in cancer patients perioperatively. Hypercoagulability is not reflected completely by standard coagulation monitoring and TEG, and seems to be predominantly caused by increased platelet reactivity. Reference 1.

The current study evaluated the influence of factor VIII levels and interactions with gender on all-cause mortality in a large Austrian cohort. Methods A total of 11,203 individuals were included in this study. The median observation period was 5 years, covering a total of 46,000 person-years. The death rate was 17.1%. Results Compared with individuals within the reference category (FVIII:C <94%) hazard ratios gradually increased from 1.4 (95% CI = 1.1 to 1.8) in the 152 to 170% category (fifth decile) to finally 4.4 (95% CI = 3.5 to 5.5) in the >313% category (highest decile, all P<0.05). The association between FVIII:C levels and mortality remained essentially unchanged when considering noncancer mortality, all-cause vascular mortality or mortality due to ischemic heart disease. Compared with males, females with elevated FVIII:C had a worse outcome resulting in higher hazard ratios reaching 6.8 (95% CI = 4.6 to 9.9) within the highest decile compared with males (hazard ratio = 3.4, 95% CI = 2.6 to 4.5). Conclusions In our large patient cohort we are firstly able to demonstrate that FVIII:C plasma activity is strongly associated with all-cause mortality. Additionally, FVIII:C appears to interact with gender. Especially in women, FVIII:C might help identifying high- risk cohorts that might benefit from individualized prevention strategies. P436 Gel point and fractal microstructure of incipient blood clots are significant new markers of haemostasis P Evans1, K Hawkins1, R Morris2, 1): P436 (doi: 10.1186/cc7600) Introduction We have investigated the hypothesis that in whole blood the incipient clot formed at the gel point (GP) is characterised by a fractal microstructure [1,2] and that this couldAvailable online http://ccforum.com/supplements/13/S1 Figure 1 (abstract P436) S176be detected in healthy and anticoagulated blood. We compared the gel time (GT) required to form the incipient clot and thecorresponding fractal dimension ( d f) against laboratory markers of haemostasis and thromboelastography (TEG).Methods Blood samples were taken from 52 healthy adults and similarly 34 individuals whose blood had been anticoagulated withheparin over the therapeutic range.Results The incipient clot in normal blood is established as a sample-spanning network cluster at the GP [2]. The value of d fin whole healthy human blood is 1.74 (\u00b10.07), which indicates a highdegree of branching in the fibrin network at criticality and iscommensurate with that reported to arise in other biologicalsystems. There was a significant reduction in the value of d fand a corresponding prolongation in the GT in the heparin group ascompared with the healthy group (Figure 1).Conclusions We describe for the first time that the incipient clot formed at the GP of whole blood is characterised by a fractalmicrostructure. The values of d fand GT discriminate between clot structure in healthy and anticoagulated blood. The relationshipbetween these new markers may provide a basis for exploring therelationship between coagulation pathways and clot quality.References1.

P437 Acquired bleeding model induced by dilutional coagulopathy in the rabbit I Pragst, B traumatic or intraoperative blood loss necessitates massive transfusion. This blood loss and the dilutionof coagulation factors result in insufficient haemostasis. Treatmentsto enhance the haemostatic capacity need to be evaluated. Anacquired bleeding model due to a dilutional coagulopathy wasdeveloped in the rabbit to estimate the contribution PCC(Beriplex P/N; CSL Behring) on haemorrhage.Methods Rabbits were anesthetised were mandatorily ventilated. The animals were instrumented to monitorthe cardiovascular and respiratory system. Dilutional coagulopathywas induced by phased blood withdraw, salvaged erythrocyteretransfusion and volume substitution with hydroxyethyl starch.After the dilutional procedure the bleeding was inflicted by cuttingthe lateral kidney pole. To characterise the model, animals wereallocated to groups: I, sham operation (no dilution, (TGA), prothrombin time (PT) and the bleeding from the kidney woundwere assessed.Results Rabbits without a dilutional coagulopathy demonstrated rapid onset of haemostasis. Post-injury blood loss (BL) and time tohaemostasis (TH) were 4.7 \u00b1 2.4 ml and 4.4 \u00b1 1.1 minutes,respectively. After the dilution procedure coagulation factors werereduced to less 2.2 min).The TGA showed normal lag phase but only 50% of the normal peak thrombin level. The PT was prolonged after the dilution about1.8-fold. Using PCC treatment it was demonstrated that the peakthrombin level was corrected ( P <0.0001) and the BL (21.5 \u00b1 11.1 ml; P <0.01) as well as TH (12.4 \u00b1 1.4 min; P <0.01) were decreased significantly.Conclusions In this rabbit model of a dilutional coagulopathy it was demonstrated that a dilution of coagulation factors of morethan 50% affects TGA, PT and bleeding. Restoration ofcoagulation factors II, VII, IX and X using PCC corrects the TGAand reduces BL and TH. This model could be used to investigatenew drugs in dilutional coagulopathy.

APACHE scores were 19 \u00b1 4 (range 12 to 29).Forty percent underwent surgery before ICU admission ( n= 14). Upon inclusion, 34% ( n= 12) were receiving noradrenalin, blood pressures protocol resulted in aFXa levels within thetherapeutic range; peak levels were too high and trough levels toolow. The only significant difference between patients receiving/not-receiving noradrenalin was found in the trough levels of the SQ0.5 mg/kg protocol. Hemorrhagic/thorombotic complicationsincluded: one gastrointestinal bleeding (SQ 40 mg) and two distalinferior limb DVTs (SQ 0.5 mg/kg and intravenous 0.5 mg/kgprotocols). ICU length of stays averaged 9 \u00b1 6 days (median 8,range 4 to 33). Three patients died for causes seemingly unrelatedto the study (overwhelming fungal sepsis, severe pneumonia andmalignant reperfusion syndrome post carotid endarterectomy).Conclusions Current DVT prophylaxis protocols do not result in peak aFXa levels within the recommended antithrombotic range inCIPs. This suggests subtherapeutic levels of LMWH activity andshould lead to further studies on optimal dosing in these patients. P440 Effect of amniotic fluid on blood coagulation H Hayami, S Ohama, A Sakurai, J Yamada, O Yamaguchi, Y Koide, M OkudaYokohama City University Medical Yokohama, P440 (doi: 10.1186/cc7604) Introduction Amniotic fluid embolism (AFE) is a catastrophic complication of pregnancy. The incidence of AFE is very rare, andthe clinical presentation; central hemodynamic data in humans aretypically obtained more than 1 hour after the event and from onlythe subset of women who have survived the initial insult. Thismakes the exact pathophysiology remain elusive, despite numerous attempts at understanding AFE syndrome. We tried to evaluate theeffect of amniotic fluid on blood coagulation by making a simple in- vitro model, using an activated clotting time (ACT) monitor. Methods Sixteen healthy women undergoing elective cesarean section under spinal anesthesia. A venous sampling line wasinserted before induction of anesthesia. After artificial rupture ofthe membrane, amniotic fluid was carefully obtained by thesurgeon. At the same time, 10 ml venous blood was obtained fromthe sampling line, and two series of samples were made; (1) 5 mlvenous blood with 0.1 ml amniotic fluid (group 1), and (2) 5 mlvenous blood alone (group 2 = control). ACT was measured using2 ml sample in each group.Results The ACT was 66.5 \u00b1 20.9 seconds in Group 1 versus 102.4 \u00b1 15.8 seconds in Group 2 ( P <0.0001). Especially, there was one case that coagulated immediately after mixing theamniotic fluid and the ACT could not be obtained in Group 1(excluded from analysis). The strong coagulation ability by amnioticfluid was induced immediately, even in very small doses.Conclusions A dose of 0.1 ml was enough to form the 5 ml venous blood thrombosis, which is thought to be a sufficientamount to cause AFE, and we consider that its pathophysiologyresembles pulmonary embolism. We suggest that AFE may beinduced by a smaller dose such as 0.1 ml amniotic fluid than it hadbeen thought. A part of the mechanism of amniotic fluid embolismin humans can be explained by pulmonary embolism theory bymaking a simple in vitro AFE model. P441 Is it safe to thrombolyse patients with pulmonary embolism and right heart mobile thrombi? J Belohlavek, V Dytrych, A Kral, O Smid, A Linhart General Care 2009, 13(Suppl P441 (doi: 10.1186/cc7605) Introduction Right heart mobile thrombi (RHMT) are not frequent in patients with acute pulmonary embolism (APE); however, bear asignificant risk of APE recurrence and hemodynamic compromise.Immediate therapy is recommended, but the optimal approach isconsidered to be controversial in the absence of controlled trials [1].Methods We report an analysis of 21 out of 209 (10%) consecutive patients with echocardiographically diagnosed RHMTmanaged at our institution during the past 5 years.

P442 Argatroban for heparin-induced thrombocytopenia therapy in ICU patients with sepsis or multiple organ dysfunction syndrome B Saugel, W Huber, RM Schmid Klinikum prothrombotic, immune-mediated adverse reaction triggered byheparin therapy. When HIT is diagnosed or suspected, heparinsshould be discontinued and an alternative, fast-acting, parenteral,nonheparin anticoagulation such as argatroban should be initiated.The recommended initial dose of argatroban in HIT is 2 g/kg/ minute with following adjustment to the activated partial thrombo-plastin times (aPTTs). There are limited and inconsistent dataabout dosing of argatroban therapy in ICU patients with multipleorgan dysfunction syndrome [1,2].Methods Evaluation of 11 patients with sepsis or multiorgan dys- function syndrome treated with argatroban to demonstrate dosingadjustment difficulties of argatroban in critically ill ICU patients.Results Eleven ICU patients with sepsis or multiple organ dysfunction syndrome were treated with argatroban for suspectedHIT ( n= 11; mean thrombocyte starting dose of 0.46 g/kg/minute (min 0.04; max 0.56) to achieve aPTTs >60 seconds or aPTTs of 1.5 to threetimes the baseline aPTT. In 10 patients (91%), desired levels ofanticoagulation were achieved. Adjustment to aPTT required dosereduction in five patients (45%). Patients were treated for a meanof 4 days. The final mean dose in these critically ill ICU patientswas 0.33, about one-sixth of the usually recommended dose,probably reflecting the degree of illness and that there was atendency to target the lower end of the therapeutic aPTT range.Conclusions Patients with multiple organ dysfunction syndrome and HIT can be effectively treated using argatroban. In critically illpatients, the dosing of argatroban has to be adjusted. In all patientswith multiorgan failure syndrome a decrease in the initial dosage ismandatory. Further studies are needed to fully elucidate argatrobanelimination and dosage adjustments for intensive care patients.References1.

Thisstudy was aimed to develop an educational program for ICUphysicians to increase DVT prevention.Methods This study has been developed in two steps. By the retrospective one we assessed DVT incidence in patients admittedfrom December 2004 to December 2005 who were 18 years old and had been in the ICU longer than 72 hours. Exclusion criteriawere DVT within the previous 6 months, thrombophilic profile, andhigh haemorrhagic risk. After this period all ICU physicians weretrained to perform compression ultrasonography (CUS) for DVTscreening; moreover, a DVT risk scoring form was introduced intothe clinical practice. In the prospective phase we enrolled patientsreferred to the ICU from January 2007 to March 2008: inclusionand exclusion criteria were the same as the retrospective step. ICUphysicians assessed the DVT risk, scoring daily for each patient, soas to prescribe the best DVT prophylaxis, and CUS screening wasperformed twice a week. Then we compared the two steps of thestudy.Results During the prospective step we observed an increase in prophylaxis prescription: elastic stockings administration increasedfrom 42.80% to 64.00% ( P <0.000) and the use pneumatic compression devices increased from 3.17% to 4.90% ( P = NS); low molecular weight heparin (U/kg) prescription did not changeover the study periods. In the prospective phase the DVT incidencein the ICU was 4.5%, significantly lower than the 10.31% observedin the retrospective step ( P <0.05). This reduction was obtained in spite of the increase in the number of CUS screening for DVT:from 1.94 P <0.014). Conclusions ICU physician involvement in DVT risk management can be achieved through a training program to practice CUSscreening and introduction of a DVT risk scoring form into theclinical practice. In our ICU these interventions were associatedwith a significant reduction in DVT incidence. P444 Prothrombotic state at hospital discharge increases 1-year mortality in pneumonia and sepsis survivors FB Mayr1, S Yende1, JA Kellum1, of Pittsburgh, PA, USA; 2Washington University School of Medicine, St Louis, MO, 2009, 13(Suppl pulmonary embolism, are more common after respiratoryinfections, but underlying mechanisms are unclear. We hypo-thesized that the imbalance between procoagulant and fibrinolyticresponse during community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) persists athospital discharge and increases the risk of 1-year mortality.Methods We conducted a 1-year follow-up of 893 hospital survivors of the GenIMS study, an observational cohort of subjectswith CAP. We measured coagulation and fibrinolysis markers(antithrombin (AT), thrombin-antithrombin (TAT) complexes, factorCritical Care March 2009 Vol 13 Suppl 1 29th International Symposium on Intensive Care and Emergency MedicineS179IX, D-dimer, and plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1)) at hospital discharge. We used a Gray's model to estimate time-varying hazard ratios of death over 1 year, and the National DeathIndex to determine all-cause and case-specific mortality.Results Geometric means of factor IX and AT activities, TAT, PAI-1, and D-dimer levels were 117.8%, 91.6%, 3.6 respectively. Although majority ofpatients (88.4%) had clinically recovered at hospital discharge,coagulation markers were frequently abnormal. D-dimer, TAT andPAI-1 levels were abnormal in 80%, 40% and 11% of patients.Subjects with higher TAT, D-dimer, and PAI-1 levels were morelikely to die over 1 year, even after adjusting for patientdemographics, comorbidities, and severity of illness. Risk of deathwas highest initially and decreased over time (for each log-unitincrease the range of adjusted hazard ratios were 1.39 to 1.01(P= 0.01), 1.48 to 1.03 ( P = 0.004), and 1.50 to 0.76 ( P= for TAT, D-dimer, and PAI-1, respectively). The adjusted hazardratios remained unchanged when analyses were limited to subjectsdischarged home, or stratified by severe sepsis occurrence. Mostsubjects died due to cardiovascular disease (27.8%) and cancer(29.9%). Chronic lower respiratory tract infection (14.6%),infection (10.4%), renal failure (7.6%), and other causes (9.7%)accounted for the remaining deaths.Conclusions A prothrombotic state at hospital discharge is asso- ciated with increased 1-year mortality in CAP survivors. Pharma-cologic interventions targeted to reduce coagulation abnormalitiesafter acute infection should be investigated to improve long-termoutcomes.Acknowledgement FBM was supported by T32 HL007820-10. P445 Thromboembolic risk factors and thromboprophylaxis Mexico FJ Perez-Rada, JM Cerda-Arteaga, E Villanueva-Guzman, VM Sanchez-Nava, E Fernandez-RangelHospital important cause of morbimortality of critically ill patients, whomfrequently have several VTD risk factors but lack the appropriatepreventive measures. We conducted a study to identify the VTDrisk factors, prevalence and use of prophylaxis in our ICU.Methods We conducted a prospective, observational study of all patients admitted to the adult ICU of our hospital in a 4-monthperiod. We documented epidemiological data, VTD risk factors,and use of thromboprophylaxis. We used a risk scale that stratifiedpatients in one of four levels of thromboembolic risk (low,intermediate, high, and very high) according to the number of VTDrisk factors present. Daily clinical screenings for pulmonary orperipheral venous thromboembolism (VTE) were performed.Patients were contacted 30 days after discharge from the ICU toassess for any post-ICU VTE events.Results Two hundred and eighteen consecutive patients were included (134 males) with an average age of 61 \u00b1 18.6 years. Theaverage length of stay at the ICU was 5.7 \u00b1 12.9 days. The mostfrequent risk factors were age >60 years (83%), obesity (41%),smoking (33%), recent major anddiabetes A total of 51.4% (112/218) of the patients hadfive or more VTD risk factors (very-high-risk category), while 34%(74/218) had three to four VTD risk factors (high-risk category).Less than 50% of the patients received any thromboprophylaxis.Most of those that had VTD prophylaxis used mechanical devices(96/218; heparins suchas 38%). Twelve patients developed an identifiable event: six male patients developed VTEwhile in the ICU; two of them developed massive pulmonaryembolism and died. On follow-up assessment we contacted 183patients and identified six that developed clinical data of a new,nonsevere VTE event after ICU discharge. All 12 patients whodeveloped VTE had five or more VTD risk factors, locating them inthe very-high-risk category.Conclusions Most of the patients admitted to our ICU had several risk factors that predisposed them to VTE events. In spite of that, lessthan one-half of our patients received VTD prophylaxis. VTE deve-loped only in patients who had five or more risk factors. We suggestperforming regular VTE assessments in this group of et Chest impairs, but Ringer's acetate enhances, coagulation capacity dose dependently after cardiac surgery A Schramko, R Suojaranta-Ylinen, A Kuitunen, S Kukkonen, P Raivio, T 1): P446 (doi: 10.1186/cc7610) Introduction All colloid solutions have negative effects on blood coagulation, but these effects are dependent on the dose and typeof fluid administered [1,2]. Since cardiopulmonary bypassincreases the risk of postoperative bleeding, we examined to whatextent various doses of rapidly degradable hydroxyethyl starch(HES) or gelatin, in comparison with Ringer's acetate, impairedwhole blood coagulation after cardiac surgery.Methods Forty-five patients received three relatively rapid boluses (each 7 of either 6% HES ( n= 15) in a randomized, blinded fashion after elective on-pump cardiac surgery to maintain optimalintravascular volume. The study solution was continued as aninfusion (7 ml/kg) for the following 12 hours. The total cumulativedose of the study solution was 28 ml/kg. If signs of hypovolemiawere observed, Ringer's acetate was given. Blood coagulation wasassessed by thromboelastometry (ROTEM).Results Clot formation time was prolonged, and the alpha-angle as well as maximum clot firmness (MCF) decreased similarly afterinfusion of 7 ml/kg both colloid solutions ( P <0.05). These ROTEM parameters, indicative of delayed clot formation and impaired clotstrength, still deteriorated after the cumulative doses of 14 ml/kgand 21 ml/kg colloids ( P <0.05). In contrast, after of 14 ml/kg and 21 ml/kg Ringer's acetate MCF increased slightly butsignificantly. Some signs of disturbed coagulation were seen in thegelatin group on the first postoperative morning: MCF and the angle were still decreased in comparison with the Ringer group(P<0.05). Signs of excessive fibrinolysis were not observed. Chest tube output was comparable between all groups. No clinicalthromboses were observed.Conclusions HES (130/0.4) 7 ml/kg or gelatin impaired clot formation and firmness shortly after cardiac surgery. This effectbecame more pronounced as the dose increased. Ringer's acetateincreased blood coagulation capacity slightly.References1.

The duration and severity of such metabolic acidosisappear to depend on many factors, and the acidosis may continuefor hours after the initial intervention. It is unknown whetherdifferent types of fluids may affect such changes differently.Ringerfundin is a recently developed crystalloid with similar proper-ties to human plasma, perhaps resulting in less electrolytic andacid-basic disorders. Accordingly, we conducted a randomizedcontrolled study of fluid resuscitation in a clinical oncologic ICU.The aim of this study was to determine the effects of resuscitationon patients' electrolyte concentrations and acid-base status.Methods Forty patients in the first hours after diagnosis of septic shock (early hours) were randomized to receive solutions of eitherRinger's lactate ( Ringerfundin ( n= 20) for fluid resus- citation. The amount of fluid needed to reach the goals of therapywas compared between groups. Also, bicarbonate, base excess,pH, chloride, sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, albumin,anion gap, SIDe, SIG and lactate were compared at baseline, 2hours after initial therapy, 6 hours after and 24 hours after.Results There were no differences in demographic, baseline characteristics, electrolytic and acid-basic status of the groupsbefore therapy. After randomization, bicarbonate and base excessincreased significantly at 2 hours and 6 hours in the Ringerfundingroup compared with Ringer's lactate group ( P <0.0001). Patients greaterincrease in serum chloride ( P <0.002) and a lower clearance of lactate after 2 hours, 6 hours and 24 hours ( P <0.002). There were no differences in amount of fluid needed, SIG, SIDe and anion gapbetween groups.Conclusions When comparing Ringer's lactate and Ringerfundin, the choice of resuscitation fluid is independent predictor ofacid-base status and serum electrolytes. Ringerfundin adminis-tration was associated andacid-basic pattern.References1. Bellomo Med 1999, 27:2296-2297. P448 Is Stewart's approach useful in evaluation of acid-base disorders in septic shock patients? J Mallat, D Michel, P Salaun, D Thevenin Care P448 (doi: 10.1186/cc7612) Introduction Disorders of acid-base equilibrium are common in critically ill patients. The Stewart approach has been found usefulin explaining these disorders, where conventional analysis wasdeficient. However, much uncertainty remains about the usefulnessand clinical meaning of this new approach. The aim of our studywas to compare the traditional method based on the analysis ofstandard base excess (SBE) and anion gap with the Stewartapproach based on the analysis of the independent variables in septic shock.Methods A prospective observational study with all patients admitted to the ICU of our hospital for septic shock betweenSeptember 2007 and July 2008. Na for albumin (AGc), Clcorrected for water excess/deficit (Clc), apparent and effectivestrong ion differences and strong ion gap (SIG) were calculated.Unmeasured anions were identified theStewart approach identified metabolic acidosis in 27 (87%)patients. The traditional approach failed to identify seven cases ofmetabolic acidosis (five patients considered normal and two havingan alkalosis).The inclusion of AGc in the traditional analysis basedon SBE resulted in a different clinical interpretation of acid-basestatus than the Stewart method in only two (6.4%) patients. TheStewart approach did not identify one patient with metabolicacidosis observed with the use of SBE and AGc. Hyperlactatemia(lactate >2 mmol/l) was present in 18 (58%) patients. SIG were elevated in 25 (81%) and 24 (77.4%) patients.Hypoalbuminemia was found in all patients. Patients with normalSBE and high SIG had lower Clc than patients with low SBE(103.1 \u00b1 2.3 vs. 108 \u00b1 3.6; P = 0.03). Albumin was not different between these two groups. The normal SBE found with high SIGwas almost completely explained by the alkalinizing effect ofhypochloremia. AGc and SIG showed a very good self-correlation(r 2= 0.708; P = 0.001). Thirteen patients died before day 28. All metabolic acid-base variables failed to predict outcome.Conclusions The Stewart approach and traditional method associating the AGc are clinically interchangeable in identifying theacid-base disorders in septic shock patients. Because of itssimplicity and very good correlation with the complex calculation ofSIG, AGc must be used in clinic practice. Critically ill patients maypresent high SIG with a normal value of SBE as a result ofassociated hypochloremic alkalosis. P449 Acidbase.org: online decision support in complex acid-base disorders using the Stewart approach P Elbers1, R Gatz2 1St Antonius Hospital, Nieuwegein, 10.1186/cc7613) Introduction The Stewart approach to acid-base management has evolved to be the method of choice [1]. While the quantitativeapproach and the traditional Henderson-Hasselbalch method donot mathematically exclude one another, the Stewart approach mayprovide better mechanistic insight in complex acid-base distur-bances. However, the approach is perceived as complex, requiringmany calculations. This is why we developed an online tool thatmay facilitate its use.Methods We programmed several scripts interacting with a MySQL database. Users may reach the application online [2] andmust enter acid-base and chemistry data. Cases can be savedanonymously for later review. A tool is provided to run hypotheticalscenarios by changing different physiological parameters. Theapplication was tested using historical data from the author'shospital and limited public use.Results The application has been online since January 2008 (Figure 1). Initial testing led to various improvements. Withoutadvertising, over 500 doctors worldwide have used the softwareCritical Care March 2009 Vol 13 Suppl 1 29th International Symposium on Intensive Care and Emergency MedicineS181generating a total of 15,000 page-views as of December 2008. Feedback by users is voluntary and indicates multiple changes in diagnostic and/or therapeutic strategies. Conclusions We have shown it is feasible to build an online software application that aids in the interpretation of complex acid-base disorders using the Stewart approach. In addition this tool enables the clinician to judge the impact of possible intervention using simulation. We will next set out to investigate the impact of exposure to this decision support tool on clinical patient management. References 1.Stewart's Textbook of Acid-Base ; 2009 [www.acidbase.org] 2.

The aim of this study was to isolate factors that may affect the severity of alkalosis, the prolongation of hospitalization and the final outcome in patients admitted to an ICU. Methods Data were collected retrospectively from the electronic database of the surgical ICU of Hippocration Hospital, Athens, Greece. Inclusion criteria were defined as patients that developed metabolic alkalosis (pH >7.45 and [HCO3-] >24) at a certain time during their hospitalization. Patients were divided into two groups; group I included those with 7.45 <pH 7.55 and group II those with pH >7.55. Statistical analysis was performed between groups with regard to gender, age, type of surgery, blood urea concentration, white blood cell count, hematocrit, APACHE II score, serum potassium concentration, creatinine levels, total bilirubin levels, the presence of sepsis criteria, the recurrence of the disorder, the need for mechanical ventilation, the total days of the disorder, the length of hospital stay, the post-admittance day when the maximum pH was recorded, the post-surgery day of maximum pH, the use and the quantity of furosemide adminis-tration, the use and quantity of dobutamine administration, the use of human albumin and the survival. Statistical analysis was performed with the use of chi-square for comparison of data. Results Data charts from 1999 to 2005 were reviewed. In total, 987 patients were admitted to the ICU in this time period. Of these, 239 (24.2%) patients developed metabolic alkalosis at a certain time in their course. Group I included 210 patients (87.9%) and group II included 29 patients (12.1%). From the parameters that were analyzed, statistical significance was observed between the two groups in the value of the blood urea concentration, in the amount of sepsis criteria that were present and in the development of recurrence. We did not observe a statistical difference between the groups in creatinine levels, in the furosemide quantity or in serum potassium concentration. Conclusions The severity of metabolic alkalosis is affected by renal function as expressed by blood urea concentration and the severity of sepsis-septic shock. Moreover, unlike what we expected, furosemide administration did not prove of importance in the development of the alkalosis in this study.

S182Methods This prospective observational study took place in a university-affiliated hospital in Porto Alegre, Brazil, during theperiod of February to May 2007. We recorded clinical data andacid-base variables from 175 patients at ICU admission.Results The evaluation according to Stewart's method would allow an additional diagnosis of metabolic disorder in 59 (33.7%)patients. Individually, none of the variables appear to be goodpredictors of hospital mortality. However, using the multivariatestepwise logistic regression, we had a model with good discrimi-nation containing the SOFA score, age, chloride and albumin (areaunder receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.80; 95% CI =0.73 to 0.87). See Figure 1.Conclusions The Stewart approach, compared with the traditional evaluation, allows identifying more patients with major acid-basedisturbances. Hypoalbuminemia and hyperchloremia wereassociated with mortality.References1.

P452 Buffer therapy in severe metabolic or mixed acidosis C Le Goff1, B Jung1, 10.1186/cc7616) Introduction The current literature does not support buffers in acidosis except when facing proven losses of bicarbonates [1].However, human studies are lacking and data are supported by in vitro or animal studies that showed the side effects of bicar- bonates. The aim of this study was firstly to describe the frequencyof buffering therapy in ICU and secondly to compare the outcomebetween patients treated by buffers (buffer group) or not(nonbuffer group).Methods A prospective, multiple-center, observational study. All patients presenting a severe metabolic or mixed acidosis (pH<7.20) were screened. Acidoketosis was secondarily excluded.The mechanism of acidosis was defined by classical analyses [2].At admission, Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS) II andSequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores, pH,bicarbonatemia, lactatemia, dialysis, mechanical ventilation andvasopressor use were recorded. At ICU discharge, lengths of stay,mechanical ventilation and mortality were recorded. Data arepresented as the medians and quartile ranges and compared withthe Mann-Whitney and Fisher's exact tests.Results One hundred and forty-six were included for analysis. The main diagnosis at admission was septic shock (36%) and cardiacarrest (12%). Ninety were not treated with buffers and 56 weretreated at day 0. Severity scores at admission (SOFA 10 (7 to 13)vs. 11 (9 to 13) and SAPS II 62 (50 to 81) vs. 71 (54 to 81)),frequency of vasopressors (86% vs. 93%), dialysis (17% vs. 93%) in the nonbuffer andbuffer groups, respectively, were not different. Bicarbonatemia wassignificantly lower in the buffer group than in the nonbuffer group(15 (10.3 to 18.0) vs. 13.4 (8.0 to 17.0); P <0.05). No significant difference was observed between groups for length of stay in theICU (5 (3 to 7) vs. 4 (2 to 8) days), length of mechanical ventilation(4 (2 to 5) vs. 3 (2 to 4) days) and mortality (58 vs. 59%) in the nonbuffer and buffer groups respectively.Conclusions In this multiple-center observational study, buffering practices was heterogeneous. Buffering therapy in severe acidosis(pH <7.20) does not seem to influence the ICU outcome. Furtherclinical studies should be performed to better define the impact ofbuffering therapy in selected patients in severe acidosis.References1.

P453 of hypophosphataemia in Glasgow Royal Infirmary ICU CJ 10.1186/cc7617) Introduction Hypophosphataemia is a common treatable problem in ICU, and is indicative of many pathophysiological processes thatoccur in critical illness. This audit's objective was to quantify theincidence, severity and timing of hypophosphataemia in the ICU.Namely, the incidence of hypophosphataemia on ICU admissionand the incidence that develops following admission.Methods A retrospective audit of data entered into the computerised medical record database (CareVue) from alladmissions between 27 April 2006 and 7 July 2008. The time,date and value of all serum phosphate concentrations wereanalysed. Abnormal phosphate concentrations were A total 689 out of 795 patients admitted during this period had a serum phosphate recorded. Table 1 presents theclassification of phosphate concentrations on admission to the ICUand the minimum reached during their ICU admission. Theincidence of hypophosphataemia on admission to GRI ICU is 10%,of which <1% is at a critical concentration. The incidence ofhypophosphataemia during the whole of the ICU stay rises to 42%.Five per cent of ICU admissions get critical hypophosphataemia atsome point during their ICU stay; 69% of these patients have anormal or high phosphate concentration on admission, 19% have alow admission phosphate and 13% are admitted with a criticallylow phosphate concentration.Conclusions Hypophosphataemia is common in ICU admissions. Most commonly it develops subsequent to admission to the ICUand reaches critical concentrations in 5% of ICU admissions. Thetiming of this fall in phosphate may indicate specificpathophysiological processes and merits further investigation.Critical Care March 2009 Vol 13 Suppl 1 29th International Symposium on Intensive Care and Emergency Medicine Table 1 (abstract P453) Phosphate concentrations in ICU admissions ( n= 689) Severity On admission ICU minimum Critical 4 32 Low 69 289Normal 364 311High 256 89S183P454 Hypernatraemia the neurointensive care unit. A typical, well-known syndromeassociated with acute brain disease is central diabetes insipidus(cDI). However, cDI is not a frequent reason of hypernatraemia inneurointensive care. There are other causes of hypernatraemia,most frequently osmotherapy by mannitol or renal failure [1]. Thepurpose of our study was to evaluate retrospectively all hyper-natraemias in patients with acute brain diseases admitted to ourneurologic-neurosurgical care unit (NNICU) over a period of5 years.Methods We analysed all patients with acute brain disease and serum sodium above 150 mmol/l. Firstly we diagnosed cDIaccording to serum and urine osmolality, hourly diuresis, renalfunction parameters response non-cDI. were There were 75 hypernatraemic patients (mean age 56.8 years; 41 male) with the following diagnoses: stroke 43,tumour 20, trauma 7, hydrocephalus 4 and epilepsy 1. The meanGlasgow coma scale (GCS) on onset of hypernatraemia was 12 \u00b13.4, the mean Glasgow outcome scale (GOS) upon dischargefrom the NNICU was 3.3 \u00b1 1.4. We found cDI only in eightpatients (altogether 15 days). We classified 59 patients as non-cDIhypernatraemia (163 days). The remaining patients were notevaluated because they had no serum osmolality measurements.Between the two groups there were no differences in GCS(P= 0.631), GOS ( P = P = but patients cDI had low urine osmolality ( P = 0.001). On the other hand, the non-cDI group received more antioedematic therapy ( P = 0.013) and diuretics (P= 0.019). In this group, mannitol was received in 48 (81.4%) patients and six (10.2%) had creatinine clearance below thereference range (range <1.15 ml/s).Conclusions In neurointensive care cDI is not the most common type of hypernatraemia. Most hypernatraemias are non-cDI due toanti-oedematic unit: is too high? Crit Care 2006, 21:163-172. P455 Impact of hypernatremia, hyponatremia and their comparison on ICU mortality M Mokhtari, M Kouchek, M Miri, R Goharani 10.1186/cc7619) Introduction Serum homeostasis is important in the critically ill patient [1-3]. We studied the effect of hypernatremia,hyponatremia and their comparison on ICU mortality in our patientpopulation.Methods We studied 274 patients hospitalized in a general ICU of a major teaching hospital in Tehran, Iran, cross-sectionally,between 2004 and 2006. Patients' biographical data, reasons foradmission, hyponatremia (sodium less than 135 mEq/l) and hypernatremia (sodium more than 145 mEq/l) during the ICU staywere recorded and their effects on mortality were assessed.Results The mortalities of patients with hyponatremia (34.33% versus 15.37% with OR = 5.69 and 95% from 2.87 to 11.30)and with hypernatremia (55.17% versus 17.78% with OR = 2.80and 95% CI from 1.43 to 5.49) were significantly higher thanpatients without it. The mean age of patients with sodiumimbalance was higher compared with those without it (hypo-natremia and hypernatremia 52.25 high mortality [4]. Patients with hypernatremia showed higher ICUmortality as compared with those with hyponatremia.References1.

P456 Hyponatremia is associated with increased mortality in patients with acute decompensated hear failure J Vaitsis1, H Michalopoulou1, C 10.1186/cc7620) Introduction Hyponatremia has been identified as a risk factor for increased morbidity and mortality in patients with chronic heartfailure (HF) but there are few data for its prevalence and clinicalimplication in patients with acute decompensated HF.Methods One hundred and eighty-two patients (142 male, age 72.1 \u00b1 11.6 years) presented as worsening HF, NYHA III IV,48% with ejection fraction 30%, 43% of ischemic etiology, were enrolled during the period from August 2007 to July 2008. In aretrospective analysis we investigated the relationship betweenhyponatremia and inhospital mortality, 60-day mortality and 60-dayrehospitalization. We divided the patients into three groupsaccording to their admission serum sodium. Group A, Na136 mEq/l. Group B, Na = 135 to 131 mEq/l. Group C, Na 130 mEq/l. Results Patients in Group C had a more severe heart failure, lower blood pressure, lower ejection fraction and increased mortality(6.4% in Group C vs. 3.4% in B vs. 1.8% in A, P <0.05 for inhospital mortality), (13.7% in Group C vs. 7.2% in B vs. 4.7% inA, P <0.05 for 60-day mortality), (39.3% in Group C vs. 29.1% in B vs. 27.2% in A, P <0.05 for rehospitalization). In multivariable analysis, either moderate hyponatremia (Group B) or severehyponatremia (Group C) still remained predictors of death. GroupAvailable online http://ccforum.com/supplements/13/S1S184B: hazard ratio = 1.72 95% CI = 1.40 to 2.17. Group C: hazard ratio = 2.88 95% CI = 1.97 to 3.1.Conclusions Our data confirm the independent prognostic value of hyponatremia, even moderate, in patients with acute decom-pensated HF. Serum sodium on admission is an importantpredictor of increased mortality and rehospitalization. P457 Abnormal liver function tests are associated with increased mortality in both cardiothoracic and general intensive care S Musa, M Cowan, S Thomson, P Collinson, G McAnulty, M Grounds, T RahmanSt 13(Suppl 1): P457 (doi: 10.1186/cc7621) Introduction The objective of this study was to identify differences in liver function tests (LFT) between patients admitted to a generalICU (GICU) and a cardiothoracic ICU (CTICU), and the effect onmortality. Liver dysfunction (LD) in critically ill patients is commonand is associated with increased mortality and prolonged ICU stay[1]. Patients undergoing cardiothoracic surgery are anecdotally atincreased risk of LD as a consequence of haemodynamicinstability.Methods A retrospective study of all first admissions to the CTICU and the GICU between 1 October 2006 and 31 March 2007 wasperformed. LFT were obtained from the Chemical PathologyDepartment. Patient demographics and mortality were establishedfrom the hospital electronic patient record.Results A total of 481 patients were admitted to the CTICU and 661 to the GICU. Compared with the GICU, patients admitted tothe CTICU were older (66.9 vs. 59.7 years, P <0.05), more likely to be male (71% vs. 58%, P <0.05) and more likely to survive (30- day mortality 8.5% vs. 22%; P <0.05). At the time of admission, albumin was <35 g/dl in 94% of patients and declined thereafter.Excluding albumin, LFT were entirely normal in 50% and 54% to the GICU and the CTICU. Abnormal LFT onadmission were associated with increased mortality (Table 1).Conclusions Abnormal LFT are common in critically ill patients on admission to the ICU. Patients with subtle LD on admission are atincreased risk of mortality in both groups. An abnormal bilirubin hasa greater impact in patients admitted to the CTICU than the GICU.Reference1.

It is characterized by a reduction of the pituitaryproduction of luteinizing hormone-follicle-stimulating hormone(LH-FSH) and consequently of the peripheral androgens; on thecontrary, the levels of estrogens are increased due to theenhanced activity of aromatase [1]. The objective of our study wasto evaluate the pattern of sexual hormone production to identify acorrect replacement therapy.Methods Thirteen men with chronic critical illness with a mean age of 70 years and a mean APACHE score of 18 have been enrolled.Patients with endocrinological pathologies or in therapy withhormones, cortisones or dopamine have been excluded. Theanalysis of the sexual endocrine function was determined on theseventh day of stay in the ICU, considering the mean of fournocturnal measurements of LH-FSH, androstenedione, dehydro-epiandrosterone sulfate, testosterone and estradiol.Results Only three patients showed a reduction of LH-FSH under normal levels, 10 patients had normal levels of LH-FSH. All 13patients had normal or elevated levels of androstendione, a pre-cursor of testosterone. Levels of testosterone and dehydro-epiandrosterone sulfate were decreased under normal levels in allpatients. Levels of estrogens were elevated above normal levels inall patients.Conclusions The present study shows that in the early phase of chronic critical illness the reduction of testosterone could onlypartially be determined by the decreased pituitary stimulation. Thenormal levels of androstenedione, a precursor of testosterone,suggest an impairment of the intracellular pathway of androgenproduction through an inhibition of the 17 -hydroxysteroido- dehydrogenase. Considering these results, an exogenousstimulation of testosterone production with LH-FSH secreta-gogues could be unisexual or not sufficient to rebalance thetestosterone levels [2]. Furthermore, the increased conversion ofperipheral androgens in estrogens mediated by aromatase isconfirmed in this study. The use of aromatase inhibitors could beconsidered as a therapeutic way to rebalance the hormone axes incritical illness.References1.

Modern ICU management must offer ahigh quality of coma patient care and should be constantly fightingfor cost-effective ways of providing that care.Methods The aim of this study was to compare the traditional bed- bathing method with the basinless bed-bathing method. The studyfocused on nurse satisfaction or acceptance, and the costs of twomethods. The study comprised 100 baths of coma patients: 50completed using the Comfort Bath \u00ae(a prepackaged disposable bed bath) and 50 completed using the traditional method. Inaddition, 30 nurses were recruited and interviewed about theirpreferences and opinions. The economic study type was cost-minimization and, in part, cost-effectiveness analysis.Results For skin softness, administration ease, and nurse satisfaction, there were statistical variations between the two setsof scores, in favour of the Comfort Bath \u00aemethod. Nurses expressed a clear and significant preference for the disposablebath, corroborating findings by other investigators [1]. The directcosts were: for the soap, water, laundry, equipment and labour, forthe time taken to perform the bed-bathing, for logistics anddepreciation. The overall cost was less for the disposable bath dueto savings in nurses' time and salary (Table 1). Table 1 (abstract P459) Costs of bath technology required Traditional bath Comfort Bath\u00ae Total bath costs 18.46 16.74 Savings 1.73 Conclusions The present study confirmed that Comfort Bath\u00ae, a one-step bed bath, is an economic and preferred alternative to thebasin of water. Considering the cost-minimization, the cost-effective use and the significant preference, this prepackageddisposable bed bath symbolizes a new concept in coma patienthygiene.Reference1.

P460 In critically ill patients, how often is their weight estimated and how accurate is that estimate? D Mathew, C Kirwan, D Dawson, B Philips St UKCritical Care 2009, 13(Suppl 1): P460 (doi: 10.1186/cc7624) Introduction Weight is frequently required to determine the dose of many medications and is important in quantifying treatmentssuch as haemofiltration and calorific requirement. We present thefindings of an audit to determine how frequently a patient's weightis estimated in one ICU and the results of a pilot study to deter- mine the accuracy of an estimated weight in the critically ill patient.Methods A prospective audit of 100 admissions to an ICU was undertaken over a 6-week period. Data were collected fromobservation charts and hospital notes. Following data analysis apilot study was undertaken to assess the accuracy of the estimatedweight of patients in the ICU. Urine bags and drains were emptiedbefore weighing and the same number of pillows and blankets wasensured on each bed. Due to a short loan period of scales, only 18patients could be weighed.Results Audit The median (IQR) patient weight was 75 kg (64 to 85). Ninety-four ICU observation charts had a weight recorded,and of these 38 (40.4%) were estimated. Sixteen out of 20 (80%)medical patients and 22/74 (29.7%) surgical patients had anestimated weight. Sixty-three per cent of patients had a recentaccurate weight recorded in the notes and only 43 (68.3%) hadthe same weight recorded on the ICU observation chart. Seventyper cent of patients required a weight for cardiac output monitoringand 54% for drug dose calculation. Pilot study The median (range) measured weight was 92 (66.8 to 137.4) kg. Twelve out of 18 hadan estimated weight on the ICU chart. The mean (precision) ofestimation was 10.1 (\u00b121.4) kg. Seven out of 12 (58%) had agreater than 10% difference between the estimated and trueweights. Of the six patients who had a recent accurate weightdocumented in the notes, the mean difference (precision) betweenthat and the true weight was 5.8 (\u00b14.0) kg. Two out of six (33%) hada greater than 10% difference between estimated and true weights.Conclusions A patient's weight is an important parameter in guiding therapy. A large proportion of ICU patients have their weightestimated. In some cases this is unnecessary as a recent weight canbe found in the notes. A more comprehensive study is required toassess the clinical impact of weight estimation on the ICU. P461 Alcohol misuse requiring admission to a tertiary referral ICU: resource implications D Trainor, L Martin, G Lavery Belfast HSC Trust & Faculty of Life and Health Sciences, Universityof Ulster, Belfast, UKCritical Care 2009, 13(Suppl 1): P461 (doi: 10.1186/cc7625) Introduction Alcohol misuse is associated with many conditions requiring ICU management [1]. In 2006/2007, 1.53% of allhospital admissions were related to alcohol misuse (regional audit).We conducted a prospective audit in a tertiary referral adult ICU toascertain the proportion of ICU capacity used for the treatment ofconditions related to alcohol misuse.Methods Patients admitted to a tertiary referral ICU between 1 November 2006 and 31 March 2007 were prospectively auditedwith the aim of identifying all cases in which the reason foradmission could be attributed to acute or chronic alcohol misuse.Blood alcohol levels, past history from the patient/relatives orprevious relevant clinical investigations and/or diagnoses werereviewed for evidence of acute or chronic alcohol misuse.Results Of 318 ICU admissions during the audit, 9.43% (30 admissions - 20 male/10 female) were judged to be due to eitheracute (19 of 30) or chronic (11 of 30) alcohol consumption. Themean patient age was 48.7 years (SD 14.1, range 25 to 74).Blood alcohol level on admission to hospital was available in 13patients (43%), the median value being 170 mg% (IQR = 66 to274). Seventeen patients (56.6%) were admitted following trauma,of whom 10 (33.3%), had brain injuries. The median length of stay(LOS) in the ICU was 10 days (IQR = 4 to 15) and the medianLOS in hospital was 22 days (IQR = 10 to 38). The ICU mortalityAvailable online http://ccforum.com/supplements/13/S1S186rate was 23.3% (seven out of 30) and hospital mortality was 30% (nine out of 30). During the audit period, a total of 2,567 ICU bed-days were available, of which 357 bed-days (13.9%) were used totreat this group of patients. The mean ICU occupancy during thisperiod was 95.6%.Conclusions Alcohol misuse was implicated in almost 10% of ICU admissions - over six times the equivalent rate for total hospitaladmissions. These admissions required approximately 14% of totalICU capacity at a time when occupancy was almost 100%.Intensive care is a finite and expensive hospital resource. Publichealth bodies should be informed of the proportion of that resourcerequired to treat alcohol-related illness and injury.Reference1.

P462 Systemic rheumatic diseases in the ICU P Vernikos, T Topalis, A Mega, A Tzifas, N Archontoulis, J P462 (doi: 10.1186/cc7626) Introduction Patients with systemic rheumatic diseases may be admitted to the ICU because of pulmonary, renal or multiple organdysfunction, caused by worsening of the rheumatic disease,infection or adverse effects of immunosuppressive drugs.Methods In a 3-year period, 14 patients (six males/eight females), 18 to 80 years old (average 56.78), with systemic rheumaticdiseases were admitted in the ICU. Four of them had rheumatoidarthritis, one systemic lupus erythematosus, three dermatopoly-myositis, one Sjogren's syndrome, two vasculitis, two systemicsclerosis and one psoriatic arthritis. Three of them were admittedto the ICU after major surgical operation, nine of them because ofrespiratory failure and the others because of coma and/or shock.The admission APACHE II score, chest X-ray, bronchial secretioncultures, and PaO 2/FiO2were recorded, as well as the broncho- alveolar lavage findings, when it was necessary, and the finaloutcome.Results Nine patients were admitted because of acute respiratory failure: APACHE II score ranged from 17 to 28, X-ray showeddiffuse alveolar infiltrates, PaO 2/FiO2ranged from 75 to 184, only two patients had positive cultures of bronchial secretions. Twopatients were admitted after major surgical operation, one afternecrotizing pancreatitis: APACHE II score ranged from 9 to 21,X-ray showed diffuse alveolar infiltrates with a cavity in one,PaO 2/FiO2>300, the bronchial secretions cultures were negative. One patient was admitted because of coma and one otherbecause of shock: APACHE II score was 25 and 32, respectively,X-ray without any acute process, PaO 2/FiO2was >200 and none of them had positive cultures of bronchial secretions. Broncho-alveolar lavage was performed on six patients: on the second dayfrom ICU admission in four patients, on the eighth day in onepatient and on the 21st day in one patient. The total mortality ratewas 50% (7/14).Conclusions Early bronchoalveolar lavage (during the first 48 hours from admission) could help in differential diagnosis between:exacerbation of rheumatic disease, infection, drug-inducedrespiratory failure, and alveolar hemorrhage.P463 Distances covered by ICU nurses during their shifts E Nahk, S FrolovaEast-Tallinn Central P463 (doi: 10.1186/cc7627) Introduction We monitored the distances covered by nurses during their work in the ICU. An automatic step counter was usedto estimate the distances.Methods Seventeen nurses were monitored during 102 hours in total. Eight of them were responsible for one ICU patient during themonitoring period and nine took care of two patients at the sametime.Results The mean distance covered was 0.9 (range 0.4 to 1.3) km/hour, resulting in a mean 10.7 km per 12-hour shift. Thedistance was significantly different according to the number ofpatients the nurse was responsible for. The nurses taking care oftwo patients walked significantly more compared with the nurseswith one patient (1.0 with range 0.9 to 1.3 compared with 0.7 withrange 0.4 to 1.1 km/hour, P = 0.027). During their shift the nurses walked a mean 12.3 km when taking care of two patients and8.9 km when working with only one ICU patient.Conclusions Nurses need to cover long distances during their everyday work. In some cases the walking distance may beexpected to reach 15 km during the 12-hour shift. Optimization ofthe working load and logistics to reduce the walking distancesshould be the goal. P464 ICU triage in terror-related mass casualty events Y Klein1, Klein2, K Peleg3 1Kaplan Medical P464 (doi: 10.1186/cc7628) Introduction Admitting patients to the ICU is one of the triage processes needed during mass casualty events (MCE). The highoccupancy of the ICU and the fact that it cannot be readilyevacuated make this process even more challenging [1,2]. Wecompared the triage to the ICU in terror-related MCE versus othertrauma in Israel.Methods A retrospective cohort study of all patients recorded in the Israeli National Trauma registry (ITR) that were injured in MCEsecondary to terrorist acts by explosions from 1 October 2000 to31 December 2005. Medical records of all patients hospitalized inthe ICU were retrieved and reviewed. Over-triage was defined as apatient that is discharged from the ICU within 24 hours ofadmission without any specific intervention besides monitoring.Under-triage was defined as an admission to the ICU more than24 hours after an admission to a different department.Results The ITR included 122,208 patients during the study period. A total of 1,272 patients (1.0%) were injured in terror-related MCE. Three hundred and sixty-five patients (28.7%) of and 9,093 patients (7.5%) the non-MCE groupwere admitted to the ICU. Eighty-one (6.4%) of the patients in theMCE group and 2,445 (2.0%) of the patients in the non-MCEgroup were admitted to the ICU and discharged within 24 hours(P<0.0001). A total of 3.3% of the patients in the MCE and 9.2% of the patients in the non-MCE group were admitted to the ICUmore than 24 hours after admission to another department.Patients that were over-triaged to the ICU during MCE hadsignificantly more injuries, and to more body regions, than thepatients that were over-triaged to the ICU due to non-MCE trauma.Critical Care March 2009 Vol 13 Suppl 1 29th International Symposium on Intensive Care and Emergency MedicineS187Conclusions Over-triage to the ICU is probably unavoidable in MCE. This fact and the increased injury severity, anticipated interror-related MCE, should lead the hospital to adopt a plan forexpansion of the ICU capabilities. A post-event ICU re-evaluationround and judicious patient discharge may reduce prolongedoveruse of ICU resources.References1.

P465 Outcome of weekend and afterhour admissions compared with weekday and daytime admissions in the ICU with onsite intensivist coverage M Hawari, M Shaaban, N Abouchala, K Maghrabi, M Hijazi, M KherallahKing Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Riyadh, SaudiArabiaCritical Care 2009, 13(Suppl 1): P465 (doi: 10.1186/cc7629) Introduction The objective of this study was to determine whether onsite intensivist coverage would improve the outcome of weekendand afterhour admissions in our ICU.Methods In a cohort study at a tertiary-care medical-surgical ICU staffed 24 hours/7 days by onsite consultant intensivists withpredominantly North American Critical Care Board certifications, weincluded all ICU admissions (January 2007 to February 2008) froma prospectively collected ICU database. Results were stratifiedbased on the time of the admission (daytime (8:00 to 17:00) orafterhour time (17:01 to 07:59)) and the day of the week (weekdayor weekend). Predicted mortality rates were calculated using anAPACHE IV prediction model. The primary outcome was hospitalmortality, and standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) were calculated.Results A total of 1,315 admissions were included in the study. Forty-eight percent of patients were admitted in daytime and 52%in afterhour time with average APACHE IV scores of 59.8 and 55,respectively ( P<0.01), the SMR for the daytime group was 0.86 (95% CI = 0.69 to 1.05, P= 0.15) compared with an SMR of the afterhour group of 0.98 (95% CI = 0.84 to 1.15, P= 0.83). Seventy-two percent of patients were admitted on a weekday and28% on weekends with average APACHE IV scores of 57.7 and58.7, respectively ( P= 0.52); there was no significant difference in mortality rates between the weekday and weekend groups (17.3%vs. 21.4, P= 0.09, with SMRs of 1.05 vs. 0.89). After adjustment for severity of illness it appears that there is a trend towards alower mortality rate for daytime and weekday admissions comparedwith afterhour and weekend admissions; however, there is nostatistical difference.Conclusions Our results indicate no difference in mortality rates for weekend and afterhour admissions to an ICU that is staffed byonsite certified intensivists. P466 Scottish audit of interhospital transfers of acutely ill adults J Bruce1, R Colquhoun2, G Smith1, M Fried1 1St Johns (doi: 10.1186/cc7630) Introduction The audit was commissioned by the Scottish Govern- ment Health Department to identify the number of acutely ill adultstransported between hospitals by the Scottish Ambulance Service (SAS). Currently interhospital transfer (IHT) of acutely ill adultsrequiring medical escorts is undertaken by the SAS Accident andEmergency (A&E) ambulances or by dedicated transport teams (forexample, Glasgow Shock Team and Emergency Medical RetrievalService).Methods The audit ran for 20 weeks. Patients over 16 years old who required intervention/vital signs monitoring during transfer orwho required a nursing or medical escort were defined as acutelyill. Audit forms were placed in every A&E ambulance.Results A total of 3,068 forms were received, with 2,396 audited. Twenty per cent were emergencies, 73% urgent and 7% planned.The median SAS journey times, patient and dedicated teamjourney times are presented in Table 1. The majority of IHTsoccurred for specialist management (65.9%) or specialistinvestigation (23%). A total of 820 IHTs were clinically escorted,including the Glasgow Shock Team ( n = 192) and the Emergency Medical Retrieval Service ( n = 13). Two hundred and forty-eight patients were ventilated (10.3%). Eighty-four (3.5%) IHTs requiredclinical intervention to correct clinical deterioration. An adverseevent occurred in 1.5% (22). One hundred and thirteen (18%)escorted IHTs by nondedicated transport teams had unsecuredmedical equipment (0.97%) in dedicated transportteams ( P = 0.004). Equipment failures occurred in 9/97(9.2%) ventilated transfers by nondedicated teams versus 1/156 (0.6%)by dedicated teams ( P = 0.001). The SAS executive information service data showed a total number of IHTs during the audit periodconveyed by A&E ambulances as 19,747 (18,343 adults). Thisapproximates to a total of 51,342 per annum (47,692 adults) or917 adults per week.Conclusions The most frequent reason for IHT is specialist management or investigation.

P467 Outcome and resource utilization following interhospital transfer of critically ill patients D Vandijck, S Oeyen, P Coucke, P Lafaire, D P467 (doi: 10.1186/cc7631) Introduction Patients who undergo transfer to the ICU of an academic referral centre represent a group of sicker patients withincreased risk for grim prognosis than those admitted directly.These patients' weight in terms of increased resource utilization is,however, less studied. This study aimed to compare the outcomeand resource consumption between directly admitted patients andthose transferred from a peripheral hospital to the ICU of a largetertiary-care referral centre.Available online http://ccforum.com/supplements/13/S1 Table 1 (abstract P466) 248 Median 00:28 Dedicated team n= 205 Median 03:05S188Methods A prospective observational cohort study was conducted. All consecutive patients admitted to the medical and surgical ICU from 15 September 2007 to 15 December 2007 were retained for analysis. Severity of illness by means of the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, length of stay (LOS), and outcomes were gathered per admission. Data are presented as numbers (%) or as mean \u00b1 standard deviation. All statistical tests were performed as appropriate. The level of significance was set at P<0.05. Results Crude comparison of directly admitted ( n= 500) versus transfer patients ( n= 85) revealed that transfer patients had signi- ficantly higher severity of illness as expressed by the admission, mean, and maximum SOFA score ( P= 0.042, P= 0.034, and P= score ( P= 0.422), respec- tively. Transfer patients necessitated higher resource consumption as defined by the need for mechanical ventilation ( P<0.001), vasopressor therapy ( P= 0.01), medical imaging (respectively, CT or MRI) ( P<0.001), urgent surgical intervention during their stay in the ICU ( P<0.001), sedative drugs ( P<0.001), and tracheostomy placement ( P<0.001) compared with directly admitted patients, whereas no significant differences were found regarding need for renal replacement therapy ( P= 0.47) and blood transfusion (P= 0.41), respectively. A significant increased ICU LOS (8.6 \u00b1 11.1 days vs. 4.9 \u00b1 7.4 days, P<0.01) was observed for trans- ferred patients, whereas no difference was found for hospital LOS (23.6 \u00b1 27.4 days vs. 24.5 \u00b1 25.7 days, P= 0.81). When comparing both groups, those transferred from other hospitals were found to have worse outcome as demonstrated by higher ICU and inhospital mortality rates (16.5% vs. 8.6%, P= 0.03, and 29.6% vs. 14.5%, P= 0.002). Even after adjustment for severity of illness, being transferred was found to be independently asso- ciated with higher inhospital mortality (OR = 2.84, 95% CI = 1.41 to 5.72) (receiver operating characteristic = 0.87, 95% CI 0.91, freedom, 8; P= 0.617). Conclusions Patients transferred to the ICU of a tertiary-care referral centre generally consume more resources and have worse outcome as compared with directly admitted patients. P468 Patient monitor and ventilation workstation alarming patterns during cardiac surgery F Schmid, MS Goepfert, S Diedrichs, AE Goetz, DA Reuter University Medical Center Critical Care 2009, 13(Suppl 1): P468 (doi: 10.1186/cc7632) Introduction For improvement of patient safety, monitors and ventilator workstations are equipped with alarms. However, alarms are only suggestive if they indicate critical variations in the patient's condition. Great numbers of false alarms can lead to a crying wolf phenomenon with consecutive ignored critical situations. The objective of this study was to characterize the patterns of alarming of a currently available patient vital sign monitor (Kappa XLT; Draeger) and an anesthetic workstation (Zeus; Draeger) during cardiac surgery. Methods A prospective, observational study including 25 consecutive elective cardiac surgery patients. In all patients a predefined alarm setting was used. During 25 surgical procedures, all incoming patient data and alarms from the monitor and the anesthetic workstation were digitally recorded. Additionally, the anesthesiological workplace was filmed from two different views to assess reaction to the alarms. All events of alarming were retro-spectively annotated. Alarms were categorized: valid/not valid, relevant/not relevant and medical reaction yes/no. Alarms were annotated as relevant if measurement was technically correct and showed a threshold violation. Alarms were relevant if there was a need for medical reaction. Results During 124 hours of recording, 9,460 alarms in 48 categories were registered. A total of 3,054 (32%) alarms were of technical origin or static alarms and were not considered. The remaining 6,406 alarms were further analyzed. In total, 1,954 alarms were not valid and not relevant. A total of 4,452 alarms were valid (69%), 1,742 of these were clinically relevant and induced a reaction of the physician, 1,773 were relevant without a reaction of the physician. About 65% of the considered alarms were threshold violations (48% blood pressure). Nine hundred and thirty-seven alarms were valid but not relevant. Conclusions Approximately 80% of the total 9,460 alarms had no therapeutic consequences. Thirty-one per cent of the considered alarms were annotated as not valid. Sixty-nine per cent of the considered alarms were valid alarms, separated into 39% relevant alarms, 21% nonrelevant alarms and 40% relevant alarms without reaction of the physician. The majority of the static alarms occurred during the use of the extracorporeal circulation. Implementation of procedure-specific settings and optimization in artefact or technical alarm detection could improve patient surveillance and safety. P469 Second-day discharge from the ICU after non-emergency cardiac surgery L Vanfleteren, P Vandeneynde, T Vu, G Van den Berghe, G Introduction To develop models discriminative for second- day discharge (SDD) after non-emergency cardiac surgery [1]. Methods We evaluated electronic medical records of 453 consecutive adult non-emergency cardiac surgery patients, from June 2006 to May 2007. The following variables were considered as inputs: (a) one-time characteristics: sex, age, weekday, BMI, duration of surgery, length of first day; (b) binary variables (yes/no): cardiopulmonary bypass, external pacing, midazolam, hemo- dynamic drugs; (c) continuous variables: pulmonary artery pressure, arterial blood pressure, heart rate, cardiac output, PaO2,Critical Care March 2009 Vol 13 Suppl 1 29th International Symposium on Intensive Care and Emergency Medicine Figure 1 (abstract P469) S189PaCO2, FiO2, creatinine; (d) categorical values: score, pain score, positiveend-expiratory pressure; (e) urine output, bloodloss, piritramide and propofol dosage; (f) percentage of time onmechanical ventilation. Variables associated with SDD in univariateanalysis were entered into six multivariate logistic regressionmodels. We calculated the area under the receiver patients (21.9%) were discharged on the second day. All models showed good discrimination (aROC =0.881 to 0.905) and calibration ( P>0.05) (Figure models: sex, age,weekday, hemodynamic drugs, systolic arterial blood pressure,heart rate, verbal Glasgow coma scale, urine output andpercentage of time on mechanical ventilation. Entering these nineterms into a combination model could improve discrimination(aROC = 0.933) but led to overfitting ( P= 0.0143). Conclusions An electronic medical record can be used to create risk prediction models after cardiac surgery. We derived nineparameters associated with SDD.Reference1.

P470 Audit on compliance with NICE Clinical Guideline 50 (NCG 50): 'Recognition of and response to acute illness in adults in hospital' E Denison Davies, S Coone, P Glynne, S Adam, J Down, G Bellingan, D HowellUniversity College London Hospitals 1): P470 (doi: 10.1186/cc7634) Introduction The clinical deterioration of patients is often heralded by a decline in physiological parameters by up to 24 hours [1].NICE clinical guideline 50 (NCG 50) was published in July 2007 -'Recognition of and response to acute illness in adults in hospital' -with the aim of improving the care of acutely ill patients. We under-took an audit to determine how our institution currently performed.Methods Case records were randomly collated documenting the management of 89 adult patients admitted to and discharged fromcritical care over a 2-month period. An audit tool was developed tocompare these cases against all 25 NCG 50 standards using 50complete and 39 incomplete datasets.Results One hundred per cent compliance with NCG 50 was achieved in 2/25 (8%) parameters - measurement of admissionheart rate and physiological observations 12 hourly. Furthermore, 8/25 (36%) achieved 94% compliance including blood pressuremeasurement, oxygenation, response to deterioration and a writtendischarge plan. However, 4/25 (16%) parameters had 50% compliance including documentation of routine observations andtheir recording frequency.Conclusions This audit has shown that compliance with NCG 50 standards is excellent in several key areas. In order to improvewhere standard adherence was suboptimal we have introduced anovel strategy to ensure that ward-based documentation of theobservation frequency is now mandatory, with specific guidelinesfor escalation dependent on the clinical scenario. We believe the results of this audit are likely to be applicable to otherorganisations and suggest that a similar action plan be consideredto ensure NCG 50 goals are achieved.Reference1.

P471 Unique rapid response system with emergency call using an inhospital whole paging system Y Moriwaki, M Iwashita, S Arata, N Harunari, Y Tahara, N SuzukiYokohama City Care 2009, 13(Suppl 1): P471 (doi: 10.1186/cc7635) Introduction The system of an inhospital rapid response team (RRT) is desired to be set up. Our hospital adopted a unique rapidresponse system (RRS) constructed with two different systems(organized and systematic system to activate RRT members, andnonorganized and nonsystematic system to gather doctors andnurses near the scene) with an inhospital whole paging system(doctor call (DC)). The object of this study is to clarify theusefulness and problems of our RRS.Methods We examined the records of 55 patients enrolled in our RRS for the past 2.5 years and evaluated the change of the deathrate in whole discharged patients before and after the establish-ment of the RRS. Our unique RRS is as follows. A hospital staffmember who finds a collapsed patient/visitor or a patient/visitorrequiring urgent medical support or another staff near the scenecalls the inhospital whole paging system (DC), which is announcedin all areas of the hospital. Staff of the Critical Care and EmergencyCenter (CCE Center) bring an automated extracorporeal defibril-lator and one bag prepared for the emergency crisis for oneperson. Other staff near the scene bring a monitor, oxygen,emergency cart and stretcher. We established an inhospitaleducational course for basic life support and basic resuscitationskill and a self-educating system using an e-learning system.Results The events mainly occurred in the diagnostic and treatment room, waiting area, examination room for blood samplingor X-ray examination in the outpatient department (55%) and in thelavatory (5%). They seldom occurred in the critical care area (2%).The reasons why bystanders decided to start up the RRS aresuspected cardiac arrest (13%), loss of consciousness (18%),witnessed falling down (31%), and lying down (16%). The meantime interval between the event and DC is 0.96 and that betweenthe event and responding staff arrival at the scene is 1.81 minutes,respectively. The definitive diagnoses were cardiopulmonary arrestin 15%, cardiac event in 5% and psychiatric in 27%. In ninecardiopulmonary arrest cases, 33% were identified as an indicationof resuscitation because of 'do not attempt resuscitation' duringactivity. The RRT managed 59% of the patients within 1.1 minutes.Both the hospital death rate per total discharged patients and thatexcepting patients treated in our CCE Center showed adecreasing tendency after official organization in the hospital as aregular system.Conclusions Our unique RRS is thought to work well. However, it needs to be helped by other doctors working nearer the scenethan the RRT.Available online http://ccforum.com/supplements/13/S1S190P472 Influence of medical emergency team call system introduction on critically ill patients M Pavlik, V Zvonicek, L Dadak, T Bartosik, V Sramek 1): P472 (doi: 10.1186/cc7636) Introduction Many patients admitted to hospital develop early signs of instability (such as tachycardia, hypotension, hypoxemia,and so on) before a critical event occurs [1]. Often those patientsare admitted to the ICU with significant delay after multiple organfailure has developed. Different systems of early detection ofunstable patients have been designed, one of them called themedical emergency team (MET) call system. The efficacy ofsystems is still debated [2,3]. Introducing this system in ouruniversity hospital was supposed to improve the mortality andlength of ICU stay for patients admitted to the ICU through thissystem.Methods The MET was established in our hospital in June 2006. Two groups of patients admitted to the ICU during a 2-year periodwere compared (before the MET call system and after itsintroduction).Results The standard group of patients admitted to the ICU within a 6-month period before introducing the MET call system included115 patients; male/female 76/39; APACHE II score 25 (18 to 31);age 63 (53 to 74) years; length of stay 4 (2 to 9) days; mortality22.6%, and was compared with the group admitted through theMET system: 100 patients; male/female 58/42; APACHE II score23 (21 to 29); age 69 (59 to 75) years; length of stay 5 (3 to 9)days; mortality 32%. Variables are expressed as the median (IQR).There were no statistically significant differences between groupscalculated by the chi-square and Mann-Whitney U tests.Conclusions The mortality and length of ICU stay of patients admitted to the ICU by the standard system compared with thoseadmitted through the MET call system were not different. Earlydetection of the critically ill patients in the university hospital issupposed to improve their management and outcome. Accordingto our results, we cannot so far confirm this statement.References1.

Whileoffering the potential for cure, it continues to be associated withsignificant morbidity and mortality, with 10 to 40% of recipientsrequiring admission to the ICU. Critical Care Outreach (CCO) is aservice designed to provide timely access to ICU-level care andearlier stabilization of critically ill patients. The objective of ourstudy was to compare outcomes of adult HSCT recipients before and after the initiation of a CCO team.Methods Adults undergoing HSCT at The Ottawa Hospital were divided into the pre-CCO cohort (January 2000 to December2004, n= 520) and the post-CCO cohort (January 2005 to December 2007, n= 309). The primary outcome was nonrelapse mortality at day 100 post-transplant (NRM-100). Secondaryoutcomes were incidence of ICU admission, duration of ICUadmission, incidence of mechanical ventilation (MV), duration ofMV, APACHE II score and number of failing organs at time of ICUadmission, and NRM-100 for patients admitted to the ICU.Results Following the introduction of CCO, there was a trend towards reduced NRM-100 (10.2% vs. 8.4%, P= 0.46) and reduced incidence of admission (13.6% vs. 12.3%, P= 0.65) for all HSCT patients. For those admitted to the ICU, there were nosignificant differences pre-CCO and post-CCO in the proportionof patients requiring MV (70.3% vs. 78.6%, P = 0.47), duration of MV (8.9 vs. 8.5 days, P = 0.87), length of ICU admission (12.6 vs. 17.4 days, P = 0.25), APACHE II score (23.8 vs. 23.5, P = 0.78), and NRM-100 (48% vs. 50%, P = NS). The number of failed organs upon admission to the ICU, however, was significantlyreduced (2.31 vs. 1.85, P = 0.039). Patients undergoing post-CCO had a nonsignificant reduction inNRM-100 (22.5% vs. 18.0%, P = 0.25), and for those admitted to the ICU we detected a trend towards reduced duration of MV(10.4 vs. 6.0 days, P = 0.11) and improved NRM-100 (71.4% vs. 53.8%, P = 0.19). Conclusions CCO in a tertiary care HSCT program is associated with a trend towards reduced nonrelapse mortality and ICUadmission. Patients transferred to the ICU in the post-CCO erahad fewer failed organ systems at the time of ICU admission.Those patients at highest risk of treatment-related complicationsappeared to experience greater overall benefit from the CCOintervention. Our experience suggests that CCO be considered animportant service for HSCT transplant centres. P474 Audit of care provided prior to ICU admission R Appleton, D Alcorn, A McCollRoyal Alexandra 13(Suppl 1): P474 (doi: 10.1186/cc7638) Introduction Our hypothesis was that critically ill patients admitted to our district general ICU were frequently receiving suboptimalresuscitative care and monitoring prior to ICU admission. A confi-dential enquiry over 10 years ago in two hospitals in England foundsuch a situation [1].Methods All patients admitted to our ICU from 1 January to 8 March 2008 had their case notes, monitoring charts and drugprescriptions reviewed by an ICU consultant. The adequacy ofresuscitative care and monitoring was assessed using a 10 cmvisual analogue scale (VAS). Where care was felt to beinadequate, reasoning was documented. If a central venouscatheter (CVC) had been inserted, the specialty of the doctor whoperformed the procedure was documented.Results There were 64 admissions during the study period, eight were excluded (ICU transfers from other hospitals) and all 56remaining were analysed. Median VAS scores for adequacy ofresuscitative care and monitoring are presented in Table 1. In nine(17%) patients care was felt to be inadequate. The two mostcommon reasons (five patients each) were inadequate circulatorymanagement, particularly failure to commence inotropic/vaso-pressor therapy, and inadequate monitoring, particularly fluidbalance and invasive cardiovascular monitoring. CVCs wereCritical Care March 2009 Vol 13 Suppl 1 29th International Symposium on Intensive Care and Emergency MedicineS191inserted by ICU/anaesthetic staff on 56% of occasions, by emergency department staff on 25% of occasions, surgical staff on13% and medical staff on 6%.Conclusions Suboptimal resuscitative care and monitoring prior to ICU admission is present in a significant minority of our patientsand appears particularly related to the management of hypotensionand shock. Further training focusing on these areas (includingCVC insertion) for noncritical care trained staff may help improvepatient care and outcome.Reference1.

P475 Covering the cardiac ICU at night: a national survey of existing levels of cover and the potential for change with implementation of the European working time directive RL Eve, PM Robbins Derriford Hospital, Plymouth, UKCritical Care 2009, 13(Suppl 1): P475 (doi: 10.1186/cc7639) Introduction During 2009 the European working time directive (EWTD) requires trainee doctors to work an average 48-hour week[1]. Hospitals will be seeking novel methods to cover existingmedical rotas. We aimed to establish whether it would bereasonable to reduce current levels of out-of-hours (OOH) medicalcover in cardiac ICUs (CICUs) based upon current UK practice.Methods All UK units caring for cardiac surgical patients were contacted in January 2008. OOH medical cover was ascertainedby speaking to either a consultant or a senior nurse. The 30-daysurvival rate and annual caseload for all cardiac surgery over a3-year period up to March 2006 were analysed [2].Results Thirty-nine CICUs were contacted. Three were excluded because of incomplete data. OOH anaesthetic specialist registrar(ASpR) cover for CICUs is presented in Table 1. The 30-daysurvival rate for cardiac surgery over a 3-year period ending March2006 was either the same as or higher than expected based onpredictive EuroSCORE data for all units. One centre performing<1,000 cases per year employed a nurse practitioner trained inintubation and central venous cannulation rather than having adedicated ASpR.Conclusions Units undertaking >1,000 cases per year have dedicated OOH ASpR cover. EuroSCOREs are increasingamongst UK cardiac surgical patients because of increasing age,and this leads to lower predicted survival [3]. A reduction inmedical cover on CICUs to facilitate implementation of the EWTD would be counterintuitive and outside current UK practice for unitsperforming >1,000 cases per year. Novel models exist but morework is required to establish their safety in larger units.References1. Waurick R, et al.: The European Working Time Directive: effect on education and clinical care.

P476 Timing of first review of new ICU admissions by consultant intensivists in a UK district general hospital P Mullen1, A Dawood2, J White1, M Anthony-Pillai1 1Countess of Foundation Trust Hospital, Chester, UK; 2Edinburgh Royal Infirmary, Critical Care 2009, 13(Suppl 1): P476 (doi: 10.1186/cc7640) Introduction Patient outcome has been linked to the timing of the first senior medical review in emergency medical admissions tohospital, and after ICU admission [1,2]. The National ConfidentialEnquiry into Patient Outcome and Death (NCEPOD) 2005 reportrevealed that in participating UK ICUs 75% of new ICU patientshad a consultant intensivist review within 12 hours of admission[3]. This is now a recommended standard, although data were onlyavailable for 40% of patients, and neither supportive patientoutcome data nor pre-ICU review timings were cited.Methods By retrospective review of patients' ICU medical notes, we studied the length of time in hours to first consultant intensivistreview before and after ICU admission in 122 consecutivepatients. We also examined mortality and length of stay (LOS)outcomes in patients reviewed early (<12 hours) and late(>12 hours) after ICU admission. Continuous data are expressedas the median (IQR).Results Overall, data were available for 96 patients reviewed after ICU admission (median = 6.0, IQR = 1.1 to 14.7 hours), 79 (82%)of these reviews being early (median = 3, IQR = 0.5 to 7.5). ICUmortality for the early group was 31.6% during a median ICU LOSof 1.8 days (IQR = 0.9 to 7.9). Median review time for the lategroup ( n= 17) was 21 hours (IQR = 18.5 to 28.4), with an ICU mortality of 23.5%, during a median ICU LOS of 8.1 days (IQR =2.1 to 14). The early group had a significantly shorter ICU LOS(P= 0.007, two-sided Mann-Whitney test) than the late group, and there was no significant proportional difference in ICUmortality between the two groups. Furthermore, before ICUadmission, 56/122 patients (46%) had been reviewed by aconsultant intensivist (median = 2.2, IQR = 1.2 to 4.0 hours), andin many patients this constituted the only such review prior to12 hours into ICU admission.Conclusions Review by a consultant intensivist is common before ICU admission.

However, the effect thatintermediate care units can have on the case-mix of specific ICUsand how this relates to measures of morbidity, mortality andseverity of illness is not clear.Methods We analyzed data from two cohorts of ICU patients staying >24 hours, which were prospectively collected from March2000 to April 2001 and from March 2006 to April 2007 in a 12-bed cardiologic-pulmonary ICU in a tertiary-care center universityhospital. Two intermediate care step-down units were introducedin between, with the units fully operational in 2005. We compareddemographics, measures of resource use, severity of illness andmortality.Results Totals of 705 and 389 patients (-45%) were admitted in 2000/01 and in 2006/07. There were no significant differences ingender distribution or age (68% vs. 64% male, mean age 64 \u00b1 13.5vs. 66 \u00b1 14.2 years). While acute coronary syndrome remained themost common diagnosis (33% vs. 32%), a larger proportion ofpatients were admitted due to cardiogenic shock (8% vs. 26%)and sepsis (2% vs. 8%). More patients were admitted after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (8% vs. 25%) and on MV (14% vs. 35%).ICU mortality increased from 9% to 22% with subsequent mortalityoutside the ICU equal at 4% for both cohorts. The meanSequential Organ Failure Assessment score on the admission dayincreased from 2.1 \u00b1 2.9 to 7.6 \u00b1 2.8 for survivors and 7.7 \u00b1 4.8to 10.8 \u00b1 3.0 for the dead. ICU length of stay (LOS) increasedfrom 5 \u00b1 10.2 to 8 \u00b1 12.2 days for survivors and 7 \u00b1 10.8 to 12 \u00b114.8 days for the dead, while hospital LOS was nearly unchangedregardless of survival status. Physician staffing and nurse-to-patientratios did not change (two physicians and 1:3 during days and onephysician and 1:4 during nights).Conclusions The implementation of an intermediate care unit led to a significant change in the ICU case-mix with increased ICULOS, mortality and severity of illness of patients admitted. Effectson nurse workloads, team job satisfaction, and critical care triageshould be further analyzed to optimize the treatment of thesecritically ill patients.P478 Improvement in clinical outcomes following institution of dedicated critical care support in the high-dependency unit DJ Beckett, CF Gordon, M Hawkins Stirling Royal Infirmary, Stirling, UKCritical Care 2009, 13(Suppl 1): P478 (doi: 10.1186/cc7642) Introduction A recent Scottish Medical and Scientific Advisory Committee report has recommended greater intensivist input intohigh-dependency units (HDUs). At Stirling Royal Infirmary, patientsin the HDU remained under speciality team care, in an open unitmodel, leading to significant inconsistencies in quality of care. InDecember 2007 a closed unit policy was implemented withintensivists providing clinical leadership of the unit. We hypo-thesized that having a single team responsible for all HDU patientswould improve continuity of care, with this being reflected inclinical outcome.Methods The Scottish Intensive Care Society's database, Wardwatcher, was used to retrospectively gather data from the12 months preceding, and 12 months following critical careinvolvement in the HDU. We investigated three outcome measuresof patients who required transfer to the ICU from the HDU duringthese periods: requirement for renal replacement therapy (RRT),length of stay (level 3 days), and ICU mortality.Results Following critical care involvement in the HDU, the total number of HDU admissions per annum fell from 1,372 to 1,197,allowing for the closure of two HDU beds. Ninety-three patientswere transferred to the ICU from the HDU in the pre-change12 months, compared with 67 subsequently. There were nosignificant differences in age, APACHE II scores, or requirementfor mechanical ventilation. The requirement for RRT decreasedsignificantly from 32% to 16% ( P = 0.02). This alone is associated with a cost saving of between \u00a315,000 and \u00a325,000. The meanlength of stay (level 3) reduced from 7.0 days to 6.0 days, which incombination with the reduction in ICU admissions saved 250 level3 bed-days over 12 months. Finally there was a trend towardsreduced ICU mortality (31% vs. 19%, P = 0.09). Conclusions Implementing a critical-care-led closed unit policy in the HDU was associated with an immediate reduction in both HDUand ICU bed-days, allowing planned bed closures. There was asignificant reduction in need for RRT and a trend towards reducedICU mortality. Finally this organisational change has been carriedout with significant cost savings that are likely to be sustained. P479 Effects of a closed ICU model on a general surgical ICU K Chittawatanarat, T PamorsinlapathumChiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, ThailandCritical Care 2009, 13(Suppl 1): P479 (doi: 10.1186/cc7643) Introduction A closed model of ICU care is associated with improved outcomes and less resource utilization in mixed medicaland surgical ICUs as well as traumatic ICUs. However, most of ourcountry ICUs use an open model, especially in surgical ICUs dueto lack of specialized physicians. The aims of this study are tocompare the effects of closed and open models on ICU mortalityand length of ICU stay.Methods We conducted a retrospective study to compare two periods of time that used an open model (July 2002 to June 2004;1,038 patients) and a closed model (July 2004 to June 2006;1,231 patients) on a single general surgical ICU in a universityhospital. The closed model was defined as an ICU service led andmanaged by an intensivist. The open model was an ICU service inCritical Care March 2009 Vol 13 Suppl 1 29th International Symposium on Intensive Care and Emergency MedicineS193which critically ill surgical patients were managed by host surgeons individually. Results A total of 2,269 patients were included in this study (open vs. closed; 1,038 vs. 1,231). The overall ICU mortality rate was decreased statistically significantly in the closed model (27.4% vs. 23.4%; P = 0.03). This effect was obvious in patients who were admitted to the ICU for more than 48 hours (22.7% vs. 13.9%; P<0.01). After adjusting for differences in baseline characteristics, the relative risk of death in a closed model ICU was 0.85 (0.74 to 0.98; P = 0.02) compared with the open model. The effect was explicit in patients admitted to the ICU for more than 48 hours (0.60 (0.47 to 0.76); P <0.01), in nontraumatic patients (0.81 (0.64 to 1.01)) and a trend toward to statistical significance in patients older than 65 years (0.81 (0.64 to 1.01); P = 0.07). In addition, the closed model ICU also decreased, the length of ICU stay (5.4 \u00b1 7.1 vs. 4.6 \u00b1 6.1 days; P <0.01) and the adjusted risk ratio was 0.45 (0.26 to 0.78; P0.01) when compared with the open model. Conclusions The closed model that can be led and managed by an intensivist is associated with a reduction in overall ICU mortality and a greatest effect in patients admitted for more than 48 hours. Furthermore, this model also decreases the ICU length of stay. P480 Early transfer to a high-volume ICU (upgrading) reduces mortality P Van der Molen, H Oudemans van Straaten, D Zandstra, I Van Bosman, J Wester, P Van der Voort OLVG, Critical Care 2009, 13(Suppl 1): P480 (doi: 10.1186/cc7644) Introduction The outcome of ICU treatment is improved in high- volume compared with low-volume ICUs [1]. It is unclear whether transfer of patients from a low-volume to a high-volume ICU (upgrading) improves outcome and whether early transfer is beneficial. Methods In a retrospective cohort study the timing of upgrading was determined and related to mortality. Included were all upgraded patients transported to our level 3 ICU between 2002 and 2008. The APACHE II score was determined in the first24 hours after admission to the high-volume ICU. Odds ratios, the Mann-Whitney test and multiple regression were performed. Results Three hundred and eighty-five patients were included with a mean age of 62 years (SD = 14.8) and mean APACHE II score of 22.5 (SD = 8.4). The median time to transfer was 1 day (IQR = 4). Patients transported immediately after stabilisation to the high- volume ICU (ICU length of stay (LOS) before transfer = 0) had a mortality rate of 9% (Figure 1). Mortality in patients with ICU LOS before transport >0 was 25% ( P<0.001). In a multiple regression analysis a higher APACHE II score was associated with increased mortality (OR = 1.1, 95% CI = 1.0 to 1.2), as was APACHE II predicted mortality. Immediate transfer was associated with a decrease in ICU mortality (OR = 0.38; 95% CI = 0.18 to 0.80) and hospital mortality (OR = 0.51; 95% CI = 0.27 to 0.95). In patients with upgrading as the explicit reason for transport the findings were the same (OR = 0.15; 95% CI = 0.03 to 0.71). Conclusions In this retrospective cohort study patients who were immediately transferred from a low-volume to a high-volume level 3 ICU had a lower mortality compared with patients with delayed transfer, which was independent of the APACHE score.

Am Resp Crit L Loveday, N Rasburn, M Thomas Bristol Royal Infirmary, UK Critical Care 2009, 13(Suppl 1): P481 (doi: 10.1186/cc7645) Introduction The present study aims to compare the diagnostic categories and outcomes for teenagers admitted to the paediatric ICU (PICU) and the adult ICU over a 3-year period. The UK Paediatric Intensive Care society has agreed consensus standards for the care of critically ill patients up to the age of 16 years [1]. The UK National Service Framework for Children defines a child as 'all those under 19 years' [2]. To date, there are no specific national standards addressing the care of teenagers on intensive care. Methods All patients aged between 16 and 19 years of age admitted to both the adult ICU and the PICU were retrospectively enrolled between January 2005 and June 2008. A revised version of the Paediatric Index of Mortality (PIM2) was used to calculate predicted mortality in the two groups. Results A total of 50 and 46 patients aged between 16 and 19 years were admitted to the adult ICU and the PICU, respec- tively. The average predicted risk of mortality for those aged 16 to 19 years on the adult ICU was 3.98% and the actual mortality was comparable at 4%. On the PICU, the average predicted risk of mortality for those aged 16 to 19 years was 5.23% and the actual mortality for this age group was higher than predicted at 6.52%. On the PICU, 50% of the total admissions had a primary diagnosis of congenital disorder followed by 13% with neuromuscular disorders. On the adult ICU, trauma accounted for 31% of total admissions, followed by diabetic ketoacidosis at 17%. Interest- ingly, self-harm/overdose accounted for 11.5% of teenage admissions to the adult ICU compared with none on the PICU. Conclusions The outcomes for patients aged 16 to 19 years are similar in both the PICU and the adult ICU; however, there is significant variation in the diagnostic profile. Further larger-scale studies are needed to develop a standardised and pragmatic approach to this age group of patients.Available online http://ccforum.com/supplements/13/S1 Figure 1 (abstract P480) S194References 1.

P482 Verbal orders drug therapy and prescription in a UK ICU setting S Evans1, P Mullen2 1Christie Hospital, Manchester, UK; 2Countess of Chester 2009, 13(Suppl 1): P482 (doi: 10.1186/cc7646) Introduction Verbal orders (VOs) drug therapy refers to drug administration without prescription, usually in the context oftelephone instructions from a physician at a remote location orother circumstances involving delayed prescription. In somemedical care settings VOs may constitute 2 to 13% of medicationorders [1]. Prescription errors associated with VOs are reputedlycommon [2], although some studies suggest otherwise [3].Although prescription errors are not uncommon in critical care [4],little is known about VOs in this setting.Methods We prospectively audited VOs in a hardcopy-prescribing five-bed ICU setting over a period of 3 weeks, with voluntary dataentry by any member of staff issuing or receiving a drug therapy VO.We collected information regarding VO timing, medication involved,clinical indication, and subsequent drug event prescription.Results Nine VOs were recorded during multiple drug interventions for 19 ICU patients in this period, with a VO eventrate of 1 for every 10 ITU bed-days. All VOs were for intravenousprescription only medication, five of which were for fluid therapy totreat acute physiological deterioration. Other drugs includedmetoclopramide, furosemide, atracurium, and adrenaline. No VOsfor opiates were recorded. Reasons for initial nonprescriptionincluded remote location, aseptic procedure, and emergencytreatment. Eight prescriptions were completed within 2 hours. NoVOs were recorded during overnight shifts. All grades of medicalstaff issued VOs. One transcription error was noted. No adverseevents were noted.Conclusions Critical care VOs are not uncommon. Minimisation can be achieved by good communication, hardcopy or electronicbundle prescribing, locally agreed independent nonphysicianprescribing arrangements, or drug administration in specificsettings, particularly pre-prescription of fluid bolus therapy.References1.

P483 Effects of organizational change in the ICU on high-risk surgical patients: a comparison of open and closed formats B Liebman, J Beute, C Slagt, JW Mulder, AF 1): P483 (doi: 10.1186/cc7647) Introduction In 2000 the ICU in a teaching hospital in the Netherlands changed from open to closed format. In thisretrospective study, outcomes of high-risk surgical patients before and after the organizational change were compared.Methods From 1990 to 2004, all surgical patients were prospectively collected in a database containing information aboutthe type of surgery, use of the ICU, length of hospital stay,complications, and mortality. Multivariate logistic regression wasused on these data to develop a risk prediction model for mortality.The model consisted of the variables acute hospital admission,acute surgery, severity of surgery and age. Severity of surgery wasbased on a classification of surgical operations used in teachinghospitals in the Netherlands, scoring operations as one to sevenpoints. More than three points was defined as severe. Age wasdivided into quartiles. Points were scored per variable. In total, sixpoints could be scored: acute admission, acute surgery and severesurgery received one point. Age scored zero to three points. A totalscore of four points or more was defined as high risk. The modelwas validated through cross-validation. The area under the receiveroperating characteristics curve was 0.9. ICU use, morbidity andmortality before and after the change from open to closed formatwere retrospectively evaluated.Results Two groups were defined: Group A: high-risk surgical patients in the ICU in 1996 and 1997 (open format, n= 230) and Group B: high-risk surgical patients in the ICU in 2003 and 2004(closed format, n= 228). The primary outcome was inhospital mortality. Secondary outcomes were inhospital morbidity andlength of ICU stay. The groups were comparable in age, genderand type of surgery.Mortality of the ICU patients was 25.4% in Group A and 15.9% inGroup B ( P <0.01, 95% CI = 2.5 to 17.3). This was a relative change of 37.6%. Morbidity was 48.3% in Group A and 46.3% inGroup B. The average length of ICU stay was 2.5 days in Group A,and 4.8 days in Group B ( P = 0.001). Conclusions Changing an ICU organization to a closed format reduces mortality in high-risk surgical patients, without affectingmorbidity. P484 Study of the ability of ICU staff to set a bed to the semi-recumbent position MG Keane, R Kapoor Kent P484 (doi: 10.1186/cc7648) Introduction The aim of this study was to assess the accuracy of setting the angle of the head of a bed to the semi-recumbentposition. Ventilator-acquired pneumonias (VAPs) account for 31%of all ICU infections. appears to be aspiration ofcontaminated oropharyngeal and gastric secretions around theendotracheal tube. The semi-recumbent position compared withthe supine position is known to significantly reduce the incidenceof VAP (8% vs. 34%) [1]. Hence the National Institute for ClinicalExcellence in the UK publishing a recommendation that ventilatedpatients be nursed at an angle of 30\u00b0 to 45\u00b0.Methods Fifty-five members of ICU staff were asked to set the angle of the head of a standard ICU bed to 30\u00b0 and 45\u00b0. Theestimated bed angle was then measured accurately using aMathey Dearman protractor.Results When estimating the head of the bed, nursing staff were the most accurate (Table 1) while other staff significantlyunderestimated the angle of the bed. We also found that greaterexperience of working in the ICU is likely to improve ability toestimate the angle of the head of bed accurately.Critical Care March 2009 Vol 13 Suppl 1 29th International Symposium on Intensive Care and Emergency MedicineS195Conclusions Evidence suggests patients should be nursed in the semi-recumbent position to prevent VAP. However, we have foundestimating the angle of a bed by eye is difficult and ofteninaccurate. Simple aids that highlight the angle of the bed havebeen shown to improve compliance to the semi-recumbentposition by up to 71.5% compared with 21% in one study [2].Such aids to set the angle of the bed should be introduced incommon practice to improve compliance with VAP guidelines.References1.

P485 Diagnosis-related group-based reimbursement is unrealistic for ICUs A Mclaughlin, J Hardt, J Canavan, MB Donnelly Adelaide Meath 2009, 13(Suppl 1): P485 (doi: 10.1186/cc7649) Introduction The objective of this study was to compare the results from a microcosting analysis of a cohort of ICU patientswith the reimbursement based on existing diagnosis-related group(DRG) systems. Hence, we open the discussion on resourceallocation using ICD-10 coding and its impact on intensive care.Methods A prospective study costing 58 consecutive admissions over a 2-month period in a mixed medical/surgical ICU. Subse-quently, aligning these patient costs with the attributed costs usingICD-10 coding. Medical records in Ireland are coded using ICD-10for diagnoses and for procedures. Experienced clinical codersassign codes, which are entered into the code mapping program(AR-DRG V5.0).Results Our microcosting study demonstrated that the median daily ICU cost (IQR) was \u20ac2,205 ( \u20ac1,932 to \u20ac3,073) and the was \u20ac10,916 ( \u20ac4,294 to \u20ac24,091). The microcosting study demonstrated that the total ICU cost for 58admissions was \u20ac1,200,524. Reimbursement for the total hospital stay including the ICU stay based on DRGs was \u20ac782,077. During our study, use of antifungals, hemodialysis and bloodproducts were found to be independent predictors of increasedICU cost. These frequently used intensive care treatments are notadequately costed.Conclusions Advances in intensive care diagnostics and treatment contribute to the high cost of this specialty. CurrentDRG-based funding fails to adequately capture and cost ICUactivity, and thus underfunds intensive care. We recommend thatan ICU-specific DRG coding be developed for intensive care.P486 Waiting rooms and facilities available to patients' families and visitors in Italian pediatric ICUs: a national survey A Giannini1, G lo 2009, 13(Suppl 1): P486 (doi: 10.1186/cc7650) Introduction Families of critically ill patients spend a considerable amount of time in hospital, both beside their loved ones in the ICUand outside the unit waiting to visit them or to receive news. Nopublished data are available to date on the provision of waitingrooms in Italy's pediatric ICUs (PICUs) and on the facilitiesavailable to patients' families and visitors. We investigated theseaspects in the course of a national survey concerning visitingpolicies in Italian PICUs.Methods An email questionnaire was sent to the heads of all 34 Italian PICUs asking about their visiting policies. Questions aboutwaiting rooms and facilities for patients' families and visitors werealso included.Results The response rate was 100%. The median daily visiting time was 300 minutes (range 30 minutes to 24 hours). No waitingroom was provided in 32% of PICUs. In other PICUs, families andvisitors were provided with seats (50% of PICUs), armchairs(32%), lockers for personal effects (32%), magazines and books(18%), drinks machines (15%) and snack machines (6%). Abathroom was available to families and visitors in 41% of units, useof the PICU's kitchen in 3% and access to the hospital canteen in47%.Conclusions Overall these data indicate that in Italian PICUs, alongside a clear tendency to apply restricted visiting policies,there is limited attention to the comfort of families of patients in thePICU. Comfort is one of five domains (in addition to reassurance,proximity, information and support) associated with the needs offamilies who have critically ill loved ones [1,2]. Our survey couldcontribute to promoting more attentive and supportive care for thepatient's family [3].Acknowledgment Supported by Associazione per il Bambino Nefropatico, Milan, Italy.References1.

P487 Patient satisfaction in the ICU: level of satisfaction and influencing factors AC Jansen, M Van den Beld, M Goudriaan, HA Middelkoop, MS ArbousLeiden University 13(Suppl 1): P487 (doi: 10.1186/cc7651) Introduction To optimize patient care, knowledge of patient satisfaction and its determinants is essential. So far few researchershave focused on this subject in intensive care medicine. Thepurpose of this study was to measure the level of patientsatisfaction and determine its influencing factors in ICU patients.Available online http://ccforum.com/supplements/13/S1 Table 1 (abstract P484) Mean estimates Group 30\u00b0 estimate 45\u00b0 estimate Nurses 30.4 43.1 Doctors 27.1 42.1Other staff 26.1 39.6S196Methods In a pilot study, we developed a questionnaire that consisted of 60 questions in eight domains (General satisfaction,Reception, Physical care, Mental care, Empathy and attention,Communication and information, Surroundings and Physicaldiscomfort). Answering possibilities ranged from 1 (not satisfied) to5 (completely satisfied). In the final study, 23 March to 29 May2008, all consecutive adult patients from a 29-bed, tertiary-care,medical, surgical, neurosurgical and thoracic-surgical ICU wereinterviewed within 4 days after discharge. Demographics andclinical characteristics were obtained from electronic records.General linear modeling (GLM) with Bonferroni-Holmes correctionwas used to study the relationship between overall patientsatisfaction scores and the eight domains, corrected for patientand ICU-related factors. The model was tested for clinicallyrelevant interaction between determinants.Results Ninety-eight patients were interviewed. The mean overall patient satisfaction score was 4.60 (SD = 0.93). Of the eightdomains, only Communication and information ( P= 0.039) appeared to be significant in predicting general satisfaction. Alsosex (P = 0.046), length of ICU stay ( P = 0.042), the interaction between Communication and information and age ( P= 0.016), and the interaction between Communication and information andMinimal Mental State Examination score ( P= 0.013) were signifi- cant. An indepth analysis of Communication and informationshowed that the interaction of communication with birth country(P<0.0001) and with duration of mechanical ventilation (P= 0.041) was significant. This implies that, for Dutch versus non-Dutch patients and patients longer on mechanical ventilation,clear communication with doctors and nurses was particularlyimportant.Conclusions Patient satisfaction was high in this mixed population of ICU patients. From an especially developed questionnaire,Communication and information was the most important predictor.In addition, older age, female sex, Dutch nationality, longer ICU stay,long duration of mechanical ventilation and a high Minimal MentalState Examination score were related to less satisfied patients. P488 Use of deferred proxy consent in two emergency critical care trials E Kompanje, T Jansen, J Le Noble, H De Geus, J Bakker Erasmus MC University Medical 2009, 13(Suppl P488 (doi: 10.1186/cc7652) Introduction Almost all patients with life-threatening conditions are incapacitated to give informed consent for participation inemergency critical care research. Deferred proxy consent (DPC) isan ethically valid surrogate for informed patient consent. Here wepresent our experience in two emergency trials [1].Methods We analysed the use of DPC in the Early Lactate- directed Therapy in Intensive Care Trial (NCT 00270673) and theNGAL study (TC 1405).Results In the lactate-directed therapy trial, 362 patients were randomized. In 75.4% DPC could be obtained, 3.9% of therelatives refused DPC and in 20.7% DPC could not be obtainedbefore the end of the study (= 72 hours). In the NGAL study, 550patients were randomized. DPC or patient consent was obtained in89.8%, 0.7% refused DPC and in 9.4% DPC could not beobtained due to early patient death. In both studies combined, onlyin 2% was DPC refused and in 10% consent could not beobtained due to early patient death.Conclusions DPC is an ethically valid and practically feasible way to include patients in emergency critical care trials.Reference 1.

P489 Outcome and prognostic factors in critically ill cancer patients with diagnosis of sepsis in the ICU R Kalil Filho1, L Hajjar1, M (doi: 10.1186/cc7653) Introduction As overall survival times increase for patients with cancer due to novel antitumour treatments, there will be aninevitable escalation in the number of such patients who present tointensive care with intercurrent acute illness, and sepsis is themost frequent diagnosis in this context. Epidemiologic estimates ofsepsis among cancer patients are limited. The aim of this studywas to assess survival in cancer patients admitted to an ICU with adiagnosis of sepsis, trying to identify predictive factors of mortality.Methods A prospective cohort study in an ICU at a university cancer referral center. From a total of 95 patients admitted to theICU during a period of 3 months, 78 patients had the diagnosis ofsepsis into 24 hours of admission. Patient charts were analyzedwith respect to underlying disease, cause of admission, APACHE IIscore, need and duration for mechanical ventilation, neutropeniaand development of septic shock, type of infection, time to anti-biotic therapy, as well as ICU survival and survival after discharge.Results ICU survival of septic patients was 76%, and 1-month survival was 66%. In a multivariate analysis, prognosis wasnegatively influenced by respiratory insufficiency, the need formechanical ventilation, and development of septic shock and renalfailure after 72 hours of ICU stay. Admission after cardiopulmonaryresuscitation yielded high ICU mortality. Age, neutropenia, type ofinfection, and underlying disease did not influence outcomesignificantly. Admission APACHE II scores were significantlyhigher in nonsurvivors but failed to predict individual outcomesatisfactorily.Conclusions A combination of factors must be taken into account to estimate a critically ill cancer patient's prognosis in the ICUadmitted because of sepsis. The APACHE II scoring system aloneshould not be used to make decisions about therapy prolongation.As ICU mortality is 24%, comparable with severely ill noncancerpatients, general reluctance to admit cancer patients to an ICUdoes not seem to be justified.References1.

This study presents our experience oftreating and management of TEN in a burn center.Methods We retrospectively analysed the charts of all patients with severe skin disease admitted to the burn center of Tunisbetween 2001 and 2008. The patients were evaluated accordingto their history of pre-existing diseases and medication, suspectedcause, extent of skin involvement (TBSA), mucosal involvement,definitive diagnosis, therapy, complications and outcome. Resultswere collected and examined with SPSS 16.0 software.Results During the study period, 21 patients with severe bullous skin disease were admitted. Fifteen of them had TEN (threepatients per year). All patients were referred from outsideinstitutions, especially from dermatology departments, meanhospital duration of 4 \u00b1 2 days. The group of 15 patients consistedof 10 women and five men. The average age was 50 \u00b1 17 years.The average affected skin area was 49 \u00b1 15% of TBSA. Thesuspected causal agent was aspirin in three cases, phenobarbitalin three cases, allopurinol in three cases, antibiotics in two casesand paracetamol in one case. It was unknown in three cases. Itwas medical prescription in 10 cases, automedication in threecases and unknown in two cases. The mean time delay betweendrug intake and the onset of symptoms was 4.5 \u00b1 1.5 days.Mucosal involvement was observed in all patients, such as ocular,gastrointestinal, respiratory and genital localizations. The mostcommon complications ware: sepsis, ARDS and hematologicaldisorders (two pancytopenia and one CIVD). The mean duration ofhospitalization was 9 \u00b1 6 days. The overall mortality rate was 30%.There was a significant statistical difference between survival andnonsurviving patients, in involved skin area ( P= 0.04) and septic complications ( P<0.001). Conclusions TEN is a severe mucocutaneous reaction, associated with high morbidity and mortality. Management of theses patientsmust be provided cautiously by an experienced interdisciplinaryteam in an ICU. P491 Pesticide poisoning in the region of Rodopi, Greece N Vavatsiklis, G Grigoriadis, C (doi: 10.1186/cc7655) Introduction Pesticide poisoning constitutes a problem that often occurs in the daily medical practice and mainly concerns the ruralareas of Greece. The purpose of this project is to mention theepidemic characteristics and our observations on unintentionalpesticide and herbicide poisonings in the prefecture of Rodopi,Greece.Methods In our retrospective study that refers to a period of 2 years (January 2006 to December 2007), 152 patients sufferingfrom pesticide poisoning were offered medical treatment in thepathologic ward of the General Hospital of Komotini. One hundredand nineteen (78.30%) of them were patients who unintentionallysuffered pesticide poisoning. The remaining 20 (13.15%) werepoisoned with pharmaceutical substances of domestic use. Therewere also 13 (8.55%) cases of attempted suicide with intentionalintake of an overdose of antidepressants that were exempt fromour study.Results Fourteen out of the 119 patients (11.76%) were trans- ferred to hospital in a state of a coma (Glasgow coma scale <8)and were treated in the ICU and underwent blood refinery. Therewere two deaths (2/119 or 1.68%). The average age of ourpatients was 37 years (14 to 89). The proportion of men/womenwas 2.4/1 (84/35) and the poisonings took place at the beginning of the summer.Conclusions Unintentional pesticide poisonings are frequent in our area. They concern people of low educational level, mainly menof a reproductive age [1,2]. The time spent from the intake of thepesticide to their transfer to hospital plays an important role in thesuccessful treatment of such cases [3]. Moreover, for a positiveoutcome in these severe cases it is essential that these patientsare treated in ICUs [3,4].References1. Rousos X: Drug Poisonings and Drug Coma. Intensive Care.

Biomarkers usedon admission: serum cholinesterase level, arterial pH and influence of obidoxime and atropine therapy on thepatient outcome was also analyzed.Results Twenty patients were admitted to the ICU. Dimethoate was the compound most often involved, in which 55% of thepatients were females. The mean age recorded was 54.3 \u00b1 14.7years. The time between exposure and treatment initiation was notquantified in 65% of patients, but when discriminated it was in themajority of cases less than 1 hour. Clinical muscarinic signs in85% of the cases, nicotinic signs in 55% and central nervoussigns in 95%. An intermediate syndrome was identified in onecase. Most frequent complications identified were pneumonitis85%, miocarditis 35% and renal failure 50% of the patients. Themean SAPS II value was 36.6 \u00b1 16.9. Selective decontaminationand treatment with obidoxime (continuous intravenous infusionafter the loading dose) and atropine was verified in every patient(Figure 1). The total ICU mortality was 40%.Conclusions Clinical severity and serum cholinesterase levels and acidosis were the independent variables that mostly seemed tohave contributed for the final result. High doses of atropineseemed to be more favorable to a good outcome. Even though thenumber of patients included in this review was small, the resultsmay alert us to the importance of an organized approach helped byprotocols between the emergency department/emergency roomAvailable online http://ccforum.com/supplements/13/S1S198and the ICU, in order to successfully manage patients with organophosphate poisoning.

Methods We retrospectively observed cases of lactic acidosis, searching for MALA cases, admitted to the ICU from January 2008 to November 2008. Results We present three patients. Patient 1 is a 63-year-ols man with type 2 diabetes who came to the emergency department (ED) with leg pain for 2 days; he was on metformin 3 g daily. Laboratory results showed acute renal failure (ARF) and lactic acidosis (pH 6.88; lactate 23 mmol/l). Angiography lower arm ischemia. Continuous venovenous haemo- filtration (CVVH) was started due to ARF and acidosis (Table 1). Patient 2, a 77-year-old man with type 2 diabetes, came to the ED with vomiting and diarrhea for 3 days. He was on metformin 3 g daily. Laboratory results showed ARF, lactic acidosis (pH 6.80; lactate 18 mmol/l) and cells 19.000/ l, serum procalcitonin 10.85 g/l); due to ARF and acidosis, CVVH was started. Patient 3 is a 72-year-old woman with type 2 diabetes who came to the ED with diarrhea and vomiting for 4 days; she was on metformin 3 g daily. Laboratory results showed leucocytosis, ARF and lactic acidosis (pH 6.83; lactate 16 mmol/l).No of lactic acidosis differential diagnosis were found, so CVVH was started due to ARF and acidosis. Conclusions All three patients survived after support therapy and CVVH were started. In these cases, metformin could be the principal causal agent of acidosis or has a worsening clinical condition and accelerates acidosis development effect. Reference 1.

P494 Epidemiology and nature of adverse events in the ICU S Ouerghi1, S Frikha2, K Moncer2, T 13(Suppl 1): P494 (doi: 10.1186/cc7658) Introduction Critically ill patients require high-intensity care may be at especially high risk of iatrogenic injury because they are severely ill [1]. We sought to study the incidence and nature of adverse events in the critical care setting. Methods We conducted a prospective 6-month observational study in a medicosurgical ICU. We included patients whose length of stay was >24 hours. Reporters were asked to provide the identification of the adverse events, date and time, and details with regard to the risk factors. The morbi-mortality was also recorded. Results A total of 250 patients were admitted to the ICU during an observation period, 102 were included. The incidence of adverse events was 59.8%. We found 222 adverse events (2.2 adverse events per patient). The most common adverse events as categorized by organ systems were metabolic (52%), cardio- vascular, respiratory and finally infectious. Among all adverse events, only hyperglycaemia and hypoglycaemia were considered to be iatrogenic adverse events. No association was observed between adverse events and mortality. Conclusions We found that the incidence of adverse events was 59.8%. Some prior critical care safety studies have identified fewer adverse events than this one (3 to 37%) [2]. This difference may have occurred because methods are not standardized; important differences refer to the definitions of the concept of iatrogenic, modes of assessment (prospective, retrospective or transversal), population size, and the observation period. The high incidence of adverse events in our study is due to the exhaustive assessment of adverse events. References 1.

All the drugs that were given during the ICU stay were checked for the presence of potential interactions as per thereference manual. DDIs that were detected clinically or throughinvestigations were recorded and also any therapeutic actionstaken for DDIs were noted.Results The study included 400 patients (Table 1). Sixty-four percent ( n= 256) of patients from the study cohort had potential DDI. The total number of potential DDI found in all prescriptionswas 602; however, only in 34% ( n= 208) was DDI actually observed; of which a clinically relevant interaction (requiring drugmodification or other therapeutic intervention) was observed in49.5% (103 of 208). The average number of drugs used perpatients was nine (SD \u00b14) and potential DDIs found per patientwere two (SD \u00b12). The drug interactions were classified into threegroups, minor (55.29%), moderate (23.08%) and major (21.63%)according to the severity of and requirement for drug modification.Conclusions DDIs are common in the ICU population in the presence of polypharmacy, and a substantial proportion of themare clinically relevant. P496 Outcome of patients with metastatic cancer or haematological malignancy in intensive care I Meynaar, S Sleeswijk Visser, L Dawson, P 10.1186/cc7660) Introduction We studied our ICU database to estimate the effect of metastatic cancer and haematological malignancy on hospitalmortality after intensive treatment.Methods The Reinier de Graaf Hospital is a 500-bed nonacademic teaching hospital with a 30-bed dedicated medicaloncology ward supervised by a team of medical oncologists and a10-bed mixed intensivist-led ICU. Data on all patients admitted tothe ICU including illness severity scores, the presence of meta-static cancer or haematological malignancy and hospital mortalityare prospectively collected in the ICU database. We studied thehospital mortality of all consecutive patients in the databaseadmitted from 2004 until 2007 with respect to the presence orabsence of metastatic cancer or haematological malignancy.Results A total of 2,951 patients were admitted in the study period. Patients with metastatic cancer or haematological malig-nancy were older and had higher illness severity scores onadmission to the ICU (Table 1). Not surprisingly, hospital mortalitywas significantly higher in patients with metastatic cancer or haematological malignancy. We performed logistic regressionanalysis to see whether the higher mortality could be explained bythe usual other confounders. After correction for APACHE IIexpected mortality, age, admission type, sepsis and mechanicalventilation, we found however that the presence of metastaticcancer or haematological malignancy independently increases therisk of dying (OR = 1.7 (95% CI = 1.1 to 2.8, P = 0.024)). Conclusions Hospital mortality is higher in patients with metastatic cancer or haematological malignancy than in other patients, evenafter correction for age, APACHE II expected mortality, admissiontype, sepsis and mechanical ventilation. P497 Mortality rate of vasopressor-dependent septic shock from 1997 through 2006 B Afessa, G Schramm, R Kashyap, O Gajic Mayo 1): (doi: introduced interventions including early goal-directed therapy (EGDT) improve the mortality of severesepsis/septic shock. We undertook this study to describe thetrend in the mortality rate of vasopressor-dependent septic shockover a 10 year-period.Methods We used the APACHE III database of our institution to identify patients with septic shock. Patients with an ICU admissiondiagnosis of infection and who were on a vasopressor on the firstICU day were considered to have vasopressor-dependent septicshock. We divided the study period into pre-EGDT (1997 to2000), transit (2001, 2002), and post-EGDT (2003 to 2006). Wecalculated the standardized mortality ratio (SMR) with the 95%confidence interval.Results Of 53,096 admissions, 4,981 (9.4%) had a diagnosis of infection. The hospital mortality rates of the patients with andwithout infection were 21.2% and 9.3%, respectively ( P<0.001). infused in 1,340 (26.9%) of the patients withinfection. The hospital mortality rate of the vasopressor-receivingpatients with infection was 32.4% compared with 17.1% of thosewho did not receive vasopressor ( P<0.001). The SMR of the vasopressor-dependent septic patients was lowest during thepost-EGDT period (Table 1).Available online http://ccforum.com/supplements/13/S1 Table 1 (abstract P495) Demographics of study population Age (mean \u00b1 SD) (years) 61 \u00b1 16.9 Male:female 239:161APACHE II MC/HM no yes P value Number 2,805 146 Mean age 66.1 (16.5) 68.5 (11.5) <0.001Mean APACHE II score 13.6 (7.6) 17.2 (6.8) <0.001APACHE II expected mortality malignancy.

P498 Patients with severe sepsis and solid tumours: outcome and prognostic factors S Pereira, C Dias, S 1): P498 (doi: 10.1186/cc7662) Introduction Admission to the ICU and the appropriate selection of patients improved the treatment and survival rates of criticaloncological patients [1]. Infection is an important complication inthese patients, which frequently leads to acute organ dysfunctionand even death [2,3]. The objective is to evaluate the outcome andprognostic factors in a group of patients with severe sepsis andsolid tumours.Methods A retrospective observational study of collected data in 140 consecutive admissions to the ICU over a 24-month period atour oncological hospital; 108 patients were evaluated, corres-ponding to 140 admissions to the ICU (19.5% of total admissions).Results Age, sex, the underlying disease and tumour stage (TNM classification), type of previous anticancer treatment, performancestatus, severity scores (APACHE II, Simplified Acute PhysiologyScore II, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment), ICU and hospitalmortalities and hospital outcome at 3, 6 and 12 months wereanalysed. The majority were male with median age 64.5 years;26% had head and neck tumours, 21% oesophagus and ventilation, 42% vasopressors, and4% kidney replacement therapy. Decisions to forgo (withhold orwithdraw) life-sustaining therapies were taken in 19% of patients.In the patients with the intention to treat, the ICU and hospitalsurvival rates were 76.5% and 56.3%. Survival rates at 3, 6 and 12months were 97%, 81% and 45%, respectively.Conclusions Severity scores (APACHE II, Simplified Acute Physiology Score II, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment) in thefirst 24 hours did not discriminate clearly between survivors andnonsurvivors [1]. Mortality for cancer patients with severe sepsisturned out to be unrelated to age [4]. Clinical judgment betweenoncologists and intensive care physicians is necessary to improvethe selection of patients who might benefit from intensive care [5].Long-term survival is predicted by cancer disease-prognostic factors.References1.

P499 Evolution of acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome mortality in an ICU in Southern Brazil L Fialkow, M Farenzena, S Vieira, M Introduction Acute lung injury (ALI), including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), mortality rates are high despiteadvances in the management of patients with this condition. Our objectives were to compare the ALI/ARDS mortality rates and theALI mortality risk factors between two cohort studies of the sameICU in different periods of time: 1999/2000 (2000 cohort [1]) and2004/2007 (2007 cohort).Methods A prospective cohort that included 1,115 patients admitted to the ICU between April 2004 and April 2007 whoneeded mechanical ventilation for at least 24 hours. These resultswere compared with a previous cohort of 1,301 patients admittedto the same ICU between April 1999 and April 2000 [1]. In bothstudies all patients were evaluated regarding the presence/development of ALI/ARDS according to the 1994 American-European Consensus Conference. Data were compared betweenthe two cohorts using Student's tor chi square tests. Multivariate analysis by conditional logistic regression was used to identify ALImortality risk factors.Results In ALI patients ( n= 50, 2000 cohort; n= 347, 2007 cohort) we observed: (i) an increase in both hospital mortality (from50 to 67%, P = 0.02) and ICU mortality (from 44 to 63%, P= 0.01); (ii) a higher mean (\u00b1SD) APACHE II score (from 17.7 \u00b1 6.5 to 23.7 \u00b1 8.2, P <0.001), and (iii) an increased percentage of patients with three or more organ failures (from 30 to 42%,P<0.001). Regarding ARDS patients ( n= 30, 2000 cohort; n= 307, 2007 cohort), there were an increase in hospital mortality (from 47% to 68%, P = 0.03), in the mean (\u00b1SD) APACHE II score (from 17.6 \u00b1 6.9 to 23.6 \u00b1 8.3, P <0.001) and in medical patients (from 46 to 73%, P = 0.01). The factors independently associated with increased hospital mortality in ALI patients wererenal ( P= 0.002) and hematological ( P= 0.02) failures in the 2000 cohort. In the 2007 cohort, renal ( P= 0.01) and hematological (P= 0.02) failures, use of vasoactive drugs ( P<0.001) and ICU length of stay ( P<0.001) were independently associated with mortality.Conclusions We observed an increase in the mortality rates of patients with ALI/ARDS, which are more severely ill. Renal andhematological failures remained independently associated withmortality in these patients. The results suggest that ALI/ARDSpatients in our ICU have more severe illness, what could explainthe increase in the mortality rates, highlighting the relevance of abetter understanding of such findings.Reference1.

Wecaptured data on age, sex, admission category, APACHE IIpredicted mortality, duration of ICU stay, and hospital mortality.Statistical analysis was conducted with SPSS version 15.0 usingCritical Care March 2009 Vol 13 Suppl 1 29th International Symposium on Intensive Care and Emergency MedicineS201logistical regression models. To investigate trends in mortality independent of demographic changes in the ICU population, expected deaths based on the age-sex mortality experience across the whole 12-year period were calculated for each year. Expected mortality rates based on APACHE II probability of death scores were also calculated for each year. Results In total 7,158 patients were included in this study. There was no significant trend in median age across the 12 years studied; however, there has been a steady increase in the proportion of ICU patients over the age of 80. In 1996, 6% were over 80 years old and by 2008 it was 12.5%. There was no significant trend in the sex distribution of ICU patients (60:40 male to female). The LOS for medical and emergency surgical patients is similar, with an average of 6 days. However, the LOS of elective surgical patients has increased from around 3 to 4 days. The median APACHE II probability of death for ICU patients increased over the period, the significant linear trend ( P = 0.001, logistic regression) showing an increase of almost 1% per year. The hospital mortality over the study period was 20%. During this period mortality rates rose in correlation with predicted mortality, before starting a downward trend in 2003 to eventually fall below APACHE II predicted levels in 2007. Conclusions The average age of ICU admissions is not signifi- cantly increasing over time. However, the proportion of patients aged over 80 has almost doubled to 12.5%. The severity of illness has increased and this is seen across all categories of admission, but seems to be due particularly to an increase in the subgroup of over 80 year olds. There has been no consistent change in mortality rates over the 12-year period. P501 Clinical characteristics and prognostic factors of severe acute pancreatitis B Kostadinovska, MS Sosolceva City Surgical Clinic 'St P501 (doi: 10.1186/cc7665) Introduction The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical characteristics and prognostic factors of a consecutive series of patients with severe acute pancreatitis (SAP). SAP is charac- terized by high morbidity and mortality. Methods Clinical data of SAP patients admitted to our hospital from January 2006 to January 2008 were retrospectively reviewed. Collected data included the age, gender, etiology, length of hospitalization, APACHE II score at admission, local and organ/ systemic complications of the patients. Results Of the 125 acute pancreatitis patients, 42 developed SAP [1]. The mean age of SAP patients was 57 years, male/female 22/20 patients, the commonest etiology was cholelitiasis (43.5%), the mean length of hospitalization was 60 days, the mean score of APACHE II was 8.1. Fifty-seven percent of the patients developed necrosis, 23% abscessus, 11% pseudocyst. Fifty-eight percent developed organ/systemic failure. A total of 25.2% (11/42) of the SAP patients died. Respiratory failure was the most common organ dysfunction (90.0%) in deceased SAP patients, follow by cardiovascular failure (86.4%), and renal failure (50.0%). In the SAP patients, 90.9% (9/11) developed multiple organ/systemic failures. There were significant differences in age, length of hospitalization, APACHE II score and incidences of respiratory failure, cardiovascular failure, renal failure between deceased SAP patients and surviving SAP patients [2]. By multivariate logistic regression analysis, the independent prognostic factors for mortality were respiratory failure, cardiovascular failure and renal failure.Conclusions SAP patients are characterized by advanced age, high APACHE II score and organ failure, and their death is mainly due to multiple organ/systemic failures. In patients with SAP, respiratory, cardiovascular and renal failure can predict the fatal outcome and more attention must be paid to their clinical evaluation. References 1.

P502 ICU admittance prediction organ dysfunction clustering E Esprooz, F Sacco, G Testa, RA De Blasi Sant'Andrea Hospital, Italy Critical Care 2009, 13(Suppl 1): P502 (doi: 10.1186/cc7666) Introduction O rgan dysfunction is usually evaluated by gravity scores (Logistic Organ Dysfunction Score, Multi-Organ Dys- function Score and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment), aimed to predict the patient's hospital outcome [1,2]. Despite their diffusion, these scores do not provide indications about the treatment's efficacy for each patient. Our aim was to utilize the previous organ dysfunction scores to perform early strategies to preserve organ function. This study tested the following hypo- thesis: first, that the previous organ dysfunction scores can detect clustering of organ dysfunctions; second, that each clustering could have an own sequence; and, finally, that we can develop a model to predict from the scores at ICU admittance the organ dysfunctions after the seventh day.Available online http://ccforum.com/supplements/13/S1 Table 1 (abstract P502) Percentage error of model prediction for each organ Organ % Liver 18 Heart 14 Kidney 17 Lung 12 Haematic 12 Nervous 5 Figure 1 (abstract P502) S202Methods We retrospectively collected scores, at admission and daily for 6 days, of 85 ICU patients admitted in a 6-month period at Sant'Andrea University Hospital of Rome, Italy. The inclusion criteria were: at least two organ dysfunctions measured by one of the three scores and ICU stay 24 hours. Data were processed by cluster analysis (VARCLUS di SAS System). We used a discriminant linear model for the prediction of organ dysfunction. Resu lts The results are reported in Table 1 and Figure 1. The scores we used detect three clusters of organ dysfunction characterized by a different outcome. The model we elaborate allows one to predict with great accuracy the organ dysfunction over time.

Methods In a cohort study at a tertiary-care nontrauma medical- surgical ICU, we included all ICU admissions (May 2007 to February 2008) from a prospectively collected ICU database. Patients' gender, age, admission physiologic measurements, lactic acid, and APACHE IV score were noted. Outcome was acute phase death (death within 3 days of admission) and inhospital death. Outcome was stratified by the initial serum lactic acid level in three groups: low, 0.0 to 2.0; intermediate, 2.1 to 3.9; high, 4.0 mmol/l or above. Results Total of 882 patients were included in the study, acute phase death rates were 2.5%, in the low group, 5.1% in inter- mediate group and 8.1% in the high group, whereas inhospital mortality rates were 13.9%, 28.6%, and 38.7%, respectively. Acute-phase deaths and inhospital linearly with lactate. An initial lactate 4.0 mmol/l was associated with at least a threefold higher odds ratio for both acute-phase deaths 2.8 (95% CI = 1.1 to 7.3) and inhospital mortality 3.4 (95% CI = 2.0 to 5.8). Conclusions An initial lactate 4.0 mmol/l substantially increases the probability of acute-phase death and inhospital mortality in critically ill patients. P504 APACHE II score may predict mortality in burns patients R Martynoga, M Fried St John's Hospital, Livingston, UK Critical Care 2009, 13(Suppl 1): P504 (doi: 10.1186/cc7668) Introduction The APACHE II scoring system has not been validated in burn injuries. The validation studies were performed in the general and cardiac ICUs of teaching hospitals in the USA; units that did not admit burn injuries [1]. We correlated knownpredictors of mortality in burns (age, percentage total burn surface area (%TBSA), inhalation injury) [2,3] with mortality data in our burns cohort. This was repeated for the APACHE II score to investigate its predictive value. Methods We identified all patients with burns admitted to our ICU, linked to the South East Scotland Regional Burns Unit, from 1995 to 2005. Demographic data and APACHE II score at 24 hours were found on the ICU database. The case notes for each patient were reviewed to verify the %TBSA and survival. Results The cohort comprised 100 patients: 75% male. The age range was 14 to 87 years (mean 45.2; median 45). Injury severity was assessed by %TBSA: range 0 to 99% (mean 23.8%, median 16%, IQR = 8.6 to 30%). Zero %TBSA is inhalation injury only. APACHE II scores ranged from 7 to 42 (mean 15.9, median 15, IQR = 10 to 19.5). The apparent fall in mortality at scores 27 to 31 is due to low numbers ( n= 3) in this group. Both the %TBSA and APACHE II score correlate with increasing mortality (Figure 1). Stepwise logistic regression analysis was performed: %TBSA and APACHE II score both behaved as independent predictors of mortality ( P<0.0001), as did age ( P = 0.002). This cohort behaves as other published data [2,3]. Conclusions Scoring systems with applicability to all critically ill patients provide a standardised objective assessment tool allowing comparison between groups, and can inform clinical decision- making. The strong correlation shown between APACHE II score and mortality provides evidence for the utility of APACHE II scoring in critically ill patients with burn injuries. References 1.

P505 Scoring systems (APACHE II and Simplified Acute Physiology Score II) for predicting outcome in status asthmaticus A Hachimi, B Charra, A Benslama, S Motaouakkil 13(Suppl 1): P505 (doi: 10.1186/cc7669) Introduction The scoring systems (SS) can be used globally to estimate the severity of critically ill patients. In status asthmaticus (SA), these SS were not evaluated to predict mortality. Our aim isCritical Care March 2009 Vol 13 Suppl 1 29th International Symposium on Intensive Care and Emergency Medicine Figure 1 (abstract P504) S203to evaluate the ability of nonspecific scores (APACHE II and Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS) II) to predict outcomein SA in a medical ICU.Methods A prospective and monocentric study during 8 years (2000 to 2007) included all patients who were admitted to our unitfor SA. Demographic and clinical data were collected at admission.We collected also therapeutic aspects in all patients. Daily, a follow-up of the SS value was calculated with their average. We defined asubgroup that has been mechanically ventilated to evaluate the valueof SS in SA, because mechanical ventilation is a main prognosticfactor among others. Modulus evaluation required a discriminativeapplication using receiver operating characteristic curves. Thestatistic analysis has been based on SPSS 11.0 for windows.Results A total of 246 cases of SA (9.7% of all patients admitted in our unit) have been counted during the duration of study. Themean value of APACHE II and of SAPS II was 8 \u00b1 5 and 20 \u00b1 10,respectively. The mortality rate was 12%. In the subgroup, 90% ofpatients had APACHE II score 8 and 77% of them had SAPS II <20. Both scoring systems had a weak discrimination, with an areaunder the curve (receiver operating characteristic) 0.655 and0.557 for SAPS II and APACHE II, respectively.Conclusions APACHE II and SAPS II are not good prognostic tools for status asthmaticus. A new and more adapted evaluationtool is required. P506 Is Simplified Acute Physiology Score 3 better than APACHE II to predict mortality in transplanted critical patients? VO The performance of general prognostic models in patients with transplantation in need for ICU admission is poor,showing a tendency towards significant underestimation of the riskof dying. The objective of our study is to evaluate the APACHE IIscore and Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS) 3 and their90-day mortality prediction after liver, renal and pulmonarytransplantation.Methods A prospective cohort study in a transplantation ICU in Porto Alegre, Brazil, during the period May 2006 to July 2007.Clinical data of 277 post-transplantation patients admitted to theICU were collected at admission and the SAPS 3 and APACHE IIscore calculated with respective estimated mortality rates. Thearea under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC)was obtained for both scores.Results Patients enrolled included 172 men and 105 women, with mean age 45 \u00b1 2 years. There were 86 (31%) liver transplanta-tions, 170 renal transplantations and 21 12 (15.4%), four (3%) and four(26.3%). The mean SAPS 3 score was 40 \u00b1 10.2, 21 \u00b1 5.8 and63 \u00b1 19, and the APACHE II score was 25 \u00b1 8.2, 16 \u00b1 5.9 and17 \u00b1 21.4, respectively. Comparing the AUROC from both scoreswe observed: in liver transplantation the AUROC SAPS CI = 0.623to APACHE transplantation the AUROC 3 was -0.619 (95% CI = 0.604(95% CI 0.355 to 0.882) APACHE II; in trans-plantation the for SAPS 3 (95% 0.805to 1.06) versus 0.750 (95% CI = 0.489 to 1.01) for APACHE II.Conclusions In these preliminary results, no differences were observed comparing SAPS 3 and APACHE II in the mortalityprediction from liver, renal and pulmonary transplanted patients.References1.

P507 Inter-rater reliability of APACHE II scores in the medical ICU X Hu, L Weng, J Peng, D Yu, B Du Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Beijing, ChinaCritical Care 2009, 13(Suppl 1): P507 (doi: 10.1186/cc7671) Introduction The aim of this study was to determine inter-rater reliability of APACHE II scores between an ICU specialist and awell-trained ICU fellow.Methods In a prospective observational study, two raters collect APACHE II scores on 50 consecutive patients in a medical ICUrespectively. Intraclass correlation coefficients were calculated forthe APACHE II total score, the APACHE II component scores, andthe Glasgow coma scale components. Concordance correlationcoefficients for each chosen value of the APACHE II componentwere assessed.Results Mean (standard deviation) APACHE II scores were 21.6 (8.2) for the specialist, and 21.7 (7.1) for the fellow. The intraclasscorrelation coefficient was 0.848 for the APACHE II total score.Within the score components, the inter-rater reliabilities of acutephysiology score, age, and chronic health evaluation were 0.860,0.987, and 0.645, respectively. See Table 1. Further analysis ofeach chosen value of the APACHE II component found the lowestreliability for the mean artery pressure, which was 0.482. Furtherinvestigation discovered that the most common reason for inter-rater difference is data dropout. Table 1 (abstract P507) Overall agreement Items Interclass correlation coefficient APACHE II score 0.848 Acute physiology score 0.860Age 0.987Chronic health evaluation 0.645 Conclusions The agreements of the APACHE II score among the two collectors was good, but there were more differences incollecting the value of mean artery pressure, for which the originaldata could not be read directly from medical chart. P508 Validation of Simplified Acute Physiology Score II and Simplified Acute Physiology Score III as mortality and morbidity risk models F Franchi, L Cubattoli, P Mongelli, C Porciani, M (doi: Introduction Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS) II and SAPS III are valuable scoring systems used to predict the risk ofmortality in the ICU. The main purposes of this study were toassess the strength of both the scores in predicting the mortalityAvailable online http://ccforum.com/supplements/13/S1S204risk, to check which one gained the best performance, and to ascertain whether they also achieved a good level of morbidity risk prediction in our patient population. Methods Two hundred and forty-one patients (82 female, 159 male, mean age 53 \u00b1 23), out of 393 admitted to our ICU over 12 months, were included in the study. Exclusion criteria were age <18, and ICU stay <24 hours. SAPS II and SAPS III were prospectively collected. The derived probability of death was calculated according to the original descriptions. To evaluate the capability of morbidity risk prediction of these scoring models, the GIVITI definitions (Italian Group for the Evaluation of Interventions in the ICU) of organ dysfunction and failure were used. Univariate and multivariate analyses were applied. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was calculated. Results Median values for SAPS II and SAPS III were 35 and 58, respectively. Mortality and morbidity rates resulted 16% and 40.5%, respectively. The mean ICU stay was 9 \u00b1 10 days. Although the univariate analysis found similar statistical signifi- cances ( P<0.001) for both the scores, at the multivariate analysis only SAPS II maintained a statistical significance ( P<0.001) in predicting the probability of death. Moreover, SAPS II showed a significantly higher AUC (0.91 vs. 0.73, SAPS II vs. SAPS III, respectively, P<0.05). With respect to morbidity, the AUC of both the scores gained a poor level of predictive power (AUCs = 0.618 and 0.605, SAPS II and SAPS III, respectively). However, in the subgroup of patients admitted to our ICU for major trauma (41% of patients), SAPS III reached a high degree of discriminative strength in predicting the morbidity rate (AUC = 0.81, P<0.01). Conclusions SAPS II seemed a suitable tool in predicting the risk of death, but not morbidity. Conversely, SAPS III, even though it did not gain a sufficient degree of predictive power toward mortality, could be a useful morbidity risk model when applied to major trauma patients. In our ICU, SAPS II and SAPS III are not interchangeable, but they should be carefully used in the right circumstances. This might avoid the pitfalls leading to errors in forecasting mortality and morbidity risk. P509 Performance of the APACHE IV system in patients with acute renal failure T Dahhan, I Al-Sanouri, H Al-Awadhi, M Jamil, M Kherallah King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia Critical Care 2009, 13(Suppl 1): P509 (doi: 10.1186/cc7673) Introduction Scoring systems represent classification systems or point systems that have been designed for making quantitative statements regarding the severity of a disease, its course and its prognosis [1]. These systems are based on physiologic abnor- malities and have been successful in measuring severity of illness among critically ill patients [2]. The APACHE IV system has already been validated in our population at King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center [3], and the purpose of this study is to evaluate the performance of this system in a subset of patients with acute renal failure. Methods Fifty-four consecutive patients with acute renal failure defined as a creatinine value 1.5 mg/dl and urine output <410 ml/24 hours were admitted to a medical/surgical ICU between January 2007 and March 2008 and were enrolled in the study. The length of stay and mortality percentages were predicted using APACHE IV, and both variables were compared with the observed data. The Wilcoxon rank sum test is used to calculate statistical significance for continuous data and the chi-square test for categorical data.Results A total of 54 patients with mean age of 53.8 years were included. Fifty-six percent were males; 62% of patients were medical, 38% were surgical. The predicted ICU length of stay of 6.3 days (SD = 2, range of 2.1 to 10.2) was insignificantly lower than the observed ICU length of stay of 8.0 days (SD = 8.5, range of 1 to 45) ( P<0.12: Wilcoxon test for nonparametric) (Figure 1). The observed mortality of 44.4% was not statistically different from predicted mortality of 42.1 ( 2= 0.07, P= 0.8) (Figure 2). The standardized mortality ratio is 1.06 ( P= 0.79, 95% CI = 0.7 to 1.5). Conclusions The APACHE IV predicted mortality and length of stay equations perform well in a subset of patients with acute renal failure in our population. References 1.

Due to substantial advancement in critical care, a new cohort was studied recently and APACHE IV was derived for benchmarking ICU performance. The objective of the study is to compare APACHE II with APACHE IV outcome prediction in the same cohort of critically ill population. Methods The study was carried out in a 40-bed mixed medical- surgical, adult, semiclosed ICU at a tertiary-care centre. All consecutive patients from January 2007 to October 2008 were studied. Patient demography was recorded. APACHE II and APACHE IV scores were calculated on each patient and statistical comparison was performed. Results During the study period the total ICU admission was 3,647 patients. Patients with limitation of life support and discharge against medical advice were excluded. Cases where data were incomplete were also excluded, and 2,919 patients were finally analyzed. The median APACHE II and APACHE IV scores of the study cohort were 12 (8 to 18) and 44 (30 to 62). The median predicted mortality over the study period was significantly higher with APACHE II scoring in comparison with APACHE IV (15 (8 to 25) vs. 4.6 (1.66 to 12.67)) ( P = 0.00001). The standardized mortality ratio was likewise significantly lower with APACHE II in comparison with APACHE IV (median = -0.87 vs. 2.85, mean = -1.13 vs. 8.18) (Figure 1) ( P= 0.00001). Conclusions Currently, APACHE II benchmarking overestimates ICU performance and APACHE IV might be more relevant tool to estimate ICU performance. P511 Validation of the APACHE IV scoring system in patients with severe sepsis and comparison with the APACHE II system T Dahhan, M Jamil, A Al-Tarifi, N Abouchala, M Kherallah King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia Critical Care 2009, 13(Suppl 1): P511 (doi: 10.1186/cc7675) Introduction APACHE IV is a successful scoring system assessing severity of illness and prognosis of ICU patients [1]. It has been evaluated and validated in our patients for mortality outcome [2]. The objective of this study was to validate the APACHE IV benchmark for patients admitted with severe sepsisand septic shock to the ICU and to compare the performance of the APACHE IV system with APACHE II. Methods In a cohort study at a tertiary-care medical-surgical ICU with a total of 35 acute-care beds, we included all ICU patients with the diagnosis of severe sepsis and septic shock between 1 January 2007 and 29 February 2008 from a prospectively collected ICU database. Observed mortality rates were compared with predicted mortality rates for both the APACHE II and APACHE IV scoring systems, and standardized mortality ratios (SMR) were determined. The mortality percentages were predicted using the APACHE IV system and were compared with the observed data. The chi-square test is used to calculate statistical significance for categorical data. Results One hundred and seventy-two patients were included in the study with an average age of 48.9 years, 53% of patients were males and 47% were females with observed mortality of 33.1%. The average APACHE II score was 20.7 with predicted mortality of 39.9% and SMR 0.83 (95% CI = 0.63 to 1.06, P= 0.15) compared with an average APACHE IV score of 73.1 with predicted mortality of 32.2% and SMR of 0.99 (95% CI = 0.78 to 1.32, P= 0.82) (Figure 1). The hospital mortality calibration curve for APACHE IV shows good calibration, with the line of perfect fit agreement lying within the 95% CI for all the risk ranges. Pvalues of more than 0.05 in all risk ranges confirm adequate calibration. Although the curve shows that observed mortality differs from expected in the ranges of 20 to 40%, there is no statistical significance for its deviations from perfect fit (Figure 2).Available online http://ccforum.com/supplements/13/S1 Figure 1 (abstract P510) A2 SMR, APACHE II standardized mortality rate; A4 SMR, APACHE IV standardized mortality rate.

P512 Prolonged intensive care stay and subsequent psychological distress: a study in cardiac patients M Screaton, L Sharples, A Vuylsteke P512 (doi: 10.1186/cc7676) Introduction The study aim was to determine whether patients who stay in the ICU for >24 hours after cardiac surgery developpersisting psychological symptoms.Methods After Institutional Review Board and Local Research Ethics Committee approval, we approached consecutive patientswho underwent first-time coronary artery bypass graft surgery withICU stay >24 hours (long stay group (LS)). For each LS patient,we recruited a short stay (SS) patient with <24 hours ICU stay,matched by age and sex. Patients with known psychologicaldisorder or previous ICU admission were excluded. At 3, 6 and12 months following hospital discharge, patients completed fourpsychological questionnaires: Experience after Treatment inIntensive Care 7 Item Scale (ECTI-7), Hospital Anxiety andDepression (HAD), using SPSS. PreoperativeEuroScore and left ventricular function were included to adjust forbaseline disease severity.Results We studied 302 paired patients. Table 1 presents the mean differences and significance level between LS and SSgroups for each questionnaire (HAD components anxiety 1 anddepression 2, SF-36 components physical 3 and mental 4,TSC-33). Patients who stayed >24 hours in ICU had significantlypoorer scores on all scales up to 12 months post surgery, evenwhen adjusted for baseline disease severity.Conclusions Patients who stayed in the ICU for >24 hours post cardiac surgery scored higher on several psychological evaluationquestionnaires when compared with patients who stayed<24 hours. This indicates the possibility of greater psychologicaldistress for at least 12 months after cardiac surgery.

Logistic regression modeling for prognosis in the ICUis still the current standard. This study examines the possibility ofthe clinical use of classification trees for mortality prediction inpatients with haematological malignancies admitted to the ICU.Recently, new modeling tools based on classification treealgorithms have become available [1,2]. These new modeling toolshave proven to be accurate and robust in domain applicationsoutside the clinical setting. Moreover, classification tree modelscan be constructed easily by the ICU clinician and have the advan-tages over logistic regression to give a clear insight into the data.Methods Three hundred and fifty-two patients with haematological malignancies that were admitted to the ICU between 1997 and2006 for a life-threatening complication were included. Twohundred and fifty-two patient records were used for training of themodels and 100 were used for validation. In a first model 12 inputvariables were included, and in a second more complex model 17input variables were used for model development. These twomodels were consecutively constructed using Classification andRegres sion Tree (CART \u00ae), Multivariate Adaptive Forests (RF) and TREENET software (Salford Systems, San Diego, CA, USA). Discrimination was evaluatedusing the area under the receiver operating characteristic curves(\u00b1SE). All results were then compared with the results obtained bya logistic regression model.Results The area under the receiver operating characteristic curves in the validation datasets for the decision tree andsmoothing splines analyses were RF and TREENET, respectively. Conclusions The present study stands as a proof of concept for the use of classification tree algorithms for mortality prediction inan ICU setting.References1.

Methods One hundred and twenty-one patients were admitted to an emergency department ICU in 2007 with major trauma (injury severity score >15) and severe to moderate brain injury (Glasgow coma scale <13). Of these, 25 died in the days following trauma. Thirty-four of these were evaluated, during the follow-up visit, 6 months after discharge from the ICU. HRQL was assessed by the SF-36 questionnaire. At admission to the ICU, from the ICU database (FileMaker Pro 5.5v2; FileMaker, Inc., USA) with authorization of the Careggi Teaching Hospital Committee of the Emergency Department, the following parameters were collected for every patient: age, sex, abbreviated injury scale, injury severity score, Simplified Acute Physiology Score II, in the field Glasgow coma scale, Marshall score at the first head CT, worst values of lactates and ScvO2within 24 hours from trauma. Also, the length of sedation and ICU stay were collected. The mean summarized SF-36 was related with the Pearson test to the other parameters. Results Only lactate levels showed a significant correlation with the mean summarized Conclusions In the patients affected by major trauma and brain traumatic injury, the HRQL appears to be related to the severity of the clinical picture on the first day of trauma assessed by lactate levels regardless of the length of ICU stay and sedation.

Short-term effects of ICU treatment have been well documented, but this is the first study to describe the long-term effect in a large cohort after surgical ICU admission on survival. Methods Of all surgical patients admitted to the ICU of a single hospital between 1995 and 2000, patient characteristics, disease category, APACHE II score and survival were prospectively registered. A continuous follow up until 6 to 11 years after discharge was achieved. Results Of the 1,822 patients included, 936 (51%) had died. Fifty- two patients were lost to follow up. Overall ICU and inhospital mortalities were 11% and 16%. Age, gender, APACHE II score and surgical diagnosis were independently associated with long-term survival. Mortality increased with age of admittance to the ICU, whereas female patients had a lower chance of dying (Figure 1). Long-term mortality rates in various surgical diagnostic groups varied between 29% for trauma and 70% for oncological patients. In gas- trointestinal, oncological, general surgical and/or high-aged patients this negative effect even exceeds 5 years. In general, 10 years after ICU discharge the survival was only 50%. The mortality ratio was increased twofold in comparison with the general population. Conclusions Survival after ICU treatment follows distinct patterns in which age, gender, surgical diagnosis and APACHE II score are independent determinants. A negative effect of an ICU stay appears to be long lasting.Available online http://ccforum.com/supplements/13/S1 Figure 1 (abstract P515) S208P516 Quality of life 1 year after intensive care A Zidkov\u00e1, I Chytra, B est\u00e1kov\u00e1, E Kasal 1): P516 (doi: 10.1186/cc7680) Introduction The aim of our study was the comparison of quality of life before admission to the ICU and 1 year after the dischargefrom ICU.Methods Quality of life was examined in patients admitted to the interdisciplinary ICU of a university hospital from January 2000 toDecember 2004 for more than 3 days. The EuroQoL-5D and StateTrait Anxiety Inventory questionnaires were used for the evaluationof quality of life, anxiety and psychological outcome. The Wilcoxonsigned-rank test and the chi-square test were used accordingly;P<0.05 was considered statistically significant. Stepwise multiple logistic regression analysis was performed to evaluate thedependence of quality of life after the discharge on the followingassessed parameters: age, severity of the state at the time of ICUadmission, length of ICU and hospital stay, length of mechanicalventilation, extent of organ dysfunction during ICU stay, andprevious quality of life. The study was approved by the hospitalethical committee.Results Questionnaires were sent by mail to 483 patients, and 194 patients answered (41.16%). One year after discharge fromthe ICU, 39 (20.1%) patients were less mobile, 56 (28.9%) hadworse quality of self-care, 76 (39.2%) of patients complained of alower level of normal daily activities, 87 (44.8%) of patientssuffered from a higher level of pain and 58 (29.9%) of patientsperceived a higher degree of anxiety. Significant elevation ofanxiety for both women and men (22.3% and 19.3% respectively)was found by the State Trait Anxiety Inventory questionnaire. All ofthe above mentioned changes were significant ( P <0.0001). A stepwise multiple logistic regression identified age (OR = 1.03,95% CI = 1.004 to 1.059; P = 0.025), length of stay (OR = 1.06 95% CI = 1.02 to 1.10; P = 0.008), length of mechanical ventilation (OR = 1.05, 95% CI = 1.01 to 1.09; P = 0.017), and level of pain (OR = 8.92, 95% CI = 1.14 to 69.64; P = 0.037) and anxiety (OR = 1.04, 95% CI = 1.00 to 1.08; P = 0.048) before admission to the ICU as independent predictors of worsening ofquality of life 1 year after the discharge.Conclusions One year after the discharge from the ICU, patients suffered from deterioration in all aspects of quality of life evaluatedby the questionnaires used. Quality of life 1 year after thedischarge from intensive care was influenced by its previous level,by the age, by the length of stay and by the length of mechanicalventilation.Acknowledgement Supported by the research project MSM0021620819.

Elderlypatients recovering from critical illness may show reduced health-related quality of life (HRQOL) [1]. We studied the impact of ICU stay on HRQOL of octogenarians, and compared their HRQOLwith the same age-matched general population.Methods We performed a long-term prospective study in a medical-surgical ICU. Patients 80 years ( n= 129) admitted for >48 hours were included. We used the Short-Form 36 (SF-36) toevaluate HRQOL before ICU admission (using proxies), at ICUdischarge and at hospital discharge and at 3, 6 and 12 monthsfollowing ICU discharge. Furthermore we compared HRQOLbefore ICU admission and 12 months after ICU discharge withthose of an age-matched general Dutch population. The Wilcoxonsigned rank test was used for evaluating changes between twotime points. To analyze individual changes over time, a MANOVAtest was used, with Wilks' lambda as the multivariate test.Results Mortality was considerable in the 129 included octogenarians. Patients could be evaluated 6 months ( n= 48) and 12 months ( n= 27) after ICU discharge (11 patients were lost to follow-up, 70 patients died). All SF-36 dimensions changedsignificantly over time (all P<0.001), with the exception of the role- emotional dimension. However, after an initial drop, HRQOLrecovered to pre-ICU levels in all dimensions. The physicalcomponent scores changed significantly over time (all P<0.001), whereas the mental component scores showed only a modestdecline at ICU discharge but recovered rapidly and had improvedto higher than baseline values with longer follow-up to 12 monthsafter ICU discharge. The pre-admission HRQOL in survivingoctogenarians was already lower when compared with the age-matched general population and remained so at 12 months afterICU discharge.Conclusions Critically ill octogenarians demonstrate a sharp decline of HRQOL during the ICU stay and a gradual improvementduring the 6 months and 12 months following ICU discharge tobaseline values. Recovery begins following ICU discharge to thegeneral ward. This implies that intensive care treatment in patients80 years is worthwhile. Reference1.

Our aim was to assess morbidity (physical andpsychological) and health-related quality of life (HRQL) in patientsdischarged from the ICU.Methods A longitudinal prospective and descriptive study of patients discharged from the ICU. They were interviewed at 3, 6and 12 months at an outpatient clinic. Assessment of physicalmorbidity was performed each time, as well as Folstein's MiniMental State Examination (MMSE) for cognitive evaluation, Barthelindex and Short-Form 36 version 2 (SF-36) to evaluate functionalactivity and HRQL.Results We included 132 patients (13 with less than 1 year of follow-up); mean \u00b1 SD age 37 \u00b1 17 years.

Causes of admission: neurologic 59, septic 27, trauma 18. Required mechanical ventilation, 107 (81%)patients. In the first interview 130 patients were at home. A yearafter discharge, 90 patients survived, three died and 26 were lostto follow up. At first control 22 patients had dysphonia, six trachealstenosis and eight swallowing-related problems; pressure ulcers,16 patients. Four were aphasics, 50 with muscle weakness,paralysis or numbness. In 46 patients, psychological disorderswere diagnosed; 32 anxiety/depression, 14 sleep disorders. Sixty-five patients had a previous job, only 14 (21%) returned to work at3 months, rising to 22 (34%) at 1 year. Only 13 patients had aMMSE with a cutoff point <27. The SF-36 showed better results inall areas in patients with 10 days stay, being significant for physical function. Higher physical dependence was associatedwith worse perception of health and quality of life. Comparing SF-36 dimensions at 3, 6 and 12 months, better results wereobtained in most of them. Longitudinal analysis of the Barthel indexshowed at 1 year that most patients were low dependent orindependent.Conclusions Follow-up of critically ill patients after discharge allows us to identify common physical and psychological problems.The results showed worse HRQL perception in patients withlonger stays. A year after discharge, most patients showed a greatimprovement in HRQL perception and lower physical dependencylevels.Reference1. Griffith R, "}
