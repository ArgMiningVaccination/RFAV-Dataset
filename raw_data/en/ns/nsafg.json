New Offerings by Established Practitioners and Businesses Alice Brown Gagnon, Licensed Professional Counselor, started a part-time private practice, The Core Healing Counseling Center, after the economic crash closed her practice in Plymouth. She is now counseling full-time in her space above the People's Food Co-op in downtown Ann Arbor. Gagnon specializes in weight loss for life and improving self-esteem. She explained that the two are often interlinked, and that with her clients interested in weight loss she must first spend time healing their self-esteem issues before delving into the small, sustainable behavior change steps that enable long-term weight loss. Gagnon's 2011 book, Radical Self Care for Weight Loss for Life, reflects this process. The first half is devoted to healing the self and the second half is spent on the actual steps to weight loss. Gagnon explained that some of us demand extra food to make up for unmet needs. A major aspect of losing weight and keeping it off permanently, then, is learning to meet our own needs in a healthy way. Gagnon has developed a unique counseling method called Core Beliefs Psychotherapy (CBP), which she explained heals the mistaken core beliefs we hold about ourselves that make us feel inadequate. These core beliefs are developed in childhood, when our undeveloped and very egocentric selves misinterpret anything that goes wrong as our own fault. This causes us to distance ourselves from our real selves and create a \"coping self,\" said Gagnon. CPB can help reverse the mistaken core beliefs that lead to feelings of inadequacy and help us return to our authentic selves rather than our \"coping selves.\" Gagnon emphasized that her counseling style is very gentle and respecting. She actively creates an atmosphere of safety and non-judgment to help her clients feel as comfortable as possible while working on their therapeutic processes. Alice Brown Gagnon can be reached at 734-776-2284 or AnHealer@yahoo.com. Her website is www.core-healing-center.com. Conrad Davillier, a professional photographer since 2001, has begun offering a new service: fairy photography! With two young fairies of his own, daughters Jasmine, age 10, and Christina, age 6, Davillier has perfected the fairy photographing process and is now sharing it with others. Working from his Ypsilanti home studio, where he has a collection of wings and other fairy accouterments, as well as an assortment of props and backgrounds, including plants, a large stump, rocks, and a gazing mirror, he creates a whimsical scene where children can enact the fantasy of being a fairy. A typical fairy photo shoot begins with Davillier's older daughter and part time assistant, Jasmine, answering the door in her full fairy finery. The child to be photographed and her parents can pick out the wings and fairy outfit of choice and then Davillier takes a few test shots. He shows the parents and child a book of fairy poses and backgrounds and the fairy chooses which she would like to do. When the shoot is finished, the fairy and her parents can enjoy fresh-baked cookies. Parents and grandparents have been very enthusiastic about the fairy photos. Davillier hopes to take many more as people become aware of this new specialty. Conrad Davillier's fairy photos can be seen online at www.memoriesbydavillier.com. He can be reached at 734-657-0157. Local professional intuitive Nicole Bedy recently became an Ashati master and is now offering Ashati healing and attunements. Ashati, Bedy explained, is a new healing system developed by Jerome Baudel. It is similar to Reiki in that it offers physical healing, but it is also a complete personal and psychic development system. Bedy, who is also a Reiki master, said that she has found Reiki to be effective for physical and emotional healing, while Ashati has been more effective for mental healing and intuitive development.

What's New in the CommunityThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2013 Page 15 Bedy will be offering a series of classes in Ashati on the last Saturdays of May, June, and July from 11:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. The classes should be taken in order, and a month is given between classes to allow integration of the concepts. The first class, on May 25, will focus on releasing repressed emotions and emotional and mental healing. The second, on June 29, will focus on reconnecting with your soul level and higher mind, linking the heart and solar plexus chakras. The third, on July 27, will focus on healing without using the hands. Bedy explains that the first class will be useful for everyone and helps create self-empowerment. The second and third classes will be more for people interested in pursuing Ashati more deeply for healing and personal development. Bedy has formed a Meetup group called A2/Ypsi Intuitive and Healing Growth to spread the word about some of her offerings and classes. Others will be listed on her website. Bedy also offers energy healing, attunements, chakra readings, and etheric cord cutting by appointment. Nicole Bedy can be reached at 810-941-8842 or Pineriverintuitive@gmail.com. Her website is www.pineriverintuitive.com. Books by Area Authors Lisa Bousson, a psychic medium living in Sterling Heights, has published her first book, The Lessons of Jesus Christ. Bousson is an ordained minister but considers herself spiritual rather than religious. She said that when Jesus appeared to her during meditation for the first time, she was shocked. Over the next couple of years, Jesus continued to appear to her during her daily meditation and shared lessons with her about many areas of life, including healing, goals, self-care, inspiration, and more. She described Jesus as \"a man, a human being, with a sense of humor and a lot of wisdom.\" The Lessons of Jesus Christ contains 86 meditations from Jesus along with explanations by Bousson. According to Bousson, \"There is something for everyone who is seeking knowledge for the path they're traveling.\" Two more books are in the works for Bousson. The first will be a book of affirmations and the second will be part biography, part spiritual teachings. The Lessons of Jesus Christ is published by Balboa Press and is available on Amazon. com and BarnesandNoble.com. Lisa Bousson is online at LisaBousson.com and can be reached at 586-322-3217. Dexter resident and mom of four Nicole Tichy has published her first book, The Wheel of Light Energy: Peace We Have. Tichy said the book is an account of her personal journey to enlightenment that was brought on by a near-death experience 13 years ago. As a 22-year-old University of Michigan student vacationing in the Bahamas, she was in a serious car accident in which she broke her back. She and her friends were \"in the middle of nowhere,\" and Tichy was unresponsive and without a pulse for 30 minutes. When she awoke, her back was broken and her then-boyfriend, in shock, told her she had been dead. All of Tichy's friends in the car were injured and they were without a nearby hospital or help of any kind. Forty minutes after the accident, a car happened by with a husband and wife emergency doctor and neurologist from Boston who were on vacation themselves. Tichy credits the couple for saving her legs and her ability to give birth to her four daughters, as they stabilized her back before moving her. After the accident Tichy began seeing the world differently and she began journaling her process. She felt she had been given a mission when she came back to life, and is now finally ready to share her inner wisdom with others. Tichy explained that the wheel of light energy is part of the universal source of love and light energy, spinning us toward a great shift in awareness for the greater good of humanity. \"We are what we think, say, and do,\" Tichy said, and the choices we make daily shift to negative or positive energy. She explained that there are three parts to people: the physical body, the emotional body, and the spiritual body. Most people, she said, spend their lives shifting between the first two in their awareness. The spiritual body, she explained, is more than just the heart and soul; it is our life mission. Through bringing awareness to our mind, body, and spirit, we discover our divine mission. Tichy said that the people she has shared the message with and coached through the process so far have \"transformed their whole lives.\" Nicole Bedy will be offering a series of classes in Ashati, a complete personal and psychic development system, on the last Saturdays of May, June, and July from 11:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. Lisa Bousson, a psychic medium living in Sterling Heights, has published her first book, The Lessons of Jesus Christ.

Upcoming Events On January 10-19, 2014, Ann Arbor's Naturopathic School of the Healing Arts will bring a group to Belize to study with well-known herbalist Dr. Rosita Arvigo, as well as to meet Mayan medicine men and women, visit the rainforest, and enjoy the beauty and culture of the country. Mary Light, director of the Naturopathic School and an herbalist for 20 years, said she is preparing for a group of 10-12 to share this trip of a lifetime. Dr. Arvigo will teach the group about rainforest herbs and herbal medicine for a full day at her home in Belize. The trip will convey 16 hours of Continuing Education and Training contact hours, potentially applicable to a variety of healthcare providers. For three days and two nights, participants will stay in the San Ignacio area and the Cayo district of Belize, where they will spend one day with Dr. Arvigo, visit a botanical garden, explore a butterfly farm, and learn about native flora. There will be plenty of free time in which travelers can arrange for tours of waterfalls, caves, and Mayan ruins, or can just relax. After leaving the Cayo district, participants will travel by small plane to the rainforest and jungles in the Maya Mountains. They will stay in all-inclusive jungle lodges. Participants can experience: swimming, kayaking, caves, a tour of the organic gardens on the lodge site, study with bush medicine men and women and native botanical healers, native plant study with guided walks, and nighttime jungle walks with a licensed guide to see the jungle animals. There will be ample unscheduled personal time in which to make connections and plan activities other than those scheduled for the trip. For more information and to register for this trip, visit the website at naturopathicschoolofannarbor.net/3/mylinks.htm. The trip is expected to fill up quickly, so early registration is recommended.

Peacef l Crossings\u00ae Intentional Living. Workshops, Seminars, and Coaching For Your Major Life Transitions. Major life transitions bring change and they can sometimes really throw you for a loop.

The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2013 Page 17 Brodsky explained: \"Our workshop focus will be on this question: In a world of suffering, what tools can we develop to help us remain centered in the loving heart; to bring clear, spacious witness, free of reactivity, to the suffering in the world; to attend in appropriate ways, and not add to that suffering?\" The workshop will introduce many such practices and deepen participants' skill and confidence with using them. The program will include basic dharma and meditation, as well as practices with elements, energy, sound, light, Pure Awareness, co-creating with spirit, shamanic journeying, and work within the Akashic field. The days will include talks and instruction from Barbara and other leaders, incorporated spirit (Aaron and other Brothers/Sisters of Light), small group discussions, and exercises to help the student integrate understanding beyond the intellect. Brodsky said, \"Our whole world is moving through a period of transition to higher consciousness and we will evolve into a higher positively or negatively polarized consciousness. If we believe we are limited to the old patterns of reactivity and fear, we'll continue those into this new vibration. If we begin to know our true capacity to live and love from a place of deepest interconnection, this is what we will bring to the world.\" Brodsky has been practicing meditation since 1960 and teaching since 1989. Her teaching draws from dual roots in the Buddhist and Quaker traditions. She became totally deaf in 1972 and says that living with silence has greatly influenced her life and teaching, as have years of active involvement in nonviolent action for social change. Since 1989, Barbara has been the channel for the spirit Aaron and, with him, offers personal spiritual direction sessions and group workshops. She has published eight books containing her and Aaron's teachings. The cost of the workshops is to be determined, and will cover expenses, with an opportunity to give Dana (an expression of generosity from the heart without expectation) to the teacher. Potential participants must apply and be invited to attend.

New Classes Peaceful Crossings, a local company focusing on various life transitions, is offering a new series of workshops called the Intentional Living Series. Owner Callan Loo said that the idea behind these workshops is to help people as they go through the big transitions in life: divorce, marriage, childbirth, rites of passage, aging, grief, and even starting a business. The workshops last for two hours and have a goal for participants to learn enough to be able to navigate their transition on their own. More in-depth seminars and coaching services are also available for those who want to delve deeper. \"Most people are afraid of change,\" Loo said. They don't know what to do, or if they are doing the right thing, or what life will be like after the change. Family and friends may not be able to help them through these challenging times, though they mean well, and therapy continues to carry a social stigma for some. Peaceful Crossings looks to bridge that gap and provide support during times of change. May workshops include Personal Legacy Planning, with Part I on May 8 and Part II on May 29; Organizational Self-Awareness: A Holistic Approach to Business Strategy on May 16; and Using Compassionate Life Review as Part of Your Healing Process on May 30. Personal Legacy Planning, said Loo, is about defining our own legacy rather than letting someone else do it for us after we are gone. \"It's not about death, it's about life,\" he explained. The goal is to decide what is important to us so that we can fill our lives with those things and look back on our lives with satisfaction. Organizational Self-Awareness provides entrepreneurs and small business owners with an introduction to a tangible system to holistically account for your business that is built around a balance sheet, holistic decision making, and a dashboard of metrics. This is part of the \"Business Legacy Fulfillment\" aspect of Peaceful Crossings, which helps business owners to create a business that will not fall apart when they move on to something new or pass away. Compassionate Life Review is a therapeutic approach that can help put one's life into perspective. It can foster connections between the lessons learned, the strengths gathered, and the unique qualities of the self that have been expressed over a lifetime. Using Compassionate Life Review during times of transition can help us process and make peace with change. Other workshops in the series include A Conscious, Unbiased Look at Divorce, A Grail Journey: Quest For Healing, and Personalized Coming of Age Ceremonies. Future dates for these workshops will be announced on the Peaceful Crossings website. Continued on page 18Peaceful Crossings has a full staff of coaches who support clients in the areas of Life Transition, Personal Legacy, and Business Legacy. The company also provides ministry and celebrant services for weddings, coming of age ceremonies, and other important life celebrations. Loo seeks out experts in the community on topics related to life changes and, when possible, has them teach workshops on their areas of expertise. He emphasizes that Peaceful Crossings has branched out considerably in the last year. While originally the business focused mainly on transitions surrounding death, now it provides support for a wide variety of life transitions, and people at all stages of life can benefit. Peaceful Crossings is online at www.peacefulcrossings.com. They can be reached at 888-732-2346 and Callan Loo can be reached directly at Callan@peacefulcrossings.com. The office is located at 2723 S. State Street, Suite 150, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48104. New Practitioners and Businesses Vikki Narayan, a Registered Nurse and Certified Health Coach, has created My Wellness Nurse, a business serving those looking for personalized nutritional guidance. As a graduate of the Institute of Integrative Nutrition in New York, Narayan's teachers and mentors included nutrition and health leaders Dr. Andrew Weil, Dr. Deepak Chopra, and Dr. David Katz. Narayan explained that she works with people who want to have more energy, manage their weight, sleep better, and feel better overall. She coaches clients step by step to have better health habits and follows up to help them stay on track. She said, \"My approach to wellness is not to dwell on calories, carbohydrates, fats, and proteins. It's not to create lists of restrictions of good and bad foods. Instead, I work with my clients to create a happy, healthy life in a way that is flexible, fun, and rewarding.\" Narayan believes that everyone has different nutritional and health needs and that there is no one way that will work for everyone. This is why she works with her clients individually to help them develop the best habits for their own needs, goals, and preferences. One popular program is her 90-Day Jumpstart Your Health package, which includes unlimited email support and twice monthly meetings. Narayan explained that she can help clients learn to grocery shop for healthy foods, provide meal plans, and help identify individual goals and plans to reach them. Narayan meets with clients over the phone and in person, in their homes, or in public spaces such as coffee shops. Narayan offers a free consultation for those interested in learning how integrative health coaching can help them reach their health goals. Vikki Narayan can be reached at 734-678-6640 or mywellnessnurse@gmail.com. Her website is www.mywellnessnurse.com. In August of 2012, Sandy Bambi opened Grateful Dreads, a new salon in Kerrytown with a fashion forward, artistic, and holistic approach to hair styling and care. As her business name suggests, Bambi specializes in dreadlocking and interlocking hair, but she also specializes in custom extensions, curly hair, Asian hair, coloring, clipper cuts, and eyebrow threading. Bambi explained that she likes \"helping people love their hair.\" She said she helps people work with their hair, not against it, and to work through not liking their hair. Grateful Dreads carries several lines of products, all of which do not test on animals and many of which are vegan and organic. Original Moxy, made locally in Ypsilanti, is all natural, mostly organic, and vegan except for a few products that include silk. For dreads and locs she uses Naughty Boy, an organic and earth-friendly line. Bambi emphasizes the importance of nourishing hair. Sometimes, she said, clients come in asking for a 6-inch trim, when what they really need is a shorter trim and a deep conditioning treatment. About half of a haircut appointment with Bambi is spent on the cut; the other half is spent at the shampoo station with a shampoo and deep conditioning to nourish the hair and restore it to better health. Peaceful Crossings is offering a new series of workshops called the Intentional Living Series to help people as they go through the big transitions in life like divorce, marriage, childbirth, rites of passage, aging, grief, and even starting a business.

To honor this, she helps people express themselves through their hair. She loves trying new things and sometimes gets to watch her ideas \"take off like a tidal wave.\" She enjoys working with models and photographers to create unique looks. Her custom extensions are hand made and colored and designed specifically for the individual. Bambi also educates clients on caring for their hair. Parents will sometimes bring in their mixed-race children, not knowing how to care for or style their hair. Bambi educates them, helps the children feel comfortable, cares for their hair, and ensures that everyone leaves relaxed and happy. As a Reiki practitioner, Bambi can also use energy work to help clients relax, let go of any tension, and feel comfortable during the hair cutting or styling experience. Grateful Dreads provides a private experience and complete privacy is available on request, for example when a client needs to keep her hair covered for religious reasons. Bambi does offer a free consultation for those considering dreads/locs, extensions, coloring, and for those looking for solutions for their hair. Sandy Bambi can be reached at 734-769-0859 or sandybambihair@gmail.com. Grateful Dreads is online at www.gratefuldreadsannarbor.com and includes a photo blog with many examples of Bambi's work. In October of 2012, Reverend James Parker held the first service of Christ Unity Church, which meets at the Morris Lawrence Building on the Washtenaw Community College campus. Currently, there are about 40 active members of this growing and very diverse spiritual community. From the church's website, Unity is \"positive, practical Christianity.\" Reverend Parker explained that Unity truly believes in Christian principles, but has other influences, such as Buddhism's idea that \"what you think is what you become.\" The mission of the Christ Unity community is \"to make the world a better place... and uplift lives,\" he said. Unity teaches that heaven and hell are not just distant places that we go to after death, but that we create our own heaven and hell here on earth through our actions, thoughts, and deeds. Reverend Parker said that the Christ Unity community is for those who are open to being around positive thinking people, not looking to be bound by one set of rules or dogma, and who want to come together to serve, share, and pray. The congregation is \"uniquely diverse,\" said Parker, with members who are \"black, white, gay and straight,\" and everyone is respected and valued. He described the church as a \"spiritual family\" and community devoted to supporting one another in spiritual growth. Over the Christmas season, the community \"adopted\" several families in need and provided gifts for them. The group is planning future charitable service such as visiting and care-giving for the elderly and support for women's shelters. A Sunday morning service at Christ Unity begins with a greeting and 5-minute meditation, followed by music ministry, which Reverend Parker said is \"very good and active,\" with some even performing original songs. After Reverend Parker's message, the congregation shares refreshments and fellowship. All are welcome to attend. Christ Unity Church meets at 10:30 a.m. on Sundays at the Morris Lawrence Building, Washtenaw Community College, 4800 E. Huron River Drive #150, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48105. The mailing address is 2080 Whittaker Road #177, Ypsilanti, Michigan 48197 and the phone number is 734-864-2533. The church is online at www.christunitya2.org. Bloom Garden Center just opened in what used to be the Dexter Gardens facility. Bloom Garden Center represents a collaboration of businesses related to gardening, landscaping, water gardening, locally grown produce, and art. Founder Traven Pelletier, owner of the landscaping company Elemental Design, which has served Ann Arbor since 2000, explained that the location has interested him for years as he passed it driving from his home in Dexter. Describing the building as a \"unique old barn,\" he envisions it as an \"artsy boutique-style garden center.\" In addition to being a landscaper, Pelletier is an artist and sculptor and has been combining the two with outdoor installations. After speaking to various contacts about the facility, several were interested in collaborating with him on the endeavor, and he said, from there, the plan \"sort of magically came together.\" White Lotus Farms, an Ann Arbor organic farm producing vegetables, eggs, artisanal breads, and goat's milk products, will have a farm cart on site, and helped with the building's purchase. Pelletier's Elemental Design landscape company will be housed here. The Garden Shop will carry unique garden ornaments, decorations, and sculptures, including one-of-a-kind pieces by local artists, as well as other art and even vintage jewelry. Local water gardening company Poseidon Ponds will sell water gardening elements and related services. Bloom will also house The Garden Center, which will offer organic annuals and perennials, garden starters, trees and shrubs, as well as organic gardening supplies. Atsal Khandro will manage The Garden Center, drawing on 20 years of experience working in a large contemplative garden. Bloom will also provide workshops on topics related to gardening, landscaping, and landscape design. Pelletier said some old items from Dexter Gardens will be for sale alongside Bloom's new items. The first workshops were held in April, covering landscape design and fruit trees, respectively. The Garden Center's grand opening will be on May 4 and 5. A coupon for 10 percent off your first Garden Shop purchase is available on the company's website. Bloom Garden Center is located at 1885 Baker Road, Dexter, Michigan 48130.

Karen Linder and John Marchello founded U&Me Time in 2011 to help couples dealing with sexual dysfunction due to health problems return to a healthy sex life. After her husband experienced a debilitating car crash, Linder realized that many couples need a safe harbor when dealing with Erectile Dysfunction (ED). As a prostate cancer survivor, Marchello used his background as a designer and inventor to develop a penavascular exerciser to compliment other treatments for ED. Erectile Dysfunction can be caused by a variety of health problems, including cancer, diabetes, kidney disease, vascular disease, surgery, and injury.

Local energy healer Tammy Braswell began her journey in energetic healing in 2007, becoming attuned as a Reiki practitioner. Describing herself as a lifelong \"sensitive,\" Braswell said that after learning and practicing Reiki, she felt guided to further explore how she could assist more people in raising their consciousness, awareness, and vibration to achieve greater levels of health, happiness, fulfillment, and abundance in their lives. In the last five years, she learned the first level of Pranic Healing and Quantum Touch, including the Quantum Touch Core Transformation; she became a certified Spiritual Life Coach; and had Health and Wellness Coach training. She began offering her services to others outside family and friends in the last two years. Braswell's energy healing sessions include coaching, cleansing and balancing of the chakras, running energy to specific areas as guided and desired by the client, re-energizing of all the energy systems and chakras, and offering Angel Card and intuitive readings. Recently, Braswell channeled a new activation, which she has been guided to share with as many people as possible, called Awakening the Core Essence. Braswell will offer this activation via teleconference approximately twice per month so that people all over the world can experience it. She described the Core Essence as \"a sphere of divine energy that accelerates the soul's growth,\" which in most of us lies dormant until we begin to consciously awaken to our divine nature. Dates for Braswell's Awakening the Core Essence teleconferences will be listed on her website as they are scheduled, at www.createbyvibration.com. Braswell can be reached at 734-716-2881 or at CreateByVibration@gmail.com.

Buchtel originally moved to Guangzhou after receiving a music degree to play the French horn in the Guangzhou Orchestra. After becoming fluent in Chinese, he decided to pursue another of his interests, Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), and completed a five-year post-graduate degree at the Hunan University of TCM (HUTCM). While he was a student, he worked as a freelance medical interpreter and translator, and some of the Traditional Chinese Medicine books and articles he translated have been published in China and England.

The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2013 Page 21 The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2013 Page 22 By Mary Runser Photography by Susan Ayer This is one of a series of articles we have been doing on local business owners and their businesses. As the economy in Michigan has begun to slowly improve, there are still brave souls who have taken the leap of faith to open their own businesses here, and others who have revitalized their older businesses. What follows are profiles of two interesting businesses that are thriving despite the odds. Unique arts and crafts work, and much more. A place where ideas come together:METAL \u2014 a design and fabrication studio and gallery METAL, LLC. Claudette Jocelyn Stern and John Daniel Walters, owners METAL Ann Arbor, 220 Felch St., Ann Arbor, Michigan, 48103; (800) 613-6385; e-mail: info@metaloffmain.com; website: www.metaloffmain.com A blend of dictionary definitions seen on a tee shirt from the local business METAL reflects both the origins and nature of this metal design and fabrication shop and gallery: METAL, noun: a mixture containing two or more metallic elements or metallic and nonmetallic elements usually fused together or dissolving into each other when molten METTLE, noun: courage and fortitude, the courage to carry on It was John Walters and Claudette Stern's intention, when they opened METAL, to produce a wide range of metal goods. The shop offers one-of-a-kind fine-art objects created on a commission basis as well as a line of custom-made furnishings and architectural fixtures that are both functional and aesthetically pleasing. With a gallery that includes fine-art, vintage, and repurposed items (the latter addressing the pair's environmental concerns), John and Claudette also collect, design, and produce many beautiful and durable forms themselves from metal that Claudette said she hopes \"will... become something like the old mahogany table your grandmother had and will end up with one of your relatives.\" On any given day, items sold at the shop or through its website might range from an antique measuring cup to a fine-art fireplace screen.Claudette had an early introduction to metalworking \u2014 her father owned a Michigan-based precision ball and bearing business, with branches in California and New York, from the 1940s through the 1980s. Prior to cofounding METAL, Claudette's love of metal work led her to Tucumcari, New Mexico, and the Mesalands Community College annual iron pour, where groups of people with a passion for saving and repurposing iron come together to turn disposed hunks of metal into pieces of cast-iron art. Claudette explained that she is \"essentially a self-taught creature. I was ready to drop out of high school at the age of 16 because I knew I wanted to write and to be involved in the world of art,\" she said, recalling that her parents would have liked her to have taken at least a few college courses. She started a small press called Lemon in her early twenties while she was living in the San Francisco Bay Area. She'd always been fascinated with the process of book making (small-press work), so she learned bookbinding while living there. \"I'd planned on publishing my own poetry as well as making a press where those from my generation could publish their art and work,\" she said. Claudette defines herself as a \"producer.\" She makes her own art, writes, and has even been a filmmaker. The last film she produced, Bilal's Stand (2010), was accepted by the Sundance Film Festival and was shown in the Museum of Modern Art's New Producer/New Films Festival. Claudette explained that, when she was younger, it seemed to her as though all these things in her life were completely different and totally unrelated. \"Three decades later, I realize they are all the same thing,\" she said. \"At the heart, it's really all about relationship, communication, and cooperation.\" It was at the iron pour that Claudette and John met. \"John grew up working on cars, and the first time we met, it was because I was fascinated by this really tricked out truck he had,\" Claudette said. She and John next worked together on The Nautilus House \u2014 Claudette's LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) platinum certified home remodel. LEED is an internationally recognized green building certification system. Claudette and John named her home The Nautilus House in reference to the \"golden mean, or that which is most harmonious to the eye, with a secondary allusion to the collaboration of the owner/designer/builder and their figurative spiraling in and out during the creative process,\" Claudette said. When Claudette revealed her idea for METAL, John was on board right away. They decided that METAL was to include many things. \"We could restore cars, make sculpture, do public art, and have a gallery which included fine art,\" Claudette Jocelyn Stern, Andrew Kyte, Sarah Carroll, John Daniel Walters The shop offers one-of-a-kind fine-art objects created on a commission basis as well as a line of custom-made furnishings and architectural fixtures that are both functional and aesthetically pleasing.\"I work much more intuitively, where John is more pragmatic and linear \u2014 very detail oriented, \" Claudette said. \"It actually makes for a very sound and balanced business relationship. \" \u2014Claudette SternLeaps of Faith: Tales of Local BusinessesThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2013 Page 23 Claudette explained. \"It was thrilling for me to find someone who didn't just want to bat around ideas, but really cared to produce from shared interests such as environmental concerns, art, metal, automobiles \u2014 the idea that we could make really beautiful, aesthetically pleasing objects that will be long lived and, in some cases, have a history to them.\" Claudette and John rented the space on Ann Arbor's Felch Street in September 2010 and opened their doors for business in April 2011. Claudette was excited by how two such different people with completely different abilities would be working together. \"I work much more intuitively, where John is more pragmatic and linear \u2014 very detail oriented,\" Claudette said. \"It actually makes for a very sound and balanced business relationship.\" In August of 2012, Claudette and John brought Drew Kyte and Sarah Carroll into the METAL family. Drew, who had a previous relationship with Claudette and John, had been a full-time blacksmith for ten years. He'd learned his trade by studying under journeymen in both the United States and Europe and perfected his skills working for master craftsman Atelier Zimmerman, in Germany. Drew now works for METAL as a designer and blacksmith. Claudette describes Sarah Carroll as a woman \"whose background included everything from mathematics and cost analysis to children's gyms and career counseling.\" Her diverse background and love for art drew her to METAL, and she has carved out a full-time position there performing accounting, social networking, and other business tasks. With Drew and Sarah on board, John and Claudette began focusing on creating a line of art pieces and furnishings at prices more affordable to the general public than some of the commission pieces they'd had for sale, such as a one-of-a-kind conference table with a price tag of $15,000. Claudette and John also felt that they wanted to extend METAL's reach beyond Southeast Michigan, both in terms of production and sales. With the creation of an online shopping site, they have now given METAL a global reach. \"We want our work to be accessible worldwide,\" Claudette said. \"If we're to become a design team of note, which I hope we will be someday, we want people from around the globe to discover us \u2014 and in turn, we want to be able to draw from other cultures and incorporate specific cultural influences into our designs for a given client in a given country. It's all about having a global outlook starting from a local perspective.\" She said that she and John realized that fabrication of their products could also be done elsewhere, while maintaining the same quality design and production as pieces fabricated at METAL. However, in some cases, she said, all design and production may be done by METAL, with shipping and onsite installation done by another party. The main idea, she said, is finding the best way to serve their clients on each project. Claudette said she had always believed there was a niche for a gallery like METAL \u2014 a gallery \"other than the stark, white-walled sort. I wanted our gallery to be similar to the way I keep my home, which is to mix things together \u2014 where at times you'd have difficulty picking out the art from the found objects.\" And that is exactly what Claudette and John have created. With METAL's open layout, customers and the curious can actually see how something is created while they're visiting. \"It might be loud and dusty when production is taking place,\" Claudette said, \"but I think people find it interesting.\"Beyond producing and selling furnishings and artwork made from metal, METAL is also becoming known as an entertainment venue in Ann Arbor. In addition to hosting concerts and poetry readings, METAL has also offered arts and crafts demonstrations on blacksmithing; custom object design and fabrication; operation of the METAL-built gas forge that is used to create the accent pieces for a new line of tables; and tintype making, in which students learned how to shoot, process, and cure photographs on tin plates, the way it was done in the early years of photography. In addition to hosting arts events, METAL rents out its space for weddings, rehearsal dinners, private parties, and other festivities, as well as for public events cohosted with pot & box, a business located right next door. \"Again, the idea was to not only create a space where beautiful pieces of art are made, but to become a hub of cultural exchange,\" Claudette said, adding that pot & box owner Lisa Waud and her staff help her and John attain that goal. \"We share an energy that's upbeat and helps generate lots of ideas for cooperative kinds of work,\" Claudette commented. METAL's connection to the community brings rewards on many levels, Claudette said. \"We definitely have a holistic approach to business because we live in a culture that frequently values and extols commerce over community and cooperation,\" she said. Making ourselves available for relationship with various groups and encouraging more than the making of money and the selling of goods is exciting because we open ourselves to a multitude of opportunities.... The people I've met since John and I started METAL, and the ideas that have been fostered, are invigorating.\" \"I wanted our gallery to be similar to the way I keep my home, which is to mix things together \u2014 where at times you' d have difficulty picking out the art from the found objects. \" \u2014Claudette Stern \"It was thrilling for me to find someone who didn't just want to bat around ideas, but really cared to produce from shared interests... the idea that we could make really beautiful, aesthetically pleasing objects that will be long lived and, in some cases, have a history to them. \" \"[W]e want to be able to draw from other cultures and incorporate specific cultural influences into our designs for a given client in a given country. It's all about having a global outlook starting from a local perspective. \" \u2014Claudette Stern\"John grew up working on cars, and the first time we met, it was because I was fascinated by this really tricked out truck he had. \" Continued on page 24 The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2013 Page 24 pot & box Lisa Waud, owner pot & box, 220 Felch St., Ann Arbor, Michigan, 48103; (734) 368-2130; email: lisa@potandbox.com; website: potandbox.com Even in a difficult economy, Lisa Waud can report that her business, pot & box, is doing well. The floral shop celebrated its third anniversary on Valentine's Day, she said, adding that the business is actually celebrating six years in business, because Lisa worked out of her home before moving her business to Ann Arbor's Felch Street in 2010. Pot & box started as a half-gardening and half-floral design business until it suddenly took off as a floral shop. \"Now we're a full-on flower shop that does floral design for weddings and community events,\" Lisa explained. \"We do events for the University of Michigan and for Eastern Michigan University. We still plant in pots and boxes... but we try to be a little more creative for weddings and events.\" Reflecting on how she and her staff specialize in natural-looking centerpieces and accent pieces, she described using birch trees for an event at the University of Michigan's Crisler Center after being asked to create a forest effect. \"Of course we can do that!\" Lisa recalled responding to the clients. \"And we did!\" Lisa readily admits to her tendency to say \"yes\" to some idea, then having to figure out exactly how to do it. But she said that's part of the creative process. Originally from Petoskey, Michigan, Lisa took a circuitous, albeit interesting, route from her hometown to Ann Arbor and to pot & box. \"When I graduated from high school, I wanted to work outside because it was beautiful up north, and everyone wanted to be outside.\" she said. She described how she'd very much wanted to work at a business called Polly's Planting and Plucking and that, although the business was fully staffed, the owner created a position for her because of her persistence in applying to work there. Lisa worked at Polly's Planting and Plucking for six seasons. \"I'd leave to go to school or travel and then come back and work for the summer. It was just so lovely working outside every day, and working with plants.\" After six seasons at Polly's Planting and Plucking, Lisa and her friend Amanda Ehrnst started their own gardening business in Petoskey called Bella Fiore and ran it together for three seasons. Lisa decided after that third season that she wasn't going to return to her hometown after finishing college. She then attended classes in horticulture and landscape design at Michigan State University for three years and later attended Evergreen State College in Olympia, Washington. Her initial intention was to go into environmental studies and, with her love of nature, to help change environmental laws to expand protection of the natural environment. Her first class at Evergreen was in nature writing, and she loved it. \"So, I actually graduated with a degree in writing,\" she said. Lisa said living in the Pacific Northwest gave her more opportunities to garden. \"It got a little muddy in February, but I could garden year-round,\" she said. Wanting to experience more year-round gardening as well as warmer temperatures and more USDA growing zones, she moved to Hawaii for a year. \"It was wonderful, really, but I'm a Michigander, and it was time to go back home,\" she said. Rather than returning to Petoskey, however, Lisa made Ann Arbor her home. She'd visited frequently in the past and loved the area. She took a job waiting tables at the Ann Arbor restaurant Jerusalem Garden, and eventually planted their box gardens. That's when it became clear to Lisa that she really wanted to get back into gardening. \"Many people think that I must come from a long line of gardeners, but that's just not true.\" Lisa said, explaining that all the natural beauty up north had made her long to be outside as much as possible, and gardening allowed her to do that. \"The first day I worked at Polly's Planting and Plucking in Petoskey, I was told to go out and pluck the geraniums,\" Lisa said. \"I had no idea what geraniums were.\" But she learned, and that was the beginning of Lisa's successful gardening career. She named her business \"pot & box\" primarily because that's how she likes to garden \u2014 in containers. \"They're like tiny little gardens,\" she said, noting that when she started the business she did much of the planting and gardening herself but also paid friends to help out. Eventually word got around that she \"knew\" flowers, and people began to ask if she'd do flowers for weddings. She recalled saying to these requests, \"You know, that's really totally different, but sure, I can do that, and we'll just call it your wedding present. I loved doing it!\" \"I started pot & box when I probably shouldn't have,\" Lisa said, in reference to the Michigan economy. \"But my business has done well, and I have the community of Ann Arbor to thank for that.\" Lisa admitted that there have been both joys and frustrations in owning her own business; she said she learns something new every day. \"Just when I think I've got a good system going, something changes, and I have to revamp and try again. I've always believed that if you're doing something that moves people, even in a bad economy, it works. If we create the kind of experience people want, then they'll make room for us in their lives.\" Lisa said that one of the most heartwarming parts about owning the business is interacting with the community. \"I hate networking when you're wearing a nametag and the situation or environment is forced and awkward,\" she said. \"I love to find a more organic connection with people.\" With that goal in mind, Lisa helped bring together a collective of business owners and some of their clients to do a bridal expo in a way that she said was fun and much less stressful than putting on such a show at a local mall. This is the third year for the event, called \"The Wedding Party.\" In addition to pot & box, it includes such local businesses as The Gown Shop, Sweet Heather Anne, Viva La Diva, DJ Graffiti, Abby Rose Photography, Elevated Press, and the catering business known simply as \"eat.\" \"It's a great way to introduce our clients to other vendors they're in need of to create their wedding,\" Lisa said.Leaps of Faith: Tales of Local Businesses Continued from page 23 \"Now we're a full-on flower shop that does floral design for weddings and community events.... We still plant in pots and boxes... but we try to be a little more creative for weddings and events. \" \u2014Lisa Waud\"When I graduated from high school, I wanted to work outside because it was beautiful up north, and everyone wanted to be outside. \"The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2013 Page 25 The Bloom Florist Collective is another organic connection and collection of Ann Arbor florists that Lisa helped create. \"I'd kept my eye on these other three florists in town, basically because we were all doing similar work \u2014 something a little bit different than the ordinary florist,\" Lisa explained. \"I invited them over for coffee and talk, and while we were all a little uncomfortable about being ourselves and giving away trade secrets at first, suddenly everyone just opened up and started talking. It's turned into this really great resource. The Bloom Florist Collective includes Holly from Sweet Pea Floral Design, Tracy from Red Poppy Floral Design, Sue from Passionflower, and Lisa from pot & box.\" The group is a little more formally organized now and offers design classes to the general public. And oftentimes, when the businesses are booked tightly with orders for wedding bouquets, they help each other out by literally working side by side. \"I don't want to sound mushy, but it's very heartwarming, because it's really become all about sharing. It raises the bar so we all do better work,\" Lisa said. Lisa has spent more time in Detroit over the last few years. She has become completely smitten with the city and has come to the realization that she wants to move and work there. \"But I love Ann Arbor. It gave me my business,\" she said. \"Rather than move pot & box to Detroit, I'm going to open up a second shop there.\" She's already picked out a building for the shop \u2014 an old gas station, which will be similar to the space in Ann Arbor and will challenge people's thinking about space, especially for floral shops. \"We'll be taking an old, greasy gas station and turning it into something unexpected, with little flower gardens outside and lots of color and flower coolers inside.\" A good deal of work needs to be done to the building and grounds to make the new space suitable, but Lisa hopes that by the end of 2013, pot & box Detroit will be open and fully functional for the holiday season. As part of a plan for advertising the new shop, Lisa has purchased an old ice cream truck that she will use as a mobile flower shop. \"Between pushing petals out of the repurposed truck and the Valentine's Day pop-up market we hosted at the future space, we hope that Detroiters are as excited as we are for pot & box to set up shop in the city.\" ### \"I started pot & box when I probably shouldn't have.

The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2013 Page 26 The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2013 Page 27 Spencer Michaud, The Musical Seeker A gifted songwriter, music educator, writer, and philosopher, he wants to live an \"exceptional life\" by encompassing all these aspects of himself into a cohesive whole. Continued on page 28By David Wak Photos by Tobi HollanderThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2013 Page 28 Spencer Michaud, The Musical Seeker It's Friday night in the upstairs tearoom at Crazy Wisdom Bookstore in downtown Ann Arbor. Every weekend local musicians play to a full and sometimes packed house. It's a cozy space with comfy couches and stuffed chairs, with a good view of the city through tall windows behind the stage. I'm sitting among a large crowd that's being mesmerized by up and coming singer/songwriter Spencer Michaud. Michaud is a thin guy in his 30s with dark blond hair, an easygoing smile, and a manner that's disarming. He looks younger than his age, yet carries an aura of someone with wisdom beyond his years. His songs combine elements of folk, rock, and even funk, and he possesses a powerful and expressive voice that ranges from a smooth tenor to a penetrating falsetto, using both to great effect. When asked to describe his sound, he said it's a cross between The Beatles, Queen, and Motown. I'd add Jeff Buckley to the list, one of Michaud's musical heroes. Like any good songwriter, he writes the kind of songs that ask one to listen closely. His lyrics are more than clever rhymes; they unfold intricate stories. He plays a Queen-inspired song called \"Leda Feeds the Swan,\" a rather lengthy and ambitious homage to a famous Greek myth about Zeus seducing Leda while in swan form and fathering the central figures of the Trojan War. The song has many changes in tempo and mood, starting out slowly, evoking an idyllic setting and a fragile peace. It then becomes foreboding as the lyrics chronicle the Trojan War's themes of tragedy, death, and reconciliation. The gentle tones he began with reemerge at the end slightly heavier, changed by the tragic aftermath of war. The impressive way in which Michaud weaves moods and narratives into \"Leda Feeds the Swan\" can be found throughout his growing and varied songbook. His music is sometimes whimsical, with songs about childhood toys and French daredevils. Other times it's more serious, exploring themes like love, war, and the complexity of living. This yin and yang coexist in his work with ease. After having listened to his music, seen him perform, and spoken to him, it seems the term Renaissance man, which is sometimes overused, certainly applies. A gifted songwriter, music educator, writer, and philosopher, he wants to live an \"exceptional life\" by encompassing all these aspects of himself into a cohesive whole. Growing up there was music all around him. His father played flute and guitar, while his mom and maternal grandmother were both great singers. His love of singing came from listening to his family sing together when he was a kid. His youthful musical tastes were very eclectic, including everything from The Beatles to Elton John to Metallica. He especially loved Michael Jackson, whom he admired for a percussive singing style that seemed to mirror his dancing. He explained, \"My influences are wide,\" and he's been trying to absorb all of them and make them part of his music. As a kid he used to goof around on his dad's acoustic guitar but didn't get serious about playing until he was 14. At first he was self-taught, practicing four to six hours a day, but when he was 17, he took guitar lessons and really began to hone his craft. After high school he went Western Michigan University to study music and creative writing. While he was there he taught guitar at Marshall Music to as many as 30 students per class, which planted the seed for his role as a music educator down the road. He also began to write and play his own music. It was around then that he and some fellow Marshall employees founded a promising band, but it soon broke up, much to his disappointment. After that, he was disillusioned with bands altogether and worked only as a solo act for many years. It was also around then that he discovered Jeff Buckley. Buckley's songs and emotional intensity spoke to him as he listened to his landmark recording Grace endlessly. He felt a kindred spirit in Buckley \u2014 both of their parents split up when they were young, and through him, Michaud heard much of his own youthful pain and disorientation. \"It was like he was singing everything I was feeling,\" he said. His admiration for Buckley bordered on obsession. Buckley's high-pitched, ethereal vocals and song structures inspired many of his own compositions, and he even made a pilgrimage to the Wolf River near Memphis where Buckley drowned in 1997, ending his promising career too soon. Michaud eventually became a regular performer at the Uncommon Ground Festival in Chicago where Buckley's work and life are celebrated. While playing there, he met and became friendly with Buckley's mother. Although Buckley's influence remains strong for Michaud, he feels he's now found his own voice and has a unique sound that combines many influences. After graduating from college in 2004, Michaud moved to Ann Arbor/Ypsilanti to be near his young daughter and soon made his way into the local music scene. He performed at the open mike night at T.C.'s Speakeasy in Ypsilanti and eventually hosted it. He said he really \"cut his teeth as a performer at T.C.'s,\" which has since been closed. Around that time he took songwriting and music business courses at Washtenaw Community College. Local jazz guitarist Johnny Lawrence instructed his music business course and encouraged him to find other ways to make money in music besides performing. Eventually Michaud applied to Washtenaw to teach songwriting classes and landed the job. He found teaching was a natural extension of his performing self and added that he often learned as much from his students as he taught them. \"Classes are as much about life as learning skills,\" he said. When he started writing songs, he wrote mostly from personal experience, but over time he learned to be a keen observer of the world and a musical storyteller. One of his more lighthearted songs is called \"Tightrope Walker,\" a whimsical tune about French daredevil Philippe Petit who walked between the Twin Towers in 1974. The song is a driving and syncopated ode to the man's audacity and starts out with a slow, reflective intro verse: \"It's a bird, it's a plane, hey man, this guy must be insane.\" Then the song breaks into mid tempo acoustic funk. \"He's a tightrope walker staring at the seagulls in the sky.\" It ends with a whimsical last line, summing up what possibly drives the man: \"Because there's nowhere else he would rather be, than walking off into eternity.\" Michaud explores his more serious side with the song \"The Chaos We've Become,\" inspired by the time he lived in an Ann Arbor co-op, an environment he said was a good way to delay adulthood, even as it lurks relentlessly in the background. The lyrics are full of rich imagery set to a driving 6/8 ballad on acoustic guitar. There's a restless feel in the air tonight, and the ashtrays are filling with memories, and the bottles are piling up on the lawn. There's a halo around the full moon tonight, and the thread of our sanity is broken, in the light of this surrogate sun, we'll never leave the cares we've become... Toward the end of the song, Michaud perhaps puts to rest the tragedy of Jeff Buckley's death and its effect on him: \"I made peace with the music he never made.\" When asked to describe his sound, he said it's a cross between The Beatles, Queen, and Motown. I'd add Jeff Buckley to the list, one of Michaud's musical heroes.Buckley's songs and emotional intensity spoke to him as he listened to his landmark recording Grace endlessly. For Michaud, a good performance is like \"a light switch turns on\" inside him and his creative spirit is energized.One thing that helps ground Michaud is being a good parent to his daughter. He said children are defenseless in this world, so one has to be vigilant and caring for something beyond themself. For him, this means being a good role model and trying to pass on sound values. Part of his example is living a sober lifestyle, preferring natural ways of getting high, such as meditation, which he practices regularly. Over the years he has studied many religious traditions and their symbols and is fascinated by how they can be used to connect people, much like music can. He wears crystals and talks a lot about people's vibes and energies. His spiritual and philosophical ideas are not merely ones he thinks about in the abstract, but ones he embraces in his everyday interactions with the world. He once told me, \"Wisdom is when you take a vision into reality.\" With more performances and a new EP coming soon, Michaud's vision is unfolding nicely and is supported by a growing fan base. He's well on his way to an exceptional life. ###The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2013 Page 29 For years he preferred playing alone, but, in March 2011, he did an about face and formed a three-piece band with bass guitar and drums. He said he wanted a backup band to both expand the sound of his songs and increase the possibilities of getting gigs. Since forming the band, they've played around at local venues like Woodruffs in Ypsilanti and Hollerfest in Brooklyn, Michigan. Michaud said they average about a gig a month, but, like most musicians, wish there were more. For Michaud, a good performance is like \"a light switch turns on\" inside him and his creative spirit is energized. Having a shared experience with the audience is therapeutic for him. And as a live performer Michaud certainly delivers. Whether it's a solo acoustic performance or an electric show with his band, he plays each show with energy and verve. He uses two microphones, one for regular vocals, mixed with a healthy dose of reverb, and an extra mike with echo effects to create ethereal vocals, which add great dimension to his songs. Besides playing his own songs, Michaud occasionally throws in covers. At an October solo gig at Crazy Wisdom Bookstore he did Michael Jackson's hit \"Human Nature,\" a mellow and reflective song from Thriller . Michaud did a commendable balancing act of paying homage to the original tune and making it his own \u2014 a hard trick to pull off for any performer. While Michaud has been performing to accolades for years, he has never had a recording for his fans to own, but that is about to change. He and his band have been working on a four-song EP with local producer Jim Roll, a noted songwriter himself. Michaud said he values Roll's input, calling him a \"wizard of engineering,\" and adds he's helped him cut through extraneous musical ideas to get the project going. The project's working title is The Hero with 1,000 Faces. In addition to his band, he has also enlisted Erin Zindle from The Ragbirds on violin and Zach Nichols from Frontier Ruckus on trumpet and the musical saw for the project. This is not Michaud's first try at making a record. In 2008 he began to record a rock opera about a man who believes he's found his soulmate, but he gave up on it when it was only half finished. He said that experience taught him not to overextend himself. This time around he feels more confident in his process, adding that he plans to finish the opera someday. Michaud admits that when he was younger he struggled to find a balance between internal and external pressures, sometimes losing himself in his music while neglecting his relationships. Nowadays he takes a healthy approach to creativity, nurturing it while trying not to own it too much. He looks at creativity in two ways; first, as a midwife who channels it and brings it into the world healthy; second, as a sculptor, learning techniques to be a good craftsman for one's creativity. \"You're a master when you can do both well,\" he said. He found teaching was a natural extension of his performing self and added that he often learned as much from his students as he taught them. Michaud explores his more serious side with the song \"The Chaos We've Become,\" inspired by the time he lived in an Ann Arbor co-op, an environment he said was a good way to delay adulthood, even as it lurks relentlessly in the background.

Incredibly shy, I sat back in my chair. But my soul, swayed by the rhythm and swirl of black leotards and pink slippers, peeked forward, utterly captivated \u2014 perhaps hoping that, one day, I too would move like the other little girls. I must have talked about this experience for a long time because, that year on Christmas morning, there was a box with my own leotard, slippers, and tutu. Instead of smiling, I started to cry. Fear washed over me and my soul receded behind my shyness. I begged my mother to return the items to Santa Claus at the North Pole. Much to her dismay, she did. But I could never forget dancing, simply because rhythm lived with me constantly. The television was rarely on, but the stereo always seemed to be. My mother cleaned the house to a beat. Her younger siblings, between my age and hers, introduced me to their music and dance moves. My grandfather, a lover of jazz, entertained our family with his own signature dance that we called \"The Mouse.\" My family danced and I danced along with them, feeling not only the music, but joy. My confidence grew and when I was 16, I felt emboldened to sign up for a dance class. That turned out to be a mistake. My teacher was younger than I and, rather than teach, she humiliated the students by laughing at them and gossiping loudly with her friends. Angry, I quit the class. But I kept dancing. To commercials. To the hum of the dishwasher. Even to the wind blowing through the pine and oak \"grandmothers\" encircling my house. And, several years ago, my workouts changed from the monotony of the treadmill to the ecstasy of dancing. In the privacy of my basement, using videos and connecting to the earth with bare feet, I came to intimately understand the delicious freedom of being able to move my body. I raised my arms in celebration while doing bhangra , a Punjabi folk dance. I laughed and sweated through the choreographed dances of Bollywood. Through belly dancing, my hips opened me to the infinity of my strength, sensuality, and sacredness that is my feminine being. For at least one hour a day, I surrendered completely to the dance. I knew joy. Joy is addictive. I wanted more. And with the wisdom that comes from knowing who I am \u2014 as well as being in my forties and no longer caring what other people think \u2014 I decided to try another dance class. I chose English Country Dancing. This formal style of partnered dance began as a way for courtly ladies and gentlemen during the reign of Elizabeth I to socialize and continued in popularity into the early ninteenth century, during the lifetime of Jane Austen. I must admit that I am more a fan of British murder mysteries than of Austen, so choosing to learn this particular style seemed incongruous to me. But it was because of the passion of my guide and aptly named Joy Coach, Bronwen Gates, that this style of dance that grabbed me. When Gates described a move called gypsy, in which the partners circle each other by holding only their gaze, I found the idea of that flirtatious tension beautiful and somehow earthy, despite the formality. I could also relate: when I belly dance in the basement, my eyes are very much a part of it. I was sold. Sponsored by the Ann Arbor Community of Traditional Music and Dance (AACTMAD) and held Tuesday nights from 7:00 to 9:30 at the Chapel Hill Condominium Clubhouse, English Country Dancing (and its live musical accompaniment, performed by professionals) costs only seven dollars. A few hours before the class began, however, I met with Gates in her home to learn some basic moves. In the class, each dance begins with a short lesson and then a c aller would literally call out the moves in time for us to perform them to the music. There was a whole new vocabulary to learn. Gates taught me how to gate, in which the partners take each other by the same hand and create a balanced tension between them (as if they were a gatepost) and they pivot while glancing into each other's eyes. I learned to cast off by using one shoulder to turn away from and around my partner. Gates talked about how the dances progress. In a set of four, partners face each other and the couple closest to the band is designated the \"first couple,\" while their neighbors are the \"second couple.\" In a long line of dancers, there are many first and second couples as the choreography progresses down the line. When a first couple makes it to the end, they stand out one turn of the dance, but then rejoin the progression as either a first couple or a second couple and move back up the line toward the band. Gates assured me that, in person, it would make more sense. It didn't. Not for quite a while, anyway. Then again, when I arrived to the clubhouse, my nerves were ticklish. I smiled bigger than I normally do and laughed a bit harder than I meant to. I thought I would be able to mingle more, settle in, and shyly watch a few dances from a chair, getting a feel for both the music and the movement. I kept dancing. To commercials. To the hum of the dishwasher. Even to the wind blowing through the pine and oak \"grandmothers\" encircling my house. And, several years ago, my workouts changed from the monotony of the treadmill to the ecstasy of dancing.Another Chance to Dance ...When I arrived to the clubhouse, my nerves were ticklish. I smiled bigger than I normally do and laughed a bit harder than I meant to. I thought I would be able to mingle more, settle in, and shyly watch a few dances from a chair, getting a feel for both the music and the movement. I was wrong. When Bronwen Gates described a move called gypsy, in which the partners circle each other by holding only their gaze, I found the idea of that flirtatious tension beautiful and somehow earthy, despite the formality. I could also relate: when I belly dance in the basement, my eyes are very much a part of it. I was sold. The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2013 Page 31 I was wrong. After meeting the callers and a few of Gates's friends, a man older than my father asked me if I had a partner. I shook my head and found myself blushing, which caused me to blush even more. Despite knowing that only our hands or arms would briefly touch in the dance to come, being asked to partner by someone other than my husband was an unexpected and almost unbearable intimacy. My reaction freaked me out. And so, too, did the gypsy: even though I changed partners with each dance, dancing with women as well as men, there were several dancers whose stares weren't flirtatious and joyful, but seemed to challenge with a dark and heavy energy. A visceral, protective need averted my gaze. Then, my third partner opened up an old wound: a feisty elderly woman seemed to be the incarnation of my teenaged dance teacher. \"Hey, Long Arms,\" she said, \"Step back!\" Surprised and a little offended, I almost stopped moving. \"Did she just call me 'Long Arms'?\" I thought. \"Man, people can be mean! Here I am a beginner, trying to find joy in something new, and she's making fun of my arms? Who does she think she is?\" \"Hey, Long Arms,\" she said, \"Step back!\" Surprised and a little offended, I almost stopped moving. \"Did she just call me 'Long Arms'?\" I thought. \"Man, people can be mean! Here I am a beginner, trying to find joy in something new, and she's making fun of my arms? Who does she think she is?\" I felt my smile slip from my face as I looked her in the eye. But then, I realized: I was standing in my own way. All of my discomfort belonged to me and me alone. I forgave her \u2014 and myself \u2014 instantly. After all, I was no longer the young girl easily embarrassed, and she certainly was not my immature dance instructor. She was just trying to help. She then said with a nod, \"You have those long arms. Step back a bit.\" So, I did. She smiled her approval. And finally, I began to relax. I learned a lot from her, as well as many of the other dancers. They'd point to where I needed to go or turn me around in the right direction. I danced the simple dances. I struggled and swore mildly through the more complicated ones, sacrificing all sense of rhythm for technicality. I even managed a gypsy or two without looking away. I sat out only one dance. And by the end of the class \u2014 exhausted, humbled, and smiling true \u2014 I understood the passion for this English Country Dancing. I long f or more...but, because I live near Grand Rapids, I am prevented only by distance from attending the class more often. However, I've kept what I learned with me. As soon as I returned home, even though it was after midnight, I showed all of my new moves to my husband. We fell out laughing at my long-armed, baby deer awkwardness. Laughing at myself \u2014 not out of embarrassment, but joy \u2014 felt pure and cathartic. But ther e has been a much more important result from learning English Country Dancing: I'm achieving an inner strength, simply because I've learned how to use my eyes. When I dance in the basement now, I play with my eyes more than I ever did, flirting and captivating an imaginary audience. And, in my daily life, I no longer avert my gaze for any reason. I gypsy everyone! I'm grateful that I didn't sit out this experience. Parts of me \u2014 the old, useless habits that have no place in my life today \u2014 wanted to. But the greater parts couldn't. I allowed myself to look silly, to feel incredibly vulnerable, to make mistakes, and to take missteps. More importantly, I allowed every fear of mine to wash over me \u2014 not to suck me down into myself, as in the past, but to leave me cleansed with the pure joy of moving my body and soul in new and challenging ways.

The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2013 Page 32 Lives of Co-operation: A Look at Some of the People Who Are Making our Local Co-operatives Happen \"Co-operatives are a reminder to the international community that it is possible to pursue both economic viability and social responsibility.\" -Ban Ki-moon, U.N. Secretary General Last year was recognized by the United Nations as the international year of the co-operative. By definition, co-operatives are enterprises owned and controlled by the very members they serve. Their member-driven nature means that decisions made in co-operatives are balanced by the pursuit of economic success and the needs and interests of members and their communities. With a billion members worldwide, co-operatives have a tremendous economic impact. They are also recognized for their cultural contributions, the values they promote, and the communities they develop. The International Co-operative Alliance has high hopes for co-operatives. In their document \"Blueprint for a Co-operative Decade,\" they set their intention to have co-operatives become the fastest growing sector in the economy by 2020. I like that idea and, as a local resident and co-op enthusiast, wanted to share an overview of the co-operative scene in Ann Arbor. Like any human endeavor, co-ops have their leaders and heroes, but in the spirit of \"we did it together,\" the story of Ann Arbor's co-ops is truly that of all of their members. I sat down with a number of co-operators to talk about their co-ops and why co-operatives matter to them. What I found was a group of creative and engaged Ann Arborites, among them an organizer, an historian, a board member, an employee who rose to management, and a worker/member whose life is touched by several co-operative ventures. Their co-ops include housing programs, grocers, credit unions, artist collectives, and schools, and each contribute uniquely to shaping the character of our town.

Seated: Jim Jones, Eppie Potts, Leticia Valdez With a billion members worldwide, co-operatives have a tremendous economic impact. They are also recognized for their cultural contributions, the values they promote, and the communities they develop.The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2013 Page 33 Jim Jones Ann Arbor's Inter-Co-operative Council, or ICC, is a student group that owns and operates 19 houses. Most of the houses offer group living. On average, each house has just less than 30 people living together and sharing meals and household chores. Many have their own unique character; for example, three houses are vegetarian, one is a graduate student house, and one house identifies as substance free. Jim Jones was the General Manager of the ICC from 1985 to 1999. Jim is a tall and trim, easygoing guy. He speaks deliberately with a voice you imagine has the slightest hint of Texas drawl, perhaps picked up during the eight years he spent organizing co-ops in Austin. For over 50 years Jim has been involved with student housing co-operatives. Wha t does he like about co-ops? \"I've seen so many people who have grown and really benefited from co-operatives.\" In working with young people Jim has seen how they are often at the mercy of their parents, the landlord, or a boss. In co-ops, they have the opportunity to gain some control in their lives \"if they want to exercise it.\" Jim estimates that maybe 20 percent of student co-op members take this opportunity. When they do, they can gain confidence and an understanding of how they can make a difference. Of course, gaining control in a co-op is something done alongside others, and Jim pointed out how group living also helps people grow. \"Life changes in a group setting.... Dealing with other people creates opportunities to step out of a role,\" he said. Jim first moved into a co-operative house in the University of Michigan ICC housing system in 1962. He came to embrace the co-op model a few years later in an argument with a libertarian. The libertarian's assumptions were that humans were self-centered and self-serving. Jim realized the co-operative worldview allowed for altruism, interpersonal co-operation, and mutual benefit. What are those mutual benefits? According to Jim, there are three reasons why people get involved in co-operatives, what he calls the three C's: cost, community, and control. People like all three of these benefits but tend to favor one more than others, depending on their situation. When the economy is bad there tends to be Ann Arbor's Inter-Co-operative Council, or ICC, is a student group that owns and operates 19 houses. \"Life changes in a group setting.... Dealing with other people creates opportunities to step out of a role.\" -Jim Jones Ann Arbor's Inter-Co-operative Council Continued on page 34 The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2013 Page 34 more of an emphasis on cost and affordability. Other times people are drawn to co- operatives for the element of community. For most people, the issue of control is more of a learned benefit. When Jim says \"control,\" he's talking about democracy and the opportunity to participate in self-governance. Co-ops work better, he said, when people learn about democratic participation just as things are getting set up, at the start of co-op membership. In the early seventies, Jim attended graduate school in art education at Michigan State and lived in an independent co-operative house there. During that time, he found himself at a meeting to discuss linking together a handful of co-operative houses that existed in East Lansing. Though he attended the meeting just to say hi to Luther Buchele, a man who used to run the ICC, he left the meeting president of a new organization. For three years he helped to organize and run the East Lansing student co-ops, launching his career as a student co-op organizer. From East Lansing, Jim moved to Texas for eight years to work with student co-ops in Austin. Finally, in 1982, Jim returned to Ann Arbor, first to work with the North American Students of Co-operation (NASCO), then as executive director of the ICC, and then again with NASCO. Jim has a passion and a talent for developing new co-operative houses. Although he claims that much of his success has meant being at the right place at the right time, he's likely helped create more co-operative student housing in North America than anyone else. He's known for thinking creatively about the possibilities. Perhaps this is where his art background pays off. A great story about his creative wheeling and dealing marked the first purchase he helped the ICC make in 1986. The people of Siddha Yoga Dham had approached him about trying to sell their ashram on Hill Street. For history buffs, these were the houses that belonged to John Sinclair and The Rainbow People's Party, a nexus of 60's radicalism. The deal involved placing an early bid that was honored in spite of later bids for more money; selling a dysfunctional co-operative house to a fraternity that had limited collateral; refinancing a federal loan with a 50 percent discount; lawyers flying from DC in the midst of a hurricane to close a deal one day before a federal deadline; and passing a plan to gradually raise co-op member fees so that members would tolerate the change. The deal succeeded with a mix of creativity and serendipity. Refinancing the federal loan then freed the ICC to purchase another six buildings while Jim was the executive director. Although Jim Jones retired from NASCO in 2010, he is still very much involved in the co-op movement. He started the organization Allen Creek Consulting to help NASCO with housing development, and has since branched out to offer broader co-operative support services. He is working on a movie with his son about the strength of the co-ops in the Austin area. He just helped a group of people close on a co-operative house in Grand Rapids, Michigan, and he has started a statewide co-operative networking organization. Wha t keeps him going? He said, \"I have an ecological sense for how co-operatives work. The ICC was started 75 years ago. You may not know the people who started a co-operative; you may not know who will live there in the future. I've met people from the 30's and 40's who benefited from it, and I've met people whose lives today are changed for the better.\" Asked about his thoughts on the Ann Arbor area today, Jim said there is a need for more co-ops -- for the spirit of co-ops to be an integral part of the zeitgeist in the coming years. He said we need a movement that asks, how do we see ourselves as a forward thinking community and how we can work together to solve our problems? Certainly co-ops are part of the answer.Eppie Potts Co-ops can be divided into two types: consumer co-ops, where the owners are the consumers, and producer co-ops, institutions owned by people who are producing something. While most of the co-ops in Ann Arbor are consumer co-ops, The Potters Guild is a producer co-op. More specifically, it is a craft co-op that provides resources to support its members but doesn't employ them. The P otters Guild first formed in 1949 when about 10 people hired a teacher to offer them private ceramic lessons. They set up a little ceramic studio that they ran as a co-op and have been producing pottery ever since. The Guild now has about 40 members and offers classes to 30 students.For most people the issue of control is more of a learned benefit.

Lives of Co-operation: A Look at Some of the People Who Are Making our Local Co-operatives Happen Continued from page 33The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2013 Page 35 Not many institutions of this size can boast of having a resident historian, but The Potters Guild can \u2014 with the apropos name of Eppie Potts. Now in her eighties, Eppie is a short woman who's effervescent and entertaining to talk with. She is very enthusiastic about the Guild and is also engaged in a lot of activities around town. She is active on the City Planning Commission and, in 2009, was nominated as Ann Arbor's Citizen of the Year. Eppie w as the first person to ask the original Guild members if she could be involved with them. It was 1950 and she asked if they offered public classes. At that point they didn't, but it was a provocative question, and so they decided to start. Eppie said of her initial experience with the Guild, \"It was like having 10 mother hens. They were extremely helpful.\" When I ask ed Eppie if I could interview her, she insisted we meet at the studio on Hill Street. Tucked between Fingerle Lumber and a row of residential houses, I almost missed the attractive vine-covered ceramic studio. Originally a foundry, the building was purchased in 1963 with funds raised through Guild members contributing half of their proceeds from pottery sales. Two additions have been built onto the original building. Eppie showed me their two electric kilns and two gas kilns and the place out back where they do Raku firings, a traditional Japanese technique that involves open fires. Eppie acknowledged that Raku firings always make the folks at Fingerle Lumber a little nervous. \" The Potters Guild is a co-op, but most members don't think of ourselves that way,\" Eppie explained. With a large number of Guild members working in a limited space \"we have to co-operate.\" Eppie is very proud of the Guild's work system. She tells me it developed around the question, what is the one thing everybody wants? The answer: access to the kiln. In order to have access to space in the kiln, Guild members must put in a certain amount of work toward the Guild's needs. This includes everything from being on committees to maintaining the building to firing kilns. Different jobs are apportioned a different number of points based on their popularity. For instance, unloading clay into the storage area is heavy lifting and gets a lot of points. Although Eppie doesn't tell me directly, I later learn that she was on the three-person committee in the early 1960s that developed the labor points system. \"Not everyone is equally co-operative by nature,\" she observed, \"but, because nobody can buy their way into the kiln, the point system works.\" Guild member s also pay an annual operations fee. This covers the cost of all the clay they can use. Most members generally don't make their living by making pottery at the Guild. Eppie estimated that some members might make as much as several thousand dollars a year in income, but that's on the high side. Those ceramicists who do make a living from their work might have a separate studio. For instance, Kate Tremel is a Potters Guild member, and at the Guild's semi-annual sale you can see her work, but she said she doesn't do a whole lot with the Guild. She has a studio in her house and sometimes teaches ceramics at the University. JB Abernathy, one of Ann Arbor's most famous ceramicists, was a friend of The Potters Guild for many years, but only joined after he retired and closed down his own studio. The Guild studio is limited on space but because the building is paid for and built out to the extent city permitting will allow it is unlikely to expand. This limits the number of members who can participate. To join the Guild, a person's work has to be evaluated, and then the person is voted in by members. New members are usually students who have taken Guild classes. According to Eppie, those who haven't experienced classes often don't work out as members because they don't understand the co-operative culture of The Potters Guild. She told the story of a potter who came from another town and joined the Guild. She had been coming in at night and, one night, Eppie was there and tried a few times to strike up a conversation. After a couple of grumpy responses, this new member said, \"Can't you see that the reason I came in at night was because I didn't want to talk to anyone?\" Well, it wasn't long before she parted ways with The Potters Guild. Although, as Eppie said, \"not everyone is equally co-operative,\" she also said, \"The nature of The Potters Guild is that it tends to attract artists who are sociable and can work well with others.\" In order to have access to space in the kiln, Guild members must put in a certain amount of work toward the Guild's needs.\"The nature of The Potters Guild is that it tends to attract artists who are sociable and can work well with others.\" -Eppie P otts, The Potters Guild historian Continued on 36 A2YOGA.NET 7 34.21 6.4006 2030 COMMERCE BL VD ANN ARBOR VOTED ANN ARBOR'S BEST YOGA STUDIO LIVING THE LIGHT WITHIN The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2013 Page 36 Leticia Valdez The co-operative spirit is something that lends itself easily to families and education and there are at least five co-op nursery schools in Ann Arbor. The oldest of these was founded in 1938. Although there are small differences between them, these co-ops are all structured fairly similarly. Typically, the programs have hired teachers but also count on volunteer help from parents. Programming includes classes for three-year-olds and four-year-olds, and occasional fill-in programs for five-year-olds who are too young for enrollment in kindergarten. Programming is two or three days for any given age group. Parents are expected to volunteer a certain amount each semester. With the volunteer involvement, co-op schools are more affordable than other daycare programs. While the programs don't meet the needs of families seeking full-time childcare, they typically work well for families with a stay-at-home parent or two parents working part-time. Le ticia Valdez is a parent of two young children, ages seven and four. Her four-year- old is enrolled in the First United Methodist Co-op Nursery, or FUMCN (fum-kin), located on State Street across from campus, and her seven-year-old is a graduate of the program. Although she is new to Ann Arbor, Leticia's family is not entirely new to this nursery school. Her husband attended there when he was a child. One of the ways Leticia volunteers for FUMCN is working on design of their web page, fumcnpreschool.org. She has also served on the board of directors for three years and as the chair of the publicity committee. The committees are comprised of groups of parents who get the work done. The 12-member board is in charge of running the operations of the school and meets once a month to decide on everything from school policy to how to get sand for the sand box. Parents also volunteer as classroom assistants. Leticia pointed out, \"Some parents really like to participate with their children, and co-op preschools help with making the transition to school by providing a daycare program that involves the parents in the care.\" FUMCN, which w as started in the early 1960s, is sponsored by the First United Methodist Church and housed in the church building. Still, they welcome families of all religious backgrounds and encourage the sharing of different cultures and religions. Although the curriculum is fairly secular, thank you prayers are offered before snack time. If you include the program for young five-year-olds, this daycare has nearly 70 students. FUMCN has a staff of six teachers and assistants. In t alking about cultural diversity, Leticia mentioned, \"Last year the FUMCN program offered a once a week Spanish class.\" Perhaps this was possible because a number of Spanish-speaking families have children enrolled in the nursery school. Leticia also noted the co-op's diversity reflects that of Ann Arbor and attracts many international families. When I talked to the president of the Stone School Co-operative Nursery, another co-op nursery in town, she also said they have many international families who are part of their co-op. Leticia moved to Ann Arbor with her husband for his residency program in 2009. She works part time doing Information Technology work for the University. Before moving here, she felt that as a mom with young children moving to Michigan from California it would be challenging to connect with the Ann Arbor community. Once here, she found that FUMCN was \"a great place to meet other like-minded folks. Kids develop friends and then you find other parents with similar values.\" The preschool has offered her a quick route to community. Leticia and her husband are part of an informal social group that formed from FUMCN parents. Once every other month the parents go out for a couples date night. The daycare also has an informal email list that is used for barter and exchange, impromptu gatherings, and referrals.

Today it has over 50,000 members.The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2013 Page 37 Elgin Batie, Jr. A credit union is a financial co-operative. There are over 7,000 credit unions in the United States, and nearly a million members. Nationwide their assets exceed one trillion dollars, which is about seven percent of the total financial assets held by financial institutions. A handful of credit unions have local branches in Ann Arbor, but the University of Michigan Credit Union is based in Ann Arbor and is probably the best known around town. The University of Michigan Credit Union started in 1954 with 12 members. Today it has over 50,000 members. In 1987, Elgin Batie, Jr. was studying computer science and math with a minor in art at Eastern Michigan University. He was also working for the county sheriff as a reserve deputy. His wife insisted that no guns should be in the house once they started having children. That kind of nixed the deputy job. Elgin thought he should get a job doing computer work to find out if that was the right career for him. He didn't know anything about co-ops or credit unions at that time, but he applied for a job as a computer operator for the University of Michigan Credit Union. It turned out that the position was part-time and he was looking for a full-time job, so the Credit Union gave him a full-time position as a teller, which he did for three months until a full-time computer operator position opened up. This was at a time when computer networking was just getting started. Elgin grew with the position, getting certified in networking. He became an assistant manager for I.T., though \"it wasn't called I.T. back then.\" For a while he worked with a credit union service organization that was a wholly owned subsidiary of the University of Michigan Credit Union, a co-operative venture among credit unions that was focused on providing support for ATMs, check processing, and collection. Then he returned to the University of Michigan Credit Union as branch manager of the North Campus branch. While in that position he was also in charge of security, and this evolved into his present position as the security and fraud manager. As he put it, working in security and fraud felt like coming back around to his early days in law enforcement.It's hard to imagine a more jovial manager of security and fraud. He is quick to laugh and there is a warmth about him and an appreciation of fun. Elgin shares the favorite quotes of the Credit Union's C.E.O. Tiffany Ford: \"Work hard, play hard\" and \"Teamwork makes the dream work.\" Although Ms. Ford is a relatively recent C.E.O. for the Credit Union, her quotes reflect what Elgin likes about his job. He said, \"The culture is more relaxed and you are encouraged to do your best. There is support and training, lots of training.\" He added, \"When individuals come to work at the Credit Union from banks you see the change.\" This is because banks are sales oriented. Elgin told me his friend who works at a bank is always stressed because she is expected to open a certain number of accounts daily. Alternately, most credit unions aren't trying to sell you something but are there to assist their members and not to make a sales quota. \"We talk a lot about serving our members. Credit unions are about people serving people. We strive to live up to that philosophy.\" Elgin recounted a story from a credit union management training program that he participated in. The program included a community outreach day when credit union managers spent the day fixing up homes of people in need. People were so moved by the experience that many of them came back in tears. \"That,\" said Elgin, \"was a good way of expressing people helping people.\" He is also quick to share a list of over fifty organizations and events that the University of Michigan Credit Union has sponsored or contributed to in the past year alone. This commitment to service falls in line with the motto of credit unions: \"Not for profit, not for charity, but for service.\" With a focus on service, credit unions tend to be more cautious than banks. Like many credit unions, University of Michigan Credit Union did not get caught up in the mortgage crisis of 2008 and it never needed TARP bailout money. Although Elgin acknowledged differences between the Credit Union and conventional banks, he expressed that he prefers to focus more on the strengths of credit unions. The Credit Union has grown slowly since Elgin first was hired. Its number of employees has grown from around 80 to nearly 120. In 1987, there was only one branch. Today there are six branches in Ann Arbor and one branch in Dearborn. With a focus on service, credit unions tend to be more cautious than banks. Like many credit unions, University of Michigan Credit Union did not get caught up in the mortgage crisis of 2008 and it never needed TARP bailout money. It's hard to imagine a more jovial manager of security and fraud. Batie is quick to laugh and there is a warmth about him and an appreciation of fun.1 Billion Co-op Members Worldwide The Worldwatch Institute issued a report last year providing some statistics on co-op membership worldwide. The actual report has accompanying charts and graphs, and is heavily footnoted. It is available through vitalsigns.worldwatch.org Here are some excerpts:Co-operatives are low-profile but powerful economic actors, with the world' s 300 largest ones generating revenues in 2008 of more than $1.6 trillion.At the global level, 29 percent of the 300 largest co-operatives worldwide are agricultural co-ops, 26 percent are banks and credit unions, and 22 percent are retailers and wholesalers. Other sectors represented include insurance, manufacturing, health, and utilities. Although less well known than mainstream corporations, the co-operative model is widespread and by at least one measure surpasses shareholder corporations: the 1 billion member-owners of co-operatives worldwide exceed the 893 million shareholders of corporations. Member-owner dominance of business ownership is found particularly in developing regions of the world. The Global 300 major co-operatives and mutual businesses are located in 25 countries, largely in the industrial world. But an estimated 7 percent of Africans belong to a co-operative, and their numbers are growing rapidly. The number of co-ops registered in Uganda, for example, grew 13-fold between 1995 and 2008\u2014from 554 to nearly 7,500. Savings and credit co-operatives in particular are thriving in Africa. In many countries, co-operatives have a high societal profile. In some advanced industrial countries, co-ops generate a meaningful share of economic output: 21 percent in Finland, 17.5 percent in New Zealand, 16.4 percent in Switzerland, and 13 percent in Sweden. And in some countries a sizable share of the population\u2014up to 70 percent\u2014belongs to a co-operative of one sort or another. A 2010 World Bank report found that credit union branches account for 23 percent of bank branches worldwide and serve 870 million people, making them the second largest financial services network in the world. And in a few countries\u2014Austria, Burundi, Germany, Hungary, South Korea, and Spain\u2014branches of co-operative banks outnumber those of commercial banks. Similarly for insurance: more than 30 percent of the market in the five largest insurance markets globally is controlled by mutual and co-op firms. Co-operatives in the financial sector are valuable because they of fer access to savings, loans, and other financial services to small and medium enterprises, particularly in rural areas, which lowers a key barrier to economic development in the poorest sectors of many economies. Some 45 percent of the branches of co-ops are located in rural areas, for example, compared with 26 percent of branches of commercial banks. \"We talk a lot about serving our members. Credit unions are about people serving people. We strive to live up to that philosophy.\" -Elgin Batie Continued on page 38Lives of Co-operation: A Look at Some of the People Who Are Making our Local Co-operatives HappenThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2013 Page 38 Kevin Quinn I have been a member of the People's Food Co-op since I moved to town in 1980, and for the past three years have served on its board of directors.

With his tight curly hair, warm smile, and easy direct eye contact, Kevin is a focused and friendly part of the People's Food Co-op produce team. He has worked at the Co-op in the produce department for almost seven years. Kevin used to be a schoolteacher, first in Detroit, then for five years in Portland, Oregon. It was in Portland that Kevin first got involved in co-ops as a shopper at a grocery co-op, coincidentally also called People's Food Co-op. The Portland co-op had a generous volunteer program that allowed co-op owners to volunteer more and receive a greater discount on store purchases. (The Ann Arbor People's Food Co-op had a volunteer program like this but discontinued it due to potential legal concerns.) Kevin liked several things about the Portland co-op. One was that the money he spent would support a co-op and, ultimately, profit the members, including him. He was also trying to get away from excessive consumerism. As he put it, \"As a consumer, I didn't need a lot of stuff, but the stuff I needed I could get from the Co-op.\" He was becoming conscious of his food's sources. This was at a time of growing concern about genetically engineered foods and food safety, and there was less of what he calls \"organic junk food.\" Kevin also found that his food choices allowed him to be part of something \u2014 a community. He enjoyed saying hi to the people he knew at the Co-op. The store had a community feeling. When he returned to Ann Arbor, Kevin wanted to do something other than teaching. He saw a job posting at the People's Food Co-op that led to a position in the produce department. Soon he was assistant manager, and then manager of the produce department for three and a half years. Kevin's belief in the positive impact of his buying power strengthened by working in the produce department. Knowing the \"back story,\" he likes being able to share information with shoppers and feels he has made decisions that supported co-op principles and the local economy.Last year the People's Food Co-op was in the process of selecting a new general manager. Although Kevin thought about applying and some of those involved in the selection process thought he would be a good candidate, he decided against that move because, as he put it, \"flipping roles with my former boss felt uncomfortable.\" Instead, last June Kevin quit his position as produce manager but continues to work half-time in the produce department. He made this change in order to work with David Klingenberger at The Brinery, Ann Arbor's premiere fermented foods manufacturer. Although The Brinery is not a co-operative, it is involved in a project called the Washtenaw Food Hub. While still in its formative stages, the Food Hub is considering operating as a co-operative of local food businesses and farms. As a site for storing and processing food, at the very least, the Food Hub will be promoting co-operation among local food initiatives. For Kevin, working at The Brinery is an opportunity to do something new and interesting while further promoting the local food movement. Kevin's involvement with co-ops extends to his housing choice. He is a resident of Arrowwood Hills, a complex of 350 townhouses collectively owned as a limited equity co-operative. Arrowwood was originally funded with a HUD loan and for forty years the terms of the loan required the housing complex to run as a co-operative. In 2011, the loan was paid off and members had an opportunity to vote on the ownership structure. To change from the co-op structure that Arrowwood had operated under might have allowed members to sell their units for whatever the market would bear, but the people at Arrowwood enjoyed it as a place to live and appreciated the value of community greater than market returns. Arrowwood is one of five HUD funded housing co-ops in Ann Arbor. Of the five, all but one have voted to retain their co-op structure. Kevin moved into Arrowwood in 2006 by coincidence. He wasn't looking for a co-op, but the monthly charges were low and, although he doesn't know where every dollar goes, he trusts the people who run Arrowwood. As he put it, \"For what you pay, the property is nice, and payments are not making one owner rich.\" Kevin values the way co-ops let you be a part of something bigger than yourself, magnifying your impact. He seems to have the co-op bug and is also a member of the University of Michigan Credit Union. As Kevin put it, \"Banks get a bad rap, but my credit union is not nickel and diming me. Its purpose is not to make money but to meet consumer needs.\" I first got to know Kevin when, for a year or so, our families were part of a co- operative dinner group. Five families took turns hosting dinners at their home every two weeks. Finally Kevin told me about the smallest co-op I've ever heard of, a two member \"co-op,\" \"The Bean Co-op\" he established with a neighbor. Observing that it takes about as long to cook two pots of beans as it takes to cook one, Kevin and his neighbor worked out an agreement where they take turns cooking beans. Once you have the co-op spirit everything becomes an opportunity for mutual aid. Concluding Thoughts From their views and experiences, each of these co-opers offers insights into what makes co-ops great and what makes co-ops work. If Jim Jones has a message, it is that co-ops create an environment that nurtures empowerment and that democratic participation makes a difference. Eppie Potts' history shows that even if people are not all equally co-operative, with fair rules, people can co-operate equally. Leticia Valdez's experience is that co-ops can be a doorway to community. Elgin's co-op motto seemed to be people helping people. Although Elgin's perspective was as an employee rather than a member, he exemplified how co-operatives can be great businesses to work for. Finally, Kevin extolls the virtues of accountability and transparency that co-ops can offer. His life is also an example of the way co-ops can meet many of an individual's needs. The International Co-operative Alliance has a goal for co-ops worldwide, but what about here in Ann Arbor and southeast Michigan? Can co-operatives become the fastest growing sector of our local economy by 2020? Perhaps they can become intrinsic to the spirit of the times, the zeitgeist, that Jim talks about. Co-ops have a lot to offer and there are local signs of hope. Many of the co-ops that have been around for decades are going strong. In the past year or so, I've heard about a number of co-operative start-up projects. Nonetheless, the success of our local co-ops depends on the support and participation of local folks. Fastest growing sector by 2020? Together we can!Continued from page 37 Kevin's belief in the positive impact of his buying power strengthened by working in the produce department.

We hear them in newscasts, television and radio ads, documentaries, and feature length movies. Depending on whom you listen to, natural gas will save the country or will threaten our water supply and public health; it's a bridge or it's a gangplank. While one short article can't sort through all of the arguments, here are some basics and how they play out in Michigan. What is hydraulic fracturing? Hydraulic fracturing, or \"fracking,\" is a process for extracting natural gas from tight shale formations. Unlike conventional wells, where the gas collects in porous layers of rock, the gas in shale is trapped within tiny pores. In order for the gas to flow freely, these pores must be fractured and propped open, using a mixture of liquid and sand forced into the well under high pressure. Fracking has been around for some fifty years. However, this latest gas boom accesses deep shale layers previously considered economically infeasible through four technologies: Dir ectional drilling: Drilling to depths of 9,000 feet or more and then turning to drill horizontally 5,000 feet or more, accessing more of the trapped gas in a single drilling event. High fr acking fluid volumes: Forcing 3-7 million gallons of water, sand, and chemicals at very high pressure down the well to fracture small fissures into larger ones. \"Slick\" w ater: Adding chemicals to the water as friction reducers, biocides, and gels to maintain flow and fracturing over the long drilling distance. Multi-w ell pads: Horizontal drilling in multiple directions off the same well pad. What are the concerns? The entire process, from drilling, fracturing, extracting, processing, and transporting the gas, has evoked serious concerns about its impact on the environment. W ater Quantity: Wells may be fracked once or many times, each time using 3-7 million gallons of water (this is the typically cited quantity, but two wells in Kalkaska County recently reported using 21 million and 16 million gallons). In Michigan, this water is usually obtained from local ground water wells drilled on site. Some of the water is returned to the surface and some remains underground. In either case, because of the chemical additives, the water is lost to the hydrologic cycle. Nonetheless, oil and gas drilling are exempt from the state's water withdrawal law. The Michigan Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) has in the past year begun requiring companies to use the state's Water Withdrawal Assessment Tool as part of the permitting process, but that information is not subsequently registered in the state's water withdrawal database for study of cumulative effects. W ater Quality: The chemical additives make up only about 1 percent of the fracking fluid, but in millions of gallons of water that can add up to thousands of gallons of chemicals. Some are relatively benign, but others, such as benzene, xylene, and ethylene glycol, can be quite toxic. The particular mix of chemicals is often treated as a trade secret and not made known to the public. The returning water also picks up substances in the shale, such as barium, lead, chromium, and Naturally Occurring Radioactive Materials (NORMs). In Michigan, the water is disposed of in deep injection wells. Could these chemic als reach local surface or ground water? The induced fractures could spread to naturally occurring fractures or to nearby active or abandoned wells and migrate into the water table. A more likely source of contamination is failure of the protective cement well casings inside the wells. Poor quality cementing or stresses from the pressure during fracking could produce leaks in the casing. Data reported by the state of Pennsylvania indicated that, for wells drilled in 2010 and 2011, about 6 percent exhibited casing failures. Finally, contamination can occur from surface spills, leaking tanks, faulty valves, or from intentional releases. In spring of 2012, the DEQ approved and a month later rescinded permission for flowback \"brine\" from a Kalkaska well to be sprayed on gravel roads for dust control. Air Quality: T ruck traffic, diesel generators, and gas venting or flaring generate air pollution. Pollutants include volatile organic compounds, methane, and hydrogen sulfide. Rural Sublette County in Wyoming, with 27,000 gas wells, has recorded ozone levels higher than Los Angeles. Na tural gas (methane) has been touted as a cleaner alternative to coal. At the point where it is burned and converted to carbon dioxide, it is cleaner, albeit still a fossil fuel. However, methane is a green house gas 22 times more effective at trapping heat than carbon dioxide, and when methane leakage en route from the drill site to the power plant is taken into account, the total green house gas effect can be identical to coal. A recent Colorado study by NOAA found as much as 9 percent of the methane from the production process was leaked or vented. Surf ace Impacts: Five-acre well pads, along with roads, compressor stations, and pipelines, produce habitat fragmentation in forested areas. The noise, lights, truck traffic, machinery, and processing facilities can turn a rural area into an industrial zone. What's happening in Michigan? Fracking has occurred in Michigan since 1952, predominantly in shallow (600-2,200 feet deep) vertical wells in Antrim shale. Beginning in 2010, using the new technologies, interest developed in the deeper (5,000-12,000 feet deep) Utica-Collingwood shale plays. The DEQ lists 53 active Utica-Collingwood permits, mostly in the northern Lower Peninsula. The current low natural gas prices have temporarily slowed the pace of new gas wells in favor of more lucrative oil wells. Oil drilling has been the focus in the southern Lower Peninsula. Since 2009, some 60 wells have been drilled in Jackson County, with a line of development between Jackson and Adrian, including the Irish Hills area. Leasing is also beginning in Washtenaw County. In May and October of 2012, the state auctioned off thousands of acres of mineral rights in state recreation areas \u2014 mostly for oil drilling \u2014 many in Barry, Livingston, and Oakland counties. For the most part, this oil exists in a geologic layer that does not require hydraulic fracturing as yet. While it does not require the volumes of water and chemicals needed for deep shale fracking, many of the same concerns exist around potential spills, leaks, blowouts, methane flaring, truck traffic, noise, and waste disposal. In Michigan, the state controls regulation of oil and gas wells, with no formal process for citizen input. Local communities can set restrictions on setbacks, noise, and hours of operation, using public health and safety concerns, but may be caught off guard by a sudden leasing boom. States like Ohio and Pennsylvania have shown that communities and property owners may find it difficult and divisive to weigh the company's (often rosy) economic promises from leasing against the potential impact on public health and safety, community infrastructure, water, and property values. Weighing risks and benefits always comes down to whose risks and whose benefits. Michigan has the highest number of households on private water wells. More than 50 percent of Michigan's population depends on groundwater for its drinking water supply. When it is your water supply that is contaminated, reading a risk analysis is small comfort. Compared to states like Pennsylvania and Colorado, Michigan is in the early stages of the oil and natural gas boom. We are still in a position to make decisions about energy production and usage in the state. We have options to focus on renewable energy rather than more fossil fuels. Now is the time for citizen voices to be heard.

The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2013 Page 40 \"Sustainability\" is today's buzzword for lifestyle practices that include organic food-growing, eating locally grown food, green building, recycling and reusing, permaculture practices, and fair trade. Here is one dictionary definition: \" Sustainability : from the verb to sustain, meaning: to hold up; to bear; to support; to provide for; to maintain; sanction; to keep going; to keep up; to prolong\" (retrieved from www.houstonlwsforum.org). How might sustainability be expressed when we apply this concept holistically to a human life? Wouldn't a life that we love be the most sustainable one? We can begin by looking at how we raise our children. When I had my first baby, I was fascinated by her approach to the world \u2014 being still pure and healthy, she was so present always, and explored her environment with a sense of wonder, awe, enchantment, and enthusiasm. She had not yet been given any other lens, and I wanted to protect this joyful experience for her. Thus began our homeschooling experiment. I simply allowed my children to direct their own education, with life as the curriculum and permission to explore whatever most interested them. I hung a quote in our kitchen that read, \"All children should have the right to learn what they want, when they want, how they want, and where they want.\" My role was simply to make the world available to them, to facilitate the learning they requested, to care for them, and to offer guidance when needed. As long as they honored our code of respect, they were free to make the most of their own decisions. Other parents would ask me how I could keep up with all the work of homeschooling, and I would shrug and say, \"It's easy \u2014 the kids learn naturally, doing what they're drawn to do, and everyone is happy.\" It felt very sustainable to me.When we teach all children the same subjects, at the same time, in schools separated from life , what kind of sustainability are we aiming for? It's a whole lot of work (often dreaded) for everyone involved, and what kind of adults are we creating? Where is the freshness, the heart-centeredness, the self-directed originality and aliveness that creates a real sense of renewal? Maybe this approach \"prolongs and keeps something going\" as the dictionary defines sustainability, but what kind of energy are we prolonging? It's a good question to ask. Once I felt my way into homeschooling, I began to question a lot of things about how we choose to live. One area that especially fascinates me is our food choices. I started to look to nature for my answers, rather than to \"expert\" opinions. With nature as my teacher, a diet of fresh uncooked, unprocessed food made the most sense. Eating in this way quickly opened up more questions about how I was living. People saw the positive, life-changing results I was getting and began to look to me as a raw-food coach. I quickly learned that I really needed to be a life coach, because soon after adopting a raw-food diet, my clients' lives began to open to change, as mine had. People see their life through a new lens as their bodies cleanse and heal. By eating only the foods Mother Nature has provided and intended for us, a connection to our source is renewed. As our body starts to feel better than we can remember, we begin to notice more acutely the places in our lives where we have disconnected from the very basics of what creates nature's synergy and the cyclic sustainability of life. With the numbing sludge of toxic and inappropriate foods removed from our cells, and vibrant new cells being birthed from more available nutrients, we begin to crave more sunshine, fresh air, and contact with the earth, the plants, our heart, and our fellow beings. We see more clearly where we have dishonored our heart and soul, and where we have strayed from our natural, inner birthright of love and joy, awe and enchantment. We gather the strength and clarity to reconsider the choices we have made that may not have fully honored our divinity. We catch a glimpse of what it feels like to be truly alive and enlivened, and we want more of this feeling. A properly planned raw vegan diet can be a fast-track ticket to this powerful new level of self-awareness and clarity. With the right fuel in our bodies (fuel and nutrition is, after all, what nature intended our food for), a huge amount of energy is freed up because it is no longer needed for the challenge of dealing with unwanted and inappropriate foodstuffs. A cleaner, lighter, more optimally functioning body is the beautiful temple we were intended to have \u2014 one in which our mental, emotional, and spiritual bodies can live and thrive. Eating the most natural foods, growing much of our own food, and taking good care of our collective resources goes a long way toward making our bodies feel good and our lives feel valuable, purposeful, and connected. But sustainability is, at its very core, about helping each other to live heart-centered, joyous lives, connected to our source, and doing what we love. And love is what makes the world go 'round \u2014 and 'round \u2014 sustainably. Have you ever felt that something was missing in your life, even when things seemed to be going well? That something is often hard to articulate, but it is exactly the piece we need to recover if we want to be an expression of a truly sustainable life. I believe we are designed to live in a state of perfect health and pure joy, as the wild animals do. Our complex human experience greatly challenges this, but with willingness, openness, and commitment, we can reunite with our Self and our source, and we can embody our naturally joyful aliveness again. Ask yourself this: if money were no object, if you didn't care what other people might think of your choices, and if you knew you couldn't fail, what would you truly love to do? By the way, \"failure\" is the backbone of success. If we aren't having frequent failures, we probably aren't really living fully. Failure is simply feedback that helps us to grow. It's all part of the cycle of living sustainably. I know from my own experience that when I am at my peak health, and when I am letting my heart lead me to make choices for what I would really love, that is when I feel most radiantly alive, and that is when my life feels joyfully, easily sustainable. When I feel this good, I am most available to give my unique gifts freely in service to my fellow beings \u2014 sustainable, loving service.

Local Beekeepers Combine a Fascinating Hobby with an Altruistic Goal \u2014 Helping Bees Survive and ThriveThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2013 Page 43 By Sandor Slomovits Photos By Doug Russell Even those of us who have been city dwellers for most our lives are likely to have at least a cursory knowledge of the critical role honeybees play in our world. We've all delighted in the incomparable taste of honey, may have enjoyed the warm, beautiful light and fragrance of beeswax candles, or maybe benefited from the healing properties of salves containing beeswax. Possibly we know that a large percentage of human agriculture is dependent on bees for pollination, and we likely have heard of colony collapse disorder, the mysterious affliction that has destroyed many honeybees since 2006. This article is not intended to convey all, or even many, of the amazing facts that entomologists and beekeepers have learned about honeybees, (although it is impossible to talk about bees without relating some of their incredible capabilities). Nor is it a review of what has been learned about colony collapse disorder and what is being done to address this tragedy. Rather, it is a series of small windows into the reflections, perceptions, observations, and experiences of a handful of local beekeepers. Anthea van Geloven and Jacob Warren are both 17, classmates at Rudolf Steiner High School, and helped found the organic gardening club there. This spring they began keeping bees in Anthea's family's front yard in South Lyon. Anthea's family has been doing small scale farming for years. They've raised goats, sheep, and chickens, and have a large vegetable garden. Anthea's mother, Gabriele, has considered raising bees ever since she first learned of their troubles six years ago. Jacob, too, has \"entertained the idea of keeping bees for years. However, it's never been feasible due to my urban setting.\" They originally intended to have only one hive, but before their mail order bees arrived, a wild swarm moved into the empty hive they'd set up. \"We felt this incredible excitement for the bees to come, this deep longing and love,\" says Gabriele, \"so when the wild swarm arrived we were just in awe. I think they heard our call.\" They promptly bought another hive and filled it with the mail order bees. The activity was, \"One of the most incredible experiences of my life,\" says Anthea. The novice beekeepers have been learning from books, videos, and other beekeepers. Jacob says, \"Obviously there's still a lot that I don't know, things that require experience. To learn these things I'm relying on the bees to teach me over time.\" Gabriele says, \"We love being with them, just lying in the grass, listening to their humming and watching them working so hard. They totally humble me.\" Anthea adds, \"It's amazing how calm they make me feel when they're around me.\" They bought their hives from Jason Gold, who lives with his family on a small farm in Superior Township. Here he grows a variety of vegetables, fruits, and herbs; raises goats, chickens, and bees; and runs an organic animal feed buyers club (Ourhandmadelife.com). Jason is also an experienced woodworker, and last year began crafting hives based on principles he learned from Beekeeping for All , a book Anthea van Geloven and Jacob WarrenAnthea van Geloven \"We felt this incredible excitement for the bees to come, this deep longing and love... so when the wild swarm arrived, we were just in awe. I think they heard our call.\" - Gabriele van Geloven \"Rudolf Steiner penned in 1923 that if humanity continued to cultivate honeybees by artificial means, we would, by the end of the century, witness the mass disappearance of bees. It appears that when we fail to perceive the whole picture, and instead concentrate on the parts, our inventiveness falls short of the masterful way that nature creates and manages. \" - Jason Gold \"As I become more fluent in the language of the bees, I have started to remove my armor and meet them halfway.\" - Jason Gold Continued on page 44The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2013 Page 44 by Abb\u00e9 \u00c9mil Warr\u00e9. The design intends to mimic how bees create hives in nature. \"Rather than adding empty boxes to the top of the hive \u2014 as in conventional hives \u2014with a Warr\u00e9 hive, empty boxes are added to the bottom. This simple change successfully mimics the environment of a natural colony, as they will always build downward from the top of the cavity rather than upward. Additionally, a Warr\u00e9 hive is fitted with a shallow box called a quilt that is filled with wood shavings and added to the top of the hive, soaking up moisture and assisting in regulating the temperate of the hive. The hive does not need to be vented nor is it outfitted with frames.\" Surprisingly, given his current connection with bees, Jason \"swore off any involvement with bees\" after a painful sting at the age of 13. But, \"Years later, and heavily invested in the good food movement, I came across literature discussing the accounts of mysterious disappearances of honeybees around the world.\" Like Gabriele, he was determined to try to help, and began studying the available literature, in particular the holistic, biodynamic approach to agriculture pioneered by Rudolf Steiner. \"Steiner penned in 1923 that if humanity continued to cultivate honeybees by artificial means, we would, by the end of the century, witness the mass disappearance of bees. It appears that when we fail to perceive the whole picture, and instead concentrate on the parts, our inventiveness falls short of the masterful way that nature creates and manages.\" Besides crafting hives, Jason now also keeps bees and is helping others learn the art of beekeeping. \"While I am no longer afraid of a bee sting,\" he says, \"I still take suited precautions. Although, as I become more fluent in the language of the bees, I have started to remove my armor and meet them halfway.\" Dr. Malcolm Sickels, who practices integrative general and family medicine in Ann Arbor, began keeping bees three years ago. He explained: I wanted to start a hobby with my teenaged daughter. We didn't want to use any pesticides on our bees, so [we] have a bit of a sink or swim philosophy with them. When we started, there were few books about organic beekeeping, but we refused to apply all the chemicals that are recommended. Beekeepers are supposed to not apply chemicals when the bees are making honey for human consumption, but bees move stuff around all the time. I don't think there is a safe time to put chemicals on the hive. Even the wax will accumulate all the stuff that's in there. Our first year, the bees \u2014 we got some feral bees \u2014 barely made any honey. We started late in the summer and fed them as much as we could, but they had precious little reserves for the winter. Bees live off their honey during the winter and use the energy to keep warm. I put insulation on the hive and some sugar on top as a last resort, but figured the chance of them surviving was slim. Lo and behold, in early May, they made cleansing flights. They don't use the bathroom until it's warm enough; thus the cleansing flights that leave pollen-yellow spots in the snow, demonstrating that they survived the winter. We got two more hives that year and were able to harvest honey for the first time, but that first hive never produced enough honey to harvest. That following winter all three hives perished. One, the best producer, disappeared in the fall, and the other two didn't survive the winter. We got all new bees last year and all survived the very mild winter we just had. Malcolm's daughter, Linnea, has expanded their hobby and has begun to make cosmetics, lip balm, and moisturizer with chemical-free beeswax, organic olive oil, and Michigan mint. She also blogs on her website, linneassignature.com, about some national efforts to ban pesticides that may be contributing to colony collapse disorder. Rob Martens is a retired audio engineer and musician who started keeping bees as a hobby in his backyard five years ago after watching his friend, Andy McLaughlin, working with bees. He keeps two hives now and gives away almost all his honey to friends. Like every one of the beekeepers I talked with, he's fascinated with the life cycle of bees and their activities. His face becomes animated and his voice fills with wonder as he relates some amazing facts about bees: Five thousand trips \u2014 round trips \u2014 to make one teaspoon of honey. They're so organized, the community works so well together. One on one they don't do much, but together, they get all this stuff done. If it's too warm, they'll be at the top fanning the heat out. If it's too cold, they get around the queen and make energy, heat; they eat honey, turn it into heat to keep the queen warm. It's just staggering. They work so hard; they're an inspiration. It's enough to make you religious. Linnea Sickels \"Five thousand trips \u2014 round trips \u2014 to make one teaspoon of honey... They work so hard; they're an inspiration. It's enough to make you religious.\" - Rob Martens\"There is a reason they're disappearing. There are likely multiple issues; overworking them, carting them all over the country gets them disoriented, cell phones, pesticides, herbicides, pollution, and genetically modified crops may also be involved.\" - Rob Martens Meeting Them Halfway ~Local Beekeepers Combine a Fascinating Hobby with an Altruistic Goal \u2014 Helping Bees Survive and Thrive Continued from page 43The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2013 Page 45 Rob, like all the beekeepers I talked with, is saddened and concerned about the plight of bees: Colony collapse really affects the commercial beekeepers that truck their bees around the country. They have semis full of \u2014 I don't know how many \u2014 hundreds, thousands of hives. They start in Florida with the oranges and they go up the coast for the blueberries and then they take them over to California for the almonds. They don't even bother gathering the honey. Honey is the byproduct that they negotiate into the deal somehow, but it's way down the list after pollination. I ask him if all this carting around of bees is a necessity brought on by our giant orchards and agricultural monocultures. \"Absolutely,\" he says, adding: Before, when everything worked the way it's supposed to work, the farmers had their own hives, and the bees would come; maybe there weren't even hives, just a hole in a tree, and they'd go out and pollinate the crops. Scientists are saying the honeybees are just a little ahead of us; they're like the canary in the coalmines. There is a reason they're disappearing. There are likely multiple issues; overworking them, carting them all over the country gets them disoriented, cell phones, pesticides, herbicides, pollution, and genetically modified crops may also be involved. Rob's friend, Andy McLaughlin, is a foreman at Sure-Flo Fittings, a company that manufactures fittings for irrigation systems. His lifelong interest in bees dates back to his childhood when he learned how to find wild honeybees from a friend of his father. Rob recalled about Andy: He would capture a few bees, mark and release them. He'd check the direction they flew as they returned to their nest, and note the time that it took them to go and return to where he had captured them. The info he gathered in this way indicated the direction and distance to a nest. Then, he would track them down and remove them. At nine or ten years old his detective work fascinated me. When I talked with Andy, he told me that, years later, he \"bought some bees, proceeded to make about every mistake that can be made \u2014 [and] continue to make more than I should, but have a lot of fun doing it.\" Andy still captures wild swarms, though his most recent episode, earlier this spring, didn't involve any detective work. I was walking out of the Whole Foods store one Saturday afternoon. As I approached my truck, a couple of bees flew past me. They were followed by ten, twenty, a thousand. Pretty soon the parking lot was alive with this swarm. People were running into stores. Some dove quickly into their cars. We simply were in the path of a natural phenomenon as it passed through the parking lot. I was busy trying to see where they were headed. I was hoping for a landing in one of the small, close-to-the-ground maple trees that dot the lot. No such luck. They gathered at the top of the wall above the AT&T store. I had no time to try to catch them because I was headed to my grandson's birthday party. Sunday morning they were still there. I left my truck sitting in the parking lot with a hive box filled with comb and some honey. There is always a chance that a swarm will choose to move into a well-positioned box. I have caught swarms that way, but not this time. Monday morning I got a call from a friend while I was at work. He was standing with a couple of people who worked for McKinley Properties as they looked up at the swarm. They wanted the bees removed. So my buddy told them about me and they gave me access to the roof of the building. My co-worker, Fred, and I climbed up a ladder with all our stuff, from the second floor through a hatch, out onto the roof. We taped the box that would hold the swarm. Lying on our bellies, we held the box beneath the swarm as it clung to the underside of a small overhang at the top of the wall. I held one side; Freddie held the other while he swept the bees into the box. The swarm probably contained 20,000 bees.

It appeared to be about twice the size of a three-pound package, about 10,000 bees that one purchases from a supplier. It all went pretty well until some of the bees took offense at the brushing part. A bunch of them crawled up Freddie's arm. He was wearing black \u2014 a bad color for working with bees \u2014 and they began to sting. He took off. I scraped a few more bees from the underside of the ledge. It appeared to me that I had the queen in the box, so I taped it shut. I had them. My poor buddy, however, got multiple stings on his arm. He was starting to swell, so I scrambled for my tool bag where I usually have some Benadryl. There was none, so we headed toward Walgreens. On our way back to work, we stopped at the Urgent Care where he was given a steroid shot. The hand and arm were very swollen. By the next afternoon, he was back to normal. I think that he has a bee suit on order. We have caught several swarms together. Usually, we are both in nothing but tee shirts and shorts. The bees tend to be docile and disoriented. They have neither brood nor food to protect. I will continue to wear my jacket and veil. Next time, he will wear protection, too...just in case. The 'girls' are now residing happily in my back yard. There is always a chance that the queen was damaged in this process, and a new queen will need to be found, but at this point, it looks like I have a new hive. Andy, like all the beekeepers I talked with, seems to regard bees as a part of his family. But none of them are as immersed in the daily lives of bees, or rely on them to the degree that Paul Bantle and Annie Elder of the Community Farm of Ann Arbor do. Paul and Annie founded the biodynamic farm 25 years ago. Besides raising a large variety of herbs and vegetables for their nearly two hundred member families, Paul and Annie keep bees and sell their honey, and make healing salves and candles out of their wax. The two of them have long studied, lived, and championed sustainable lifestyles, for humans and the rest of the natural world, and are two of the most respected members of our area's holistic community. (Paul and Annie were featured in our cover story on Community Supported Agriculture in Issue #42, May thru August 2009, of the Crazy Wisdom Journal , available on our website's archive at: http://www.crazywisdom.net/cw-community-journal.html) I talked with Paul on the last of May, an overcast, windy, blustery early evening. We sat in the farm's long, triangular shaped greenhouse, a propane heater between us, surrounded by countless flats filled with cucurbit seedlings, cantaloupe, watermelon, and cucumber, waiting to be planted in the fields when the weather warmed. From the greenhouse we could see the farm's 10 beehives, and our conversation was periodically punctuated by the crowing of a rooster from the nearby chicken coop. Paul has a ruddy, weather beaten face, and when he takes off his ever-present baseball cap, you can see the farmer's tan line on his forehead. He has a direct, open gaze and a ready, hearty laugh. He speaks slowly, with an air of serenity and calmness, but with intensity and passion. He begins by gesturing at the seedlings on the greenhouse shelves and says, \"The bees love the blossoms of all of these, and, of course, the fruits. Bees can multiple pollinate fruits, so they'll return to the blossom over and over again, different bees, and that increases the fertility in that fruit and it can make a fuller, richer fruit by more visits from the bees.\" A local beekeeper named John Ochs had kept hives at the Community Farm for a number of years, but, about 10 years ago, Paul and Annie met Gunther Hauk, a fellow biodynamic farmer and preeminent beekeeper. They invited him to their farm to give an introduction to beekeeping, and eventually they began keeping bees, too. Paul talked enthusiastically and at length about what they've learned about bees and their role on their farm, touching on Rudolf Steiner's insights about the amazing life cycle of bees and the interconnectedness of the whole farm organism. I was particularly struck by Paul's ability to constantly view their bees, and his own interactions with them, from a higher perspective. I was also struck by his humility and willingness to examine his own actions in working with the bees, even when encountering serious adversity in his beekeeping. He began: It's great to have bees as part of your farm organism. A lot of people look at it strictly from the perspective of pollination, so they can have fuller, richer fruits and have more of them because more blossoms get touched and pollinated. And with John, the earlier beekeeper, we recognized an increase in productivity on the farm, but in biodynamic farming, there is a whole other level of interest in the bees, and that has to do with making your farm organism more full. Biodynamic agriculture would really pre-date the word organic even, and both of them have historical roots that go back hundreds of years. The word organ literally refers to the organs of the farm body and that's what makes it organic and whole. So in BD agriculture, when you're searching for a whole organism, you're looking for, what do the cows, as an organ, bring into the being? What can the bees sort of ray in from the cosmos, and mediate with the earthly realm and the humans? And on and on it goes; what role do the chickens have, what role do the humans have? Then you have this sheath around the earth, and out of it emerges this incredible array of plant life that's just covering the earth and is mediating between the heavens and the earth also. (Paul laughs with wonder.) So just trying to start to appreciate the inner connectedness between all these beings, and the unity of life, is wonderful, and, of course, the bees are fantastic. Let's start with the swarm. What happens is that the bee colony, through communication that's very fine \u2014 and we don't really totally understand this \u2014 the queen and the workers communicate Meeting Them Halfway ~Local Beekeepers Combine a Fascinating Hobby with an Altruistic Goal \u2014 Helping Bees Survive and Thrive Continued from page 45 \"As I approached my truck, a couple of bees flew past me.

The queen is laying many, many thousands of eggs in the cells, and at some point when they've decided that they need to swarm, the workers will build special cells that are queen cells. They're peanut shaped cells, different from the cells that a worker or a drone is born out of. Those peanut shaped cells hang from the bottom of a frame, and they'll either put an egg in there or the queen will lay an egg in there. Then they feed it special food and they rear it in that special peanut shaped cell and it ages for 16 days and then it hatches out, and that's a newborn queen. It can either happen that they start to hatch out, or they haven't yet, and the mother queen of that hive exits the hive with about two thirds of the nucleus of bees. A lot of times it's that the hive is becoming quite dense in population; the weather is getting warm, the nectar is flowing, the conditions are good for this body of bees to divide and perpetuate itself. In Steiner's presentation, this is a process of reincarnation. So, it's a necessary process in which the group soul of these bees is being nourished in moving on and perpetuating its life form at the same time. And so the queen will leave. She has to shrink, she can't carry all the weight. She's quite big when she's in the hive and she's laying, but she is able to shrink and lower her weight and then she can fly. She'll exit the hive with two thirds of these bees. Usually they'll land somewhere first, in a cluster, and scouts will go out and look for a new living site. The third of the remaining colony are there to nurture the newborn queen that emerges from those cells \u2014 only one of which will remain viable in the hive. They'll figure out. (Paul smiles.) If more than one of the newborn queens emerge, they'll reconcile who is going to go on with that group. Then she has to do a maiden flight, because she's not fertile. She's born infertile, leaves the hive and goes way, way, way up into the heavens; she's flying towards the sun. And the drones will go after her. I've heard old beekeepers, even local beekeepers, talk about when there'd be so many wild hives around that the drones would come from all over and you could see a cone of drones following this maiden queen. You can imagine the amount of diversity in that breeding process. Nowadays you don't have that. Now your drones are all coming from the hives in your apiary. I've never seen a maiden flight. I've seen many swarms over the years, and have caught many swarms. This year we've caught three swarms already. A lot of times I'll know that a hive is about to swarm; it's imminent, just from paying attention to the hives over the weeks. For one thing, you can see these swarm cells. They're very distinctive and they hang from the bottom of the frames. Also sometimes you get a sense of the temperament of the hive, and then you just try to pay attention in the morning and afternoon, not right at noon so much. It seems like a lot of them will swarm in the morning, around 10, 11 o'clock and then again in the afternoon, 2, 3 o'clock or so. Because we're on the farm here, we'll often hear them. We'll be out in the field and we'll hear them swarm. And then we can catch them. They're pretty easy to catch. After her maiden flight, the new queen goes right back into that same hive. She's been multiply inseminated, fertilized, and she starts laying. That's her only flight, until sometime down the line when she might also swarm. It used to be that these queens could live five, six years \u2014 who knows, way back when \u2014 I'm just talking about modern day lore I hear. They would have enough eggs for five years. These hives can grow to 60,000 bees in the heart of the summer, when the nectar is really flowing. She has to renew that kind of population, on a yearly basis, for five years. And she can lay at a phenomenal rate per day. It's all this intimacy between the workers going out into the environment and sensing what's happening there in terms of availability of nectar and pollen and warmth, and coming home and letting her know, such that she knows, well, now I need to up my laying. Or, now I shouldn't because it's too early in the year and it's cold and I don't have a strong enough population to keep that brood at the warmth it needs to be at, to birth. What we know, I believe, as with so many things, [is that] the unseen is so much more vast. Steiner, he penetrated into so many things. The guy clearly was extraordinary in being able to see into things. I think one thing he clearly saw about the bees, just like he did with agriculture, is our materialistic tendency. We actually brought the bee into being, humans did. We took the fig wasp, I don't even know how far back, and we played with it such that it evolved into what we have now, the modern day bee, just like we've got a cow now that isn't what the cow was then. So we built this relationship we have with these creatures. And in our recent evolution, we've gotten increasingly manipulative and more demanding. In a spiritual sense, of course, we're all trying to overcome our primal tendencies of greed and selfishness and evolve as a creature. And so I'm starting to understand now what Steiner was showing us \u2014 and what all the mystics show us, basically \u2014 that we've got to figure out how to live in balance with these creatures, and give as much or, probably, I think, what it's going to boil down to is, more than we get. We've flipped that equation around, and it's very obvious that since the early 1900s, we've been trying to get way more from these creatures than we give them. A lot of our practices have unfolded to accomplish that end. And I don't mean to imply that people are just outlandishly mean or selfish towards the bees. It's very subtle how it takes over in us. I could even see it in me, in just these 10 years, and I've had to challenge myself and change certain tendencies so that I don't think of the bees in terms of how much honey am I going to end up with, and how much wax am I going to get. I still want honey and I still want wax, but I don't want it at the expense of the bees' overall welfare.

This insight into the swarming \u2014 that it is in a spiritual sense a process of reincarnation \u2014 it becomes imperative that a beekeeper gets a sense of that and supports that activity. It's not even an activity; it's the bees' birthright, to evolve and to reincarnate. So, to develop practices that prevent swarming is going to ultimately lead us into a predicament. But, in fact, in conventional and industrialized beekeeping that's a major practice. And there's a good reason for it, because as soon as a hive swarms, two thirds of those bees leave. They go and establish a whole new home, draw out all their foundation where they store their wares for the winter. They're gone if you don't catch them, and you're left with the third of the bees, and they need to jump start themselves again because it takes 21 days from the time an egg's laid until a worker hatches. So, there's almost a one-month break from when that mother queen leaves until new brood are coming out. That often will happen in May and June when the nectar is flowing. So, it's a total interruption in the acquisition of honey. I remind Paul of a conversation we had in December when he told me that last year was his best ever, but that the previous year was very rough. His face becomes somber as he responds: The year before was tragic, really. You remember me saying earlier that I've had to unlearn certain tendencies in myself. This process of catching these swarms becomes critical to regenerating the overall immune system of the bees and the life of your apiary. That part I was getting well attuned to over a six, seven-year period. I'd been catching many swarms every spring and tracking all the lineages, taking good notes and really paying attention. I had streams of bees that were five years old. This is in a day and age when people get them and they die over winter. I was feeling pretty good about building up some stronger lineages, but then, lo and behold, I got hit by foul brood disorder. There's a European foul brood and an American foul brood and they've been around for decades. When it first arrived in the States it was very devastating to beekeepers. It just ran through the hives. While the queen lays eggs and the nurse bees take care of the eggs, they cap them and the eggs develop into larva in the caps; they never go to full development. They kind of puddle out; they get soupy inside the cells. I had a premonition of it a couple of years before it hit really hard. My error, as I look back on it, was that I wasn't changing out my wax enough. It takes 10 times the trips to the blossom to make wax out of their own bodies as it does to put up honey. So wax, their drawn foundation, to most conventional beekeepers becomes infinitely valuable. It's what bees put their eggs into and [where they] store all the food. If you're giving them bare foundation, or no foundation at all, and they always have to work that up, then [they can't produce honey during that time]... Do you see the difference there? Many beekeepers will swear you want that comb...you keep that comb for 20 years if you can. But really it should be changed out every two to three years, so that they're building more comb. That's an instinctual activity of theirs; it invigorates them as an organism, to build the bones of their body, and makes it nice and fresh and renews it. And also for it to be relatively clean, not to get to that dirtier state. With each passing year, because larvae are developing in there, they leave behind the case that they matured in, and so the comb goes from a real bright beautiful yellow like you see in candles, to darker and darker. It gets dirtier. Well, I know that I was hedging too much on that. I was between two worlds, knowing of the need to be a little cleaner and also knowing that there was this possibility to leave it just a little bit longer. And I think that created an environment that lowered their overall immune system and made them more vulnerable to foul brood. Foul brood is in the environment, and if they're strong, they resist it. The typical conventional approach is more allopathic in nature, and some beekeepers treat on a yearly basis with chemicals for foul brood. They're not eliminating it, but they're repressing it. I know of some hives near here that were infected with foul brood, so if those hives had a high infection rate, the bees do cross over, and so it could have come in from a few different vehicles. But foundationally speaking, I recognized in my own practices a need for improvement and a need to overcome a tendency to want to provide them with too much. So I'm getting into a rhythm of being cleaner and changing better, just like the bedding for the cows. As a consequence of this disease, all but one hive was wiped out, all these lineages that I had caught as swarms, and that had felt real strong to me. It was one of these rainy springs; it just kept raining, so they didn't have the warmth, they didn't have the sun, and they didn't have the nectar flows. Everything was just right for this to occur. The one hive that made it through the winter was one of the hives that swarmed and probably interrupted a cycle of something that was going on, and got invigorated by this process of \"In Steiner's presentation, this is a process of reincarnation... in which the group soul of these bees is being nourished in moving on and perpetuating its life form at the same time....

I have that hive still going. That's a hive from '05, so that's seven years old now, and she's really strong and she's going crazy this year. She's really just hugely populated like I've never seen before. But all the other equipment we had to clean. I had to boil it in a lye bath, in a big vat. We had to take all the wax out of all the frames, more than a thousand frames, and over a hundred boxes, just a phenomenal number of pieces that had to be taken apart and boiled in this lye bath. I rented a propane roofer's torch and torched the insides of the boxes, so that all the propolis that's stored there, and all the wax remnants, would all boil and kill these microorganisms that cause the foul brood. It took us two weeks, and a bunch of people pitched in, and we got it all cleaned up, rendered all the wax, and then last year we got going again. We had to get shipped bees. I didn't know any other way to do it. And they came into this clean, spic and span equipment, and everything about last year's spring and then going into summer and the fall seemed to provide just what they needed. They built these majestic combs, and brought in nectar and pollen. Every hive was strong. I leave a lot of honey in them in the winter. I give them two deep supers and a medium super of honey. What is a super? A super is a rectangular box, and a stack of them makes a hive. The two bottom ones are the brood chambers, so those are the deeper ones. That's where they're laying the babies and nursing them and where they hatch out. That's where the queen spends most of her time. Those upper boxes are where they're putting all their extra honey up. I'll leave one of those on top of the two deep. Because you don't know what a winter is going to be like here and how long into spring before forage comes out. I remind Paul that in an in earlier conversation he'd told me that he no longer uses a protective suit when working with the bees. That's been great. For two years I've been doing that. That was another big shift for me. Gunther doesn't use protective gear, and I saw that, I saw him working with the bees. He's my mentor. I felt I needed it, and he never said a word to me. I don't think anybody should feel \u2014 a person should do what makes them feel comfortable and calm, because the bees know that, they sense that. That was my approach for the first number of years, to use protective gear. But, it does insulate you from them in the sense that you don't have to put up so much with their experience of life while you're in their home. You're in their womb, and you're monkeying around in there. And the gloves are kind of thick and clunky, and you can inadvertently smash bees. And bees \u2014 I've found this now with cows, and I've read it about elephants, and I've seen it with the bees. They tend their dead just like humans do. They go to them and they have feelings about the loss. So, when you inadvertently kill a bee, the other bees get very upset about that. It can agitate the whole hive, and definitely send some number of the bees toward you. So, I've found by not having protective gear, I started to move a lot slower, and I started to pay attention to when it was appropriate to enter their hives, and when they were telling me, 'Hey, you don't belong here.' Because it's overcast, it's not sunny, they're not out gathering, they're all in there. It's denser. If they've lost a queen, if they're not queen right, you can tell right away. There's a calmness about a hive that's settled with their queen. So there's all these circumstances that you start to pay more attention to, and you develop an intimacy and just slow down. I'm way slower, because with all this protective gear you can bump things and that vibration goes through the hive and it agitates them. You can get dumb about it. Not in a bad kind of way, but the nicest expression of what dumb is. We laugh and I suggest the word \"dull.\" Dull, thank you. You get dull. So, whether you use protective gear or not, you need to cultivate the proper mental state about what you're doing with them, a reverence and a respect. Steiner foresaw that we were going to progressively manipulate bees more and more to meet our ends at the expense of their need to live their spiritual impulse on the earth. I know people are paying more and more attention. It matters in that it is opening our consciousness to what is going on that is causing wholesale oppression in the environment, and of our fellow beings, and other humans. Because the bees are so in touch with their forage, they take you into the whole plant world; to follow their rhythms, both their daily rhythms and their seasonal rhythms, in relation to the plant world and the rains and all the changing climate; it's amazing. You end up looking at what flower are they on at this time of the day, during this month, and then next month it's all totally different. In the morning it's these blossoms, and midday it's those blossoms, and all the different colors, and they're out gathering the diversity of pollen, and you start to realize they are touching everything. You can't tell, but they're all over, in all these different plants, but there's also a cloud of them, there's got to be like a sheath of bees above us. We have 10 hives, with 60,000 bees in each; that's 600,000 bees. Not all of them are out at the same time, but they're all going out. There's a form of communication there that's happening that we don't really totally grasp. In other words, we have a lot to learn here if we want to speak this language, if we truly want to be a part of this dialogue. And that's just that one insect. Oh man...(Paul starts laughing) this is way more complex than we're giving it credit. Yeah. ### Meeting Them Halfway ~Local Beekeepers Combine a Fascinating Hobby with an Altruistic Goal \u2014 Helping Bees Survive and Thrive Continued from page 49\"Steiner foresaw that we were going to progressively ma- nipulate bees more and more to meet our ends at the expense of their need to live their spiritual impulse on the earth.

The house sits behind a carefully groomed, semi-circular garden. A curious sign sits over the front door: The Anthroposophical Society. What is this barely pronounceable name? If one is acquainted with Rudolf Steiner, the early 20 th century philosopher, it may help to know that the building is also called the Rudolf Steiner house. His philosophy, \"anthroposophy,\" is named for Anthropos, Greek for human being, and Sophia, wisdom. Altogether, it is \"wisdom of the human being\" or the wisdom that knows what it means to be human. This stands in contrast to theosophy, the study of divine wisdom, a popular movement in his day. Steiner developed his philosophy by lecturing at the Theosophical Society, where he was a leading member until he broke from the group. He founded the Anthroposophical Society in Vienna in 1923. Today there are branches around the world. The house at 1923 Geddes (a numerical coincidence?) in Ann Arbor is the American national headquarters for the Society. It is the site of conferences, art exhibitions, concerts, meetings, lectures, and conclaves. It also serves as a hub of information for the group's activities. Overseeing its programs is Marian Le\u00f3n, Director of Administration and Member Services. Honey-haired, unpretentious, with blue eyes that sparkle, Marian is a former dancer and musician, who earned both her B.A. and M.A. at the University of Michigan School of Music. She played clarinet. She was in the music school's most \u00e9lite orchestras, and upon graduation, was offered a position with the Omaha Symphony. According to her colleagues, Marian's classical music training helps explain her uncanny knack for reaching consensus among the \"passionate and sometimes cantankerous\" members of the Society. Dennis Dietzel, of Minneapolis, describes the Society's membership as \"challenging,\" with \"conflicting interests and personalities.\" He says that Marian is able \"to bring us all together with her wisdom and humor, averting potential catastrophes with warmth and professionalism.\" Other colleagues confirm that assertion. According to Margaret Runyon, of New Orleans, \"Marian's The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2013 Page 52 innate sense of harmony allows her to tune in to individuals and situations to create consonant synergy\"; her \"maternal fortitude\" allows her \"to maintain focus and equanimity, bringing order to whatever degree of chaos might be unfolding around her.\" Ann Arbor's Margot Amrine, whose husband, Professor Frederick Amrine, is an expert on anthoposophy, says simply: \"The Society is blessed to have her!\" The Amrine children played with the Le\u00f3n brood, and Margot sees parallels between Marian's administrative and mothering skills. She says: \"Marian made her children's childhoods imaginative, creative, and fun.\" She adds: \"Marian is one of those very rare people who has vision and can see the big picture, but is very detail-oriented.\" Amrine and her husband are among several who note that many anthroposophists discovered anthroposophy through their children, as Marian did. Waldorf schools, also known as Steiner schools, draw students and families from all walks of life. Marian's six children now range in age from 16-30. When her first-born was ready for preschool, a friend rhapsodized about the Waldorf preschool that her daughter attended. The young mothers shared much, including a midwife, and their children were playmates. Both mothers had read and re-read the book Special Delivery by Rahima Baldwin. Baldwin turned out to be the Waldorf preschool teacher. Yet Marian worried when she learned that the school had a spiritual component. She was, at the time, a serious student of Sufism. Would the Waldorf school's spiritual notions conflict with the spiritual beliefs of her family? She called the teacher to ask. \"Rahima was as interested in Sufism as I was in Waldorf,\" says Marian, \"and a life-long friendship was born.\" Baldwin also became Marian's midwife for her last three pregnancies. Fast forward 16 years, to when Marian's sixth child was ready for preschool. To help pay for this last Waldorf tuition, Marian began working for the Anthroposophical Society, doing data entry for 12 hours a week. Her responsibilities grew, and six years later, in 2006, she became Administrative Director. Marian explains that the Waldorf schools' pedagogical principles involve a partnership between the child, the parent(s), and the teacher. Waldorf education is based on a particular view of child development, and parents agree to try and create a home life that supports this developmental picture. As I learned more about Waldorf's approach to early childhood development, and experienced the benefits it brought to our home life as well as their education, I began to study anthroposophy. The Waldorf philosophy is premised on the conviction that everyone has gifts that can benefit others, and that people learn by doing. Steiner was a strong proponent According to Margaret Runyon, Marian Le\u00f3n's \"maternal fortitude\" allows her \"to maintain focus and equanimity, bringing order to whatever degree of chaos might be unfolding around her.\"The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2013 Page 53 of children's play, which, he said, stimulates curiosity and investigation \u2014 the precursors to scientific inquiry. Likewise, children's bodies must be allowed freedom of movement. Steiner and his wife developed a dance form called \"eurythmy,\" a physical art of flowing movement that combines grace, rhythm, energy, and harmony. Many Waldorf schools encourage this art. Academically, children master a subject by examining it and then writing their own books on it. Teachers \"loop\" with the child; that is, a teacher remains with her class from kindergarten through eighth grade. Steiner believed that the teacher essentially becomes a renaissance person through this process, learning along with students in order to guide them through increasingly complex material. A great deal of learning goes on outdoors, and most Waldorf schools have gardens in which students practice \"biodynamic agriculture,\" another Steiner invention and a precursor to today's eco-friendly initiatives. Students also build structures, negotiate business arrangements, and apply a variety of anthroposophical principles to life and work. Marian explains this and much more as she shows me the building, a handsome landmark 10 minutes' walk from University of Michigan's central campus. The garden blooms from early spring through late fall, with poppies, ferns, peonies, roses, irises, lilies, rhododendron, and a host of other plants. Originally, the house was a fraternity for U-M students, so there is an industrial kitchen in the basement. The second floor has bedrooms on either side of a long, narrow hall. These rooms accommodate guests for symposia and other such gatherings. Overlooking the hall is an expressionistically painted eurythmy dancer in flowing robes. The main floor has offices, a library, and a long, large lecture hall with a grand piano. The room doubles as a concert hall. Along the sides, sculpted arches frame tall, rectangular windows. The front wall has a fireplace, over which hangs a portrait of Rudolf Steiner. In the building's frat days, a moose head was mounted there. Marian points out the sponge-painted walls throughout the house, in variegated shades of blue and peach. Her roomy office has large windows, a long desk, two walls of books, and family photos. One in particular captures my attention. It is a photo of Marian surrounded by her six children. It evokes the storyteller dolls of the Pueblo people. I admire it, and she shows me another photo \u2014 on the cover of another book by her friend, Rahima Baldwin, You Are Your Child's First Teacher. Suddenly self-conscious, she redirects my attention to the glass enclosed model of the Goetheanum, the structure that Steiner designed and built in Dornach, Switzerland (near Basel). Its curvilinear architecture presages Frank Gehry. Created as a cultural center, it hosts lectures, concerts, classes, art exhibitions, and theatrical events, including Steiner's marathon dramas. In 1938, both parts of Goethe's Faust premiered there. The original Goetheanum burnt to the ground in 1922, three years after it was completed. The concrete replacement, also designed by Steiner, is the world headquarters for the movement. Marian tells me that the Anthroposophical Society now has chapters in 83 countries, and schools in 53. Rudolf Steiner's vision included educational, economic, agricultural, financial, medical, and social reforms. The Waldorf schools, which are based on his pedagogical ideas, represent the most well-known elements of his philosophy. The name, Waldorf, comes from the Waldorf-Astoria Cigarette Factory in Stuttgart, where Steiner gave a lecture to the workers. Afterward, the factory owner, Emil Molt, asked Steiner to help create a school for the workers' children. That first Waldorf school opened in 1919. Today, there are more than 900 Waldorf schools and 1,600 early childhood programs on six continents. I try to steer conversation back to Marian, but she prefers to talk of the Society. Our conversation teeters between the personal and philosophical. I remind her of our first encounter 35 years ago, when she worked at WUOM on State Street. She was tall and willowy, with long, flaming red hair, a twinkle in her eye, and a gracious mien. She looked like the dancer she was in those days. She recalls our time together and smiles, relaxing. She begins with talk of her children. She glows with gratitude when speaking of them, marveling at how much they have taught her. All of her children were born at home, and she sometimes seems surprised to find herself the mother of six. She had planned a career in music. Children were not in the picture. Growing up, she was passionate about dance and clarinet. Every Sunday, from age 12, Marian played duets with \"Grandpa Johnson,\" her elderly neighbor who became Marian's surrogate grandfather. Marian's real grandparents died when she was little, and the Johnsons had been close family friends for several generations. They welcomed Marian into their lives. Grandpa Johnson bought Marian her first good clarinet. He also arranged for her to study with Keith Stein, a music faculty member at Michigan State. She traveled there twice a month for three years to study with him. \"It was really exciting to be able to drive myself to East Lansing once I got my driver's license! I would have an early morning clarinet lesson, spend some time on campus, and then drive into Lansing to study ballet with Virginia Simmons. I loved it!\" Marian smiles, contemplating those days. She recalls her childhood in Merrill, Michigan, where she grew up the youngest of four. The town was the hub of her extended family, both paternal and maternal. Some family members are still there. \"As a child, I was surrounded by aunts and uncles, and lots of cousins.\" Marian's father was one of six children, her mother one of three. \"Every Sunday we went to my grandparents' home for a huge Sunday dinner.\" Marian is pleased that her children have equally rich memories of Sunday dinners, here in Ann Arbor, at the home of their paternal grandmother, who also had six children. Marian is a strong believer in karma, as was Steiner, who probed the wisdom of ancient religions, scientific inquiry, intuition, perception, inspiration, imagination \u2014 and paranormal experiences \u2014 to develop his philosophy.Many anthroposophists discovered anthroposophy through their children, as Marian did. Waldorf schools, also known as Steiner schools, draw students and families from all walks of life. [Rudolph Steiner] believed that every human being has something to contribute, and that development of the self contributed to the evolution of the world... These anthroposophical principles are the foundation for the Camphill Movement, tailored to people with special needs. In Camphill communities, people live, learn, and work together in an environment of mutual care and respect. There are now more than 100 Camphill communities in 22 countries. Continued on page 54The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2013 Page 54 Marian's father was born in Belgium, to Flemish-speaking parents. During the Second World War, when he was six years old, the family moved to Michigan's Saginaw Valley. They had difficulty learning English, and life was hard. He left school after eighth grade. Marian's mother, an aspiring writer, planned to go to college. Reminiscing about her mother, Marian says: She received a scholarship to attend a small college to study English and writing \u2014 quite unheard of in her day! She declined the opportunity in order to stay home and nurse her mother, who was dying of cancer.... My mother was quite impressive.... She was the librarian for the local library. This started as a very part-time job, and she developed it into a well respected institution. My mother was instrumental in creating the White Pine District \u2014 one of the first district libraries in the state. She realized that all of the little village libraries were duplicating efforts, and wouldn't it be better for everyone \u2014 especially the school children \u2014 if they could share their collections.... It was a very big deal at the time. The apple didn't fall far from the tree. Asked what life was like with six children, Marian says: If you were to speak with my children, they would tell you that at times it was crazy! But it was worth it. As young adults, they are very close, and I like to think that because they lived in such close quarters growing up, they have a sense of patience and respect for the people they interact with in their lives.... We had family dinners every night, and it wasn't until I was at a teacher's conference with my fourth child that I realized this was something unusual. The teacher asked if we ate dinner together. When I replied yes, she said she could tell because my child was able to listen to his classmates and converse with them in a way that was becoming uncommon. Imagine, something as simple as having dinner together could influence one's social interactions! Of course, this was not always simple when we had to balance high school schedules with the needs of younger children. When everyone was still living at home, we had piano lessons, guitar lessons, two girls in dance, drum lessons, paper route, lacrosse, boy choir, youth chorale \u2014 and school for six kids! Oh, don't forget soccer. Sara [the youngest] did not get to study an instrument, which she still regrets! I couldn't take on another thing at the time. Time is an interesting phenomenon. I can remember, especially with babies, that some days lasted forever. And yet, as I reflect back, the whole period of intense parenting went by in a flash. Some days were hard, but more often they were very fulfilling. People who work with Marian hold her in high esteem. San Francisco based John Beck, the Society's Director of Communications and Editor of Being Human , says, \"I couldn't do my job without Marian's overall guidance, good organization, and good will.\" Professor Frederick Amrine, who greatly admires Marian, describes her as \"a spiritual seeker.\" Marian's interest in Sufism, which included study with a Sufi shaykh, lasted for 20 years. Sufism is a mystical branch of Islam, dealing with metaphysics and the idea of unity with God. When Marian encountered Steiner's ideas, she discovered that his vision complemented the Sufi vision she had studied. As she puts it: \"I was drawn to Steiner's emphasis on manifesting one's inner work in one's practical work in the world. One doesn't 'work on oneself' only for oneself, but for the betterment of the whole human condition \u2014 social forms, earth healing, etc.\"Marian is a strong believer in karma, as was Steiner, who probed the wisdom of Rudolf Steiner's Vision in Practice in Ann Arbor Continued from page 53 When Marian encountered Steiner's ideas, she discovered that his vision complemented the Sufi vision she had studied.

When Steiner was nine, he had a vision that his aunt was calling to him for help. She had just died, though no one yet knew. Marian has similar stories. She has had the profound sense that she recognized people upon first meeting them, as though she knew them in a former life. The story of Marian's last childbirth experience is also a bit surreal. She was at home, cooking dinner for her children, when the doorbell rang. It was an unexpected visitor: her midwife. \"I was in a meeting,\" the midwife said, \"and had a flash that you needed me, so I came. Are you okay?\" Marian laughed, said something about Braxton-Hicks (false labor contractions), and invited her in for tea. As Marian stood at the stove, the midwife suddenly said: \"You just had another contraction. I saw it. Come with me to the bedroom; let's check this out.\" Marian was eight centimeters dilated. The baby was born within the hour. Marian's eyes twinkle with amusement. \"If the midwife hadn't come that day, I don't know what I'd have done. It was just me and the little ones at home.\"I mention the famous quotation from Hamlet: \"There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, than are dreamt of in your philosophy.\" Marian nods and chuckles. She offers another story. During a family trip from Ann Arbor to Fenton, with all six kids piled in the van, the old vehicle lost power. They stayed on the highway, chugging along at 30 m.p.h., until finally, the van gave out \u2014 in their friends' driveway! Contemplating her personal journey, she says: In the 70's women were finding their identities beyond the scope of wife and mother. And here I was, doing just the opposite. I remember freaking out one day when my eldest was three months old, when I realized that I would be a mother forever ! What does it mean to be a mother? What kind of mother did I want to be? Who are these children who have come into my life? I found myself in this strange role of wife and mother, completely supported by a husband, and I needed to find a way to make sense of this. I came to the decision that motherhood would be my path of self-development. Children are mirrors, especially young children. They are excellent at reflecting ourselves back at us, if we are willing to look! I think by choosing motherhood as my \"path,\" it gave me permission to learn how to become a parent. It taught me that I wasn't doing this alone; there are spiritual guides along the way. And it gave me a long perspective. Motherhood is my spiritual path. Marian felt the stigma of her choice to stay home and raise children. While \"stay-at-home moms\" were now said to \"work in the home,\" the linguistic sleights of hand carried little weight. The new vocabulary felt pejorative \u2014 even though Marian worked outside the home, however part-time. She helped her friend, Rahima, organize conferences on Waldorf education. The first was a parenting conference called \"Magical Years.\" (The name evokes Selma Freiberg's The Magic Years\u00b8 written in the 70's. It was a popular, ground-breaking, and influential book on early childhood development.) A second conference was on homeschooling based on Waldorf methods. When Rahima moved away, Marian convinced the Anthroposophical Society to continue the conferences. Thus was born the \"Creative Human Spirit\" series, which lasted until 2000 \u2014 when Marian began work at the Society. Marian speaks knowledgeably and readily about Steiner's work. She notes that more than a century ago, he warned that humankind was depleting the earth's resources. Many of his initiatives, including community supported agriculture (CSA) and women's suffrage, which he promoted in 1895, were ahead of their time. He believed that every human being has something to contribute, and that development of the self contributed to the evolution of the world. For him, the words \"creature,\" \"creation,\" and \"creator\" were related in more than linguistic ways. Steiner believed that God gave humankind the wisdom to continue the work of creation. (In German, the root for all three words is sch\u00f6pf). As a philosopher, he dealt in triads: soul, spirit, body; creation, history, salvation; Libert\u00e9, Egalit\u00e9, Fraternit\u00e9. By distilling the French Revolution's notion of fraternit\u00e9 through Karl Marx, Steiner combined brotherhood with altruism in the communal arrangements he promoted. Marian hands me copies of the first two issues of Being Human , a quarterly publication launched last year by the Society. It features articles, book reviews, profiles, and calendar listings. For the first issue, the Society commissioned \"Time is an interesting phenomenon. I can remember, especially with babies, that some days lasted forever. And yet, as I reflect back, the whole period of intense parenting went by in a flash. Some days were hard, but more often they were very fulfilling.\" - Marian Le\u00f3n Continued on page 56 The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2013 Page 56 Professor Frederick Amrine to write an overview of Steiner's philosophy. It is lucid and scholarly. Amrine notes that Steiner was an educator, artist, philosopher, public intellectual, theologian, historian, cultural critic, and spiritual teacher, but \"none of these labels begins to capture the scope and spirit of his work.\" Like most anthroposophists, Amrine deems Steiner a seminal thinker. But Amrine is well aware that such hyperbole elicits skepticism. \"If Rudolf Steiner was really such a genius,\" Amrine asks, pre-empting the skeptics, \"how can he remain widely unknown nearly a century after his death?\" Amrine answers: It has happened before. Aristotle was lost to the West for a millennium. The Catholic Church placed Thomas Aquinas on its Index of proscribed writings. By the early nineteenth century, J. S. Bach's greatness needed to be rediscovered. Van Gogh sold one painting during his lifetime. In retrospect, we wonder how such neglect can have happened. Yet it did. And in the same way, future generations will wonder at us.Amrine is well versed in Steiner's work. He can trace Steiner's vision from the early days, when he called his philosophy a \"spiritual science,\" to later applications of his ideas. It is notable that Steiner's writings fill 400 volumes. It is also noteworthy that Steiner's academic training was broad. In 1879, when he was 18, Steiner enrolled at the Vienna Institute of Technology, where he studied mathematics, physics, chemistry, botany, biology, literature, and philosophy. At age 21, he was named Natural Science Editor of the new edition-in-progress of Goethe's works. The task took six years. For Steiner, the project was transformative. Goethe is best Rudolf Steiner's Vision in Practice in Ann Arbor Continued from page 55 \"I came to the decision that motherhood would be my path of self-development. Children are mirrors, especially young children. They are excellent at reflecting ourselves back at us, if we are willing to look!\" - Marian Le\u00f3nThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2013 Page 57 remembered today for his literary achievements, most notably The Sorrows of Young Werther (1775), a novel, and Faust (1806), a play. But in his day, Goethe was revered for his several, simultaneous careers as poet, philosopher, scientist, politician, and artist. He was known for his wit, and many of his epigrams became household phrases. Among them: Correction does much, but encouragement does more. A useless life is an early death. Age merely shows what children we remain. As soon as you trust yourself, you will know how to live. Common sense is the genius of humanity. Goethe's belief that one learns by doing was a yeasty infusion to Steiner's developing vision. It complemented Steiner's notion that every human being has gifts to share. These anthroposophical principles are the foundation for the Camphill Movement, tailored to people with special needs. In Camphill communities, people live, learn, and work together in an environment of mutual care and respect. There are now more than 100 Camphill communities in 22 countries. It is an ingenious, practical, and humanitarian application of Steiner's wide-ranging ideas, which continue to benefit people around the globe. For Marian Le\u00f3n's children, the Steiner school may seem like ancient history. But for Marian, their early schooling became, in many respects, her education for life. After 36 years of marriage, she recently weathered the challenge of divorce. When I ask her how she's doing, she smiles sadly and says: \"Bad things happen in the best possible ways.\" I'm puzzled by this mantra and ask about it. Marian herself coined it. She explains it by reminding me of the story of her family's drive to Fenton in the van that broke down after they reached their destination. \"Everyone was safe and sound,\" she points out. \"Our friends ended up driving us back to Ann Arbor, so it all ended well. The van still needed to be dealt with, but cars always need to be dealt with.\" I ask whether anthroposophy has helped during this difficult period. \"Absolutely,\" she says. There are spiritual elements in our lives that we can't fully understand. I believe that things happen for a reason. As long as I have faith in that logic, I can move forward. I believe in karma. That doesn't mean that things will always be good; just that they are meant to be. Weeks have passed since my first visit to the Anthroposophical Society headquarters, where Marian guided me with such intelligent warmth. By now, I have read enough to recognize that Marian Le\u00f3n's initial introduction to anthroposophy was extraordinarily comprehensive. I marvel at the scope of material one must ponder before one begins to grasp the whole of Steiner's philosophy. Marian confesses that \"it was a bit overwhelming\"; that there was so much to read when she first arrived on staff. But her education began with her children. She ruminates on the subject of time. \"Over the years,\" she says, \"I gained a respectful appreciation for this immense worldview that is encompassed within the vision of Rudolf Steiner.\" I compliment her on her achievements. She blushes. \"I'm just a mother!\" she says, with the self-effacing modesty that belies her talents. Her humility is a theme reiterated by those who know her. Dennis Dietzel notes that it is \"typical of Marian to deflect the topic from herself.\" He adds that she plays a key role in the central office. Margaret Runyon speaks of Marian's \"selflessness and invisibility,\" adding that Marian's great gift is to be able to create an inviting space in which others may meet and work intentionally together. \"She is awesome!\" From Fair Oaks, California, Leslie Loy writes of her profound respect for Marian, who is Loy's inspiration. \"In my eyes, what makes Marian remarkable is that she leads without pretension, with little regard for the title, but with the sense of what is right, what is needed. She works collaboratively. She listens.\" The Anthroposophical Society is in a period of transition. According to Marian, an effort is being made to have the various branches of anthroposophy collaborate with one another, rather than remain loosely associated under the philosophy's umbrella. By all accounts, with Marian at the helm, the movement is in good hands. For more information about the Anthroposophical Society, visit www.anthroposophy. org.

For this installment of All Creatures Great and Small , she spoke to us about her efforts on behalf of animal welfare and how you can get involved. Q. Patti, you run an animal welfare organization that cares for hospice and medically- challenged pets. Do you care for these animals in your home, by yourself? Where do these animals come from? A. Caring for hospice and medically-challenged pets is only one small portion of what we do. Our board members tend to have sympathy for the animals that are often overlooked, which include animals with medical issues, behavioral issues, and seniors, so those are the animals we sometimes target. Our board members and fosters each specialize in something a little different. I have a soft spot for terminally-ill animals, those with unusual chronic medical conditions, and seniors. Our Vice Chairman, Julia Funds, has a soft spot for cats that are seniors, special needs, and particularly those that are shy or semi-feral. We have an amazing team of integrative vets and vet techs, led by board member Dr. Lucretia Greear, that helps us care for the animals. While we each do all of the in-home care on our own, we take the animals into the vet as needed, based on their condition and/or treatment. We are also friends with many of the vets and vet techs, so help is only a phone call or text away, even in the late hours and on the weekends \u2014 they are wonderful at answering our questions and concerns when an issue pops up unexpectedly. The animals come from all different sources. Some animals come from shelters, some are given to us by our vets, and a few come from other rescue groups. We occasionally take animals directly from owners, but we prefer to work with the owners and help them get the resources they need so they can keep their pets. Q. How many pets have you helped so far?A. We help pets in a variety of ways, so it's difficult to keep exact counts. On the rescue side, we have maybe half a dozen foster homes, though not all are active at once. As for the hospice animals at my home, I have had eight in the last two years, which doesn't include my personal pets that had medical issues and became hospice patients. In addition to rescue, we run a pet food bank and low-cost vaccine clinic. We do our best to help people keep their pets and these are two of the services we offer to work toward that goal. Q. What drew you into working with hospice and medically-challenged animals?A. My first dog, Basil, passed away from cancer unexpectedly at age seven, followed by his brother Sebastian at age nine. Unfortunately, the type of cancer was undetectable until the last day of Basil's life. Even though we couldn't confirm Sebastian had the same cancer, I took preventative measures in an attempt to help avoid the same situation. Considering I also suffer from some chronic conditions, it was a combination of my experience with the dogs and my empathy toward others suffering from unique conditions that led me to work with medically-challenged animals. My first experience with hospice came unexpectedly. I adopted a senior Great Dane/ Mastiff mix and found out he had bone cancer when I first got him. I was told he had two weeks to live. Instead of returning him to the rescue, I chose to fight for him; I named him Haldor. I tried all sorts of treatments from conventional to holistic to very non-traditional. As long as he had a good quality of life and we could control the pain, I continued fighting. Sadly, there did come a day when we could no longer control his pain and it was time to let go. I was glad I was able to provide him with a loving home for the last five months of his life. Q. It sounds like the extent of the treatment you chose for Haldor was significant considering his advanced diagnosis. Since the animals in Basil's Buddies have a hospice diagnosis, is their care less focused on healing to prolong life and more focused on helping animals to be happy, comfortable, and pain-free? A. When we use the term hospice it's not equivalent to human hospice. We consider hospice care to be for animals that have terminal medical conditions. They could be with us for a few weeks or even a few years. We focus on quality of life, which means that the animal is in a loving environment where it can be happy and pain-free for the rest of its days. Depending on the disease and the age and condition of the animal, we may actually choose treatments to help prolong life if it is determined that's in the animal's best interest. In other situations, we may just provide supportive care. All of our animals are treated with an integrative approach to address their physical, mental, and emotional needs. Q. You are a Reiki practitioner. Do you administer Reiki to the animals that live with you and have you seen it make a difference? A. Yes, I use Reiki on the animals in my home, as well as on the animals in our other foster homes as needed. Reiki is just one holistic tool of many that we use to help relieve stress and provide supportive care. We always use Reiki during end of life to help with the animal's transition. In fact, one of my cats, that has since passed, helped in this process, too. We called him the Reiki cat. He would come and lay down next to the animal that was dying and would assist them in their transition by giving them calming energy. Q. How can our readers who are pet owners differentiate between normal signs of aging and chronic conditions? What are some of the indicators? A. Animals age differently than people and they are also more stoic than people, so by the time they start to show signs of pain, the condition is usually pretty well advanced. The best advice I can give to readers is to know their animals, in particular their habits and behaviors. Whenever you see changes in your animal's habits and behaviors, it's best to get it checked out by a vet. It's easier to treat a minor problem before it becomes major. Like they say, it's better to be safe than sorry! Q. How can people support Basil's Buddies or get involved? A. We always have new projects on the horizon and gladly accept both volunteers and donations. People can go to our website at www.BasilsBuddies.org or find us on Facebook. You can check out our adoptable pets, find out what volunteer opportunities we have available, and can donate online, too.

One hurried morning, standing on the porch with my first- and fourth-grade sons and hearing that familiar engine rumbling up the hill, I implored them to run ahead and \"try to make the bus!\" My fourth grader took off like a shot \u2014 fortunately, looking both ways at the street \u2014 and hauled butt in time to take his seat. My other son didn't move. Even back then, my younger son's reaction was typical for him. More often than I would have liked, he would shy away from unfamiliar or challenging situations, avoid taking initiative, or give up easily. And this concerned me because, like most parents, I knew that being able to rise to a challenge was an important life skill for reaping the rewards that only come through effort and persistence. Some kids are luckier in this way. They have positive, strength-based thoughts, planning skills, and the right amount of stress hormone to drive them into responsive action. This combination leads to more openness to trying things, which leads to more practice, which leads to more skill, and so on and so on. Fortunately, there are ways to help a child become more of a self-starter and a self- finisher. But it helps to have a nuanced approach; one that includes understanding, reasonable expectations, both direct support and restraint, acknowledgment of successes, and a realistic perspective. Let's start with perspective. Sometimes what parents believe should be easy for a child is actually a challenge. Additionally, what parents might consider merely challenging can push a child to \"a state of overwhelm.\" A state of overwhelm is when the ability to plan actions, make decisions or process thoughts and emotions shuts down. Time pressure, mental or physical challenges, performance anxiety, and relationship dynamics can all contribute to this state. Add factors like hunger or fatigue, disruptions in routine, academic demands, social anxiety or a difficult temperamental style and - you begin to get the idea \u2014 too much stress causes overwhelm. In the case of my younger son, regardless of what I thought he should have been able to handle, his reaction showed otherwise. If your child shuts down, melts down, acts out, or becomes overly silly, he or she is trying to tell you something. Being attuned to this state is critical, because no thoughtful learning happens here. In fact, the only productive action to take at these times is to immediately shift to strategies that help your child get beyond this negative state in a healthy way, hopefully with your relationship intact. Taking slow, deep breaths, keeping a sense of humor, and, with any luck, having the time to drive your child to school can all help. This may be your growth edge as a parent, so practicing your own resiliency is a great way to model it for your children. The bus is gone. Expressing shame or excessive frustration will not make it come back, and will only serve to complicate your child's ability to rise to the next challenge. Remembering that teaching your children is a long-term endeavor may help with your perspective. Staying out of \"a state of overwhelm\" is Goal 1 for child and parent alike. Goal 2 is giving just the right kind of support to children for them to become comfortable being uncomfortable: having stress, feeling awkward, or being challenged \u2014 and staying engaged anyway. Heidi Grant-Halvorson, author of Succeed: How We Can Reach Our Goals (2011), has encouraging words to say about your child's chances of rising to those challenges. She writes that data shows \"that reaching goals and mastering skills is about strategy, effort, and persistence, and that these things are learned.\" Just remember that each of these is a different \"muscle\" to be strengthened, and each needs a different approach. Spend time being a detective with your child. The key is to break down the breakdown without breaking your child. Because, while slicing tasks into manageable pieces is brilliant for figuring out what skills need to be enhanced, building your child's willingness to put in effort and persistence to enhance these skills is essential. You can do this by noticing all the areas in which your child is already rising to a challenge. When I work with parents, often there is a perception that their child has zero skill at persistence or resiliency. But with a bit of exploration, we always find strengths. (Sometimes it is in areas parents aren't so keen on, but they are there.) Letting go of what you think should be hard for children and focusing more on their true growth edge is essential. In fact, one tip is to slightly play up the potential difficulty of a task. This way children are prepared for the effort, less discouraged by the challenge, and more appreciative of any success. You can notice and acknowledge when your child is coping with being in a store longer than he or she may have wanted to be. You can notice and acknowledge when your child bounces back from changes in a plan. Notice and acknowledge an improvement in a skill because of the effort your child put in. And by all means, admire any areas of self-initiative. Language that notices direction over perfection and effort over accomplishment is much more helpful to building those life-skills muscles. Researcher Carol Dweck calls this \"growth mindset parenting.\" Acknowledging and valuing children's moments of curiosity, resiliency, patience, delayed gratification, grit, and gratitude all contribute to building these strengths. Motivations for initiative are usually connected to one of three drives: autonomy, mastery, and purpose; which, according to best-selling author Dan Pink, will inspire the best outcomes. Talk to your child at calmer moments about why rising to challenges is a good thing. What do you get from it? What do you lose by not trying? Point out the trait of persistence in characters in books, stories, and movies, as well as in real life. Finally, hold children accountable to their potential. They will only learn to build those muscles if they exercise. Don't let them get away with acting like they are incapable when they are capable. Have faith in their ability to learn, and let them know that you expect them to rise to reasonable challenges. Fortunately, these strategies can help. My son's confidence and self-initiative are more evident. Most importantly, he is making more choices, not out of fear but from thoughtfulness and a desire for self-challenge. He doesn't make every bus; but that's okay with me. Because at this point, there are only so many more rides I can give him \u2014 and frankly, I am not in such a rush to see him go.

The deadline for submissions for the September through December issue is June 30, 2013. By Nieka Apell Arts in Motion Since 2001, Ann Arbor's Arts in Motion Dance Studio has offered high-quality dance training with an emphasis on \"self-expression, musicality, and artistic integrity,\" according to Director Amanda Stanger-Read. More than 15 instructors \u2014 most of them college-trained dancers \u2014 lead courses for dancers who range from toddlers to adults in genres ranging from modern dance, ballet, jazz, and tap to Irish dance and private lessons for wedding dances. In April, the studio moved to a new location at 6175 Jackson Road, to be in a 4800-square-foot space shared with the Wild Swan Theater. Stanger-Read explained that the reasons for leaving the space Arts in Motion occupied on Boardwalk since 2001 are twofold. \"Since 2008 and the economic challenges in this area, we haven't seen the number of new students needed to maintain a space of that size independently. Our lease here was up and we decided it was time to find a more sustainable space. We are also so excited about the collaborative programming to be done with the Wild Swan Theater,\" said Stanger-Read. She explained that they are planning two collaborative musical theater camps for this summer. \"We're interested in trying some new things. It's a new market, and we're excited to see what we can offer.\" Stanger-Read added that one of her own first jobs was to dance The Firebird with the Wild Swan Theater. \"We have a long history together,\" she said. \"I've had a connection with them for over 20 years.\" Although Arts in Motion has relocated, Stanger-Read said that the two studios in the new space allow them to maintain their current program of dance offerings. Stanger-Read and her husband, co-owner Scott Read, have spent the past decade developing quality dance curricula for all ages. Stanger-Read began her own dance career in modern dance at age 11 at a small studio in Red Bank, New Jersey, that mixed children and adults in classes. That studio also hosted a regional dance company, and Stanger-Read later had the opportunity to apprentice with the company, doing choreography and seeing the process of touring with the company. She continued her study of modern dance and musical theater in high school, and later at Columbia University in New York. \"I started in musical theater in college \u2014 I also sing \u2014 but I soon felt that every musical just felt similar, repetitive,\" said Stanger-Read, who found herself drawn to modern dance classes at nearby Barnard College. After earning a minor in dance, Stanger-Read came to the University of Michigan, where she completed an MFA in dance. \"The program here is modern-dance based, and that MFA has an emphasis on the historical and cultural aspects of modern dance. It's an intellectual approach to dance,\" said Stanger-Read. It was during her time at the University of Michigan that Stanger-Read began teaching for the University, the YMCA, the Jewish Community Center, and other places. \"I discovered that I loved teaching,\" she said. \"I really like seeing that moment when a student 'gets' it.\" Stanger-Read said that, after marrying and having children, she and her husband \u2014 a ballroom dancer \u2014 realized that the idea of traveling with a dance company was not appealing. They sought a space of their own so that they could teach without needing to travel to multiple locations. \"It was important to us to have a location with easy parking and a comfortable, safe atmosphere so that parents with crawling babies could stay and relax while older children take classes. We have that same environment in our new setting, too. That continues to be important to us,\" said Stanger-Read. In 2001, Stanger-Read opened Arts in Motion and began developing the curriculum she uses today. \"We offer a series of three classes for smaller children, starting with Mommy and Me classes for ages one to three,\" she said. She explained that these classes focus on gross-motor movement, free play, and what it means to have a teacher, to develop listening skills, to take turns, and to follow very simple directions. \"Then all of a sudden, you see this moment that they are ready to be independent,\" she said. \"They push mom away and say, 'I'm ready to do this and to dance without you here with me!'\" The next step, for children aged three to five, incorporates stories and picture books. Stanger-Read also has a degree in English and recognizes the importance of narratives and stories in creating dances. \"I use books with dancing themes, books about movement, and books that have emotional content related to dance and one's body,\" she explained. This class is called Dance Stories and includes elements of pre-ballet and other dance genres. The next step in the basic curriculum is Beginning Dance, and includes an introduction to ballet, modern dance, jazz, and tap. \"The process of creating the dances involves a lot of improvisation and input from the kids themselves. Rarely is there a line of kids all doing the same thing at the same time. We try to focus on the creative process.\" \u2014 Amanda Stanger-Read Stanger-Read and her husband, co-owner Scott Read, have spent the past decade developing quality dance curricula for all ages. \"It is not about competition, or doing the perfect tendu, or even having a flawless recital performance; the emphasis is on expressing your truest self through the medium of dance and having fun while at the same time.\" \u2014 (Parent) Alison DenommeThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2013 Page 63 While some children start at Arts in Motion at a young age, others come later, and Stanger-Read said her studio is very open to that. \"It's really important to me that kids are grouped with kids of similar ages,\" she explained. \"If a twelve-year-old comes to me wanting to dance, I wouldn't make them start from the beginning with the seven-year-olds. They need to know that they must be ready to work hard, but it's not appropriate to put them in with the younger children. My teachers are really good at adapting the curriculum to meet the needs of the older kids who might just now be ready to start dance. This may come from me \u2014 I started dance late myself, and I know that it can feel hard to try to catch up!\" Arts in Motion offers a wide range of classes and experiences for the older and more experienced dancer as well. \"Our studio is well-staffed to develop more serious dancers,\" said Stanger-Read, who said she has a group of high-school ballet students who study between two and four times per week, as well as middle- and high-school jazz and tap dancers. For dancers aged nine to adult, Arts in Motion also offers a student dance company. \"I learned so much from my time with a dance company when I was young,\" Stanger-Read said. \"I knew that this was something I need to offer my students, too. Students do not need to audition to be part of this company. I want this to be open to everyone. You just have to want to be there and to work hard.\" The company meets weekly and includes dancers of all disciplines who come together to work on modern dance choreography. The structure of the company allows for both mentoring and learning opportunities. \"The older, more experienced dancers work together with younger, less experienced dancers. It's beneficial for everyone,\" said Stanger-Read. \"The process of creating the dances involves a lot of improvisation and input from the kids themselves. Rarely is there a line of kids all doing the same thing at the same time. We try to focus on the creative process. For our recitals, too, we try to focus on the process of creating rather than on having everyone doing the same movements at the same time.\" Parent Alison Denomme, whose children Willow and Griffin are both students at Arts in Motion, said she could not be more pleased with the teachers and the philosophy at Stanger-Read's studio. \"I love Arts in Motion because Amanda and her teachers encourage the students to be the best possible versions of themselves they can be. It is not about competition, or doing the perfect tendu, or even having a flawless recital performance; the emphasis is on expressing your truest self through the medium of dance and having fun while at the same time,\" she explained. \"I love how they gradually build students' dance skill and vocabulary and give them the opportunity to experience multiple forms of dance in one class. I love that they have unique offerings like a class that combines visual art and dance.\" She also noted the instructors' ability to meet the needs of children with very different personalities. \"They have supported both my kids equally well; Willow, who is very \"teachable\" and does whatever you tell her, and Griffin, who needs extra attention and support,\" she said. \"Both were welcomed and supported and guided to be and do their best.\" The studio also continues to offer dance exercise classes for adults. Stanger-Read said that these classes have elements similar to the popular Zumba, in addition to drawing on modern dance and Latin dance and Pilates, along with stretching and strength training. \"For a teacher, it can be uninspiring to teach the same movements over and over,\" explained Stanger-Read. \"Our dance exercise classes are small enough that teachers can be creative and focus on the individual students. If someone comes in and says that their back is bothering them, we can work around that for that student. We approach it from the perspective of what our individual students need.\" Stanger-Read said that the instructors use a similar approach for teaching ballroom dance for couples. She said that, while some studios may teach a couple one specific dance, her instructors prefer to teach the communication and hand-leading patterns that can be used in different ways. \"We teach basic patterns and the communication needed to dance together, but not the rote memorization of a series of steps that can feel really repetitive and can be easily forgotten in the stress of a moment like a wedding dance. Our methods leave dancers free to interpret and communicate.\" Stanger-Read said that she appreciates concerns about the expense of dance classes and that, to minimize the stress on families, she strives to keep costs as reasonable as possible. She maintains a \"swap box\" of dance shoes to help with the challenge of ever-growing feet and a rack of gently-used dance clothing that is sold for low prices. In addition, she orders dance clothing through the studio from a company that offers discounts, and she doesn't require specific colors or exact types of leotards and dancewear for her younger students. \"Some little kids dislike pink, others are sensitive to certain types of clothing. Kids just need to come to class neat and in clothing that allows them to feel free to move,\" she said, adding that at higher levels, dancers do need some more specific pieces and colors. Summer camp and course offerings, including the special four-week course that leads up to performances at the Ann Arbor Art Fair, are posted on the studio's website.

For example, a Fly! parent with experience in management helped Whitehouse develop a much-needed strategic plan for the organization. Fly! has also received funding and other support from Eastern Michigan University, the Non-Profit Leadership Alliance, and the New Center. The personal sacrifice and community investment have paid off, according to Whitehouse. In January, Fly! welcomed a new Executive Director \u2014 Chris Blunden, a Michigan native and graphic designer. Blunden founded Living Arts in Detroit and ran that organization for more than 12 years. Living Arts provides an after-school art program and other creativity-enhancing opportunities that are financially accessible to all. While Whitehouse will continue to coordinate the mobile studio and in-house classes, Blunden will focus more on community events and fundraising. Fly! recently held its \"Color the Community\" art contest, an opportunity for kids aged 6 to 12 to create a piece of original artwork representing \"either something fabulous about our community or something that might be lacking in the community that they would love to see,\" said Blunden. Fly! also held a \"micro-campaign\" in April to raise money to support new programming: Blunden said Fly! asked supporters to skip a restaurant lunch for one day and to donate that $10 to Fly! Participants were then encouraged to photograph the lunch they \"created\" for themselves and to send that photo to Fly! \"We hope that this kind of micro-campaign will start small and will grow in the future,\" said Blunden. \"Maybe next year we can host some onsite playing with food and have people send us fun photos of playing with and creating with food.\" Blunden also plans to have Fly! coordinate a photography contest that would be open to children and adults connected with the popular Color Run 5-kilometer race on May 11 in Ypsilanti. Blunden said he hopes to expand the programs offered by Fly! and to continue to serve the mission of bringing art and creativity to children, citing a recent study that showed that American children lose a great deal of their creative aptitude around fourth grade. \"In a study of the creativity index, it showed third graders as still at the level of creative, artistic genius. Then suddenly, around fourth grade, it plummets. Somehow, we are teaching kids not to be creative anymore. From my perspective, the work we do is aimed at solving that problem. We are teaching kids the process of using creativity to solve problems. We want to show how art is meaningful and part of a much bigger skill set that children need in their lives.\"The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2013 Page 64 Fly! Children's Art Center As budget cuts to public school art classes loom heavy in Michigan, a not-for-profit organization in Ypsilanti is dedicated to making sure that children in under-resourced schools have the opportunity to try their hand at the visual arts. Fly! Children's Art Studio converts public schools, libraries, and community centers into temporary art studios for children by bringing in materials, teachers, and volunteers. In addition, Fly! holds drop-in and longer-term studio classes and summer camps for children at their Ypsilanti studio, as well as courses at the Ann Arbor Whole Foods classrooms. Fly! currently holds after-school art programs in all Ypsilanti elementary schools, at Ypsilanti Middle School, and at schools in Wayne, Westland, Romulus, Inkster, and other surrounding communities. These classes are all free to the children enrolled, according to Katie Whitehouse, program director for Fly! Whitehouse said that approximately 65 percent of the children enrolled in the mobile studio school programs participate in the public schools' free lunch program and that the schools supported by the program may have limited funding for art classes. \"There was really a need for this in the community,\" said Whitehouse. \"Fortunately, people saw that!\" What Fly! brings into the schools is different from a typical art class curriculum, explained Whitehouse, since the Fly! teachers do not aim to teach to a test, nor do they feel compelled to have every child produce a similar piece of artwork to hang on the schools' walls. \"We bring in a buffet of art materials and then let the kids decide their own artistic destinies,\" she said. \"A lot of these kids don't have a lot of control in their own lives. It's really important to give them control over their own artistic process.\" Whitehouse noted that this is challenging for kids who are accustomed to art projects that require them to create a specific product. \"Inevitably, the first question I get from many of the kids is, 'So, what am I supposed to make?'\" Whitehouse said that Fly! instructors tell the kids that they can make whatever they would like, and then they talk with the kids about what they might like to try creating. The after-school programs run by Fly! are limited to 15 children per site, so the children get a lot of personal attention. \"We keep the student/teacher ratio low so that there's lots of one-on-one interaction between teachers and kids,\" explained Whitehouse. \"In order to support kids' critical thinking skills and problem-solving, they need this kind of support and encouragement.\" Parents interested in enrolling their children in the Fly! after-school programs apply through their schools, and the students for each term are chosen by school personnel using a lottery system. Each school runs three sessions per year, which means that 45 children at each site receive this art education. This lottery system means that the kids often do not know each other well at the beginning of the session. \"They are encouraged to talk with the kids they don't know, to collaborate. We want them to meet their neighbors and to get their advice, to share their ideas,\" said Whitehouse, adding that many of the kids \"express relief that this isn't just another traditional classroom where they need to be quiet.\" The Fly! mobile art studio began in 2009 as the brainchild of Ruth Marks, an Ypsilanti native and art teacher who felt the strain of budget cuts on school art programs. Whitehouse explained that Marks started the program at Perry Elementary School, bringing all her own materials. \"Other people soon heard about what she was doing with this great mobile art studio, and they started asking her to please come to their schools, too,\" said Whitehouse, who began her time with Fly! volunteering weekly with kids who gathered at the Senior Center in Ypsilanti. \"I just loved it,\" said Whitehouse. \"I intended to do it just as something to do to help out in the community. And then I just fell in love with the kids!\" As Whitehouse continued her time with Fly!, Marks recognized her talents and tapped her for larger projects \u2014 first as a paid Fly! teacher, then as a grant writer and coordinator of summer programs. \"Then Ruth had an opportunity to go to San Francisco, and she asked me if I'd consider taking over Fly!\" said Whitehouse. \"That wasn't in my plans. I had a full-time, paying job all lined up elsewhere, but I just loved Fly! I came home and told my husband about the opportunity, and, fortunately, we decided that somehow we'd just make it work. We cobbled things together for a while with just volunteers \u2014 including with me as the volunteer executive director for a while. I did it because I believe in it. It's an organization that is worth an amount of personal sacrifice,\" she explained. In addition to their work in area public schools, Fly! has mobile art studio programming at the Parkridge and West Willow Community Centers. Whitehouse is grateful for the community members and organizations that helped sustain Fly! during its beginnings and that continue to support them today. \"Thankfully, the awesome people in this community stepped up to help us.

It's really important to give them control over their own artistic process.\" \u2014 Katie Whitehouse, Fly! Program DirectorFly! also holds workshops at the Whole Foods classrooms in Ann Arbor and at the Whittaker Road Library in Ypsilanti. Whitehouse said these free programs focus on art that children could make at home. For example, the popular series at Whole Foods uses common food items to create art. Participants make stamp art using cut vegetables, learn about vegetable-juice tie-dye, build towers from pasta and marshmallows, and create mosaics out of dried legumes. \"We want to show kids that they can make art out of the materials available to them. You might not have a drawer full of Sharpie markers at home, but you might have some beans, or an apple, or a sock. Art is not just a painting on the wall or a clay sculpture,\" Whitehouse said. These classes are offered free or at a very low cost. Whitehouse emphasized her appreciation for the continuing support of Ypsilanti and the surrounding communities. \"Every time we've hit a roadblock with Fly! we've found such generous and giving people with skills they are willing to lend. I could not have done it without them, and I cannot emphasize enough the phenomenal generosity of the people in this community. The support we get from this community is truly beyond amazing.\" Whitehouse said that there are numerous volunteer opportunities at Fly!, including helping with the mobile art studio school programs and contributing to work committees focusing on event planning, fundraising, and grant writing. Fly! Children's Art Center Katie Whitehouse, StreetYpsilanti, MI addition to a welcoming Blunden, this winter Fly! also made a much-needed move to a larger facility at 40 North Huron Street in Ypsilanti. The new studio space is more than four times larger than the old space, with room for additional studio classes, space for open houses and special events, and storage. \"We want to have an anchor in the community,\" said Whitehouse. \"We want people to be able to come and see what we are doing. The generous people who fund our programs will be able to come visit and see what we are doing with their investments.\" The larger space will also allow Fly! to expand its studio course, summer camp, and adult course offerings. In addition to the mobile art studio after-school programs that are free to all students, Fly! offers in-studio classes for children as young as age 3 up to adults. Whitehouse said that course offerings range from drop-in courses that cost approximately $5 for a one-hour class to a week-long summer puppet-making camp in collaboration with Dreamland Theater that culminates in a puppet show. Fly! also hosts \"ladies' nights out,\" adult craft parties for casual groups, bridal showers, and other special events. Whitehouse said that popular craft choices are knitting, crocheting, and jewelry-making. \"If a group wants to try something different, though, I will find someone who can teach it!\" Children's birthday parties are another popular Fly! offering. Themes include a fairy-themed tea party with wings and wands for children to make, a build-a-robot party, a superhero party during which kids create capes and crowns, and a marble-chute party that lets kids create a large, communal racing track, as well as smaller versions to take home. Fly! also offers art kits, which Whitehouse described as a \"take-home version of the Fly! open studio programs.\" These contain materials and project ideas perfect for kids who might prefer to work independently to make a project according to their own rules. These in-studio classes, parties, and art kits are fee-based activities that help fund the free mobile studio activities in the schools and community centers, said Whitehouse. \"People who choose to come here for our studio activities can feel really good about how their tuition funds creative art activities in under-resourced schools.\"The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2013 Page 65 \"People who choose to come here for our studio activities can feel really good about how their tuition funds creative art activities in under-resourced schools.\" \u2014 Katie WhitehouseContinued on page 66 734-274-4492 n rssaa.org admissions@steinerschool.orgThe educational foundation at The Rudolf Steiner School of Ann Arbor is built on the premise that knowledge is more than facts.

KINDERGARTEN ENROLLMENT SESSIONS April 30 May 14 & 28 June 11 & 25 1:30 pm At the Lower School 2775 Newport RoadThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2013 Page 66 Nature Learning Community \"I've always been fascinated with ancient lifeways \u2014 skills like tracking, fire- building, shelter-building, edible plants,\" said Rowena Conahan. With a degree in anthropology and certifications as a Montessori teacher and professional storyteller, Conahan taught preschool for years before realizing \"I wanted to be doing something that would create an even bigger ball of energy. That became very important to me.\" That \"bigger ball of energy\" became Ann Arbor's Nature Learning Community. Conahan began holding classes related to the natural world and ancient lifeways about five years ago and more formally started the Nature Learning Community in 2011. Current offerings include programming for children as young as age 3, older children, women, and family groups. Many of the classes offered by Nature Learning Community are held at Sunward Cohousing Community, located in Scio Township, just west of Ann Arbor. Sunward Cohousing owns 20 acres, but has built on only a small portion of that land, keeping the rest in its natural state of oak-hickory forest and native prairie. There are also two ponds, a wet meadow, and small pine forest. In the middle of this forest, Cohanan and her fellow Nature Learning Community teachers, along with their students, have built a primitive shelter that includes an indoor fire circle, an outdoor fire circle, a pit oven, and sheltered areas for gathering and enjoying class time together. During the past two years, Cohanan and the other teachers at Nature Learning Community have developed several classes for children, adults, and families. \"We're in a 'trying new things' phase,\" explained Conahan. \"We're working to see what's successful, what has good energy.\" One course that has been very popular is the \"Fuzzy Caterpillars\" course for the youngest children, ages three to six. For this class, every child comes with a grown-up. \"It's a time for kids and parents learning together,\" said Conahan. \"It's a time for the parents to sit in nature, to have tea and talk while the kids explore nature outside.\" The outdoor classroom space has tarps to provide shelter in inclement weather. \"One day we might bring in a 'nature museum' to spread on a blanket and let the children touch everything. We bring in wonderful things for kids to handle, to look at with magnifying glasses,\" she said. The children often go on a \"wander\" around the property, said Conahan. \"It's not an organized hike or a set path,\" explained Conahan. \"We let the children direct the play. They may find a log that looks like a boat and so we'll stop and play boat. Another child may want to make simple shelter shapes, and we can work on those together.\" Children may also have the chance to taste edible plants collected by adult teachers. \"At the end of each Fuzzy Caterpillars class, we come back together to tell each other the stories of our adventures that day,\" said Conahan. Nature Learning Community also offers several programs for older children. Conahan said that they draw kids from Ann Arbor and surrounding towns, including children from all three of Ann Arbor's co-housing communities, from homeschooling groups, and from other community groups. Nature Learning Community teacher Chuck Barbieri, an experienced Waldorf teacher who holds degrees in environmental studies and biology, as well as a graduate degree in environmental advocacy and education, coordinates the classes for school-aged children. Course offerings include an after-school hiking class that meets weekly to explore different parks around the Ann Arbor area and a nature art class that encourages children aged 4 to 11 to make mobiles, bird baths, and other crafts from natural materials. Barbieri emphasized that for older children, too, the goal of the programming is to give kids the opportunity to use their imaginations and connect with nature. \"We just let their imaginations run wild,\" he said. \"This isn't some kind of strict environmental education and science class to learn a set list of things,\" he explained. \"We want to let their imaginations loose in nature. That really nourishes children.\" Barbieri said that the classes offered at the Nature Learning Community \"take a holistic view, not just a scientific view. The traditional school curriculum offers a scientific view of learning, and that material can be so removed from a child's real experience. This nature is practical, understandable, and real to children.\" A recent children's class had a wonderful real encounter with coyotes, according to Conahan. The instructor had told a story about coyotes, and the children began howling like coyotes. \"It became something they did together \u2014 they howled together, and it became very passionate,\" she said. \"Then one day, they howled, and suddenly, real coyotes howled back to them. That was such a powerful moment. There was such a good energy with that class.\" In addition to the coyotes who pass through the property, the area is home to deer, raccoons, rabbits, skunks, opossums, mink, and numerous bird species. Children are encouraged to use a \"tracking box\" to learn what animals may visit at night: they place food items such as apple cores into a box filled with smooth, moist soil and look in the morning to see if they can identify the tracks of an animal that might have taken the snack. \"I wanted to be doing something that would create an even bigger ball of energy. That became very important to me.\" \u2014 Rowena Conahan, Nature Learning Community founder \"The traditional school curriculum offers a scientific view of learning, and that material can be so removed from a child's real experience. This nature is practical, understandable, and real to children.\" \u2014 Chuck Barbieri, Nature Learning Community teacherRowena Conahan \"Then one day, they howled, and suddenly, real coyotes howled back to them. That was such a powerful moment.\" \u2014 Rowena Conahan Crazy Wisdom Kids in the Community Continued from page 65The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2013 Page 67 Other activities for children and families include \"Family Fun Days,\" which are free of charge and don't require pre-registration. On these days the shelter is available, an outdoor fire is built, and various outdoor activities, such as work with animal hides, are available to observe and try. Nature Learning Community also coordinates Family Camp \u2014 a two-night outing at Friends Lake. Conahan explained that the camp is a nice way for people with different skills and levels of comfort with camping to come together to help each other. \"People with limited skills can get support from those with skills like building a fire, making a tent, cooking over a fire,\" she said. Another popular activity is the \"Edible Plant Walk,\" coordinated by high-school teacher and plant enthusiast George Hedgepeth, who leads walkers of all ages at the Mulberry Hill Farm in Saline. The next Edible Plant Walk is scheduled for May 4. Nature Learning Community also offers programs for adults. A \"Mama Bear Women's Class\" meets approximately once monthly on Friday evenings, encouraging women to come together around a fire inside the shelter to do craftwork, share stories, enjoy tea and soup, and learn new nature skills. In addition, a new book discussion group is reading and learning from Coyote's Guide to Connecting with Nature by Jon Young, Ellen Haas, and Evan McGown. The book group had an initial kick-off event at Crazy Wisdom and will continue to meet to discuss the book, which explores core routines for connecting with nature, as well as themes of mentoring and how one can learn from and mentor others. \"Connecting more people with mentoring is a goal of the book group,\" said Conahan, adding that they welcome new members. Conahan first learned of Jon Young at a class on the \"Art of Mentoring\" held about 15 years ago at Matthaei Botanical Gardens. \"It was absolutely amazing. Life changing. It helped form my vision for this energy ball we're starting here now.\" Conahan and Barbieri have plans for the Nature Learning Community that include mentoring and networking. They are working to develop a network of people in the region who teach traditional arts, to provide support for this work and create new events in hidework, pottery, basketry, shelter and fire-building, tracking, and other ancient skills. A summer camp in June for children aged seven and up will include nature crafts, fort building, and playing in the woods. In June, a \"Shelter Week\" also will be offered and will be aimed at bringing people together to improve Nature Learning Community's primitive shelter. Adults and children will collaborate to learn new skills as they add mud plaster to the shelter walls, build shelves, and create a covered outdoor work space, in addition to spending time together in the woods.

Box 3333Ann Arbor, MI 48106734-531-8330 (leave a message)http://nature-class.orgaanatureschool@gmail.com The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2013 Page 68 By Karen Foulke Larson What does it take to create professional theater that entertains adults and children? For 33 years, Wild Swan Theater has found a unique formula for entertaining theatergoers of all ages, and it doesn't involve elaborate sets or huge casts. In 1980, four friends collaborated to create Wild Swan Theater with the goal of \"making good theater for kids.\" Two of the women responsible for starting Wild Swan, Sandy Ryder and Hilary Cohen, still serve as co-artistic directors. The creation of Wild Swan Theater was inspired by a University of Michigan theater project that involved adolescent patients at a psychiatric hospital. Cohen, a professor of theater at University of Michigan, and two of her theater students, Julia Wolfe and Raizel Weiss-Heitzer, all thought having the teenagers collaborate was a powerful experience and so they decided to build on what they'd learned. They invited Ryder to join them in starting Wild Swan Theater.Wild Swan was initially a part-time job for both Cohen and Ryder, but it kept growing. The four women are still friends, but Wolfe and Weiss-Heitzer moved away after graduation. After 14 years, Wild Swan grew to the point that Ryder and Cohen needed to make it their full-time work. Cohen taught and directed as a professor of theater at the University of Michigan for 20 years before making Wild Swan her full-time occupation. Ryder's career has included a variety of theatrical roles, including clown, mime, and improv actor in a children's theater. She sold her business, Ann Arbor's popular Say Cheese Cheesecake, in order to give Wild Swan her full attention. An Increased Level of Accessibility Accessibility was one of the original goals of Wild Swan Theater. Cohen and Ryder have created a unique way to include American Sign Language (ASL) into all Wild Swan productions. Registered ASL interpreters who have been trained as actors sign on stage, in costume, and are part of the scenes (instead of standing to the side of the stage and signing). Audience members don't have to look away from the action to see the signing. It was also a creative decision to have the \"visual beauty of sign language add another dimension to the production.\" Ryder said that integrating ASL adds emotion to the performances. \"Touch tours\" can be arranged ahead of performances for visually impaired children and adults. Theatergoers who are blind or have limited vision go backstage before the performance to meet cast members and to feel costumes, puppets, and musical instruments, to be familiar with them before the play begins. Meeting the actors and hearing their voices ahead of time is also an important part of the tour, helping theatergoers to recognize the characters' voices when the play begins. Visually impaired audience members can use a small receiver and earphone that will permit them to hear a description of the sets, costumes, and action of the play when there are pauses in the dialogue. This system, called \"audio-description,\" allows audience members who are blind to have access to the visual information expressed in a play. Users of the system are able to hear the dialogue just as the rest of the audience does. Ryder recalled a story that a blind parent shared with her after a performance. The dad attended a performance with his son who was not old enough to read. Because the dad was listening to the \"audio-description,\" he was able to answer his son's question about what a sign said. \"He told me it was one of the first times he was able to answer his child's question about something that he saw,\" said Ryder.

The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2013 Page 69 Home Stage and Touring Wild Swan's mission of making theater accessible to everyone, including low income, minority, and disabled children, is extended through low ticket prices and innovative outreach programs. The vast majority of their performances are in the Ann Arbor area. For many years, they performed at the Towsley Auditorium at Washtenaw Community College. Ryder said the location works well because it is easily accessible from Ann Arbor and Ypsilanti freeways and has space for wheelchairs. Wild Swan also has touring performances that go to schools, libraries, and other communities, performing approximately 130 shows on the road each year. As the enrichment coordinator at Angell School in Ann Arbor, Joan Singer coordinates activities that support the school's curriculum. She is grateful that Wild Swan makes theater accessible and affordable for school groups. She called Wild Swan a \"premiere professional children's theater\" and believes it is important for students to have the experience of a live, professional performance. An added benefit of a Wild Swan production is the learning opportunities before and after performances. Singer said that teachers are very enthusiastic about the study guides. For example, Shipwrecked, a show about Shipwreck Alley on Lake Huron, has a 40-page study guide online that includes maps, letters, and even the lyrics of the \"The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald,\" a song about one of the most famous shipwrecks on the Great Lakes. Shipwrecked has been performed at unique places rich with maritime history. A grant from the Michigan Humanities Council, an affiliate of the National Endowment for the Humanities, supported a tour to sites like the Great Lakes Shipwreck Museum in Whitefish Point and the Thunder Bay National Marine Sanctuary in Alpena. This summer it will be performed in the Upper Peninsula. The Power of Music Live music is something that Wild Swan followers are accustomed to enjoying. Cohen said, \"Music is another language to add to the piece.\" The music is original with a few exceptions, like the production of Little Women that benefited from using pieces composed during that time. Continued on page 70 In addition to a special line up of performances at Washtenaw Community College, Wild Swan Theater tours with several shows. Under the African Sky includes a collection of African tales performed through storytelling, acting, dancing and drumming and involves audience participation.

The actors are adults. Written by Ann Arbor playwright Jeff Duncan, Shipwrecked! was created to tell a good story and motivate theatergoers to discuss and learn more about protecting our Great Lakes.

She has been a fan of Wild Swan Theater for 30 years. During the 20 years of her career when she taught at Burns Park Elementary, Wild Swan would visit the school every year to perform for the students. It is impossible for Page-Bogen to choose a single favorite show or favorite music because she has so many favorites. She said, \"I love that live music is part of it.\" Musicians are visible during Wild Swan productions and Cohen said it is \"very important for kids to see what makes the music.\" She appreciates the wealth of local talent, adding, \"It is such a lovely thing about Ann Arbor.\" Among the many nationally known musicians who have been part of Wild Swan productions is Peter \"Madcat\" Ruth, who performed for The Spirit of Harriet Tubman in 2012. Becoming Part of the Story Page-Bogen also appreciates the audience participation and the fun question and answer session the actors and musicians have after a show. Cohen said, \"A pretty bare stage is one of the hallmarks of our plays. The audience enters in through their imaginations and fills things in themselves.\" For example, music helps the audience imagine a tremendous storm in Shipwrecked. The \"Talk Back\" session after school performances provides a chance for students and teachers to have their questions answered. Hawk, I'm Your Brother is a play about a Native American boy, Rudy Soto, who longs to fly. At a pivotal moment when Rudy decides to let the hawk fly free, the puppeteer for the bird is in full view, yet a student in the audience was so immersed in the action that he asked, \"How did you make the hawk fly?\" Cohen said, \"The questions are wonderful. Sometimes they are funny. Sometimes they are moving.\" Some questions don't have answers. As an example, Cohen relayed the plot of one of Wild Swan's shows, in which three children, transported through Ann Arbor on the Underground Railroad to leave a life of slavery, spend a night in a barn on their way to Canada. The play ends without the audience knowing whether the children get to Canada, leaving the students to contemplate what happened. She said that uncertainty is a great teaching moment. Wild Swan productions have unique opportunities for audience participation. In some shows, the audience interacts with the performers, like in Jack in the Beanstalk when Jack asks the audience for advice. During Under the African Sky, the audience learns dances and chants that they do in their seats. The audience creates a \"spring like\" atmosphere for Frog and Toad by making sounds of spring animals and creating the sound and motion of wind to help Frog and Toad fly their kite. In Owl's Winter, the audience creates a surprise for the main character. Owl keeps checking his mailbox, which is empty for most of the show. Toward the end of the show, the audience is asked if they would like to send a letter to Owl. The ushers pass out paper and crayons to everyone so they can write a letter to Owl. It is a very magical moment when Owl checks his mailbox and finds it overflowing with all of the letters. Wild Swan also offers a variety of workshops throughout the year for different ages and abilities, including people with developmental disabilities. There are even special workshops for teachers. They also offer a series of popular summer camps. In all of the workshops and camps, the Wild Swan staff work to provide a safe and comfortable way for participants to explore the imaginative world of theater. Creating Community Michelle Trame Lanzi became the company manager in 1991, dividing her time between managing Wild Swan's touring program and appearing in productions. She said Cohen and Ryder are like family to her, and the great spirit of collaboration extends to the actors, writers, and musicians. For those who haven't seen Wild Swan Theater performances, it helps to know that \"children's theater\" doesn't mean performances by children. The actors are adults. Wild Swan has a suggested age range for each show based on the content, but the shows are also entertaining for adults. Marie Cregar and her children Grace, age 10, and Dylan, age 6, have attended Wild Swan productions since Dylan was a baby. Cregar said, \"I think if you have kids in elementary or middle school, Wild Swan is one of the best things about living in Ann Arbor.\" Cregar said that the seamless integration of interpreters for the hearing impaired creates a sense that \"we're all part of this.\" She said that Wild Swan is very inclusive. \"Kids walk away with a wonderful sense of community.\" Grace has enjoyed the summer camps and after school workshops. Dylan is looking forward to going to camp this summer too. \"Wild Swan is an important part of our lives,\" Cregar said. \"They make every kid feel special.\" Transitions The past year has had some unexpected hurdles. In March 2012, after five years of leasing a space on Maple Road, Wild Swan was abruptly told by their landlord to vacate its space in 30 days. The news was particularly troublesome because it was a month when there was literally one day available for packing and moving. Instead of focusing on the difficulty of the situation, Lanzi shared how much they Wild Swan Soars Continued from page 69 Making a Story Come Alive. You might know the story of Jack and the Beanstalk, Peter Rabbit, and Charlotte's Web, but experiencing it as a Wild Swan Theater production invites a whole new appreciation of each classic story. Here is the Charlotte's Web cast pictured in 2010. (Front Row): Anne Marie Damman, Lise Lacasse, Rebecca Lanzi, Jeremy Salvatori, Mark Hammell, Jamie Fidler.Sandy Ryder and Hilary Cohen Musicians are visible during Wild Swan productions....

Ryder said, \"It was a good lesson in how amazing this town is.\" Joanna Hastings, head of Summers-Knoll, a small, independent elementary school on Platt across from County Farm Park, offered them space. \"We owe a lot to Joanna Hastings,\" said Ryder. \"We love Summers-Knoll.\" Summers-Knoll already had existing plans for using that area in 2013, so as soon as Wild Swan moved in the team began looking for new home. After an extensive search, they found their new location on Jackson Road. The new space includes two studios. One studio is for Arts in Motion Dance Studio and Wild Swan and Arts in Motion share the other. Like many non-profits, Wild Swan Theater's budget has been adversely impacted by the poor economy. Large grants that they were able to count on for many years are no longer available to anyone. Ryder said, \"Individual businesses and individual people are the reason we are still alive.\" Because cuts to school funding have reduced the number of school performances and workshops for kids with disabilities, the Wild Swan team is always in search of donors to support these programs. Wild Swan Theater has two major fundraisers each year. Every October there is a benefit concert at The Ark featuring the talented musicians who have been part of Wild Swan productions. Cohen said, \"We love that everybody who performs has worked with Wild Swan.\" The other is their biggest fundraiser, the annual Chocolate Crush in February. Chocolate is one of the highlights of the evening, but the live and silent auctions help raise money that is critical to staying afloat. Commitment to Its Mission After three decades in the community, Wild Swan has established a strong legacy. Parents who grew up with Wild Swan are now bringing their children to shows. Cohen said about Ryder, \"It is a beautiful partnership, and we have learned a lot from each other.\" Cohen added, \"Sandy and I feel so grateful to do this work we love.\" Ryder chuckled when she said that 33 years ago they \"never dreamed it would last this long.\" Clearly Cohen and Ryder still have the same passion and enthusiasm for creating the best theater possible that they started with three decades ago. Whether it a workshop, a camp, or a performance, Wild Swan Theater is telling stories that give audiences of all ages the opportunity to join, imagine, wonder, and enjoy. The 2012-2013 season ended with performances of Charlotte's Web in April. The 2013-2014 season begins in September. Information about purchasing tickets, enrolling in camps and classes, and details about fundraising events are available on their website, www.wildswantheater.org.A middle school student in the Commedia Dell'arte summer camp plays the character Brighella.

Of course, in saying \"The fairies came to me...\" Boyd is not relating an actual visitation by fairies. Rather, she is vividly recalling a long plane ride from Michigan to Montana seven years ago, during which she drew two fairies in her sketchbook. \"It soon became a happy passion for me,\" Boyd said. She continued her flight of fancy, drawing the fairies all the time, even surreptitiously during non-art classes at the Rudolf Steiner High School. Soon her art teacher there, Elena Efimova, suggested she exhibit her drawings. That exhibit led to Boyd's creating a fairy calendar and note cards and selling them at the school's annual Holiday Bazaar. So genuine and convincing were her drawings that children, and even adults, asked her, \"Have you ever seen a fairy?\" She began drawing the fairies with children she babysat. \"One boy went on to paper his entire room with pictures of Michigan sports fairies (Michigan hockey fairy, Michigan basketball fairy),\" Boyd said. Parents began asking her to teach their children how to draw fairies. Simultaneously with her passion for drawing fairies, Boyd was also nourishing her musical abilities. Already an accomplished violinist and composer in high school, Boyd, now 22, is in her final semester studying composition at Roosevelt University in Chicago. And lest you think that someone who talks about hosting visits from fairies is not well-grounded in practical life, think again. In addition to her artistic endeavors, Boyd has also shown an energetic entrepreneurial spirit. That impulse, along with a strong sense of wanting to foster creativity in young people led her to create the first Fresh Air and Fairies Camp in the summer of 2011. The weeklong summer camps are held in Boyd's parents' backyard and house on the western outskirts of Ann Arbor. The large, hilly yard, surrounded by tall trees and bordered by a dry creek bed, is an ideal setting for the camp's focus \u2014 allowing and encouraging young people's imaginations to roam and bloom. Young campers go on nature walks; learn to identify trees, shrubs, and flowers; and build and decorate fairy houses using twigs, leaves, and moss. Boyd, who is tall, with light brown hair framing the dewy good looks you'd expect of one who communes closely with fairies, flits between her young charges, asking open-ended questions such as, \"What do you think a fairy would use this for?\" The answers are delightful; strawberries and roses are fairy lipstick, dew is fairy lip-gloss, and Boyd's favorite came from a little girl who held up a pinecone and said, \"Look! A fairy chandelier!\" And the children learn to draw fairies. Either in the shade of a tall tree or, when weather does not permit, in the Boyds' dining room, the young fairy artists bend over their drawings and work intently while Boyd moves between them, offering soft encouragement \u2014 \" Very good. Fairy good!\" A nd she also answers questions. \" How do you know where to draw the shadows?\" asks a little girl. Boyd replies, \"If the sun is up here, what part doesn't the sun reach?\" As the children draw, soft music plays in the background; \"Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairies,\" of course, or one of Boyd's own compositions. \" I won a competition in Chicago last year and now have a really great recording of a string orchestra piece based on my Fairy Camp nature walks. I use this during quiet drawing sessions \u2014 there are also loud drawing sessions \u2014 to help children's imaginations wander.\" Simultaneously with her passion for drawing fairies, Boyd was also nourishing her musical abilities.

At the end of the final session, parents are invited to view their children's creations, and the campers get to \"take home their own How to Draw Fairies book that shows their own drawings of fairy eyes, ears, all types of fairy wings, fairy hair, etc.,\" Boyd said. Boyd's experiences in leading her Fairy Camps have also inspired her to begin teaching composition to middle-school and high-school students. Last summer she was Composer in Residence for the Pioneer Orchestra Interlochen Camp and also for the JVL Summer School of Performing Arts in Canada. This summer, in addition to leading several Fresh Air and Fairies Camp sessions in Ann Arbor and in Chicago, she will also be Composer in Residence at the Cremona International Music Academy in Italy. \"Though the students in the music and Fairy Camps differ in age, I teach with the same approach: to listen first to their own creative intuition.\" In her own art, compositions, and teaching, Boyd said she seeks to \"bring whimsical worlds to life, and refresh and strengthen the creative spirit.\" For more information about Stephanie Boyd and her Fresh Air and Fairies Camps, please visit freshairandfairies.com, or write to freshairandfairies@gmail.com.The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2013 Page 73 This summer, in addition to leading several Fresh Air and Fairies Camp sessions in Ann Arbor and in Chicago, Boyd will also be Composer in Residence at the Cremona International Music Academy in Italy.Fairy Camp nature walks Fairy by Stephanie Boyd Friday is fairy dress-up day at Fresh Air and Fairies Camp.

Life sometimes seems like a rolling, turbulent river threatening to drown us and destroy the world. Pema Chodron teaches that reacting with fear-based patterns keeps us from the more satisfying experience of being fully alive. When we learn to let go of our protective patterns, we see not only how much better it is to live that way, but we begin to naturally reach out to others in care and support.June 19: King Peggy: An American Secretary, Her Royal Destiny, and the Inspiring Story of How She Changed an African Village by Peggielene Bartels and Eleanor Herman, hosted by Crysta Coburn This books chronicles the astonishing journey of an American secretary who suddenly finds herself ruler of a town of 7,000 people on Ghana' s central coast, half a world away. In the end, a deeply traditional African town is uplifted by the ambitions of its decidedly modern female king, and Peggy herself is transformed from an ordinary secretary to the heart and hope of her community.July 31: Detroit: An American Autopsy by Charlie LeDuff, hosted by Jasmine Zweifler If Detroit is America's vanguard in good times and bad, then here is the only place to turn for guidance in our troubled era.

LeDuff shares an unbelievable story of a hard town in a rough time filled with some of the strangest and strongest people our country has to of fer. Detroit is a dark comedy of the absurdity of American life in the 21st century, a deeply human drama of colossal greed and endurance, ignorance and courage.Aug. 21: Spontaneous Evolution: Our Positive Future (And a Way to Get There from Here) by Bruce Lipton and Steve Bhaerman, hosted by Rachel Pastiva Today's leading-edge science is shattering old myths and rewriting the story that will shape the future of human civilization.

By Leslie Blackburn I am at a Thai yoga massage weekend immersion retreat, enjoying the lush experience of meditative, centering, deep inquiry into my own essence, while being supported by others. The feeling of deep familiarity, ancient memory rekindled... present, aware touch; slowed down breath; conscious movement from the core of my very being. Inspiration flows as I connect the dots: this foundational physical reality of breath, sound, movement, touch, and visualization is a divine spider web, illuminating a path of self-realization. Sacred Sexuality is an energetic healing path of authenticity that seeks to unwind distortions and uncover truth through the wisdom encoded in our own bodies. I established Mystery School of the Temple Arts in Dearborn, Michigan, with a clear purpose to empower deep personal healing on both individual and interpersonal levels. Using a synthesis of sexual practices \u2014 many drawn from the esoteric and hidden knowledge of the past, and fusing them with the needs of the emerging men and women of the 21st century \u2014 I work with others to find and and society have often separated the sacredness from the body and all of nature. This division of mind from body, and the sacred from the mundane, has served to drive us away from the fundamental truth of Oneness. The systems that have been the sources of learning about sexuality in our lifetimes \u2014 religion, popular culture, and public education \u2014 have been permeated by the distortion that our own bodies are not to be trusted. Yet, our sexual energy is the most fundamental creative force in the Universe. It's what conceived us and every other life form throughout time! I invite you to explore this reality: that which is physical and sexual cannot be separated from that which is spiritual and sexual. Regardless of gender or sexuality, we are a combination of feminine and masculine energies, and a state of balance is what we're striving toward. We experience our masculine energy as very fiery and active; outward; getting things done in the world; analytical thinking; doing A-B-C to get D. The complement to that is our feminine energy, which is experienced as being; allowing; meditative; cooling; receptive; inward. She's the facet of ourselves that feels our emotions and connects with the wisdom within our body. Currently, the feminine nature is not as honored or as easily accessible, but that is changing as we reconnect with our own divine natures. The rise of the Divine Feminine and integration with the Healthy Masculine is the core foundational work for us in society now. Sacred Sexuality is a powerful path for coming back into balance and has been instrumental in the ways I have learned to love myself and step into my own power. The first half of my life was imbued with very analytical, masculine energy. I experienced traumatic events in my childhood that initiated the sequence of shutting down feelings and sensations, divorcing me from my Divine Feminine essence. I remember making two conscious choices: to numb out and not feel because then I wouldn't hurt so much, and to not let anyone into my life. I committed to doing it all myself, on a path of isolation and disconnection from my needs and truth. Thus began the erection of walls around my body and heart, the barriers and body armor that stopped me from allowing feelings and sensations to emerge within me. I continued down an unbalanced path of accomplishment and recognition as an endurance athlete and corporate leader. I Spiraling Into Ourselves: The Energetic Healing Path of Sacred Sexuality connect with their power. I help them discover their path to healing, self-knowledge, and personal transformation. The essence of working with energy in the body is about balance and finding healing in both the feminine and masculine aspects of ourselves. Integrating them together creates wholeness in our body, which projects outwardly into our lives. This method has powerful potential for emotional release, improving our health, and creating richer and more meaningful relationships with others. It is about manifesting our heart's desires and walking a path of connection with ultimate bliss, enlightenment, and the divine. It is a lifestyle and calling, offering far more possibilities than simply recreational or procreational sex. Sacred Sexuality. Pairing these words may seem contradictory. At this moment in time many of us equate sexuality with perversion and addiction or guilt and shame. Over thousands of years, culture This method has powerful potential for emotional release, improving our health, and creating richer and more meaningful relationships with others.Leslie Blackburn is a Sacred Sexual Healer & Transformational Guide, sexual shaman, yogini, Reiki master, artist, and seminar leader. She is the founder of One Space, LLC, and Mystery School of the Temple Arts.The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2013 Page 82If you are drawn to these words, perhaps something has called you to exploring this more deeply.

Career-wise, I spent 15 \"successful\" years in corporate engineering and management before getting to a point of recognizing deep within my body that I needed to make a change. I was burned out and unbalanced when a lightning bolt from the divine suddenly shifted everything. It was time to slow down, let go of the reins, and listen. That crack-open experience, which I call my spiritual awakening, arrived with pregnancy and the birth of my daughter. I was approaching my deep desire to have a baby with the same analytical mind that had accomplished so much and it wasn't working. Tracking my basal body temperatures in Excel spreadsheets and having sex on the \"right days,\" surely that would get the job done, right? It wasn't until much later, after fertility treatments that didn't work, and a miscarriage, that I let go...viscerally. I found myself in tears in a heap on the ground feeling no longer able to continue. And I let it go. I mean really let it go at a body level, not just intellectually. I was no longer on the active quest for having a baby, as much as my heart wanted one. I released it. I made other plans in life. I began to just be. It was literally that month that it happened. I woke up one day not even sure what cycle day I was on and just felt it. I took a test, and sure enough I was pregnant! The lightning bolt of awakening had struck and I was unable to continue life as the woman I had been before motherhood. As I healed and expanded vis-\u00e0-vis connection with my own inner power and truth, I felt called to support others at a very deep level. The Photo by Miguel Leslie Blackburn performing her work \"Emergence\" I moved from tight, contracted, bound-up, dark energy, to releasing the binds that hold me back and allowing an emergence of my authentic light. My spirit name is Light Bearer, and I felt that core authenticity move through me in this piece.The systems that have been the sources of learning about sexuality in our lifetimes \u2014 religion, popular culture, and public education \u2014 have been permeated by the distortion that our own bodies are not to be trusted. For me, exploring the aerial arts have been about expanding my body awareness and healing through a balance of commitment and the willingness to let go! Universe provided many synchronistic teachers and lessons to guide me on my new path of Sacred Sexuality. Traveling to Egypt and Peru on two sacred journeys helped me to further realize and embody these ancient wisdoms. I began training as a Priestess of the Ancient Temple Arts, including sacred sexual healing and emotional release, and received my Sacred Sexual Shamanic Practitioners Training (Daka/Dakini Intensive) Certificate from the Sedona Temple & International School of Temple Arts. My teachings blend experience and training in Tantra, Sacred Sexuality, Taoism, Yoga, Shamanism, Meditation, QiGong, Movement, Visual Arts, Music, Vibrational Dynamics and other modalities. My work is a fusion of Art meets Science and East meets West. By working with energy through breath, sound, movement, visualization, and touch, I support myself and others to tap into this vast realm of possibility within their energetic and sexual core. In addition to the powerful experiential modalities of tapping into the energy directly, I encourage open discussion about the often taboo topics of sexuality, orgasmic repertoire, female ejaculation, male ejaculatory choice, consciousness, tantra, polyamory, alternative relationships, kink, and sexual and gender identity. I provide a safe space to help people accept that it is ok to feel pleasure, love, and bliss. I teach safe ways to support yourself in your own sexual awareness and expansion. It has been four and half years since I took a leap of faith by leaving the economic safety of my corporate life. I believe sacred sexuality encompasses what we need to do for healthy living on the planet; how we eat, breathe, work, talk, give birth, die. All of it.

It's about learning to let the healing energy of unconditional love flow through you, to the animal, from the Oneness. We give Natural Spiritual Healing through the hands, with or without touch, letting the love do the work. There is no set format for giving healing to animals; it's about flowing with them and the healing energy, and adjusting to their temperament and movement, as they are all different and it's not realistic to expect them to hold still. Animals that are happy with touch often \"present\" the area they would like healing for \u2014 rolling onto their back or putting a sore leg out. Wild or abused animals and a number of farm/herd animals would be disturbed if the healer touched them, so healing would be given from a comfortable, safe distance for both the animal and the healer. There is no limit to the healing energy other than in our minds, which is why healing can be sent to an animal at any distance, from a few feet away to across the world. Healers can also use their eyes and voice to help calm and reassure an animal if they intuitively feel it's needed. My special needs horse, Odie, helped me to believe in Natural Spiritual Healing. I was somewhat skeptically \u2014 ok, very skeptically \u2014 receiving Natural Spiritual Healing to help with my own recurring bronchitis and mental/emotional challenges. I thought I was mainly going for the talking part of the appointment; Odie helped me to see more. He was born on a farm that strived to produce very large horses by over-supplementing them at a very young age. He grew rapidly, but developed neurological problems before he was a year old. He could sort of walk and canter, but one back leg wasn't really under his control. He had a very calm, sweet nature though, so someone bought him in hopes that he could be saved. He saw lots of vets who said don't bother, he will always be dangerous to ride because his back leg didn't work right. One vet said throw him in the pasture, don't feed him any grain, don't look at him for six months, and then let's look again. He got better enough that they kept trying. He grew to over 17 hands tall and very long. I started working with him when he was six. The back leg issue never went away, but with lots of patient work he became ride-able. However, he was a very \"hard-keeper,\" unable to gain weight, even with 18 lbs of grain, good pasture, and lots of hay every day \u2014 that's a 50 lb bag of grain every two and half days! And he had trouble with his hooves cracking and breaking (nature's way of keeping his back ones trimmed since he Natural Spiritual Healing for Animals Animals that are happy with touch often \"present\" the area they would like healing for \u2014 rolling onto their back or putting a sore leg out.

Practicing the in-depth, Pure Meditation as healers helps us to connect with the Oneness and unconditional love on a daily basis, thus developing and deepening our link.

Through the two-day Animal Healing Course you can learn to give healing to animals yourself, to use this beautiful discipline professionally or in your own home. The only qualification needed is a love and respect for animals. A holistic approach is used in order to deepen our understanding of the balance between animals, people, and the world in which we live. By seeing the body/mind/spirit as interconnected levels, and honoring each as having an important role, every aspect of an animal's being is able to benefit from the healing.

I thought I'd see if healing could help him. After just a few visits, he started changing. Pretty rapidly we reduced his grain to about five lbs a day \u2014 he was actually fat at one point! This really helped me to believe in healing, because you can't talk a horse into getting better. There are a few other stories that convinced me that the Natural Spiritual Healing technique helps animals. We helped a cat that was almost blind in one eye and was very nervous around people, with a tendency to scratch. One of his parents was feral. He was adopted by two of our trained animal healers and began having regular healing. You could see him change as the months went by. He is now much more relaxed and tolerant of people, and only scratches if provoked. Now, when he is receiving healing, he will allow the healer to touch him and he purrs away happily. Another rescue, an Alsatian-Labrador cross, was adopted by students of the Self Realization Meditation Healing Centre Animal Healing Course. He had a very nervous temperament, and used to run away whenever the owners approached the broom closet. They think he had been physically abused before the rescue center took him in. Having regular healing helped him be a much more relaxed and settled companion. Later in life he lost an eye and was given healing regularly, including before and after surgery. The vet commented how amazed he was at how quickly the wound from the operation healed. The last story I'll share with you is one of a sheep that had diarrhea problems for years, despite a very caring, responsible owner who ensured excellent vet care, proper food, and had tried probiotics and a number of spiritual/energy healing methods she was practicing. Nothing \"solved\" it for this ewe. She was one of a small herd and none of the others had the problem. She received Natural Spiritual Healing twice; the first time when we visited her farm to talk to the owner about the possibility of hands-on practice and the second time when two of the students gave her herd a healing. She's been fine ever since and no longer earns her nickname \"Poopy\"! Although healers cannot guarantee a cure or that a particular problem be \"fixed,\" all animals that receive Natural Spiritual Healing can benefit, and many receive help with physical illness, injury, or behavior problems. Now, I cannot say for certain, but I do feel that not only the way that we practice healing, but also the clarity and dedication of the healer make a difference. Remember it's about allowing the healing energy of unconditional love flow through you, to the animal, from the Oneness. That year, all the students were Another rescue, an Alsatian-Labrador cross, had a very nervous temperament... They think he had been physically abused before the rescue center took him in. Having regular healing helped him be a much more relaxed and settled companion.Not only the way that we practice healing, but also the clarity and dedication of the healer make a difference.

By Karen Husby-Coupland Photography by Pam Lindberg When I ask newcomers to my yoga classes why they decided to try yoga, I get many different answers. Some say they hope it will help with a specific problem they have, such as back pain or arthritis. Others say they want to develop more flexibility and strength to complement their other physical activities. Sometimes it's stress relief that people are looking for. And still others just want to find a fun program of physical activity that makes them feel better overall. Those who end up staying with the class do so primarily because they feel better afterward. During each yoga class, I guide students into different postures through moving and stretching different areas of their bodies that may not get much attention otherwise. By following my instructions for doing these yoga postures, or asanas , students bring awareness to many different parts of their body and to how these parts are connected with each other. After class, I'll often hear remarks from students that they feel better than Yoga Builds Awareness ~ The Practice of Yoga, D one with Awareness and Intelligent Action, Enhances our Physical and Emotional Well-Being In Iyengar yoga classes, such as the classes I teach, the instructor demonstrates how to safely do these postures \u2014 giving simple instructions of where and how to place the different parts of the body, such as the legs, arms, trunk, and head to form the basic shapes of the asanas . We learn how to extend the limbs and how to work with different joints. We learn which muscles to keep strong and firm, and which to keep soft and relaxed. Once we can understand and follow these basic instructions, we're then given more complex instructions, to bring the postures into better alignment, and do so with more ease and integrity. This is eye-opening for most of us! Who knew it was so difficult to keep the legs straight or the chest open? Or that our upper back may be dull and stiff while our lower back brings us pain if we're not careful? Or that it takes so much effort to maintain good posture in a simple seated or standing position? Over time, we're made aware of each and every part of our body because our they did when they came in \u2014 that they feel refreshed and alert, even though the class may have been difficult for them. Most of us go through our lives being only partially aware of ourselves and of what's going on around us. If we move without awareness or intelligence, we reinforce bad habits that can lead to injury and ill-health. The practice of yoga helps us become more aware \u2014 first, of our physical body as we learn to do the different yoga postures, then of our mental and emotional makeup as well. This greater awareness helps us to understand ourselves more fully, including how we respond to the world around us. This may sound esoteric to some, but yoga is a very practical method of self-study and for improving health and well-being on all levels \u2014 and its methods and benefits are available to all. We start this self-study on the physical level by learning and practicing the yoga postures. The practice of yoga helps us become more aware \u2014 first, of our physical body as we learn to do the different yoga postures, then of our mental and emotional makeup as well. Most of us go through our lives being only partially aware of ourselves and of what's going on around us.attention is directed to all of these parts. As our awareness develops, we can move more deeply into the poses with more intelligence and less chance of injury. We continue our self-study as this practice of awareness spills into all other areas of our daily lives. We begin to observe how we react to different situations and can then determine if our reactions are helpful or harmful. We learn to make better decisions in difficult situations. As with continued observation and practice of the physical poses, this also takes time and practice.Karen Husby-Coupland is a certified Iyengar yoga teacher and the owner of Harmony Yoga of Ann Arbor.The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2013 Page 104When I first decided to try yoga, I chose to take Iyengar yoga classes at the Ann Arbor YMCA. I already had a strong interest in holistic health practices, and I had heard that this method of yoga could be used therapeutically. I read that yoga master Sri B.K.S. Iyengar had refined this yoga method from his own practice and insights. He had experienced that creating space and optimal alignment in the body through different yoga poses promoted increased health and well-being throughout the entire body, including the physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual layers. I liked this idea of creating better overall health through intelligently using my own body,but practicing was much more difficult than I had anticipated. I started yoga with a habitual slouch, shoulder problems, and very tight hamstrings. I found the poses difficult, the instructions sometimes arcane and contradictory, and my body unwilling to do what was being asked of it. I had sore muscles after most classes. But I usually felt great afterward in many ways, and I enjoyed my learning process. With ongoing practice and excellent guidance from my teachers, I became stronger and more flexible, and I developed an awareness of how to use my body more intelligently. I loved how this practice of yoga made me feel, and I loved to talk about it with others. Eventually it seemed natural for me to share this with others in a more formal way. I took Iyengar yoga teacher-training classes and workshops, became certified, and started teaching my own classes. In my classes I observe that, as students become more aware of how their bodies work, they see how difficult actions can become simpler. For some, this might be learning to get up from the floor with more ease. For others, it might be the ability to balance with good form in headstand. As students develop and continue their practice, they become aware of which parts of the body are dull and stiff and are not working well, and which areas move too freely and need to be restrained. The practice of yoga is just that \u2014 a practice. Progress comes from using our awareness to maintain an ongoing and intelligent practice, whether it is for improving our yoga postures or for learning to react mindfully to other situations that arise in our lives. In the prologue of his book Light on the Y oga Sutras of Patanjali, B.K.S. Iyengar says, \"Body, mind, and spirit are inseparable: if the body is asleep, the soul is asleep.\" In our practice of yoga, we wake up the body, bringing awareness to each and every part; and in an extension of that, we bring awareness to all layers of our being. It's an endlessly fascinating practice that wakes us up to our own potential.

How do these relate to one another and which is better for self-defense or health cultivation? How is it that a fighting art like Tai Chi can have such profound health benefits? To answer these questions, we will begin with Qigong as this is the precursor to the \"soft\" martial arts Tai Chi, Ba Gua, and Xin Yi. While traditional, hard style martial arts emphasize muscle strength or momentum for martial power, the soft martial arts use relaxed, integrated body structure to absorb oncoming assaults and project force externally. The methods to develop this integrated structure come from the health practices of Qigong. Qigong The words Qi and Gong translate as \"energy\" and \"skill\" respectively. Developed thousands of years ago in China, Qigong can sometimes include non-moving meditations or social practices. However, the vast majority of Qigong involves gentle, meditative movements, often coordinated with breathwork or visualization. While other forms of exercise emphasize stretching, muscle building, or cardiovascular health, Qigong movements promote natural range of motion to relax and integrate the spaces between muscle, bone, and connective tissue. When these tiny spaces open, the body's Qi/energy can flow freely through the meridians of Chinese medicine, and, as a result, the body is affected much like an acupuncture treatment. In general, this type of relaxed, integrated structure cannot develop through hard, strong intent/will, as this restricts the meridians and stagnates Qi. Instead, it is accomplished through \"intent-less intent\" \u2014 that which develops from Wu Wei (literally \"non-doing\" or \"effortless action\"). Through the very non-active process of relaxing/softening restrictions, a natural integrated structure will effortlessly emerge. This approach is summarized in the ancient Taoist proverb, \"Tao fa zi ran\" - the method of the Tao is what naturally arises. Tai Chi Chuan Over time certain principles of Qigong have become integrated with martial techniques to create art forms that cultivate health while training the body to effortlessly deliver deadly force to an opponent. The most famous of these arts is Tai Chi Chuan, attributed to the 16 th century Taoist sage Chan San Feng. Tai translates as \"great\" and Chi translates as \"extreme\" or \"ultimate.\" The term Tai Chi (\"great ultimate\") refers to what is often called the \"Yin-Yang\" concept. According to Taoist theory, the interactions of these two cosmic forces generated Exploring Qigong and ThE \"SofT\" M arTial arTS: Tai Chi, Ba gua, and xin Yi While traditional, hard style martial arts emphasize muscle strength or momentum for martial power, the soft martial arts use relaxed, integrated body structure to absorb oncoming assaults and project force externally. Tai Chi Chuan, translating as \"great ultimate boxing,\" is a practice that integrates the concepts of Yin-Yang theory with meditation, Qigong, and martial training.Joel Robbins is an acupuncturist and board-certified Chinese medicine practitioner, and a certified instructor of Tai Chi, Bagua, and Qigong. (See his listings in the Tai Chi section.)The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2013 Page 108the \"ten thousand things\" (everything in the universe). With such profound implications for all life, it is easy to understand how this concept was given the esteemed title of \"great ultimate.\" The word Chuan (alternately Zhang), meaning \"fist\" or \"boxing,\" is used to denote a martial system. Therefore, Tai Chi Chuan, translating as \"great ultimate boxing,\" is a practice that integrates the concepts of Yin-Yang theory with meditation, Qigong, and martial training. As a result, Tai Chi offers many of the same benefits of Qigong, while also developing applied body mechanics, mental exercise, and self-defense skill. MarTial Training in Tai Chi While hard style martial arts often train to meet force with force (a strike returned with another strike), Tai Chi Chuan practitioners utilize the principles of Yin and Yang, manifested as empty and full, so that when the opponent pushes, there is nothing to push against. And, when he has no push left to give, he becomes unbalanced and can be easily uprooted, as the Tai Chi Classics say, \"using 4 ounces to move 1,000 pounds.\" Partner exercises known as Tui Shou (\"pushing hands\") train sensitivity, rootedness, and softness as means to overcome opposition. Through these martial \"games,\" the Tai Chi practitioner learns practical applications of grand Taoist ideals, such as those expressed in the Tao Te Ching : \"The softest thing in the world overcomes the hardest thing in the world. That which is without form can enter where there is no space. Thus we know the value of non-doing.\" Ba gua Zhang and xing Yi Chuan Less well known, the martial arts Ba Gua Zhang and Xin Yi Chuan also utilize Qigong principles for martial skill. Ba Gua Zhang (\"eight trigram boxing\") is integrated with the principles of change described in the divination text, the I-Ching . This beautiful yet complex art incorporates Taoist circle-walking meditation with martial techniques to create an expressive and fluid system that trains the practitioner to defend against up to eight attackers simultaneously. Xin Yi Chuan (\"mind intent boxing\") is arguably the most martial and linear of all three \"soft\" styles. Direct and forward in its approach, Xin Yi's martial skill is integrated with principles of the Chinese five elements and twelve animals. ConCluSion The \"soft\" martial arts Tai Chi, Ba Gua, and Xin Yi are powerful systems for cultivating health and martial skill that are based on the ancient energy practices of Qigong. Within all of these systems, there are many different styles, each with unique benefits. Those seeking health cultivation alone will do well to explore the various styles of Qigong, while those interested in self-defense also may consider Tai Chi, Ba Gua, and Xin Yi. One's personal predispositions should be taken into account when identifying a suitable style. It is a good idea to visit a few schools to get a feeling for the art form and teaching style. When searching for qualified instruction, it is important to investigate a teacher's training and background, as mastery of these arts can only be cultivated through years of personal practice and exploration.

Written by a Jewish courtier about Christians and Moslems, it also conjures up images of Celtic cauldrons and alchemy. This legend stands at the crossroads of a Western world moving from village to city, from tribe to guild, and follows us into the 21st century from national to global identity. The Grail story foreshadows coming changes in society, science, and religion. Themes of personal and communal healing and transformation are as relevant today as they were five hundred or a thousand years ago. An alchemist who pokes his head through a medieval skyline filled with planets and astrological creatures could find himself in Hollywood. Here, cowboys take the place of knights while TV evangelists supplant monks and mystics. Producers buy the rights to the Wasteland and steal the Fisher King, filling the world with secret societies, and marrying Magdalene to Christ in Dan Brown's The Da Vinci Code . Despite contemporary alterations, the Quest for the Grail is being rediscovered as one of the greatest spiritual classics in the Western world. Meanwhile, I attempt to unravel the mystery of how the Grail journey has managed to occupy a place in my imagination for the better part of thirty years. I was first introduced to the legend at a teacher training course in Steiner education. Through the years feminist friends chastised me for my obsession with what appeared to be a male dominated myth. Yet, I held out until Malcolm Godwin's book, The Holy Grail: Its Origins, Secrets and Meaning Revealed, arrived on the shores of the new world. In his masterpiece, Godwin identifies three wounds infecting Medieval Europe and Western culture to the present day: the Repression of the Feminine, the Creation of the Wasteland, and the Wounding of the Individual Self. I hunger to understand the mystery of the story as it impacts my own life. Everyday there is more evidence of disruption as suburbia advances on my little home in the woods, stomping out native species and family farms. Like my neighbors, I live in fear of job loss, global warming, and corporations running the country. I try to ignore the news about the latest wars somewhere around the world, yet they haunt my dreams. By the time the Grail legend moved from oral tradition to the written word, much of society was in flux. It is easy to see the similarities to our own world today: migrants on the move from rural to urban centers, political and religious institutions rife with corruption, plagues and famines threatening annihilation, and the latest Inquisitor attempting to suppress free thought. Anxiety ruled the day. Yet, just around the corner a parallel universe was carefully hidden away in the memory of Grail followers. In this universe, the Black Madonna reigned in her cathedrals symbolizing a connection of the Divine to the earth and her peoples. Courtly love and romance were preserved in literary epics while many followed the teachings of mystics such as Meister Eckhart, Hildegard of Bingen, and St. Francis of Assisi. Much of the wisdom of Greece, Egypt, and the Arab world would be protected for future generations in manuscripts hidden away in monastery libraries. With such a noble history, it is fitting that the Grail legend is currently being reclaimed for our times. The Grail Story Begins: The W asteland Appears in Childhood The Grail story takes place in the 12th century; it could be the 21st century. Parsival's father and brothers are killed while fighting in the Middle East. Crusaders flow from Avignon to Damascus and Jerusalem, not in search of oil, but trade routes and spice monopolies. An apocalyptic pall settles over the land. Wars scar nature's bounty, destroy villages and families. Parsival's mother hides her son away in a woodland cottage, protecting him from discovery by the war machine. As a boy, Parsival roams the woods around his home. Nature becomes his teacher. It is this relationship to the land that will prove to be his saving grace, providing a connection to his Tree of Life throughout a lifetime filled with challenges. Lured to join the knights in King Arthur's Court, Parsival's mother dresses her young son in a patchwork quilt, the fool's garb, in an attempt to disguise and protect him from the war machine she once escaped. Like others, Parsival will set out in search of the Fisher King whose castle contains the Holy Grail yet whose wound infects his kingdom now referred to as the Wasteland, a place of social, economic, and environmental devastation. Parsival will learn over a lifetime of searching the secrets of a spiritual wisdom that transforms not only his own life but that of the global community. My Story Begins: The W asteland Appears in Childhood I lo ved nature as a child, especially walks in Pitcher Woods with my father who pointed out the dens of small animals and the three types of sassafras leaves. At some point, he would take out his Swiss pocketknife to peel away a bit of the root so that I could exclaim in wonder, \"It smells like root beer.\" I used to love sitting under endpiece Personal Reflections on a Quest for the Grail By Marijo Grogan This legend stands at the crossroads of a Western world moving from village to city, from tribe to guild, and follows us into the 21st century from national to global identity.

Grogan Family Jan. 1959The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2013 Page 113 the great old oak, my personal Tree of Life in our front yard. There I dreamed of riding the roots into the heart of the earth, past places where small animals lived, moles and voles and chipmunks, past the bones of my grandparents and ancient Indians, past layers of topsoil, sand, bedrock, and limestone, past ground water and underground rivers, down to the place of heat, fire, and molten magma. At other times, the great tree lifted me up along its sturdy trunk to branches where I swung out over our small plot of land, or climbed into great cumulous clouds, the wind lapping at my legs and hair. This same breeze blew the curtains of my bedroom on spring mornings. The animals on the curtains swayed and moved in unison, calling out to me to join them in their jungle home, in Eden. I remember sitting on my mother's lap while she read the story of \"The Littlest Angel.\" A Giotto cupid, chubby and pink, floated on the cover against a deep blue sky. He held a cigar box, his souvenir from earth to accompany him throughout eternity, a treasure containing his most valued possessions \u2014 a shell, a pinecone, a feather, and a special stone were among his favorites. I remember how sad this story made me feel even as a child. Heaven's golden paved streets could not compare with the paths through the woods near my home. Even as a child I was aware of the end times. As a family, we said the rosary for the conversion of Russia and checked out bomb shelter units for our basement. When I was six, signs of the Wasteland appeared unexpectedly on a hot summer's night. My parents packed us children into the maroon Pontiac and drove to Northland, the country's first shopping mall. Here we found a family of four living in a sample bomb shelter. The mother prepared dinner from food packets while the father read his newspaper. Above them, like the eye of God, a painting of the Swiss Alps was framed with gingham curtains to provide a homey feeling to their incarcerated existence. The horror of this scenario jolted me awake. Even at six, I knew this story could not be true. It would never be possible to hide from an atomic war and live underground. When I started school not long after this event, my mother was terrified to watch her little girl walk up the hill past Pitcher Woods and disappear at the summit for the final four blocks before arriving at her destination. She dressed me in a red wool coat, not for disguise but for her own recognition, and warned me not to take anything from the men who picked mushrooms in the woods. Finally came the goodbye kiss at the door and a short prayer. My mother sat at the dining room table holding her infant son while she watched my slow progression up the hill past the woods. At other times, she tried to protect me with amulets and prayers like the solemn litanies chanted on Holy Thursday. Heart of Jesus, House of God and Gate of Heaven, King and Center of all Hearts...Holy Mary, Mother of God, Cause of our Joy, Mystical Rose, Tower of Ivory, Morning Star. Rosaries and prayers offered to the saints and angels comprised our greatest shield against the terrors of the world. I grew up surrounded by the stories of saints who loved plants and talked with animals. St. Columba's horse cried in his lap when he knew the old monk was dying. St. Francis saved the wolf of Gubbio from the people and the people from the wolf. St. Therese of the Little Flower sent roses from heaven as a sign of hope. St. Brendan's ship came to rest on the back of a giant whale when he was seeking the Isle of the Saints. In my late teens, I would set aside these stories to follow my own destiny; one I believed, like Parsival, would save the world. Epilogue Of course, this is just the beginning of the Grail story. There are so many more landscapes, twisting plots, and colorful characters to explore. Meanwhile, I attempt to help others interpret the great archetypal wisdom of the Grail for their own lives and times. Together, we take the journey into the deep unconscious where we wrestle with our shadow and uncover the treasure lying at the heart of our psyche and soul. Ultimately, I trust the stories that come from this journey will be the most important for healing our planet and ourselves.
