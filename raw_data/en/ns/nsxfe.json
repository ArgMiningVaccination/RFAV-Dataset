The objectiv es are as follows: T o determine whether protease activity is an independent pro gnostic factor for the healing of venous leg ulcers. B A C K G R O U N D Description of the condition Venous leg ulcers (VLUs) are open skin ulcers (wounds) on the lower leg (from below the ankle up to mid-calf), that can last weeks, months or even years, and are a consequence of problems i n either the supercial or deep veins or both. Damage to the valv es or vein blockages result in malfunctioning of the venous syste m, reducing the efcient return of blood to the heart and increasin g the pressure in the leg veins ( Ghauri 2010 ;Vlajinac 2014 ), which, if prolonged, may result in VLUs. The precise chain of events th at links the high venous pressures with skin breakdown and a chro nic wound is not fully understood ( Coleridge Smith 1988 ;Valencia 2001 ). Leg ulcers are frequently associated with venous incombination with vascular disease, which impairs arterial blo od supply, and such ulcers are said to have a 'mixed aetiology' ( Marston 2011 ). Accurate current estimates of leg ulcer prevalence are hard to ide n- tify because most surveys do not differentiate between causes of leg ulceration, or do so per limb but not per participant ( Moffatt 2004 ;Srinivasaiah 2007 ;Vowden sug- gests that venous ulceration has a point prevalence of 0.29 case s per 1000 in the UK, whilst mixed arterial/venous leg ulcerati on has a point prevalence of 0.11 per 1000 ( Hall 2014 ). A systematic review also reported the point prevalence of leg ulcers in more recent non-UK studies: 0.39 per 1000 in New Zealand in 2004, 1.4 per 1000 in Portugal in 2005, and 2.4 per 1000 in Sweden in 2008 ( Cullum 2016 ). Venous disease is a chronic condition characterised by periods o f 1 Protease activity as a prognostic factor for wound healing i n venous leg ulcers (Protocol) Copyright \u00a9 2017 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.ulceration (i.e. an open wound) followed by healing and then recurrence, though published contemporary data are lacking: an early cross-sectional study reported that half of current or rece nt ulcers had been open for up to nine months and that 35% of people with leg ulcers had experienced four or more episodes ( Callam 1987 ). This picture was supported by a subsequent cross-sectional study ( Nelz\u00e9n 1994 ). There are many prognostic factors for healing: we reviewed coh ort data from 13 studies in people with VLUs ( Ashby 2014 ;Barwell 2000 results sug- gested that, in multivariable analyses, smaller initial wo und area and shorter duration of ulcer were independently associated w ith healing (over 24 weeks of follow-up or more); and younger age, a smaller number of wounds, mobility (especially ankle) and low er weight (or body mass index (BMI)) may also be important factors for healing. The rst-line treatment for VLUs is compression therapy in the form of bandages, stockings or mechanical devices ( O'Meara 2012 ). This application of external pressure around the lower leg assists venous return and reduces the pooling of blood in the legs (venous reflux) ( Fletcher 2013 ;O'Meara 2012 ). Along- side compression, dressings are almost always to ope n ul- cers ( O'Meara 2014 ). Other treatments for venous surgery (removal of incompetent supercial veins) ( SIGN 2010 ), and drugs such as pentoxifylline ( Jull 2012 ). Leg ulcers are associated with considerable cost to patients and to healthcare providers. T wo systematic reviews summarised the literature on health -re- lated quality of life in patients with leg ulcers ( Herber 2007 ; Persoon 2004 ). Both included qualitative and quantitative eval- uations, and reported that presence of leg ulceration was asso ci- ated with pain, restriction of work and leisure activities, im paired mobility, sleep disturbance, reduced psychological well-being and social isolation. Ulcers can be painful, malodorous, prone to i n- fection, and may severely affect people's mobility and qualit y of life (Dumville 2009 ;Herber 2007 ). In severe cases, ulceration can lead to limb amputation, though this is more likely in patien ts who also have arterial insufciency ( Dumville 2009 ;Nelz\u00e9n 2008 ; Valencia 2001 ), or even to a type of cancer known as 'Marjolin's ul- cer' ( Choa 2015 ). Recent research suggests that people with com- plex wounds, including those with VLUs, commonly see complete ulcer healing as the most important outcome to them ( Madden 2014 ). The nancial cost of treating a person with an open VLU in the UK has been estimated at around GBP 1700 per year at 2012 prices. A large part of ulcer treatment cost comprises nursing ti me (Ashby 2014 ). Another evaluation estimated the average cost of treating a person with a VLU in Sweden as between EUR 1332 and EUR 2585 (based on costs for material for dressing changes) and in the UK as between EUR 814 and EUR 1994 (price year2002), with higher costs associated with larger and more chronic wounds ( Ragnarson T ennvall 2005 ). Data from a German study, which estimated total costs including those classied as indire ct or intangible costs, estimated mean annual costs of treating l eg ulcers as EUR 9060 per patient (2006 prices). This gure is higher than other estimates because it includes non-health service cost s to the patient and to society ( Augustin 2012 ). A recent Australian cost-effectiveness study estimated the mean cost per person per week for treating 905 people with a chronic leg or foot ulcer be- low the knee for 24 weeks as AUD 53.31 (which corresponds to AUD 2772 per year); costs included consultations with healthcare professionals, compression bandaging, other dressings and treat- ments, and community care services, such as Meals-on-Wheels and home help ( Graves 2014 ). Evidence shows that not all VLUs heal, even under trial condi- tions: a large study in 453 participants showed that about 30% of VLUs did not heal following rst-line treatment with compre s- sion therapy over 12 months ( Ashby 2014 ). There is interest in additional treatments that may improve wound healing, and o ne dressing option is the use of protease-modulating dressings , which are suggested to reduce the activity of a group of enzymes known as proteases. As discussed below, it is thought that prolonged a nd ele- vated activity of proteases may be a feature of non-healing wou nds, such that appropriate use of protease-modulating dressings co uld promote healing. However, evidence for the effectiveness of t hese dressings in VLUs is largely unclear ( Westby 2016 ). Such dressings are a new development in wound care in that they are intended to be a 'targeted' treatment aimed at wounds with high protea se activity. In this context, protease activity dictates subseque nt treat- ment, but there is limited evidence supporting the use of a tes t- and-treat approach ( Norman 2016 ). In fact, the prognostic nature of protease levels in relation to wound healing is unclear and this will be the focus of this Cochrane Review. Description of the prognostic factor A prognostic factor is any measure that, among people with a gi ven health condition, is associated with a future clinical outcome; f or example, in people with a VLU, lower BMI may be associated with less time to healing. The prognostic factor for this revi ew is a biomarker, protease activity, which is sometimes elevate d in open wounds. Biomarkers have been dened by the National In- stitutes of Health Biomarkers Denitions Working Group (199 9) to be \"a characteristic that is objectively measured and evalua ted as an indicator of normal biological processes, pathogenic pro - cesses, or pharmacologic responses to a therapeutic interven tion\". Biomarkers are medical signs, as opposed to medical symptoms (which are indications of health or illness perceived by patient s themselves) ( Strimbu 2010 ). Biomarkers may predict health out- comes, but not necessarily. However, there are still no accepted denitive biomarkers for making assessments of chronic woun ds (Patel 2016 ;Yager 2007 ). 2 Protease activity as a prognostic factor for wound healing i n venous leg ulcers (Protocol) Copyright \u00a9 2017 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.One possible biomarker type that has received some attention for wounds are the proteases, which are enzymes that break down pr o- teins into peptides and amino acids ( Zhang 2012 ); in general, the various wound-related proteases break down different prote ins. The principal proteases involved in the wound healing process are the matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and the serine proteas es, which break down extracellular matrix (ECM) and connective tis- sue proteins such ;Ladwig 2002 2009 ). This pro- tein breakdown is thought to be important in the early stages of the healing process because it aids removal of unwanted materi al and bacteria. However, in the later stages of wound healing, p ro- tein breakdown is believed to be undesirable because the prot eases damage newly-formed tissue, preventing completion of healin g (McCarty 2013 ;Velnar 2009 ). Proteases are produced by an inflammatory process, which also inhibits the synthesis of chemicals that inhibit the action of m etal- loproteinases (Tissue Inhibitors of MetalloProteinases - TIMPs). Some studies have measured the ratio of MMPs and TIMPs as a biomarker ( McCarty 2013 ;Muller 2008 ), and it may be more valuable to consider the balance of proteases and their inhibi tors MMPs have been divided into six subtypes on the basis of the su b- strates they work on and their domain structure (chemical com- ponents) ( Lazaro 2016 biomarkers include modular proteins that comb ine proteases with other biological species: for example, the fam ilies of A Disintegrin And Metalloproteinase (ADAMs) ( Duffy ; Edwards 2008 with ThromboSpondin motifs Kelwick 2015 ). Chronic wounds also contain proteases associated with several types o f bac- teria ( McCarty 2012 ;McCarty ; Suleman 2016 ). Protease activity can be measured in wound fluid using various b io- chemical tests. Laboratory-based scientic studies have used s ev- eral different techniques, approaches that primari ly de- tect MMP-2 and MMP-9 (gelatin zymography), and methods that enzyme activity using either chemical (e.g. quenched fluo- rescence ,McCarty ). A range of methods of ob- taining wound fluid have been used and these vary with the type of protease measured ( Cullen 2006 ;Quirk 2003 ;T rengove 2007 ). There is also a commercial colorimetric indicator available, which is said to determine protease activity, givi ng a colour change if activity is elevated above a threshold; a weigh ted average of the activity of various proteases is used ( Gibson 2014 ; NICE 2016 ). How the prognostic factor may be related to health outcomes It has been suggested that, in chronic ulcers generally, non-he aling may be associated with a prolonged high activity of proteases i n the wound in the later stages of the wound healing process ( Harding 2011 ;Hart 2002 ;McCarty 2013 ;Palolahti 1993 ). Proteases are active in all phases of wound healing (haemostas is, inflammation, proliferation and remodelling) and are there fore thought to have a number of roles in the normal wound healing process ( Patel 2016 ;T rengove 1999 ;Velnar 2009 ). It is thought that there is a burst of protease activity at the start of acute w ound healing, and that in normally healing wounds, the activity pe aks in the rst few days and then declines to very low levels by one week, as healing progresses ( Harding 2011 ;Nwomeh 1998 ). In non-healing wounds, however, it is thought that high prote ase activity may arise through two main routes (involving differe nt types of proteases): relating to both the host cells (human) and to bacteria in the wound. It is thought that the two types of prote ase activity may reinforce each other (have a synergistic mechanism) (McCarty 2012 ;McCarty 2013 ;Percival 2012 ;Sibbald 2007 ; Suleman 2016 ). In the host, complex inflammatory mechanisms may result in proteases reaching higher levels and persistin g for longer than in normally healing wounds ( McCarty 2013 ;T rengove 1999 ). As previously noted, this persistent breakdown of protein s (proteolytic activity) is thought to damage newly formed tiss ue and to degrade growth factors, leading to non-healing wounds (Cullen 2002 ;Harding 2011 ;Wlaschek 1997 ;Yager 1997 ). Most chronic wounds are colonised with bacteria, though not necessar - ily infected. Bacterial proliferation and their formation in to lm- like material (biolms) in non-healing wounds has been linked to early chronic inflammation and then elevated protease leve ls. Infection refers to invasion of tissue by bacteria and extends the inflammatory response and tissue damage ( Percival 2012 ;Pugliese 2016 ;Sibbald 2007 ;Suleman 2016 ). Limited evidence suggests correlations between elevated lev els of MMPs and delayed healing in people with pressure ulcers ( Ladwig 2002 ), or in foot ulcers of people with diabetes ( Liu 2009 ), as well as in people with VLUs ( Mwaura 2006 ;Serra 2013 ). This may be a property of wounds more generally, but differences betwe en wound types have also been observed ( Lazaro 2016 ;McCarty 2013 ). For VLUs in particular, studies of protease activity in wound fl uid have suggested that there are signicantly higher levels of p roteases in ulcer tissue compared with healthy tissue, and that these le vels decrease following compression treatment in wounds that heal 3 Protease activity as a prognostic factor for wound healing i n venous leg ulcers (Protocol) Copyright \u00a9 2017 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.(Beidler 2008 ); other studies have reported higher levels in chronic wounds compared with acute wounds ( Lazaro 2016 ;T rengove 1999 ;Wysocki between protease activity and non-heali ng is not clear cut. Limited data from two industry-sponsored studie s respectively found that only 28% of 162 ( Serena 2011 ) and 23% of ( Gibson non-healing wounds of mixed aetiology had high protease activity; one of these studies reported that 22 % of 101 leg ulcers had elevated protease activity ( Gibson 2013 ). Wound fluid is a useful source of biomarkers, and its compositio n is broadly assumed to reflect the current clinical condition of a wound ( L\u00f6ffler 2013 ). Wound fluid can be obtained in a largely non-invasive way, but in order to give reproducible and accurate measurement of biomarkers, the wound fluid has to be collected and processed reliably. There are several techniques for woun d fluid sampling, including the use of occlusive dressings, entra p- ment of fluid in dressings, swabs, other techniques and devices . The duration of fluid collection can also be important ( L\u00f6ffler 2013 ). Importance of evidence about prognostic factors Biomarkers of this type may potentially be implicated in, or m e- diate, particular pathways to non-healing. Studying the prog no- with biomarkers has a two-fold purpose: rstly , it can help us understand mechanisms related to healing, includ- ing investigating the true causes of non-healing. Secondly, it can allow identication of wounds at increased risk of non-healing , which could allow selective treatment of these wounds according to the specic biomarker type and level. Targetted treatment of this type (the 'test-and-treat' approach) is important, especia lly if treatments are costly or have adverse effects, so that they are not used where they will not be effective. It is likely that there i s more than one pathway to non-healing and other pathways will prob- ably be represented by other biomarkers. The best approach ma y be to determine a set of biomarkers and treat according to their levels. A commercial test for protease activity is now available ( Gibson 2014 ), and is intended for use at the point of care, in con- junction with protease-modulating treatments ( Barrett 2011 ; Harding 2011 ;Snyder 2011 ;Snyder 2013 ). This approach has mainly found application in diabetic foot ulcers ( NICE 2016 ). A Cochrane Review on test-and-treat for healing in VLUs did not identify any studies ( Norman 2016 ). Why it is important to do this review? VLUs are a relatively common type of complex wound that have a negative impact on people's lives and incur high costs for heal th services and society. Leg ulcers are painful, sometimes malodo rous, prone to infection, and may severely affect patients' mobilit y andquality of life; in severe cases, there is a risk of limb amputa tion. There are a number of treatments for VLUs, but many ulcers prov e hard to heal. T wo recent Cochrane Reviews investigated protease-modulatin g matrix (PMM) dressings, but did not nd evidence on protease activity: Westby 2016 examined the effects of PMM dressings for healing VLUs, and found it was unclear whether PMM dressings increased the probability of healing at 12 weeks, in compariso n with non-PMM dressings (RR 1.28, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.71; 4 tri- als, 192 participants). The study populations typically compri sed people with hard-to-heal wounds, but the level of protease was re- ported only in one study. A second review searched for evidence o n 'test-and-treat' approaches for healing VLUs; for example, PM M treatment given selectively to wounds with elevated proteas e activ- ity (Norman 2016 ). No studies were found. The current review is the third part of this set of Cochrane Reviews on protease activ ity- related treatment. It is important to investigate whether elevated protease act ivity is a prognostic factor for healing. For practical use, the biomark er should be robust to adjustment for other factors such as age. Th is Cochrane Review is mainly exploratory in nature and its focus is on protease activity in general; it will not address associa tions of specic proteases, although we will report the actual prote ases measured. A recent literature review summarised clinical evidence on MMPs in chronic wound healing ( Lazaro 2016 ). The authors reported studies that found correlations between MMP levels and vario us measures of healing, but did not give full quantitative data . They identied some studies investigating MMP thresholds for he aling but these were in people with diabetic foot ulcers. The review did not examine the literature on proteases other than MMPs. O B J E C T I V E S T o determine whether protease activity is an independent pro g- nostic factor for the healing of venous leg ulcers. M E T H O D S At the outset, we note that the methods used in this review hav e two underlying assumptions: rstly, that biomarkers are repre sentative of wound processes and can be used to monitor wound healing. Secondly, that the removal of wound fluid does not interfere wi th the healing processes ( Yager 2007 ). It is unclear how robust these assumptions are. Criteria for considering studies for this review 4 Protease activity as a prognostic factor for wound healing i n venous leg ulcers (Protocol) Copyright \u00a9 2017 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.T ypes of study designs We will include reports of prospective and retrospective longi tu- dinal studies that investigate whether the prognostic facto r, pro- tease activity, is associated with healing of VLUs. We will not in- clude studies that examine prediction models. We will include RCTs analysed as cohort studies, provided interventions are taken into account in the analysis. We will include case-control studies if there are no cohort studies for each type of protease. We will not include cross-sectional studies or case reports. We will inclu de studies with any follow-up period. We will consider evidence separately within the different pha ses of prognostic factor investigation: Phase 1 (exploratory), and P hase 2 (conrmatory) studies, which provide different levels of evid ence (Hayden 2008 ). Exploratory studies identify associations of many potential prognostic factors and outcomes. These studies mea sure associations between single factors and the outcome, ('univari able' or 'univariate' associations) and provide the least conclusiv e infor- mation regarding the independence of a variable as a valid pro g- nostic factor. Conrmatory studies aim to measure the indepe n- dent effect of a prognostic factor on the relevant outcome while controlling for other factors. We will include all eligible stu dies in the review but, if possible, we will restrict the results summ ary and any meta-analyses to results from multivariable analyses. F ailing this, we will include the results of univariable analyses and will take account of the phase of investigation in the 'Risk of bias' as- sessment and GRADE rating. T ypes of participants We will include studies that include people with a VLU, who are managed in any care setting. We expect the method of diagnosis of venous ulceration to vary, so we will accept denitions as use d in the included studies. We will include studies in people with VLUs, alongside people with other types of wounds (e.g. arterial ulcers, pressure ulcers, d iabetic foot ulcers), provided the results for people with venous ulcer s are presented separately, or if most participants (at least 75%) h ad leg ulcers of venous aetiology. Where wounds are described only as leg ulcers without information as to aetiology, we will assum e they are venous in origin because this is the most common type of leg ulcer. We will include studies that involve participants at any stage in their treatment pathway, and we will record, where available , base- line data on the time since diagnosis and treatments previous ly given, together with ongoing treatments. We will include stu dies that involve participants with any infection status at baseli ne: we will record any available data on this. We will exclude studies conducted solely in vitro and animal stu d- ies. T ypes of prognostic factors: dening protease activityThe prognostic protease Any type of pr otease or combination of proteases will be eligible, either from the host or from including: species: ADAM; ADAMTS. Where possible, we will combine these three major categories in the analyses, taking into consideration cut-off points used (se e 'Data synthesis' section below). We will also include and report separately studies that inves tigate as biomarkers the ratio of proteases and ibitors, e.g. MMP-2 (protease) and TIMP-2 (inhibitor). The prognostic factor may be examined as a continuous or cate- gorical variable and any cut-off point will be permitted. We will permit any approach to obtaining samples from wounds, and any method of measurement of protease activity. We will no t include measures of proteases in the blood. We will report all unadjusted (simple) and adjusted (multivar iable) associations between the prognostic factor and healing, with details on any adjustment factors used. T ypes of outcome measures Primary outcome measures We will include the following primary outcome measures: time to healing (survival analysis); the proportion of people with ulcers completely healed, at any follow-up duration. We will consider subgroup analyses to explore the impact of fol - low-up time. We will accept study authors' denitions of what constitutes a healed wound. We will record study-reported associations. Binary outcomes wi ll preferably be reported as time-to-event measures (survival), b ut failing that, we will consider dichotomous summary data at the longest time point or the time point specied in the study's me th- ods section. Secondary outcome measures Change in size of ulcer/rate of wound closure (e.g. cm\u00b2/ day). 5 Protease activity as a prognostic factor for wound healing i n venous leg ulcers (Protocol) Copyright \u00a9 2017 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.If there are no ulcer healing data for a particular association, we will use data on the change (and percentage change) in ulcer size, with adjustment for baseline size (contacting study authors to requ est adjusted means when not presented). Where change in ulcer size is reported without adjustment for baseline size, we will do cument the use of the outcome in the study, but we will not extract or summarise data or use it in any meta-analysis. For continuous outcomes, we will report either continuous sum- mary data or dichotomous data with any cut-off point. Search methods for identication of studies We will search the following databases: Ovid MEDLINE (1946 to date); Ovid Embase (1974 to date); CINAHL (1982 to date); Cochrane Central Register of Controlled T rials (CENTRAL) (most recent issue). The draft search strategy for MEDLINE is in Appendix 2 . In addition we will search the bibliographies of all included s tudies and of identied relevant systematic reviews. Data collection and analysis Study selection T wo review authors will independently assess the titles and ab- stracts of retrieved records against the inclusion criteria. We will obtain all potentially relevant studies in full and two revi ew au- thors will independently assess these for eligibility. We w ill resolve any disagreements at each stage through discussion and, where appropriate, we will consult a third review author. Where ther e is doubt over the eligibility of a study, we will attempt to conta ct the study authors in order to resolve the uncertainty. Where studi es are reported in multiple publications/reports, we will obtain a ll publi- cations. Whilst we will include a study only once in the review, we will extract data from all reports to ensure we obtain all avai lable relevant data. The study selection process will be illustrate d in a PRISMA diagram. All studies excluded after full-text assessm ent will be listed in a 'Characteristics of excluded studies' table with their reasons for exclusion. Data extraction and management We will collect all associations reported between the prognost ic factor and outcomes, with details on any adjustment factors use d. We will extract and record data from included studies using a dat a extraction sheet. One review author will extract data, which wi ll then be checked by a second review author. If key data are missing from reports we will attempt to contact the study authors.We will extract the following data for the pre-specied prognos tic factors and outcomes in this review. We will collect outcome data as described in the 'Types of outcome measures' section. We will extract the following data: country and setting in which study was conducted; study design; eligibility criteria; participant details; ulcer details, including of ulcer, ulcer size, number of ulcers and ulcer history, and ulcer severity (with the system used to classify this) as reported by the study authors; treatment details, including compression and debridement (including type and frequency); method of obtaining wound fluid for prognostic factor measurement, including duration of collection; method of measurement of protease activity (e.g. Gelatin zymography); details of each prognostic factor: type of protease/ combination of factors, measurement of prognostic factor, typ e of data (e.g. continuous/any cut-off points and if so, whether they were pre-dened and what the justication was for that cut- off point); details of each outcome: measurement, type of data (e.g. continuous/any cut-off points); duration of follow-up; type of analysis: e.g. explanatory/conrmatory (including the presence of a pre-dened protocol and study registration); logistic regression/Cox regression; any adjustment factors considered in the analysis; association statistics for each prognostic factor for primary and secondary outcomes (e.g. odds ratios (ORs), hazard ratios (HRs) and their condence intervals (CIs)/variances/standard errors); loss to follow-up, and reasons. Assessment of risk of bias in included studies T wo review authors will independently appraise the included stud- ies using a standardised approach. In the case of discrepancies, the review authors will attempt to reach consensus; if necessary a t hird review author will resolve any disagreements. The review au thors will not be blinded to study authors, institution or journal of pub- lication due to feasibility. We will assess risk of bias using an approach based on the Quali ty In Prognosis Studies (QUIPS) tool, which is appropriate for prog nos- tic factor review questions ( Hayden 2013 ;Hayden 2014 ). Our ap- proach also draws on the ROBINS I tool ( ROBINS-I 2017 ) which assesses the risk non-randomised intervention st udies (Sterne 2016 ). We have provided further details in Appendix 3 . This approach assesses risk of bias per study for each prognost ic factor-outcome combination, by considering six domains: study participation (selection bias), study attrition, prognostic f actor 6 Protease activity as a prognostic factor for wound healing i n venous leg ulcers (Protocol) Copyright \u00a9 2017 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.measurement, outcome measurement, adjustment, and statist ical analysis and reporting. Each domain is rated as having high, m od- erate or low risk of bias. We will dene an all-domain risk of bi as per study for each prognostic factor-outcome combination, takin g into account all of the above domains, but especially focusing on the key domains of selection bias, study attrition, adjustme nt, and statistical analysis and reporting. As a guide, we will assig n risk of bias as follows: low risk of bias if all (or all key) domains h ave low risk of bias; moderate risk of bias if there is high risk of bias for one key domain or moderate risk of bias for at least two key domains (with the rest as low risk of bias); high risk of bias if t here is high risk of bias for at least two key domains. We will perfo rm sensitivity analysis considering only studies at low all-dom ain risk of bias ( Hayden 2013 ). Measures of association We will extract all unadjusted and adjusted measures of associ a- tion from included studies and convert effect sizes, as necessar y, in order to avoid possible selection bias, thus allowing us to us e data from as many studies as possible. HRs are the preferred measu re of the relationship between individual prognostic factors and healing outcomes, and we will separately extract and analyse HRs for st ud- ies providing this measure of association. However, we antici pate that results will also be reported as ORs and RRs; we will use O Rs as the common measure of the association, and RRs and HRs to estimate ORs at a particular time point ( Symons 2002 ). For consistency, we will re-calculate associations to be in the sam e direction, as necessary, with associations above 1 indicating b etter prognosis for positive binary outcomes (e.g. a healed wound). W e will appropriately transform the individual study associat ions (e.g. ORs) and their 95% condence limits to their natural logarithm s to normalise their distributions and then will calculate the s tandard error. We will contact study authors regarding missing or unus able data, as necessary. Where the outcomes are reported as continuous measures (e.g. change in ulcer size), we will analyse the regression coefcients with their standard errors. If we cannot obtain OR values from the published papers or from the study authors, we will report correlation coefcients or an y other measure of association. Unit of analysis issues The prognostic factor (protease activity) and outcome (complete wound healing) are both considered at the ulcer level. A possib le unit of analysis issue could arise when there is more than one u lcer per person and multivariable analysis has been conducted with adjustment factors measured at the individual level (e.g. pat ient age). This represents clustered data and analyses should be con - ducted using hierarchical methods. Where studies include clus- tered data of this type we will report this, noting whether da ta areanalysed correctly. We will record this as part of the 'Risk of bi as' assessment. We will consider including such studies in any meta - analysis, taking into account the associated risk of bias. Dealing with missing data We will include studies that investigate the relationship be tween protease activity and healing regardless of whether or not th ere are missing data and even if limited evidence is provided abou t the size of the effect (for example, if the factor is mentioned on ly as being 'non-signicant' in the analyses). If necessary, we wil l contact study authors for clarication and to attempt to retriev e any missing information. Assessment of heterogeneity We will consider the clinical heterogeneity of included studies based on the population, measure of the prognostic factor, cut - off points used, outcome measurement and methodological het- erogeneity due to study design/potential biases. We nthesise associations as appropriate within clinically-relevant subgr oups, grouping studies regardless of type of protease, duration o f ulcer and presence of infection. We will examine the latter two featu res in subgroup analyses where there is heterogeneity. Reporting bias We will examine publication bias for each meta-analysis, provi ded there are 10 or more studies, by visually examining asymmetr y on funnel plots and testing for asymmetry at the 10% level, usin g Egger's test for HRs, and Peters' test for ORs ( Sterne 2011 ). Data synthesis Synthesising data in prognostic factor studies requires us t o recog- nise the many different ways of reporting and analysing resu lts, and, where possible, to request alternative data or to trans form results to a common format (see 'Measures of association' sectio n). We will consider the impact of data transformations using sens i- tivity analyses. We expect that most studies will measure and present data abou t prognostic factors for the healing of VLUs, such that the outcom e variable is analysed as dichotomous data, but the prognostic factor may be reported as continuous data (e.g. protease activity) or v alues may be dichotomised with different cut-off points or there may be more than two categorical levels to the prognostic factor. After carrying out any appropriate transformations, where p ossible we will group together studies with similar prognostic facto r cut- off points/similar analytical approaches, and will represen t results for different analytical approaches as subgroups on a forest p lot for that prognostic factor-outcome combination, even if we do not conduct a meta-analysis. Where possible and appropriate, we wil l 7 Protease activity as a prognostic factor for wound healing i n venous leg ulcers (Protocol) Copyright \u00a9 2017 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.conduct meta-analyses. We will include in the forest plots detai ls of any adjustment factors considered in the study analyses. We will conduct meta-analysis if valid data are available asses s- ing associations between individual prognostic factors and a n out- come of interest for sufciently homogeneous subgroups of stu d- ies. We will dene 'sufciently homogeneous' subgroups accord - ing to population, measures of the prognostic factor and outco me measurement. For prognostic factors that are analysed as continuous measur es, we will combine the data for all proteases, regardless of the s ource or type of protease; for prognostic factors analysed as dichot o- mous measures, we will take cut-off points into consideration a s described above. We will analyse separately ratios of protea ses and their inhibitors. We will conduct separate meta-analyses of HRs and ORs (at similar follow-up points), and will also transform the measures, wher e possible, so that one analysis (OR) can be conducted. We will conduct meta-regression analysis if there are more than 10 stud ies providing sufcient data. We will conduct meta-analyses using STATA (StataCorp version 14) with a random-effects restricted maximum likelihood (REML) meta-analysis model, which accounts for any between-study het- erogeneity prognostic effect ( Such hetero- geneity is common in prognostic factor studies. Unless the het ero- geneity (as assessed above) is too extensive for appropriate pool- ing, we will summarise the meta-analysis by the pooled estima te (the average prognostic factor effect), its Hartung-Knapp 95% CI , 95% predic- tion interval for the prognostic effect in a single populatio n (Riley 2011 ). 'Summary of ndings' table and GRADE assessment We will use an approach modied from the GRADE framework (Guyatt 2011a ) to assess the overall quality (certainty) of evidence for each prognostic factor-outcome combination ( Hayden 2014; Iorio 2015 ). We will rate the overall strength of evidence as ei- ther 'high', 'moderate', 'low' or 'very low' considering prognostic study (conrmatory/explanatory or exploratory), the within-study risk of bias, the directness of evidence, heterog ene- ity, precision of effect estimates and risk of publication bias (Iorio 2015; Sch\u00fcnemann 2011b ). We will also consider two 'upgrading' factors - large effect and dose effect - although we note that hig h risk of bias may articially lead to large effects (see Appendix 4 for further details). We will present the main results of the review in 'Summary of ndings' tables. These tables present key information concer ning the certainty of the evidence, the magnitude of the association s examined, and the sum of the available data ( Sch\u00fcnemann 2011a ). 'Summary of ndings' tables also include an overall grading o f the evidence. This denes the certainty of a body of evidence as theextent to which one can be condent that an estimate of effect or association is close to the true quantity of specic interest. We will present evidence for the various prognostic factors in rows in 'Summary of ndings' tables. If it is not appropriate to combine results using meta-analysi s (too much clinical heterogeneity), we will present the results quali ta- tively, considering the strength and consistency of results us ing the following schema: strong evidence of effect: consistent ndings (dened as > 75% of studies showing the same direction of effect) in multipl e low risk of bias studies; moderate evidence of effect: consistent ndings in multiple high risk of bias and/or one study with low risk of bias; limited evidence of effect: one study available; conflicting evidence of effect: inconsistent ndings across studies; no effect: no association between patient expectations and the outcome of interest. We will calculate absolute risk differences for the effect of the prognostic factor using estimates of baseline risk from the l iterature where possible. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses We will use sensitivity analyses to explore the impact of stud y all- domain risk of bias, rstly restricting the analysis to studi es rated as having low risk of bias, and if this is not feasible, restri cting to low or moderate risk of bias. If there is heterogeneity, we will investigate it using the f ollowing pre-specied subgroup analyses, provided there are at least t wo studies per subgroup: baseline duration of ulcer (up to 24 weeks; 24 weeks); duration may be a proxy for a non-healing wound, in which protease activity may be associated differently with healing ; presence or absence of infection. We will not conduct subgroup analyses by type of protease becaus e this would introduce too high a level of complexity for this rev iew, but will record the type of protease measured. We will consider subgroup or sensitivity analyses to explore the impact of types of measurement approaches for assessing progn os- tic factors.

Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.A P P E N D I C E S Appendix 1. Key prognostic factors and key adjustment factors f or VLU healing 1.1. Prognostic factors We identied 13 cohort studies that examined prognostic facto rs for VLU healing at 24 or 52 weeks follow-up and reported resu lts of multivariable analyses 2010 ;Scotton 2014 ). Other than multivariable analysis and the study design, we did not assess the study quality. The prognostic factors in vestigated were as follows: patient characteristics: age (ve studies), gender (six studies), weight/BMI (two studies), ethnicity (one study); comorbidities: angina (one study), myocardial infarction (one st udy), hypertension (one study), cerebrovascular accident (one study), deep vein thrombosis (three studies), diabetes mellit us (two studies), thyroid disease (one study), rheumatoid arthr itis (one study); mobility: mobility (three studies), ankle studi es), hip/knee replacement surgery (one study); ulcer characteristics: wound duration (six studies), wound area (s even studies), depth of VLU (one study), grade of VLU (one study), number of ulcers (two studies), number of previous ulcer e pisodes (one study), wound covered with brin (two studies), wound covered with eschar (one study), wound debrided surgically (two studies), chronicity (two studies); limb characteristics: ankle brachial pressure index (one study), lipodermatosclerosis (one study), calf/ankle circumference rati o (one study), venous ligation/stripping (one study), venous refl ux of various types and levels (one study); Infection (one study), bacterial bioburden (two studies); other: public assistance/self pay healthcare (one study); interventions: two studies. These results are represented on forest plots to determine t rends for prognostic factors with more than two studies or sho wing dose effects in the Figures section ( Figure 1 ;Figure 2 ;Figure 3 ;Figure 4 Figure 5 ;Figure 6 ). From these results we identied likely important prognostic factors and possibly important prognostic factor s, by taking into account consistency and dose effects. 14 Protease activity as a prognostic factor for wound healing i n venous leg ulcers (Protocol) Copyright \u00a9 2017 The Cochrane Collaboration.

Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.Figure 6. Prognostic factors for VLU healing: bacteria and i nfection Likely important prognostic factors for healing: smaller wo und area (or lower grade or depth of ulcer), shorter duration of u lcer; possible important prognostic factors for healing: younger age, smaller number of wounds, ankle flexion (with individual mobility as a possible surrogate) and lower weight (or BMI); the evidence from three studies ( Lantis 2013 ;Moffatt 2004 ;Scotton 2014 ) on the prognostic value of bacterial species in wounds appears to be contradictory ( Figure 6 ) and there may be confounding effects from treatment. However , infection itself is likely to be a prognostic factor for a lack of healing/delayed h ealing. Key adjustment factors In order to accurately determine the association between a prog nostic factor and the outcome, it is important to adjust for key factors that will distort that relationship. Key adjustment factors should be statistically associated with both the outcome and th e prognostic factor, and should not lie on a direct pathway between the progn ostic factor and the outcome. We planned to determine key adjustment factors for healing by investigating whether each of the key prognostic factors (KPFs ) were associated (in a univariable analysis) with protease activity , on the basis of the evidence - ensuring that the adjustment fa ctor was unlikely to be on the direct pathway. If we identied an association of th e KPF with protease activity, we termed the KPF a 'key adjustme nt factor'. We also discussed possible key adjustment factors wit h clinicians. In practice, the evidence was limited. There was some evidence th at age could affect protease activity and may therefore be a key adjustment factor ( Ashcroft 1997 ). Additionally, we considered infection likely to be a key adju stment factor, but we were unclear regarding the other KPFs. We tentatively dened two key adju stment factors a priori (age and infection), but recognised that w e may have missed important factors. Therefore, if additional adj ustment factors appear in analyses from several studies, we w ill consider adding these to the set of key factors and reassessing the risk of bias for all the studies. We will report and compare any adjusting factors used in the stu dies, and will examine whether there are differences between adjusted and unadjusted analyses. 19 Protease activity as a prognostic factor for wound healing i n venous leg ulcers (Protocol) Copyright \u00a9 2017 The Cochrane Collaboration.

Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.Appendix 3. Quality In Prognosis Studies (QUIPS): risk of bias a ssessment, modied for this review We will assess risk of bias for each study for each prognostic fa ctor-outcome combination, considering each of six domains. Domain 1. Study participation This domain assesses whether the study sample is representa tive of the population of interest (source population). Low risk of bias The relationship between the prognostic factor and the outcom e is unlikely to be different for participating individuals a nd eligible non-participating individuals. We will make an assignment of low risk of bias if all the following requirements are met: the study sample is consecutively or randomly recruited from th e target population or, for case control studies, the cases and controls are from similar populations; participants are representative of the review population of interest: people with venous leg ulcers; study follow-up is adequate for healing to occur and reverse caus ation to be avoided - a minimum of two months follow-up; participants are not different from eligible non-participant s in terms of the key prognostic factors ( Appendix 1 ); the participation rate is high - review authors' judgement. High risk of bias The relationship between the prognostic factor and the outcom e is very likely to be different for participating individual s and eligible non-participating individuals. We note that prognostic stud ies based on data from randomised trial evidence will often ha ve selected patients and we will consider the RCT inclusion criteria, as app ropriate ( Iorio 2015 ). We will make an assignment of high risk of bias if any of the following statements apply and we consider there is a likely high risk of bias as a consequence: the sample is selectively recruited. For case control studies, ca ses and controls are not from similar source populations; participants are not representative of the review populatio n of interest: participants have very different characteristics from eligibl e non-participants in terms of the key prognostic factors; study follow-up is inadequate for events to occur and/or revers e causation is possible (less than 2 months); the participation rate is low. Moderate risk of bias The relationship between the prognostic factor and the outcom e may be different for participating individuals and eligibl e non- participating individuals, but there is insufcient informa tion to make a judgement of low or high risk of bias, or we are un certain whether the quality issue is likely to lead to high risk of bia s. Domain 2. Study attrition The study attrition domain addresses whether participants co mpleting the study (i.e. with follow-up data) represent the ba seline sample. Low risk of bias The relationship between the prognostic factor and the outcom e is unlikely to be different for completing and non-completing participants. We will make an assignment of low risk of bias if any one of the following is true: no missing outcome data or adequate response rate; reasons for missing outcome data are unlikely to be related to true outcome (for survival data, censoring is unlikely to be introducing bias), e.g. missing at random; missing outcome data are balanced in numbers across categorical p rognostic groups, with similar reasons for missing data acro ss groups in terms of the key prognostic factors; missing data have been imputed using appropriate methods. 22 Protease activity as a prognostic factor for wound healing i n venous leg ulcers (Protocol) Copyright \u00a9 2017 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.High risk of bias The relationship between the prognostic factor and the outcom e is very likely to be different for completing and non-completi ng participants. We will make an assignment of high risk of bias i f any of the following statements apply and we consider there i s a likely high risk of bias as a consequence: reasons for missing data are likely to be related to the true o utcome or the prognostic factor, with either imbalance in numbe rs or reasons for missing data across categorical prognostic groups in terms of the key prognostic factors; high levels of missing data; potentially inappropriate application of simple imputatio n. Moderate risk of bias The relationship between the prognostic factor and the outcom e may be different for completing and non-completing participan ts, but there is insufcient information to make a judgement of lo w or high risk of bias, or we are uncertain whether the quality i ssue is likely to lead to high risk of bias. Domain 3. Prognostic factor measurement The prognostic factor measurement domain addresses adequacy of measurement of the prognostic factor of interest. Low risk of bias The measurement of the prognostic factor is unlikely to be dif ferent for different outcome levels (i.e. healed or not healed ). We will make an assignment of low risk of bias if all the following req uirements are met: a clear denition or description of the prognostic factor is giv en; the prognostic factor is measured similarly for all participa nts (same method and setting); a valid and reliable measure is used; continuous variables are used or appropriate cut-off points ar e applied; an adequate proportion of the sample has complete data for the prognostic factor; appropriate imputation of missing values is done. High risk of bias The measurement of the prognostic factor is very likely to be d ifferent for different outcome levels (i.e. healed or not heal ed). We will make an assignment of high risk of bias if any of the following statements apply and we consider there is a likely high risk of bias as a consequence: an unreliable or non-validated method is used to measure the p rognostic factor (non-differential misclassication bias); different approaches to prognostic factor measurement are ta ken for participants with different outcomes; details about the prognostic factor is based on recall or poten tially unreliable patient records (reporting bias); inappropriate cut-off points are used; the proportion of the sample with complete data for the progno stic factor is inadequate. Moderate risk of bias The measurement of the prognostic factor may be different for different outcome levels (e.g. healed or not healed) or for dif ferent risks of the outcome, but there is insufcient information to make a j udgement of low or high risk of bias, or we are uncertain whethe r the quality issue is likely to lead to high risk of bias. Domain 4. Outcome measurement The outcome measurement domain addresses the adequacy of outco me measurement. 23 Protease activity as a prognostic factor for wound healing i n venous leg ulcers (Protocol) Copyright \u00a9 2017 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.Low risk of bias The measurement of the outcome is unlikely to be different wit h respect to different baseline levels of the prognostic facto r. We will make an assignment of low risk of bias if all the following req uirements are met: a clear denition or description of the outcome is given (includin g duration of follow-up); the outcome of interest is measured similarly for all particip ants (same method and setting); a valid and reliable outcome measure is used (including blindin g and avoidance of recall methods). High risk of bias The measurement of the outcome is very likely to be different w ith respect to different baseline levels of the prognostic fa ctor. We will make an assignment of high risk of bias if any of the following statements apply and we consider there is a likely high risk of bias as a consequence: different methods are used for participants with different v alues of the prognostic factor; measurement of the outcome is not blinded; an unreliable or non-validated outcome measure is used; the outcome measure relies on patient/carer recall; measurement error varies according to the prognostic factor le vel. Moderate risk of bias The measurement of the outcome may be different for different baseline levels of the prognostic factor, but there is insuf cient information to make a judgement of low or high risk of bias, or we are uncertain whether the quality issue is likely to lead to high risk of bias. Domain 5. Adjustment The adjustment domain addresses potential factors that may d istort the relationship between prognostic factor and outcom e. Consid- erations in this domain help the assessor judge whether anot her factor may explain the study's reported association (see Appendix 1 ). Our literature review provided little evidence to enable us t o dene key adjustment factors, but in this domain, we will cons ider whether the included studies take into account age and infection ( Appendix 1 ). We will report and compare adjusting factors used across the studies. We will also examine whether there are differences b etween adjusted and unadjusted analyses. Low risk of bias Important key adjustment factors are appropriately accounted for. We will make an assignment of low risk of bias if all the fo llowing requirements are met: key adjustment factors are taken into account in the study desig n (e.g. matching, stratication) or in the analysis (e.g. multivariable regression) or adjusted and unadjusted anal yses have been compared and differences identied; key adjustment factors are measured adequately; measurement of all key adjustment factors is valid and reliab le (including blinding); methods and settings for measurement of adjustment factors a re the same for all participants; appropriate imputation methods are used; account has been taken of treatments in the analysis if appropr iate. High risk of bias The observed effect of the prognostic factor on the outcome is ve ry likely to be distorted by another factor related to the prog nostic factor and the outcome. We will make an assignment of high risk o f bias if any of the following statements apply and we consider there is a likely high risk of bias as a consequence: key adjustment factors are not taken into account in either the d esign or in the analysis; key adjustment factors are not measured adequately; methods or settings for the measurement of adjustment factor s are different for different prognostic factor levels or dif ferent outcome levels; 24 Protease activity as a prognostic factor for wound healing i n venous leg ulcers (Protocol) Copyright \u00a9 2017 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.interventions are different for different prognostic facto r levels or different outcome levels. Moderate risk of bias The observed effect of the prognostic factor on the outcome may b e distorted by another factor related to the prognostic factor and the outcome, but there is insufcient information to make a jud gement of low or high risk of bias, or we are uncertain whether t he quality issue is likely to lead to high risk of bias. Alternat ively, key adjustment factors considered in the design or anal ysis are unclear or the analytical procedure is poorly reported. Domain 6. Statistical analysis and reporting The statistical analysis and reporting domain addresses the appropriateness of the study's statistical analysis and comp leteness of reporting. If there are unit of analysis issues, these shoul d be analysed appropriately. The analytical approach and the results should be reported ful ly, regardless of their ndings or level of signicance. Low risk of bias The reported results are unlikely to be biased, either in rel ation to the analysis or the reporting of results. We will mak e an assignment of low risk of bias if all the following requirements are met: there is sufcient presentation of data to assess the adequacy of the analysis; the strategy for model building (i.e., inclusion of variables in the statistical model) is appropriate; the selected statistical model is adequate for the design of th e study (e.g. a conrmatory study is correctly analysed, and unit of analysis issues are considered appropriately); there is no selective reporting of results. High risk of bias The reported results are very likely to be biased, either rel ated to the analysis or the reporting of results. We will make an assignment of high risk of bias if any of the following statements apply a nd we consider there is a likely high risk of bias as a consequence : there is insufcient detail to assess the adequacy of the analy sis approach; the selected statistical model is inadequate; the analysis approach is inadequate (e.g. in selecting variabl es for a multivariable analysis or in including mediators in a regression analysis or ignoring important intervention ef fects); results are reported selectively, either on the basis of the ndings or statistical signicance. Moderate risk of bias The reported results may be biased, either related to the ana lysis or the reporting of results, but there is insufcient in formation to decide. All-domain risk of bias We will dene an all-domain risk of bias for each prognostic fact or-outcome combination, taking into account all of the above doma ins, but especially focusing on selection bias, study attrition, ad justment and statistical analysis & reporting. As a guide, we will assign risk of bias as follows: low risk of bias, if all (or all key) domains have low risk of bias; moderate risk of bias, if there is high r isk of bias for one key domain or moderate risk of bias for at least two key dom ains (with the rest as low risk of bias); or high risk of bias, if t here is high risk of bias for at least two key domains. 25 Protease activity as a prognostic factor for wound healing i n venous leg ulcers (Protocol) Copyright \u00a9 2017 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.Appendix 4. GRADE for prognostic factors Before assessing the GRADE factors for downgrading/upgradi ng, we will assign an initial GRADE rating as follows ( Hayden 2014 ): high for evidence based on phase 2 or phase 3 explanatory/conr matory studies, i.e. studies aimed at identifying independ ent associations between prognostic factor and outcome, or those i nvestigating mechanisms; moderate for evidence based on phase 1 exploratory studies, i .e. those aimed at investigating all associations, usually i n univariable analyses) or other studies reporting univaria ble associations or having sufcient data to calculate associati ons. Unlike GRADE for intervention studies, we will not initiall y rate differently the different types of study design (e.g. ca se control, retrospective or prospective cohort studies) because we will id entify quality issues in the 'Risk of bias' assessment. We will take into consideration the following GRADE factors, d owngrading (or upgrading) the evidence certainty as follows. Downgrading the evidence certainty 1. Risk of bias We will assign serious limitations (downgrade once) when most evidence is from studies with moderate all-domain risk of bias . We will assign very serious limitations (downgrade twice) when most e vidence is from studies with high all-domain risk of bias. 2. Indirectness Indirectness occurs when any, or all, of the study sample, the pr ognostic factor and the outcome do not accurately reflect the revie w question for most of the evidence. We will downgrade the evide nce certainty accordingly, taking into consideration whether di fferences are likely to be selection bias or indirectness. If the evidence is based on RCT data analysed as an observation al study, we will consider whether the trial's inclusion criter ia make the evidence indirect ( Iorio 2015 ). 3. Inconsistency The GRADE criteria for judging inconsistency include variabili ty in point estimates, extent of overlap in CIs, and consideri ng where point estimates lie in relation to decision thresholds. Prog nostic studies are often large and so CIs are narrow; this can m ean the overlap is small, leading to large I\u00b2 statistic values, which can be mis leading ( Iorio 2015 ). We will not rely solely on statistical measures of inconsistency, but will take these into account alongside asses sing variations in effect estimates across studies, consideri ng whether the point estimates lie on either side of the line of no effect, or w hether the range of point estimates are consistent with more t han one conclusion. We will conduct pre-specied subgroup analyses if the re are sufcient studies before making a judgement on inconsis tency (Guyatt 2011b ). 4. Imprecision The evidence if we nd the followin g: for is an insufcient sample size; an imprecise estimate of the effect size in the meta-analysis: i .e. the CI is wide and overlaps the null and contains values implying that the factor plays an important role in protecting or putting the individual at risk; there is within-study imprecision: for the majority of the stu dies, sample size justication is not provided and there are fewer than 10 outcome events for each prognostic variable (for d ichotomous outcomes) OR there are fewer than 100 cases per regression analysis ( Hayden 2014 ) or as few as 2 participants per prognostic variable ( Austin 2015 ) (for continuous outcomes); We will consider whether any CIs are wide because of inconsisten cy, which could lead to double counting of GRADE factors ( Iorio 2015 ). for a narrative summary: within-study imprecision: sample size justication is not pro vided and there are fewer than 10 outcome events for each prognostic variable (for dichotomous outcomes) OR there are fe wer than 100 cases per regression or 2 participants per prognos tic factor (for continuous outcomes); 26 Protease activity as a prognostic factor for wound healing i n venous leg ulcers (Protocol) Copyright \u00a9 2017 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.imprecision in the estimation of the effect size within each pri mary study, AND across-study imprecision: there are few studies and a small number of participants across studies. 5. Publication bias We will examine funnel plots for asymmetry provided there ar e at least 10 studies. We will also consider downgrading routi nely, unless the value of the risk/protective factor in predicting the outcom e has been repetitively investigated, ideally by phase 2 and 3 studies. Upgrading the evidence certainty 6. Large effect estimate We will consider upgrading the evidence certainty if the pooled effect (for meta-analysis) is moderate or large, or if a moderat e or large similar effect is reported by most studies (for a narrative sum mary). An effect estimate is considered moderate if the OR is 1.5 or 2, and large if it is > 2 ( Hemingway 1999 ). We note that risk of bias may lead to inflated effect estimates . 7. Dose effect We will upgrade the evidence certainty if, for meta-analysis, a gradient is present between analyses for factors measured at different levels (doses). For a narrative review, we will consider upgrad ing if studies seem similar apart from dose.
