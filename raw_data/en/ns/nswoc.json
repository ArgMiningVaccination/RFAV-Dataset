Chiropractic is an alternative form of healthcare that primarily deals with conditions affecting the musculoskeletal and nervous systems. Chiropractic medicine was founded in 1895 by D.D. Palmar whose philosophy was based around treating misalignments, or \"subluxations\", of the spine. The thought was that a misalignment can put pressure on a spinal nerve resulting in altered function and pain in the body. Over the years, chiropractic research and philosophy has evolved. Today, chiropractic physicians identify these \"misalignments\" as \"joint restriction\" and \"joint dysfunction\". The current physiological premise proposes that dysfunctional joint segments can produce adverse effects and pain through chemicals and neurologic impulses. These joints become restricted within the body due to a wide range of sources. Tight and inflamed muscles, bad posture, traumatic injuries, or simple everyday activities can be the source of the reduced motion in one's spine and extremities. What Exactly Does A Chiropractor Do? Chiropractors utilize hands on treatment to the muscles and joints. To treat joint dysfunction, chiropractors utilize adjustments, or spinal manipulative therapy (SMT). An adjustment is a quick and gentle thrust into a joint segment to enhance segmental mobility and function. Many studies highlight manipulative therapy as a safe and effective treatment option. Combined with chiropractic adjustments, chiropractors use various approaches to manually impact the muscles and other soft tissues of the body.
