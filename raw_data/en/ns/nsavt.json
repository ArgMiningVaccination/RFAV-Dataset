Meditation enables us to move from higher frequency brain waves to lower frequency, which activates different centres in the brain. Slower wave-lengths = more time between thoughts = more opportunity to skilfully choose which thoughts you invest in and what actions you take. Yogis have known for centuries and scientists can now prove, the benefits of meditation are profound. Meditation is perhaps the most crucial instrument to harness the power of thought, cultivate more peace, clarity and happiness. Learning to train the brain and focus our attention is crucial to thriving and cultivating a peak performance in any endeavour. Years ago I started meditation to attain these benefits & observing my success many of my friends learnt meditation from me replicating the same beneficial results in themselves, too. I remember the initial struggling phase which we all went through & I tried to find what was the common difficultly we all faced in our initial days to learn the meditation. I found 3 common difficulties encountered by all of us, although each one had few more & different challenges in learning meditation. These 3 common difficulties were, when we tried to reduce our thoughts some thought would arise in our mind & we would start drifting us with it, knowing well that this would not allow us to achieve a good meditation session. Detaching ourselves from those thoughts would just be impossible, the thoughts being so absorbing to make us follow it; thus forcing ourselves to pull out of it as we would soon realise that we are not meditating but roving with the thought. The second difficultly was experiencing of some kind of anxieties though we would not call it fear as we all know what fear means but some indistinguishable anxieties which when entering our mind would not allow us to advance/ progress with meditation but would rather make us to cause haste to come out of our meditative state. The third challenge was entering of a thought in our mind that we had a task which had to be completed immediately; though that task could be easily done after the meditation session we could not resist the impulsive thought of attending to that task immediately & our session of meditation would be spoiled as we had to end it abruptly because it would become impossible to control that thought and be in our meditative state. I know well there would be many more challenges that a person practicing mediation would face but these 3 were the ones which I confronted in myself & my friends too. Decades of Bach Flower Therapy practice have saved me & my friends from the challenges mentioned & I am contented to have assisted many more practitioner of meditation in overcoming their challenges in attaining a good meditative state with indicated Bach Remedies in those persons. The Bach remedies that helped us in the 3 conditions mentioned above were Clematis, Mimulus & Impatiens. Bach Remedies can be of use for various emotional, mental distresses that humanity suffers & we are eternally indebted to the founder of this system of flower remedies Dr. Edward Bach who made the system so simple that even a lay person can help himself & others including pets & plants with the wonderful Bach remedies.
