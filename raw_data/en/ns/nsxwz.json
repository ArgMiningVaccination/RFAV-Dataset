Recipe Oil Phase - 210g Fractionated Coconut Oil - 18g Fenugreek Seeds - 18g Hibiscus Flowers (dried) - 18g Amla Fruit (dried) - 18g Neem Leaves (dried) - 18g Marshmallow Root (dried) Cool Down - 1.5g Vitamin E Oil (antioxidant) Method - Measure out your oil phase ingredients: Fenugreek seeds, Hibiscus, Amla, Neem, Marshmallow root and your oil of choice, I'm using Fractionated Coconut Oil. - In a glass container with a tight-fitting lid (e.g. mason jar) pour in the ayurvedic herbs and your oil of choice. - Mix thoroughly and ensure the herbs completely covered, add more oil if necessary. - Set aside, ideally in a place with access to sunlight, and allow the herbs to infuse the oil for 2 - 4 weeks. Every few days stir the herbs to ensure they're evenly dispersed throughout the oil. - Once the oil is infused, it should take on a rich yellow-green hue and should be fragrant. - To strain, use either a muslin or cheese cloth, or coffee filter. This ensure you get maximum extraction but all the plant material has been filtered out. - Measure out your cool down ingredient: Vitamin E oil or another preferred antioxidant. Add this to your strained ayurvedic oil and mix thoroughly. - Store in a glass container (ideally tinted), away from direct sunlight. This ayurvedic hair oil is suitable to use on hair, scalp and skin but I always recommend carrying out a patch test first. This recipe makes 300g of Ayurvedic Oil and will last at least 12 months.

There's a lot of buzz around Ayurveda for hair - and with good reason! But with over 600 herbs and botanical plants, a rich and ancient history to unpack, and seemingly never-ending lists of benefits - it can be difficult to know where to start! Ayurvedic herbs can visibly improve the health and appearance of your hair, including stimulating hair growth, reducing split ends and breakage, strengthening and moisturising hair and so much more. So let's take a look into ayurvedic hair care and how to incorporate some of the most potent natural herbs, plants and flowers into your regime. The ayurvedic approach to hair care utilises botanical material such as herbs, leaves and flowers to improve and maintain the health of your hair. Derived from the ancient Indian medicine system that focuses on a holistic approach to managing health. The natural therapeutic properties of herbs can impact a variety of factors such as hair growth, dandruff and scalp issues, thinning and shedding, elasticity, moisture and the overall condition of your hair. How to make Ayurvedic oil Ayurvedic hair oil is a type of herbal oil made by infusing a carrier oil with ayurvedic botanical extracts. A selection of ayurvedic herbs are combined with vegetable or plant oil to create a herbal oil treatment with unique benfits for your hair and skin. Please note that while this ayurvedic oil has been primarily targeted at hair concerns, many of its benefits also apply to skincare and therefore can be used on both hair and skin. There are two primary methods to infuse oil: hot infusion and cold infusion, this recipe uses the cold infusion method. Cold infusion herbal oils take several weeks and use the warmth of sunlight to produce a potent ayurvedic oil. Once you've selected your herbs, ensure that they are completely dry and free from debris. In a sealable glass container, add your ayurvedic herbs and carrier oil. Allow this to sit at room temperature, ideally in a location with a lot of sunlight to infuse anywhere from 2 - 4 weeks. Over time the oil should take on a deeper colour and rich scent. After the oil has been strained, I recommend adding an antioxidant to prevent against rancidity.
