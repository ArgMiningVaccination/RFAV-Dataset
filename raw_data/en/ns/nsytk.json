Types of article Editorials Editorials are invited articles or comments concerning a specific paper in the Journal or a topical issue in the field. Although editorials are normally invited or written by an Editor, unsolicited editorials may be submitted. These are short, opinion articles which focus on current research topics and highlight articles of interest previously published elsewhere. Commentaries are generally invited by the Editors, but interested contributors with unsolicited commentaries are encouraged to submit them. Review Articles These should aim to provide the reader with a balanced overview of an important and topical subject within the Journal's aims and scope. The review should have a clear methodology of reviewing the contents for systematic reviews, narrative reviews and any other types of reviews. Most reviews are solicited by the editors, but unsolicited submissions may also be considered for publication. These may be clinical trials, cohort studies, diagnostic test accuracy studies, cost-effectiveness analyses, surveys, animal studies, and other research studies on integrative medicine and health, which represent new and significant contributions to the field. Short communications These are short reports of significant research. Short communications may include up to 2 figures or tables. These are short discussions of a case or case series with unique features not previously described that make an important teaching point or scientific observation. Case reports should include the significance and purpose of the case presentation, the diagnostic methods of the case, the key data, and brief comments and suggestions with regard to the case. Refer to the CARE guidelines and submit CARE checklist with the case report manuscript. Letters to the Editor These include brief constructive comments concerning previously published articles in the journal or very brief research reports. Letters are edited, sometimes extensively, to sharpen their focus. They are externally peer reviewed and go through the same peer review process as review or original articles. These are educational articles which are intended to describe and explain certain methodology, definition, or technique used in research in the field of integrative medicine. Guidelines These are reporting guidelines or clinical guidelines which is to assist and foster researchers and clinicians the best practice in research or clinical practice. Reporting guidelines Authors are required to adhere their manuscripts to recognized reporting guidelines where appropriate, and submit a relevant, completed checklist. Depending on the research design used, more specific extensions may be necessary. Below is the list of sample reporting guidelines: - Randomized controlled trials - CONSORT - Systematic review or meta-analysis - PRISMA - Observational studies - STROBE - Case reports - CARE - Animal research - ARRIVE [http://www.equator-network.org/](http://www.equator-network.org/)). Ethics in publishing For information on ethics in publishing and ethical guidelines for journal publication, refer to [https://www.journals.elsevier.com/integrative-medicine-research/policies-and-guidelines](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/integrative-medicine-research/policies-and-guidelines) Studies in humans and animals If the work involves the use of human subjects, the author should ensure that the work described has been carried out in accordance with the World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki - Ethical Principles for Medical Research Involving Human Subjects, [https://www.wma.net/policies-post/wma-declaration-of-helsinki-ethical-principles-for-medical-research-involving-human-subjects/](https://www.wma.net/policies-post/wma-declaration-of-helsinki-ethical-principles-for-medical-research-involving-human-subjects/), the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors Recommendations for the Conduct, Reporting, Editing and Publication of Scholarly Work in Medical Journals, [http://www.icmje.org/recommendations/](http://www.icmje.org/recommendations/). The privacy rights of human subjects must always be observed. All animal experiments should be carried out in accordance with the U.K. Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 and associated guidelines, EU Directive 2010/63/EU for animal experiments, or the National Institutes of Health guide for the care and use of laboratory animals (NIH Publications No. 8023, revised 1978), and comply with the ARRIVE guidelines. The authors should clearly indicate in the manuscript that such guidelines have been followed and an approval by the animal ethics committee has been obtained. All animal studies need to ensure they comply with the ARRIVE guidelines. Declaration of generative AI in scientific writing The below guidance only refers to the writing process, and not to the use of AI tools to analyse and draw insights from data as part of the research process. Where authors use generative artificial intelligence (AI) and AI-assisted technologies in the writing process, authors should only use these technologies to improve readability and language. Applying the technology should be done with human oversight and control, and authors should carefully review and edit the result, as AI can generate authoritative-sounding output that can be incorrect, incomplete or biased. AI and AI-assisted technologies should not be listed as an author or co-author, or be cited as an author. Authorship implies responsibilities and tasks that can only be attributed to and performed by humans, as outlined in Elsevier's [AI policy for authors](https://www.elsevier.com/about/policies/publishing-ethics#Authors). Disclosure instructions Authors must disclose the use of generative AI and AI-assisted technologies in the writing process by adding a statement at the end of their manuscript in the core manuscript file, before the References list. The statement should be placed in a new section entitled 'Declaration of Generative AI and AI-assisted technologies in the writing process'. This declaration does not apply to the use of basic tools for checking grammar, spelling, references etc. If there is nothing to disclose, there is no need to add a statement. Submission declaration and verification Submission of an article implies that the work described has not been published previously (except in the form of an abstract or as part of a published lecture or academic thesis or as an electronic preprint, see [https://www.elsevier.com/about/policies/sharing](https://www.elsevier.com/about/policies/sharing)), that it is not under consideration for publication elsewhere, that its publication is approved by all authors and tacitly or explicitly by the responsible authorities where the work was carried out, and that, if accepted, it will not be published elsewhere, including electronically, in the same form, in English or in any other language, without the written consent of the copyright-holder. To verify originality, your article may be checked by the originality detection service Crossref Similarity Check: [https://www.elsevier.com/editors/perk/plagiarism-complaints/plagiarism-detection](https://www.elsevier.com/editors/perk/plagiarism-complaints/plagiarism-detection). Preprints Please note that [preprints](https://www.elsevier.com/about/policies/sharing/preprint) can be shared anywhere at any time, in line with Elsevier's [sharing policy](https://www.elsevier.com/about/policies/sharing). Sharing your preprints e.g. on a preprint server will not count as prior publication (see ' [Multiple, redundant or concurrent publication](https://www.elsevier.com/authors/journal-authors/policies-and-ethics)' for more information). Use of inclusive language Inclusive language acknowledges diversity, conveys respect to all people, is sensitive to differences, and promotes equal opportunities. Content should make no assumptions about the beliefs or commitments of any reader; contain nothing which might imply that one individual is superior to another on the grounds of age, gender, race, ethnicity, culture, sexual orientation, disability or health condition; and use inclusive language throughout. Authors should ensure that writing is free from bias, stereotypes, slang, reference to dominant culture and/or cultural assumptions. We advise to seek gender neutrality by using plural nouns (\"clinicians, patients/clients\") as default/wherever possible to avoid using \"he, she,\" or \"he/she.\" We recommend avoiding the use of descriptors that refer to personal attributes such as age, gender, race, ethnicity, culture, sexual orientation, disability or health condition unless they are relevant and valid. When coding terminology is used, we recommend to avoid offensive or exclusionary terms such as \"master\", \"slave\", \"blacklist\" and \"whitelist\". We suggest using alternatives that are more appropriate and (self-) explanatory such as \"primary\", \"secondary\", \"blocklist\" and \"allowlist\". These guidelines are meant as a point of reference to help identify appropriate language but are by no means exhaustive or definitive. Reporting sex- and gender-based analyses Reporting guidance For research involving or pertaining to humans, animals or eukaryotic cells, investigators should integrate sex and gender-based analyses (SGBA) into their research design according to funder/sponsor requirements and best practices within a field. Authors should address the sex and/or gender dimensions of their research in their article. In cases where they cannot, they should discuss this as a limitation to their research's generalizability. Importantly, authors should explicitly state what definitions of sex and/or gender they are applying to enhance the precision, rigor and reproducibility of their research and to avoid ambiguity or conflation of terms and the constructs to which they refer (see Definitions section below). Authors can refer to the [Sex and Gender Equity in Research (SAGER) guidelines](https://doi.org/10.1186/s41073-016-0007-6) and the [SAGER guidelines checklist](https://doi.org/10.3897/ese.2022.e86910). These offer systematic approaches to the use and editorial review of sex and gender information in study design, data analysis, outcome reporting and research interpretation - however, please note there is no single, universally agreed-upon set of guidelines for defining sex and gender. Sex generally refers to a set of biological attributes that are associated with physical and physiological features (e.g., chromosomal genotype, hormonal levels, internal and external anatomy). A binary sex categorization (male/female) is usually designated at birth (\"sex assigned at birth\"), most often based solely on the visible external anatomy of a newborn. Gender generally refers to socially constructed roles, behaviors, and identities of women, men and gender-diverse people that occur in a historical and cultural context and may vary across societies and over time. Gender influences how people view themselves and each other, how they behave and interact and how power is distributed in society. Sex and gender are often incorrectly portrayed as binary (female/male or woman/man) and unchanging whereas these constructs actually exist along a spectrum and include additional sex categorizations and gender identities such as people who are intersex/have differences of sex development (DSD) or identify as non-binary. Moreover, the terms \"sex\" and \"gender\" can be ambiguous\u2014thus it is important for authors to define the manner in which they are used. In addition to this definition guidance and the SAGER guidelines, the [resources on this page](https://www.elsevier.com/authors/policies-and-guidelines/edi#SAGER)offer further insight around sex and gender in research studies. Changes to authorship Authors are expected to consider carefully the list and order of authors before submitting their manuscript and provide the definitive list of authors at the time of the original submission. Any addition, deletion or rearrangement of author names in the authorship list should be made only before the manuscript has been accepted and only if approved by the journal Editors. To request such a change before acceptance, the editors must receive the following from the corresponding author: (a) the reason for the change in author list and (b) written confirmation (letter signed by all authors) that they agree with the addition, removal or rearrangement. In the case of addition or removal of authors, this includes confirmation from the author being added or removed. Only in exceptional circumstances will the editors consider the addition, deletion or rearrangement of authors after the manuscript has been accepted. While the Editor considers the request, publication of the manuscript will be suspended.

Figures Figure legends should be submitted for all figures and should be brief and specific and placed on a separate sheet after the reference section. Figure legend example: Fig. 1. Demographic characteristics of patients. Figures must be in numerical order using Arabic numerals in the order of their citation in the text. Figures should be uploaded as separate fi les, not embedded in the manuscript file. Regardless of the application used, when your electronic artwork is finalized, please \"save as\" or convert the images to one of the following formats (note the resolution requirements for line drawings, halftones, and line/halftone combinations given below): EPS: Vector drawings. Embed the font or save the text as \"graphics\". TIFF: Color or grayscale photographs (halftones)-use a minimum of 300 dpi. TIFF: Bitmapped line drawings-use a minimum of 1000 dpi. TIFF: Combination of bitmapped line/half-tone (color or grayscale)-use a minimum of 600 dpi. DOC, XLS or PPT: If your electronic artwork is created in any of these Microsoft Office applications, please supply \"as is\". Please do not: Supply files that are optimized for screen use (like GIF, BMP, PICT, WPG) as the resolution is too low; Supply files that are too low in resolution; Submit graphics that are disproportionately large for the content. REVIEW AND ACTION The Editorial and Peer Review Process As a general rule, the receipt of a manuscript will be acknowledged within 2 weeks of submission; authors will be provided with a manuscript reference number for future correspondence. If an acknowledgment is not received in a reasonable period of time, the author should contact the Editorial Office (imr@kiom.re.kr). Submissions are reviewed by the Editorial Office to ensure that it contains all parts. Submissions will be rejected if the author has not supplied all the material and documents as outlined in the Journal's author guidelines. Manuscripts are then reviewed by the Editors, who make an initial assessment. If the manuscript does not appear to be of sufficient merit or is not appropriate for the Journal, the manuscript will be rejected without review. All other manuscripts are sent to 2 or more expert consultants for single-blind peer review. Authors will usually be notified within 12 weeks of the initial acknowledgment of whether the manuscript is accepted for publication, rejected, or subject to revision before acceptance. However, do note that delays are sometimes unavoidable. Appeals regarding manuscripts rejected by Integrative Medicine Research Integrative Medicine Research is able to consider only a relatively small percentage of submissions received for publication. Therefore, many good manuscripts are rejected without peer reviews. If your paper is declined without peer review, please do not appeal the decision. Doing so distracts the journal's editors and reviewers from evaluating submissions and processing other manuscripts. If, however, the reviewer or editor evaluations are needed to be reassessed, the Editor-in-Chief will consider an appeal and reopen the manuscript's file. Any appeal must be made by the corresponding author to the Editorial Office by email prior to resubmitting the manuscript. Please do not resubmit a revised version of a rejected manuscript without an appeal to the Editorial office. Please do not resubmit until your original manuscript is released back to you. By waiting for the manuscript release, it ensures that your paper is processed under the same manuscript number, keeping the manuscript history intact. Occasionally, a manuscript is rejected but the Editorial Board offers the option to resubmit a revised, abridged version as a Letter or Commentary. Roles of Editors and Editorial Board Members Associate Editor Editor-in-Chief - Responsible for the whole journal content - Select, appoint and manage associate editors and editorial board members - Attract high-quality manuscripts - Assist EiC in getting manuscripts reviewed and published - Assure quality of publications - Attract high-quality manuscripts Associate Editor - Assist EiC and AEs - Handle day-to-day editorial tasks - Perform technical check on all submitted manuscripts Assistant Managing Editor - Assist ME - Promote and advertise the Journal via social networking servicesAdvisory Editorial Board - A group of respected scholars in the field of Traditional Medicine, Complementary and Alternative Medicine, and Integrative Medicine. - Advise on policy and scope of the Journal Editorial Board - A group of respected scholars in the field of Traditional Medicine, Complementary and Alternative Medicine, and Integrative Medicine. - Assist with peer review - Encourage others to submit manuscripts or submit their own work - Give feedback and suggestions on contents of the Journal Early Career Editorial Board - Assist with peer review - Encourage others to submit manuscripts or submit their own work - Promote the Journal Special issue organization The peer review process for Special Issues is also a single anonymized review process. All contributions will be initially assessed by the Editor-in-chief for suitability for the journal. Papers deemed suitable are then assigned to a Guest Editor who is appointed by the journal editorial board. All Guest Editors receive training on conducting peer review. The Guest Editor sends the manuscript to a minimum of two independent expert reviewers to assess the scientific quality of the paper. The Guest Editor makes a recommendation for the decision to the Editor in Chief. The Editor in Chief is responsible for the final decision regarding acceptance or rejection of articles. The Editor-in-Chief oversees the peer review process of all Special Issues to ensure the high standards of publishing ethics and responsiveness are respected. Guest Editors are not involved in decisions about papers which they have written themselves or have been written by family members or colleagues or which relate to products or services in which the guest editor has an interest. Any such submission is subject to all of the journal's usual procedures, with peer review handled independently of the relevant editor and their research groups. Use of the Digital Object Identifier The Digital Object Identifier (DOI) may be used to cite and link to electronic documents. The DOI consists of a unique alpha-numeric character string which is assigned to a document by the publisher upon the initial electronic publication. The assigned DOI never changes. Therefore, it is an ideal medium for citing a document, particularly 'Articles in press' because they have not yet received their full bibliographic information. Example of a correctly given DOI (in URL format; here an article in the journal Physics Letters B): [http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.physletb.2010.09.059](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.physletb.2010.09.059). When you use a DOI to create links to documents on the web, the DOIs are guaranteed never to change. Proofs Corresponding authors will receive an e-mail with a link to our online proofing system, allowing annotation and correction of proofs online. The environment is similar to MS Word: in addition to editing text, you can also comment on figures/tables and answer questions from the Copy Editor. Web-based proofing provides a faster and less error-prone process by allowing you to directly type your corrections, eliminating the potential introduction of errors.All instructions for proofing will be given in the e-mail we send to authors, including alternative methods to the online version and PDF. We will do everything possible to get your article published quickly and accurately. Please use this proof only for checking the typesetting, editing, completeness and correctness of the text, tables and figures. Significant changes to the article as accepted for publication will only be considered at this stage with permission from the Editor. It is important to ensure that all corrections are sent back to us in one communication. Please check carefully before replying, as inclusion of any subsequent corrections cannot be guaranteed. Proofreading is solely your responsibility.

PEER REVIEW This journal operates a single blind review process. All contributions will be initially assessed by the editor for suitability for the journal. Papers deemed suitable are then typically sent to a minimum of two independent expert reviewers to assess the scientific quality of the paper. The Editor is responsible for the final decision regarding acceptance or rejection of articles. The Editor's decision is final. [More information on types of peer review](https://www.elsevier.com/reviewers/what-is-peer-review). Data references This journal encourages you to cite underlying or relevant datasets in your manuscript by citing them in your text and including a data reference in your Reference List. Data references should include the following elements: author name(s), dataset title, data repository, version (where available), year, and global persistent identifier. Add [dataset] immediately before the reference so we can properly identify it as a data reference. The [dataset] identifier will not appear in your published article. Preprint references Where a preprint has subsequently become available as a peer-reviewed publication, the formal publication should be used as the reference. If there are preprints that are central to your work or that cover crucial developments in the topic, but are not yet formally published, these may be referenced. Preprints should be clearly marked as such, for example by including the word preprint, or the name of the preprint server, as part of the reference. The preprint DOI should also be provided. Research data This journal encourages and enables you to share data that supports your research publication where appropriate, and enables you to interlink the data with your published articles. Research data refers to the results of observations or experimentation that validate research findings, which may also include software, code, models, algorithms, protocols, methods and other useful materials related to the project. Below are a number of ways in which you can associate data with your article or make a statement about the availability of your data when submitting your manuscript. If you are sharing data in one of these ways, you are encouraged to cite the data in your manuscript and reference list. Please refer to the \"References\" section for more information about data citation.

Data linking If you have made your research data available in a data repository, you can link your article directly to the dataset. Elsevier collaborates with a number of repositories to link articles on ScienceDirect with relevant repositories, giving readers access to underlying data that gives them a better understanding of the research described. There are different ways to link your datasets to your article. When available, you can directly link your dataset to your article by providing the relevant information in the submission system. For more information, visit the [database linking page](https://www.elsevier.com/authors/tools-and-resources/research-data/data-base-linking). [supported data repositories](https://www.elsevier.com/authors/tools-and-resources/research-data/data-base-linking#repositories)a repository banner will automatically appear next to your published article on ScienceDirect. In addition, you can link to relevant data or entities through identifiers within the text of your manuscript, using the following The corresponding author will be notified and receive a link to the published version of the open access article on [ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com).
