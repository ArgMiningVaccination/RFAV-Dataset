At this time treatment for egg allergy by desensitization is an experimental procedure. If your child is allergic to egg, strict avoidance of hens egg and egg products is th e surest way to prevent symptoms. The majority of children reacting to egg react to the egg white. Some pat ients will react to uncooked egg but will tolerate cooked egg. Although egg yolk is considered less allergenic than egg white, sensitization to the egg yolk may sometimes occur. In addition egg yolk can be contaminated by egg white proteins and should be avoided. Other forms of egg (e.g. duck) should be avoided, as sometimes there is cross reactivity . What Foods Contain Egg? Foods that will conta in egg Foods likely to contain egg that should be checked carefully Omelettes Quiche Egg and Bacon Pie Frittata Pavlova Meringue Flans and tarts Choux Pastry (cream puffs, chocolate \u00e9clairs) French toast Spinach Pie Crumbed and battered products Patties, burgers, meatloaf, sausages Processed or sandwich meats Bakery items such as pastries, cakes, doughnuts, biscuits and slices Cakes and cake mixes Pasta, spaghetti and Noodles Custard Ice-cream or sorbet Mousse Salad dressings (Coleslaw, Mayonnaise) Asian , eg, Pad Thai, fried rice, noodles Marshmallow Nougat Lemon Butter Soups Dips Pizza Egg Allergy - 5/03/2013 /2 Will my child grow out of their allergy? For the majority of children, their egg allergy will resolve by 10 -12 yrs of age and often earlier. The doctors will determine if your child has grown out of their egg allergy by a combination of skin testing and food challenge with egg. Skin tests may be repeated periodically to monitor your child's allergies. A positive skin test to egg does not always mean your child will have symptoms when they eat egg, therefore a cautious challenge may be the only way to determine if your child has grown out of their egg allergy. Challenges may need to be done in a hospital by experienced medi cal staff. Do not do challenges at home unless discussed with your doctor. Do all forms of egg need to be avoided? Heating and cooking egg can change the form of the proteins. In some cases raw or lightly cooked egg may result in an allergic reaction whereas well cooked egg incorporated in foods such as cakes or biscuits may be tolerated. Your doctor will advise what forms of egg need to be avoided.

When combined with wate r it can be used in place of egg in cakes, muffins and pancakes. Egg substitutes are not suitable as they contain egg protein. They are products designed for low cholesterol diets and are based on egg whites. LABEL READING Ingredients List All packaged foods must have an ingredients list. You must check this ingredients list for any ingredients that may contain egg. Since 2002, it has been law that all potential food allergens (peanut, tree nut, seafood, fish, milk, eggs, soybeans and wheat) must be clearly identified, however small the amount. Example : instead of simply albumin the ingredients list should read Albumin (egg) or egg albumin. ALWAYS check the ingredients list every time you buy the food as the ingredients of the product may change. Egg protein containing ingredients include: Egg (white and yolk) Albumin Dried egg or powdered egg Globulin Livetin Ovalbumin Ovomucin Ovomucoid Ovovitellin Does my child have to avoid eating chicken? No. Allergy to chicken is very uncommon and is different to egg allergy. Do all egg based ingredients need to be avoided? No. Egg lecithin and egg emulsifier are made from the fat component of the egg and the chance of an allergic reaction to these ingredients is unlikely. \"May contain traces of egg\" statements These statements are used by manufacturers to indicate that the product may be contaminated with egg through processing and packaging. At present these statements are voluntary and there are no clear guidelines for companies regarding how and when to use them. The wording of the statements makes it very difficult to determine your level of risk and a product that does not contain the statement may be no safer than a product that does. The chances of having a significant allergic reaction through contamination are extremely unlikely and most families choose to ignore these statements as the only safe al ternative is to not include any commercial food products in your diet. FOOD PREPARATION Highly allergic children can have a mild reaction from foods contaminated with egg from cooking surfaces and utensils, being in the kitchen when egg is being cooked or when touched by someone who has been handling eggs. Egg Allergy - 5/03/2013 /4 VACCINATIONS FOR CHILDREN WITH EGG ALLERGY All routine vaccinations including MMR vaccine can be safely administered to children with egg allergy. MMR vaccine is not prepared in eggs but on chicke n fibroblasts. MMR vaccine can be given to egg allergic patients . Influenza, yellow fever and Q fever vaccines contain some egg proteins. Therefore, in patients with previous anaphylactic reactions to egg, if it is decided to vaccinate these vaccines sho uld be administered cautiously in split doses, under medical supervision. Children who have egg allergy without a history of anaphylaxis may receive the influenza, yellow fever and Q vaccines as a single dose under medical supervision. "}
