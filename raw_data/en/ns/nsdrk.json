International trade, travel, tourism and many other business activities including in-person interactions have almost come to a standstill. Several countries have put serious restrictions with very strict guidelines for citizens to follow and keep their lives in some momentum. Life sciences experts around the world are facing several challenges in handling novel corona virus and antiviral vaccine is still in progress of research and testing. Since ancient era our nation has a great knowledge of some of the classical traditional medicine system like Ayurvedic, Unani and Siddha. Among all these systems, Ayurveda seems to be the most effective one in terms of boosting the immunity. Ayurveda comes from the Sanskrit word Ayur that means life and Veda that means knowledge. It is an alternative medicine system with historical roots in the Indian subcontinent. Therapies are typically based on complex herbal compounds, minerals and metal substances (perhaps under the influence of early Indian alchemy or rasa shastra). The main classical Ayurveda texts begin with accounts of the transmission of medical knowledge from the gods to sages, and then to human physicians. Experts say that Ayurveda can stimulate the immune-modulators within human body and enhance the immunity system. From the past 2,000 years Ayurveda research has a good impact on the human being without any side effects. Based on reports, citizens around the world are generally becoming victims of a high level of psychological distress including symptoms of anxiety and depression. Recent research by our experts reveal that it can positively influence immunity system either by direct effects on symptoms of depression or anxiety, or through their symbolic significance. Therefore, it is possible that such traditional practices could be beneficial both in terms of psychological quality of life, and in terms of moderating the risk of infection. Given the extraordinary benefits and a significant role in enhancing immunity and prevention of associated diseases, Government of Goa should consider promoting practice of Ayurveda on a war footing. Government should give a special grant to the project for creating at least 500 small clinics at various locations in Goa for driving mass scale immunity booster programme. In a longer run, all such clinics can be utilised for research and popularising ayurveda practice. Most recently, Government of Kerala has implemented similar model for enhancing immunity of its citizens. Government of Goa should aggressively study the working model of Kerala and replicate the same with further possible innovation and value additions. We must remember that active cases are still on rise and decline will continue only if there are no major mutations. Boosting immunity of our citizens would be the key to fight the pandemic. If human body will be strong enough with high immune system then there would be a probability that the virus may be inactive within the body. "}
