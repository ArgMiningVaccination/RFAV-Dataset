PCOD (Poly Cystic Ovarian Disease) or PCOS (Poly Cystic Ovarian Syndrome) is a disease characterized by multiple ('poly') cysts (small sacs filled with fluid) in the ovaries. Patients with PCOD have abnormal levels of hormones that result in irregular menses, infertility and certain masculine changes in the body. What causes PCOD? PCOS problems are caused by hormone changes the hormonal imbalance. One hormone change triggers another, which changes another. - Raised levels of Testosterone - Androgens or \"male hormones,\" although all women make small amounts of androgens...Higher than normal androgen levels in women can prevent the ovaries from releasing an egg (ovulation) during each menstrual cycle. Excess androgen produced by the theca cells of the ovaries, due either to hyperinsulinemia or increased luteinizing hormone (LH) levels. - Raised levels of Luteinising Hormone (LH) - Due to increased production from the anterior pituitary. This stimulates ovulation but may have an abnormal effect on the ovaries if levels are too high. - low levels of Sex Hormone-Binding Globulin (SHBG) - A protein in the blood, which binds to testosterone and reduces the effect of testosterone. - Raised levels of Prolactin - Hormone that stimulates the breast glands to produce milk during pregnancy. - High levels of Insulin (a hormone that helps convert sugars and starches into energy) If you have insulin resistance, your ability to use insulin effectively is impaired, and also your pancreas has to secrete more insulin to make glucose available to cells (so, hyperinsulinaemia) Excess insulin might also affect the ovaries by increasing androgen production, which may interfere with the ovaries' ability to ovulate. A significant hereditary component, if your mother or sister has PCOS, you're more likely to have it. If you're overweight, your chances of developing it are greater. As weight gain increases insulin resistance. Fatty tissues are hormonally active and they produce estrogen which disrupts ovulation. What are the symptoms of PCOD? Generally, the patient presents with the following symptoms: Various hormones of the body operate in harmony to regularize the smooth functioning of all systems including the reproductive system. The disturbance of the hormonal mechanism makes the ovaries produce an excessive amount of the male reproductive hormones (androgens) and at the same time, there is a failure of egg formation. This excess of androgens with the absence of ovulation may cause infertility. With this understanding, that the disturbed hormonal functioning of the body lies at the root of PCOD, it can be easily perceived that this constitutional disorder will require a constitutional approach to its rectification. The homeopathic approach to the management of PCOD is constitutional, taking into account the presenting complaints along with physical, mental and genetic make-up that individualizes a person. Homeopathic medicines that act at the root level can bring back deviations of the hormonal system back to normalcy and in many cases abolish the need for exogenous hormones with their side effects and complicated surgical procedures. Moreover, with this hormonal harmony, chances of conception increase significantly. How is PCOD diagnosed? - Typical medical history: Regular/ irregular menstrual cycles, heavy/scanty menstrual flow, the need to take hormonal tablets (progestins) to induce a period, etc. - Physical Signs: Often obese and may have hirsutism, (excessive facial and body hair) as a result of the high androgen levels. - Diagnosis can be confirmed by vaginal Ultrasound (USG pelvis) shows that both the ovaries are enlarged; the bright central stroma is increased, and there are multiple small cysts in the ovaries. These cysts are usually arranged in the form of a necklace along the periphery of the ovary - Blood levels of hormones: - High LH (luteinizing hormone) level; and a Normal FSH level (follicle stimulating hormone) i.e. a reversal of the LH: FSH ratio, which is normally 1:1. - Elevated levels of androgens (a high dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S) level); - Fasting cholesterol and triglyceride levels; - Glucose tolerance test. Diet for PCOD: Polycystic ovarian disease is a common hormonal disorder found in one out of 10 women. Women suffer from irregular menses, and unusual hair growth on the body and most of them gain weight too. Others may not show any symptoms and have a normal body type along with small cysts in the ovaries. Females are noted to have a predisposition to PCOD or it may also run into families. A right diet with adequate exercise has shown great results in PCOD recovery. The dos and don'ts in a PCOD diet: - Diet should be dominated by lots of fruits and vegetables on a daily basis.
