In addition, the clinical data showed that VLA15 induced protection in mice against challenges with four clinically relevant [Borrelia species](https://www.cdc.gov/lyme/mayonii/index.html) (B. burgdorferi, B. afzelii, B. garinii, and B. bavariensis) expressing five of the six OspA [serotypes](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8887347/) included in the vaccine. The journal [The Lancet Infectious Diseases](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/home) published results from a [study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1473309923002104) on July 4, 2023, that concluded Valneva's novel multivalent Lyme vaccine candidate was safe and immunogenic.

According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), [Lyme disease](https://www.cdc.gov/lyme/index.html) is a systemic infection caused by Borrelia bacteria transmitted to humans by infected [Ixodes ticks](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fcimb.2020.00142/full). It is considered the most common vector-borne illness in the Northern Hemisphere and [Europe](https://www.euro.who.int/en/health-topics/disease-prevention/vaccines-and-immunization/news/news/2014/04/first-hand-experience-vector-borne-diseases/living-where-lyme-disease-is-common). Nearly all human infections are caused only B burgdorferi sensu stricto causes Lyme borreliosis in the U.S. On June 13, 2022, the journal [BMJ Global Health](https://gh.bmj.com/content/7/6/e007744) reported that about 14% of the world's population probably has or has had tick-borne Lyme disease, as indicated by the presence of antibodies in the blood, a pooled data analysis of the available evidence. In addition, the reported estimated global Bb seropositivity is relatively high, with the top three regions as Central Europe, Western Europe, and Eastern Asia. A report from [FAIR Health](https://www.fairhealthconsumer.org/#about), from 2007 to 2021, indicates [Lyme diagnoses](https://www.fairhealth.org/article/fair-health-spotlights-lyme-disease) rose 357% in rural regions and 65% in urban areas. And in June and July, insurance claim lines with Lyme disease diagnoses were more common in rural than urban areas. But from [November to April](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/private-insurance-claim-lines-with-diagnoses-of-lyme-disease-evidence-notable-increases-from-2007-to-2016-300493598.html), claim lines with Lyme disease diagnoses occurred more often in urban than rural areas. In addition, the CDC published 'Comparison of Lyme Disease in the [United States and Europe](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/27/8/20-4763_article)' on July 18, 2021. Patients with erythema migrans more often have concomitant systemic symptoms in the United States s than in Europe. VLA15 Dosage The randomized, placebo-controlled, Phase 3 [VALOR](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05477524) study participants a three-dose (Month 0-2-6) or a two-dose (Month 0-6) vaccination schedule. Higher antibody levels were observed in the three-dose vaccination schedule. VLA15 Side Effects In the [VLA15-202](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03970733) phase 2 study, VLA15 was found [safe and well-tolerated](https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/valneva-and-pfizer-report-further-positive-phase-2-results) across all doses and age groups. No related Serious Adverse Events were observed in any treatment group and through a [one-month post-booster](https://valneva.com/press-release/valneva-and-pfizer-report-further-positive-phase-2-results-including-booster-response-for-lyme-disease-vaccine-candidate/#_ftn1). VLA15-221's main safety and immunogenicity readout in adults were performed at month seven. The clinical trial is ongoing to assess the safety and immunogenicity of VLA15 in a pediatric population aged five years and above. Lyme Disease Tests The U.S. [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/lyme/index.html) currently recommends a 2-step testing process for Lyme disease. Both steps are required and can be done using the same blood sample. Lyme Disease Genetic Susceptibility The peer-review journal Cell Reports published a [study](https://www.cell.com/cell-reports-medicine/fulltext/S2666-3791(22)00375-5#%20) on November 15, 2022: Gene set predictor for post-treatment Lyme disease. By distilling gene sets from this study with gene sets from other sources, the researchers identified a subset of genes highly expressed in the cohorts but not already established as biomarkers for inflammatory response or other viral or bacterial infections. They further reduce this gene set by feature importance to establish an mRNA biomarker set capable of distinguishing healthy individuals from those with acute LD or PTLD as a candidate for translation into an LD diagnostic.

Following the Run-In phase for Valneva's first Phase 2 study, VLA15-201, the two dosage levels (135\u00b5g and 180\u00b5g) have been selected for further development based on Data and Safety Monitoring Board clearance. VLA15 Clinical Trials VLA15 continues under [clinical trials](https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?cond=Lyme+Disease&term=valneva&cntry=&state=&city=&dist=) to test its Immunogenicity Safety and dosing. On July 4, 2023, The Lancet Infectious Diseases [wrote](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1473309923002104) - Between Jan 23, 2017, and Jan 16, 2019, of 254 participants screened for eligibility, 179 were randomly assigned into six groups: alum-adjuvanted 12 g (n=29), 48 g (n=31), or 90 g (n=31) and non-adjuvanted 12 g (n=29 participants), 48 g (n=29), or 90 g (n=30). VLA15 was safe and well tolerated, and the majority of adverse events were mild or moderate. Overall, adverse events were more frequent in the 48 g and 90 g groups (range 2830 participants [9497%]) when compared with the 12 g group (25 [86%] participants, 95% CI 69\u00b74-94\u00b75) for adjuvanted and non-adjuvanted groups. Common local reactions were tenderness (151 [84%] participants; 356 events, 95% CI 78\u00b7389\u00b74) and injection site pain (120 [67%]; 224 events, 59\u00b79-73\u00b75); most frequent systemic reactions were headache (80 [45%]; 112 events, 37\u00b76-52\u00b70), excessive fatigue (45 [25%]; 56 events, 19\u00b74-32\u00b70), and myalgia (45 [25%]; 57 events, 19\u00b74-32\u00b70). A similar safety and tolerability profile was observed between adjuvanted and non-adjuvanted formulations. The majority of solicited adverse events were mild or moderate. VLA15 was immunogenic for all OspA serotypes with higher immune responses induced in the adjuvanted higher dose groups (geometric mean titre range 90 alum 61\u00b73 U/mL-321\u00b77 U/mL-111\u00b75 U/mL at 90 without alum). On February 17, 2023, Pfizer and Valnea announced that Pfizer, as the study [VALOR](https://www.pfizerclinicaltrials.com/nct05477524) sponsor, has decided to discontinue a significant percentage of participants in the U.S. who had been enrolled in the VALOR Phase 3 clinical study. These study participants, representing approximately half of the total recruited participants in the trial, are discontinued following violations of [Good Clinical Practice](https://www.fda.gov/science-research/clinical-trials-and-human-subject-protection/regulations-good-clinical-practice-and-clinical-trials) at specific clinical trial sites run by a third-party clinical trial site operator. The discontinuation of these participants was not due to any safety concerns with the investigational vaccine and was not prompted by a participant-reported adverse event. The companies [confirmed](https://valneva.com/press-release/valneva-reports-full-year-2022-results-and-provides-corporate-updates/) on March 23, 2023, they intend to work with regulatory authorities and, as previously announced, aim for Pfizer to potentially maintain the original submission timelines, pending successful completion of the Phase 3 studies and subject to the agreement of these regulatory agencies to proposed modifications of the clinical trial plan. Clinical Study [VLA15-221](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04801420) is a randomized, observer-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 study. The first clinical study with VLA15 enrolls a pediatric population aged five years and older. 294 healthy adult participants received VLA15 at two different immunization schedules (month 0-2-6 [N=97] or month 0-6 [N=90]) or three doses of placebo (month 0-2-6 [N=107]). Vaccine recipients received VLA15 at a dose of 180 \u00b5g, which was selected based on data generated in the two previous Phase 2 studies. The main safety and immunogenicity readout in adults were performed at month 7. A subset of participants will receive a booster dose of VLA15 or placebo at month 18 (booster phase) and will be followed for three additional years to monitor antibody persistence. The VLA15-221 trial is ongoing to assess the safety and immunogenicity of VLA15 in a pediatric population aged five years and above. On August 8, 2022, the companies announced the initiation of a [Phase 3 clinical study](https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-and-valneva-initiate-phase-3-study-lyme-disease), Vaccine Against Lyme for Outdoor Recreationists ( [VALOR](https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05477524)), to investigate the efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of their investigational Lyme disease vaccine candidate, VLA15.
