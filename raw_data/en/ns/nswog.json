Importantly there are two primary types of Pathology - these are known as Anatomic Pathology and Clinical Pathology. Anatomical Pathology is concerned with the microscopic analysis of tissue. Pathologists specializing in this branch of Pathology usually work in tandem with surgeons and play a critical role in the identification of the tissue removed during the process of a surgery - particularly in cases when there is a tumor suspected. Very often, pathologists are able to analyze a sample of tissue, whilst the surgery is still being conducted and advise the surgeon on the findings. This instant diagnosis is of great assistance to the surgeon as it helps in determining the next step in the surgical treatment of the patient. Further, the tissue is analyzed over the next few days after the surgery in order to accurately diagnose the spread and the prognosis of the ailment. In addition, pathologists specializing in anatomic pathology, who are available through the entire day to analyze tissue extracted during a surgery, can also review initial diagnosis and provide a second opinion.
