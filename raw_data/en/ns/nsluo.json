This is an urgently needed book. Even though it is primarily aimed at and pitched for practitioners, it is also needed by students, sceptics, media and bureaucrats. It is more than ironic that homeopathy, currently finding itself at the fringes of complementary medicine (CAM) and struggling against consistent and orchestrated attacks, is receiving significant validation from data coming out of research into hom oprophylaxis (HP). Controversial even to homeopaths, HP sends some medics and opponents of CAM apoplectic. Little about homeopathy is more poorly understood than this area. It has been like this from the outset. Over the years misuse of terms has been prevalent and there has been a profound lack of listening by those on different sides of the debate. Vaccination is a complex issue which cannot be addressed in any short discussion. It requires time and depth. There is significant debate about the ef fectiveness and long -term safety of certain vaccines, but its suggested alternative - HP - that is a perfect storm of controversy. Some homeopaths are not against vaccination itself, as it is based on a very similar concept to homeopathy, yet raise conce rns about possible long -term side -effects caused by toxic substances used in vaccines, such as aluminium oxide. Most homeopaths do not give direct advice on vaccinations. They recommend that patients discuss vaccination with their GP as well as specialist organisations that can provide information about the pro and cons of vaccination, so the patient can make an informed choice. But it must also be acknowledged that some other h omeopaths are obstinately against vaccination and embrace all sorts of alternati ves. They will not move from that position. They perceive vaccine damage as being a common occurrence in daily practice. They also point to the positive evidence suggested by HP programs. But some take it further, lazily making maverick statements and clai ms for which there is no credible evidence and going head to head with government agencies. This book will assist in understanding what can and cannot be claimed, what research has been undertaken to date, and what the gaps are in the research. Then ther e are those who shy away from the HP debate because of its red hot inflammatory reaction from the conventional medical profession. It needs to be understood that HP puts medical homeopaths in an unenviable position. As vaccination and homoprophylaxis are so politically sensitive, they often seek to minimise any discussion on these topics in the media. For those medical homeopaths that a bsolutely recommended the vaccination schedule and are actively against HP this book will also provide food for thought. But as well as homeopaths, sceptics and critics of homeopathy would benefit from reading and exploring Isaac's research. Equally lazy statements about homeopathy having no credible research can no longer be sustained in the light vi of the latest developments in robust, high -end research into homeopathy found here. Further, the media need it for when they weigh into the debate. Pro and anti -vaccination networks need it to establish some clarity on just what each side is saying. Bureaucrats in regulatory settin gs in the halls of government need it. And professional organizations representing homeopathy and complementary medicine need it. Policy decisions need to be made and these tend to fall on the extremely conservative side. Homeopathy as a whole, and advoca tes of homoprophylaxis have benefited significantly from the results of recent research that suggest that it may be effective in countering epidemic disease. In this work, Isaac explores the unqualified success of an HP intervention programme led by Dr Br acho in Cuba in 2007, which involved a homeopathic medicine being given to 2.3 million people at high risk of infection with the potentially fatal disease Leptospirosis. The results suggest that the homeopathic medicine lead to a \"drastic reduction\" in the number of cases of the disease, \"resulting in complete control of the epidemic.\" This study was carried out by the Finlay Institute - a company with decades of experience in the development and production of conventional vaccines. This evidence, coupled w ith Isaac's own research in the field of HP for children's infectious diseases make a compelling case for more exploration. This book explores history, theory, philosophy, opinion and research. There is immense value in Isaac sharing his experience. But i n addition, he has spent decades now collating and drilling down into the data. His personal experience and insights are set against the research publications and academic work he has engaged in. It is important to have such clear statements about what HP is and isn't. From the opening paragraph the language used is careful and accurate. The debate is also placed in its historical context. I value that the time has been taken to explore the historical roots and application of HP. I find it intriguing to lea rn that the debate goes to the origins, to understand that HP was first employed in 1798 and vaccination in 1796. Yet while measured in the most part, there is also a resilient position and a line drawn in the sand. There are some big statements too. HP in Isaac's or a skilled homeopaths hands may have 'provided unambiguous safety', and his research points to this, but homeopathy is not a level playing field. Within countries like Australia and certainly worldwide there are clearly different levels of proficiency in practice and understanding and application of the theory of homeopathic medicine. In fact in the application of HP there have been some scary practices that have done nothing but harm to homeopathy in pushing the debate forward. Isaac has str ong opinions. Not everyone agrees. On the one hand, Isaac is not shy from butting heads with Professor George Vithoulkas or Dr Peter Fisher who don't share his views from within the homeopathic community. Some homeopaths recommend that patients follow the recommended vaccination schedule, unless it is contra -indicated. Nor is he backward from taking on The Complete Practitioner 's Manual of Homoprophylaxis vii interviewers on Chanel 10 breakfast television in Australia. Moreover he is fine going up against medical professors and sceptics. In doing so, some homeopat hic scholars and academics might disagree with his interpretation and emphasis of homeopathic history. In addition, he advocates empowering parents. Some public health officials in the halls of power would counter that parents don't have the capacity or sk ills to untangle the issues and that public servants are in the best seat to determine protection against epidemic disease. In his protocol he uses high potencies in the main. Not all homeopaths would agree. The challenge with protocols, even within natu ral medicine settings is that they are designed for the normal person, but where is that person, and do they exist? Often I have been asked to provide remedies for travel or domestic HP and have provide d them along with the relevant literature, but I conti nue to get calls and emails about management issues; what to do for this acute or that drama that has come along and intervened in the process. What is clear about Isaac is that politics don't matter so much. Isaac is a follower of the Truth. That vaccina tion is a modern sacrament of modern medicine is no grounds for leaving it alone because it might court controversy or hot media attention. For him, in truth there is clarity and simplicity. Ultimately this is an important book for more than just practit ioners, but proponents of and opponents of homeopathy. The debate about vaccination is so emotionally laden. Those who are \"pro\" accuse those who are \"anti \" of killing babies by leaving them unprotected. Those who are \"anti\" accuse those who are \"pro\" of ruining the chronic health of entire populations. No one who passionately cares about health (and both sides of the debate do) want s to hear this. The only w ay forward is through dialogue, research and unemotional observation of the evidence. This work takes us firmly in that direction. Isaac explains the theoretical and conceptual framework of the hom oprophylactic approach. He provides the historical conte xt. He discusses the observable data. The conclusion is clear - based upon this body of work, more research into the long -term effects of conventional vaccines and the effectiveness of potential homeopathic alternatives is essential .

STYLE NOTES: 1. From now on, homoprophylaxis will usually be referred to as HP. 2. The H arvard system of referencing will be used, where the name of the author and the year of publication will be referred to, with full details provided in the Bibliography at the end of the book. 3. I have chosen to use the following spellings ; homeopathy and homoprophylaxis . Although not my purpose, I know this will irritate both those who prefer the American spelling using \" eo\" and those who prefer the traditional European spelling \" o\" consistently in both words. I prefer \" o\" but recognise that this is fading from common usage, so I have compromised. Further, I know that some believe that we should use \" eo\" when Nosodes are used and \" o\" when genus epidemicus remedies are used for prophylaxis. I won't pursue this debate further in this book as my programs co ntain both types of remedies and so consistent use of either option will still be regarded as incorrect . May I ask that you mentally substitute your preference where appropriate? The Complete Practitioner 's Manual of Homoprophylaxis ix Preface The title is both pretentious, and has dual meaning. I hope that this work will describe all there is to be known about homoprophylaxis (HP), thus making it complete. I have been using and researching HP for nearly 30 years and this book is an attempt to record that knowledge and pass it on to others. I also believe that a practitioner needs to be fully aware of what HP has to offer to be a complete practitioner (especially a homeopathic practitioner). I am not saying that they n eed to agree with, or personally use HP, o nly that they need to understand the principles and practices of the method and the choices which HP offers parents who are deciding whether to protect their children against targeted infectious diseases, and what options are available . It seems with hindsight that part of my dharma (or purpose) this life has been to try to support one part of Hahnemann's homeopathy that has been accepted by some, but greatly neglected and indeed shunned by other members of the international homeopathic community. I believe this has largely been due to a combination of ignorance and fear, and the proven way of dispelling both is by providing factual information. And that is the clear purpose of this book - to fully explain what HP is, its history , and how to use the method in practice for both short -term and long-term prevention (Chapters 1 -4); its proven and measured safety and effectiveness (Chapters 5 and 6); as well as to address various philosophical considerations about HP (Chapter 7); and finally to suggest a mechanism of action (Chapter 8) . A brie f Appendix comparing vaccination and homoprophylaxis is included . This Manual is principally a resource for health practitioners from any modality, not just homeopaths , but of course may be of value to others with a deep interest in the topic. It is also intended to be a reference book for students of homeopathy who often receive inadequate training in HP. x Introduction I began clinical practice in 1984. I came to this with awareness that vaccination had the potential to cause damage to recip ients due to the experience with one of my own children. I had no idea that homeopathic medicine had anything to offer in terms of (a) treating vaccine damage, and (b) eliminating the need to vaccinate by providing an historically tested method of infectio us disease prevention. When I first read Hahnemann's article describing his experience with both treating and preventing scarlet fever I was very excited, as well as disappointed that I had not been taught this during my studies. I knew, as a parent, ther e was a need to offer p arents an option to vaccination and now saw that homeopathic medicine offered this option. I collected all the references that I could about HP, which were very few indeed given that I had no access to old journal articles. But an e xcellent little booklet by Sankaran summarising the experience of around 100 practitioners (Sankaran P, 1961), plus some references in the writings of Hahnemann, Kent and Boenninghausen, among others, gave me confidence to proceed. I released my first 5 -year HP program in 1985 /86. It was unashamedly intended to be a direct alternative to the then current vaccination program in Australia. My early training in economics and statistics proved to me the need for objective data -based research in this area and w as invaluable in conducting t his ongoing research . So accompanying the instructions for how to use the HP program was a questionnaire for parents to complete concerning their child's experience with the program. The accumulating responses to the question naire have formed the basis for progressive articles and books which I have written on the topic since 1986, when my very first article appeared in Nature & Health magazine in Australia (Golden , 1986). The first edition of my main book for parents then tit led Vaccination: A Review of Risks and Alternatives was published in 1989 (Go lden, 1989). Successive editions and rewrites of this book appeared up to the 5th. In 2005 I published the 6th edition , which involved a total re -write and restructuring of the book, with a slightly different emphasis that was reflected in the new title, Vaccination & Homoprophylaxis ? A Review of Risks and Alternatives. It was updated in 2007 (Golden, 2007b). This The Complete Practitioner 's Manual of Homoprophylaxis xi followed my Doctoral research into HP at Swinburne University in Melbourne from 2000 to 2004. The 7th edition was released in 2010 and involved a comprehensive updating of references plus the inclusion of data from the Cuban HP interventions. This research also informed the changes I made to the program in 1993, 2004 a nd 2012 which are di scussed in Chapter 4 . These days I call for the implementation of a dual system of immunisation, where parents are f ree to choose between vaccination and HP . Ideally, the choice of either immunisation option would be supported by orthodox authorities. It has been a long, interesting and challenging journey. I have been opposed and investigated by the orthodox authorities in Australia, and questioned by colleagues within the homeopathic community. I have also received numerous letters and emails from grateful parents who are overjoyed and relieved that a safe and relatively effective alternative to vaccination exists. So I now come to this new book: my aim is to offer to homeopaths as w ell as practitioners from any modality, including orthodox practitioners, my accumulated experience into how to design a structured homoprophylaxis program for short or long term prevention of targeted infectious diseases. Two points need to be made clea r from the beginning : 1. Nothing on the planet can guarantee 100% protection against infectiou s diseases. Vaccination doesn't; homoprophylaxis doesn't; and even getting the infectious disease once doesn't ensure that a person won' t become infected a second t ime. 2. There is no such thing as homeopathic vaccination . Homeopaths do not vaccinate , but we do offer a method of immunising against future infections . Homeopathic immunisation (or homoprophylaxis ) is not an attempt to mimic the vaccination pathway. It is a completely different and unique method of reducing the likelihood of developing the symptoms of an infectious disease if exposed to it. Vaccination was first used by Dr Edward Jenner in 1796. Homoprophylaxis was first used by Dr Samuel Hahnemann (the f ounder of homeopathy ) in 1798. xii The two methods were developed independently of each other. Vaccination is currently a huge money earner for orthodox practitioners and particularly for pharmaceutical companies. It is literally a billion dollar business. Homoprophylaxis offers very modest returns for both practitioners and homeopathic pharmacies. Possibly the differences in financial returns explain why one is much more commonly used than another. But economic considerations are not central to this work. Homoprophylaxis has an unambiguous history of providing a strong level of protection, and a clear record of long -term safety. It is controversial, but this is mainly because it is not well understood, including by some teachers of homeopathy . The p urpose of this book is to provide clear and proven d irection of how to implement both short -term and long -term homoprophylaxis programs. It is a practical book, but also covers the main conceptual and philosophical aspects of the immunisation decision.
