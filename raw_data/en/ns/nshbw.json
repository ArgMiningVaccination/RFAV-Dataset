At one point, I saw a patient in the office and diagnosed him with a minor illness requiring no treatment. Later, I checked my EMR and there in front of me was the sick-ening truth that I had made a mistake. He had presented to emergency the night before with a life-threatening illness. Much to my relief the patient didn't die, but he could have. I imme-diately felt guilt, remorse, shame, and self-doubt accompanied by a chest pain and a sinking feeling in my ab-domen. I was flooded with negativity. How could I have been so careless? I'm a terrible physician! Why didn't I take the time to listen and make the correct diagnosis? Maybe I should tell all of my patients to find a physician worthy of them? The visceral mal - aise and cognitive despair was over - whelming. There was no escape from it in the days that followed\u2014it was there when I closed my eyes at night, in the morning when I woke, and all the time in between. It is a struggle to deal with all the emotions associated with such a blunder while carrying on seeing patients. The experience got me thinking about how physicians deal with mis-takes. Doctors are human and, there-fore, fated to make errors during their careers. Fortunately, my mistake didn't lead to mortality or significant morbidity, but it could have. My heart goes out to physicians whose misdiag-noses led to significant adverse patient outcomes. I can't imagine the mental and physical stress involved (there by the grace of God go I). I confess that this isn't the first mistake I've made, and I'm sure it won't be my last. How-ever, enough time has passed that I've now reflected on the process I went through and thought I would share it in case it might help someone else. First, I talked to my wife and col- leagues, discussing my error and shar - ing my feelings. My wife, as always, supported me and reminded me of the many patients who would vouch for my care as a physician. My colleagues listened and shared their stories of medical woe, making me feel less alone. I carefully looked back at my encounter with the patient and thought about where things went wrong and what I could have done differently. What factors were involved, including mine, the patient's, and those of our therapeutic relationship? I was able to identify and take ownership of my part of the interaction, which led to my misdiagnosis. I then took the difficult step of phoning the patient and apolo-gizing for letting him down. This was not a pleasant process. He was justifi-ably angry, but I believe this step was necessary for me to move on and con-tinue to be an effective physician. As a result, with the passage of time, I have been able to put this experience in its proper place as an unpleasant memo-ry, but one I have learned from. The patient has come back to see me in the office, which I'm sure was a big step for him. He related that much of his disappointment and an-ger was tied up in the thought that he might not be around for his daughters. This was a sobering reminder to me of the lives that can be affected when we make errors in our profession. The challenge is to accept this reality without letting it paralyze us while we do our jobs and hopefully learn from our infrequent mistakes. \u2014DRReditorials info@pollockclinics.com 604-717-6200 www.pollockclinics.com Men's Sexual Health Program for your Patients with Erectile Dysfunction Shockwave Therapy - low intensity acoustic sound wave technology Platelet Rich Plasma Therapy (PRP Shot)Sex Therapy with a certified and experienced Sex Therapist No doctor referral is required.155 bc medical journal vol. 61 no. 4, may 2019 bcmj.org www.bcphysio.org | Toll NATIONAL PHYSIOTHERAPY MONTH The Physiotherapy Association of BC has been promoting the value of physiotherapy for nearly 75 years.

Proud Partner of Walk with Your Doc!156 bc medical journal vol. 61 no. 4, may 2019 bcmj.orgeditorials Observing the current federal and provincial political scenes makes one wonder why any- one would become a politician. The same question may be more valid when considering medical politics which, as Dr Pat McGeer implies, is more demanding and less well paid than the real thing. 1 Many of us have tried, without achieving the level of satis-factory outcomes that we hoped for. Major themes that our national and provincial medical organizations have focused on include physician health and burnout, and increased funding for seniors care and Phar - macare. However, when it comes to policy determinations, we have not followed the usual axioms in medi-cine, that prevention is better than cure, and that diagnosis and causation should usually precede treatment.Forty years ago, physician health problems and burnout were not so prev-alent. I suggest that this is in large part because, despite often working exhaus-tive hours, we were extremely happy with our work. We did not experience the frustrations of extreme rationing or the access issues of today. Physicians had an important and respected role in determining health policy. Who can argue against additional funding for seniors care? Well, as a senior, I can. I received a Gold Care Card from the BC government that afforded me greater health benefits based on age. Since two-thirds of Ca-nadians' wealth is held by those over 65, what sense does that make? Why should poor young families subsidize richer seniors? As Canada's popula-tion doubled between 1961 and 2017, per capita spending on health rose sixtyfold. Wealthy baby boomers will receive $4000 more care than their lifetime tax contributions fund. Mil - lennials and iGens will pay $18 000 to $27 000 more in taxes than benefits received. We are imposing long-term debt on our youth. 2 The emphasis on seniors is misguided. Low-income groups of all ages need adequate care and, as happened previously with fam-ily allowances, a means test is needed. Government Pharmacare is anoth- er ill-advised initiative. Private insur - ers (such as not-for-profit Blue Cross) already provide drug coverage for 70% of Canadians. A new costly bu-reaucracy will mean further rationing of existing services, and perhaps long lineups to see a pharmacist. If Phar - macare (and dentistry, physiothera - py, etc.) are to be added as benefits (and they should be), it should not be through an expanded bureaucracy but through funding or subsidizing pre-miums for those who lack coverage. Governments are inefficient at pro- viding services. Stats Canada data show the poor and underprivileged covered by government plans suffer the worst health access and outcomes. Indigenous health services are a prime example. Doctors are blamed for systemic weaknesses that governments have built into a rationing-based system. Provincial medical associations are hampered when it comes to confron-tation with their health ministry em-ployers, with whom they negotiate their own reimbursement. Collabora-tion may become a harmful synonym for appeasement. However, in poli-cy making, our national association should not fear confrontation when collaboration fails. Governments like to assign blame for cost overruns to \"overpaid\" phy-sicians. I recently paid $576 for a 30-minute house call to unblock a sewer drain. That's 6 or 7 times the fee for an equivalent family doctor visit; perhaps we need to consider teaching doctors to clear drains. An entity called Choosing Wisely often focuses on in-appropriate actions of doctors as a fac-tor in escalating costs. There are good aspects to their work, but in champion-ing it the CMA must protect the rights of patients and physicians. The group bases protocols on expert opinions and peer-reviewed studies, many of which are without merit. 3 Experts opine on inappropriate investigations or proce - dures, and I am aware that they some-times base their recommendations on inaccurate analyses. Like Feynman, I believe \"Science is the belief in the ig-norance of experts.\" 4 Clearly, not ev- eryone with a headache needs an MRI. But ask a patient whose symptoms did not fit a protocol but who benefit-ed from an early diagnosis that saved their life if their so-called inappropri - ate test was worthwhile. If I spend 45 minutes doing a complete physical and find a rectal tumor, was I not choos-ing wisely when I examined areas that were normal?

Physicians cannot be blamed for accessing what they consider appro-priate and available diagnostic tools. Choosing wisely must not violate the rights of patients to override the soci-etal directive or protocol and choose for themselves when their own health is involved. Finally, I am disappointed that the CMA, as the main sponsor of a recent Economic Club of Canada event titled \"Is It Time to Revisit the Canada Health Act?\" agreed to the assignment of our president as a moderator while three nonphysicians (some of whom blame physicians for our system's failings) espouse their opinions and recommendations. Our talented CMA president, Dr Gigi Os-ler, should have been front and centre as the main speaker at that event. Our professional bodies should not devi-ate from the principle that physicians should lead, rather than moderate, important discussions on the future of our health system. \u2014BD References 1.

The PCNs and UPCC will recruit approximate-ly 68 new health care providers over the next 3 years, including 10 general practitioners, 10 nurse practitioners, 3 clinical pharmacists, and 45 nursing and allied health care professionals. The three networks will be the Brentwood/Hastings PCN, Edmonds PCN, and Metrotown PCN. A fourth PCN located in the Lougheed region will be developed in the future. Currently, Burnaby has 45 pri- mary care clinics participating in the PCN and 133 general practitioners. The networks will partner new and existing health care professionals with the health authority and com-munity organizations as part of a networked, team-based approach to providing care. The Burnaby Urgent and Pri- mary Care Centre, located in the Edmonds PCN, is the sixth centre to be announced in BC. The centre will open in two phases. The first phase offers extended hours evenings and weekends and will increase access to team-based care for a range of primary-care needs. In the second phase, the centre will host an incu - bator clinic to support experienced family physicians in mentoring new family physicians, consolidate nurs-ing and allied health resources, and work to attach people in need of reg-ular primary care. In addition, once fully devel- oped, the Metrotown PCN will also form a Centre for Healthy Commu-nities that will support an incubator clinic. Centres for Healthy Com-munities are hubs for co-location of practitioner, health authority, and community services and resources. They will serve as the focal points in the PCN to anchor, integrate, and support services and providers to serve the entire neighborhood. The three PCNs will focus on the specific needs of the community and improve health services identified as high priority for each community, including: Enhanced access to regular, ex-tended, and after-hours services for comprehensive primary care. Improved access to primary-care services for priority populations in-cluding seniors and immigrants. Team-based resources to better meet the needs of low- to moderate- complexity patients requiring spe-cialized services including for frail seniors and mental health and ad-dictions. The PCNs will operate in close partnership and collaboration with the Division of Family Practice and Fraser Health primary care networks being implemented in Fraser North-west communities. The Ministry of Health will pro- vide approximately $12 million in an-nual operating funding to the Burnaby networks and UPCC by the third year, as new positions are added and patients are attached.

For example, divisions of family practice and medical staff associations focus on issues that are most important to a particular community or facility. Sec- tions help represent doctors in certain areas of practice on matters such as fees, policies, and guidelines. But as much as I encourage everyone to become involved in the groups that work on their behalf\u2014whether by simply joining or by doing something more\u2014and as much as these organi-zations should address barriers to in-volvement, the choice to participate must be voluntary. For example, un-like for most doctors in Canada, being a member of your provincial medical association is your decision in BC, and whether or not you become (or stay) a Doctors of BC member doesn't af-fect your ability to practise medicine in the province. And just as I encour - age you to join your division, medical staff association, or section and sup - port the work they do, this too should be your decision. The same argument applies to societies and to the CMA, with whom we ended our mandatory conjoint membership earlier this year. Conversely, just as it is your choice to join an organization, the onus is on the organization to tell you what they do and to prove to you their value.This is a fragile, uneasy time. Unstable markets, privacy breaches, and politicians who treat nuclear codes and human rights like the plot lines of a reality TV show have all created a collective unease. In health care, we're seeing soaring costs due to bureaucracy, increased needs, and innovations in investiga - tion and treatment. What resources we do have are further stretched by preventable outbreaks of disease due to vaccine misinformation, the re-placement of nutrition by a supple-ment industry worth billions, 1 and mistrust in medication due to Big Pharma scandals. 2 Professionally, doctors also feel un- der threat. Scope creep, overregulation, and antagonistic relationships with government and administrators have left many distrustful and wounded. So is it any wonder that in the face of uncertainty many have chosen to turn inward? There is comfort in be-ing with one's own kind, who will protect you, and populist leaders have quickly played to this fear by blaming those who are different\u2014sometimes even creating or accentuating those differences. Though these walls may be literal or figurative, and may even produce short-lived change, they do not lead to lasting positive gains. As doctors, we are at risk to pop- ulism due to our heterogeneity. We work in urban, suburban, and rural locations. We are based in communi-ties and/or facilities. Some of us re - fer, some consult, some do both. For historical reasons, those of us trained in Canada belong to one of two Col-leges. Some are early in their career, some are at the end, and a lot are in be-tween. We have varied backgrounds and beliefs.Doctors of BC, your medi-cal association, is made up of members. Full stop. Sections, societies, divis- ions, and medi-cal staff associa-tions are some of the organizations with which we have working relation-ships, some outlined in the Doctors of BC Bylaws and some through the Physician Master Agreement. And as your organization is the only one that speaks for all doctors in the province, I hope that Doctors of BC will con-tinue to earn your trust and advocate for you as best we can to support you in your profession and personal lives. Thank you for choosing to read this. Thank you for choosing to be a member of Doctors of BC. Though the future is uncertain, our best chance is to face it united. We need a stronger community rather than more tribes. And when you decide to reject populist rhetoric, you choose a future that is Better Together. \u2014Eric Cadesky, MDCM, CCFP, FCFP Doctors of BC President References 1. Brodwin E.

In fact, ayruvedic herbal medicine has been well documented to contain toxic lead levels. 1,2 The BCCDC article serves as a reminder of the importance of in-quiring into a patient's use of comple-mentary and alternative medicine as an integral part of history taking. The use of ayruvedic medicine and po-tential lead poisoning can be readily identified, and that identification may have saved many emergency room visits, medical visits, and extensive investigations in this patient's case. Ayruvedic herbal medicine from India and Chinese herbal medicine are the two most common complementary and alternative medicines that may contain lead and other heavy metals. In addition, some children's costume jewelry has been reported as an un-usual source of toxic lead exposure. 3 \u2014H.C. George Wong, MD, FRCPC Vancouver References 1. Gair R.

I would, however, question his conclusion that \"there are more accidental overdoses and deaths. . .\" attributed to the legal - ization of cannabis. His reference for this statement 1 mentions a single death due to myocarditis in an 11-month-old who tested positive for THC. In a Washington Post article 2 about that case, the child was said to be in an \"unstable motel-living situation\" with parents who admitted to multiple drug possessions, including marijuana. No causal relationship was suggested in the case report3 described in that article, and the death was attributed to myocarditis, not marijuana expos-ure. 2 In fact, authors of the case report noted, \"As of this writing, this is the first reported pediatric death associ-ated with cannabis exposure.\" 2 Also in the article, \"Nappe emphasized that the word 'associated' should not be interpreted as indicating a cause and effect.\" 2 I would also question the conclusion that cannabis legalization has led to more overdoses. Certainly legalization has been associated with more reported overdoses, but this could reflect willingness of parents to report accidental exposure because of decriminalization. \u2014Mike Figurski, MD, CA-CPHIMS Colorado, 2009-2015.

In addressing conflicts of fiduciary duty, we have increased confidence that Board members have clear priorities. And allowing more time for reflection in RA meetings will further define roles and provide our leaders with more re- sources and experiences. This is all part of the RA's evolution to be your voice for complementary interests in the mo-saic that is our organization. The year ahead promises to be im- portant, with patient medical homes, primary/patient care networks, im-plementation of the next phases of the PMA, a possible verdict in the Cam-bie legal challenge, and further col-laboration with the Canadian Medical Association, government, health au-thorities, the University of British Co-lumbia, and the College of Physicians and Surgeons. Changes in society and the practice of medicine make for un-certain times, but under the leadership of incoming president Dr Kathleen Ross we are in good hands. She un-derstands the stresses we endure and the importance of professional unity in the face of identity politics. Doctors of BC staff support us tremendously, and often in ways that go unnoticed, so on behalf of us all I thank our adept CEO Allan Seckel and the rest of the staff who do their work so well so we can do ours.Maybe it's the acoustic cover of \"Despacito\" playing the background. Maybe it's the late-night cuddles I received before opening my laptop. Maybe it's the solemn knowledge that this is likely the last thing I will write in the BCMJ as your president. Whatever the cause, I am in a reflective mood as I con-sider everything that we have accom-plished together this year. The most significant is the new Physician Master Agreement (PMA) that, in conjunction with our respect-ful and collaborative relationship with government, set new standards of recognition for the burdens that doc-tors carry and the supports we need to provide optimum care. We all owe a heartfelt thank you to the Statutory Negotiating Committee and its chair, Dr Trina Larsen Soles, as well as to our chief negotiator, Mr Paul Stras-zak, and the staff that advocated for us so well. As a result of this agree-ment our profession is positioned to continue caring and advocating for the health of our patients, our com - munities, and our colleagues. Despite these tribal times when other leaders threatened walls and closed borders, we came together over honest, difficult, sensitive conversa-tions on how to create a Doctors of BC that respects diversity, encourag-es inclusion, and promotes belonging. You told us about your experiences in different settings: these stories inform us as we move ahead on ensuring that all voices are heard and that everyone feels safe. This is not easy, but worthy journeys rarely are. This year we continued settling into our new governance structure.

You are brilliant, dedi - cated, and inspiring. Doctors of BC is made of members. You are Doctors of BC. And we are better because of it. It has been my honor to serve you. You may not have always agreed with what I said or how I said it, but, as I promised at the beginning of my term, I tried as hard as I could to represent you. I look forward to continuing this advocacy because no matter our dif-ferences on a particular issue, we are all on the same team caring for the same patients in the same health care system.

This problem is manifest in the inability to reproduce evidence on repeated randomized clinical trials (RCTs). Theoretically, an RCT is the way to answer questions about which treatments are useful, but practically, an RCT is too expen-sive to conduct with enough patients to get answers to such questions. There are three fundamental prob- lems with statistics. First, in 2005 John Ioannidis wrote what is now very well cited paper in PLOS Med entitled, \"Why most published re-search findings are false.\" 1 In the ar - ticle he likened medical research to a large RCT machine with three dials that can be conservatively set to show that medical research is 95% wrong. The first dial shows how many more false hypotheses there are than true ones. The second dial shows how un-derpowered studies are. The third dial shows how much published results are flooded with false positives. 2* Second, there are very precise im- pressive algebraic statements made about the bell-shaped curve. These statements have names like variance and confidence intervals. These state - ments simply tell us how uncertain we are about the average treatment value we measure from the data generated from our experiments compared to the real treatment value we would have if we had all the data, which we rarely do. Furthermore, biology rarely con-forms to a bell-shaped curve. 3 This means that all those impressive alge - braic statements about how uncertain we are about our treatment are com-pletely and absolutely meaningless. Third, probability theory was orig- inally developed for nothing more than winning at games of chance. Origina- tors of this theory \u00a7 only cared if cards were dealt fairly and unpredictably to the players. There was no assumption of any random process going on. This leads to normative statements. Norma-tive statements are very strange for a scientific enterprise. You can say that a full house beats two of a kind. That's true, because this is an \"is\" state - ment. However, the statement that you should not draw to an inside straight is a normative statement, which is an \"ought\" statement. And you cannot get an ought from an is. || Luckily there are three improve- ments taking place. First, you can now preregister a study with a repu-table journal that does not charge a fee for publication (some regrettably do). If accepted, and as long as you follow your protocol, the study will be published whether the results are positive, negative, or indifferent. Second, people are discussing cognitive biases more openly. There is now a large body of published work in the fields of evolutionary psychol-ogy and behavioral economics that basically says the world does not run on rationality. Hundreds of these bi-ases are now catalogued. However, the obvious which-drug-company-is-paying-for-dinner cognitive bias usually isn't discussed. This means that which treatments get promoted are still, to a large extent, based on marketing. Third, there is now a causal rev- olution underway in statistics. 4 The statistical language of science is very different from the cause-and-effect language that the human brain uses. As we came out of the trees and onto the plains of Africa, a part of our brains that had evolved to detect pat-terns in nature was co-opted to detect cause and effect. These early mon-keys with big brains realized that A was followed by B and that one could manipulate A to change B. The math-ematicians who developed statistics in the early 1900s did away with cause and effect so as to deal only with correlations because it made the math easier. There are now well- established causal inference tools that will help researchers make predic-tive statements from descriptive data alone. Hopefully this credibility problem will improve. Hopefully our academ-ic institutions will be more upfront Dr Elliott is a staff anesthesiologist at Provi- dence Healthcare in Vancouver.Mark Elliott, MD, FRCPC The statistical language of science is very different from the cause-and-effect language that the human brain uses. 163 bc medical journal vol. 61 no. 4, may 2019 bcmj.orgpremise CIBC WOOD GUNDY Peter Leacock has provided thoughtful investment advice to doctors and their families for the past 20 years.

He has over 5 million subscrib-ers to his YouTube channel, Veritasium, which produces science videos. A bell-shaped curve is also known as a normal distribution or a Gaussian distri-bution. If you go out two standard devia-tions from either side of the mean you account for 95% of the events, leaving only 2.5% in each of the tails of this type of statistical distribution. This is well described with mathematics, but the mathematics is only an approximation. It is a good approximation but not perfect. Physicians are usually quite in awe of all this math and tend never to question the underlying assumptions. But math is just another language, like English or French or any other language. The lan-guage of math is pretty good for physics but terrible for biology. There is a statistical distribution made fa- mous by Nassim Nicholas Taleb's book The Black Swan. It is a distribution that is just a little lower in the centre and just a little higher in the tails. So all the action is now in the tails. If one overlays a fat-tailed distribution on top of a Gaussian distribution one can barely make out the difference by eye. But the probabil-ity of an event 10 standard deviations from the mean (a 10 sigma event) is one in a trillion in the Gaussian (remember the 2008 financial crisis apologists) but one in a hundred in the fat-tail distribu-tion. This means there is a nine orders of magnitude change in those precise algebraic statements that tell us how uncertain we are about our measure-ments. Human brains have difficulty un-derstanding such exponential changes. For example, a six order of magnitude change would be buying a $2 million house in Vancouver for $2. Distributions for systems in which many variables are interacting (like in biology) probably fol-low an asymmetrical distribution called the Tracy-Widom distribution. If this is the distribution underlying our science, then those statements of uncertainty are not just orders of magnitude wrong, but simply meaningless. \u00a7 One of the pioneers in this field was a physician named Gerolamo Cardano (1501-1576) whose book Liber de Ludo Aleae (The Book on Games of Chance) includes a chapter on cheating. || This ought-from-an-is debate has been going on for hundreds of years. At the start of the scientific revolution, David Hume wrote about it extensively. Yet despite this underlying philosophical paradox in probability theory, probabil-ity has taken over vast areas of human endeavor such as the actuarial science used by the insurance industry and the Black Scholes model of pricing finan-cial derivatives (and we know how that turned out in 2008).164 bc medical journal vol. 61 no. 4, may 2019 bcmj.orgJulian Marsden, MD, Sharla Drebit, MSc, Chantel Archibald, Riyad B. MD, MHSc, Kim Eggers, Kendall Ho, MD, Afshin Khazei, MD, Adam Lund, MD, MEd, Ed Martin, BA, Jim Christenson, MD The BC Emergency Medicine Network: Evaluation approach and early findings A review of membership and online engagement data and an analysis of survey and interview results provide valuable insights for those interested in creating and improving clinical networks that support practitioners. ABSTRACT Background: Clinical networks have been found to provide benefits such as better and more standardized pa-tient care and greater satisfaction for practitioners. In September 2017 the BC Emergency Medicine Network (EM Network) was launched to help practitioners deliver the best care. The EM Network's website was de-veloped to provide individual prac-titioners with access to clinical resources, research and innovation initiatives, continuing professional development, and real-time support. Since surprisingly little is known about how clinical networks are best structured and developed, the plans for the EM Network included an early evaluation process to document and guide growth. Methods: Overall function of the EM Network after 1 year of operation was evaluated by analyzing mem-bership and online engagement data and by conducting an online quanti-tative survey and subsequent quali-tative interviews to obtain member feedback. Google Maps, Google An-alytics, and Twitter Analytics were used, as well as PARTNER (Program to Analyze, Record, and Track Net-works to Enhance Relationships), a validated social network analysis tool. The BC Ethics Harmonization Initiative advised that formal ethics approval was not needed because the study fits within a quality im-provement framework. Results: During the study period, the EM Network consisted of 622 of 1400 eligible members (44%) from 79 of 108 emergency care sites in BC (73%). Each month an average of 999 active users visited the website. While survey respondents indicated the EM Network is credible and re-spected, many were unaware of its purpose and offerings. Averaged scores for the perceptions of sur - vey respondents regarding three network values (power/influence, involvement, resource contribution) ranged from 2.36 to 2.52, with 3.00 being considered good. When survey respondents were asked if they felt supported in their work by the Net-work, the majority said they felt \"sup-ported\" or \"somewhat supported.\" Conclusions: Our findings highlight the need for early evaluation after a network is launched to identify development needs. While our re-sults must be interpreted cautiously because the EM Network is young, membership and online engagement data and member feedback indicate we need to increase awareness of offerings and encourage more on-line dialogue. Regular re-evaluation is planned to monitor progress and strengthen this initiative.

Background The benefits of clinical networks are numerous and include better and more standardized patient care and less stress and more satisfaction for practitioners. In some situations, net-works can eliminate the need to trans-fer patients to a higher level of care and thus can reduce costs and ensure continued local availability of ambu-lance crews for other patients. In September 2017 the BC Emer - gency Medicine Network (EM Net-work) was launched to support the delivery of evidence-informed, patient-centred care in all 108 emer - gency departments (EDs) and diag-nostic and treatment centres in BC. 1 The EM Network operates under the oversight of a Management Team and an Advisory Committee that includes patient partners. Through the EM Network website (www.bcemergency network.ca), individual practitioners can access resources and services in four functional programs: clinical resources, research and innovation, continuing professional development, and real-time support. These publicly accessible resources are designed to facilitate communication, physician engagement, patient engagement, and evaluation to achieve the EM Net-work's vision: \"Exceptional emergen-cy care. Everywhere.\" 2 As well, the website features a secure area where members can engage with other mem-bers in a discussion forum and access the member directory. Accessing the secure area requires approval by EM Network management to obtain a user name and password. Together, the publicly accessible and secure parts of the website provide members with a practical point-of-care tool. For example, if an emer - gency practitioner is working alone and a patient presents with a condi - tion seen rarely or not seen before by the practitioner, the practitioner can quickly access a brief synopsis of the condition (e.g., symptomatic atrial fibrillation) and its management in the form of a two-page summary or a 5-minute video. In future, if more help is needed, the practitioner will be able to connect synchronously with anoth-er practitioner in BC and be guided through the management of the con-dition virtually, which in the case of symptomatic atrial fibrillation might include electrical cardioversion. This technology-supported component of the EM Network for peer-to-peer cli - nician support has been piloted in one location and is still in development. Although networks, including clinical networks, are recognized as important for disseminating infor - mation and standardizing evidence-informed care, surprisingly little is known about how they are best struc-tured and developed. 3-6 Knowing that we need to learn more about what makes networks suc-cessful, the challenges networks face, the evolution of a network life cycle, and the best strategies for success, 4,7-13 we included a formative evaluation in the design of the EM Network to as-sess overall network function. Our intention was to document early suc-cesses and obtain baseline data for fu-ture evaluations and to guide growth and improve the EM Network. methods Overall function of the EM Network was evaluated regarding member - ship, online engagement, and member 166 bc medical journal vol. 61 no. 4, may 2019 bcmj.orgThe BC Emergency Medicine Network: Evaluation approach and early findings perceptions of value and progress.

Membership in the EM Network is currently restricted to BC physicians practising in an emergency care setting with the exception of EM Network management staff, patient partners, and a few out-of-province content contributors. Members were plotted by primary hospital site using Google Maps. Members were classi-fied as rural if their primary place of practice was considered rural by the BC Ministry of Health's Rural Prac-tice Subsidiary Agreement, which evaluates each community on its level of isolation. 14 Online engagement To determine how many users, both EM Network members and nonmem-bers, were accessing the website and their frequency of use, data from 1 September 2017 to 31 August 2018 were analyzed using Google Ana - lytics. Users were defined as having a unique IP address. To measure the online engage- ment of members, we analyzed the number of posts and replies in the members-only discussion forum. Ad-ditonally, we analyzed Twitter activ-ity using Twitter Analytics to gain a broader understanding of how users interact with the EM Network. member feedback Member feedback was obtained through an online survey and individ-ual interviews. This component of the EM Network's evaluation framework was developed based on literature recommendations 15-18 and in collab- oration with EM Network members and patient partners. In February and March 2018, a quantitative survey was conducted using PARTNER (Program to Ana - lyze, Record, and Track Networks to Enhance Relationships), a validated social network analysis tool devel-oped though an evaluation of over 150 community networks. 19 The PART - NER tool maps who is connected to whom, and provides a visual repre - sentation of the number and qual-ity of relationships, the trust between partners, the value each partner brings to the relationship, resource contribu-tions, and the roles that each partner plays. The tool requires one respon-dent per site or organization to answer questions, so one member from each of the emergency departments with members at the time of the study was invited to participate, thus ensuring a balanced geographic distribution and an appropriate rural/urban mix, with a rural site defined as a primary hospi-tal in a community with a population of less than 10 000. 20 In order to mini- mize bias, EM Network Management Team members and Advisory Com-mittee members were not eligible to participate. The survey was adminis-tered first to 77 members and a second time to 57 different members using the same selection strategy in order to increase the sample size. In both cas-es, survey respondents were invited via email and were sent three remind-ers. In total, 46 members responded. The two data sets were merged prior to analysis. For the purposes of the PARTNER survey, any redundancies were removed to achieve only one response per site, as the software is only able to recognize one response per site. Twenty-one respondents to the quantitative survey were then asked to indicate whether they were willing to have a follow-up semi-structured interview. Both purposive and ran-dom sampling techniques were used to ensure a balanced geographic dis - tribution and an appropriate rural/urban mix when selecting the 21 sub-jects. Survey respondents who had not completed the survey or only partially completed the survey were included in the interview invitation process in an effort to minimize selection bias. Results The analysis of membership and on - line engagement data indicated that after 1 year the EM Network had members throughout the province and a multitude of active users of the website. The analysis of survey data indicated members perceive the Net-work to be credible and have a small to fair amount of overall value, while interview results indicated a general lack of awareness of the Network's purpose and function. membership On 31 August 2018, membership in the EM Network stood at 622 of ap-proximately 1400 eligible physicians (44%), and these members were prac-tising at 79 of 108 emergency care sites (73%) throughout BC, as shown in Figure 1 . Looking at the rural/ urban mix, 54% were from urban sites and 46% from rural sites. Online engagement From 1 September 2017 to 31 Au-gust 2018, 11 154 individuals with a unique IP address accessed the EM Network website. Figure 2 shows that 999 users, on average, visited the site each month and 136 web pages were viewed each day. Users accessed the website from British Columbia (61%), other sites in Canada (12%), 167 bc medical journal vol. 61 no. 4, may 2019 bcmj.orgThe BC Emergency Medicine Network: Evaluation approach and early findings and outside of Canada (27%). In the members-only discussion forum, 27 topics were posted, with 9 of these coming from EM Network manage-ment, and 94 replies were posted, with 29 coming from EM Network man-agement. Most posts (78%) received at least one reply. The most popular discussion topics concerned oper - ational/administration issues, cardio-vascular conditions, and toxicology. It is important to note that interac - tion also occurred outside the online discussion forum. At the end of the study, the EM Network had over 550 Twitter followers. During the study, the EM Network received an aver - age of 27 \"mentions\" on Twitter per month, 581 \"impressions\" per day (the number of times the EM Net - work's Tweets are seen by others), and two \"likes\" per day. member feedback A questionnaire was emailed to 134 EM Network members selected from across the province, and responses were received from 46 (34%). Re-spondents were asked about the EM Network's progress in achieving its goals in each of the four program areas: clinical resources, research and innovation, continuing professional development, and real-time support. When asked if they could usually find what they were searching for on the EM Network website, 58% said they could and the remaining 42% answered \"not applicable.\" Respond-ents felt progress had been made in the following areas: Development of a structure to share clinical and operational solutions and tools (33%). Fulfillment of the vision and mis-sion of the EM Network (31%). Dissemination of important knowl-edge for critical decision making through continuing professional de-velopment (11%).Figure 1.

Respondents indicated that prog- ress was less evident in other areas: Integration of continuing profes-sional development opportunities to acquire and maintain necessary EM skills such as increased simulation program capacity (5%). Implementation of real-time sup-port (5%). System innovation (5%). Clinical resources knowledge trans-lation (2%). PARTNER software 19 was used to diagram the whole EM Network based on respondent perceptions, as shown in Figure 3 , which used a baseline set of indicators to depict the EM Network in its early phase of development. Each urban and rural node represents an ED or diagnos-tic and treatment centre with at least one emergency practitioner. These are shown along with nodes for external organizations that emergency practi -tioners contact regularly: BC Ambu-lance Service, BC Patient Transfer Network, Emergency Physician On-line Support, BC Drug and Poison Information Centre, Rapid Access to Consultative Expertise, and STARS (Shock Trauma Air Rescue Service). Lines on the diagram indicate connec-tions between sites and organizations. Although the location of the nodes in the diagram does not signify value, the size of each node does. The larger the node the more value respondents perceived that site or organization to have. Value was measured using a combined score for level of pow-er/influence, level of involvement, and level of resource contribution. Figure 4 shows averaged scores for these three values, which were rated by survey respondents as 1 (no value), 2 (a small amount), 3 (a fair amount), or 4 (a great deal), with scores of 3 and higher being considered good. When surveyed, subjects were asked if they felt more supported by the EM Network, and of the 22 sur - vey respondents who completed that question, most indicated they felt \"supported\" or \"somewhat support-ed,\" as shown in Figure 5 . Of 21 members then invited to take part in semi-structured inter - views, 16 (76%) participated. When all comments were analyzed, five concerns emerged: 1. General lack of awareness of the EM Network's purpose and struc-ture. 2. Lack of engagement regarding EM Network activities. 3. Little to no change perceived in collaborative behavior due to the EM Network. 4. Limited improvement perceived in job satisfaction due to the EM Net-work. 5. Lack of knowledge of EM Net-work offerings. Despite these findings, many in- terview subjects said the EM Network is a credible and respected source and felt collaboration would likely im-prove over time as awareness and momentum builds. conclusions After the first year of operation, the EM Network reviewed its member - ship and online engagement data and collected member feedback. The purpose was to document early suc-cesses and obtain baseline data to guide EM Network development and to use in future evaluations. We found almost three-quarters of EDs and diagnostic and treatment centres in BC had at least one registered EM Network member. However, despite the wide reach of membership, our results suggest that the EM Network needs to increase its efforts to create the awareness, trust, and collabora-tion required for a high-functioning, effective network. Further evaluation Figure 3. Diagram of BC Emergency Medicine Network as perceived by survey respondents, with larger nodes indicating more value. *Includes organizations such as BC Ambulance Service, BC Patient Transfer Network, and Emergency Physician Online SupportThe BC Emergency Medicine Network: Evaluation approach and early findings External organizations* Urban sites Rural sitesGroups169 bc medical journal vol. 61 no. 4, may 2019 bcmj.orgwill help us understand the gaps that members judge to be most important. We found it encouraging that many respondents indicated they al-ready view the EM Network as cred-ible and respected. Possible reasons for this include but are not limited to: The Network's affliliation with the UBC Department of Emergency Medicine. Reputable EM Network members with name recognition. Resonance with the EM Network vision. Clinically relevant website content. Plans to implement real-time support. Our EM Network membership findings indicate that urban members are overrepresented at 54%, based on previous research showing that ur - ban practitioners represent only 45% of all emergency practitioners in BC (unpublished data from 2016 UBC Department of Emergency Medicine survey by Marsden, Archibald, and Christenson), underscoring the need to reach more rural practitioners. Our membership findings also indicate we need to enhance current engage-ment strategies and consult with our partners about ways to encourage more rural practitioner involvement. Patient partners who are also active contributors to EM Network develop-ment may play a pivotal role in advo-cacy and community awareness. With regard to online engage- ment, we found high website us-age rates across BC. Over half of survey respondents indicated they were \"usually\" or \"always\" able to find what they were searching for. We were encouraged by these re-sults though substantial effort is still needed to expand web content. The \"not applicable\" responses to survey questions are difficult to interpret as they could indicate that respondents did not have enough experience with the website to answer the question, or that they had not used the website to look for information. Although the re-ply rate is high for the members-only discussion forum, a small percentage of active users were identified and the EM Network Management Team members have played a significant role in initiating discussions. The use of online discussion forums is low in emergency medicine in general, and it will likely take time to change cur - rent culture and foster more member-driven discussion of issues. Results obtained during the EM Network de-velopment phase show that relatively few BC emergency practitioners use social media, which suggests that a behavioral shift will need to occur for the EM Network to support a larger number of important and interactive online discussions. We will continue to explore strategies to accelerate physician-to-physician interaction through the website. Figure 5.

Instead, most followers are partners and health or - ganizations, health care workers, re-searchers, students, and members of the general public. It can be argued that having a strong following from nonmembers legitimizes the EM Net-work and demonstrates its signficance to society. Furthermore, Twitter activ-ity shows that online discussion fo-rum participation is not the only form of engagement, and other forms need to be considered. Twitter activity also indicates that different individuals prefer other (and potentially multiple) ways to interact with the EM Network. Network success has been de- scribed as occurring when \"members perceive it to be achieved.\" 5 One of the main objectives of the evalua-tion was to learn whether members believe the EM Network is fulfilling its vision and mission, whether goals for the four programs are being met, and whether members are feeling more supported in their work with the EM Network in place. Results from the qualitative interviews show that members believe that there has been noticeable progress regarding: Fulfilling the vision and mission of the EM Network. Establishing a clinical resources structure and repository. Facilitating continuing professional development. Supporting research and innovation. It was not surprising that no prog- ress was seen in implementing the real-time support program since only a pilot in one location has occurred so far. It was also not surprising to find that external organizations were per - ceived as more valuable than individ-ual EDs. Measuring value is important for an effective network to ensure an appreciation of all members within the network. It will be informative to see how the perceptions of members change as the EM Network matures, and how this is reflected in the number of connections between sites and the rating of their relative value. Overall, it is noteworthy that all but one survey respondent felt more supported or somewhat more support-ed with the EM Network in place. As the purpose of the EM Network is to support emergency practitioners, we see this as an indicator of success. Risks of early evaluation While early evaluation provides mul-tiple benefits, there are also known risks. Most notably, studies have shown that the effectiveness of a net-work \"is not likely to be demonstrated in the early years . . . for networks, the added time needed to establish trusting relationships and meaning-ful activity is a factor that must not be underestimated.\" 3 Consequently, members may be less likely to respond to evaluation surveys (as illustrated by our study), which further reinforces the perception that members are not engaged. Exposing missteps through an evaluation can also inhibit mem - bership growth and engagement and diminish enthusiasm in those charged with building the network or provid-ing sponsorship. This may explain why little information on develop-ming networks currently exists. We planned this early evaluation with the belief that these risks were worth tak-ing since such preliminary findings might show where and how we could increase our success. Thus, given the early stage of EM Network develop-ment, we expected to find a general lack of awareness and engagement and were not surprised that the scores for the value of individual organiza-tions in the EM Network were rela-tively low. We were gratified to find the overall structure and approach to support was not challenged, that the website itself is viewed positively, and that authorship and leadership are trusted. Finally, our findings sug-gest practitioners already feel more supported, despite our early stage of network growth, and have provided valuable and specific recommenda-tions for improvement: Increasing face-to-face visits of tar - geted communities. Maintaining or accelerating com-munication strategies to increase engagement. Providing new techniques that en-courage member contributions and comments in order to grow and im-prove content. Study limitations The chief limitation of this study is the low survey response rate. One reason for this may be the email ad-dress used for the survey request, which came from PARTNER and would have been unfamiliar to most recipients. Another reason for the low response rate may be poor mem-ber understanding and awareness of the EM Network, an initiative many knew too little about to provide feed-back on, a notion supported by the responses of interview subjects who stated they were unable to comment on the relatively young network. As a result of the low response rate, the PARTNER analysis consid - ered a limited number of sites and re-lationships, and consequently found a relatively low perception of value for the EM Network. In addition, the PARTNER software was able to han-dle comments from only one member per emergency medicine site. Thus, despite repeating the survey twice and merging the data (something nev-er done before), the resulting sample size of 134 was still modest relative to total EM Network membership. The BC Emergency Medicine Network: Evaluation approach and early findings171 bc medical journal vol. 61 no. 4, may 2019 bcmj.orgSummary This evaluation, undertaken in the first year of EM Network operation, highlights initial successes and iden-tifies areas where further efforts are needed. A low level of awareness of the EM Network and engagement of the emergency medicine commun-ity still exists, and little to no per - ceived changes were reported to date in clinical behavior or job satisfac-tion. Analytics show there is frequent use of the website and membership is growing steadily. While member - ship stood at 44% of all EM practi-tioners in BC at the end of the study period in 2018, membership reached 737 (53%) as of 24 March 2019. We believe our findings are encouraging and appropriate for this early stage of network development, and that they provide valuable insights and strat-egies for others interested in creating and improving clinical networks. The BC Emergency Medicine Network will continue to gather data, evaluate, and make adjustments as necessary. By doing this we can expand network functions, document what success looks like for clinical networks, and fulfill the EM Network's mission of sharing, supporting, and innovating to improve patient care in BC .

The BC Emergency Medicine Network: Evaluation approach and early findings172 bc medical journal vol. 61 no. 4, may 2019 bcmj.orgABSTRACT Mr Ronnie Grigg has been a long-time harm reduction worker in the Vancouver Downtown Eastside and is currently general manager of the Vancouver Overdose Prevention So-ciety. Located at 58 East Hastings St. in Vancouver, British Columbia. The Vancouver Overdose Prevention So-ciety is a not-for-profit organization that oversees hundreds of consump-tions daily. The society began as a tent designated for safe consump-tion and overdose prevention, and was one of the initial community-led responses to the opioid crisis in British Columbia. In 2017, its peer workers\u2014all individuals from the Downtown Eastside community\u2014oversaw more than 100 000 visits to the site, responded to 417 overdos-es, and recorded zero deaths. In mid-September 2018, I interviewed Mr Grigg about his experiences in harm reduction and innovations such as the society that arose in response to the opioid crisis. In this interview Mr Grigg describes his experiences as a front-line harm reduction worker during the crisis, his perspectives on the role of overdose prevention sites as an integral component of the health care system, and the need for increased support of the peer work-ers who staff these sites. special feature JS: Could you please state who you are and your current position?RG: My name is Ronnie Grigg, my title is general manager of the Van-couver Overdose Prevention Soci-ety (OPS), and I've been a long-time front-line worker in the Downtown Eastside. I previously had a leader - ship position at Insite, which was a pioneering safe consumption site in Canada, for many years. With the recent proliferation of overdose pre - vention sites, I've come in to manage OPS, which is also a pioneering site in harm reduction. How would you describe what you do? My role, and the role I share with our management team, is very broad. I'm still a front-line worker attending to overdoses, and I manage the staff at OPS. OPS is a fledgling not-for-profit, so I also handle decision making and funding. We've garnered some world-wide attention, so engaging the media and sharing the collective wisdom is also a significant part of my job now. What has it been like to be a front-line harm reduction worker throughout the opioid crisis?It was autumn 2014 when powdered fentanyl hit. When fentanyl arrived, Insite, which averaged 10 overdoses Mr Stubbs is a PhD student in the Experi- mental Medicine Program (Psychiatry) at the University of British Columbia. His work focuses on characterizing the scope and impact of traumatic brain injury in the homeless and marginally housed. This article has been peer reviewed. Mr Grigg's responses have been lightly edited for clarity and brevity.Harm reduction throughout the opioid crisis: A community responds A conversation with Mr Ronnie Grigg, manager of the vancouver Overdose Prevention Society. Jacob L. Stubbs, BKin per week, went up to 10 per day, overnight. Insite stayed in this 8 to 10 overdoses per day range for 2 years, with spikes during which it got worse. And in the past 2 years it's just con-tinued to worsen. From my perspective, I've seen that the front-line harm reduction worker has been a neglected part of the narrative. We've often been referred to as the first-first-responders\u2014that is, those who attend an overdose be-fore the first responders arrive. What separates us from first responders like fire and ambulance is that more often than not we know the people's names, we've cared for them day in and day out, we've cared for their loved ones. So there's a different relationship and response from harm reduction work-ers in the community. At the height of the crisis there were many nights when you would hear of multiple deaths. One night 173 bc medical journal vol. 61 no. 4, may 2019 bcmj.org Ronnie Grigg outside Vancouver's Overdose Prevention Society. Photo: Colin Askey there were four in my shift alone. So we were attending to overdoses, hear - ing news of someone we cared about dying, processing that grief in the mo-ment, but then also caring for others in their grief. That aspect of trauma for harm reduction workers hasn't re-ally been acknowledged. I don't want to diminish the experience of first responders\u2014they have been deeply affected by this crisis\u2014but for harm reduction workers it's not just the im-pact of responding to an overdose, it's the grief of a community. What does harm reduction and low-barrier care mean to you?An easy way to look at harm reduction is as meeting people where they're at. For the person with sleep deprivation after days of stimulant and opioid use, simply hydrating them is an as-pect of harm reduction. Low-barrier care is about the caregiver modifying themselves to provide care for some-one who has difficulty accessing care. For example, emergency rooms have barriers for some individuals. Many people in this neighborhood cannot go through the triage process in an ER for whatever reason, whether it be stigma from staff, things escalating quickly, or some other factor. What gave rise to the Vancouver Overdose Prevention Society?It was a crisis response. Sarah Blyth\u2014a colleague, friend, and founder of OPS\u2014noticed that the incidences of overdoses were increasing, which began to dominate her days as man - ager of the Downtown Eastside mar - ket. She dedicated a portion of the market to a supervised consumption area under a tent. It was also a bit of an act of community civil disobedience. There were no permissions or exemp-tions given. This was a crisis and this was the response. No one could come in and say, \"take that down,\" because no one else had a solution. It was in-itially funded through a GoFundMe campaign, then the provincial health minister at the time recognized the benefit of these sites and called for funding. Three more sites started within 2 weeks\u2014all peer run with-out embedded clinical support. It was a true community response. Now we have a provincial exemption that ac-knowledges the crisis-response as-pect that allows us to function under the federal exemption standards. What makes OPS different from government-funded safe injection sites such as Insite?It's the low-barrier aspect. Our en-trance is a gate in an alleyway, so our separation from life in that alley is not much. When I worked at Insite we had limitations to what we could help with. In Health Canada's language, as-sisted injection is having a health care provider actually pushing the plunger, and we weren't allowed to formally assist injecting people. What needs to special feature Continued on page 174174 bc medical journal vol. 61 no. 4, may 2019 bcmj.orgbe acknowledged is that this semantic definition is a barrier for some people. For example, a lot of young females depend on someone else to inject them. At places like Insite, these individuals aren't allowed to have someone else inject them. That's not an issue at OPS; your partner can inject you, you can find someone in the room, etc. At OPS we don't require staff to do any of those things, but we let people ask others if anyone can help. Then some-one else on site can help with that injection. If there is a dependency sur - rounding having someone inject, OPS can accommodate that. Insite was al-ways the hallmark of low-barrier care, but it is interesting with the develop-ment of OPS [to realize] how barrier - ed Insite really can be. OPS can also accommodate a wide variety of forms of drugs. We're the only site in Vancouver that can ac-commodate inhalation. And there is also an anonymity that people benefit from at OPS, which combined with the low-barrier aspect provides per - sonal agency. How is the Overdose Prevention Society staffed?OPS uses the peer model, which is based on persons with lived experi-ence [of addiction and life in the Downtown Eastside], and their role historically has been to bridge be-tween the professional and the one who needs care. Before the opioid crisis teams might have a single peer worker attached to a care model. At OPS the ratio has been upended; we've created teams of peers that are supported by a few nonpeers. Dur - ing this crisis it's no longer about that peer group supporting professionals, it's about a community taking charge of their own. These peer community members have such a complex story. There has been something amazing about the community response and about the opportunity for a marginalized group to attend to the needs of their own community. The impact of meaning-ful work, especially for individuals who struggle to get meaningful work, is massive. But how do we leave the heavy lifting of such a massive crisis to such a marginalized and unsupport-ed population? What are we doing for the trauma and the grief of the peer worker? It's a really complex and nu-anced situation. Are there health care providers or first responders at OPS?No, but we can further define that. Everyone at OPS has naloxone train-ing and overdose management train - ing and experience. But as far as any licensed or professional body, we don't have that. Is that a funding restraint? Yes, essentially. I would say it largely boils down to funding. Although there are other constraints, such as Work-SafeBC language with the nurses' unions for example. If someone says, \"f***,\" in my direction, that can be interpreted as verbal abuse. Nurses experience an inordinate amount of abuse in their work environment, but when you put those standards in a front-line environment, WorkSafeBC doesn't have the language to support front-line care. This is a new spectrum of workplace, so workplace language should be informed by us. What role do you believe OPS is fill- ing that the health care system is not?Honestly, those in decision-making positions struggled with a response to this question. Perhaps because they are removed from the front-line ex-perience they have difficulty grasp-ing the immensity of the crisis. I was there, boots on the ground, face first, working nights. I was making my re-quests in the manner that I could, and advocating and supporting the best I could. What I wanted was to increase the number of front-line harm reduc-tion workers\u2014double us up, give us more equipment, just do something. That's what I was advocating for. There was only so much we could do, and it took a long time for our mes-sage to be heard. OPS is a community response providing the lowest-barrier harm reduction services for this com-munity, which is invariably saving lives. Is there more that you think the government or health care profes-sionals can do to support the opioid crisis response or OPS? Yeah, there's tons they could do. The support of harm reduction workers, specifically, is a huge issue. How does a marginalized person who is making $50 a day working at an overdose prevention site get a day off? How do they get mental health support? The complexity around mental health, this work, and its impact demands an immense requirement from us and others. I also recently came across a sys- tematic review paper looking at the efficacy of these sites, but they threw out everything besides eight articles. The perspectives of the drug user, the front-line worker, and the peer worker weren't heard. And the hard data isn't everything. What do you think leads to contro- versy around these sites, and should they be The \"enabler\" sort of self- special feature [Vancouver has] informed policy around the globe. I want people to be proud of that. It might be ugly, it might be confusing, and it might seem chaotic, but we can take care of people in profound ways.Continued from page 173175 bc medical journal vol. 61 no. 4, may 2019 bcmj.orgrighteous posturing behind the idea that everyone should be a contribut-ing member of society, have a job, pay their rent or mortgage. This fails to recognize the limits of our cultural or - ganization. There are people here who will never fit into that mold because of mental illness, mental capacity, or trauma. We need to acknowledge that harm reduction is an important care model, and we need to protect it. I've been living and working in this neighborhood for a long time. So, in some ways, I don't have an effec - tive barometer for controversy. On the other hand, I have a really effective barometer for suffering and needless tragedy. We can respond to this, but the primary barrier is drug policy and access to a clean and safe supply. Let's say that the decriminalization model is trustworthy: instead of a lethal drug supply, one can access a managed, pre-scribed supply. Let's say that access to care increases, and the associated stigma, violence, and crime decreases. special feature Then maybe it's not that bad to have in my neighborhood, right? Vancouver has been a global lead - er in the response to the HIV/AIDS crisis and the experience of HIV/AIDS, and harm reduction. Those are two deeply compassionate experienc - es, and we've informed policy around the globe. I want people to be proud of that. It might be ugly, it might be confusing, and it might seem chaotic, but we can take care of people in pro-found ways. I think that's a flag we should wave. What do you find most encouraging or inspiring about your work?The response to this crisis has emerged from grassroots efforts. In their words, a bunch of junkies just organ-ized. That reality\u2014people advocating for themselves, people changing the face of health care\u2014that's why all of this exists. It was people experiencing the situation and saying, this change needs to happen.

Doctors Helping Doctorscontinue to be innovative and pion- eering, and if you lead with compas-sion, change happens. When we have staff meetings with all the peer staff we start with two acknowledgments\u2014an acknowl-edgment of the land and an acknowl-edgment that we did something significant here. We are the site that innovated this care model. We inform drug policy and care, and now people come to seek out our wisdom. That's inspiring to me. I exhaust my mind, body, and soul caring for people who are suffering unimaginably with grief and trauma. I have two daughters and they are proud of me. That's good, and that's inspiring. And finally, we're beginning to change the language around prohibi-tion. Arresting our way out of this is not working. This is not moral devi-ance; it is people who are hurt, trau-matized, in pain, whatever. This is a medical crisis, not a moral crisis, and we need things to change. 176 bc medical journal vol. 61 no. 4, may 2019 bcmj.orgBritish Columbia continues to have record numbers of illicit drug overdose deaths. Current- ly, ongoing and multisectorial efforts are contributing to a better understand-ing of the factors characterizing or contributing to the overdose epidemic. Recent BC Coroners data 1 indicate there were 1489 suspected illicit drug overdose deaths in 2018 (approxi-mately four deaths per day), similar to the previous year. The data also indi-cate that illicit fentanyl was detected in more than 80% of those deaths, more than 70% of those who died were aged 30 to 59, and more than 80% were males. 1 An earlier descriptive analysis of overdose deaths in BC in 2016-17 indicates that 44% of those who died were employed at the time of death. 2,3 The National Institute for Occu - pational Safety and Health (NIOSH) recently launched a framework ad - dressing workplace factors in the opioid epidemic. Elements of the framework emphasize the need for improved understanding of risk fac-tors associated with the workplace, such as history of workplace injuries and prescription opioids. An improved understanding and determination of occupations and workers at risk for opioid overdose can also help inform the response to the opioid epidemic. 4 Opioid pain medication is asso- ciated with risks including overdose and opioid use disorder. WorkSafeBC has been developing best practices and alternatives in managing long-term chronic noncancer pain through a multifaceted Opioids Harm Reduc-tion Program. The program includes ongoing education on topics such as WorkSafeBC's multimodal approach to chronic noncancer pain management: New hotline for physicians This article is the opinion of WorkSafeBC and has not been peer reviewed by the BCMJ Editorial Board.worksafebc appropriate opioid prescriptions, opi- ate agonist treatment, evidence-based treatment of chronic pain. WorkSafeBC's practical experi- ence provides clear evidence that long-term use of opioids typically yields few long-term improvements in pain and function. 5 Recognizing the lack of benefits and the risk of harms from prolonged opioid use in managing chronic noncancer pain, WorkSafeBC issued practice direc-tive #C10-1, \"Claims with opioids, sedative/hypnotics or other prescribed potentially addictive drugs,\" which is available on www.worksafebc.com. The practice directive provides pre-scription timelines, recommended dosages, and a schedule of opioid follow-up reviews. During the past 2 years Work- SafeBC content experts have been delivering an outreach program to health care providers. The sessions, \"Not just a prescription pad: A mul - timodal approach to chronic pain management,\" are free for attendees, fully accredited, and aligned with the College of Physicians and Sur - geons of BC's practice standards for the safe prescribing of opioids. The workshops address best practices in safe prescribing of opioids; taper - ing, substitution, and exit strategies; various pharmacological and non-pharmacological strategies for the treatment of chronic noncancer pain; and community resources, includ-ing WorkSafeBC programs available to injured workers with an accepted WorkSafeBC claim (list of rehabilita - tion programs and services is avail-able on www.worksafebc.com). The intent is to bring together community health care providers such as physi-cians, nurse practitioners, pharma-cists, and physiotherapists to help develop collaboration and capacity at the local level. In 2018, WorkSafeBC hosted 11 sessions in communities across the province reaching 230 at - tendees, of whom 73% were family physicians or residents and 11% were nurse practitioners.

Her blood cul-ture tested positive for Brucella ca-nis. She helped transport rescue dogs from Mexico and the US to British Columbia, including a pregnant dog from Mexico that spontaneously aborted two stillborn puppies during transport. The dog tested positive for B. canis by immunofluorescent anti-body test. This was the first recorded human B. canis infection in BC. B. canis is rarely transmitted to humans; chil-dren and immunosuppressed indi - viduals may be at higher risk. Four canine cases were documented in BC in 2017-18, all in imported dogs. The incidence is likely underestimated. Zero to two cases of human brucel-losis are reported annually. Most are caused by B. melitensis acquired via contact with ruminants or consump - tion of unpasteurised milk in endemic countries. Dogs are imported into Canada for personal, commercial, or compas-sionate reasons. In 2013-14, 197 Ca-nadian rescue organizations imported 6189 dogs, 1 with actual numbers like - ly significantly higher. Some dogs carry diseases that are rare in Cana-da and may pose a risk to the public ( Table ). Canine rabies is endemic in many countries. Dogs over 3 months old must have a certificate of rabies vac-cination prior to entry into Canada. 2 There is a small risk of introduction of rabies with imported dogs as some are too young to be vaccinated and certificates are not routinely verified. bc centre for disease control Brucellosis and other diseases imported with dogs If a dog bites a person in BC and has been in an endemic country in the past 6 months, consult the local public health department to assess and man-age rabies risk. 3 Echinococcus multilocularis is a canine tapeworm that can cause alveo-lar echinococcosis in humans through inadvertent ingestion of eggs shed by infected dogs. The disease is very rare in southern Canada, though recently there have been reports of locally ac-quired E. multilocularis infection in dogs in BC, Alberta, and Ontario. 4 The emergence has been attributed to range expansion of infected imported dogs. Deworming in the country of or - igin or upon arrival decreases the risk. Although severe, all these infec- tions are preventable. Counsel pa - tients to have imported dogs assessed by a veterinarian to ensure they are free of disease and adequately im - munized. If a patient presents with compatible symptoms, consult an in-fectious diseases specialist or medical microbiologist to determine the diag-nostic workup. When completing a requisition, it is important to indicate \"exposure to rescue dog\" on the form because special laboratory safety pre-cautions are necessary to prevent lab-oratory staff from acquiring B. canis. Ask the patient about animal expo-sure and its origin and report unusual diseases and zoonotic exposures to the local medical health officer. \u2014Eleni Galanis, MD Physician Epidemiologist, Communicable Diseases and Immunization Service, BCCDC \u2014Steven Trerise, CPHI(C) Environmental Health Officer, Communicable Disease, Fraser Health Authority \u2014Jasmine Ahmed-Bentley, MD Medical Microbiologist, Fraser Health Authority \u2014Gregory D.

Certain medical conditions, such as migraines with auras, prevent adolescents from being able to use combined oral contraception because of their increased risk of blood clots. Among these adolescents, both hor - monal and nonhormonal IUDs can be safely used. 1,7 Cost is a significant barrier to ac- cessing contraception. A recent Amer - ican study assessed pregnancy and abortion rates among teens who were provided free contraception, includ-ing LARC, and compared them to the American national average. Authors found that birth, abortion, and preg - nancy rates were significantly lower among teens who were provided free contraception compared to all other teens. 8 In BC in 2015, 828 babies were born to mothers under age 20.9 There are social, educational, and physical risks associated with unintended preg-nancy in adolescence. 10 Unintended teen pregnancies are associated with poorer educational achievement and lower income for the mother. Babies born to teen mothers are more likely to be born preterm and small for ges-tational age, which increases the risk for a stay in a neonatal intensive care unit. 11 At sexual health clinics across the province, oral contraceptives are often the only contraception choice available for free, despite evidence that LARC is more effective and cost-efficient. 12 While it is laudable It is time to improve access to first-line contraception for BC's youth Authors call on the government of British Columbia to cover the cost of long-acting reversible contraception for youth in this province so they can access first-line contraception without barriers.

For teens from families who do not qual-ify for Fair Pharmacare, the burden is on the teen to either buy the IUD or ask for financial assistance from their family. Because confidential-ity is a foundational aspect of ado-lescent care, 13 and sexual health care in particular, it is problematic to rely on adolescents to communicate with their parents about covering the cost of an IUD in order to receive the protection. LARC is now the first-line rec- ommended option for contraception among teens. It is time for the prov-ince to follow evidence-based prac-tice by removing barriers to LARC and funding it for youth under age 25 across the province. Competing interests None declared.

Studies of similar ex-periences in Fort McMurray, Alberta, after wildfires forced total evacuation in 2016, suggest that psychosocial impacts from the fires were wide-spread and likely to persist following evacuation. 5 In the context of disas- ters, health care providers and first responders are often among those af-fected. Despite growing appreciation of the mental health effects associated with climate change, measuring these effects has proven to be particularly challenging due to the problems of causation and attribution. 3 For physicians and other health care providers, the mental health ef-fects of climate change will undoubt-edly continue to affect our patients, our practices, and our communities for years to come. In this context, support for mitigation and adaptation strategies by clinicians is essential. 6 Adaptation strategies focus on sys-temic modifications to reduce the risk of and cope with the negative effects of climate change. The 2018 Lancet Countdown Briefing for Canadian Policymakers recommended invest-ing in research on the mental health effects of climate change and psycho-social adaptation. 7 Building a robust evidence base to inform adaptation measures to protect and promote mental health is a critical first step. Possible adaptation measures target - ing mental health may include: Expanding access to mental health services, including cognitive be-havioral therapy, crisis counseling, and individual/group therapy. Increasing primary care interven-tions to improve mental health and promote resilience.

According to a 2016 report from the Canadian Chronic Disease Surveillance System, about three-quarters of Canadians who used health services for a mental illness an-nually consulted for mood and anxi-ety disorders. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is often recommended as ther - apy for mild to moderate anxiety and depression, and has proven to be as effective as antidepressants in treat-ing depression 2 and most anxiety dis- orders.3 CBT therapy is covered by MSP, but waits for psychiatric support are long, meaning patients often look to their GP for care. In fact, 80% of people with mental health issues re-ceive care in the primary care setting. 4 A grassroots solution in Victoria and the South Island Surveys show that 24.3% of Vancou- ver Island residents report suffering from anxiety and depression. 5 Rec- ognizing that GPs on South Vancou-ver Island needed more support to care for these patients, the Victoria Division of Family Practice and the Shared Care Committee funded the development of CBT Skills Groups, with Shared Care and the South Island Division of Family Practice also sup-porting the project as a mental health initiative for South Vancouver Island. Group CBT appointments: Enabling GPs to support patients with mild to moderate mental health issues This article is the opinion of the GPSC and has not been peer reviewed by the BCMJ Editorial Board.The skills groups are based on CBT principles and practices. Ses- sions focus on self-management, pro-viding participants with a variety of coping tools so they can decide what works best for them. The CBT Skills Group program, which is designed to be delivered within primary care, was co-developed by psychiatrists and family physicians. The groups are funded by MSP billing, meaning the only cost to participants is a $35 fee to pay for the program workbook (and this fee can be waived in cases of financial hardship). Each cohort accepts up to 15 people, and sessions run between 90 and 120 minutes. The program supports GPs to do training and develop CBT skills, increasing their confidence in caring for patients with mild to moderate mental health conditions, and enabling them to di-versify their practice and care for pa-tients in their own clinics. Participant feedback has been positive, highlight-ing the quality of the facilitators, af - fordability and accessibility of the program, and the fact that the group format allows for peer support and re-inforcement that participants are not alone. A sharable model of care Once physicians were trained and the program was established in Vic - toria, psychiatrists on the project team trained a group of South Island Div-ision physicians to expand the service to the Western Communities and the Saanich Peninsula. Currently, both the South Island Division and Victoria Division-trained facilitators work together to service the South Vancou-ver Island region. The program and its referrals are administered by the CBT Skills Groups Society of Victoria. With support from the Shared Care Committee, the Victoria program has spread to a number of communities across BC, including Vancouver. The Vancouver Division of Family Prac-tice funded the development of the program in its own community, which now runs with seven locally trained physician facilitators and its own dedicated referral centre. The Victo-ria Division shared all of its materials (workbook, referral form, and pro-cesses) and provided ongoing advice to initiate the program in Vancouver. Divisions and physicians who would like to learn more about CBT Skills Groups, or who are considering adopting the model, can visit the Vic-toria Division website 6 or the Shared Care Learning Centre website.7 The Shared Care Learning Centre features a profile for CBT Skills Groups, in-cluding a readiness assessment and details for how divisions can get start-ed in implementing the program. \u2014Afsaneh Moradi Director, Community Partnership and Integration References 1.

Dr Winston was already provid- ing a complex peripheral nerve clin-ic with plastics and hand surgeon Dr Emily Krauss, who specializes in nerve transfers for people with spinal cord injury. He approached Dr Daniel Vincent, interventional anesthesiolo-gist, on how they could best repro-duce an individual lidocaine selective nerve motor block to spastic muscles to choose the most responsible mus-cle causing spastic deformity and de-termine if the patient had underlying contracture. From a 1-day session with phys- iatrists from Victoria, Vancouver, and Nanaimo, they learned the technique by adding ultrasound guidance to what was previously an EMG guided technique. The change in range of motion in the spastic limbs was suffi-ciently profound that Dr Vincent, who had decades of experience using cryo-neurotomy for sensory nerve pain re-lief, suggested adapting the protocol to motor nerves. This decades-old technique of freezing nerves involves a percutaneous ice ball at -60 \u00b0C. Af-ter 6 months of researching the tech - nique, and finding only one published case of motor cryoneurotomies, the team began to offer cryoneurotomy, resulting in impressive change in function. At the same time, Dr Krauss began to offer selective microsfas - cicular neurotomies by stimulating the tiny nerve branches of selective nerves and cutting the branches to the most spastic muscle group found after the ultrasound-guided nerve blocks. By cutting nerves, she has been restoring active hand opening to patients with no hand function, or opening nonfunctional clenched fists with skin breakdown. Dr Krauss spe-cialized in this microfascicular ar - rangement of nerves in her fellowship in St. Louis. The Victoria physicians have part-nered with Vancouver-based physiat-rists, led by Dr Rajiv Reebye, along with Dr Patricia Mills and Dr Heather Finlayson and orthopaedic surgeons Drs Kishore Mulpuri, Lise Leveille, Tom Goetz to create a new or - ganization, the Canadian Advances in Neuro-Orthopedics for Spastic - ity Congress. An inaugural congress in April (www.canosc.com) brought international experts together in Van-couver. Together they plan to ad-vocate for collaborative care with physical therapies, botulinum toxin, and bracing. The project was supported by a grant from the Specialist Servic-es Committee, a joint collaborative committee of Doctors of BC and the Ministry of Health.

Vancouver CBT Skills Group Program increases capacity for referrals The Vancouver Division of Family Practice is offering an 8-week Cog-nitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) Skills Group for young adult and adult patients (18 and older) who are suffering low to moderate anxiety, depression, and other lower-acuity mental health diagnoses. CBT is an evidence-based treatment for anxiety or depression. The program is psycho- educational and skills focused, with New medical retina referral clinic at St. Paul's Hospital Providence Health Care in conjunc tion with Drs Bill Ross, David Albiani, Andrew Merkur, Andrew Kirker, and Kaivon Pakzad Vaezi are pleased to announce the establishment of a medical retina consultation service in the Eye Clinic at St. Paul's Hospital starting 8 May 2019. The consultation service will focus on the diagnosis and treatment of diabetic eye disease, macular degeneration, branch and central vein occlusions, inflammatory eye conditions, and inherited macular dystrophies and disorders. Diabetic retinopathy remains the leading cause of visual disability in Canadians of working age between 20 and 65. Macular degeneration is the main cause of blindness in Canadians over 65. The St. Paul's Hospital Eye Clinic has recently obtained a state-of-the- art Optos wide-field fundus camera, which will be able to detect the earliest manifestations of diabetic retinopathy and macular degeneration. Patients who are diagnosed with macular pathology will be able to receive laser pho-tocoagulation treatment or intravitreal anti-VEGF injections at the clinic. Referred patients will be evaluated by the medical retina fellow along with the retina staff. A full consultation report including the appropriate diagnostic testing will be sent to the referring doctor. Appointments for this new service can be made by phone: 604 874-0404, or fax: 604 874-0099.

New HIV screening opportunities A study from the BC Centre for Excel- lence in HIV/AIDS (BC-CfE) uncov-ered new opportunities to diagnose individuals living with HIV in the health care system. In 2017, nearly a quarter of those diagnosed with HIV in BC had a CD4 count that was low, a major indicator of a weakened im-mune system and advanced HIV dis-ease. HIV testing rates have steadily increased in the province since 2014, with more than 87 900 British Col- umbians accessing an HIV test in the last quarter of 2018. However, data analyzed by the BC-CfE showed 1 in 7 individuals living with HIV in BC could have been diagnosed earlier\u2014if health care providers had recognized certain key clinical conditions as trig-gers for HIV screening. According to the BC-CfE study, published in PLOS-One, individuals aged 40 years or older, heterosexu-als, people living in remote areas, and people who had ever injected drugs were more likely to have had a missed opportunity for an earlier HIV diagnosis. Researchers defined a missed HIV testing opportunity as an encounter with a health care provider due to a condition or clinical symp-toms possibly associated with HIV . This included recurrent pneumonia, shingles among individuals younger than 50 years old, and anemia. A late diagnosis of HIV can affect individu-als by increasing their risk of hospi-talization, progression to AIDS, and premature mortality. Missed oppor - tunities for earlier HIV diagnoses can also increase the risk of transmission of the virus to others and can put in-creased demand on the health care system. BC HIV testing guidelines, avail - able since 2014, recommend health care providers offer individuals an HIV test every 5 years. Individuals considered at high-risk of HIV are recommended to have an HIV test at least once per year. The study, \"Missed opportuni- ties for earlier diagnosis of HIV in British Columbia, Canada: A ret - rospective cohort study, is avail-able at https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal .pone.0214012. UBC researchers develop heart valve aimed at high-risk patients Researchers at UBC Okanagan have created the first-ever nanocomposite biomaterial heart valve developed to reduce or eliminate complications re-lated to heart transplants. By using a newly developed technique, the re-searchers were able to build a more durable valve that enables the heart to adapt faster and more seamlessly. Assistant Professor Hadi Mohamma-di runs the Heart Valve Performance Laboratory (HVPL) through UBC Okanagan's School of Engineering. Lead author on the study, he says the newly developed valve is an example of a transcatheter heart valve, a prom-ising new branch of cardiology. These valves can be inserted into a patient through small incisions rather than opening a patient's chest. Existing transcatheter heart valves are made of animal tissues, most often the pericar - dium membrane from a cow's heart.

BC Dental Association resources for physicians Oral care manual for cancer patients BC Cancer has developed a manual to provide user-friendly, evidence-based guidelines for the management of oral side effects of cancer therapy. This manual will allow community-based practitioners to more effectively man-age patients in their practices. The in-formation contained in this manual has been collected from many resour - ces, most significantly from the work of the Oral Care Section of the Multi - national Association for Supportive Care in Cancer and the International Society of Oral Oncology. It is well known that maintaining good oral health is important in can-cer patients, including patients with hematologic malignancies. Oral pain or infections can cause delays, reduc-tions, or discontinuation of life-sav-ing cancer treatment. Poor oral health can also lead to negative impacts on news a patient's quality of life including psychological distress, social isola-tion, and inadequate nutrition. These guidelines have been developed to achieve better patient outcomes. The manual is available on the BC Dental Association's website: https://bcden tal.org/Dental_Health/Oral_Care _Manual_2018.pdf. Early childhood oral-health resources BC Dental Association also has new resources to educate expectant par - ents, new parents, and caregivers about the importance of early child-hood oral health and the impact of early childhood caries on children's healthy development.
