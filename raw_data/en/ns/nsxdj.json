So as a middle economy nation, the population of India has been unprotected from a range of infectious diseases, lifestyle disbalance, nutritional deficiency and medical problems. The prevalence of diseases, their resulting aftereffects, and their impact on patients and their family members will be significantly reduced if quality-assured health services are available. Moreover, India doesn't fulfil the recommended norms for the number of health care experts per head of population. The National Health Commission has adopted the Ayurveda, Yoga, Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homoeopathy (AYUSH) system of native medicine to counter the challenge of this shortage of healthcare professionals to support the medicinal system of the health care service. AYUSH system: In India, other than allopathic medicine, different forms of scientifically suitable and acceptable indigenous medicine systems, such as the Ayurveda, Unani, Siddha, Homoeopathy, Yoga and Naturopathy (AYUSH) system, are practised in various parts of the nation. Ayurveda: Ayurveda, a natural medicinal system, developed in India more than 3,000 years ago. Ayurveda combines two Sanskrit words, Ayur (life) and Veda (science or knowledge). Ayurveda believes that biological imbalance is the main cause of diseases; Ayurveda encourages certain lifestyles and natural therapies to regain a balance between the body, mind, spirit, and the environment. Ayurveda treatises express three basic doshas, viz. vta, pitta, and Kapha, dividing medicine into eight canonical components to counter the diseases. Yoga: Yoga is a group of physical and mental practices that originated in historic India. It is an art and science of healthy living. Yoga leads to perfect collaborations between mind and body, individual consciousness and universal sensation. Yoga helps build up psycho-physiological health and emotional semblance and reduces daily stress and its consequences. Various yogic practices such as Yoga Asanas, Pranayama, Dhyana, cleansing and relaxation practices, etc., are known for managing non-communicable diseases like hypertension, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), bronchial asthma, diabetes, sleep disorders, etc. Yoga has also been useful in vulnerable populations such as the elderly and children. Naturopathy: The term \"naturopathy\" originates from \"natura\" and \"pathos\" to suggest \"natural healing\". Diagnosis and treatment concern primarily alternative therapies and \"natural\" methods that naturopaths claim to promote the body's natural ability to heal. Naturopathy focuses on a unique approach, avoiding the use of surgery and conventional medicines. In cancelling, naturopaths' evidence-based medicines wish to prevent illness through stress reduction and diet and lifestyle control. Traditional naturopathy deals exclusively with lifestyle changes, not diagnosing or treating disease. Moreover, yoga and naturopathy are preventive methods for our immunity system against diseases. Unani: Unani is a traditional medical system practised in the middle east and south Asian countries. It contains herbs and animal- minerals in origin (Approximately 90% herbal, 4-5% animal and 5-6 % mineral). It is a medical system that deals with the various stages of health and provides preventive, curative and rehabilitative health services. It considers the individual about his environment and the health of the body, mind and soul with nature. The Unani System of Medicine offers treatment of diseases related to all the systems and organs of the human body. The Unani has a highly effective impact on chronic ailments and diseases of the skin, liver, musculoskeletal and reproductive systems, and immunological and lifestyle disorders. It is presently practised in India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Nepal, China, Iran, Iraq, Malaysia, Indonesia etc. The Government of India took this Unani system and integrated it into our health care system through the Ayush project. Sidda: Siddha is one of the most ancient medical systems in India. Siddha is the mother medicine of ancient Tamils/Dravidians of peninsular South India. The word Siddha means established truth. Fundamental Principles of Siddha include theories of Five Elements (Aimpootham) and Three Forces/Faults (Mukkuttram). The Eight Methods of Examination (Avakai Theruvukal) determines the diagnosis, aetiology, and treatment. Siddha has safe herbal mineral treatments for psoriasis, eczema, alopecia, diabetic ulcers, warts, vitiligo, pemphigus, pompholyx, leprosy, etc. many more very common and rare diseases. Homoeopathy: Homoeopathy is a 200-year-old therapeutic method that uses various medicines to promote self-healing and autoregulatory processes. Homoeopathy chooses chemicals by comparing a patient's symptoms to the symptoms that these compounds cause in healthy people. Proponents argue that serial dilution and shaking imprint information into the water, which is how medicines are made. Homoeopathy had a key place in 19th-century health treatment and has recently undergone a worldwide renaissance. Homoeopathy is a controlled trial medicinal system. According to research, homoeopathy appears ineffective for migraines, delayed-onset muscle pain, and influenza prevention. There isn't enough evidence to back up homoeopathy's effectiveness for the most part. At last, it is great that the initiative of the Indian government to combine all types of medicinal systems Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homoeopathy in one system to deliver good health services. Conclusion: Traditional and complementary medicine is gaining recognition worldwide, and certain nations, such as India, have a well-developed traditional medical system. Learning from countries like China and other countries with well-functioning traditional medical systems might help India's Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha, and Homoeopathy systems. The necessity of the system is for a very strong, hopeful approach to extending our medical legacy. Because the efforts are neither wholly insufficient nor sufficient, a sustained effort to revive and disseminate our medical heritage for society's benefit is extremely desirable. "}
