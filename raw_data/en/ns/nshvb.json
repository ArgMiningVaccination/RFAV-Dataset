on vaccine development, and closely monitored and studied developments on emerging vaccine platforms such as messenger RNA (mRNA). We continued to share the latest updates on the development, interim authorisation and safety information of COVID-19 medical devices, medicines and vaccines. Thanks to these partnerships, HSA has kept abreast of the rapidly evolving international situation and contributed to global regulatory efforts to develop and approve high-quality, safe and effective medical devices, medicines and vaccines to address the COVID-19 pandemic. MESSAGE FROM THE CHAIRMAN PROFESSOR SATKUNANANTHAM S/O KANDIAH Chairman10 11 RISING TO THE CHALLENGEANNUAL REPORT 2020/2021HSA BOARD CHAIRMAN'S MESSAGE scientists in the region, we began a study on the use of simulated DNA mixture profiles based on the local Chinese, Malay and Indian populations. Through this study, we now have novel insights about the impact of allele dropout and the differences between intra-ethnic and inter-ethnic DNA mixtures. Together with other government laboratories from Canada, Germany, UK, Australia, USA, Netherlands and Switzerland, HSA is working on an international collaborative study to determine specific cannabinoids (tetrahydrocannabinol, tetrahydrocannabinolic acid, cannabidiol and cannabidiolic acid) in cannabis products. The results will ensure greater alignment of standards across the board. Organisation-wide digitalisation initiatives Digitalisation continued to be a big part of our process improvements. We accelerated the adoption of digital signatures and began working with GovTech to automate and digitalise HSA's internal workflows and processes. Time and manpower savings were also achieved through the implementation of robotic process automation (RPA) to digitalise manual and repetitive tasks. Improving workflow We rolled out a new laboratory information management system for our Applied Sciences Group which incorporates many digitalised workflows that enable data to move seamlessly across different laboratories and instruments. Some of the features include paperless submission/collection process for key stakeholders, dispatch of e-reports, and e-inventory for tracking of chemicals, reagents and drug reference standards. With this system, about 80% of our laboratories' workflows and processes have been digitalised. We have also received positive feedback from users and stakeholders that the system has helped to streamline their operational processes. Improving efficiency The laboratories also utilised RPA to replace some of the tasks which previously required human intervention. Such automation greatly reduces human transcription and interpretation errors. RPA is also used in the blood services labs. Maintaining blood transfusion records used to be a tedious and manual task that took two to three hours a day. With RPA, the task has become much simpler, taking only two to three minutes. Likewise, the manual uploading of blood donation testing reports used to take about eight hours a month, but it now takes only 1.5 hours. Keeping ourselves relevant As part of our digital transformation efforts, we also developed the HSA Digitalisation Training Framework to build knowledge and equip staff with basic and specialised digital skills. A training catalogue comprising a list of courses has been curated to help staff identify suitable digital courses that are relevant for their areas of work. Such courses include data analytics, user experience design and agile project management. Looking ahead We recognise the importance of strengthening HSA's resilience and agility to cope with unexpected situations and challenges. We will continue to equip ourselves with the skills and knowledge necessary to thrive in this new landscape. I am confident that we have what it takes to ride out any storm and come out enriched and stronger.There was no let-up to the intensity of the previous year as the pandemic took on a new dimension. Even with the challenges and surge in workload, we managed to maintain close ties with our partners and counterparts, and pressed on with our transformation journey to streamline our processes and enhance efficiency. Keeping up to date on the global developments regarding COVID-19 medical devices, medicines and vaccines We participated actively in many international scientific discussions on vaccine development, and closely monitored and studied developments on emerging vaccine platforms such as messenger RNA (mRNA). We continued to share the latest updates on the development, interim authorisation and safety information of COVID-19 medical devices, medicines and vaccines. Thanks to these partnerships, HSA has kept abreast of the rapidly evolving international situation and contributed to global regulatory efforts to develop and approve high-quality, safe and effective medical devices, medicines and vaccines to address the COVID-19 pandemic. While vaccinations are being conducted globally, HSA has also been discussing the need for robust post-market pharmacovigilance cooperation and rapid sharing of information about adverse events with our overseas counterparts. Such cooperation will allow regulators to monitor the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines and quickly take the appropriate actions. Maintaining our partnerships As part of the new normal, we kept to virtual meetings to continue our networking with partner agencies and counterparts. We shared best practices with other blood establishments within the Asia Pacific Blood Network (APBN) during the COVID-19 pandemic. This allowed us to keep up to date on developments involving donor eligibility and management, and strategies to secure the national blood supply. We also embarked on a Blood Bank User Research Project with Singapore Polytechnic to develop strategies to improve the blood donation experience for both donors and staff, and strategies to engage and retain donors to become regular donors. Work sharing with our overseas counterparts In the area of health products regulation, our strong ties with our strategic global partners enabled timely exchange of information and work sharing. We have an ongoing collaboration with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Oncology Centre of Excellence to provide a framework for concurrent submission and review of oncology products among international regulatory health authorities. Through this collaboration, we have issued regulatory approvals for five applications. In April 2020, we kicked off our first work-sharing project with Malaysia's National Pharmaceutical Regulatory Agency to evaluate generic medicines. Our progress from parallel review to work-sharing is a significant step towards achieving regulatory efficiency. Building our knowledge Due to a lack of data outside the Caucasian population, estimating the number of persons who contribute to a DNA mixture profile can be challenging. To better assist forensic DNA 12 13 RISING TO THE CHALLENGEANNUAL REPORT 2020/2021HSA BOARD CEO'S MESSAGE I would like to applaud HSAians for their strong sense of service to the nation and passion for excellence. We have demonstrated how we are committed to integrity, professionalism, efficiency and innovativeness in carrying out our work. While the pandemic has put us to the test, I am immensely proud that in this 20th anniversary of HSA's formation, we have demonstrated our resilience, motivation and commitment in contributing to the nation's fight against COVID-19 and our ongoing organisational transformation efforts. MESSAGE FROM THE CEO2021 marks not just the 20th anniversary of HSA since its formation, but also one of our most challenging years. With each development of the COVID-19 pandemic, we found ourselves needing to respond quickly and adapt faster than ever before. Through it all, we managed to remain focused and steadfast in our mission to protect public health and safety. Facilitating speedy access to critical health products Our health products regulatory staff have had to deal with many time-sensitive applications for vaccines, medical devices and medicines critical in supporting the nation's fight against COVID-19. Speed without compromising safety Since the pandemic began, we expedited the approval of many critical medical devices based on a risk- calibrated review process to ensure essential safety, quality and performance requirements were met. We approved over 195* diagnostic test kits, ranging from reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT -PCR) to serology and antigen rapid tests, to confirm COVID-19 infections; and five ventilators for seriously ill patients in ICU. More recently, in May and June 2021, we approved five antigen rapid tests (two of which were first-in-the-world approvals) for self-testing and two breathalysers. The ARTs are widely available at pharmacies and other retail outlets such as supermarkets for members of the public to buy and do the test at their convenience. The two breathalysers, which are first-in-the-world innovations developed by local start-up companies with the support of two local universities, detect COVID-19 infection by analysing breath samples from individuals and report the results in one to two minutes. HSA will continue to closely monitor the clinical performance of these tests to ensure that they continue to be safe and effective in detecting COVID-19 infections. Expedited route for vaccines, medicines and medical devices Recognising the urgent public health need for early access to critical novel vaccines, medicines and medical devices during the pandemic, we developed (in six months) and introduced the Pandemic Special Access Route (PSAR) on 1 December 2020. PSAR enables us to start our evaluation from the early stages of clinical studies, as and when real-time data is submitted by the companies on a \"rolling\" basis, instead of waiting for the full data set to be ready before starting our evaluation. PSAR allows a speedier, yet thorough, review to ensure that these novel health products meet the necessary high quality, safety and efficacy standards. To date, *As of July 2021 DR CHOONG MAY LING, MIMI Chief Executive Officer14 15 RISING TO THE CHALLENGEANNUAL REPORT 2020/2021HSA BOARD CEO'S MESSAGE we have granted the first-in-Asia interim authorisation of Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, in December 2020 and February 2021 respectively. These vaccines have since been used in the national vaccination programme by the Ministry of Health. In June, sotrovimab, a monoclonal antibody, was granted approval, allowing infectious disease specialists to use it for the treatment of mild-to-moderate COVID-19 in patients. HSA continues to actively monitor the safety of the PSAR-authorised COVID-19 vaccines to detect any potential safety concerns so that relevant measures can be taken to ensure the vaccines remain safe for use. We review submitted adverse event reports together with our expert panels to ascertain that the benefits of the vaccines continue to outweigh the risks, and update the public at regular intervals on potential safety signals identified in our assessments. Ensuring a steady blood supply Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, HSA has put in place measures to safeguard the health of our donors and build donor confidence. Blood collection dipped during the initial Circuit Breaker period. Together with our partner, the Singapore Red Cross, we asked blood donors to continue coming forward to help secure the nation's blood supply. I am heartened to share that thanks to the strong support of our blood donors and partners, blood donations continued steadily and we have managed to keep blood stocks healthy throughout the year. Rendering forensic support Our staff from the Forensic Medicine Division (FMD) rose to the challenge, carrying out autopsies on suspected, positive and post-COVID-19 cases. Though little was known about the virus and its risks in the beginning, processes were reviewed every day to ensure that safeguards were adequate to protect our staff and their workplaces. FMD has been steadily refining their biosafety practices, given their experience with the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003, such as putting in place enhanced personal protection measures and more stringent work processes. A dedicated and competently trained forensic team had to work in a special Bio-safety level 4 autopsy suite for positive COVID-19-cases that were still infectious at the time of autopsy. Besides our COVID-19 related work, we achieved several milestones in our health product regulatory, blood services and analytical testing work. Implementation of regulations for cell, tissue and gene therapy products In February 2021, we gazetted subsidiary legislation to effect the implementation of cell, tissue and gene therapy products (CTGTP) regulations. CTGTP is an exciting therapeutic area that is developing rapidly. It is a new class of health products, comprising stem cells, tissues and genetically modified organisms, that can potentially offer cures for chronic and debilitating diseases. The implementation of the regulations was a significant milestone that had been years in the making, from policy conceptualising to public consultation and drafting of the regulations. Enhancing the safety of donated blood HSA has included Hepatitis E (HEV) testing as part of our routine screening protocol as of June 2021, further enhancing the safety of donated blood. HSA identified Hepatitis E (HEV) as a potential transfusion transmissible infection based on worldwide clinical and transfusion data. After conducting local viraemia and seroprevalence studies, we decided to use the molecular method for detecting HEV in donated blood. We continue to assess the risks of emerging and re-emerging transfusion-transmissible infections and evaluate the appropriate risk management strategies in a systematic and comprehensive manner to benefit patients at risk.Maintaining dexterity in our testing and detection methods To combat the issue of hand sanitiser manufacturers using lower-grade ethanol in their products, we came up with an analytical method utilising Gas Chromatography-High Resolution Accurate Mass (GC-HRAM) technology to test for impurities. Subsequently, hand sanitisers that were found to contain a high level of impurities or adulterated with methanol were recalled. When regulatory agencies worldwide learned about the potential contamination of 1-nitroso-4-methylpiperazine (MNP) in rifampicin drug substances, there were no standard tests for such analysis available internationally. Our dedicated team from the Pharmaceutical Laboratory expeditiously developed a Liquid Chromatography Hybrid Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) test to quantitate the presence of MNP in rifampicin products. Our ability to analyse these products enabled us to take the appropriate regulatory actions. Being recognised for our good work HSA won a total of three Public Sector Transformation Awards in 2021. These are awards that recognise public officers and agencies for work and organisational excellence. We won two One Public Service Awards \u2014 one for building capacity and capability for COVID-19 testing, and another for securing access to COVID-19 vaccines. We also won an Agility award, which was awarded to our colleagues from the Health Products Regulation Group for our concerted fight against COVID-19. The Singapore Health Quality Service Awards 2021 accords special honour on healthcare professionals and partners who have stood up and contributed to the nation's fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. The Forensic Medicine Division and the Blood Services Group won the Team Commendation Award, and Dr Paul Chui garnered the SuperHero Award (Clinician - Merit). Supporting our staff The pandemic has radically changed the way we work. We entered a full work from home arrangement for staff who could, and put in place additional safety measures for staff who had to continue to work in the frontline (blood banks) or in the labs or conduct enforcement work. Online meetings with colleagues, stakeholders, partners and overseas counterparts are now the norm instead of face-to-face interactions. This new work arrangement has required us to adapt and adopt a shift in mindset. To better facilitate the remote working arrangement, we equipped meeting rooms in HSA with video conferencing capabilities to enable hybrid-meetings between physical and remote participants, and strengthened IT touchpoints and support, including a tech refresh of laptops. To ease our staff into the new routine of working remotely, we started a series of regular virtual get-together sessions. These Coffee Chat sessions were organised to enable staff to communicate and connect with each other. We invited experts to share on topics such as mindfulness, resilience, stress management and positive psychology. Specially curated self-care tips were also sent via Electronic Direct Mailers (EDMs) to motivate and remind staff to care for themselves and look out for others. A one-stop COVID-19 Employee Support Portal was also launched in December 2020 to enable staff to look for relevant information, such as overseas travel notifications and Quarantine Order (QO)/Stay Home Notice (SHN) reporting. Forging ahead I would like to applaud HSAians for their strong sense of service to the nation and passion for excellence. We have demonstrated how we are committed to integrity, professionalism, efficiency and innovativeness in carrying out our work. While the pandemic has put us to the test, I am immensely proud that in this 20th anniversary of HSA's formation, we have demonstrated our resilience, motivation and commitment in contributing to the nation's fight against COVID-19 and our ongoing organisational transformation efforts. 16 17 RISING TO THE CHALLENGEANNUAL REPORT 2020/2021HSA BOARD HSA BOARD AS AT AUGUST 2021 Mr Tai Lee Siang Head of Pillar, Architecture and Sustainable Design Singapore University of Technology and Design Professor Freddy Boey Deputy President (Innovation & Enterprise) National University of Singapore Professor Satkunanantham s/o Kandiah Chairman Health Sciences Authority Assoc Professor Benjamin Ong Deputy Chairman Health Sciences Authority Senior Vice President (Health Education and Resources) National University of Singapore Mr Jimmy Phoon Chief Executive Officer Seviora Holdings Pte Ltd Professor Leong Tze Yun Professor of Computer Science (Practice) National University of Singapore Director of AI Technology AI SingaporeMr Lin Qinghui Senior Director, Policy Development Division Ministry of Home Affairs Mr Lionel Y ee Woon Chin Deputy Pte Ltd Ms Aileen Tan Group Chief People and Sustainability Officer SingtelMr Alok Mishra Chief Executive Officer Value Addition 18 19 RISING TO THE CHALLENGEANNUAL REPORT 2020/2021HSA BOARD HSA EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE HSA BOARD COMMITTEES AS AT AUGUST 2021Board Executive Committee Chairman Professor Satkunanantham s/o Kandiah Members Assoc Professor Benjamin Ong Mr Lionel Y ee Woon Chin Ms Aileen TanBuilding Development Committee Chairman Mr Tai Lee Siang Head of Pillar, Architecture and Sustainable Design Singapore University of Technology and Design Co-Chairman Dr Choong May Ling, Mimi Chief Executive Officer Health Sciences Authority Members Mr Dileep Nair Independent Director Keppel DC REIT Management Pte Ltd Mr Jeffrey Wong Group Director Corporate Services Group Assoc Professor Sunil Sethi Group Director Applied Sciences Group Assoc Professor Chan Cheng Leng Group Director Health Products Regulation Group Dr Ang Ai Leen Group Director Blood Services Group Mr Loke Mun Sing Director Healthcare Infrastructure Projects Division Ministry of Health Holdings Mr Hoong Bee Lok Visiting Consultant Health Sciences AuthorityAudit and Risk Committee Chairman Mr Jimmy Phoon Members Professor Freddy Boey Professor Leong Tze Yun Mr Lin Qinghui BOARD UPDATES We would like to express our deepest appreciation to Mr Max Loh who retired from the Board on 31 March 2021.

W 01RISING TO THE CHALLENGEANNUAL REPORT 2020/2021HEALTH PRODUCTS REGULATION GROUP26 27 We conduct regular reviews of our regulatory processes to facilitate the latest developments in health products.REGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS AND REVIEWS OUR TIMELY RESPONSE TO THE PANDEMIC Facilitation of access to medical devices for COVID-19 In light of the demand for medical devices such as medical masks, COVID-19 diagnostic test kits, respirators and ventilators brought on by the pandemic, we exercised regulatory agility to ensure timely access to these critical medical devices while not compromising on their safety and effectiveness. This included establishment of the provisional authorisation route and providing relevant regulatory guidance such as guidance on the development of 3D printed medical devices. As part of our regulatory efforts, we also published a guidance document on our website in June 2020 that covered the key regulatory requirements for decontamination devices and good practices for healthcare institutions and other user facilities. Conditional authorisation of Veklury (remdesivir) In response to the urgent public health demands for remdesivir during the COVID-19 pandemic, HSA facilitated early access to the medicine through a conditional approval route in June 2020. This was subject to submission of data from ongoing clinical studies and manufacturing testing to ensure the continued safety and efficacy of the product. As of 31 March 2021, these devices were granted authorisation under the provisional authorisation route: Ventilators5 Decontamination devices3COVID-19 diagnostic test kits180 Ensuring safety standards of medical masks Due to the surge in demand for medical masks in Singapore, many local companies (including those from non-medical related industries) responded by applying to set up mask manufacturing facilities. To ensure the quality and performance of locally manufactured masks, HSA set up a virtual inspection and desktop review process to ensure compliance with international standards. Pandemic Special Access Route (PSAR) We introduced PSAR in December 2020 to facilitate early access to critical novel vaccines, medicines and medical devices required during pandemic situations. PSAR enables HSA to prioritise the review of critical COVID-19 vaccines and treatments through a rolling submission process, where companies can submit real-time data as and when they are available from ongoing studies. This allows HSA to start the evaluation early while the clinical and quality studies are concurrently underway, instead of having to wait for the full dataset to be submitted before evaluation can commence under the usual regulatory process. HSA has expedited the access to two COVID-19 vaccines through PSAR interim authorisation, while ensuring scientific rigour in the assessment of quality, safety and efficacy. Remote inspections during COVID-19 circuit breaker and phased transition periods With inspections being affected by COVID-19 safety measures, we turned to the use of secure technology platforms that allowed visual and audio communications to perform virtual inspections of the premises of licensed manufacturers and dealers, as well as retail pharmacies and clinical trials. This approach enabled us to ensure that these companies complied with regulatory requirements, including Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) and Good Distribution Practice (GDP) standards to ensure the continued supply of safe and good quality medicines. It also allowed us to continue our Good Clinical Practice (GCP) inspection of clinical trials, including the electronic trial master files and electronic data capture systems used in the clinical trials, and to interact with sponsor representatives from different time zones.COVID-19 clinical trials, investigating novel antiviral agents, monoclonal antibody treatments, cell therapy and vaccines have been approved since the start of the pandemic171STSingapore was the Asian country to approve the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine and Moderna COVID-19 vaccine, on 14 December 2020 and 3 February 2021, respectivelyRISING TO THE CHALLENGEANNUAL REPORT 2020/2021HEALTH PRODUCTS REGULATION GROUP28 29 NEW REGULATIONS FOR CELL, TISSUE AND GENE THERAPY PRODUCTS (CTGTP) CTGTP are a novel and innovative class of health products. In February 2021, we gazetted 1 1 pieces of subsidiary legislation for CTGTP. The CTGTP regulations were implemented under the Health Products Act on 1 March 2021. Prior to this, HSA had conducted extensive focus group discussions and public consultations with a diverse group of stakeholders. The collaborative efforts, valuable feedback and contributions of our stakeholders enabled the implementation of fit-for-purpose, risk-based regulations that support product development and commercialisation of these medically important therapies. The regulations also facilitate patients' access to novel products that meet the appropriate standards of safety, efficacy and quality. MANAGEMENT OF NITROSAMINE CONTAMINATION IN MEDICINES HSA continues to adopt a system-wide coordinated approach to manage the issue of nitrosamine contamination in medicines. Our efforts include: Collaborating closely with international regulators to discuss and formulate appropriate measures to address this issue to safeguard public health Engaging industry stakeholders to review the risk of nitrosamine contamination in their products and to mitigate any identified risk We have also been working with companies dealing with angiotensin receptor blockers (such as losartan and valsartan), which belong to a group of high blood pressure medicines, to review their manufacturing processes and implement changes to mitigate the risk of nitrosamine formation by December 2021. In April 2020, we organised a virtual stakeholder briefing to clarify HSA's regulatory approach in managing this issue of nitrosamine contamination, to communicate the actions required by stakeholders and to address their concerns. of the feedback received rated the briefing as useful in enhancing the understanding of HSA's requirements90%Around Over 200industry stakeholders attended the briefing As of March 2021, more thanof locally registered products were on track to meet the December 2021 deadline85%Inspection of a COVID-19 vaccine manufacturer in China In December 2020, we successfully conducted a GMP inspection of a COVID-19 vaccine manufacturing facility in China. In order to meet the tight and rigorous travel requirements, we had to start our travel nearly three weeks before the actual inspection date. During the process, we also received cross- agency support from Singapore's Economic Development Board and Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which assisted with expeditious travel approvals, special clearances and logistic arrangements. HSA's role in ensuring that overseas manufacturing facilities supplying COVID-19 vaccines to Singapore comply with international quality standards, and the importance of close inter- governmental agency support were amply demonstrated in this mission.Photo credit: Marken Time Critical Express Limited (Singapore Branch)Building our capability in ultra-low temperature (ULT) cold chain vaccines handling To ensure that we were able to handle ULT vaccines in our national vaccination programme, we have: Provided guidance and advice to distributors on ULT cold chain requirements (-70 degrees Celsius), as well as the storage and transport systems required Supported applications for Good Distribution Practice (GDP) Certifications and conducted audits to assess that companies' quality management systems complied with GDP requirements Reviewed temperature charts from temperature loggers accompanying vaccine shipments during transportation to ensure that transportation conditions were in order before the COVID-19 vaccines were released for use As of March 2021, HSA has received and approved 4GDP Certifications 2amendment applications for adding cold chain storage capabilities to dealers' licences RISING TO THE CHALLENGEANNUAL REPORT 2020/2021HEALTH PRODUCTS REGULATION GROUP30 31 Guideline Details Collaboration with the Ministry of Health (MOH) for the MOH- AI Guideline for Safe Development and Implementation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Healthcare Guideline on changes relating to the new regulatory frameworks for Medical Devices Regulation (MDR) and In Vitro Diagnostic Regulation (IVDR) New regulatory guideline for 3D Printed Medical Devices (3DP MDs) HSA addressed the risks present in the development and implementation of AI medical devices (AIMDs) in healthcare settings The purpose of the guideline is to encourage partnership between developers and implementers to ensure patient safety The guideline is targeted to be launched in the second half of 2021 The European Union (EU) introduced two new regulations \u2014 MDR and IVDR, in place of the current Medical Devices Directive (MDD) As a result of this change, revisions to device labelling and instructions for use on a significant number of medical devices are expected as many devices in Singapore share common labelling with those supplied in EU This new guideline serves to provide clarity on the changes which would require submissions to HSA The proposed guideline went through a focus group session in July 2020 and was finalised in October 2020 3D printing allows for the production of medical devices matched to an individual's specific anatomy This new guideline for 3DP MDs serves to differentiate mass-produced from custom-made 3DP MDs and explain the regulatory controls involved The guideline was published in January 2021 for consultation and is expected to be finalised in Q3 2021NEW REGULATIONS AND GUIDELINES To ensure our stakeholders fully understand the impact of new regulations, we came up with several guidelines over the year-in-review. PUBLISHING OF BENEFIT-RISK ASSESSMENT SUMMARY REPORTS In June 2020, we began publishing summary reports of benefit-risk assessments for approved new chemical and biologic entities on our website. Through this initiative, we aim to enhance regulatory transparency through open communication with stakeholders and the public. This is in line with current international best practices among global regulatory agencies and is beneficial for companies that may wish to leverage HSA's assessments as part of their filing strategy to jurisdictions that offer reliance pathways, as they can now freely access HSA's assessments and use the reports to support their regulatory filings in those countries. IMPLEMENTATION OF REVISED HEAVY METAL LIMITS FOR COMPLEMENTARY HEALTH PRODUCTS (CHP) From September 2020, it has become mandatory for all CHP in the local market to comply with the revised limits of heavy metals. These limits have been revised to enhance consumer safety and align with international standards such as those set by the World Health Organization and ASEAN. Additionally, it will also help facilitate entry into other markets for companies dealing with such products. To support these new limits, HSA has provided guidance to the industry on ways to minimise heavy metal contamination in CHP . ROLLING OUT OF NEW E-PHARMACY FRAMEWORK In light of the increasing prevalence of telemedicine, HSA rolled out a new e-pharmacy framework for the dispensing of medicines in May 2020. This new framework covers the following safeguards to ensure patient safety: Closed loop system for the transmission of e-prescriptions to prevent prescriptions from being changed or reused by the patients, enable traceability to the prescribing doctor, and guard against cybersecurity threats Clear procedures and practices for the storage, packing, labelling, and secure delivery of medicines to the intended patients in accordance with the e-prescriptions received, and with the appropriate professional supervision by a qualified pharmacist A strict policy to prevent dispensing of medicines containing controlled substances STREAMLINED REQUIREMENTS FOR STABILITY DATA HSA has introduced a streamlined approach for stability testing of multiple manufacturing sites for the same therapeutic product. This new approach allows the utilisation of stability data generated by one manufacturing site to support the shelf-life of the same product manufactured at another site when scientifically justified, thereby minimising the need for each manufacturing site to generate its own set of data. RISING TO THE CHALLENGEANNUAL REPORT 2020/2021HEALTH PRODUCTS REGULATION GROUP32 33 NEW STREAMLINED DOCUMENT SUBMISSION PROCESS A new FormSG form has been introduced to streamline the submission of post-approval data and documents to fulfil therapeutic products registration conditions. Highlights of this new form include: Ability to include multiple products sharing the same registration condition in one single submission Access to control via Corppass for added data security Elimination of multiple submissions for greater process efficiencyWe continually streamline and enhance our processes to deliver the greatest value to all our stakeholders.STREAMLINING AND ENHANCING OUR PROCESSES ENHANCED CHP CLASSIFICATION TOOL In September 2020, we launched an enhanced CHP classification tool. This new tool features a more user-friendly search function, ingredient-specific advice and guidance for compliance with current controls. We have received positive feedback that the new tool is more efficient and informative. Since the release of our enhanced CHP tool, usage rate has increased by nearly 33% ENHANCED ACCESS TO SAFETY INFORMATION In line with HSA's ongoing digital transformation efforts, we have launched two new safety initiatives. The first seeks to ensure that healthcare professionals have easy and on- demand access to trusted safety information on therapeutic products, and cell, tissue or gene therapy products either through our website or email. Healthcare professionals can access educational materials for their patients or themselves through a dedicated webpage, or subscribe to email updates regarding new postings on the HSA website. The second is an online survey which was conducted to better understand how healthcare professionals currently obtain safety information on therapeutic products from HSA, and the barriers faced in accessing our communication channels. Data obtained from this survey will help us identify potential areas for improvement.SURVEILLANCE OF LOCAL PRODUCT DEFECTS Over the year-in-review, more than 180 cases of product defects relating to locally registered therapeutic products were reported. The top three issues were related to:Ensuring the safety and quality of health products rank amongst our top priorities.STAYING VIGILANT cases63Manufacturing defects: cases47Product packaging defects: cases22Product contamination: In response, HSA worked with companies to ensure that the appropriate corrective and preventive actions were taken to mitigate the impact on the safety and quality of the defective therapeutic products and their future batches.

The objective of the workshop was to bring about a fundamental understanding of the principles behind effective regulation of IVDD and equip participants to make an informed decision when planning for the development, market entry and management of such devices. Our speakers covered the following topics: Regulatory requirements of IVDD throughout the product life cycle Roles of standards and guidelines Post-market surveillance REGULATION OF SOFTWARE AS A MEDICAL DEVICE (SAMD) WORKSHOP In December 2020, Duke-NUS CoRE organised a two-day workshop on the regulation of SaMD, and its related standards and guidelines. The workshop which was targeted at industry professionals and academia, discussed the increasingly important role of software in medical devices that deliver critical healthcare services, as well as the importance of regulating them. HSA was invited to share our approach in regulating SaMD through the software life cycle, including pre-market, post-market and change management controls. We also shared case studies to illustrate the importance of proactive monitoring in ensuring the safe and effective use of devices. Additionally, we took the opportunity to share our regulatory approaches for AI during the workshop as we noted the increased use of AI in healthcare settings.As the authority on health products regulation, we are always ready to share our expertise and knowledge with our stakeholders and partners.

At the official launch of SS 656 in September 2020, HSA was invited to speak at the webinar alongside other prominent speakers from around the world, covering topics such as how the standard can be applied in R&D, commercialisation of in vitro diagnostic products, clinical diagnostics and medical device regulation. IMPLEMENTATION OF MEDICAL DEVICE UNIQUE DEVICE IDENTIFICATION (UDI) SYSTEM IN SINGAPORE In October 2020, HSA hosted a webinar to engage stakeholders, as well as gather feedback on the plans for the phased implementation of the UDI System in Singapore. The UDI System is a globally harmonised system that facilitates unambiguous identification of medical devices through their distribution and use. It offers medical device manufacturers, distributors and healthcare providers a way to enhance traceability and identification of medical devices (e.g. during post-market actions, or recording of medical device use in patients). Implementation of UDI in Singapore is expected to take place in phases from 2022, starting with high-risk implantable medical devices, followed by other Class D, C and B devices. BOLSTERING OUR INTERNATIONAL LINKS To maintain our world-class standing, we continued to foster strong ties with overseas partners. INTERNATIONAL MEDICAL DEVICE REGULATORS FORUM (IMDRF) Despite being the Chair of IMDRF in a year (2020) that was overshadowed by the COVID-19 pandemic, we managed to successfully organise the following events: First-ever virtual IMDRF Management Committee meeting Stakeholders' forum Joint cybersecurity workshop with the Global Diagnostic Imaging, Healthcare IT & Radiation Therapy Trade Association (DITTA) We were also formally endorsed as a member of the IMDRF National Competent Authority Report exchange programme, which seeks to facilitate the exchange of post-market safety information on medical devices amongst global regulatory authorities, and trigger the rapid adoption of field safety corrective actions to better safeguard patients' health and safety. new working group on artificial intelligence medical devices1EstablishedDuring our 2020 IMDRF chairmanship, we: Finalised 10procedural and technical guidance documents3Approved new work item extensions on medical device adverse events terminologies, cybersecurity and personalised medical devices RISING TO THE CHALLENGEANNUAL REPORT 2020/2021HEALTH PRODUCTS REGULATION GROUP38 39 We are committed to serving our local stakeholders through various outreach programmes.LOCAL OUTREACH PROGRAMMES STANDARDISED PACKAGING (SP) FOR TOBACCO PRODUCTS As of 1 July 2020, all tobacco products sold in Singapore come in standardised packaging with enlarged graphic health warnings (\"the SP Measure\"). The SP Measure applies to all tobacco products, including cigarettes, cigarillos, cigars, beedis, ang hoon and other roll-your-own tobacco products. To help tobacco manufacturers, importers, wholesalers and retailers prepare and adjust, they were given a notice period of 12 months starting from 1 July 2019. During this period, we regularly sent our officers, as well as letters and circulars, to remind tobacco licensees of this new measure. INAUGURAL VIRTUAL ROADSHOW ON ADVERSE EVENT (AE) REPORTING In September 2020, we held our inaugural virtual roadshow on the importance of pharmacovigilance and AE reporting for healthcare professionals in Sengkang General Hospital. The session was met with encouraging feedback from participants and demonstrated HSA's agility in adapting to new situations brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic.INCREASE IN THE MINIMUM LEGAL AGE (MLA) FOR TOBACCO As part of Singapore's ongoing efforts to reduce smoking prevalence, the MLA for the purchase, use, possession, sale and supply of tobacco products was raised from 20 to 21 years old on 1 January 2021. We sent notifications and new signage stickers to all tobacco retailers to help them prepare for the revised age restriction. Our officers also engaged with tobacco retailers to remind them about the new law during routine inspections. 1ST roadshow conducted at Sengkang General Hospital Over comprising doctors and pharmacists attended100participants PARTICIPATION IN PHARMACEUTICAL SOCIETY OF SINGAPORE PHARMACY WEEK 2020 In October 2020, we participated in Pharmacy Week's virtual carnival organised by the Pharmaceutical Society of Singapore (PSS). Pharmacy Week is a public event organised annually by PSS to educate the public on the safe and effective use of medicines. As part of our ongoing public education initiative to raise awareness on the side effects of health products and medicines, HSA participated in a panel discussion. We also delivered a talk about the dangers of purchasing health products from dubious sources online and advised the public to consult healthcare professionals when in doubt. The video recording of the talk was posted on the PSS website together with HSA's video about the dangers of purchasing health products from dubious sources online.

The findings of this study will allow HSA to evaluate the pharmacogenetics associations of serious skin reactions in the local population, and to formulate genotyping recommendations at a national level. PROJECT AGREEMENT WITH A*STAR TO DEVELOP TESTING CAPACITY FOR COVID-19 VACCINES In September 2020, HSA signed a project agreement with the Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR) Bioprocessing Technology Institute to develop new in-house capabilities for the testing of locally manufactured or imported COVID-19 vaccines. Areas of collaboration include setting up and validating test methods for independent analytical testing of COVID-19 vaccines, as well as training new HSA officers to perform lot release testing functions. KNOWLEDGE EXCHANGE Over the year-in-review, we collaborated with international partners to share and build up our knowledge and expertise. THAILAND'S FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION (FDA) RELIANCE- BASED PROGRAMME In September 2020, Thailand's FDA started their reliance-based programme, which allows them to leverage HSA's evaluation reports of Singapore-registered medical devices*. The initial pilot programme has successfully concluded with 12 reports shared, and will now become a mainstay programme between the two regulators. The next phase of the programme will additionally include capacity building sessions through virtual platforms. *With due consent from local registrant companies PROJECT ORBIS Project Orbis is an ongoing collaboration with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Oncology Centre of Excellence to provide a framework for concurrent submission and review of oncology products among international regulatory health authorities.5applicationsThrough this collaboration, HSA issued regulatory approvals for ACCESS CONSORTIUM Previously known as ACSS Consortium, it was renamed in October 2020 to Access Consortium.

BLOOD SERVICES GROUP ven as we strive to uphold the highest standards in blood banking, we also endeavour to make the blood donation process as convenient and safe as possible. E 02RISING TO THE CHALLENGEANNUAL REPORT 2020/2021BLOOD SERVICES GROUP50 51 We believe in continuously raising the bar and improving the blood donation experience for our donors.IMPROVING THE BLOOD DONATION PROCESS BLOOD BANK USER RESEARCH PROJECT In September 2020, we embarked on a Blood Bank User Research Project with Singapore Polytechnic to develop strategies to improve the blood donation experience for both donors and staff, and strategies to engage and retain donors to become regular donors. As part of our development process, we created a user journey map using different donor personas to gain deeper insights into our current processes. We also worked closely with donors, blood bank staff and Singapore Red Cross staff to co-create solutions. In line with HSA's efforts to embrace digitalisation, one of our ideas included digitalising functions such as a donor guide, personalised check-in, donation milestone accomplishments, donation care tips and appointment sharing. With the project completed in March 2021, it is envisioned that we will soon be able to roll out these new initiatives that can improve donor and staff satisfaction, as well as grow our pool of regular donors. BETTER COMMUNICATION REGARDING THE BLOOD DONATION PROCESS As part of our continuous improvement efforts, we introduced a donation flow checklist in July 2020 to ensure that donors follow the streamlined blood donation process and do not miss any blood donation station. For further clarity, we also came up with signage to highlight the various blood donation stations and provided additional verbal reminders to donors to proceed to the next station. So far, donors have commended the usefulness of the posters in reminding them about the order of stations, while staff have found the checklist to be helpful in identifying donors who may have missed out any of the stations prior to blood donation. We stepped up and navigated the challenges brought on by the pandemic to secure our blood supply.COVID-19 AND BLOOD BANKING ENSURING ADEQUATE BLOOD SUPPLY FOR PATIENTS The COVID-19 pandemic had an impact on the blood supply, especially during the early phase of the pandemic and during the Circuit Breaker period when the blood collection dipped. To protect the safety of our blood donors and to reassure blood donors and the general public so that they would continue to come forward to donate blood, we rolled out a number of additional precautionary measures such as: Pre-screening of donors before they enter the blood donation centres and blood mobiles Safe management measures such as placing the donation beds as far apart as possible Increased frequency of cleaning of blood banks With the support of our donors, partners and stakeholders, we managed to bring the blood supply back to healthy levels.ESTABLISHING SINGAPORE'S CONVALESCENT PLASMA PROTOCOL HSA worked with the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) and Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH) to establish the COVID-19 Convalescent Plasma protocol for Singapore. We shared our donor selection and blood collection protocols, and trained staff from TTSH to enable them to collect convalescent plasma from recovered COVID-19 patients. We also extended our service to test and process COVID-19 convalescent plasma for patients' use. RISING TO THE CHALLENGEANNUAL REPORT 2020/2021BLOOD SERVICES GROUP52 53 We are committed to our mission of providing safe blood for patients in Singapore.RAISING BLOOD SAFETY STANDARDS ADDITIONAL SAFETY PROTOCOL FOR PATIENTS WITH NO BLOOD GROUP RECORD To prevent the occurrence of incompatible blood transfusions, matching of patient's blood group needs to be performed and historical records are typically used as a means of additional verification. However, this can prove problematic in cases where patients have no historical blood group records. To enhance transfusion safety, an additional blood sample from patients with no historical blood group records is now required for the confirmation of the patient's blood group. IMPLEMENTATION OF HEPATITIS E VIRUS (HEV) SCREENING In 2017, we identified HEV as a potential transfusion transmissible infection through our Risk-Based Decision Making Framework. After subsequent studies, including a viraemia and seroprevalence study in 2017 and 2018, we proposed that universal blood donation testing by molecular method would be the most appropriate risk management strategy for detecting HEV in donated blood and to ensure the safety of the blood supply in Singapore. As of June 2021, donor HEV testing has been included as part of our routine screening protocol. Through smarter working processes, we are empowered to deliver greater value to all our stakeholders.INCREASING OUR EFFICIENCY USING ROBOTIC PROCESS AUTOMATION (RPA) TO ENHANCE OUR PRODUCTIVITY Maintaining records manually is a time-consuming process. Using RPA, we managed to reduce the time spent on these tasks significantly. RPA for maintaining blood transfusion records On a typical day, we receive hundreds of blood transfusion records from all hospitals. Our staff then spend hours downloading patients' transfusion records and integrating them into our blood bank's IT system. Further contributing to the tediousness of the process was the need to manually retrieve and return erroneous records to the hospitals for correction.to complete instead of 2-3 hours previously, giving our staff more time to focus on other higher-value tasksWith RPA, the same task now takes only 2-3 minutes RPA for maintaining blood donation testing records We receive an average of 80 blood donation testing reports performed by external laboratories a month which had to be manually uploaded into our IT system, requiring eight man-hours of work. With RPA, we managed to reduce the time taken to upload these records by 80% From taking an average of 8 hours a month to upload records, we now take around 1.5 hours a monthRISING TO THE CHALLENGEANNUAL REPORT 2020/2021BLOOD SERVICES GROUP54 55 Digital transformation goes beyond the adoption of technology into our work processes. It also requires a change in the way we imagine and do things.DIGITALISATION INITIATIVES SWITCHING TO AN ONLINE DONOR FEEDBACK FORM By replacing our manual Blood Donor Feedback Form with FormSG, donors can now submit feedback online at their own convenience. This also improves our efficiency in collating and analysing their feedback, which was previously performed manually. each year towards higher value tasksWe have managed to channel more than 170 man-hours GOING PAPERLESS FOR BETTER EFFICIENCY Monitoring of temperature in the laboratories and equipment Maintaining the ideal temperature in the laboratories is important to ensure the accuracy and stability of tests. Recording of temperatures used to be done manually on paper logs. To improve the process of monitoring the temperature of laboratories and critical equipment, paper logs have now been combined into a single excel workbook, which is updated using a tablet. With this new system, logging is faster, records are cleaner, and abnormalities that require attention can be automatically flagged. This new system also automatically generates charts which allow for quick and efficient reviews of temperature deviations which occur in the laboratories. Monitoring the temperature of temperature- sensitive storage devices The daily temperature readings of storage devices were handwritten on hard copies, which could be messy. For greater convenience and to be more efficient, we introduced digital forms. The readings are now entered into an excel file stored in a tablet. Formulas are used to check if the temperatures are out of range and any deviations will be flagged out so that staff can take immediate action. Charts can be easily plotted to monitor the temperature trend and performance of the storage devices.DIGITALISATION OF ALL PATIENTS' DATA AND RECORDS Over the past year, we have been involved in an exercise to move all of our patients' data and records from 1987 into searchable PDF files. As of December 2020, we have successfully completed the user acceptance testing phase of our Digital Documentation and Online Forms project. By going digital, we have: Made retrieval of patients' records faster and easier Reduced physical storage formerly required to store hardcopy records Lowered our paper consumption Cut down the waiting time for clients requesting duplicate reportsUSING QR CODES TO FACILITATE RECORD-KEEPING For the Cell Therapy Facility, manually recording material and equipment information on hardcopy forms and electronic records would often result in transcription errors and discrepancies. To improve accuracy, we introduced the use of QR codes and a 2D barcode scanner, and converted most of the hardcopy forms into electronic records. With this new process, staff just need to scan the QR code to facilitate recording and auto-populate data. This eliminates transcription errors as well as reduces the time required by staff to log information by up to 80%.

WRISING TO THE CHALLENGEANNUAL REPORT 2020/2021APPLIED SCIENCES GROUP58 59 We are always refining and enhancing our techniques in the pursuit of higher efficiency. NEW AND IMPROVED TECHNIQUES DETECTING CONTAMINATION IN RIFAMPICIN PRODUCTS In February 2020, our overseas counterparts alerted us to the potential contamination of 1-nitroso-4-methylpiperazine (MNP) in rifampicin drug substances. As there were no standard tests for such analysis available internationally, we proceeded to develop our own testing methodologies. Our dedicated team was able to quickly develop a Liquid Chromatography Hybrid Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) test to quantitate the presence of MNP in rifampicin products. NEW METHOD TO PROCESS SAMPLES FOR HUMAN IDENTIFICATION Processing hard tissue samples such as bone and teeth in mass fatality incidents (MFI) is a difficult task that often yields less than satisfactory results. To improve our chances of successfully obtaining DNA profiles, we have implemented a new two-pronged method, which involves machine pulverisation of samples, as well as a semi-automated DNA extraction protocol.while improving the likelihood of obtaining a DNA profileWith our new MFI sample processing method, processing time can be reduced by up to 8x As of March 2021, a total of rifampicin products in Singapore have been analysed using our test method, producing responsive analytical results that have enabled us to take appropriate regulatory actions17INSIGHTS TO METABOLISM OF NEW PSYCHOACTIVE SUBSTANCES (NPS) Some of the challenges that we face in supporting enforcement agencies to detect the abuse of new psychoactive substances (NPS) include the constant emergence of new substances, as well as limited published metabolism data about such drugs. To tackle this issue, we collaborated with the National University of Singapore Pharmacy Department and the Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences from Ghent University, Belgium on an in vitro drug metabolism study that uses human liver microsomes (HLM) to identify NPS biomarkers. The result of this research project was published in the Archives of Toxicology in November 2020.RISING TO THE CHALLENGEANNUAL REPORT 2020/2021APPLIED SCIENCES GROUP60 61 ENHANCED DNA METHODOLOGIES Faster and more accurate DNA age prediction models In 2017, we successfully developed a model which could predict the age of a person based on a blood stain. Building upon that achievement, we have now come up with two new prediction models using an artificial neural network (machine learning) algorithm. The results of this project have since been published in a Nature Portfolios Journal \u2014 Scientific Reports. We are now able to better support the police with valuable DNA intel through our new prediction models, which: \u00b13.7Feature an enhanced accuracy of years; and 8xless input DNARequire First Y-STR profiling evaluation system in the world At HSA, a small team of four forensic DNA scientists process close to 5,000 Y -STR DNA profiles each month. To maximise efficiency, we implemented an expert system to automatically evaluate Y -STR profiles. This system requires minimal human input and automatically highlights samples with quality issues to the scientist for review. Analysis time has now been cut by up toWe are the1ST 65%in the world to implement such a system for Y-STR analysisThe problem: Identification of the active isomer is a crucial part of the pharmaceutical analysis of chiral drugs. However, previous analysis methods, using specialised chiral columns, were expensive and time-consuming.

These modifications relate to: We also held conversations with SPF regarding the handling of COVID-19 homicide cases, and provided our recommendations on the collection of evidence for forensic testing. These newly modified processes and guidelines are not restricted to COVID-19 and will be useful in future pandemics.The of the deceased from hospitalssafe transferThe of the deceased to the undertaker and next-of-kinsafe releaseBody identification in a bio-containment environment high level, COVID-19 AND HAND SANITISERS Due to a global shortage of pharmaceutical-grade ethanol during the COVID-19 pandemic, some manufacturers began to use lower-grade ethanol in their hand sanitiser products. To ensure public safety, we developed an analytical method utilising Gas Chromatography-High Resolution Accurate Mass (GC-HRAM) technology to detect a range of impurities in hand sanitisers. 96We analysed alcohol-based hand sanitisers in a market survey between April and June 2020of impurities or adulterated with methanol were recalledProducts that were found to contain levelsRISING TO THE CHALLENGEANNUAL REPORT 2020/2021APPLIED SCIENCES GROUP64 65 We push the boundaries of knowledge to stay at the forefront of scientific advancements. KNOWLEDGE AND INNOVATION GAINING INSIGHTS ON DNA DEPOSITION We are often approached by the courts to explain what affects DNA deposition. A key factor is the concept of \"shedder status\", which categorises individuals based on their propensity to deposit DNA via contact with a surface. Till now, studies on shedder status have largely been based on short-term data. To better support the courts and to gain further insights into this aspect of DNA deposition, we began a longitudinal study which followed the changes in shedder status of participants after a one-year interval. The study was presented at the 2020 Asian Forensic Sciences Network (AFSN) DNA workgroup. LOCALISED DATA ON DNA MIXTURE PROFILES Estimating the number of persons who contribute to a DNA mixture profile can be challenging due to a lack of data outside the Caucasian population. Hence, to better assist forensic DNA scientists in the region, we began a study on the use of simulated DNA mixture profiles based on the local Chinese, Malay and Indian populations. Through this study, we now have novel insights about the impact of allele dropout and the differences between intra-ethnic and inter-ethnic DNA mixtures. These key findings have since been published in Scientific Reports (a Nature Portfolio journal). ASSESSING AUTOMOTIVE PAINT EVIDENCE Recognising the data gaps that exist in our local population studies, especially in automotive distribution, we embarked on several automotive- related projects. These studies have helped us to better understand automotive paint characteristics and its significance in casework, as well as evaluate the discriminating power of our laboratory's standard paint examination protocol, which consist of visual and microscopical examinations, Fourier Transform Infrared (FT -IR) Spectroscopy and Scanning Electron Microscopy with Energy Dispersive X-ray (SEM/EDX) Spectroscopy. The discrimination study consisted of a comparative analysis of 256 paint samples from six colour groups. INTER-LABORATORY STUDY ON CANNABIS PRODUCTS The interpretation of the legality of cannabis products varies globally as a result of different quality control standards being developed and published in various pharmacopoeia. Seeking greater alignment, the Laboratory Coordination and Scientific Support Unit of Health Canada organised an international collaborative study to determine specific cannabinoids (tetrahydrocannabinol, tetrahydrocannabinolic acid, cannabidiol and cannabidiolic acid) in cannabis products. HSA was one of the participants in this study, which together with other government laboratories from Canada, Germany, UK, Australia, USA, The Netherlands and Switzerland are working to establish an internationally recognised testing approach. The outcome of this study will be presented at international meetings involving regulatory groups, such as the International Laboratory Forum on Counterfeit Medicines, the Permanent Forum on International Pharmaceutical Crime and OMCL Network. RISING TO THE CHALLENGEANNUAL REPORT 2020/2021APPLIED SCIENCES GROUP66 67 In the spirit of cooperation, we continued to share our knowledge and expertise with the local and international community.SHARING OUR EXPERTISE DNA DATABASING AND Y-STR ANALYSIS In September 2020, we were invited to share our experiences in DNA databasing and Y -STR analysis at the 44th European Network of Forensic Science Institutes (ENFSI) DNA Working Group meeting. Topics that we presented included our implementation of Y -STR analysis and statistical evidence to support law enforcement agencies, the insights on various statistical calculation methods, as well as the possibility of using Y -STRs to accurately predict ethnicity using a machine learning model. At the virtual 26th Annual National CODIS Conference in December 2020, we had the opportunity to present to the international community updates such as our recent establishment of the Y -STR database, as well as our implementation of the automatic profile evaluation system, which cuts the time taken to analyse Y -STR profiles by up to 65%. CRIMINAL LEGAL AID SCHEME (CLAS) TRAINING In August and September 2020, we conducted two virtual training sessions on drug abuse and DNA testing, where a total of over 400 criminal lawyers attended. The sessions helped these practising lawyers gain a better understanding of how HSA conducts testing in these areas. DVI WORKSHOP In December 2020, the Singapore Police Force organised the inaugural Disaster Victim Identification (DVI) Preparatory Workshop, which aims to equip designated personnel with the knowledge and skillsets for DVI operations during mass fatality incidents. As part of the workshop, HSA was invited to facilitate a session on the use of DNA in identification. The session covered both theory and practical components. DNA ANALYSIS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT EXHIBITS For the first National Sexual Assault Training virtual workshop organised by National University Hospital (NUH) and CID's Specialised Sexual Crimes Branch (SSCB) in February 2021, HSA was invited to deliver a presentation on the handling of sexual assault evidence. Topics that were covered during this session included an overview of forensic DNA techniques with a special focus on semen and DNA testing, current research initiatives undertaken to improve the analysis of sexual assault evidence, and overseas guidelines relating to the medical examination of sexual assault patients.The workshop was attended by over as well as counterparts from the Attorney- General's Chambers (AGC) and SSCBNUH staff, 70RISING TO THE CHALLENGEANNUAL REPORT 2020/2021APPLIED SCIENCES GROUP68 69 DELIBERATING ON WHO-ECDD RECOMMENDATIONS FOR CANNABIS AND CANNABIS-RELATED SUBSTANCES From 2019 to 2020, we were part of an inter-agency committee comprising Attorney-General's Chambers (AGC), Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA), Ministry of Health (MOH), Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) and Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), which was set up to deliberate on the World Health Organization Expert Committee on Drug Dependence's (WHO-ECDD) recommendations on cannabis and cannabis-related substances.

A high-speed camera was used to obtain impact footage and calculate the projectile's speed. COLLABORATION WITH IMMIGRATION & CHECKPOINTS AUTHORITY (ICA) In December 2020, we started a two-year collaboration with the Identity Authentication & Document Analysis Branch (IADA) of ICA on the examination of travel and identity documents. We plan to establish a framework for knowledge sharing and to build a database on common security features and forgeries found in such documents. DIGITALISATION IN THE LABORATORIES After three years of hard work, we successfully digitalised most of our routine workflows and achieved a near paperless environment, with the launch of our new Labware Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) in September 2020. The LIMS incorporates many digitalised workflows that enable data to move seamlessly across different sites and instruments, and the laboratories also utilise Robotic Process Automation (RPA) to replace some of the tasks which previously required human intervention. Some of the features include: Paperless submission/collection process for key stakeholders with system interface Automatic interface of analysis requests and results, and despatch of e-reports Implementation of e-inventory for tracking of chemicals, reagents and drug reference standards Digitalisation of laboratory processes, such as electronically capturing the movement of exhibits (chain of custody), case assignment, review and reporting Configuration to trigger and automate actions at various decision points, which greatly reduces human transcription and interpretation errorsThrough the thoughtful use of technology, we are able to continually raise our efficiency standards.LEVERAGING TECHNOLOGY We have also received positive feedback from users and stakeholders that the system has helped to streamline their operational processesAbout of our laboratories' workflows and processes have been digitalised80% AUTOMATING VIDEO ANALYSIS FOR VEHICLE SPEED CALCULATIONS We developed a Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) Excel macro to automate traffic accident reconstruction video speed calculations. hour per video1Manually calculating vehicle speed used to be a tedious process that tookOur new customised macro allows us to automatically extract data, perform calculations and plot graphs minutes5in justRISING TO THE CHALLENGEANNUAL REPORT 2020/2021APPLIED SCIENCES GROUP70 71 We maintain the highest standards of work by benchmarking to global standards.BENCHMARKING OURSELVES PROFICIENCY TESTING AND INTERNATIONAL COMPARISONS Over the year-in-review, we participated in various benchmarking programmes, achieving excellent results in the process.
