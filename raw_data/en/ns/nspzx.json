The vaccines administered to U.S. children are very safe, and serious side effects are extremely rare, according to a new study published in the journal Pediatrics. The findings should help to debunk the myth that vaccines cause autism and other disorders \u2014 a claim that has led parents to avoid or delay vaccinations and has triggered a resurgence of diseases, such as measles and pertussis, that U.S. health officials had long considered to be under control. As part of a project funded by the U.S. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, RAND researchers systematically reviewed scientific studies on routine vaccines recommended for children ages six and younger in the United States and the studies' findings on side effects among patients. The review concluded that, while some vaccines are associated with serious adverse events, vaccines are very safe overall, these side effects are extremely rare, and the tiny risk of side effects must be weighed against the great protection and benefits that these vaccines provide to both individuals and the public at large. Specifically, the review found A commentary accompanying the study points out that the benefits of vaccines far outweigh the risks of these uncommon side effects: \"[T]he adverse events identified by the authors were rare and in most cases would be expected to resolve completely after the acute event. This contrasts starkly with the natural infections that vaccines are designed to prevent, which may reduce the quality of life through permanent morbidities, such as blindness, deafness, developmental delay, epilepsy, or paralysis and may also result in death.\" This report is part of the RAND Corporation Research brief series.
