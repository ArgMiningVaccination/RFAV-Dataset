CONCEPT Essential Fatty Acids (EFAs) are nutrients required for many key functions in the human body, including cell growth, brain development, muscle activity, immune function, joint health, and many others. They are an essential part of cell membranes. While some fatty acids can be produced inside the body, \"essential\" fatty acids cannot be produced by our bodies; therefore, we rely on the food we eat to supply these important nutrients. The most common of the essential fatty acids are omega-6 and Omega-3 fatty acids. Modern science suggests that for optimal health, humans should consume a one-to-one ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 essential fatty acids. Unfortunately, due to the abundance of omega-6 fatty acids in vegetable oils and our increasing consumption of fried and fatty foods, a typical Western diet includes omega-6 fatty acids in a ratio as high as 20 to 1! While our diets must include some omega-6 fatty acids as essential nutrients for life, the disproportionate consumption of omega-6 fatty acids and other unhealthy hydrogenated or trans fats has been linked to poor health. Studies also link low intake of Omega-3 fatty acids to reduced mood and cognitive function. Conversely, there is an enormous body of scientific evidence supporting the health benefits of increasing the dietary intake of Omega-3 fatty acids. Studies have shown that increasing Omega-3 fatty acid consumption has a positive effect on cardiovascular health and brain function, and promotes healthy immune function. Increased consumption of Omega-3 fatty acids has also been shown to have a positive impact on joint health and mobility, and on skin health. Restoring the balance between Omega-3 and Omega-6 fatty acids is an important step in keeping your body healthy. This can be done by decreasing your intake of unhealthy foods high in omega-6 fatty acids and increasing your intake of foods that aredTERRA Nutrition xEO Mega\u00ae Essential Oil Omega Complex2 These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration.

Fish is an excellent source of dietary Omega-3 fatty acids, but Omega-3s can also be found in canola oil and the oils of some nuts and seeds. One serving of xEO Mega\u00ae provides 900 milligrams of pure, micro- filtered marine lipids with 300 mg of EPA, 300 mg of DHA, and 65 mg of other Omega-3s. Added to this is 200 mg of plant-based, Omega-3 rich, Ahiflower seed oil, along with 50 mg of pomegranate seed oil. CPTG Certified Pure Tested Grade\u00ae Essential Oils xEO Mega also contains a proprietary blend of dTERRA CPTG Certified Pure Tested Grade essential oils that work in harmony with the Omega-3 fatty acids in xEO Mega. Clove oil and Thyme oil have antioxidant properties that protect xEO Mega from oxidation and rancidity. The essential oil blend also supports healthy immune function and has digestive calming effects, which makes taking xEO Mega as pleasant as it is healthful. The essential oils in xEO Mega also function as a natural preservative system that protects the Omega-3 fatty acids and lipid-soluble vitamins from oxidizing and going rancid. Marine-Sourced Oils dTERRA\u00ae uses marine Omega-3 oils that are among the best quality in the world. Both fish oils are tested for over 250 contaminants, and both fish oils are certified sustainable by the prestigious Friend of the Sea organization in Europe. ALA and SDA xEO Mega delivers a unique source of plant-based oils derived from the Ahiflower (Buglossoides arvensis). Our cold-pressed Ahiflower seed oil provides a concentrated source of both ALA and SDA, which the body can convert more easily to EPA. Both ALA and SDA promote cardiovascular health. ALA and SDA are produced by many plants, but because of the low amount of vegetables consumed in the standard American diet, they are often not consumed in adequate amounts. Our Ahiflower seed oil also delivers GLA, which may help support the health of joints, lungs, and the nervous system. Astaxanthin and Vitamin E Omega-3 fatty acids are important for circulatory and brain health.* The brain is made up of essential lipids that, as with the free lipids traveling in the circulatory system, are prone to degradation through free-radical oxidation. xEO Mega includes the powerful antioxidant carotenoid astaxanthin that helps protect against lipid oxidation in the brain and throughout the circulatory system. Astaxanthin provides powerful antioxidant and circulatory benefits, supports eye health, improves muscle strength and endurance, aids the liver and digestive system, supports skin health, and promotes healthy immune function. The astaxanthin used in xEO Mega is a standardized extract of microalgae cultivated in a pure water system and activated by light. In response to exposure to light, the microalgae produces astaxanthin as a defense mechanism against oxidation. The microalgae changes from a light green to a deep crimson red. The astaxanthin is then extracted from the microalgae, microfiltered, and standardized for potency. The astaxanthin is coupled with natural vitamin E to provide additional circulatory and systemic benefits as powerful antioxidant additions to the antioxidant essential oils in xEO Mega. Vitamin D xEO Mega also includes 20 mcg of natural Vitamin D. Vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin present in a limited number of foods such as fish, beef liver, cheese, egg yolks, and fortified dairy products. It can also be synthesized in the body when triggered by exposure to sunlight. Vitamin D plays an essential role in bone health and growth. As with the Omega-3 fatty acids in xEO Mega, vitamin D also plays an important role in promoting healthy immune function and a healthy response to oxidative stress. xEO Mega Essential Oil Omega Complex xEO Mega is a revolutionary approach to supplementing our diets with Omega-3 fatty acids and other fat-soluble nutrients that help support circulatory health, brain health, and optimal immune function among many other systemic benefits. This unique formula of lipid-soluble nutrients is packaged in small, vegetarian-friendly softgels. xEO Mega is formulated to be used daily with Microplex VMz\u00ae and Alpha CRS+\u00ae as a comprehensive dietary supplement foundation for a lifetime of vitality and wellness.3 These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration.

FAQ Q: Does xEO Mega need to be refrigerated? A: xEO Mega is designed to be stable at room temperature throughout its shelf life. However, refrigeration is recommended to extend shelf life or to maximize the potency of the fragile Omega-3 fatty acids. Q: Does xEO Mega need to be taken with food? A: xEO Mega should always be taken immediately before or right at the beginning of a full meal. Q: Is there a vegetarian version of xEO Mega (no fish)? A: vEO Mega\u00ae is available for those who do not wish to consume any animal-sourced ingredients. Q: Can my kids take xEO Mega instead of the IQ Mega\u00ae? A: xEO Mega is safe for children and the dose can be cut in half. However, IQ Mega provides a higher dose of Omega-3 fatty acids, which are critically important for the development years. For any questions please consult your child's pediatrician. Q: If I take the IQ Mega, do I need to take xEO Mega too? A: No, one or the other should be sufficient. Q: What fish is utilized in the marine Omega blend and what is the country of origin? A: Though the fishing ground may vary, the marine omega blend comes primarily from anchovy, sardine, and mackerel from the waters off the coast of Norway. Q: Why do I need the marine and land Omega blends? A: Each provides reliable and consistent sources of Omega-3 fatty acids. The body can convert ALA and SDA (plant based) into EPA and DHA; however, this conversion is variable among different individuals. EPA and DHA are extremely important to every cell in our body, and marine based oils deliver a concentrated source of these important Omega-3 fatty acids. With xEO Mega you get the benefits of both land and sea, with its multi-targeted approach to improving the internal balance of these vital nutrients. 4 These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration.
