Charity Care: Emergency, inpatient or outpatient medical care, including ancillary services, provided to those who cannot afford to pay and without the hospital's expectation of reimbursement (i.e., free care). It does not include bad debt, defined as the unpaid accounts of any person who has received medical care or is financially responsible for the cost of care provided to another, where such person has the ability but is unwilling to pay. Emergency Services: Services requiring evaluation and initial treatment of medical conditions caused by trauma or sudden illness. Healthy San Francisco: A program created by local ordinance designed to make health care services available and affordable to uninsured San Francisco residents. Inpatient Services: Services provided to patients who are admitted to a hospital Medi-Cal Shortfall: The unreimbursed cost of providing services to the hospital's Medi-Cal patients Outpatient Services: Medical services provided without a hospital admission, excluding emergency services Safety Net Hospital: Hospitals that typically provide significant portions of their care to low-income, uninsured, and vulnerable populations Traditional Charity Care: Care provided to under- or uninsured patients not enrolled in HSF, and may be ineligible for Medi-Cal Underinsured: A population with health coverage insurance, but face significant cost sharing or limits on their insurance benefit that may affect its usefulness in accessing or paying for needed health services 5 SECTION I: EXECUTIVE SUMMARY San Francisco's Charity Care Ordinance (Ordinance 163-01) was designed to promote transparency in the provision of charity care among local non-profit hospitals and highlight the community services that hospitals provide in exchange for the benefits resulting from their tax-exempt status. This annual report, required by the Ordinance, provides a forum to share and examine the charity care data provided by hospitals, and also explore the changes in the charity care landscape, most notably in relation to recent local, state, and national policy changes and the ongoing COVID pandemic. This report reflects two years of new data, 2020 and 2021. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and emergency response by the San Francisco Department of Public Health, the reporting processes was delayed. Therefore both 2020 and 2021 data were combined into one report. This report includes a section dedicated to City-wide trends and another section that provides hospital-specific data, as trends may differ between hospitals. This report also includes a section that details health coverage and demographic data of the non-Healthy San Francisco (HSF) traditional charity care patient population from the previous five years. Charity Care is defined as emergency, inpatient or outpatient medical care, including ancillary services, provided to those who cannot afford to pay and without the hospital's expectation of reimbursement (i.e., free care). It does not include bad debt, defined as the unpaid accounts of any person who has received medical care or is financially responsible for the cost of care provided to another, where such person has the ability but is unwilling to pay. The annual report captures charity care data in two categories: Traditional charity care, which is defined as the care provided to under- or uninsured patients who are not enrolled in HSF, and may be ineligible for Medi-Cal. Healthy San Francisco (HSF) charity care, which is provided by hospitals as part of their participation in local HSF program. HSF is a program created by local ordinance designed to make health care services available and affordable to uninsured San Francisco residents. The following are the main conclusions of the report: A. Traditional Charity Care continues to serve the uninsured, those with public and commercial health coverage, and those most likely to experience health inequities - people experiencing homelessness, people of color, and people with lower socio-economic status. B. Charity Care patients and expenditures increased in San Francisco overall, however, many hospitals experienced decreased charity care patients during the reporting period, 2019 - 2021. C. Healthy San Francisco and Traditional Charity Care programs continue to serve distinct patient populations. 6 A. Traditional Charity Care continues to serve the uninsured, those with public and commercial health coverage, and those most likely to experience health inequities - people experiencing homelessness, people of color, and people with lower socio-economic status. Traditional charity care serves the uninsured, those with public and commercial health insurance, San Franciscans in districts with lower incomes, and persons experiencing homelessness. In 2021, traditional charity care patients were more likely to be Black/African American, Hispanic/Latinx, male, and older, compared to the overall city population. In 2021, 26 percent of traditional charity care patients identified as Hispanic/Latinx, for example, compared to only 17 percent of the San Francisco population. Black/African Americans make up 14 percent of traditional charity care patients, but only 5 percent of the San Francisco population. Overall, the demographic data indicates that those receiving charity care are also those most likely to be experiencing some of the most significant health inequities and have higher medical needs. For example, preventable hospitalizations are higher for Black/African Americans in San Francisco, compared to most other racial/ethnic groups. Additionally, the zip codes with the highest number of charity care patients - Districts 6 (SOMA and Tenderloin), 9 (Mission, Bernal Heights), 10 (SE Neighborhoods, including Bayview-Hunters Point) - have high preventable emergency room and poverty rates. Charity care therefore continues to be an important healthcare program for communities most likely to experience health inequities. B. Charity Care patients and expenditures increased in San Francisco overall, however, many hospitals experienced decreased charity care patients during the reporting period, 2019-2021. During the reporting period, there was an increase in the overall number of patients who received charity care in San Francisco. Between 2019 and 2021, there was a 13 percent increase in charity care patients, with traditional patients increasing 17 percent during this period. In absolute numbers, total charity care increased from 61,515 patients in 2019 to 69,508 patients in 2021. During this time, overall charity care expenditures increased from $121.8 million to $144.4 million (19 percent). Additionally, between 2019 and 2021, the number of charity care patients receiving inpatient services increased 22 percent (5,605 to 6,842 patients), while the number of charity care patients receiving outpatient services increased by 8 percent (42,891 to 46,251 patients). The number of charity care patients who received emergency services increased between 2019 to 2020 by 14 percent, and then decreased between 2020 and 2021 by 11 percent. In absolute numbers, there were 21,361 emergency patients in 2019; 24,300 patients in 2020; and 21,584 patients in 2021. The increases in charity care patients overall and across the three service types were primarily driven by two hospitals - UCSF and ZSFG. UCSF saw a 134 percent increase in charity care patients (4,166 to 9,763) from 2019 to 2021, and ZSFG saw a 17 percent increase in charity care patients (37,947 to 44,853) during the same period. Saint Mary's also saw a 39 percent increase (1,238 to 1,724) between 2019 to 2021. The other five hospitals - CPMC (Van Ness and Mission Bernal), Chinese Hospital, Kaiser, and Saint Francis - saw decreases in charity care patients between 2019 to 2021. 7 Charity Care Policy Changes at UCSF and ZSFG - Hospital-specific policy changes at UCSF and ZSFG, which saw the largest increases in charity care patients, were a driving factor in the observed overall increase in charity care. Collectively, these two hospitals represented 75% of charity care patients served at reporting hospitals in 2020 and 2021, and therefore changes in charity care at these intuitions have a disproportionate impact the citywide trends. Starting in FY 2021, UCSF began proactively applying charity care adjustments to patients understood to be qualified for financial assistance, without requiring an application from the patient. This change allowed UCSF to better target patients who met criteria for charity care, but may not have known, or been able, to apply. In February 2019, ZSFG amended its charity care and discount programs to add new patient financial protections and end patient balance billing (also referred to as \"surprise billing\"). These changes increased eligibility for Sliding Scale and Charity Care programs.1 The COVID-19 Pandemic: Healthcare Utilization and Healthcare Coverage Rates - The COVID-19 pandemic, and its health and economic effects, has had a significant impact on our healthcare system, which likely contributed to the observed decreases in charity care five out of the eight reporting hospitals. Most notably, the pandemic resulted in periods of decreased hospital utilization among all users of health care, including decreases in utilization of emergency, ambulatory, and inpatient services. According to the Department of Health Care Access and Information (HCAI), the average monthly number of Emergency patient encounters among the reporting hospitals was 19,185 between July 2019 - February 2020. This average decreased by 30 percent to a monthly average of 13,470 encounters between March - December 2020. Emergency utilization did not return to pre-pandemic levels in 2021, with an average of 15,497 encounters between January - December 2021. This represents an overall 19 percent decrease in emergency utilization when compared to pre-pandemic utilization (July 2019- February 2020).2 Overall declines in health care utilization were likely a contributing factor in the observed decreases in charity care patients among reporting hospitals. For ZSFG and UCSF, despite decreased overall hospital utilization during the reporting period, these hospitals still saw increases in charity care because more patients were eligible for and/or identified as in need of charity care due to their recently enacted policy changes. Healthcare coverage rates improved in California and San Francisco during the pandemic as a result of pandemic-related policy changes, including relaxing eligibility standards for the Medi-Cal program which increased the total number of individuals enrolled during the Public Health Emergency (PHE). According to data from the 2020 California Health Interview Survey (CHIS), 94 percent of all Californians were insured in 2020 - the highest rate of coverage among all Californians since CHIS began surveying respondents about their insurance coverage in 2001.3 In San Francisco, 96.4 percent of the population was insured in 2021.4 Further, Medi-Cal enrollment increased during the COVID pandemic. In San Francisco in April 2020, there 1DPH's Sliding Scale Program may be applied to services received in the San Francisco Health Network at Zuckerberg San Francisco General, in its primary care and affiliated clinics. The Sliding Scale Program is available to San Francisco residents who after thorough eligibility screening, are found to have no sponsorship, no federal, state or county insurance or program eligibility and are indigent or have limited income and would otherwise be unable to pay for the full costs for their medical services. 2 Cal HHS, Department of Health Care Access and Information (HCAI), Effects of COVID-19 on Hospital Utilization Trends, https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/effects-of-covid-19-on-hospital-utilization-trends 3 Tan, S.

Increased health coverage may have also contributed to a reduction in the overall need for charity care during this time period at certain reporting hospitals. C. Healthy San Francisco and Traditional Charity Care programs continue to serve distinct patient populations. Started in 2007, the Healthy San Francisco (HSF) program is a locally created and funded program that provides comprehensive, affordable healthcare to uninsured adults in San Francisco. HSF provides a medical home-based model, pairing each member with a primary care provider, to improve access to preventive, and coordinated care. Although not insurance, HSF provides participants with a stronger connection to the healthcare system through an organized system of care with benefits beyond hospital services. Today, HSF continues to primarily provide healthcare services to uninsured San Francisco adults who are ineligible for public full scope coverage through public programs. In addition to providing coverage, HSF provides outreach and assistance to help enroll those eligible for ACA-sponsored coverage, thereby increasing the accessibility of health insurance. Between 2019 and 2021, there was a 17 percent increase in traditional charity care patients (49,519 to 57, 913 patients) and a 3 percent decrease in HSF patients (11,996 to 11,595). When examining the types of charity care services provided through the two programs, the proportion of emergency care is higher for traditional charity care patients compared to HSF charity care patients. In 2021, 33 percent of all services for traditional charity care patients were emergency services, while 10 percent of all services for HSF charity care patients were emergency services. Additionally, the proportion of outpatient services is much lower for traditional charity care patients. In 2021, outpatient services were 56 percent of all services for traditional charity care patients, compared to 88 percent of all services for HSF charity care patients. 5 DHCS, https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/medi-cal-certified-eligibles-tables-by-county-from-2010-to-most-recent-reportable-month; Certified eligibles are those beneficiaries deemed qualified for Medi-Cal by a valid eligibility determination, and who have enrolled into the program. 9 SECTION II: THE SAN FRANCISCO CHARITY CARE ORDINANCE In 2001, the San Francisco Board of Supervisors passed the Charity Care Ordinance (Ordinance 163-01), which amended the San Francisco Health Code by adding Sections 129-138 to authorize the San Francisco Department of Public Health (DPH) to require hospitals to report on charity care policies, quantify the amount of charity care provided, and provide patient notification of charity care policies.6 This law was the first of its kind in the nation and has supported a spirit of public disclosure locally that has been replicated in other municipalities and by the federal government as part of healthcare reform, as evidenced by the ACA's reporting requirements. While it does not require hospitals to provide a specific level of free or discounted care to the community, San Francisco's Health Code does require DPH to report on the hospitals' charity care work in an annual report. To fulfill this requirement, DPH collects, analyzes, and presents these data for the San Francisco Health Commission each year. The annual charity care report allows readers to learn more about the health care provided to those who are under- or uninsured and least able to pay for health care services. San Francisco's Ordinance defines charity care as: \"emergency, inpatient, and outpatient medical care, including ancillary services, provided to those who cannot afford to pay and without expectation of reimbursement, and that qualifies for inclusion in the line item 'Charity-Other' in the reports referred to in Section 128740(a) of the California Health and Safety Code, after reduction by the Ratio of Costs- to-Charges.\" 7 The annual report captures charity care data in two categories: Healthy San Francisco (HSF) charity care, which is provided by hospitals as part of their participation in local HSF program; and traditional charity care, which is defined as the care provided to under- or uninsured patients who are not enrolled in HSF, and may be ineligible for Medi-Cal. To produce the annual report, DPH collaborates with eight reporting hospitals through the charity care project workgroup. According to the Charity Care Ordinance, there are five hospitals required to submit charity care data to SFDPH within 120 days after the end of their fiscal year.8 The other three hospitals are not mandated, but report the same charity care data voluntarily to SFDPH. 6 More information about the charity care ordinance and reporting hospitals is found in Appendix B and C. 7 CCSF Health Code, Article 3 (Hospitals), Section 130. Definitions. 8 Hospitals report either on a Jan-Dec or a July-June fiscal year. See Appendix A for details. 9 CPMC Davies data is reported under CPMC Van Ness Hospital, as they are under the same license.

It does not include bad debt, defined as the unpaid accounts of any person who has received medical care or is financially responsible for the cost of care provided to another, where such person has the ability but is unwilling to pay. The annual report captures charity care data in two categories: Traditional charity care, which is defined as the care provided to under- or uninsured patients who are not enrolled in HSF, and may be ineligible for Medi-Cal; and Healthy San Francisco (HSF) charity care, which is provided by hospitals as part of their participation in local HSF program. HSF is a program created by local ordinance designed to make health care services available and affordable to uninsured San Francisco residents.10 A. Traditional charity care continues to serve the uninsured, those with public and commercial health coverage, and those most likely to experience health inequities - PEH, POC, and Lower SES. Payor Status California's health insurance landscape has remained relatively stable, even considering the COVID pandemic's health and economic impacts. California's uninsurance rate declined to a historic low in the first year of the pandemic.11 In San Francisco, 96.4 percent of the population was insured in 2021, which is similar to years prior.12 However, there continues to be a number of San Franciscans that remain uninsured despite City-wide, state, and national efforts, and these individuals will continue to rely on charity care. Newly collected data from hospitals indicate that in 2021, 21 percent of total traditional charity care patients were uninsured. There are several factors that can lead to uninsurance, including personal circumstances that make it difficult to maintain coverage (e.g. homelessness), lack of awareness of program eligibility, immigration status, and affordability concerns in the face of rising healthcare costs. Another population that relies on traditional charity care are those with health coverage, including public and commercial insurance, but are unable to afford health care expenses. These individuals, who are referred to as underinsured, are more likely to delay care and have difficulty paying medical bills. Data from 10 To be eligible for Healthy San Francisco, you must be all of the following: a San Francisco resident, age 18 or older, uninsured, not eligible for public insurance programs such as Medi-Cal or Medicare, and living on a combined family income at or below 500% of the FPL. https://healthysanfrancisco.org/visitors/are-you-eligible/ 11 CHCF, California Health Insurance Stable in 2021, but May Will Need To Switch Coverage Once COVID-19 Pandemic Protections End, https://www.chcf.org/publication/california-health-insurance-stable-in-2021-but-many-will-need-to-switch-coverage-once-covid-19-pandemic-protections-end/ 12 U.S. Census, 2021: ACS 5-Year Estimates, https://data.census.gov/table?q=INSURANCE&g=0500000US06075&tid=ACSST5Y2020.S2701 11 hospitals shows that in 2021, 78 percent of traditional charity care patients had some form of health coverage. 13 Figure 1: Traditional Charity Care Patients by Payor Source, 2019 to 2021** * \"Other\" payor type includes those with commercial insurance and workers compensation. \"Uninsured\" indicates the number of patients who self-pay their medical expenses. ** Kaiser only reported 2021 data. Inclusion of Kaiser's 2021 data does not significantly change the overall distribution of payor source, and has therefore not been included in the above chart. Refer to Appendix G for Kaiser demographic data. Between 2019 and 2021, the proportion of uninsured charity care patients decreased from 32 percent to 21 percent, while the proportion of those with \"Other\" types of healthcare coverage, or those with commercial insurance and workers compensation, grew from 12 percent to 26 percent. At UCSF, the aforementioned change to \"presumptive\" charity begun in FY 2021, which resulted in more patients with \"Other\" payor type meeting the criteria for charity care. While Medi-Cal is considered comprehensive coverage, there are several reasons why recipients may receive charity care assistance. Some Medi-Cal recipients must pay a monthly dollar amount towards their medical expenses before their full scope Medi-Cal benefits become active. This expense is referred to as share of cost (SOC), and is determined based on a recipient's income. Some recipients may not be able to afford the SOC and might therefore be eligible for charity care assistance.14 Additionally, individuals who only qualify for restricted scope Medi-Cal - which covers certain services like Pregnancy or Emergency services - may receive additional non-covered care as a result of their initial emergency visits. Individuals on restricted scope Medi-Cal may not be able to afford these additional out-of-pocket expenses and therefore be eligible for charity care assistance. 13 It is important to note that patients' uncovered healthcare costs, which might lead them to charity care, is different from a hospital's Medi-Ca Shortfall, defined as the difference between total Medi-Cal expenditures for services to Medi-Cal beneficiaries and the total hospital reimbursement received from the Medi-Cal program. Medi-Cal shortfall is discussed in Section B. 14 At ZSFG, San Francisco residents with Medi-Cal SOC have the Sliding Scale program applied to their accounts. ZSFG does not ask patients to pay their Medi-Cal SOC. Instead, ZSFG tries to have the SOC met by posting the charges of services rendered to the patient during that calendar month in previous years, traditional charity care patients are primarily San Francisco residents (69 percent in 2021). Bay Area residents (14 percent) and persons experiencing homelessness (9 percent)15 represent the next largest proportion of charity care patients. Figure 2: Traditional Charity Care Patients Reported Residence, 2017 to 2021 Since 2013, the majority of the charity care patients in San Francisco have resided in Districts 6 (SOMA and Tenderloin), District 10 (SE Neighborhoods, including Bayview-Hunters Point), District 9 (Mission, Bernal Heights), and District 11 (Excelsior). District 1 (Northwest SF/Richmond) and District 8 (Castro, Mission) represent the smallest shares (about 2-4 percent each). 15 The decrease in persons experiencing homelessness from 2020 to 2021 (11% to 9%) is due to changes in data entry protocols at ZSFG during the reporting period. Address fields for people experiencing homelessness were imputed as the by Supervisorial District, 2017 to 2021 The increases in charity care patients from 2019 to 2020 in District 6 and District 9 are driven by an increase in ZSFG's charity care patient population with a 94110 zip code, where ZSFG is located. This may be attributed to changes in data entry protocols at ZSFG during the reporting period, where the address for people experiencing homelessness is now imputed as the facility's address.16 Demographic data was also collected on race/ethnicity, age, and gender. As in previous years, traditional patients were more likely to be Hispanic/Latinx, Black/African American, male, and older, compared to the overall city population. In 2021, 26 percent of traditional charity care patients identified as Hispanic/Latinx, compared to only 17 percent of the San Francisco population. Black/African Americans make up 14 percent of traditional charity care patients, but only 5 percent of the San Francisco population. Overall, the demographic data indicates that those receiving charity care are also those most likely to be experiencing some of the most significant health inequities and have higher medical needs. For a more detailed analysis of these demographic data points, refer to Appendix G. 16 This protocol was initiated in late 2019 and fully implemented in 2020. 14 1%1%1%1%1%0%19%14%16%12%13%36%15%15%16%15%14%5%1%2%2%2%2%0%1%1%1%2%2%0%10%11%12%22%16%1%3%2%2%2%2%0%24%24%24%27%25%41%26%30%26%17%26%17% 0%10%20%30%40%50%60%70%80%90%100% 20172018201920202021San FranciscoHispanic/LatinxWhiteUnknownOtherNH/PIDeclineBlack/AfricanAmericanAsianAI/ANFigure 4: Traditional Charity Care Patients by Race/Ethnicity** ** Kaiser did not report race/ethnicity data and are not included in the graph. B. Charity Care patients and expenditures increased overall, however, many hospitals experienced decreased charity care patients during the reporting period, 2019 - 2021. Charity Care Patients During the reporting period, there was an increase in the overall number of patients who received charity care in San Francisco. Between 2019 and 2021, there was a 13 percent increase in charity care patients, with traditional charity care patients increasing 17 percent during this period. In absolute numbers, total charity care increased from 61,515 patients in 2019 to 69,508 patients in 2021. This increase was driven by UCSF, which saw a 134 percent increase in charity care patients (4,166 to 9,763) from 2019 to 2021, and ZSFG, which saw a 17 percent increase in charity care patients (37,947 to 44,853) during the same period. Saint Mary's also saw a 39 percent increase (1,238 to 1,724) between 2019 to 2021. The other hospitals - CPMC (Van Ness17 and Mission Bernal), Chinese Hospital, Kaiser, and Saint Francis - saw decreases in charity care patients between 2019 to 2021. Between 2019 and 2021, there was a 3 percent decrease in HSF patients (11,996 to 11,595). 17 CPMC Davies data is combined with CPMC Van Ness data as they are under the same hospital license. 15 Figure 5: Unduplicated Charity Care Patients, 2017 to 2021 Figure 6: HSF and Traditional Charity Care Patients, 2017 to 2021 Charity Care Policy Changes at UCSF and ZSFG A key factor reported as contributing to the observed overall charity care increase were hospital-specific policy changes at the two hospitals that saw the largest increases in charity care patients. Starting in FY 2021, UCSF began proactively applying charity care adjustments to patients understood to be qualified for financial assistance, without requiring an application from the patient. This change allowed UCSF to better target patients who met criteria for charity care, but may not have known, or been able, to apply, and therefore may not have received charity care in previous years. This policy change was reported as a primary factor in the observed increase in charity care patients for UCSF. Additionally, in February 2019, ZSFG amended its charity care and discount programs to add new patient financial protections and end patient balance billing (also referred to as \"surprise billing\"). Changes included establishing out-of-pocket maximums for qualified patients of all income levels and making income-based discounts available to more qualified patients by expanding the income eligibility for the Sliding Scale, Charity Care, and Discount Payment programs. Sliding Scale Program eligibility expanded by eliminating the assets test criteria. Charity Care Program eligibility expanded from 350 percent of Federal Poverty Level (FPL) to 500 percent of FPL. Discount Payment Program eligibility expanded from 500 to eliminating an FPL limit. These policy changes were reported as a primary driver in the observed increase in charity care patients for ZSFG. The COVID-19 Pandemic: Healthcare Coverage Rates and Healthcare Utilization The COVID-19 pandemic, and its health and economic effects, has had a significant impact on the healthcare system nationally and locally. In San Francisco, through June 2022, there have been 928 COVID deaths, with a peak of 165 deaths in January 2021.18 Most notably, the pandemic resulted in periods of decreased hospital utilization, including decreased utilization of emergency, ambulatory, and inpatient services. According to the Department of Health Care Access and Information (HCAI), the average monthly number of emergency patient encounters among reporting hospitals was 19,185 between July 2019 - February 2020. This average decreased by 30 percent to an average of 13,470 encounters between March - December 2020. Emergency utilization did not return to pre-pandemic levels in 2021, with a monthly average of 15,497 encounters between January - December 2021. This represents an overall 19 percent decrease in emergency utilization when compared to pre-pandemic utilization (July 2019- February 2020).19 These overall decreases in utilization were reported as contributing to the decreases in charity care patients at the five reporting hospitals. For ZSFG and UCSF, despite decreased overall hospital utilization during the reporting period, these hospitals still saw increases in charity care because more patients were eligible for and/or identified as in need of charity care due to their recently enacted policy changes. The chart below shows overall hospital utilization across all reporting hospitals between July 2019 and December 2021 based on HCAI data. Dotted lines show baseline utilization before the start of the COVID pandemic, defined as July 2019 to February 2020.

According to data from the 2020 California Health Interview Survey (CHIS), 94 percent of all Californians were insured in 2020 - the highest rate of coverage among all Californians since CHIS began surveying respondents about their insurance coverage in 2001.21 In San Francisco, 96.4 percent of the population was insured in 2021.22 Further, Medi-Cal enrollment increased during the COVID pandemic. In San Francisco in April 2020, there were 203,885 Medi-Cal eligibles, and by December 2021, there were 233,570 Medi-Cal eligibles, representing a 15 percent increase.23 This increase was likely driven by the COVID public health emergency (PHE) related polices, where states received increased Medicaid funding from the federal government if they postponed Medicaid dis-enrollments during the PHE. This \"continuous coverage\" requirement allowed millions of Californians to stay on Medi-Cal.24 Increased health coverage may have also contributed to a reduction in the overall need for charity care during this time period at certain reporting hospitals. Charity Care Services Along with the increase in the number of total charity care patients between 2019 and 2021 in San Francisco, charity care patients receiving all three service types (emergency, outpatient, and inpatient) also increased among reporting hospitals during this period. The number of charity care patients receiving inpatient services increased by 22 percent (5,605 to 6,842 patients) during this time period, and the number of charity care patients receiving outpatient charity care services saw an eight percent increase (42,891 to 46,251 patients). Charity care patients receiving emergency charity care services increased between 2019 and 2020 by 14 percent, and then decreased between 2020 and 2021 by 11 percent (21,361 patients in 2019; 24,300 patients in 2020; and 21,584 patients in 2021). As with overall charity care patient numbers, increases in charity care patients who received emergency, outpatient, and inpatient care were driven by expanded charity care eligibility at ZSFG and UCSF. As in previous years, outpatient charity care services still represent the majority of overall charity care services provided. Note that outpatient services include only those services provided on a hospital's campus. The data suggests the importance and continued reliance on all types of charity care services. For a more detailed analysis of charity care by service type, please see APPENDIX H. 21 Tan, S.

The following year, charity care expenditures decreased between 2020 and 2021 from $156.5 million to $144.4 million (8 percent). Therefore, between 2019 and 2021, overall charity care expenditures increased by 19 percent from $121.8 million to $144.4 million. The increase in overall charity care expenditures from 2019 to 2020 was driven primarily by ZSFG. In February 2019, ZSFG amended its charity care and discount programs to add new patient financial protections and end patient balance billing (also referred to as \"surprise billing\"). This new policy was the primary driver of the observed increase in ZSFG's charity care expenditures between 2019 and 2021. From 2019 to 2020, ZSFG saw a 48 percent increase in charity care expenditures ($71.6 million to $105.7 million). Charity care expenditures at ZSFG then decreased between 2020 and 2021 by 6 percent ($105.7 million to $99.6 million); this resulted in an overall increase in charity care expenditures of 39 percent between 2019 and 2021 ($71.6 million to $99.6 million). 25 Further, reporting hospitals track Medi-Cal shortfall, defined as the difference between total Medi-Cal expenditures for services to Medi-Cal beneficiaries and the total hospital reimbursement received from the Medi-Cal program. Generally, hospitals must absorb the difference. Medi-Cal shortfall amounts may vary between hospitals, as the costs for health care services can vary from hospital to hospital. As charity care patients previously ineligible for health insurance may have enrolled in Medi-Cal, Medi-Cal shortfall is a 25 The expenditure increases at ZSFG surpassed the increases in costs of healthcare between January 1, 2019 to December 2021, which was 7 percent.

Across reporting hospitals, between 2019 and 2021, Medi-Cal shortfall increased less than one percent ($793.6 million to $799.8 million). Medi-Cal shortfall had been steadily increasing between 2018 and 2020. Medi-Cal enrollment increased during the reporting period, likely due to the COVID pandemic policy changes. For example, in San Francisco in April 2020, there were 203,885 Medi-Cal eligibles, while by December 2021, there were 233,570 Medi-Cal eligibles, representing a 15 percent increase in the eligible population.26 Despite an increase in Medi-Cal enrollment, hospitals still experienced decreased utilization due to COVID, leading to stable level of shortfalls year to year. Figure 9: Charity Care and Medi-Cal Shortfall (In Millions), 2017-2021 C. Healthy San Francisco and Traditional Charity Care programs continue to serve distinct patient populations. Started in 2007, the Healthy San Francisco (HSF) program is a locally created and funded program that provides comprehensive, affordable healthcare to uninsured adults in San Francisco. HSF provides a medical home-based model, pairing each member with a primary care provider, improving access to preventive and coordinated care. Although not insurance, HSF provides participants with a stronger connection to the health care system through an organized system of care with benefits beyond hospital services. HSF continues to primarily provide healthcare services to uninsured San Francisco adults who are ineligible for public full scope coverage. HSF also provides outreach and assistance to enroll those eligible for ACA-sponsored coverage, thereby increasing accessibility of health insurance. 26 DHCS, https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/medi-cal-certified-eligibles-tables-by-county-from-2010-to-most-recent-reportable-month; Certified eligibles are those beneficiaries deemed qualified for Medi-Cal by a valid eligibility determination, and who have enrolled into the there was 20 percent decrease in HSF patients (11,996 to 9,643) at reporting hospitals, which was followed by a 20 percent increase between 2020 and 2021 (9,643 to 11,595). Collectively there a 3 percent decrease in HSF patients at reporting hospitals between 2019 and 2021. These trends mirror the overall health care utilization trends during this time period. This policy will be discontinued in July 2023.27 Between 2019 and 2021, HSF charity care expenditures increased overall by 30 percent ($29 million to $37.6 million). Between 2019 and 2020, HSF expenditures increased by 6 percent ($68.4 million to $72.8 million). Figure 10: HSF and Traditional Charity Care Expenditures, 2017 to 2021 When examining the types of charity care services provided through the two programs, the proportion of emergency care is higher for traditional charity care patients compared to HSF charity care patients. In 2021, 33 percent of all services for traditional charity care patients were emergency services, while 10 percent of all services for HSF charity care patients were emergency services. Additionally, the proportion of outpatient services is much lower for traditional charity care patients. In 2021, outpatient services were 56 percent of all services for traditional charity care patients, compared to 88 percent of all services for HSF charity care patients. The greater use of emergency care among traditional charity care patients supports the contention that these patients are more likely to have higher acuity health conditions and less connections to primary and specialty care. 27 SFDPH Data. Note that total HSF expenditure data for 2021 was not available at the time the Charity Care Report was services for HSF and Traditional, 2019 to 2021 Since 2013, the majority of the charity care patients in San Francisco have resided in Districts 6 (SOMA and Tenderloin), District 10 (SE Neighborhoods, including Bayview-Hunters Point), District 9 (Mission, Bernal Heights), and District 11 (Excelsior). District 1 (Northwest SF/Richmond) and District 8 (Castro, Mission) represent the smallest shares (about 2-4 A number of factors may influence charity care delivery across hospitals, including patients' personal preferences, ambulance diversion, transportation, hospitals' service delivery mix, and geographic location, among others. This section provides city-wide trends in charity care patients, service utilization, expenditures, and Medi-Cal shortfall, and how these trends varied across the reporting hospitals. Unduplicated Patients Between 2019 and 2021, the number of charity care patients decreased for five of the eight reporting hospitals (CPMC - Van Ness and Mission Bernal, Chinese Hospital, Kaiser, and St. Francis). Three of the reporting hospitals (UCSF, ZSFG, and St. Mary's) saw an overall increase in the number of charity care patients. In 2020, there was a one-year spike in charity care patients for St. Francis and St. Mary's. Figure 12: Charity Care Patients Across Hospitals, 2017 to 2021 28 28 The increases of unduplicated charity care patients at UCSF and ZSFG are due to aforementioned charity care policy changes during the reporting period. Please refer to Section III, B for more information. 25,95734,75937,94740,61244,85323 The observed increase in charity care patients at UCSF, ZSFG, and St. Mary's, and decrease in charity care patients at CPMC - Van Ness and Mission Bernal, Chinese Hospital, Kaiser, and St. Francis, were primarily driven by each hospital's traditional charity care patients, as reflected below. Figure 13: Traditional Charity Care Patients Across SF Hospitals, 2017 of HSF charity care patients, between 2019 and 2021, four of the eight reporting hospitals saw decreases, while three hospitals saw overall increases. ZSFG is the primary provider for HSF charity care patients of reporting hospitals. Between 2019 and 2021, ZSFG's HSF charity care patient population fluctuated. From 2019 to 2020 the HSF charity care patient population at ZSFG decreased by 22 percent (10,975 to 8,513 patients), and from 2020 to 2021 increased by 30 percent (8,513 to 11,054 patients). Chinese Hospital is not included because they did not see HSF charity care patients. Figure 14: HSF Charity Care Patients Across SF Hospitals, and Charity Care Patient Residence The tables display eight San Francisco zip codes and the hospitals located in each zip code. The highlighted cells show numbers of charity care patients who are residents in that hospitals' zip code. Each hospital sees a large number of patients from within their corresponding zip code, indicating that these hospitals serve the communities where they are located. Since ZSFG is the county's safety net hospital, it serves the majority of traditional charity care patients for all zip codes. Additionally, many charity care patients travel within San Francisco for their choice of hospital.

The year following, between 2020 and 2021, charity care expenditures decreased by eight percent ($156.5 million to $144.4 million). Therefore, between 2019 and 2021, charity care expenditures increased overall from $121.8 million to $144.4 million (19 percent increase). ZSFG, as the county's safety net hospital, has historically, and continues to, provide the majority of charity care in the City. UCSF and CPMC are the second and third largest providers of charity care in the City, respectively. Figure 17: Percent of Total Charity Care Expenditures by San Francisco Hospitals, 2019 and 2021 Percent of Total Charity Care Expenditures by San Francisco Hospitals (excluding ZSFG), 2019 and 2021 Between 2019 and 2021, CPMC-Van Ness, CPMC-Mission Bernal, Chinese Hospital and Kaiser observed overall decreases in charity care expenditures. St. Mary's, Saint Francis, UCSF and ZSFG observed an overall increase in charity care expenditures between 2019 and 2021. HSF and traditional/non-HSF charity care expenditures because for most hospitals, other than ZSFG, HSF charity care represents a minor fraction of overall charity care expenditures. In 2021, total HSF expenditures was $37.6 million while total traditional charity care expenditures was $106.8 million. Figure 20: HSF and Traditional Charity Care Expenditures Across SF Hospitals (in Millions), 2017 to 202129 29 Precents represent percentage of expenditures spent traditional charity care. $7.7 33% 35% 38% 25% 33%36 % 30 Across reporting hospitals, between 2019 and 2021, Medi-Cal shortfall increased less than one percent ($793.6 million to $799.8 million). However, a closer look at individual time periods shows that between 2019 and 2020, the total Medi-Cal shortfall increased by $274.3 million (46 percent) and then decreased by $66.4 million (or 8 percent) between 2020 and 2021. Figure 21: Medi-Cal Shortfall Across SF Mary'sUCSFZSFG31 Another way to compare charity care trends in San Francisco is to review each reporting hospital's ratio of charity care cost compared to net patient revenue, which allows for a useful comparison of each hospital's charity care contribution relative to its size. For the purposes of this report, net patient revenue information is taken from the Department of Health Care Access and Information (HCAI) Annual Financial Reports submitted by each hospital.30 Note that Kaiser is excluded from this portion of the report, as the hospital is not required to report this information to HCAI. The figures below show each hospital's ratio of charity care expenditures (as reported to SFDPH), compared to the net patient revenue (as reported to HCAI). In 2021, all reporting hospitals except Chinese Hospital and UCSF were at or above the state average ratio of charity care costs to net patient revenue. Figure 22: Charity Care Costs to Net Patient Revenue, 2020 FY 2020 Charity Care as Compared to Net Patient Revenue Hospital Net Patient Revenue Cost-to-Charge Ratio Charity Care Costs Ratio of CC Costs to Net Pt.

Net patient revenue includes the payments received for inpatient and outpatient care, including emergency services. 32 period, all reporting hospitals except Chinese Hospital and UCSF were at or above the state average. Over the past five years between 2017 and 2021, most reporting hospitals have seen increases in their charity care cost to net patient revenue ratios, which follows the statewide trend. Figure 24: Charity Care Costs to Net Patient Revenue Ratios, by Hospital, 2017-2021 33 SECTION V: CHARITY CARE MOVING FORWARD Moving forward, there are a number of state and federal policy changes that may influence charity care programs and their use. San Francisco's charity care ordinance has enabled the collection of a long history of charity care data since 2001. The continued collection of this data, along with new demographic data on who is being served by these programs, will help to provide insight on the impacts of these ongoing and significant changes. The following subsections provide additional details on some recent and upcoming policy changes that could impact charity care programs. Medi-Cal Changes - The state of California's ongoing effort to expand Medi-Cal coverage is underway and will impact charity care programs in the years to come. In May 2022, the state began allowing undocumented residents over the age of 50 with low-incomes to enroll in Medi-Cal. This expansion resulted in 286,000 undocumented older adult Californians receiving full-scope Medi-Cal.31 Additionally, the expansion of Medi-Cal to all Californians with low incomes between 36 and 49, regardless of immigration status, will take effect by January 2024. This could impact close to 700,000 Californians.32 Medi-Cal expansions are expected to decrease overall HSF enrollment and reduce demand for charity care services. Further, another relevant initiative is California Advancing and Improving Medi-Cal (CalAIM), the state's multiyear plan to transform Medi-Cal to make the program more equitable, coordinated, and person-centered. Many of CalAIM's reforms also focus on improving care to specific populations with the most complex needs, including, but not limited to, people with significant behavioral health needs, people experiencing homelessness, and people transitioning from jail or prison back to the community.33 By identifying and managing comprehensive needs through a whole-system and whole-person care approach and addressing upstream social determinants of health, CalAIM may lead to decreased costs associated with vulnerable populations by reducing use of acute and high cost services such as emergency and hospital services. These reductions may reduce the need for charity care in the future as these same populations are more likely to receive charity care. COVID Policy Changes and the Public Health Emergency (PHE) - Federal and state policies during the pandemic helped to mitigate the potential negative impacts of the pandemic on healthcare coverage. In 2021, the American Rescue Plan Act, for example, enhanced ACA premium tax credits by decreasing the maximum percentage of income that enrollees were expected to pay for monthly premiums. The legislation also offered premium tax credits to households with incomes greater than 400% of the federal poverty level (FPL) in cases where premium cost exceeded 8.5% of household income, as well as provided premium and cost-sharing subsidies to households receiving unemployment insurance, making them eligible for free coverage.34 These subsidies contributed to substantially increased enrollment in Covered California.35 31 Office of Gavin Newsom (October 2022), Medi-Cal Expansion Provided 286,000 Undocumented Californians with Comprehensive Healthcare, https://www.gov.ca.gov/2022/10/19/medi-cal-expansion-provided-286000-undocumented-californians-with-comprehensive-health-care/ 32 CHCF, The Big Health Care Wins in California's State Budget, https://www.chcf.org/blog/big-health-care-wins-state-budget/ 33 CHCF, Cal AIM Explained, https://www.chcf.org/publication/calaim-explained-five-year-plan-transform-medi-cal/#calaims-goals 34 CHCF, Health Insurance and Health Care Affordability Perceptions Among Individuals Insurance Market Enrollees in California in 2021, https://www.chcf.org/publication/health-insurance-affordability-perceptions-individual-insurance-market-enrollees-ca-2021/ 35 Kadiyala et al., The Treat to Coverage and Affordability Gains in Covered California if Congress Fails to Renew Subsidy Enhancements, https://laborcenter.berkeley.edu/the-threat-to-coverage-and-affordability-gains-in-covered-california/#_edn5 34 Congress extended these expanded subsidies through 2025 through the Inflation Reduction Act. The federal government also provided 100% premium subsidies for COBRA coverage from April through September 2021, allowing people who lost their jobs during the public health emergency to keep their work-based health insurance.36 During the COVID public health emergency (PHE), states received increased Medicaid funding from the federal government if they postponed Medicaid dis-enrollments during the PHE. This \"continuous coverage\" requirement allowed millions of Californians to stay on Medi-Cal.37 However, the federal government recently announced that normal processes to redetermine eligibility for Medi-Cal enrollees will restart in April 2023. DHCS anticipates that the sheer volume of redeterminations, compounded by the beneficiary loss of contact, and other normal churn of individuals moving to the State marketplace (Covered California), would potentially lead to an estimated total of 2-3 million Medi-Cal dis-enrollments.38 The increase in disenrollment has the potential to lead to an increase in charity care patients due to increase in the number of uninsured or underinsured. Under DHCS' Continuous Coverage Unwinding Operational Plan, efforts to mitigate these changes include ensuring eligible individuals are smoothly transitioned to Covered California, and re-enrolling eligible individuals into Medi-Cal.39 Assembly Bill (AB) 532 and AB 1020 - Health Care Debt and Fair Billing Practices Two new state laws, AB 532 and AB 1020, went into effect in 2022 and will likely impact charity care at reporting hospitals in future years. Under AB 532, hospitals are now: Required to include in the written notice provided to patients on a hospital's discount payment and charity care policies the internet address of the Health Consumer Alliance (consumer assistance entity) and information regarding Covered California and Medi-Cal presumptive eligibility Required to automatically provide a person without health coverage with an application for financial assistance or charity care AB 1020 makes several significant updates to eligibility criteria and patient notices requirements. Specifically, the bill: Changes the eligibility threshold for charity care/discounted care from 350% of FPL to 400% of FPL. Currently all reporting hospitals charity care policies meet these criteria. Redefines high medical costs: Adds annual out-of-pocket costs at the hospital that exceed the lesser of 10% of the patient's current family income or family income in the prior 12 months to the definition of high medical costs. Adds new notice requirements: Requires hospitals to prominently display a notice of their policy for financially qualified and self-pay patients on their website with a link to the policy itself. The hospital must also send a patient a notice with specified information, including an application for the hospital's charity care and financial assistance, before assigning a bill to collections. Some reporting hospitals shared that the notification requirements provided by these bills would improve access to charity care for patients and potentially increase charity care patients in 2023. 36 CHCF, Coverage During a Crisis, https://www.chcf.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/CoverageDuringCrisisInsuredRateHistoric-HighPandemic.pdf 37 CHCF, Medi-Cal and the Ending of the Federal Continuous Coverage Requirement, https://www.chcf.org/collection/medi-cal-end-public-health-emergency/ 38 DHCS, Medi-Cal COVID-19 Public Health Emergency and Continuous Coverage Operational Unwinding Plan, https://www.dhcs.ca.gov/Documents/PHE-UOP/Medi-Cal-COVID-19-PHE-Unwinding-Plan.pdf 39 Supra Note 30 35 SECTION VI: APPENDICIES Appendix A: Charity Care Background History of charity care and community benefit requirements In 1956, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) codified the first federal tax exemption requirements for non- profit hospitals. At that time, it was determined that a hospital may qualify as a tax-exempt charitable organization if, among other things, it \"operated to the extent of its financial ability for those unable to pay for the services rendered and not exclusively for those who are able and expected to pay.\"40 This qualification measurement is known as the \"financial ability\" standard. After this ruling, the IRS began to assess hospitals seeking tax-exempt status on the basis of hospitals' charity care and reduced-cost medical services provisions and is the federal agency responsible for setting and enforcing these tax exemption requirements. With the introduction of the Medicaid and Medicare programs, it was thought that these health insurance programs would decrease the demand for charity care, thus presenting a challenge to non-profit hospitals trying to meet the financial ability standard. To meet this challenge, the IRS added \"community benefit\" to the list of requirements for non-profit hospitals seeking tax-exempt status in 1969, thereby expanding its requirements to include the promotion of health.41 At the state level, California passed SB 697 in 1994 requiring not-for-profit private hospitals to annually adopt and update a community benefit plan and submit to the Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development (OSHPD) beginning April 1, 1996. \"Community benefit\" refers to a hospital's activities that are intended to address community needs and priorities primarily through disease prevention and improvement of health status, and includes charity care.42 Since then, the most recent and significant changes to these federal requirements have come through the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA). When the ACA was passed in 2010, the legislation included a number of additional requirements for non-profit hospitals related to charity care and community benefits to be regulated and enforced by the IRS. The reporting on these requirements is done through Schedule H (Form 990), designed to supplement financial data collected from all tax-exempt organizations. Given the considerable growth in both the number of uninsured and the costs of medical care overtime, state and local governments took a keen interest in the charitable medical services and community benefit work done by non-profit hospitals before the federal government explored these issues in relation to national health reform. This was especially true in the City and County of San Francisco (CCSF), when it passed the Charity Care Ordinance in 2001. At that time, San Francisco was on the cutting edge of these efforts by creating a local mechanism for increasing hospitals' transparency and accountability with respect to the provision of charity care. Close to two decades later, and combined with ACA regulations to achieve the same goals, there is increasing overlap in the community benefit and charity care requirements across 40 Martha H. Somerville, Community Benefit in Context: Origins and Evolution, The Hilltop Institute, June 2012, p. 2. http://www.hilltopinstitute.org/publications/CommunityBenefitInContextOriginsAndEvolution-ACA9007-June2012.pdf 41 Ibid, p. 3. 42 Health and Safety Code Sections 127340-127365 https://oshpd.ca.gov/HID/CommunityBenefit/SB697CommBenefits.pdf 36 the levels of government. The following section explores the intersection of these local, state and federal requirements. Community benefit and charity care requirements for non-profit hospitals: local, state, federal Key requirements at the local, state, and federal levels for California hospitals can be broken down into two main groups: Community Benefit requirements and Charity Care Services requirements. The following tables outline the requirements and intersections of each.

At the federal level more specifically and after passage of the Affordable Care Act, there were notable adjustments to federal charity care reporting requirements for hospitals seeking non-profit status related to the maintenance of financial assistance policies, billing, charges and patient collection limitations, etc. The main goals of the changes to non-profit reporting was to increase accountability by non-profit institutions, relieve the effects of poverty, and improve access to care for needy patients. 37 Charity care and the Affordable Care Act (ACA) 1. The Impact of the ACA on the uninsured In California, the uninsured rate is estimated to have dropped by approximately 50 percent post-ACA implementation, and in San Francisco, an estimated 280,000 San Franciscans gained ACA-initiated health insurance. However, an estimated two million individuals remain uninsured throughout the State, approximately 30,000 or more of whom reside in San Francisco. These individuals, who will likely continue to rely on charity care, remain uninsured for a variety of reasons: Affordability concerns, even in consideration of ACA-initiated subsidies Inability to engage in the health insurance marketplace because of access or eligibility; Personal circumstances that make it difficult to maintain coverage, such as homelessness and documentation status Lack of awareness about eligibility for new insurance options, etc. 2. Charity care for the uninsured through Healthy San Francisco HSF is a locally-created and funded program that provides comprehensive, affordable health care to uninsured adults in San Francisco and has been included within the charity care report since 2009. HSF caters to the uninsured via a medical home-based model, pairing each member with a primary care provider at the time of enrollment and thereby improving access to preventive and coordinated care. It is an important contributor to San Francisco's hospital-based charity care landscape because, like traditional charity care, HSF is not insurance. HSF offers services to uninsured individuals who have less ability to pay. But, unlike traditional hospital-based charity care, HSF provides an organized system of care with a defined set of benefits that go beyond hospital services and, in some cases, requires insurance-like cost sharing (e.g. through sliding-scale quarterly participation and point-of-service fees). Almost all San Francisco hospitals included in this report provide services through HSF, with the majority of HSF enrollees receiving their medical home care at a DPH clinic (55 percent) or San Francisco Community Clinic Consortium (36 percent) with ZSFG as the affiliated hospital. The remaining 9 percent of HSF patients are connected with other medical homes. The table below notes these medical home and hospital affiliations. Some hospitals are directly affiliated with HSF medical homes, while ZSFG, Kaiser and St. Mary's also serve as an HSF primary care site themselves. This means that HSF data for the latter hospitals would include primary care along with the other outpatient services reported, while the other hospitals would include outpatient specialty care only. So, wherever comparisons are made between HSF and traditional charity care patient groups in this report, it is important to note the different types of service lines provided within each group and by the various hospitals. Figure 26 Healthy San Francisco medical homes and hospitals HSF Medical Home Affiliated Hospital DPH Clinics ZSFG Tenderloin Health Services ZSFG and Saint Francis San Francisco Community Clinic Consortium ZSFG Kaiser Kaiser Foundation Hospital, San Francisco Northeast Medical Services (NEMS) ZSFG Sister Mary Philippa St. Mary's 38 HSF is available to uninsured individuals who live in households with incomes up to 500 percent of the federal poverty level (FPL), irrespective of the person's employment, immigration status, or pre-existing medical condition(s). HSF began enrolling uninsured, eligible individuals in 2007. At the start of ACA open enrollment in October 2013, there were approximately 52,000 HSF enrollees, and this number had declined by approximately 69 percent to 15,862 in 2021.43 This decrease is due, in large part, to the transition of eligible HSF enrollees to ACA-initiated Medi-Cal expansion and Covered California health insurance coverage. Due continued barriers faced by some populations to access health insurance even in the ACA health reform landscape, most notably the undocumented, there is a clear and continued need for the HSF program in San Francisco. 43 SFDPH data 39 Appendix B: The San Francisco Charity Care Ordinance and Annual Report In 2001, the San Francisco Board of Supervisors passed the Charity Care Ordinance (Ordinance 163-01), authorizing the Department of Public Health (DPH) to require hospitals to report on charity care policies, the amount of charity care provided, and provide patient notification of charity care policies. The first of its kind in the Nation, the City and County of San Francisco (CCSF) took a unique approach by passing a local reporting law that would help to improve communication, cooperation, and understanding related to local hospitals' provision of free and reduced-cost care to low-income San Franciscans. The Ordinance states that: \"Charity care is vital to community health, and private hospitals, non-profits in particular, have an obligation to provide community benefits in the public interest in exchange for favorable tax treatment by the government.\"44 Reporting Timeframes for Hospitals For the charity care annual report, it is important to note that some hospitals report on a fiscal year (July to June) and others use a calendar year. More specifically, CPMC, St. Luke's/Mission Bernal, Chinese Hospital and Kaiser follow a calendar year (i.e., January 1 through December 31), while the remaining hospitals use a FY starting on July 1 of each year and ending on June 30 of the next. Therefore, the analysis in this annual report covers both, depending on the hospital- spanning July 2019 to December 2021. In response to a Health Commission request during 2014 reporting, hospitals were asked if they would be able to adjust their reporting to align to a single reporting period. However, hospitals reported that they were unable to adjust their reporting timeframes. AB 774 and SB 1276 Effective January 1, 2015, SB 1276 was enacted in response to the notion that though many individuals may become newly eligible for coverage on the State's Covered California health insurance marketplace, some of the plans offered may also introduce high out-of-pocket costs for consumers. To address this concern, SB 1276 revises AB 774 to alter the definition of an individual with \"high medical costs\" to include even those who do receive a discounted rate from a hospital as a result of 3rd party coverage.45 Insured patients with high medical costs, exceeding 10 percent of the family income and under 350 percent of FPL are eligible for charity care and partial charity care. The law also further defined a negotiated payment plan as one that considers a patient's family income and essential living expenses in the payment negotiation process - payment plan must be less than 10 percent of a patient's family income (per month after deductions). Finally, the law also requires that a hospital obtain information as to whether a particular patient may be eligible for insurance on the California Health Benefit Exchange and provide information to the patient regarding possible eligibility for the Exchange or another state or county health coverage program. All San Francisco hospitals have revised and submitted their policies to OSHPD to incorporate SB 1276 requirements. As a result of SB 1276, it is possible that a greater number of San Franciscans may be eligible for charity care or partial charity care, since it is now available to insured individuals and families with high 44 CCSF Health Code, Article 3 (Hospitals), Section 129. Charity Care Policy Reporting & Notice Requirement. 45 Ibid. 40 medical costs. Some hospitals in San Francisco reported that they already had programs and efforts in place to help insured patients with high medical costs prior to SB 1276. Hospital Charity Care Policies State policy requires non-profit hospitals to provide free or discounted care to uninsured patients with family incomes below 350% FPL or insured patients with high medical costs and family income below 350% FPL. For 2021, 350% of FPL was equal to $3,757 per month for a single person, and $7,29 for a household of four.46 All non-profit San Francisco hospitals comply with California state requirements, with all reporting hospitals providing charity care to patients at or below 400% of FPL, except ZSFG, which provides charity care to patients at or below 500% of FPL. The figure below illustrates San Francisco's non-profit hospitals policies related to charity care. 47 Figure 27: Charity Care Policies across SF Hospitals, 2021 CPMC Free Chinese Hospital Free or discounted (case by case) Saint Francis/St. Mary's Free Discounted Kaiser-SF Free UCSF Free ZSFG* Free or discounted (case by at any FPL level may qualify for the Discount payment program, whereas Charity Care requires patients be within 500% FPL and with assets not exceeding $10, 500. Hospitals report to DPH all charity care provided within the parameters shown in Figure 27, whether services are discounted or free. The discounts offered through charity care are treated as \"sliding scale\" payments by the hospitals, as they are dependent on the patients' income and are usually only a very small fraction of the usual charges for the care provided. All of San Francisco's reporting hospitals follow similar eligibility procedures for their charity care programs. All patients must go through an application process and provide proof of income. One of the few significant differences among the hospitals' charity care policies is the life-span of an application. The following hospitals allow for one year of eligibility for a patient whose application is approved: CPMC, Kaiser, Dignity (St. Francis and St. Mary's), and ZSFG. The remaining hospitals have a shorter time span: UCSF (6 months) and Chinese Hospital (90 days). When the eligibility period expires, the patient may re-apply. Charity Care Posting and Notification Requirements Both San Francisco's Charity Care Ordinance and the ACA require that hospitals communicate clearly to patients regarding their financial assistance programs, especially with regard to free and discounted charity care. According to the Ordinance, this must be done in the following ways: 46 APSE, 2021 Percentage Poverty Tool, Poverty Guidelines 47 Note that hospitals have different names for Charity Care, such as \"discount policy,\" \"financial assistance policy,\" medical policy,\" or \"bridge assistance policy.\" Hospital policies are anticipated to change under the implementation of AB 1020. 41 1. Verbal notification during the admissions process whenever practicable; and 2. Written notices in the prominent languages of the patient populations served by the hospital (at least English, Spanish, and Chinese). These notices must be posted in a variety of specified locations, including admissions waiting rooms, emergency department, and outpatient areas. Every other year, DPH staff visits each hospital to conduct a review of the facilities' compliance with the above posting and notification requirements. DPH staff visited all reporting hospitals between March - April 2023 and all hospitals met both verbal notification and physical signage requirements42 Appendix C: Reporting Hospitals Sutter Health: California Pacific Medical Center (CPMC) - Van Ness, Davies, Mission Bernal, Pacific, and California Campuses California Pacific Medical Center (CPMC) is an affiliate of Sutter Health, a not-for-profit healthcare system. CPMC was created in 1991 by the merger of Children's Hospital and Pacific Presbyterian Medical Center. In 1996, CPMC became a Sutter Health affiliate. In 1998, the Ralph K. Davies Medical Center merged with CPMC. Nine years later, in 2007, St. Luke's Hospital became a campus of CPMC. Today, CPMC consists of three acute care campuses and one ancillary campus: The Van Ness Campus (Van Ness & Geary) is a high-level regional hospital offering advanced medical technology, which opened in March 2019. It is the center for acute care, including oncology, orthopedics, ophthalmology, cardiology, and liver, kidney, and heart transplant services. Emergency care includes a dedicated pediatric emergency department. The Davies Campus (Castro District) provides advanced surgery and robotic-assisted surgery for orthopedic problems and joint replacements, as well as a 24-hour emergency room. It houses key centers for neurosciences, memory care, microsurgery, and acute rehabilitation, and has been recognized by the Joint Commission as a Primary Stroke Center. The Mission Bernal Campus (Mission District), formerly known as the St. Luke's Campus, is a vital community hospital serving underinsured residents in the South of Market districts. A new state-of-the-art hospital opened at this location in 2018, offering comprehensive medical services that include cardiovascular care, breast health, labor and delivery, orthopedics, general surgery, and emergency care. The specialized Acute Care for the Elderly (ACE) Unit is dedicated to the care of older patients.

It also houses CPMC's Center for Women's Health Care integrating the Breast Health Center, Women's Health Resource Center, and Pelvic Health Program. CPMC's three acute care campus locations have a total of 585 licensed beds (465 at Van Ness and Davies, 120 at Mission Bernal). CPMC also maintains partnerships with nonprofit healthcare providers such as Lions Eye Foundation, Operation Access, and North East Medical Services to give uninsured patients access to necessary services through charity care. CPMC also provides access to health services for Medi-Cal recipients through its Medi-Cal Managed Care partnerships, serving as the hospital provider for Medi-Cal beneficiaries who select North East Medical Services, Hill Physicians, or Brown & Toland as their medical group through San Francisco Health Plan. Since 2014, CPMC has expanded these partnerships to accommodate patients newly insured through the Affordable Care Act, assuming responsibility for thousands of new Medi-Cal Managed Care beneficiaries. CPMC is now the in-network hospital provider for one in three San Francisco Health Plan members.

It is a general acute care hospital with 451 budgeted beds and 645 licensed beds. ZSFG is owned by the City and County of San Francisco and is a component of the DPH. ZSFG reports charity care data on a voluntary basis for the purposes of this report. ZSFG attracts patients from well beyond its physical location for two main reasons. First, because of its unique position as the county's public hospital, specializing in care for the uninsured and others who have difficulty accessing adequate health care services. In addition, ZSFG operates the only Level I Trauma Center for San Francisco and northern San Mateo County. Individuals who are seriously injured in San Francisco and in parts of San Mateo County are brought to ZSFG's emergency room for care. ZSFG has maintained a teaching and research partnership with the UCSF Medical School for more than 130 years, and provides inpatient, outpatient, emergency, skilled nursing, diagnostic, mental health, and rehabilitation services for adults and children.

This section presents an analysis of this data.52 All reporting hospitals, except Kaiser San Francisco, are able to provide the zip codes of patients who have received charity care services. This section presents the data by supervisorial district, along with an expanded view of out-of-county charity care patients, as traditional charity care programs are not limited to CCSF residents. Figure 28: Map of San Francisco Charity Care Patients by Supervisorial District, 2021 52 Zip code data for HSF patients is not required as part of charity care reporting, thus, this section focuses on traditional charity care patients only. 54 Figure 20: Traditional Charity Care Patients by Supervisorial District, 2020 and 2021 Supervisorial District 2020 2021 Recipients Percent of Total SF Recipients Recipients Percent of Total SF Recipients District 1 1,134 3.0% 1,561 3,098 8.0% above table shows the distribution of all reporting hospitals' traditional charity care recipients by Supervisorial district. As is evident, and has repeatedly been the case since 2013, the majority of the charity care patients in San Francisco reside in Districts 6 (SOMA), 9 (Mission, Bernal Heights), 10 (SE Neighborhoods, including Bayview-Hunters Point), and District 11 (Excelsior). District 1 (Northwest/ Richmond) and District 8 (Castro, Mission) represent the smallest shares (about 3-4 percent each). Between 2019-2021 there was very little change in the charity care patient distribution by district despite increases in the number of patients. The concentration of charity care patients in these districts reflect systemic inequities in our city. District profiles as of November 2020 reveal that District 6 also have the highest proportion of residents living below poverty, and more than double San Francisco's average; District 10 has 47% more residents living below poverty than SF overall and two times more residents who identify as Black/African American; Districts 9 and 11 have the highest and second highest proportion of uninsured residents.53 Residence of Charity Care Patients Traditional charity care programs do not limit eligibility to San Francisco residents and the zip code information provided allows for an analysis of the geographic locations that hospitals serve outside of San Francisco. Taken together, this data indicates that San Francisco's collective pool of traditional charity care patients are: Predominantly from San Francisco; Largely from three nearby Bay Area counties -- Alameda, Contra Costa, and San Mateo; A significant portion are people experiencing homelessness; A consistently small portion are out-of-state residents. 53 SFDPH Supervisorial District Health Profiles, November 2020, https://www.sfdph.org/dph/comupg/knowlcol/chip/districthealthprofiles.asp 55 Figure 30: Traditional Charity Care Patients Reported Residence, 2017-2021 Persons Experiencing Homelessness The proportion of traditional charity care patients that are Homeless/Unknown stayed relatively stable between 2017 and 2019, and then decreased slightly down to 9 percent in 2021. The decrease in persons experiencing homelessness from 2019 to 2021 (15 percent to 9 percent) is due to a change of reporting at ZSFG. Address fields for people experiencing homelessness were imputed as the facility's address. The \"Other\" and \"Unknown\" category consists of patients who did not have a valid address in the hospital's financial system, which would include persons experiencing homelessness, those with errors in their record, and some who provided inaccurate information. Unfortunately, the data for charity care utilization among persons experiencing homelessness more specifically cannot be captured in this report because some hospitals do not identify patients using a standard homeless code in their registration systems.54 Finally, only a very small proportion of charity care patients resided outside of California (two percent) in 2021 and this has been the case throughout the history of this report. Out-of-County/California Residents Greater Bay Area Place of Residence for Charity Care Patients, 2019-2021 Out-of-country patients may access charity care in San Francisco hospitals for many reasons, from patients taken to ZSFG's Emergency Department or patients who seek medical care at one of San Francisco's renowned medical institutions. This proportion of out-of-county traditional charity care patients (i.e., Bay Area and California residents) has increased over time, from about 15 percent in 2017 to about 20 percent in 2021. 54 For example, some hospitals enter null values to indicate whether a patient is homeless, others enter special codes (e.g. \"9999\"), some enter the zip code for their hospital location, and many do a combination of the three. 69%67%69%70%69%16%18%15%11%9%9%9%10%12%14%6%4%5%5%6%1%2%1%2%2% 0%20%40%60%80%100%120% 20172018201920202021San FranciscoHomeless/UnknownBay AreaCaliforniaOut of State 56 The figure below shows the percentage of traditional charity care patients with residential addresses in the seven greater Bay Area counties in 2017 through 2021. Alameda County consistently represents the greatest proportion of charity care patients in San Francisco hospitals. In 2021, Alameda, Contra Costa, and San Mateo counties represent the greatest proportion of charity care patients in San Francisco hospitals, with about 73 percent of total patients. Figure 31: Greater Bay Area Place of Residence for Charity Care Patients, 2017-2021 In terms of absolute numbers, between 2019 and 2021, the number of Alameda County residents who received charity care services in San Francisco increased from 1,527 to 2,438 individuals; San Mateo County residents increased from 1,356 to 2,077 individuals; and Contra Costa County residents increased from 762 to 1,412 individuals. Similar to previous years, the analysis of 2021 data shows that residents in the eight greater Bay Area counties received charity care, by and large, from UCSF, ZSFG, and CPMC. In 2021, of the 8,119 reporting zip codes in the eight greater Bay Area counties, 1,160 (14 percent) received care at CPMC; 2,642 (33 percent) received care at ZSFG; and 3,618 (45 percent) at UCSF. These hospitals are also responsible for the largest number of charity care patients served overall in 2021. Of the 69,508 charity care patients, traditional and HSF, in 2021, 4,402 (6 percent) received care at CPMC (Van Ness & Mission Bernal); 9,763 (15 percent) received care at UCSF; and 44,853 Traditional Charity Care Patient Demographic Data Payor Status Between 2019 and 2021, the proportion of patients of uninsured decreased from 32 percent to 21 percent, while the proportion of those with \"Other\" types of healthcare coverage, or those with commercial insurance and workers compensation, grew from 12 percent to 26 percent. Beginning in 2021, UCSF changed to \"presumptive\" charity care, which led to more patients with \"Other\" payor services meeting the criteria for charity care. Figure 32: Traditional Charity Care Patients by Payor Source, 2019-2021 * \"Other\" payor type includes those with commercial insurance and workers compensation. \"Uninsured\" indicates the number of patients who self-pay their medical expenses. **This graph does not include Kaiser because they only reported 2021 data. Inclusion of their 2021 data does not significantly change the overall distribution of payor source. Refer to Appendix G for Charity Care Patients by Payor Source by Hospital, 2019-2021 There are significant differences in the distribution of payor types between hospitals. In 2021, uninsured patients represented the largest payor source for charity care patients at two out of the seven reporting hospitals. Conversely, at ZSFG, Medi-Cal and Medicare make up the largest payor sources (69 percent) for patients while the proportion of patients who were uninsured is much less significant comparatively, making up 13 percent of patients. For Kaiser, the \"Other\" portion accounts for those with other payor sources such as commercial accounts that need Medical Financial Assistance to cover costs. Because Kaiser Permanente is an integrated health system, this number may seem higher than other hospitals. Race/Ethnicity Between 2018-2021, the racial/ethnic makeup of traditional charity care patients remained relatively stable. In 2021, Hispanic/Latinx and White comprised the largest portion of patients with known racial/ethnic identities, representing 26 and 25 percent of the patient population, respectively. Most hospitals did not report Hispanic/Latinx patient data, and therefore are likely underrepresented in the dataset. Comparing the traditional charity care population to the overall race/ethnicity makeup of San Francisco, in 2021, traditional charity care patients were more likely to be Black/African American, Hispanic/Latinx, and less likely to be White.55 55 U.S. Census, Overall SF 2017-2021 Figure 35: Traditional Charity Care Patients by Race/Ethnicity by Hospital, 2021** **This graph excludes Kaiser because Kaiser data. 0%0%0%0%1%1%7%29%5%6%12%16%16%9%12%5%10%17%0%0%4%1%4%1%2%0%15%1%1%1%45%7%18%49%20%5%2%47%3%0%6%0%28%8%25%16%45%19%0%0%18%20%0%40% 0%10%20%30%40%50%60%70%80%90%100% CPMCChineseSaint FrancisSt. Mary'sUCSFZSFGAI/ANAsianBlack/African AmericanDeclineNH/PIOtherUnknownWhiteHispanic/Latinx 60 When examining the racial/ethnic composition by patients by hospital, the distributions are varied. St. Francis, St. Mary's, and ZSFG were the only hospitals that reported race/ethnic data for Hispanic/Latinx patients. For ZSFG, Hispanic/Latinx represented 40 percent of patients. Age Between 2018-2021, the age distribution of traditional charity care patients remained relatively stable. Compared to the overall age distribution of the City population,56 a larger proportion of charity care patients are older, and a smaller proportion are younger. In 2021, individuals aged 55 years and older composed 37 percent of total traditional charity care patients, compared to 29 percent of residents in this age group. On the other end of the spectrum, only 7 percent of patients were under the age of 19, while citywide, 16 percent of residents fall into that age group.

Based on the data, in 2021, a larger proportion of St. Mary's charity care patients are older, with 57 percent of patients aged 55 and older. In addition, 40 percent of ZSFG patients and 38 percent of Chinese Hospital patients are aged 55 and older. While hospitals have a small proportion of patients under age 19, UCSF has the greatest proportion of patients under age 19 years, at 14 percent. Gender/Sex Data on gender was limited, as most hospitals were not able to provide data capturing self-reported gender status beyond the binary of male and female.57 57 U.S Census, SF Population, S101 Age & Sex, 2021 ACS 1-Year Estimate https://data.census.gov/table?q=san+Francisco+age 4%3%1%1%14%6%9%8%9%7%7%9%21%17%23%10%17%16%22%21%23%10%17%16%18%13%15%15%14%13%15%21%12%25%15%15%10%17%16%32%16%25%0%10%20%30%40%50%60%70%80%90%100% CPMCChineseSaintFrancisSt. Mary'sUCSFZSFG0-1819-2526-3435-4445-5455-6465+ Care Patients by Gender/Sex, 2017-2021** **This graph does not include Kaiser because they only reported 2021 data.

St. Francis and CPMC have a significantly higher percentage of patients who are male compared to other hospitals, with 69 and 56 percent of patients identifying as male, Services The figures below show HSF and traditional charity care patients across all reporting hospitals by service type (emergency, inpatient, or outpatient services). The majority of patients across all service types are traditional charity care patients. The number of charity care patients receiving emergency services increased between 2019 and 2020 by 14 percent. Between 2020 and 2021, the number of charity care patients receiving emergency services decreased by 11 percent (21,361 patients in 2019 and 21,584 patients in 2021).
