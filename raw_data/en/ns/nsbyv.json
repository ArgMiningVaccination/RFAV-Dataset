Depending on the disease, the consequences can range from merely inconvenient to downright fatal. In an autoimmune disease, the immune system mistakenly identifies harmless tissues in the body as dangerous, then proceeds to attack it with brute force. Depending on the disease, the consequences can range from merely inconvenient to downright fatal. The frustrating thing about autoimmune diseases is that nobody really understands what causes it. Doctors know what's happening, but they don't necessarily know why. Unfortunately, prescribing treatment for a disease without a clear idea of its origins is like taking a shot in the dark and hoping for the best. Stress is often cited as a trigger for autoimmune diseases, but that doesn't give patients much relief. How can they manage stress effectively when they're worried about being sick? It's an endless cycle that blurs the line between the cause and the effect. Patients want a more concrete understanding of their conditions, and consequently, a more reliable treatment. Conventional medicine still has a long way to go before it can fully comprehend the ins and outs of autoimmune diseases. But what it can't handle, alternative medicine possibly can. Naturopathy, a form of alternative medicine, deals with the idea that the body can heal itself without the use of medication. Instead, healthy lifestyles are encouraged and natural remedies, such as herbal medicine, [liquid multivitamins](http://www.wellesse.com/our-supplements/multivitamin-liquid/), acupuncture, or homeopathy, are administered. Medical practitioners of naturopathy are called naturopaths. They work under the notion that nature has an incredible power to heal, and that things people often take for granted (like enough rest and sleep) actually play a big role in maintaining good health. While regular doctors work to treat symptoms, naturopaths go straight to the root of the problem. This is exactly why it is considered a haven for sufferers of autoimmune diseases. Conventional medicine is centred on making a diagnosis and administering treatment based on the diagnosis. But how can a regular doctors find a suitable treatment for stress? They can't perform a surgery to remove stress. They can't melt away stress with lasers. They can't prescribe an antibiotic that attacks and kills stress. Naturopaths, on the other hand, acknowledge stress as an all-encompassing cause of many physical illnesses, particularly autoimmune diseases. They are not interested in treating the symptoms of just one or two diseases, but rather in improving your overall health to prevent you from falling ill again. But presently, this practice is still considered a last resort by many. Although the idea behind this branch of alternative medicine is strong, it's not that easy to find the right person you can rely on, at least not when compared to looking for a trusted physician. So if you want to try naturopathy, practice due diligence. Don't take advertising claims at face value. Do your own research to learn more about practicing specialists. This is the only way you can find a practitioner you can trust. But in the end, \"prevention is better than cure\". So stay healthy by incorporating a healthy diet and exercise into your lifestyle. *Image courtesy: \u00a9 Thinkstock photos/ Getty Images "}
