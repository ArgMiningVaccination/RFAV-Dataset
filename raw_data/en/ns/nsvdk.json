In light of this, there has been a concerted effort to identify small molecules that can effectively combat RSV. This article focuses on the mechanism of action of compound K142, which was identified as a primary screening leader in the earlier stages of the project. The research conducted demonstrates that K142 significantly reduces the intensity of virus penetration into the cells, as well as the formation of syncytia from infected cells. These findings show that the compound's interaction with the surface proteins of RSV is a key factor in its antiviral activity. Furthermore, pharmacological modeling supports that K142 effectively interacts with the F-protein. However, in vivo studies have shown only weak antiviral activity against RSV infection, with a slight decrease in viral load observed in lung tissues. As a result, there is a need to enhance the bioavailability or antiviral properties of this compound. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that further modifications of the compound under study could potentially increase its antiviral activity.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2023-08-18", "cleaned_text": "Identification and Study of the Action Mechanism of Small Compound That Inhibits Replication of Respiratory Syncytial Virus [https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms241612933](https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms241612933) [Advanced Study Introduction [1](#B1-ijms-24-12933)]. [2](#B2-ijms-24-12933)]. Certain groups, such as children with chronic illnesses and individuals with weakened immune systems (including the elderly and those who have recently undergone organ transplantation), are particularly vulnerable to severe complications. [3](#B3-ijms-24-12933), [4](#B4-ijms-24-12933)]. To further combat this infection and treat RSV-related diseases, potential future strategies could include vaccinating newborns and children, as well as passive immunization with a vaccine or antibodies that have an extended half-life. It is of utmost importance to develop new strategies to effectively combat this widespread infection and alleviate the burden it places on individuals and communities. [5](#B5-ijms-24-12933)]. This study led to the identification of a new structural type of potent inhibitors of RSV replication. The leader compound 19c, now having a code name K142 ( [Figure 1](#ijms-24-12933-f001)) ((3-(((1S,5R)-6,6-dimethylbicyclo [3.1.1]hept-2-en-2-yl)methoxy)-7,8,9,10-tetrahydro-6H-benzo[c]chromen-6-one)), demonstrated good activity against both RSV A and B, with a selective index of more than 70 and an IC50 ranging from 4.9-5.1 M [ [5](#B5-ijms-24-12933)]. [6](#B6-ijms-24-12933)] revealed the antiviral activity of structural analogs of K142, which contained 4-aryl-substituted coumarin cores conjugated with monoterpene fragments. Although the most active compounds were found to be less potent than K142, they exhibited slightly better selectivity indexes [ [6](#B6-ijms-24-12933)]. Therefore, coumarin-monoterpene conjugates hold promise for the development of new anti-RSV agents. [5](#B5-ijms-24-12933)]. The current work aims to delve deeper into the mode of action of K142 and test its efficacy in an in vivo experiment. 2. Results 2.1. Interaction of RSV with the Host Cell at Various Stages of the Life Cycle in the Presence/Absence of K142 Using Confocal Microscopy [5](#B5-ijms-24-12933)]. To gather further data, we employed confocal microscopy to visualize the various stages of the viral life cycle in the presence of K142. [Figure 2](#ijms-24-12933-f002)and [Figure 3](#ijms-24-12933-f003). [Figure 2](#ijms-24-12933-f002), it is evident that cells in the control group are covered with viral particles, which completely envelop the cell membrane and also form fainter filamentous structures extending into the cell. Conversely, in the presence of the compound K142, fragmented viral antigen on the membrane can be observed, without continuous coverage of the cell membrane. Furthermore, the overall amount of antigen is significantly less than in the control group. [Figure 3](#ijms-24-12933-f003)). [Figure 4](#ijms-24-12933-f004)). [5](#B5-ijms-24-12933)] regarding the compound's mechanism of action, which suggest its effect on the viral proteins F and G is responsible for these processes. 2.2. Evaluation of the Antiviral Efficacy of K142 In Vivo [7](#B7-ijms-24-12933)], we opted for oral administration at a dosage of 50 mg/kg. Additionally, we explored the drug's activity through an alternative be observed that the viral load in the lungs of mice treated with the reference drug ribavirin showed a statistically significant decrease compared to the control group. This indicates the suitability of the model employed and its relevance for evaluating the antiviral activity of experimental drugs against RSV. [Figure 7](#ijms-24-12933-f007)) revealed the presence of bronchogenic inflammatory foci in all groups under study. These foci were primarily located around the bronchi, with limited extension into the underlying lung tissue. Additionally, the examination identified erythrocytes present in the alveolar lumens in several samples. 2.3. Simulation Results [5](#B5-ijms-24-12933)] within the binding site. The model system was designed in such a way that the transmembrane domain of the protein was immersed in the membrane ( [Figure 8](#ijms-24-12933-f008)). It is believed that in molecular dynamics simulations involving such proteins, the presence of a membrane is crucial for accurately positioning the secondary protein structure throughout the simulation. In this case, we are referring to the heptad repeats of the F-protein, which consists of -helices adjacent to the viral membrane (see [Figure 8](#ijms-24-12933-f008)A). [Figure 8](#ijms-24-12933-f008)B). Throughout the entire simulation, the ligand remained within a symmetrical binding site and did not diffuse into the solvent. However, the geometric parameters of the ligand underwent notable changes, particularly when compared to the initial position ( [Figure 8](#ijms-24-12933-f008)A,B). Of particular interest is the tetrahydro-benzochromen-one fragment, which is highlighted by a sphere in [Figure 8](#ijms-24-12933-f008)and was initially located at the starting position corresponding to the beginning of the simulation. [Figure 8](#ijms-24-12933-f008)). These interactions are maintained for 80% of the simulation time. [8](#B8-ijms-24-12933)]. 3. Discussion [9](#B9-ijms-24-12933)], albeit in a prophylactic treatment regimen. Its derivative, Rilematovir (JNJ-53718678), is currently undergoing clinical trials [ [10](#B10-ijms-24-12933)]. In vitro experiments have shown high activity of Rilematovir, with an EC50 value of 9.3 M [ [11](#B11-ijms-24-12933)]. Comparatively, the efficacy of K142 in vitro conditions shows similar indications. However, it is challenging to compare activity in animal models due to the variation in animal species used.

Preliminary Assessment of Virus Titer in HEp-2 Cell Culture 4.1.6. Cell-ELISA [13](#B13-ijms-24-12933)] targeting the RSV F protein was applied to the culture. The culture was then incubated for 2 h with continuous stirring at room temperature. After the incubation period, the cells were rinsed again with a buffer solution, and secondary anti-mouse antibodies were introduced. Another round of incubation for 2 h with continuous stirring followed this step. The remaining antibodies were washed off, and a substrate-chromogenic mixture containing tetramethylbenzidine was applied. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 5 min before halting it with 0.1 M sulfuric acid. To quantify the optical density of the resulting solution, measurements were taken at a wavelength of 450 nm. Wells with an absorbance value two or more times higher than that of the control cell wells were considered to be contaminated. Finally, the virus titer was determined using the Reed and Muench method. 4.2. Registration of the Viral Life Cycle in the Presence of K142 by Confocal Microscopy - (1) - The first group served as a negative control, with cells not incubated with the virus. - (2) - The second group served as a positive control, with cells incubated with the virus for the designated study time. - (3) - The third group was an experimental group, where cells were pretreated with K142 for 1 h and then incubated with the virus for the same duration as the control group. [13](#B13-ijms-24-12933)], washed three times with PBS, and incubated with a solution of rabbit secondary anti-mouse antibodies (dilution of 1:500) conjugated with a fluorescent label (Alexa 488). This step was followed by three washes with PBS and incubation with a Hoechst 33,342 solution (dilution of 1:500) to stain DNA (cell nuclei). 4.3. Materials and Methods for In Vivo Experiments 4.3.1.
