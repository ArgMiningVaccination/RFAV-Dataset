Even today this 5000 year old wisdom of health and wellness is being practiced widely in India. The recent awareness on a holistic approach to health as a far more superior system of medicine as opposed to the reductionist methods followed by modern science, helped Ayurveda spread far and wide to other parts of the world. Layers of human existence As opposed to modern medicine which treats our body as a mechanical system with all its body parts as separate entities, Ayurveda views this human body as a conscious, self regulated, holistic entity with an innate intelligence to correct any disease condition that may arise due to several factors. The 3 planes of human existence according to Ayurveda are as below: Physical plane, Mental plane, Spiritual plane The consciousness directs the vital force and the vital force (a funtion of vata, pitta, kapha - the bio-energitics) directs the physical body. When all three layers/ planes conduct their functions normally, a perfect balance is established. This natural state where our existence is in perfect alignment, the physical body works in perfect alignment with the vital force is what we term in ayurveda as 'health'. A healthy body indicates balanced vital force that's evenly distributed in different vital organs and tissues of our body. Disease manifestation In a diseased state, vital force becomes weak. It will be conditioned by the matter/ physical body and becomes immovable and erratic in its flow. This leads to the conditioning of consciousness which gets 'trapped' or 'imprisoned' in the matter by vital force. The free-flow of life is arrested and this condition according to Ayurveda is what is termed as 'disease', where the ease is lost or the balance is disturbed. When the vital force experiences any disturbance because of various external factors, the entire bio-energy of our existence gets disturbed. This imbalance in vital force is what causes disease at physical level. The disease first occurs at the spiritual level (which goes unnoticed at initial stages) and later it percolates into other lower levels of mind and body (mental and physical). "}
