Wh at is in this toolkit and how is it organized ? This is a toolk it for decision -makers and implementers of vaccin e clinics. Our goal was to create a \"vaccination clinic in a box\" that could be replicated in, and tailored to, many types of settings. Since December 2020, when the first COVID -19 vaccines were available, there have been four main ways to deliver vaccin es. (1) Mass vaccination sites, either drive -through or walk -in, were established in large parking lots, convention centers, and sports arenas, with the goal of vaccinating thousands of people every day. (2) Community -based vaccine events serve a smaller n umber of people and are held in a health center/clinic building or another site within a distinct neighborhood (eg, church, school) ; people may or may not need an appointment in advance. (3) Community pharmacies, mostly large chains, are administering COVI D-19 vaccines by appointment. (4) Healthcare providers are administering COVID -19 vaccines as part of routine clinical care during patient visits (similar to other vaccines such as flu, TDAP, MMR). We developed this toolkit to share our team's experience creating a stand -alone vaccine clinic in a primary care rural health center (OHSU Family Health Center in Scappoose, Oregon). In our case, these were evening and weekend vaccine -specific clinics, serving both patients of the clinic and community members. The clinic operated between January - June 2021. During this time, eligibility and community uptake of vaccines changed dramatically. Nevertheless, our workflows, staffing models, documentation, and outreach were very consistent from the start to the end. This toolkit includes prompts for questions you may need to ask, examples of many types of documents that you may need (and information about where to find more documentation), and lessons -learned from our experience. If your community -based site is in a l ocation other than a clinic, many aspects of this guide will still be helpful to you, but we acknowledge that there are unique considerations for creating vaccine clinics in spaces not usually designated for providing clinical care. Our vaccine clinic sta rted in January 2021, during a time when vaccine doses were scarce and clinics were expected to adhere to strict guidelines about the stages for eligibility for vaccination. This is reflected in the information about how to manage scheduling, opening vials , and managing waitlists. In Fall 2021, this is no longer an issue, and we have added a section on vaccine wastage guidelines. Our toolkit on workflows for administering COVID -19 vaccines as part of routine outpatient primary care is available at https://bridgetoinnovation.org/our -initiatives/covid -response/ This guide is intended to be a \"living document,\" and we hope to update it as needed . If you implement a community -base d vaccine clinic, whether it is in your clinic buil ding or in a community building, we would love to learn from and integrate your experience s into this guide. Please send us an email to share your experiences. Deb Cohen cohendj@ohsu.edu Sonja Likuma huwa -Ackman likumahu@ohsu.edu 5 | Chapter 2. Knowledg e and evidence related to COVID vaccines In this section, we share links to detailed information about the vaccines for COVID -19 that have been approved for use . The vaccine information and use authorizations are rapidly changing, so we provide links to get the most up -to-date information. Through these links, you can get information about these vaccines and evidence to -date of t heir efficacy, plus additional information and communication resources. 2.1.

Federal, state and county i nformation and resources 3.1. How to register as a vaccination site One of the most important changes to vaccines in the Fall of 2021 is that there may not be mass vaccination sites for COVID -19 and clinics will need to get more involved in vaccinating people. Check with your state leaders to learn how to get identified as a vaccination site and get access to vaccines. For information about signing up to be a COVID -19 vaccine provider, see your state's COVID -19 Provider Registration website In Oregon, you can put your clinic on the Get Vaccinated Oregon Site here: https://admin.getvaccinated.oregon.gov/#/provider Oregon is utilizing a hub and spoke distribution model for vaccine distribution. The Oregon Health Authority (OHA) has identified thirteen Vaccine Redistribution Hubs f or COVID -19 vaccine across the state, to widen vaccine access and prevent waste. All provide the Pfizer vaccine, with most of the Hubs providing other COVID -19 vaccines as well. More information about ordering vaccines in Oregon is in Section 7.1. 3.2. Supplemental funding for v accine storage and handling equipment The OHA/Oregon Immunization Program is announcing the availability of funding for vaccine storage and handling equipment. This funding is available to all existing Vaccines for Children (VFC), Vaccine A ccess Project (VAP), and CARES providers of influenza vaccines . The funding is also available for facilities that are offering COVID -19 vaccine, and this includes for clinicians that are not yet enrolled. To become eligible as an enrolled facility , complete the ALERT IIS part of the enrollment (you do not have to have completed the entire enrollment process). Allowable purchases will be reimbursed up to $1,000 per vaccination facility. Allowable purchases include: Vaccine storage units (i.e., refr igerators and freezers approved for vaccine storage). Note: NO dorm -style combined refrigerator/freezer units allowed under any circumstances. Temperature monitoring equipment Vaccine transport coolers that are purpose built for maintaining appropriate r efrigerator or freezer temperatures for vaccines Supplies required as part of a clinic's immunization activities (e.g., first aid kit, EpiPen, etc.) https://app.sma rtsheet.com/b/publish?EQBCT=1e38f1448f5f424fb0d478adeb7a144b 3.3. COVID -19 vaccination administration supplemental funding (Oregon specific) This funding is to pay for uncovered costs related to COVID -19 vaccination incurred by Patient Centered Primary Care Home (PCPCH), Certified Community Behavioral Health Centers (CCBHC) and OHA -recognized Public Access Clinics. See more information here . 8 | This program contains two tracks: Comprehensive Services: Pays up to $75 per COVID -19 vaccination administered by PCPCH clinics and CCBHCs providing comprehensive services such as costs involved in conducting out reach, education, scheduling, follow up, tracking, reporting, management and ordering of vaccines. Vaccination services provided on or after January 1, 2021 will be funded through the Comprehensive Services program even if registration occurs at a later da te. Direct Cost Reimbursement: Provides direct cost reimbursement for clinics not participating in the Comprehensive Services Track, and covers expenses related to vaccination activities, supplies and equipment. PCPCH, CCBHC and Public Access Clinics may choose to participate in the Direct Cost Reimbursement Track if they do not choose the Comprehensive Services Track. Expenses incurred on or after January 1, 2021 are eligible for reimbursement through the Direct Cost Reimbursement Track. The only clinics that may not qualify will be those who have received significant financial support or grants from other programs (specifically LPHAs). Oregon Health Authority launched the program in June 2021 and has 40 clinics participating, and have distributed $1M in supplemental funding. Information about OHAs clinic funding program, including an application and FAQs can be found on the Information for Providers page of the OHA website: 9 | 3.4.

Staffing and roles This chapter describes our experience s building the team to staff the vaccine clinic . This includ es engaging staff and volunteers, how we led and communicated w ith the team, how we organized shifts, oriented teams to their roles, an d kept staff safe. We also describe the roles and functions that are necessary for a vaccine clinic. We've described these functions so that in your vaccine site you can distribute functions among the staff and volunteers that you have. In many cases, th ese roles and functions can be combined such that one person could play multiple roles. 4.1. Engaging staff and volunteers People working at a vaccination site will likely come from three sources: clinic al staff, non -clinical staff such as administrator s and managers, and external volunteers . Clinic staff were paid for shifts that they worked at the vaccine clinics, including overtime pay if applicable. Our initial vaccine clinics were held on weekends when the clinic would normally have been open but w ith limited staff assigned to work . The assigned staff for those clinic sessions were converted to become the core team for the vaccine clinic. This team was augmented with additional clinic staff and volunteers. Because we were creating appointments and d ocumenting vaccinations within our electronic health record (EHR) , it was critical to have experienced staff members. This also limited the number of volunteers that we could have who were unfamiliar with the EHR. Many of our clinical staff belong to a uni on, such as ONA and AFSCME. Our institution (OHSU) held discussions with the unions to determine guidelines around pay and extra hours. We sent an email to clinic staff on Thursday morning listing the shifts that were available that weekend . The short turn around was due to the county's weekly vaccine allotment process, which currently happens mid -week. Non -clinical staff in our department , such as administrators, managers and researchers, were enthusiastic about volunteering. For those w ithout EHR knowledg e and access, the re were only a few roles (eg, assisted with greeting, screening, and directing traffic as needed ). Volunteers who committed to working several shifts were given the opportunity to receive EHR training and access. Clinic staff, such as fron t-desk and registration, were generous with their time and helped orient our volunteers to easy EHR -based tasks, such as how to look up appointments and check people in. With enhanced training and \"learning on the job,\" we were quickly able to expand our g roup who are now able to do tasks that require basic EHR access. Of note,t he Vaccinators and Lead Monitor need to be medical personnel who are licensed in the state . Some states are also allowing retired medical personnel whose license s have expired to d o vaccination. The p eople drawing up vaccines need to be trained to prepare vaccines (eg, nurses, pharmacists ). The remainder of the roles don't need to be medical staff. Our vaccine clinics have been conducted with a blend of clinic personnel and volunte ers from other departments and locations . This has been an overwhelming success, as it has created a camaraderie among people who would not otherwise work together. Although your clinic may not be affiliated with an academic health center, there may be fam ily and community members who want to volunteer and support your clinic. We encourage you to consider this, as vaccinating your community will take months, staff may struggle to sustain the level of participation required, and inviting volunteers into the process can create joy and 11 | connection in a time when that is needed. If you do not have enough staff and a cadres of people connected with your organization who can volunteer, many communities have two organizations that have highly trained and organized v olunteers: American Red Cross and Community Emergency Response Teams (CERT). These organizations can quickly mobilize trained and reliable volunteers who can help with roles such as putting out signs, directing traffic, and greeting and screening people wh en they arrive at the vaccination site. If your site is not using an EHR for scheduling and documentation, these volunteers could staff other roles, too. Communication with volunteers We had originally planned to have a web -based form for volunteers to u se to indicate interest and schedule themselves for shifts. However, it was just as effective to communicate via email. We sent out an initial email querying for interest and built a list of names and email address es using Smartsheet (though Excel would wo rk as well). We specifically asked people if they could commit to volunteering at least three shifts per month, to try to build a core team of recurring volunteers. Then we communicated at least once a week with everyone on the list, providing training upd ates and opportunities for shifts. Shifts We set up shifts that are 4 to 5 hours long. We heard feedback from many people that this was the maximum they would be able to commit to regularly. We timed shifts so that there was a 30 -minute overlap between shifts (e.g., first shift 8 -12:30, second shift 12 -4:30) . This allowed the first shift personnel to provide orientati on and on -the-fly training for the pe ople taking over their role s. Here is an example of how we managed volunteers using an Excel spreadshe et for morning and afternoon shifts with a goal of 400 -500 vaccines administered each shift . We have made this E xcel file available to you, too (note link in section 4.4) . 12 | Orientation and leadership Orientation: We created short descriptions for m ajor roles and shared these with staff by email ahead of their shift. We also laminated shift descriptions and had them on -site for people to briefly review at the start of their shift. Much of the orientation was done \"on the fly\" by the person who was wo rking the shift just prior or by others who had worked previous shifts. For some of the roles (e .g., EHR registration), there was a short orientation video or other training required. Leadership: We learned that it was very helpful to have a point person for the start of each shift, for each main function. Team members could check in with this person a nd be oriented to their role. We also provided an email orientation, including what to wear, where to park, and what to bring. This email is available to you and referenced again in Chapter 6. It was very helpful to have leaders clearly identified whose responsibility it was to step in and make tough decisions. For example, depending on the number of anticipated extra doses, there may be some flexibility to schedule an on -the-fly appointment for a caregiver or spouse. Individual volunteers shouldn't make those judgements; rather, there should be a person identified who team members can call on in sticky situations. Keeping volunteers safe We provided perso nal protective equipment ( PPE) for everyone . Medical -grade disposable procedure masks were available as well as hand sanitizer and bleach wipes . Disposable f ace shields , gowns, and gloves were also available to all, if desired. 4.2. Functions and roles for the vaccinat ion clinic In this section we describe, as completely as possible, all the functions that we needed to carry out a vaccine clinic. Before we started, we knew that rules governing who could vaccinate and who could have access to and the ab ility to use our clinic 's EHR would define what functions a person could play. We did take steps to train a subset of our non -clinic volunteers in the registration and scheduling processes, and this has been successful. Our institution created an online tr aining program that these volunteers completed, and this was complemented by onsite training by clinic staff ,several hours of shadowing , and then doing the task with support from an experienced user. In Chapter 8, you can read about a real -world example fr om White Bird Clinic in Eugene, Oregon, which decided not to use an EHR for scheduling and documenting. We divided this section about specific team member roles by the following functions: No computer/EHR knowledge/access required The ability to use the E HR to do R egistration/Scheduling The ability to use the EHR to create and manage an Encounter The clinical certification to vaccinate ( e.g., MA, LPN, RN, MD, DO, APP , student working under license of a certified individual ) We describe functions and the tasks that belong to that function. Depending on the size of the vaccine site and the number of doses given, one role (person) could do multiple functions. For example, at one site the MA acts as scribe, documenting the vaccine, monitoring for screening ti me, cleaning the room, and escorting 13 | people to the exam room. At another site, MAs might be vaccinating, and there may be non -clinical volunteers escorting people, serving as scribes, and/or cleaning rooms. See next pages for role descriptions. 4.3 For m ore information about staffing and roles Vaccine clinic time and budget worksheet (Harvard Primary Care Center) Vaccine clinic readiness checklist (state of California) 4.4.

Organizing the vaccination clinic This chapter describe s what you need to get started on planning and organizing your vaccine clinic. We provide a one -page printable checklist for key supplies, resources, and documents. We also describe our experience obtaining vaccine doses from our county, including key cont acts, delivery, storage, and reporting. One of the most complex aspects of vacci ne clinics is to consider all the factors involved in planning for the number of vaccine doses that can be administered in an hour. We describe some of the methods we've used to estimate this, based on physical space, the number of people who are scheduled, and staffing capacity. We also describe decision -making around monitoring the remaining vaccine doses. These are some of the most critical decisions that you will face as yo u are operating your vaccine clinic. 19 | 5.1.

Obtaining vaccines When contemplating the implementation of a vaccine clinic, you need to know if you will have consist ent access to vacc ines. In Oregon, vaccine receipt from the federal government is managed by the state. The state then di stributes most of the vaccine doses to each individual county, which is authorized to manage distribution to organizations and people within their region . Vaccine allocation to our Scappoose clinic team was determined directly by the county health department. Our clinic was approached by the county health department to assist with vaccine administration due to limited availab ility of space and teams at o ther sites . After we created a prototype model for a vaccine clinic, we started with a pilot clinic weekend, to work out issues in real time, while not getting overwhelmed by volume. For the pilot clinic, we administered 100 vaccines/day, with vaccinators averaging about 10 vaccines given/vaccinator/hour. We were able to dramatically upscale from that rate on subsequent clinic days. Every week our clinic leadership communicates with the county health department about our potential capacity for vaccine adm inistration, at which point the county makes a request to the state. We are notified by early/mid week of the final allocation for our county (o ften, we are not given the full amount requested) . Within the next 48 hours, we recruit staff needed to administ er that weeks' vaccine allocat ion, and then give the final schedule of available appointment slots to the county health department, which then direct s groups to sign up via a third party , HIPAA-compliant software system. Vaccines currently are shipped to OHSU 's central pharmacy and transported to our community -based clinic , but w e anticipate they w ill eventually be shipped directly to our clinic. The vaccine doses arrive as a kit, including syringes/needles, CDC vaccine cards , and vials of vaccine. Bandaid s/gauze/alcohol/gloves are provided by the clinic. We were approached about the possibility of adding Pfizer vaccines because ther e are fewer places who can store them . Our state had a certain number of sub -zero fr eezers available per county (our county w as allocated 1), and the county asked us to take this freezer in order to store Pfizer vaccines . (We also had to commit to d elivering at least 1000 vaccines per week .) Currently, we receive and store Moderna v accine s on- site in our normal vaccine freezer/f ridge. 5.3. Estimating how to \"right -size\" your vaccine clinic to match your vaccine doses On a national scale, delivering as many doses as quickly as possible is the goal. However, every local vaccination site must be able to expand and contract depen ding on the number of doses available or how many people are scheduled. This is because vaccine doses available from week to week are highly variable and inconsistent. There are several factors that determine the number of people that can be vaccinated per hour at a site. This chapter describes considerations and lessons -learned on how to balance vaccine doses with the ability to administer the vaccines. 21 | 5.4. Estimating throughput One important consideration for your vaccine clinic will be determining the time it takes to vaccinate someone , how you define a vaccination team, how many vaccinations a team can do, and how many teams will be needed to deliver the scheduled vaccinations on Vaccination D ay. There are several factors that go into making this decision. Where will people be monitored, and can 15 - and 30 -minute monitoring be done as a group? If people can be moved and monitored safely in a large conference room or waiting , this is important because it frees up the vaccinators and vaccination s pace to continue with the next person . Are you going to have vaccinators moving from room to room, or will you have the vaccination team remain stationary and have people move ? We had limited large spaces available, so we had vaccinators moving from room t o room. Who will be on a vaccination team? This may take some trial and error. We paire d one vaccinator with two people (scribes) who were tasked with r ooming people , opening, prepar ing and completing the vaccination encounter in our EHR and scheduling 2nd dose appointments . This team could vaccinate 100 -150 people in a 4 -hour clinic session if they had enough exam rooms available for them to efficiently move from room to room . When estimating the number of vaccin es you can administer, t he following may be helpful: o Start small. Set a small goal for your first vaccine clinic, and then built on your success. Our first clinic aimed to vaccinate 200 people. That success gave us the confidence to increase our target for the next weekend. We have been able to steadily increase the number of vaccines we deliver at each clinic session. o Have a \"modular\" structure that can be increased or decreased in size due to changes that will inevitably occur each week as vac cination supplies ebb and flow. o Decide if you want to continue to provide routine and urgent clinical care during the same time frame. This will limit availability of staff, rooms, and parking but may be the best option for your community and your clinic's sustainability. 5.5. How vaccine storage impacts decision making There are two ways to approach vaccine storage. These have a dramatic impact on decision -making in all aspects of the vaccine clinic. Option 1 : If you are able to store unused vaccine doses for another day, you can calculate the approx imate number of doses that can be administered in your physical space and with your staff , but you will have some \"wiggle room\" to flex your supply of vaccine up or down as you go . Each vaccine has different storage requirements, which are summarized in Se ction 5.6. Option 2 : If you have XX number of doses that you must administer within XX hours, and any leftover doses will be wasted, then you must aggressively utilize a wait ing list and keep people flowing through the site until you've given your last do se (i.e., at a site with no refrigeration) . 22 | Option 1: One major consideration for monitoring vaccine dos es is whether or not you have the capability to store vaccin es for multiple days/ weeks. If you have the ability to store vaccines for multiple days /weeks , then you can pace your clinic sessions . As described above, set a target for vaccinations in collaboration with county leaders or other community -based partners who may be handl ing requests for doses, prioritization of people, and/or online scheduli ng. By Thursday of each week, county leaders would tell our team how many people signed up to get a vaccine. This gave us an initial estimate of the number of doses we need ed to have available per day , and we have the ability to store unopened vials, so w e opened vials and filled syringes individually throughout the day to match demand being careful not to have too much supply at any given time. (Note: You can get at least 10 doses from vials of Moderna , so if you open the vial for one person, you'll need 9 people ready to receive the remaining doses that day .) Option 2: If you need to use all vaccine doses in a specific timeframe, you will need to set your vaccine clinic hours of operation and schedule adequate staff to work the site in order to be sure t o administer all doses within this timeframe. You need to aggressively manage a waiting list. This is an ongoing list of people who did not have an appointment, but approach your team about getting vaccinated. Or , you may have a list that your county or ot her partners have generated ahead of time from eligible people who were interested but did not get a scheduled appointment. We recommend beginning to call the people on your wait list early in the session, especially if you have a high number of no shows. We describe our experience with this in Section 6.11. You may decide to overschedule your clinic, to account for no shows (although this could lead to disappointment for people scheduled late in the day if everyone shows up) . As part of this option, you could theoretically create a stand -by line for people who show up without an appointment, so you have people on site and ready to go . In summary: If you fall short one day/session and can store unused vials, you can try to add additional people to your sch edule the next day/session to utilize the leftover vials of vaccine. If you cannot store unused vials, you need a plan for quickly adding same day appointments to your schedule (more on this topic below in 6.11). In our clinic we used Option 1 described a bove. We prepare d vaccine doses as we went, rather than preparing them all in advance. We did this because it allowed us to closely align the number of vaccines prepared with number of people who actually showed up for the clinic session. We had a no sho w rate of 1 -10% most days at the height of the vaccine clinic (February - April 2021) . By the time the stand -alone vaccine clinic closed at the end of June 2021, the no show rate was closer to 25%. Proceeding in this way, it is very important to estimate the total number of vaccinations you anticipate administering in 1 ho ur, and then purposefuly draw up few er vaccinations for that hour . That way if there is a bottleneck at check -in, or multiple no -shows, you do not have expiring syringes that you are scra mbling to administer before they expire. The nurse/pharmacist drawing up the vaccines likely will not know the actual rate at which you are vaccinating, so this can get tricky. We had an experience one hour where there were several expiring vac cines and no waiting patients. We scrambled and got them into other pods, but this is a situation to try and avoid. 23 | Regardless of which way you plan to run your vaccine clinic, keep in mind that each vial contains multiple doses which must be completely administer ed within short time frames. Vaccines CANNOT BE RE -FROZEN once they have been thawed . 5.6.

Developing a vaccine clinic workflow and utilization of space An important part of preparing for a vaccination event at your clinic is to plan the workflow. This can take a little bit of time and iteration. Planning a workflow is one of those tasks that is best accomplished by a small multi disciplinary group, as having team membe rs with different types of knowledge and different perspectives can help. Once you develop what you think might be a good workflow, do a test run. Walk through all steps of the flow and identify where things might go wrong. Recruit a few patients to help, too! Also, be prepared to debrief after each vaccine clinic and discuss what worked and what did not regarding the timing and flow of the people for the vaccine clinic. You will continue to iterate and refine the workflow as you go. As mentioned above, start with a small number, this \"mini -version\" of your clinic will allow you to identify bottlenecks and refine your workflow. We also used observers to help us identify workflow improvements. There are going to b e bottlenecks in the workflow on vaccine day. While greeting and screening people for COVID -19 symptoms and possible adverse reactions to the vaccine can be done quickly, checking people in for their appointment, particularly if you are using a complicated EHR and/or collect ing billing information , can be a bit more time consuming. Check -in is one place where there can be a bottleneck. A second common bottleneck is after people are checked -in as they wait to be roomed for their vaccination (or wait to be ca lled over to a vaccination station) . 6.1. First steps and considerations As you begin to plan your vaccine clinic, take stock of all of your clinic 's physical assets: Some examples of outside assets include: Parking lot - will there be sufficient park ing? If not, where is good overflow parking? What about people with mobility issues? Is there a paved walkway around the building? Is any of this paved walkway covered? This could be a good place to set -up a check -in desk and the shape of the building can be used to form help form lines for people waiting to check -in and then for vaccinations. Consider where the team will be most visible as people approach . Sandwich board signs/ signs on the walls to help with way finding and one direction flow. (Try to reduce or eliminate people having to cross back over the flow.) Consider where check in is located - make sure that the no ise level will not make it hard for staff to hear people. Some examples of inside assets include: How many examination rooms do you have? Do you have a room, perhaps a small conference room, where vaccines can be filled? Do you have a room where multiple people can be monitored after they have been vaccinated? Do you have places where signs could be placed to help with wayfinding? It is very easy to get lost in a clinic where everything looks the same. 25 | Do you have tools that foster communication, such as flags on doors, white boards outside rooms, walkie -talkies? If setting up in a community building not fitted for clinical care (e .g., school, church, community center), what spaces do you have and how do you want to design your space and allocate certain spaces for certain tasks? If you create this type of clinic - please share information with us so we can add a chapter about it in our next version ! Next is a list of items to consider as you begin to plan for the flow of this clinic vaccine event. Parking Where will people park? Where will volunteers and clinical staff park? Activities that are best conducted outside, if possible COVID -19 symptom screening Screening for possible adverse reactions to past vaccines, history of anaphylaxis, and identifying those who need 30 -minute monitoring (vs. the standard 15 -minute monitoring) Check -in Waiting for a vaccinator For outside activit ies, here are some questions that might prompt your team's workflow development : How will people visually know where to go after they've parked? Will there be tables set up for check -in? If so, where will you place these? How will people be directed to th e end of the first line after they park? How do you want that first line to move? Consider the advantages of having that line (or a line) follow the contour of the building, particularly if you don't have other markers. After the person is greeted, how do you want the line to move from having been greeted to check -in? You will see in our clinic, people were asked to line up for check -in and greeters moved up and down the line to screen people. How do you want the line to move from check -in to being brough t in for a vaccine? How will you keep lines separate? How will you keep people appropriated spaced (physically -distanced by 6 feet)? Do you want or have markings 6 -feet apart? Chalk could work for this. We just estimated it. How will you support people who are unable to stand in line to wait? How will you support people unable to walk short distances (wheelchairs, walkers, etc)? For activities inside your clinic , here are some questions that might prompt your team's workflow development: What rooms wil l you use to vaccinate people ? How will the team know when a room is open, but not yet clean? When it's clean and available? When a room is occupied? Where will you monitor people ? 26 | o Will this be inside an exam room with the door open , inside a larger space within the clinic (e.g., waiting room) , or is it possible to do this outside under a structure (e.g ., a tent) or in personal cars? o If monitoring inside the building, how can you keep people moving so exam rooms for vaccinations open quickly? o How will yo u keep people physically distanced? o How will you identify and monitor people w ho need 15 - and 30 -minute monitoring? How will people know when they can leave? 6.2. Sample workflow and floor plan In this section, we walk you through the flo or plan of ou r clinic and show you how we organized our clinic, as this might help your planning. We also walk you through the workflow at our clinic, and provide you with sample scripts that you can use to get your team started. Physical Layout and People Flow The figure below is the floor plan of our clinic . Our clinic is part of a medical /shopping center where there is ample parking. The building has a small overhang around the building, and a larger overhang at the f ront of the building. There are multiple doors where people can enter and exit the building. We set up two folding tables at the front of the building to be used for check -in. This is marked on the map as \"Registration.\" Three people were typically seated at this table to register people. See Secti on 6.7 for m ore details about how the check -in table was set up . After people parked, they could see the check in desk, as they approach ed the front of the building. A greeter was watching people as they approached the building, and directed them to the en d of the line. There was a check -in line. And, once this line formed, people generally knew to follow it and go to the end, with little assistance. 27 | The main limitation of this spot wa s the curb, as it was not wheel chair accessible. There was not a great alternative for us, but it is an important consideration . The people in line for Registration are marked with an X on the map. People lined up six feet apart for this line. Given the building's overhang, people could stay somewhat dry while they waited. We did not have spots marked on the sidewalk, and people needed to be reminded by the greeter(s) to maintain 6 -feet from others . If possible, mark the distance . People who cannot stand and ambulate: At each session, we had a number of people who could not physically stand for 20 -30 minutes waiting for a vaccine and/or who were in a wheelchair. In these instances, we either had someone in the line just after th is person \"mark their spot\" and let us know when it was their turn so the Greeter could locate the person and his/her caregiver. We also sometimes had a family member hold the person's spot. Or, if possible, we found a place inside the clinic where people could sit and wait for their turn. After Registration, people were initially directed to one of two doors, although the flow worked better when we used three doors; the lines were shorter and moved faster with three doors. This, however, required having an extra vaccination team working. Doors 1, 2 and 4 are marked on the map with the appropriate number. Lines formed at each of these doors as people waited (outside) to be roomed for a vaccine. Blue dots mark how we directed this line. Given the footprint of the clinic, we needed to be careful and guide people to keep these two lines separate. This was a particular concern at Doors 2 and 4, but when we added a third door and an extra vaccination team, there were fewer people waiting in line at this step in the process. Inside the clinic , we used the Platinum Pod Conference Room for the team filli ng the syringes. This room was staffed by at least one RN and was also where people who needed 30 -minute monitoring were located while they waited, as the people filling the syringes could also monitor these people. Having an RN fill vaccine syringes and monitor people in this space was useful. Think about places in your workflow and space where you can strategically place your team members who can do multiple tasks. We used the lobby to monitor some of the people who had a 15 - minute waiting period. We c ould safely distance about 12 people in this waiting room, which was generally all that was needed. If the waiting room was too full, people were asked to wait in their examination room, and monitors walked the halls to make sure people were doing okay. P eople were asked to set a personal timer for the time they needed to wait. Most had a smart phone that they could use for this task. We also used white boards outside each exam room to note the time a vaccine was given. 28 | The picture above shows people assig ned to each role and each location. We used approximately 25 examination rooms. The clinic has four pods. Each pod had a vaccination team (1 vaccinator/2 scribes) , the teams are described in Section 6.9 . Each team worked between 4-6 examination rooms, with one team overflowing into the lobby, if needed. This overf low rarely occurred. The Roomer /Scribe would invite and escort the next person in the \"already check -in\" line outside into the building (from either Doors 1, 2 or 4), bring the person into an ope n (and cleaned) examination room, log into the EHR to create an encounter, and schedule their second appointment (if applicable) . The Roomer /Scribe would then use a room flag system and/or walkie -talkie to communicate with the clinician that the person was ready for vaccination. The vaccinator did one additional screen of allergies prior to vaccinating and answered any additional questions. We used flags similar to how our usual clinic flows: red flag signaled scribe was in room with vaccine recipient , green flag signaled recipient was ready for vaccinator, blue flag signaled recipien t had been given vaccine and was waiting for 15 minute monitoring in exam room with the door open. Workflow The figure below shows our workflow . It is downloadable as a PDF here . In Chapter 5 we describe all of the functions needed to carry out a vaccine clinic. And, we describe how, in our clinic , we combined some of those func tions into roles, such as the Greeter/Screener role and the Roomer /Scribe role. The workflow below shows the sequence in which these functions or activities were carried out and by whom. This is a swim lane diagram. It is read from top to bottom an d from left to right. Working f rom the top, the first grey row, which is labeled number 1 is the first swim lane. We created a grey swim lane to show that these activities all occur before the day of the vaccine clinic. The top lane denotes all functions relat ed to the registration activity, which is complete when all people scheduled for the vaccine clinic have had an appointment scheduled in the clinic 's EHR. The ovals show each step in the process: The green ovals show steps carried out by the registrator . The first uncolored oval shows a step that is carried out by the person who is wishing to be vaccinated (i.e., schedule online). Note: Steps in the flow diagram for scheduling a second vaccine dose will not be needed for the J & J vaccine. This was noted in pink as part of Rooming & Scribing. 29 | As this swim lane shows, this Registrator receives a list of eligible people who scheduled an online vaccination appointmen t. The Registrator prints this list to have at the day of the vaccine clinic. And, they enter each person into the clinic 's schedule in the EHR. Each swim lane shows a different activity and the steps in the process and the order in which they occur, if read from left to right. In our clinic, those doing Rooming and Scribing worked in teams with those doing Vaccinating. The triangles show the steps in the process, and the colors of the triange show which role carries out the step (e.g., green is done ahea d by clinic staff; blue is the Greeter/Screener; pink is the Roomer/Scribe; purple the vaccinator, and so forth). 6.3. Scheduling vaccine recipients for first dose Before the day of the vaccine clinic, p eople were pre-scheduled via a HIPAA -compliant pla tform . For us, this was facilitated by Columbia County Public Health , which used the Acuity platform . Other HIPAA compliant scheduling platforms are Jot Form, BlockIt and SOLV . See Chapter 8 for examples of how these platforms were used. Since we were using our EHR to document vaccines, the r egistrato r attempt ed to pre -register each p erson via an expedited registration workflow . In order to register people in our EHR, the following information needed to be collected by the county's scheduling system: full name, date of birth, address, phone number, sex , preferred language. If this is possible, it will speed the check -in process on the day of the vaccine clinic. It is important to know the elements of information needed for registration , reporting , billing and for completing your state's immunization reg istry documentation. 6.4. Assisting with car flow/ traffic in the parking lot We found that people would arrive early to the vaccine clinic. We asked them to wait in their cars until the clinic opened. In addition, cars would be arriving and departing t he lot all day. We did not experience trouble with traffic, and drivers were largely able to negotiate the parking lot, park their car and join the line. If you have a tricky parking situation, it is advisable to have someone directing traffic and monitori ng parking (ensure they have vests and traffic wands). Given limited spaces in the lot, volunteers and staff were asked to park elsewhere. An email was sent to the vaccination team the day before the clinic with directions for where to park. For the examp le email that was sent to volunteers, click here . 6.5. Screening people for an appointment and appropriate priority group Our clinic is following the priorities that Oregon has set for vaccinating the population. This prioritization can be found by clicking here . Updates to the state's vaccine priorities can be found on COVID -19 Updates (egov.com) . 30 | We assumed that people the county had scheduled into an appointment slot met eligibility criteria ; we did not do a re -assessment at the check -in door to determine whether each p erson who arrived fit within the state's eligibility criteria. Managing the communication when a person must be turned away There will be people who you will have to turn away. We recommend listening to th ese people , and treating them kindly. Everyone wants to get vaccinated, and it's difficult to have to wait. Explain to the person that the state and county are identifying and inviting people to the vaccine clinic based on priorities. The clinic is not making these decisions. Give them a handout tha t describes your state's vaccination eligibility groups, if appropriate (example from Oregon is in Chapter 3). Provide them with a handout of who they can contact in their county. In Oregon, this information can be found here . Offer to take the person's phone number and put them on a wait list. We explained to people that sometimes, at the end of a clinic session, there are a few extra vaccines to be used. We contact ed people in the order that they were placed on this list to come into the clinic t o be vaccinated. The person may only get 15 -20 minutes notice, if this were to happen. Typically, people were happy to have this op portunity. Managing family and friends Friends and family that accompany the person with a scheduled appointment, but are not part of the priority group being vaccinated (and do not have an appointment) were not vaccinated at our clinic. We asked these people to wait in the car (or elsewhere), but not in line, if the person with the appointment was able to wait in line alone. If the person getting vaccinated needed assistance, we asked family and friends to identify one person to accompany the person. We had some instances where multiple people from the same family were getting vaccinated, and all had appointments. These people waited in line as a group. Each individual was checked -in. This family was then roomed as a group (in the same examination room) . The Roomer/Scribe created an encounter and second appointment for dose 2 for each individual, and the vaccinator vaccinated all people at the same time. In some instance, we allowed families to monitor in the examination room. Managing people who reques t a different vaccine It is being widely publicized that some people are requesting one of the vaccines over another. Our institution has begun publicizing which vaccine will be offered at a vaccination event, which allows people to make their own choice about whether to get vaccinated at that event, or a different event. We will continue to update this toolkit with more resources on this topic, including decision support tools as they become available. In the meantime, Boost Oregon offers resources for discussing vaccine hesitancy. The CDC offers strategies for healthcare providers to answer common questions about COVID -19 vaccines. 31 | 6.6. Screening people for COVID -19 symptoms The questions we asked to screen p eople for COVID -19 symptoms can be found here . We laminated these questions. P eople were screened for COVID -19 symptoms outside. The Greeter/Screener did this. After completing these questions . If a person screens positive on COVID sy mptom screen, they needed to reschedule. The Screener contacted the Vaccination Lead on duty for assistance. We did not have anyone at the event screen positive for COVID -19 symptoms. 6.7. Screening people for a dverse reactions to the vaccine /monitoring needs After screening for COVID -19 symptions, the Greeter/Screen then asked people about potential adverse reactions to the vaccine. The following visual document was created to identify people who should and should not proceed with a vaccine, and people who should wait for 15 or 30 minutes after vaccination. Although we had a laminated versi on of this available to the Greeters/Screeners, it was easier for these volunteers (who were often non -clinical volunteers) to have a few short questions to guide their screening process. The CDC prevaccination checklist is shown below and available t o download here . OHSU provided our clinical system with the following guidance: People should delay an immunization until a consult with an allergist has occurred if the person has had : Hypersensitivity reaction to the first dose of the COVID -19 vaccine; Known severe allergy to a COVID -19 vaccine ingredient; Their own concerns that they might have a severe reaction when they get the vaccine. Based on this gui dance, we identified four key questions for the Greeter/Screener to ask. 32 | CDC item #4 Have you ever had an allergic reactions to another vaccine other than COVID -19 vaccine? CDC item #5 Have you ever had a severe reaction to severe reaction to anything els e, or history of anaphylaxis needing an EpiPen? #9 Do you have a weakened immune system? #11 Are you pregnant o r breastfeeling? We asked this last question, not because these are contraindications, but because this allowed us to direct people to the medi cal lead if they had additional questions or wished to talk with a clinician. Greeters and Screeners held laminated cards that said \"30 minutes.\" They handed this card to anyone who reported a prior allergic reaction to a vaccine. They also handed a 30 min ute card to people who had concerns they wanted to discuss with a clinician and/or who reported a severe allergy that could be clinically relevant (e.g., antibiotics, peanuts) and required additional assessment/consideration. 6.8. Registration and check -in Your clinic will need to consider how it will register, check -in, and submit the vaccination information to the state. We used a vaccination module built into our EHR, which is Epic. This enabled us to use a streamlined registration and scheduling proc ess for people who were not patients of the clinic. At the check -in table, each staff member had a laptop, a printout of the people scheduled for the day (for reference in case the person's appointment could not be found in the EHR), sanitizing wipes for p ens, umbrella handles, and wheelchair handles, and to wipe laptops in between users. We also provided blankets and a small heater under the table. People made their appointments via the county. The county sent information to the clinic. For many people, minimal information was added to the EHR for the person and an appointment was created. On the day of the vaccine clinic, when people arrived, those at the Registration Desk found the person's name on the schedule and then followed steps to check -in the pe rson. When people were already in the system and their information was complete (which was accomplished through pre -scheduling done by the team in advance), check -in was rapid. When this information was not in the EHR, the person at Registration added the necessary information. This did slow down the Registration process. (As noted above, if this is happening frequently at registration, consider having another desk available to do this additional work so that you can keep your line moving.) If you choose t o use an EHR -based tool to track vaccine administration, it is important to outline the essential information needed (i.e., the least amount of information your clinic needs to collect from hundreds of people who are not already registered as your establis hed patients in the EHR). Streamlining this process as much as possible and doing work ahead of the vaccination day will make the registration process most efficient. 33 | 34 | 6.9. Monitoring p eople post -vaccine Post -vaccine monitoring is the biggest limiti ng factor in how a vaccine clinic will function. You must provide space for every person to safely sit for 15 minutes after being vaccinated , distanced from others. A small number will need 30 minute monitoring. Effective planning of monitoring space is es sential. Some ideas are: Bring 15 -minute people to the lobby. They can self -time the 15 minutes using their phone or watch. Move 30-minute people to a conference room . Have people return to their cars if the parking lot is large enough to accommodate this. People can write the time on their windshield or be handed a piece of paper for their dashboard. If you have ample exam rooms, have them sit in an exam room with the door open. Regardless of where you choose to monitor people, you will need a few team me mbers to keep an eye on people . You will need to have some supplies on hand for ( extremely rare ) vaccine reactions. In general, the critical piece is ben adryl and epinephrine. We alerted our local fire & rescue team about the clinic and to let them know th eir services may be needed for anaphylactic reaction ; in our case, the fire & rescue building is a few hundred feet away from the clinic building so they were not on -site. For other vaccine clinics it would be advisable to have EMTs on site in the parking lot to help to respond to emergencies. Anaphylactic reactions are EXTREMELY rare. In our experience the vast majority of reactions were vasovagal reactions from people with either needle phobias or anxiety around vaccine administration itself. For this rea son, it was important to have someone available that can offer this latter group juice/water/cracker s and have ability to take basic vitals, etc. We extended monitoring of anyone with vasovagal reactions to 30 min utes (minimum ) of monitoring with the requi rement that they must feel back to baseline before leaving the facility. 6.10 . Billing The COVID -19 vaccine was purchased by the U.S. government and is therefore available to every person at no cost. People receive the vaccine regardless of ability to p ay and regardless of their insurance status. Providers are able to bill insurance for the administration of the COVID -19 vaccine. CMS has several toolkits on this centralized resource page to assist with billing: https://www.cms.gov/COVIDvax In addition, we cover coding information in Chapter 8.11. Oregon and other states may have funding through FEMA to supplement insurance reimbursement. Please see Chapter 3 for more information about support for vaccination. Even if you are not currently billing or planning to bill, it is prudent to collect insurance information from people along with a clear message that they will not pay anything out of pocket for the vaccine. 6.11. Managing a wait list for end of day le ftover doses As described above, we kept a wait list of people who were interested in getting called if we have extra vaccines to use at the end of the clinic. You can find the list we created for this purpose here . Typically, the person at the Registration Desk kept this list. 35 | 6.12. Vaccine \"waste\" or unused doses In early 2021, vaccine supply was scarce and a lot of attention was given to maximizing every drop of vacc ine in a vial. Since May 2021, there has been a major shift in recommendations about waste: Vaccine v ials may be opened without e very dose being used. As access to COVID -19 vaccine increases, it is important for providers to not miss any opportunity to va ccinate every eligible person who presents at your primary care clinic for a COVID -19 vaccine. As there are opportunities to vaccinate more people, it may increase the likelihood of leaving unused doses in a vial. Your clinic may want to consider that desp ite following best practices to use every dose possible, that should not be at the expense of missing an opportunity to vaccinate every eligible person when they are ready to get vaccinated. https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid -19/downloads/wastage -operational -summary.pdf 6.13.

Boosters, additional doses, and \"mixing and matching\" 7.1.a. Booster doses The CDC recommends that some COVID -19 vaccine recipients get booster shots. P eople 65 years and older, 50-64 years with underlying medical conditions, or 18 years and older who live in long -term care settings should receive a booster shot. All p eople 18 years and older should receive a booster shot at least 2 months after receiving their Johnson & Johnson/Janssen COVID -19 vaccine. People may select any brand of COVID -19 vaccine for their booster dose, regardless of brand used for initial doses. Source: https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid -19/clinical -considerations/covid -19-vaccines -us.html -BioNTech or Moderna COVID -19 Vaccine Older adults age 65 years and older : People ages 65 years and older should get a booster shot. The risk of severe illness from COVID -19 increases with age and can also i ncrease for adults of any age with underlying medical conditions. Long -term care setting residents ages 18 years and older : Residents ages 18 years and older of long -term care settings should get a booster shot. Because residents in long -term care settings live closely together in group settings and are often older adults with underlying medical conditions, they are at increased risk of infection and sever e illness from COVID -19. People with underlying medical conditions ages 50 -64 years : People ages 50 -64 years with underlying medical conditions should get a booster shot. The risk of severe illness from COVID -19 increases with age and can also increase for adults of any age with underlying medical conditions . People with underlying medical conditions ages 18 -49 years . People ages 18 -49 years with underlying medical conditions may get a booster shot based on their individual risks and benefits. The risk of severe illness from COVID -19 can increase for adults of any age with underlying medical conditions . This recommendation may change in the future as more data become available. People who work or live in high -risk settings ages 18 -64 years . People ages 18 -64 years at increased ri sk for COVID -19 exposure and transmission because of occupational or institutional setting may get a booster shot based on their individual risks and benefits. Adults who work or reside in certain settings (e.g., health care, 37 | schools, correctional facilities, homeless shelters) may be at increased risk of being exposed to COVID -19, which could be spreading where they work or reside. That risk can va ry across settings and based on how much COVID -19 is spreading in a community. This recommendation may change in the future as more data become available. Examples of workers who may get COVID -19 booster shots: First responders (e.g., healthcare workers, f irefighters, police, congregate care staff) Education staff (e.g., teachers, support staff, daycare workers) Food and agriculture workers Manufacturing workers Corrections workers U.S. Postal Service workers Public transit workers Grocery store workers For people who received J&J/Janssen COVID -19 Vaccine All p eople ages 18 years and older who received a J&J/Janssen COVID -19 vaccine at least 2 months ago should get a booster shot. The J&J/Janssen COVID -19 vaccine has lower vaccine effectiveness over time compared to mRNA COVID -19 vaccines (Pfizer -BioNTech and Moderna). 7.1.b. Additional primary doses (a.k.a. third dose) People with moderately to severely compromised immune systems are especially vulnerable to COVID -19, and may not build the same level of im munity to 2 -dose vaccine series compared to people who are not immunocompromised. CDC recommends that moderately and severely immunocompromised persons aged 12 years (Pfizer - BioNTech recipients) or 18 years (Moderna recipients) receive an additional primary dose of the same mRNA COVID -19 vaccine at least 28 days after a second dose , as follows: Pfizer -BioNTech: 30 \u00b5g in a volume of 0.3 ml (same as the primary s eries dose and booster dose) for persons aged 12 years. Moderna: 100 \u00b5g in a volume of 0.5 ml (same as the primary series dose) for persons aged 18 years. This additional dose is intended to improve immunocompromised people's response to their initial va ccine series . Immunocompromised people include those who have: Been receiving active cancer treatment for tumors or cancers of the blood Received an organ transplant and are taking medicine to suppress the immune system Received a stem cell transplant with in the last 2 years or are taking medicine to suppress the immune system Moderate or severe primary immunodeficiency (such as DiGeorge syndrome, Wiskott -Aldrich syndrome) Advanced or untreated HIV infection 38 | Active treatment with high -dose corticosteroids o r other drugs that may suppress your immune response 7.1.c. \"Mixing and matching\" vaccine brands According to the CDC , the same brand of COVID -19 vaccine should be used for the first, second and third (for those who are immunocompromised) doses. Booster doses may be any brand of the COVID -19 vaccine. 7.2. Pediatric and adolescent vaccines 7.2.a. Is the COVID -19 vaccine recommended for children and adolescents? The American Academy of Pediatrics ( AAP) recommends COVID -19 vaccination for all children and adolescents 5 years of age and older who do not have contraindications using a COVID -19 vaccine authorized through an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) or Biologics License Application (BLA), recommended by CDC, and appropriate for their age and health status. Read the AAP statement . 7.2.b. Do children and adolescents need special consent or assent to receive the COVID -19 vaccine? This information comes from the American Academy of Pediatrics . State and/or local laws determine who is able to consent or assent for COVID -19 vaccines; the same as other vaccines. In most places and instances, a parent's consent is required for a child or adolescent to receive a vaccine. While this may not always require a signature, you may consider obtaining one for COVID -19 vaccines. Health care providers administering the vaccine should inform vaccine recipients of the following: (1) FDA has authorized emergency use of the vaccine (2) known and potential risks and benefits related to emergency use (3) that they have the option to accept or refuse the product and (4) be informed of any available alternatives to the product and their known r isks and benefits. Each recipient should receive a fact sheet that includes essential information about the vaccine. The fact sheets for health care professionals administering the vaccine as well as recipients were approved as part of the authorization an d are available from the FDA website: Fact Sheets for Health Care Providers EUA Fact Sheet for Recipients and Caregivers (12 years of age and older) EUA Fact Sheet for Recipients and Caregivers in Sp anish (12 years of age and older) EUA Fact Sheet for Recipients and Caregivers (5 -11 years of age) EUA Fact Sheet for Recipients and Caregivers in Spanish (5 -11 years of age) 7.2.c. Special considerations for vaccinating patients under age 12 Information from Pfizer for the 5 -11 years of age formul ation: Standing Orders for Administering Vaccine Preparation and Administration Storage and Handling Summary 39 | Administer catch -up vaccinations to patients who are behind . Most parts of the country have experienced decreased rates of routine childhood and adolescent immunizations during the pandemic. The time is now to call patients and families and encourage them to return and get caught up. As some patient s and families may be hesitant to return to the office, the AAP has reinvigorated its #CallYourPediatrician campaign, which includes resources that practices can use to amplify this message. Information on reminder/recall strategies is available here . Promote COVID -19 vaccine confidence . Misinformation about COVID -19 vaccine abounds. Vaccine hesitancy threatens the promise of herd immunity against COVID -19. Practices can utilize resources in the AAP Immunizations CampaignToolkit to promote vaccine confidence. In addition, practices can utilize the CDC's COVID -19 vaccine conf idence resources . Consider ways that patients and families in your practice like to receive information and use these mechanisms to debunk common myths and answer frequently asked questions. Know the COVID -19 vaccination sites in your community : If your practice chooses not to administer COVID -19 vaccine, you should identify and compile information about nearby COVID -19 vaccination sites to share with your patients and families. A good resource is https://www.vaccines.gov/search/ which allows you to search by product and zip code. Parents can also text their ZIP code to 438829 (GETVAX); or call 1 -800-232-0233. Encourage everyone to be vaccinated and ask families to notify you if your patient rece ives COVID -19 vaccine elsewhere. This will help ensure a comprehensive immunization record. 7.2.d.

Vaccine Equity 7.3.a . OHA vaccine advisory committee - a vision for equity across the state The Oregon Health Authority (OHA) convened a COVID -19 Vaccine Advisory Committee (VAC) to develop the state's sequencing for the COVID -19 vaccine. The 27 -member VAC held four meetings during the month of January 2021 and three information sessions to discuss topics related to vaccine delivery. According to the recommendation report, \" VAC members were selected from a group of nearly 700 peopl e for their professional background, lived experiences or expertise serving individuals that have been systemically impacted by COVID -19. The VAC was convened with the specific intent of centering equity in all vaccine sequencing decisions .\" The VAC ackno wledges structural racism and pressure from systems that are not ready to center this truth about the ways structural racism impacts the health of Black, Indigenous and People of Color (BIPOC) communities. VAC sequencing was in consideration and in review of the data and needs of BIPOC communities and refugee communities. Vaccine distribution must include working with trusted community partners including community -based organizations, faith leaders and trusted entities where people feel 40 | comfortable. OHA m ust track and use data along the way to capture information about medical mistrust and barriers. Local public health authorities are charged with engaging and working with vulnerable populations. This includes partnering with community - based organizations, federally qualified health centers and other local organizations to develop a community -informed, equity -informed vaccine distribution plan. 7.3.b . How one community is implementing this equity vision [This section was contributed by Columbia -Pacific CC O] In order to achieve a shared vision of vaccinating the most people within our communities, various sectors are co ming together collaboratively in three rural counties in Northwest Oregon: Columbia, Tillamook, and Clatsop. The box on the right describe s the Coordinated Care Organization model in Oregon. Over the last several years, CCO s have developed close partnerships with public health, community -based organizations, hospitals, and health system at -large, in service to improving the system of care. T hese partnerships have served as an important foundation for developing the systems to distribute COVID -19 vaccine. The CCO that serves Columbia, Tillamook and Clatsop counties is called Columbia Pacific CCO. As the CCO for this region, we recognize d that this work of vaccinating communities needed to be led by local public health and communit y-based organization. We were active partners to add value where needed . This has included convening partners, providing funding and other support, providing data, and developing an equity toolkit, as described below . Convening partners to identify barriers and develop solutions to reach underserved populations Columbia Pacific -CCO played a convening role, bringing together partners (community -based organizations, pub lic health, primary care and hospitals) across its three -county region to discuss and address system ic barriers related to accessing COVID -19 vaccine . The process of convening partners has been instrumental in helping cultivate shared, innovative, and integrated approaches to vaccinate the community. The Columbia Pacific -CCO role was to invite partners, provide the web meeting platform, take notes, identify next steps, and co -lead the meeting if requested. Our first convening was a discussion about barrie rs to vaccination. In the weeks following that first meeting, Columbia Pacific -CCO engaged in direct conversations with partners to gather additional perspectives, especially as the first vaccination clinics were being held. In March 2021, we helped conven e a second meeting, with a goal of sharing ideas, planning, and discussing what supports were needed to address system barriers that limit access to the COVID - 19 vaccine for those most impacted by COVID, and by th ose most affected by systemic inequities wi thin society. We also helped to convene partners within individual counties to develop shared plans to stand up mass vaccination sites, as vaccine supply starts to increase. What is a CCO? A Coordinated Care Organization (CCO) is a Medicaid managed care organization that provides coverage for Medicaid members in a specific region of the state. A CCO is a network of physical health care, addictions and mental health care and dental care providers. CCOs are local and have one budget that grows at a fixed rate for mental, physical and dental care. CCOs are accountable for the health outcomes of the population they serve. They are governed by a partnership among health care providers, community members, and stakeholders in the health systems that have financial responsibility and risk. https://www.oregon .gov/oha/hsd/ohp/pages/coord inated -care -organizations.aspx 41 | The barriers we identified through this work included: - Transportation access to vaccination events o Due to geography o Due to difficulties leaving the home o Due to age o Due to intellectual, developmental or physician disability - Interpretation services for English Language Learners - Assistance related to system navigation o Due to lack of in ternet o Lack of expertise / ability to use online attestation and scheduling systems - Supports for people with Serious Persistent Menta l Illness - Supports related to vaccine hesitancy ; need events that feel safe and are community led - Supports and access fo r those who are Houseless Equity toolkit Columbia Pacific -CCO created an equity toolkit that identifies six strategies (along with practical recommendations and resources) to support equitable vaccine distribution. The toolkit also described specific wa ys that organizations, like CCOs, can support vaccination efforts through its Community Engagement Team. The graphic on the next page show the elements of the equity toolkit. Funding and other practical support 42 | As a regional payer, Columbia Pacific -CCO was able to offer funding and other practical infrastructure support to promote vaccination equity across the three counties. Grants funded clinical and community partners who were taking action on vaccinating the community; grant funds help pay for su pplies, staff, signs, and other components of hosting a vaccination clinic. Columbia -Pacific CCO also supported the implementation of a centralized vaccine scheduling system in Tillamook County, called Block -It. At the request of the county, our team resea rched scheduling platforms, purchased the system, and is providing technical assistance for the county -wide rollout. This resource is available to any of the three counties, as requested. Equity -informed population data approach CareOregon, a no n-profit health Medicaid insurance company that serves the health care needs of low - income Oregonians , partnered with Columbia Pacific -CCO , to develop a way to use data analytics to inform its equity -first approach to vaccination . Together, CareOregon and Columbia -Pacific -CCO used their data, in concert with public health guidance , to identify and do outreach to communit ies and community members that might struggle to access the vaccine. CareOregon and CPCCO created a dashboard that included the following data ele ments: client race, ethnicity, language, age, chronic conditions (e.g., high risk CDC categories ), assigned PCP, county, zip code, and ACG frailty flag. These are data important to understanding equity that most primary care practices and community -based o rganizations in our region cannot access. Data are being monitored via the dashboard we created so that efforts can be refined, in real time, to get vaccines to populations, using a continuous quality improvement approach, in partnership with local publi c health. To date, we have been able to identify a number of opportunities to better serve community members, such as identify ing locations that could benefit from hosting vaccine events due to proximity of a high population of people with chronic conditio ns, transportation barriers , etc. This approach also allowed them to create outreach lists by county or clinic served. Importantly, the dashboard allows county leaders and clinics to track data and use a continual review process to assess new ways of outre aching to those needing to be vaccinated within prioritized groups.

Recommendations for welcoming BIPOC and other groups that are disproportionately impacted by COVID -19: The COVID -19 pandemic has highlighted health inequity rooted in the unjust living realities in many of our communities bo th urban and rural - especially for Black, Latinx, Indigenous, and Native Hawaiian/ Pacific Islander Americans. Members of these communities are at a disproportionately high risk of mortality and have low vaccination rates. When developing an equitable vac cination strategy, consider the following: 1. Be aware of implicit bias within your clinic . Taking steps to recognize and correct unconscious assumptions toward groups can promote health equity1. 2. Take the time to listen . Vaccine hesitancy has myriad reasons , and many patients are looking for answers to their questions from a trusted source (you!). Building trust and taking time to answer questions with today's evidence takes time and humility. But it is worth it. 3. Connect with community partners and resources . Provide information about outreach events, hours and same day accessibility to local churches, food banks, after -school centers and labor partners. Organize a listen and plan session with community leaders to tailor content messaging that resonates with community members and encourages vaccination. Community based organizations can help tailor communication content for varying health literacy and education levels, with an emphasis on ease of accessibility. 4. Recognize the barriers to equitable, quality heal th care in your community, and know where the resources are . Safety net clinics such as Federally Qualified Health Centers and the Local Public Health Authorities and in Oregon, the local CCOs will often have connections to social service resources that can assist with transportation to the clinic for vaccination, as well as resources for other needs preventing vaccination such as food and housing insecurity. 5. Provide language and culturally specific communication service s. Include American Sign Language an d braille in both outreach, registration, education and follow up information. Community based organizations can help to tailor content that is culturally specific and relevant to the community you serve. 6. Support populations with limited digital literacy by providing non -digital registration, educational materials, and resource options. Simplify the registration process and make it convenient and try to offer digital and non -digital options. 7. Offer vaccination during non -traditional hours or days of the wee k to provide access to individuals who cannot leave work, lack childcare or eldercare. to Identify, Understand, and Unlearn Implicit Bias in Patient Care. 44 | Chapter 8. Vaccination procedures This chapter provides training resources for your vaccinators, as well as vaccination instructions for each of the vaccines. For e xample, how to thaw the vaccine vials, how to reconstitute the Pfizer vaccine, how to fill syringes, administer the vaccine, monitor people after receiving the vaccination, and how to complete the vaccination record card. It also covers coding and billing for services. 8.1. Ordering vaccines Oregon is utilizing a hub and spoke distribution model for vaccine distribution. The Oregon Health Authority (OHA ) has identified thirteen Vaccine Redistribution Hubs for COVID -19 vaccine across the state, to widen vaccine access and prevent waste. All provide the Pfizer vaccine, with most of the Hubs providing other COVID -19 vaccines as well. Each Hub serves as a cen tral site to receive vaccines, store them for brief periods of time, repackage them into smaller batches, and redistribute them to clinics and other administering sites. Hubs will allow vaccinators such as clinics, pharmacies, and public health sites to ha ve smaller quantities of the Pfizer vaccine available in their conventional vaccine freezers and refrigerators, where they may be safely stored for up to 6 weeks. In addition, many Hubs are distributing Moderna and J&J vaccine, allowing providers to access small or large quantities of these vaccines that are already on hand in the state. Hubs provide COVID -19 vaccine to each region's enrolled pandemic vaccine providers, the \"Spokes.\" OHA is covering the operating costs of any Hubs that request reimbursemen t, so there is no cost to the Spokes for this service, and OHA has produced a Fact Sheet for each Hub that provides detail about its ordering and delivery process. You may request the Fact Sheet for your region's Hub by emailing COVID19.VaccineRequest@dhsoha.state.or.us . Note for sites deciding how much of the Pfizer vaccine to order: As of May 19, 2021, the FDA has authorized Pfizer vaccine to be stored for up to 2 weeks in a conventional vaccine freezer ( -25 to -15C) plus up to one month in a vaccine refrigerator (2 to 8C). This means that facilities without an ultra -cold freezer can safely store the Pfizer vaccine on site for up to 45 days. Note about Johnson & Johnson vaccine supply: While J&J is not available from the manufacturer as of July 2021, sites can obtain it by responding to the OHA's statewide vaccine request survey. Sites that are served by a Hub that handles J&J will receive the vaccine via delivery from the Hub. For other jurisdictions, the OHA will ship J&J directly to the enrolled vaccinator.

Follow aseptic technique. Perform hand hygiene before vaccine preparation, between patients, when changing gloves (if worn), and any time hand s become soiled.* 2. Remove vaccine from the freezer or refrigerator. Allow vaccine to come to room temperature. Vials can be held at room temperature for up to 2 hours before mixing. After 2 hours, return unmixed vials to the refrigerator. 3. Before mixing chec k the: o Expiration date on the vaccine and diluent o Any beyond use dates or times o NEVER use expired vaccine or diluent o NEVER use vaccine after the beyond -use dates or times 4. With the vaccine at room temperature, gently invert the vial 10 times. Do NOT shake t he vial. If the vial is shaken, contact the manufacturer. The vaccine is white to off -white in color and may contain opaque particles. Do not use if liquid is discolored. 5. Using a new, sterile alcohol prep pad for each vial, wipe off the stoppers of the dil uent and vaccine vials. 48 | 6. Using a 21 -gauge (or narrower) needle, withdraw 1.8 mL of 0.9% sodium chloride (normal saline, preservative -free) into a mixing syringe. After use, discard diluent vial and any remaining diluent. o Do NOT use or save the remaining vac cine diluent to mix additional vaccine or for other uses. o Do NOT use bacteriostatic normal saline or other diluents to mix the vaccine. 7. Inject 1.8 mL 0.9% sodium chloride (normal saline, preservative -free) diluent into the vaccine vial. 8. Using the mixing sy ringe, remove 1.8 mL of air from the vaccine vial to equalize the pressure in the vaccine vial. 9. Gently invert the vial containing vaccine and diluent 10 times. The vaccine will be off -white in color. Do not use if discolored or contains particulate matter. Do NOT shake. If the vial is shaken, contact the manufacturer. 10. Note the date and time the vaccine was mixed on the vial. 11. Keep mixed vaccine between 2C and 25C (36F and 77F) and administer within 6 hours. Discard any unused vaccine after 6 hours. Do not return to freezer storage. o Minimize exposure to room light, and avoid exposure to direct sunlight and ultraviolet light. 12. Choose the correct vaccine formulation based on the age of the recipient and equipment, including the correct needle size. o The vial for persons 12 years of age and older has a purple cap and may have a purple border on the label. Do NOT administer vaccin e with an orange cap or has an orange bordered label on the vial. o Use a new, sterile needle and syringe for each injection. o Low dead -volume syringes/needles can be used to extract 6 doses from a vial. If all low dead - volume syringes are not available use a combination of low dead -volume syringes and non -low dead -volume syringes. 13. Cleanse the stopper on the vial of mixed vaccine with a new, sterile alcohol prep pad. Withdraw 0.3 mL of mixed vaccine into the syringe. Ensure the prepared syringe is not cold to the touch. o Regardless of the type of syringe used, ensure the amount of vaccine in the syringe is 0.3mL. o If the amount of vaccine remaining in the vial cannot provide a full 0.3mL dose discard the vial and contents. o Do NOT combine vaccine from multiple via ls to obtain a dose. 14. Remove any significant air bubbles with the needle still in the vial to avoid loss of vaccine. Use the same needle to withdraw and administer the vaccine, unless contaminated or damaged. Check the vial label, again, to ensure it is th e correct formulation based on the age of the recipient. *Gloves are not required unless the person administering the vaccine is likely to come in contact with potentially infectious body fluids or has open lesions on the hands. If worn, perform hand hygie ne and change gloves between patients. It is not necessary to change needles between drawing vaccine from a vial and injecting it into a recipient unless the needle has been damaged or contaminated. How to Prepare the Pediatric Vaccine 1. Follow aseptic tec hnique. Perform hand hygiene before vaccine preparation, between patients, when changing gloves (if worn), and any time hands become soiled. 2. Remove vaccine from the storage unit. Check the vial label to ensure it is the correct formulation based on the age of the recipient. The vial for children 5 through 11 years of age has an orange cap and orange border on the label. Allow vaccine to come to room temperature. Vials can be held at room temperature at room temperature for up to 2 hours before mixing. 3. Befo re mixing, check the: 49 | Age indications on the label Expiration date of the vaccine and diluent Any beyond -use dates/times NEVER use expired vaccine or diluent.

Encourage people to enroll in V axText, a free text messaging to receive COVID -19 vaccine second dose reminders: VaxTextSM COVID -19 Vaccination Second -Dose Reminder . If you do not have ample supply of vacci nation record cards, you may need to make additional photocopies. 8.8. Considerations when setting a date for dose 2 for Pfizer and Moderna 8.8.a. Setting a date for dose 2 and 3 - Pfizer https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid -19/info -by-product/pfizer/index.html Second dose: Persons age 5 years and older should receive 2 doses at least 21 days apart . Range: 17 -42 days Second doses administered up to 4 days before the recommended date (17 or more days after first dose) are considered valid. However, doses administered earlier do not need to be repeated. Second doses should be administered as close to the recommended interval as possible. o Do not use the grace period to s chedule appointments for the second dose. There is no maximum interval between the first and second dose. Both doses should be Pfizer -BioNTech COVID -19 Vaccine. o Every effort should be made to determine which vaccine product was received as the first dose. o In exceptional situations, if the vaccine product given as the first dose cannot be determined or is no longer available, any mRNA COVID -19 vaccine product may be administered at least 28 days after the first dose. Third dose: Moderately to severely immun ocompromised people: Consider an additional dose at least 28 days after the initial 2 -dose primary series . 56 | 8.8.b.

Coding for services related to COVID -19 vaccines and immunization administration and counseling This information comes from the American Academy of Pediatrics The CPT Editorial Pan el has developed several new SARS -CoV-2 vaccine product and immunization administration codes. The new CPT codes clinically distinguish each coronavirus vaccine product and the specific dose for better tracking, reporting, and analysis allow for unique CPT vaccine administration codes for each vaccine product o This includes unique codes for a 1st dose of a single product and a 2nd dose 57 | This level of specificity is a first for vaccine administration codes, and offers the ability to track each vaccine dose, e ven when the vaccine product is not reported (eg, when the vaccine may be given to the patient for free). The CPT codes for the administration include: clinic expense costs of storage and ordering counseling provided to patients or caregivers on the date t he vaccine is administered administering the vaccine updating the electronic health record and the vaccine registry Note you will not report the immunization administration codes (90460 -90461, 90471 -90474) when administering a Coronavirus vaccine. Vacc ine Counseling Coding Vaccine Counseling with No Administration There may be occasions when a patient or parent presents to their medical home for vaccine counseling, particularly for the COVID -19 vaccine. Increasing vaccine hesitancy surrounding this vac cine may be greater and some older adolescents may seek out information on their own. There are many mechanisms by which you can get information out to your patients, however, for those who opt for in -person (ie, in office or telehealth) individual counsel ing there are coding options. You should check with your payers for guidance on the most appropriate way to code as some have limitations on the use of Z codes with office -based E/M services (eg, 99212). Note, if you provide vaccine counseling on the day y ou also administer the vaccine to the patient you may not report counseling separately. Coding options include: ICD-10-CM codes Z71.89 Other specified counseling Z28.21 Immunization not carried out because of patient refusal Z28.82 Immunization not carried out because of caregiver refusal CPT Options: 99201 -99215 Office -based with the patient/caregiver. 99401 -99404 Preventive Medicine Counseling: based on time spent counseling (Note this code is not listed as an approved tel ehealth service). May not be used for group counseling. 58 | 99411 -99412 Preventive Medicine Group Counseling: Used for group visits when discussing vaccine safety Coding Tips: You will not report a 90460, 90461, 90471 \u201490474 with any COVID -19 vaccine administ ration code. Report only one vaccine administration code per COVID -19 injection If you see the patient for a significant and separately identifiable E/M service in addition to the COVID - 19 vaccine, append modifier 25 to the E/M service. For example, you se e a patient for a routine preventive medicine service (eg, 99394) and they decide to get the COVID -19 vaccine, report the 99394 and the appropriate product (as required) and the administration code only. Counseling is captured in the COVID -19 vaccine admin istration code. Your ICD -10-CM code for COVID -19 vaccine administration is Z23 Patients with Private Insurance Coverage Bill insurance using the appropriate CPT code as outlined in the coding guidance above. Some private payers appear to reject or deny c laims if the product code (9130x) is listed on the claim. For these payers, send only the administration code (00xxA). Patients without Coverage Uninsured people receive COVID -19 vaccine through the CDC's COVID -19 Vaccination Program. Payment for vaccine administration is available directly from HRSA via the COVID -19 Uninsured Program Portal. You will be paid the current Medicare rate for COVID vaccine claims. Participation in the C DC COVID -19 Vaccination Program requires the following steps: 1. Enrolling as a provider participant (through UnitedHealth Group and Optum ID), 2. 2. Checking patient eligibility o To do so, you must first upload a spreadsheet of patients for whom you would like t o submit claims to the HRSA COVID -19 Uninsured website. Download a template for the spreadsheet Once you have uploaded this spreadsheet to the H RSA COVID website, it takes about 24 hours for the patients to be verified as self -pay and a temporary COVID -19 Uninsured ID will be provided. 3. Submitting patient information o You may use this \"Uninsured ID\" just like you would a child's insurance ID 4. Submit ting claims o Submit claims electronically to the COVID Fund using your typical claims submission process. 5. Receiving payment via direct deposit. Providers who participate in the COVID -19 Vaccination Program must confirm that the patient is uninsured and agree not to balance bill recipients . Providers should refer to their local public health jurisdiction for information on enrolling in the program. 59 | Chapter 9.

Scheduling and documenting outside the EHR : White Bird Clinic, Eugene, Oregon When White Bird Clinic in Eugene, Oregon was approached by the Lane County Health Department in December 2020 to begin a community vaccine clinic, th ey started out by scheduling and documenting using their NextGen EHR system. Shortly, they began to experience limitations and bottlenecks caused by this method: (1) they were getting too much information about people through their regular new patient registration workflow; (2) the community members that were added as new patients for vaccination clinics would have skewed the clinic's actual patient panel numbers and demographics; (3) there was a significant staff time commitment involved in completing the new patient registration workflow for dozens of people ahead of each vaccination clinic event. White Bird considered customizing NextGen (creating a vaccine clinic location to separate the vaccine panel from the primary care panel, for example) but the tim e involved was daunting. White Bird began using the SOLV platform in early February 2021 after hearing that an FQHC in Washington was using it. The cost was: $500 for set -up, then $500/month for the first site, $400/month for the second site, etc. SOLV is a secure, HIPAA compliant, web -based program. White Bird uses SOLV for pre -registration, consent, and appointment -scheduling. The clinic also uses it for capturing the vaccine documentation information that is later mass uploaded into Alert IIs, the state vaccine registry system. At their main vaccine site (a music hall), White Bird is using the clinic's older laptop computers that had been taken out of circulation because they were too slow to run the EHR. These computers were wiped and the Chrome browser was installed. At the vaccine clinic, the staff have two tabs open in Chrome: SOLV and ALERT. Because SOLV is a secure encrypted site, they only need a wifi connection; they don't need VPN. The clinic also has a couple of iPads on site for people who have n't fully completed their registration. They are using ALERT to confirm first doses for any community member who comes for a second dose. The registration information collected via the SOLV form includes all the information that White Bird, as an FQHC, wi ll need to include in UDS reporting. The form also collects insurance information, with a clear message that people will never need to pay for a vaccine, but the clinic might bill their insurance at some point. The clinic already needs to combine several d ata sources for UDS reporting, so adding the SOLV data won't significantly increase the reporting burden. (This may not be the experience of other FQHCs that have a unified data source such as a robust EHR.) The clinic offers several communication pathwa ys to meet the needs of community members: (1) A person can use the link on the White Bird vaccination clinic page ( https://whitebirdclinic.org/vaccine ) to complete the registration information, consent to the vaccine, and schedule their appointment. About two -thirds of White Bird's vaccine clinic clients use this method, and it has dramatically reduced the staff burden related to scheduling and registration. This freed up resources to more directly support people who use the other communication pathways. 60 | (2) Next to the registration link on the White Bird vaccination clinic webpage, there is a phone number that anyone can call. In White Bird's experience so far, this includes community elders, people experiencing homelessness, and other community members who may ha ve barriers to online registration. When people call, they leave a voicemail. A staff member or volunteer calls them back and uses the SOLV form to complete the registration and scheduling on behalf of the community member. (3) Spanish -speakers, a priority pop ulation for White Bird, are provided the phone number to the White Bird dental clinic front desk via information in Spanish on the vaccination web page. The dental clinic is a secondary vaccination site, and many staff members are bilingual. The front offi ce staff use SOLV to complete the registration and scheduling on behalf of the community member. Using the SOLV program has enabled the clinic to scale up its vaccine efforts; it expects to be vaccinating 850 - 900 people each week. Due to the low tech requirements, they will also be able to use SOLV in their mobile vaccination vans targeting people experiencing homelessness, planned to begin after March 29. They have also been able to utilize their clinic volunteers, who have been sidelined for most of the pandemic, to help register people from home using the voicemail system.
