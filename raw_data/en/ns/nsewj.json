With a potent and natural plethora of Ayurvedic products, we help you strike a balance between your state of physical, mental, and spiritual well-being. What Are Doshas And How Do They Determine Our Health? Ayurveda has maintained since ancient times that there are three core categories or types of substances that are believed to be present in a person's body and mind. These are referred to as 'Doshas'. At birth, each being is born with a set of characteristics, known as their 'Prakriti', which consists of the three Doshas- namely Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. These doshas are believed to be responsible for a person's physiological, mental, and emotional health, and each person's unique ratio of Vata, Kapha, and Pitta is said to define their Ayurvedic constitution. The Vata Dosha Starting with the first Dosha, Vata represents the two elements of air and space (ether) and is generally described as cold, light, dry, rough, flowing, and spacious. Usually described as slim, energetic, and creative, people with an overactive Vata are known for thinking outside the box but can become easily distracted. People with an overactive Vata are likely to be more forgetful, anxious, moody, highly sensitive to the cold, have trouble sleeping, have an irregular appetite and eating patterns, and are more prone to digestive issues and gas, and poor circulation. An overactive Vata, when identified, can be effectively treated using selected Balance Ayurveda products that help manage issues related to a prominent Vata dosha. The Pitta Dosha Based on the element of fire, people with prominent Pitta doshas are known to be highly motivated, goal-oriented, and competitive. But, governed by heat, their aggressive and tenacious nature can lead to conflict. On the plus side, people with a Pitta Dosha have a quick metabolism, good circulation, and healthy skin, and hair, but on the flip side, they are impatient, prone to conflict, prone to acne and inflammation, and sensitive to hot temperatures. Those with pitta-dominant dosha must focus on work-life balance and avoid extreme heat, along with the right Balance Ayurveda products to manage their health. The Kapha Dosha Representing the operations of Water and Earth energy, people with this dosha are described as strong, thick-boned, and caring. They rarely get upset, think before acting, and go through life in a slow, deliberate manner. Although they have a healthy immune system, they are prone to weight gain, slow metabolism, sluggishness, over-sleeping, breathing issues, higher risk of heart disease, and mucus buildup, and depression. Along with the help of Balance Ayurveda's Ayurvedic products online, a Kapha-dominant person should focus on regular exercise, a healthy diet, and maintaining a warm body temperature.
