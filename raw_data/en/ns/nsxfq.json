The scope of research includes laboratory investigations, clinical research, and public health studies. We conduct research on South Africa's quadruple burden of disease: maternal, newborn and child health, HIV/AIDS and TB, non-communicable diseases, and interpersonal violence. Our work is to acquire evidence-based information to inform health policy and practice and improve the quality and health status of people in South Africa. "}
