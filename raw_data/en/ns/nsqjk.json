For a large population, as in India, these forms have been easy to gather, make, or inexpensive to purchase. Fresh herbs have the most complete healing properties while dried herbs and medicated oils being a close second choice. Essential oils no longer have the minerals and water-soluble components, so they are a third choice. However, they are concentrated, easy to use, and don't lose potency or spoil. In today's busy world, essential oils can be a readily available ally in healing. Essential oils for Vata constitutions should be wet, heavy, calming and warming to counteract the characteristics of this dosha. Some examples are lavender, sage, chamomile, rosewood, sandalwood, patchouli, rose and cypress. Essential oils to balance Pitta should have a cooling, drying, nutritive and calming effect. Among these we find peppermint, spearmint, tea tree, lemongrass, fennel, lime and Ylang Ylang. Essential oils to balance Kapha require warming, drying, lightening and stimulating properties such as cinnamon, mint, juniper, basil, camphor and ginger. At JothiVita, we use Aromatherapy extensively to promote dosha balancing. We select pure essential oils from different parts of the world - the majority is certified organic - to elaborate custom blends for our clients. "}
