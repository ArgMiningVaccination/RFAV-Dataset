Because of the range of symptoms, this condition is now called autism spectrum disorder (ASD). [1] Doctors typically diagnose autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in childhood when symptoms can occur before 3 years of age, according to the American [Autism](https://homoeopathic.in/psychiatry/mental-disorders/autism/) Association. According to the Centers for Disease Control, autism affects an estimated 1 in 59 children in the United States today. [2] The word \"autism\" comes from the Greek word \"autos,\" which means \"self.\" It describes conditions in which a person is removed from social interaction. In other words, he becomes an \"isolated self.\" Symptom covered in ASD: It covers a large spectrum of symptoms, skills, and levels of impairment. ASD ranges in severity from a disability that somewhat limits an otherwise normal life to a devastating disability that may require institutional care. [1] While different types of ASD occur, common experiences among people with the condition include impairment in social situations and the adoption of repetitive behaviors. Some children with autism might seem to show symptoms from birth, while others may develop more obvious signs as they become older. [Autism](https://homoeopathic.in/psychiatry/mental-disorders/autism/) also has links to other medical conditions, such as epilepsy and tuberous sclerosis complex. According to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), an estimated 20 to 30 percent of people with ASD develop epilepsy by the time they reach childhood. [2] The causes of autism are currently not known, but significant numbers of studies are underway with a view to learning how it develops. Genetic Factors: Researchers have identified several genes that appear to have connections to ASD. Occasionally, these genes arise by spontaneously mutate. In other cases, people may inherit them. In studies of twins, autism often has a strong correlation between twins. e.g., if one twin has autism, the other is likely to have autism an estimated 36 to 95 percent of the time, according to the NINDS. Vaccination: Another common misconception surrounding autism is that receiving vaccines, such as those for [measles](https://homoeopathic.in/infectious-disease/viral-infections/measles/), mumps, and rubella (MMR), can contribute to autism. However, the CDC report that there is no known connection between vaccines and autism. In detail, A 2013 study confirmed that the number of antigens, or substances that trigger the production of disease-fighting antibodies are the same in children who do and do not have ASD. Some people claim that thimerosal, a preservative that contains mercury and is in specific vaccines, has links to autism. However, at least nine different studies since 2003 have provided evidence that counters this claim. The Lancet journal published the initial paper that triggered the controversy around vaccines and autism and retracted it 12 years later after evidence of data tampering, and research fraud became clear. Others: In brief, Those with autism may also undergo changes in key areas of their brains that impact their speech and behavior. Environmental factors might also play a role in the development of ASD, although doctors have not yet confirmed a link. However, researchers do know that some rumored causes, such as parenting practices, do not cause autism. [2] Risk Factors - Having a sibling with ASD - Having certain genetic or chromosomal conditions, such as fragile X syndrome or tuberous sclerosis - Experiencing complications at birth - Being born to older parents[4] Pathophysiology Various theories where proposed in order to explain the pathophysiology underlying ASD. Despite the fact that none of them is able to completely explain the impairments in the nervous system of ASD patients, these hypotheses were instrumental in highlighting the most important mechanisms in the development of this complex disorder. Some new theories are based on neovascularization studies, others on the data from genomic studies, which become increasingly available worldwide. As the research in this field is largely dependent on the animal models, there is an ongoing discussion and search for the most appropriate one adequately reproducing the pathology. Here we provide an overview of current theories of the origin and development of ASD discussed in the context of existing and proposed rodent models of ASD.[6] Types of [Autism](https://homoeopathic.in/psychiatry/mental-disorders/autism/) - Asperger's syndrome. These children don't have a problem with language; in fact, they tend to score in the average or above-average range on intelligence tests. But they have social problems and a narrow scope of interests. - Autistic disorder. This is what most people think of when they hear the word \"autism.\" It refers to problems with social interactions, communication, and play in children younger than 3 years. - Childhood disintegrative disorder. These children have typical development for at least 2 years and then lose some or most of their communication and social skills. - Pervasive developmental disorder (PDD or atypical autism). Your doctor might use this term if your child has some autistic behavior, like delays in social and communications skills, but doesn't fit into another category.[5] The common thread is differences in social skills, communication, and behavior compared with people who aren't on the spectrum. Social Skills: - Adoption of unusual speech patterns, such as using a robot-like tone - Avoiding eye contact with others - Not responding to their name - Prefers to be alone. - Doesn't understand emotions - his own or others' - Apparent difficulty in understanding feelings also expressing their own Communication: About 40% of kids with autism spectrum disorders don't talk at all, and between 25% and 30% develop some language skills during infancy but then lose them later. Some children with ASD start talking later in life. Most have some problems with communication, i.e.: - Delayed speech and language skills - Having difficulty with maintaining conversation - Flat, either robotic speaking voice, or singsong voice - Echolalia (repeating the same phrase over and over) - Problems with pronouns (saying \"you\" instead of \"I,\" for example) - Not using or rarely using common gestures (in other words, pointing or waving), and not responding to them - Inability to stay on topic when talking or answering questions - Not recognizing sarcasm or joking Patterns of Behavior: Children with ASD also act in ways that seem unusual or have interests that aren't typical. For Instance: - Repetitive behaviors such as hand-flapping, rocking, jumping, or twirling - Constant moving (in other words pacing) and \"hyper\" behavior - Fixations on certain activities or objects - Specific routines or rituals (and getting upset when a routine is changed, even slightly) - Extreme sensitivity to touch, light, and sound - Fussy eating habits - Lack of coordination, clumsiness - Impulsiveness (in other words, acting without thinking) - Aggressive behavior, both with self and others - Short attention span [1] Investigation This might include i.e. - hearing and vision tests or - genetic tests[5] Milestones - Did your baby smile by 6 months? - Did he mimic sounds and facial expressions by 9 months? - Was he babbling and cooing by 12 months? Also, Physician will ask about these things: - Are any of his behaviors unusual or repetitive? - Does he have trouble making eye contact? - Does he interact with people and share experiences? - Is his tone of voice \"flat\"? - Does he understand other people's actions? - Is he sensitive to light, noise, or temperature? - Any problems with sleep or digestion? - Does he tend to get annoyed or angry? Your responses are very important in your child's screening. If everything checks out and you have no concerns, that's the end of it. [1] Differential Diagnosis - Learning Disability/Intellectual Disability (LD/ID) [ADHD](https://homoeopathic.in/psychiatry/mental-disorders/attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-adhd/) - Social Communication Disorder (SCD) - Gifted and Talented - Anxiety - Language Disorder - Hearing Impairment - Attachment Disorder - Regression and Rett's - Genetic disorders and Syndromic - Epilepsy - Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) - Sensory Processing Difficulties (SPD) - Vision Impairment (VI)[7] There is no uniform treatment for autism, as every person with the condition presents differently. Therapies and strategies are available for managing the health issues that often accompany autism. These issues can include epilepsy, depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and sleep disturbances. While not all of these treatments will be effective for all people with ASD, there are many options to consider that may help people cope. [2] Behavior and Communication Treatments: Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA): ABA is often used in schools and clinics to help your child learn positive behaviors and reduce negative ones. This approach can be used to improve a wide range of skills, and there are different types for different situations, such as: - Discrete trial training (DTT) uses simple lessons and positive reinforcement. - Pivotal response training (PRT) helps develop motivation to learn and communicate. - Early intensive behavioral intervention (EIBI) is best for children under age 5. - Verbal behavior intervention (VBI) focuses on language skills. [1] Floortime i.e.: - This involves parents joining children in the play area and building relationships. ABA therapies might also use floortime to support treatment and vice versa. - Through this engagement, a child with ASD learns two-way and complex communication, emotional thought, and intimacy. - They also learn to take the lead of regulating themselves and engaging with their environment. [2] Treatment and Education of Autistic and Related Communication-handicapped Children (TEACCH) i.e.: - This treatment uses visual cues such as picture cards to help your child learn everyday skills like getting dressed. Information is broken down into small steps so he can learn it more easily. [1] - This program helps to integrate the needs of children with autism into a classroom environment, with an emphasis on visual learning and support for the attention and communication difficulties that might arise. - Special education providers and social workers, as well as medical professionals providing other treatments, such as psychologists and speech therapists, can use this system to support children with ASD. [2] The Picture Exchange Communication System (PECS) i.e.: - This is another visual-based treatment, but it uses symbols instead of picture cards. Your child learns to ask questions and communicate through special symbols. [2] Relationship development intervention (RDI): - This treatment revolves around the importance of dynamic thinking, or the ability to adapt thoughts and process situations flexibly, to help improve quality of life in people with autism. - The focus of RDI includes understanding other people's perspectives, processing change, and absorbing information from several sources at once, such as sight and sound, without experiencing distress. [2] Occupational Therapy such as: - This kind of treatment helps your child learn life skills like feeding and dressing himself, bathing, and understanding how to relate to other people. The skills he learns are meant to help him live as independently as he can. [1] - People with ASD then practice these skills outside of the therapy sessions, which are usually between 30 and 60 minutes long. [2] Sensory Integration Therapy such as: - If your child is easily upset by things like bright lights, certain sounds, or the feeling of being touched, this therapy can help him learn to deal with that kind of sensory information. [1] Speech therapy i.e.: - This helps to address the challenges in communication that people with autism might experience. - Assistance might include matching emotions with facial expressions, learning how to interpret body language, and responding to questions. - A speech therapist might also try to teach the nuances of vocal tone and help the individual strengthen their speech and clarity. [2] Medications: There is no cure for autism spectrum disorder, and there's currently no medication to treat it. But some medicines can help with related symptoms like depression, seizures, insomnia, also trouble focusing. Studies have shown that medication is most effective when it's combined with behavioral therapies. Risperidone (Risperdal) is the only drug approved by the FDA for children with autism spectrum disorder. It can be prescribed for children between 5 and 16 years old to help with irritability. Some doctors will prescribe other drugs in certain cases, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), anti-anxiety medications, or stimulants, but they're not FDA-approved for autism spectrum disorder. Talk with your child's doctor about whether there are medicines that treat his symptoms. [1] In rare cases, doctors also say, a baby can be born with birth defects if the mother was exposed to certain chemicals while she was pregnant. But doctors can't find out, during your pregnancy, if your baby will have autism. While you can't prevent having a child with an autistic disorder, you can increase your odds of having a healthy baby by doing these lifestyle changes: Live healthy i.e.: Have regular check-ups, eat well-balanced meals, and exercise. Make sure you have good prenatal care, and take all recommended vitamins and supplements. Don't take drugs during pregnancy i.e.: Ask your doctor before you take any medication. This is especially true for some antiseizure drugs. Avoid alcohol i.e.: Say \"no\" to that glass of wine and any kind of alcoholic beverage \u2014 while you're pregnant. Seek treatment for existing health conditions i.e.: If you've been diagnosed with celiac disease or PKU, follow your doctor's advice for keeping them under control. Get vaccinated i.e.: Make sure you get the German measles (rubella) vaccine before you get pregnant. It can prevent rubella-associated autism. [1] Homeopathic Treatment of [Autism](https://homoeopathic.in/psychiatry/mental-disorders/autism/) Homeopathy treats the person as a whole. It means that homeopathic treatment focuses on the patient as a person, as well as his pathological condition. The homeopathic medicines selected after a full individualizing examination and case-analysis. Which includes - The medical history of the patient, - Physical and mental constitution, - Family history, - Presenting symptoms, - Underlying pathology, - Possible causative factors etc. A miasmatic tendency (predisposition/susceptibility) also often taken into account for the treatment of chronic conditions. What Homoeopathic doctors do? A homeopathy doctor tries to treat more than just the presenting symptoms. The focus is usually on what caused the disease condition? Why 'this patient' is sick 'this way'? The disease diagnosis is important but in homeopathy, the cause of disease not just probed to the level of bacteria and viruses. Other factors like mental, emotional and physical stress that could predispose a person to illness also looked for. Now a days, even modern medicine also considers a large number of diseases as psychosomatic. The correct homeopathy remedy tries to correct this disease predisposition. The focus is not on curing the disease but to cure the person who is sick, to restore the health. If a disease pathology not very advanced, homeopathy remedies do give a hope for cure but even in incurable cases, the quality of life can greatly improve with homeopathic medicines. Homeopathic Medicines for [Autism](https://homoeopathic.in/psychiatry/mental-disorders/autism/): The homeopathic remedies (medicines) given below indicate the therapeutic affinity but this is not a complete and definite guide to the homeopathy treatment of this condition. The symptoms listed against each homeopathic remedy may not be directly related to this disease because in homeopathy general symptoms and constitutional indications also taken into account for selecting a remedy, potency and repetition of dose by Homeopathic doctor. So, here we describe homeopathic medicine only for reference and education purpose. Do not take medicines without consulting registered homeopathic doctor ( [BHMS](https://mddoctorsclinic.com/) or M.D. Homeopath). Homeopathy is one of the most popular holistic systems of medicine. The selection of homeopathic remedy for [Autism](https://homoeopathic.in/psychiatry/mental-disorders/autism/) is based upon the theory of individualization and symptoms similarity by using holistic approach.

Special Diets: There's no hard evidence that special diets help children with ASD. [Autism](https://homoeopathic.in/psychiatry/mental-disorders/autism/) is a complex brain disorder. While it may seem that cutting out certain foods could relieve your child's symptoms, it might actually cause more harm. For example, children with autism often have thinner bones. Dairy products contain nutrients that can help to make them stronger. There have been studies on a protein in milk products called casein. They found that many children performed the same whether they or not they ate foods that contained this protein. Ask the Experts: Your child's diet needs to support her specific nutritional needs and ASD symptoms. The best approach is to work with your doctor and a nutrition specialist \u2014 like a registered dietician. They'll help you design a meal plan tailored for your child. Some children with autism have digestive problems like constipation, belly pain, or nausea and vomiting. Your doctor can suggest a diet that won't make them worse. And remember, nutritional needs change over time. Your child's dietician will help you make sure the foods she eats are still meeting her needs as she gets older. Can Supplements Help? Many studies show they can boost nutrition and calm some symptoms of ASD. You might want to ask your doctor about the following: Fatty acids: Essential fatty acids or EFAs help the brain and immune system develop. Omega-3 and omega-6 are excellent sources. Your body doesn't make them, so you'll have to get them either from food you eat, or from supplements. Vitamins and minerals: It's common for autistic children to not get enough of these. Much of the time, they stem from very strict eating habits. Vitamin and mineral supplements can help balance your child's system and make sure she's getting the nutrients her body needs.
