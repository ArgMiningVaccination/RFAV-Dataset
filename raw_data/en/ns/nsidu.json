The goals of palliative medicine are the same as those of your oncologists: to help you co pe and live with your cancer, as well as you can, for as long as you can . Your physician may suggest consultation with a palliative medicine specialist if he or she thinks it could help maintain or improve your quality of life. What do Palliative Care P ractitioners do? Palliative care teams have specialized training in: x Cancer related symptom management, including: o Cancer - or treatment -related pain; o Shortness of breath; o Nausea, vomiting or loss of appetite; o Fatigue or difficulty sleeping. x Anxiety or depression related to living with cancer and undergoing treatment: x Advance care planning (thinking about living with your illness, helping you make decisions about your care, and making plans for your future) Who is Part of the Palliative Care Team? Physi cians, nurse -practitioners, and nurses who will work in collaboration with your oncology physicians and nurses. When is the Right Time for Consultation with the Palliative Care Team? At any point you, your family, or your doctors feel that you may need he lp with your symptoms or coping with your illness. Feel free to call 312-926-0001 to discuss your questions. Is Palliative Care the Same as Hospice? No. Palliative care can be part of the care play for any patient with a chronic illness, no matter what t he prognosis may be. Patients can (and often do) receive anti -cancer therapy and palliative care at the same time. The goal is to help you live as well as you can, for as long as you can. The goals of hospice are the same - helping you live as well as y ou can - but hospice is more for patients who no longer want or cannot tolerate anti -cancer therapy. Will Palliative Medicine Consultation be Covered by Insurance? Your Palliative Medicine consultation will be billed separately from your oncologist's visit. Most insurance plans, including Medicare, cover Palliative Medicine consultations as part of your overall care. You may need to pay an additional co -payment. Please ask the clinic staff if you have any questions. Supportive Care and Palliative Medicine: What is it? NCCN!Guidelines!for!Patients!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

The NCCN Guidelines for Patients\u00ae are supported by charitable donations made to the NCCN questions or concerns about the CT scan, please ask the Radiology staff.Computed Tomography(CT) ScanA computed tomography (CT) scan is a special way of looking inside your body. The images produced are cross-sectional planes taken from a part of your body, much like slices taken out of a loaf of bread. The length of the exam will depend upon the area to be scanned and specific information needed by your doctors. The CT scan is done in the Radiology (X-ray) department.Please tell your doctor or the X-ray staff if you: Are pregnant, might be pregnant, are trying to get pregnant or are breastfeeding. Are allergic to contrast dye. Are on dialysis or have known kidney disease. Are diabetic. Have had a problem with this exam (or other contrast exams) in the past.Preparation for the TestIf you have a contrast dye allergy or are taking metformin (Glucophage\u00ae, Glucophage XR\u00ae, Glucovance\u00ae), you will be given special medication instructions. It is important that you follow these instructions carefully.For dialysis patients, the CT scan may need to be scheduled on the same day as your dialysis treatment.Patients over the age of 70 or those having known risk factors may require kidney function tests.Other preparations for the CT scan will vary depending on the area of the body to be examined. Your doctor will inform you of any needed preparations. These may include: Pregnancy testing and advice for withholding breastfeeding. Diet restrictions. Proper fluid intake. Laxatives or bowel preparations.Patient EducationTESTS AND PROCEDURES Patients First Patients will need to change into a hospital gown for this exam. Outpatients will be shown to a dressing area for changing. You will need to remove any loose or hanging jewelry, such as necklaces. It is not usually necessary to remove rings or watches, but you may choose to do so for comfort.For certain tests, you may be asked to drink a liquid contrast agent. This oral contrast agent outlines the stomach and bowel on the pictures and will make certain parts of your body appear bright on the pictures. This step is important in obtaining accurate results. If you have any stomach upset or diarrhea, please tell the CT staff.Another contrast agent, a dye, may be needed during the scan. This is injected through an IV (into the vein) line. This line may be started before the CT scan begins.During the TestBefore the test begins, the CT staff will explain the test and the equipment used. You will be asked to lie on a table connected to the CT scan machine. The technologist (tech) will line up the part of your body to be examined. The table will then move so that you are in the center of the machine. The tech will keep in contact with you throughout the exam by intercom.As the exam begins, it is very important that you lie still and follow the instructions of the tech and doctor. The tech may ask you to hold your breath several times during the test.If needed, a doctor, nurse, or tech will inject the IV contrast. As it is injected, you may feel warm and flushed or feel the urge to urinate. You may also note a metallic taste in your mouth. These are normal effects, although most people will feel nothing at all. Please tell the staff right away if you note any of the following: Shortness of breath. Hives. Itching.After the TestYou may resume your normal activities and diet after the test. If you received a contrast agent during the test, it is suggested that you drink an additional 1 or 2 glasses of water. The contrast agent will not discolor your urine. Although it is rare to have any delayed allergic reactions, contact the CT department or your doctor if any rash or swelling occurs.If you received an oral preparation, you may notice a change in the color and frequency of your bowel movements. If any change lasts more than 2 to 3 days, please contact your doctor.2If you have any questions or concerns about this test, please ask your doctor, nurse or Radiology staff.Radiation SafetyCT scans use radiation to produce images needed for diagnosis and treatment. There are risks to radiation exposure. It is important to talk with your doctor before having the test to learn about: Its risks and benefits. The reason for the test.At Northwestern Memorial Hospital (NMH), we are committed to your safety. This means that your scan will be done with the least amount of radiation without reducing the quality of the exam.The NMH CT department is proud to be accredited by the American College of Radiology (ACR).

A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) exam is a special way of looking inside your body. It is different from an X-ray. It uses a magnetic field and radio waves to create the pictures. During the test, a contrast agent (dye) may be given. This makes certain parts of your body appear brighter on the pictures.The exam time depends upon the area to be scanned and the information needed by your doctors. Most exams last about45 to 60 minutes. The MRI is done in the Radiology (X-ray) Department. Northwestern Memorial Hospital offers the option of 4 locations: Feinberg Pavilion at 251 E. Huron St. 441 E. Ontario St. 1913 W. North Ave. in Chicago's Bucktown neighborhood. Prentice Women's Hospital at 250 E.

This includes polyps, which can, over time, develop into cancer. It also is helpful in finding the cause of diarrhea, bleeding or changes in bowel habits.The test, done in the GI Lab, takes about 30 minutes. But your total time in the lab is about 2\u00bd to 3 hours. During the exam, a small flexible tube is inserted into the rectum and to the colon. At the end of the tube is a tiny video camera with a light. This test may be more helpful than X-rays alone since the doctor may: Actually view the area. Remove polyps. Take a small tissue sample (biopsy).The colon must be fully emptied so the doctor can view the area. Depending on the exam time and your needs, the bowel prep may vary. Your doctor will give you specific written instructions. Follow these bowel prep guidelines carefully. Be sure to obtain this instruction sheet from your doctor. Your doctor will give a Patient Questionnaire form and Patient Medication List to you to complete and bring with you on the day of the exam.Before the Test14 Days Before the TestTalk with your doctor about your routine medicines. It is important to tell the doctor if you: Are on any \"blood-thinning\" medicines such as anti- coagulants, aspirin, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Are taking an iron supplement. Are a diabetic or have problems with low blood sugar. Take antibiotics prior to certain medical procedures. Have an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD).Patient EducationTESTS AND PROCEDURES Patients First Blood thinning medications and iron supplements are often stopped 7 days before the colonoscopy. Diabetics need to follow their doctor's guidelines for how to adjust oral medications and insulin.7 Days Before the TestFollow your doctor's guidelines on how to take: Iron supplements. Anticoagulants or prescribed blood thinners. Any medications containing aspirin. NSAIDs including ibuprofen (Advil\u00ae, Motrin\u00ae.)If you are unsure about the medicines included in these groups, ask your doctor or pharmacist. Acetaminophen (Tylenol\u00ae) may be taken for minor pain.Purchase the bowel prep (NuLytely\u00ae, Suprep\u00ae, Moviprep\u00ae) ordered by your doctor. These are found at most drug stores.Day Before the TestRefer to your doctor's instruction sheet for your specific prep including: Liquid diet guidelines. Bowel prep (NuLytely\u00ae, Suprep\u00ae, Moviprep\u00ae.)If you have any questions, please call your doctor's office or you may contact theGastrointestinal (GI) Lab patient care coordinator at 312-926-7614.Day of the TestUnless told otherwise, take all routine medicines (except blood thinners, aspirin, NSAIDs) on the morning of your exam with sips of water. Follow your doctor's diet guidelines. Remember, sips of water are allowed until 3 hours before the exam.It is helpful to wear loose, comfortable clothes on the day of the exam. Be sure to bring the completed Patient Questionnaire form and Patient Medication List and plan to have a responsible adult to take you home after the exam.Please arrive at the GI Lab 30 minutes before your test. It is located at the Galter Pavilion, 201 E. Huron St. Take the elevators to the 4th floor and go to the front desk check-in area.Parking is available for patients and visitors in the garage at 222 E.

The IV is used for giving medicine during the exam. The doctor will explain the exam and answer any questions you may have. You will be asked to sign a written consent.During the ExamBefore the test begins, the nurse helps you lie on an exam table on your left side. Medicine to relax you is injected into the IV. Once the medicine starts working, the doctor slowly inserts the colonoscope in your rectum to the large intestine. Pictures of the lining of the colon can be seen on a TV monitor.If polyps or abnormal tissue are noted, a biopsy may be done. A thin wire or looped device is inserted into the colonoscope to remove a tissue sample or the entire polyp. (This is not painful.) If bleeding is found in the colon, a small laser probe or medicine can be used to stop the bleeding.During the exam, you may feel bloating. This is due to the air used to expand the folds of the colon for easier viewing. You may also have some cramps as the colonoscope moves through the curves of the large intestine. Medicine is given through the IV to relieve this discomfort and to relax you. Your blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate and oxygen level will be checked often.After the ExamThe nurse will check on you often for at least 1 hour after the exam while the medicine wears off. The nurse will ask you to lie on your left side to allow you to pass gas. This also helps relieve any cramping and bloating. Due to the limited space, there is no visiting in the recovery area. Please let us know about any special visiting needs.The medicine given during the test affects your judgment and reflexes. You may feel groggy. Do not drive or operate machinery until the next day. You must have a responsible adult accompany you home, or the test will be rescheduled.Unless you are otherwise instructed, you may resume your diet and routine medicine after you leave the GI Lab. You also will be given written guidelines before you leave.Test ResultsThe doctor or nurse will discuss the exam results with you or your family on the day of the test. A follow-up doctor's visit to go over your exam and biopsy results may be needed. Biopsy results are usually ready 5 to 7 days after your test. 3When to Call the DoctorAfter the exam, you may notice a small amount of blood in your bowel movements. This is normal. However, contact your doctor if you have: Severe abdominal pain. A fever above 100.5 F. Chills. Significant rectal bleeding.If you have any questions about this test, please contact your doctor or the GI Clinic at 312-695-5620.Health Information ResourcesFor more information, visit Northwestern Memorial Hospital's Alberto Culver Health Learning Center.

PORTQAQCATH! Clinical!Trials!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Section!4:!Treatment!Regiment!! A port-a-cath (also called implanted port or \"port\") is a device inserted under the skin on your chest (or sometimes your upper arm). It has a small catheter or tubing attached which is placed into a large vein. When not in use, it will show only as a nickel sized bump underneath your skin. The port is placed by a doctor in the Interventional Radiology department. You will be given some medications to relax and the doctor will use local anesthesia (numbing medicine) where the port is inserted so you will be comfortable. The area may be tender for a few days after the port is placed. You must arrange for a ride home after the procedure as you will be too tired to drive. The nurse will use a special needle to access the port when it is needed and the needle will be removed when your treatment is completed. There are many advantages to having a port. It is a safe way to give chemotherapy that could irritate or damage your skin and tissues if it leaked outside of the vein. Some treatments require the patient to go home with a chemotherapy infusion pump and a port will make it easier for you to move about while getting treatment. A port can be used to draw blood as well as receive chemotherapy, IV fluids and other medicines so it will decrease the number of times you have to be \"stuck\" with a needle. Also a port is a good idea if you have tiny veins that are hard to find. The port will need to be flushed every month if it is not being used. You can make an appointment with our cancer center nurses to do this if needed. PORT-A-CATH What are clinical trials? A clinical trial is a research study with human volunteers that determines the effectiveness of an investigational cancer drug. Prior to its approval, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires a new drug to be tested in a clinical trial to determine its safety and effectiveness. Although today's FDA-approved cancer treatments are a result of clinical trials, not all clinical trials result in drug approvals. A non-FDA-approved drug is investigational and must undergo vigorous testing to ensure that it is safe and effective. A clinical trial is also known as a \"research study\", \"study\", or \"trial\". Why are clinical trials important? Clinical trials advance science and medicine to aid in the development of treatments that are more targeted, often with fewer side effects. Participation in clinical trials offers the potential for access to treatments that are not otherwise available. Results of clinical trials help to advance patient care, in addition to the advancement of scientific knowledge about cancer. How can I learn about a clinical trial? There are a few ways to learn about the clinical trials available at Northwestern: 1. By asking one of your oncology healthcare providers. 2. By website - http://cancer.northwestern.edu/clinicaltrials/index.cfm 3. By phone - (312) 695 - 1102 4. By email - cancertrials@northwestern.edu 5. Informed consent forms - documents that provide details about the trial, describe the risks vs. benefits, and the treatment schedule. After you decide to sign the consent form and take part in the trial, you have to right to withdraw from participation at any time. What are the clinical trial phases? Clinical trials are comprised of different phases that provide information about the drug. x Phase I trials test the safety of the new drug and determine how much of it should be given x Phase II trials test the new treatment to determine if it is effective. x Phase III trials compare the effectiveness of the new treatment against the standard drugs currently available to find out which one is better x Phase IV trials monitor ongoing safety and side effects When can I ask my healthcare team if a clinical trial is right for me? Anytime you are facing a treatment decision you should ask your healthcare providers if a clinical trial may be appropriate for you. Clinical trials are not just for advanced stage cancer - clinical trials are available for all stages of cancer. Clinical Trials the state of well -being that focuses on our feelings about our own sexuality, and may include the physical, emotional and cultural aspects of sexual well -being. What is sexuality? Sexuality may include : x Our bodies. x The act of sex. x Our sexual orientation. x Gender identity (male or female). x Our values about life, love and the people in our lives. Will my sexual desire change as I go through cancer treatments? You may notice a change in your sexual desire during cancer treatment. This may be due to: x Pain. x Fatigue. x Changes in hormones. x Depression and anxiety. x Changes in your self -image. How can I express intimacy without sexual intercourse? Love and affection can be expressed in many ways. x Kissing. x Hugging. x Fondling. x Cuddling. x Touching. x Holding hands What should I do if I want to have sex with my spouse/partner? Talk to your doctor or nurse to see if it is all right to engage in sexual acts during active cancer treatment. Questio ns to ask your doctor or nurse during cancer treatment: x When can I have sex? x What can I expect? x What can I do to protect myself and my partner during sex? x Are there any restrictions on sexual activity during or after treatment? Sexual Health and Cancer Precautions during sexual activity: x Use a barrier contraceptive, such as condoms. This prevents exchange of body fluids. During cancer treatment, semen and vaginal fluids may contain chemotherapy byproducts. Barrier methods also help prevent the spread of STDs (sexually transmitte d diseases). x Use 2 forms of protection to prevent pregnancy. Chemotherapy may affect male semen and female eggs. Medicines you are taking may be harmful to a developing fetus. Talk to your doctor or nurse about birth control methods (e.g., condoms, spermic ide, diaphragms and cervical caps). x Before having intercourse, your neutrophil count should be over 2,000 cells/mm3. If your counts are lower than this, talk to your doctor or nurse. A low neutrophil count increases your risk for infection. When your white blood cell count is very low, the pressure of sex may cause bacteria from the vagina or rectal areas to get into the bloodstream. You may get sick if this happens. To help prevent this from occurring, it is recommended that you wash your genitals before a nd after sex. x Before having intercourse, your platelet count should be above 50,000 cells/mm3. When your platelet count is low, you have a greater risk for bleeding. x To promote hygiene during sexual acts: Wash hands before and after sexual activity . x Avoid rectal intercourse, which can increase your risk of infection and risk of bleeding. x Avoid excessive friction during intercourse by using a water -based lubricant, such as K -Y Jelly\u00ae or Astroglide\u00ae. Do not use petroleum -based jellies or lubricants. x Repo rt any unusual pain, fever, bleeding or discharge to your doctor or nurse. Important signs and symptoms to report to your doctor or nurse: x Changes in sexual drive. x Men: Genital pain, pain during erection and/or ejaculation or problems having an erection. x Women: Dryness in the vagina, unusual discharge from your vagina, hot flashes, pain during sex, discomfort, bleeding during or after intercourse. Tips to promote sexual health: x Be responsible. x Get professional help when needed. x Talk with your healthcare provider. x Talk to your partner about your feelings. x Take time for intimacy other than intercourse. x Keep an open mind about ways to feel sexual pleasure. x Focus on your physical recovery first. It's OK not to have sex. Health Information Resources For more information, visit Northwestern Memorial Hospital's Alberto Culver Health Learning Center.

A Voice in Your Future: Your Health, Your Decision At Northwestern Memorial Hospital, we honor your right to make your healthcare wishes known. The Illinois Power of Attorney for Healthcare was created so that you have a voice in your medical treatment even if you are unable to speak for yourself. The law allows you to complete a Power of Attorney for Healthcare to designate someone to make healthcare decisions if you cannot. For any of us, the time may come when an accident or illness leaves us temporarily unconscious or otherwise unable to make decisions. The time may come when no medical treatment will restore our physical health. Because this can happen to anyone, we encourage everyone to designate a decision maker. It is easy to complete a Power of Attorney for Healthcare: There is no cost. You do not need a lawyer. You can prepare it at home or at the hospital. The Power of Attorney for Healthcare allows you to name a person to act as your \"agent\" to make decisions on your behalf when you cannot do so. Your Agent Acts for You Only When You Cannot Make Your Own Decisions. You can appoint any adult as your agent, except a healthcare provider involved in your care. Most people appoint a trusted family member or friend. Before you appoint an agent, we recommend that you ask the person if they are willing to make decisions on your behalf and make certain they understand your wishes about the kind of medical treatment you want. You can have only one agent, but it is a good idea to list \"successor\" agents in case the rst person you choose is unavailable.The agent's role is to make healthcare decisions for you. You may give your agent all the powers that you would normally have and the power to consent to, or refuse, any type of healthcare. You can place limitations on your agent's power or can give your agent specic rules to follow. If you have registered to be an organ donor in Illinois (donatelifeillinois.org), your agent does not have to make this decision. If you have not registered, your agent would have to make that decision.The standard form of the Power of Attorney for Healthcare contains blanks for you to ll in, if you choose, with instructions for your agent. It also contains three statements about life-sustaining treatment. You can select the statement that is closest to your own intentions or you can write your own. If you decide to write your own, we recommend you discuss it with your physician to be sure that it reflects your own medical situation. Facts About the Power of Attorney for Healthcare You may use a standard form or you may write your own. The form does not need to be prepared by a lawyer. The form does not need to be signed by a physician. However, we encourage you to discuss your thoughts and preferences with your physician to make sure that your form reflects the choices you want. The form is free and you can nd it at www.nmh.org/nm/hospital-guide-advance-directives, in our Health Learning Center, on the State of Illinois website at idph.state.il.us/public/books/advin.htm or by asking a chaplain, social worker or patient representative at Northwestern Memorial. If you used a form from another state that meets the Illinois legal requirements, we will honor it. How Do I Prepare a Power of Attorney for Healthcare?While you are a patient, the hospital staff can assist you in completing the Power of Attorney for Healthcare. In the hospital's Health Learning Center, you can nd educational videos and other resources about advance directives.What Do I Do With the Power of Attorney for Healthcare When I Complete It?Give copies to your primary care physician, your hospital physician and close family members or friends. If you are admitted to the hospital, we will scan the documents into your electronic medical record so they are available to the clinical team. We encourage you to talk with your physicians, family and friends about how you want to be cared for if you can no longer speak for yourself. It is especially important to discuss the kind of treatment you would like to receive if you have a terminal condition or are unable to make your own decisions for an extended period of time. We also encourage you to talk to a trusted physician who knows you well as you think about these issues. Consider: Do you believe that sometimes the burden and pain of treatment might be greater than the benet? Do you have special concerns or questions about articial ventilation, tube feedings or other kinds of treatment administered when you are terminally ill? Do you have any special concerns about pain or comfort care? Your physicians and nurses will always provide pain management and comfort care along with other care and treatment according to your needs and preferences.If you complete a Power of Attorney for Healthcare and later change your mind, you can revoke the document by tearing it up or stating that it is being revoked. Each time you are admitted to the hospital, we will ask you if we have the most current copy.Other Advance DirectivesThere are other forms of advance directives that some patients may wish to use. The Do Not Resuscitate (DNR) order is helpful to patients nearing the end of life who do not want any attempts made at CPR (cardiopulmonary resuscitation), including shocks attempting to restore heartbeat and support of breathing by a tube placed in the windpipe and attached to a breathing machine (ventilator). While you are in the hospital, your physician can enter an order so that CPR is not attempted. Patients with a DNR order may still receive the full range of other necessary medical treatment, including pain management and comfort care, medication, therapy, dialysis and sometimes even surgery. If you want to have this order available even when you are at home, the State of Illinois has a form you may use at idph.state.il.us/public/books/advin.htm or you can ask for it at the hospital. This order must be signed by the patient and a physician. If you bring this order to the hospital, it will be honored. If you would like to prepare one before you go home from the hospital, we will assist you. A Mental Health Treatment Preference Declaration lets you say whether you consent to receive electroconvulsive treatment, psychotropic medicine or admission to a mental health facility when you have a mental illness. You may name someone to make decisions about mental health treatment if you are incapable. A form is available at idph.state.il.us/public/books/advin.htm.If You Do Not Specify a Decision MakerIf you decide not to designate an agent and if you cannot make your own decisions, under Illinois law, a limited range of healthcare decisions will be made by your legal \"surrogate,\" in this order of priority:1. Court-appointed guardian (if any)2. Spouse3. Adult child4. Parent5. or sister 6. Adult grandchild7. Close friend8. Court-appointed guardian of the estateIf more than one family member is in the same category, the majority must make the decision. For example, if there are three adult children, at least two must agree. In making healthcare decisions, the family members or friends must try to come to the same decision that the patient would have. However, a surrogate under Illinois law does not have the same authority or decision-making power that an agent has under the Power of Attorney for Healthcare.We recommend that everyone complete a Power of Attorney for Healthcare to be sure that your wishes will be followed.Hospital ResourcesWe encourage you to discuss any questions about your care and treatment with your personal physician and the other physicians, nurses and caregivers who care for you during your hospital stay.

Published by the Department of Communications, Northwestern Memorial HealthCare 4449-13Dear Patient,In this packet you will find a copy of the official State of Illinois \"POWER OF ATTORNEY FOR HEALTH CARE.\"We invite all patients to complete this form, so that you can tell us who can speak for you if there is ever a time when you cannot speak for yourself.When you complete this form, you are choosing one person who will have all the same power you would have to make decisions for yourself, if there is ever a time when you cannot make them.If you don't use a Power of Attorney document, then Illinois state law determines who can speak for you as your \"surrogate.\" However, a health care surrogate's power to make decisions may be very limited in certain situations. For example, a health care surrogate cannot tell your health care providers to withdraw or withhold life-sustaining treatment unless you have certain \"qualifying conditions.\" You may want these limits, or you may not.If you want to be specific in choosing who will make decisions for you, and what limits there should be on those decisions, then the Power of Attorney for Health Care is the best way to make your wishes known.Hospital staff are available to help you complete this form if you wish. Please ask your nurse to contact a chaplain, social worker, or patient representative. We encourage you to discuss this subject with your doctor and your family as well. A witness to your signature is required by law. Information on who may and may not serve as a witness to your signature is found at the end of the Power of Attorney document.We will store this document with your medical record. However, we will ask you for the document at each visit or admission, because it is important for your care that we have the most recent one readily accessible. Please bring it every time you come to NM for care.Thank you for taking time to plan so that you receive the care that is right for you. 504358 (2/15)ILLINOIS STATUTORY SHORT FORM POWER OF ATTORNEY FOR HEALTH CARENOTICE TO THE INDIVIDUAL SIGNINGTHE POWER OF ATTORNEY FOR HEALTH CARENo one can predict when a serious illness or accident might occur. When it does, you may need someone else to speak or make health care decisions for you. If you plan now, you can increase the chances that the medical treatment you get will be the treatment you want.In Illinois, you can choose someone to be your \"health care agent.\" Your agent is the person you trust to make health care decisions for you if you are unable or do not want to make them yourself. These decisions should be based on your personal values and wishes.It is important to put your choice of agent in writing. The written form is often called an \"advance directive.\" You may use this form or another form, as long as it meets the legal requirements of Illinois. There are many written and on-line resources to guide you and your loved ones in having a conversation about these issues. You may find it helpful to look at these resources while thinking about and discussing your advance directive.WHAT ARE THE THINGS I WANT MY HEALTH CARE AGENT TO KNOW?The selection of your agent should be considered carefully, as your agent will have the ultimate decision-making authority once this document goes into effect, in most instances after you are no longer able to make your own decisions. While the goal is for your agent to make decisions in keeping with your preferences and in the majority of circumstances that is what happens, please know that the law does allow your agent to make decisions to direct or refuse health care interventions or withdraw treatment. Your agent will need to think about conversations you have had, your personality, and how you handled important health care issues in the past. Therefore, it is important to talk with your agent and your family about such things as: (i) What is most important to you in your life? (ii) How important is it to you to avoid pain and suffering? (iii) If you had to choose, is it more important to you to live as long as possible, or to avoid prolonged suffering or disability? (iv) Would you rather be at home or in a hospital for the last days or weeks of your life? (v) Do you have religious, spiritual, or cultural beliefs that you want your agent and others to consider? (vi) Do you wish to make a significant contribution to medical science after your death through organ or whole body donation? (vii) Do you have an existing advance directive, such as a living will, that contains your specific wishes about health care that is only delaying your death? If you have another advance directive, make sure to discuss with your agent the directive and the treatment decisions contained within that outline your preferences. Make sure that your agent agrees to honor the wishes expressed in your advance directive.Illinois Statutory Short Form Power of Attorney for Health Care (continued)504358 (2/15)WHAT KIND OF DECISIONS CAN MY AGENT MAKE?If there is ever a period of time when your physician determines that you cannot make your own health care decisions, or if you do not want to make your own decisions, some of the decisions your agent could make are to: (i) Talk with physicians and other health care providers about your condition. (ii) See medical records and approve who else can see them. (iii) Give permission for medical tests, medicines, surgery, or other treatments. (iv) Choose where you receive care and which physicians and others provide it. (v) Decide to accept, withdraw, or decline treatments designed to keep you alive if you are near death or not likely to recover. You may choose to include guidelines and/or restrictions to your agent's authority. (vi) Agree or decline to donate your organs or your whole body if you have not already made this decision yourself. This could include donation for transplant, research, and/or education. You should let your agent know whether you are registered as a donor in the First Person Consent registry maintained by the Illinois Secretary of State or whether you have agreed to donate your whole body for medical research and/or education. (vii) Decide what to do with your remains after you have died, if you have not already made plans. (viii) Talk with your other loved ones to help come to a decision (but your designated agent will have the final say over your other loved ones).Your agent is not automatically responsible for your health care expenses.WHOM SHOULD I CHOOSE TO BE MY HEALTH CARE AGENT?You can pick a family member, but you do not have to. Your agent will have the responsibility to make medical treatment decisions, even if other people close to you might urge a different decision. The selection of your agent should be done carefully, as he or she will have ultimate decision-making authority for your treatment decisions once you are no longer able to voice your preferences. Choose a family member, friend, or other person who: (i) is at least 18 years old; (ii) knows you well; (iii) you trust to do what is best for you and is willing to carry out your wishes, even if he or she may not agree with your wishes; (iv) would be comfortable talking with and questioning your physicians and other health care providers; (v) would not be too upset to carry out your wishes if you became very sick; and (vi) can be there for you when you need it and is willing to accept this important role.

The second and third agents are called your successor agents and they function as back-up agents to your first choice agent and may act only one at a time and in the order you list them.WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF I DO NOT CHOOSE A HEALTH CARE AGENT?If you become unable to make your own health care decisions and have not named an agent in writing, your physician and other health care providers will ask a family member, friend, or guardian to make decisions for you. In Illinois, a law directs which of these individuals will be consulted. In that law, each of these individuals is called a \"surrogate.\"There are reasons why you may want to name an agent rather than rely on a surrogate: (i) The person or people listed by this law may not be who you would want to make decisions for you. (ii) Some family members or friends might not be able or willing to make decisions as you would want them to. (iii) Family members and friends may disagree with one another about the best decisions. (iv) Under some circumstances, a surrogate may not be able to make the same kinds of decisions that an agent can make.WHAT IF THERE IS NO ONE AVAILABLE WHOM I TRUST TO BE MY AGENT?In this situation, it is especially important to talk to your physician and other health care providers and create written guidance about what you want or do not want, in case you are ever critically ill and cannot express your own wishes. You can complete a living will. You can also write your wishes down and/or discuss them with your physician or other health care provider and ask him or her to write it down in your chart. You might also want to use written or online resources to guide you through this process.WHAT DO I DO WITH THIS FORM ONCE I COMPLETE IT?Follow these instructions after you have completed the form: (i) Sign the form in front of a witness. See the form for a list of who can and cannot witness it. (ii) Ask the witness to sign it, too. (iii) There is no need to have the form notarized. (iv) Give a copy to your agent and to each of your successor agents. (v) Give another copy to your physician. (vi) Take a copy with you when you go to the hospital.

If you do, tell someone who is at least 18 years old that you have changed your mind, and/or destroy your document and any copies. If you wish, fill out a new form and make sure everyone you gave the old form to has a copy of the new one, including, but not limited to, your agents and your physicians.WHAT IF I DO NOT WANT TO USE THIS FORM?In the event you do not want to use the Illinois statutory form provided here, any document you complete must be executed by you, designate an agent who is over 18 years of age and not prohibited from serving as your agent, and state the agent's powers, but it need not be witnessed or conform in any other respect to the statutory health care power.If you have questions about the use of any form, you may want to consult your physician, other health care provider, and/or an attorney.
