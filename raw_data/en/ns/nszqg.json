In animal studies, high fevers in early pregnancy have been associated with slight increase in risk of birth defects and pregnancy loss If this is concern, current recommendation is to take pregnancy - safe fever reducer (e.g. Tylenol) if fever after getting vaccinated If unde rgoing fertility treatments, current recommendation is to continue treatments and get vaccinated T alk with your physician and/or fertility specialists to make the decision that is best for you www.uchicagomedicine.org/forefront/coronavirus -disease -covid-19/mrna- covid-19-vaccine-pregnancy -breastfeedingCOVID Vaccines & Maternal Antibodies J AMA Peds: cohort study showed trans- placental transfer of maternal SARS -CoV-2 antibodies Ig G antibodies transferred across placenta after asymptomatic & symptomatic infection during pregnancy Ig M antibodies not detected in cord blood sera C ord blood antibody concentrations correlated with maternal antibody concentrations and with duration between onset of infection and delivery F indings demonstrate potential for maternally derived SARS -CoV-2 specific antibodies to provide neonatal protection from COVID -19 https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/2775945Breastfeeding & COVID Vaccines Risks A ny small amounts of mRNA or DNA from vaccines in body are quickly broken down I t is extremely unlikely that any vaccine material would be able to get into breast milk or into fetus through the placenta Ad ditionally, because this material is so easily degraded, it cannot survive acidic environment of baby's stomach even if it were ingested www.uchicagomedicine.org/forefront/coronavirus -disease -covid-19/mrna- covid-19-vaccine-pregnancy -breastfeedingChildren and COVID-19 Vaccines P fizer is available for older than 16 years M oderna and J and J are available for >18 yrs P fizer trial is fully enrolled for children 12 <16 yrs M oderna trial fully enrolled for children 12 <18 yrs Moderna has opened trials for 6 mo-12 years J & J has opened trials 12 -18 years and then will start trial for 6 mo -12 years 15State COVID Updates: Transportation Ma ine DHHS offering free transportation to anyone needing ride to vaccination appt I ndiv's must first schedule vaccine appt T hose with vaccine appt can schedule rides by calling tel. 1 -855-608-5172 (Mon -Sat, 7A -4P) N eed to call at least 48hrs before vaccine appt Ma naged by ModivCare (formerly LogistiCare), with contracts to CAPs & other agencies Driv ers will leave pts for appt, return at 60' or 90' 16State Sat-Sun: 8A - 2P Ca n help those who... -D o not have internet access -Need assistance connecting to or navigating online resources -R equire interpretation assistance -Ar e home bound and need transportation -H ave other questions about resources in their area Wi ll notprovide faster access to clinic appts 17ME DHHS Equity webinar Wed, April 21, 7:30A R egister in advance for this and additional webinars in monthly series: https://zoom.us/meeting/register/tJcsfuGvpj0jGda RiW5Y15qnYa2AMVriHgaI , OR L og on at the the webinar with following (7:30A) Fri (12N) each month 18Ensuring Racial/Ethnic Equity Phase 1a Health Care Personnel Residents & staff of long -term care facilities Public safety State COVID response critical personnelAll Other Current: 60 yo1 School teachers & staff, child care staff Then...
