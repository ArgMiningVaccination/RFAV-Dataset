Qi and the Yin-Yang Balance \u2014 TCM Theory The core belief of traditional Chinese medicine (, zhng y, /jong ee/) is about the yin-yang (, yny\u00e1ng) or qi balance in the body and its organs. There is no scientific evidence for the existence of qi. What Is \"Qi\" Believed to Be? It is believed that qi is life energy, and its flow in the body depends on the environment and what happens to the body. The balance of qi in the parts of the body depends on the flow of various kinds of qi and fluids. Injury, physical suffering, and lack of proper food causes a qi deficiency (q\u00ecx). Yin Qi and Yang Qi Most Chinese medicine practitioners think that there are many kinds of qi (q\u00ec), and the most basic kinds are yin qi and yang qi . Everything is a balance of yin and yang. Yin is female, dark and formless. Yang is male, light, and form. Females have more yin qi, and males have more yang qi, and as people age, they lose qi. Achieving a Yin-Yang Balance It is theorized that each person and part of the body has an ideal point of balance of yin and yang for optimal health. Some techniques are more appropriate for increasing yang qi, and some are appropriate for decreasing yang qi, and likewise for yin qi. The core idea of Chinese medicine is that people can increase or decrease the various qis in the body, and its parts, by various medical techniques, to create a healthful yin-yang balance. How TCM Balances Qi for Better Health It is believed that qi deficiencies (i.e. poor health) in a person or a body part can be corrected by eating proper food, taking herbs and medicines, using physical manipulation such as cupping, moxibustion, acupuncture and massage, or doing meditation and physical exercise such as qigong. How to Replace Qi For example, if a woman is sick or weak from a lack of yin qi, she can eat foods high in yin qi such as melons or goji berries or various high yin herbs. Older men may want to take herbal and food remedies, such as drinking ginseng tea or eating seahorse dishes, because they are high in yang content, or get a moxibustion treatment that adds Yang to the body. How to Improve Qi Circulation If, due to injury or stress, the qi circulation gets blocked or stagnated, all the above medical techniques can be used to unblock the qi channels called meridians, or increase or decrease the qi in various locations. However, a medical practitioner should help you decide which procedure will best help to cure your condition. Qigong and tai chi practitioners think that special exercises and meditation helps the qi in the body to circulate. They think that by practicing, they can learn to control the motion of qi, and use the qi to heal injured body parts, cure diseases, get healthier, defend themselves, and live longer.
