An increasing number of those jobs will require people with bachelor's and graduate degrees. Some allied health care providers work collaboratively with other providers, including physicians, nurses, dentists and pharmacists. They may play roles in evaluating and assessing a patient's needs, keeping the physician and others informed of the patient's progress and caring for the patient. Others work independently as specialists in exercise, nutrition, health education, speech and daily function.

Technicians are trained to perform procedures, and their education lasts less than two years. They are required to work under the supervision of technologists or therapists. Cardiovascular technicians, ophthalmic medical technicians and medical assistants are examples of careers in this category. The educational process for therapists or technologists is more intensive and includes acquiring procedural skills.

Educational curricula teach students to evaluate patients' responses to therapy and make appropriate decisions about continued treatment or modification of treatment plans.
