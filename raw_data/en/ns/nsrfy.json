Sep. 2023Observational learning for narrative writing in elementary school Text quality and self-efficacy in students with normal hearing and students with hearing loss EMILY GRENNER FACULTY OF MEDICINE | LUND UNIVERSITY Department of Clinical Sciences, Lund Logopedics, Phoniatrics and Audiology Lund University, Faculty of ryck, Lund 2021 In this dissertation I describe the development and evaluation of an observational learning intervention for narrative writing and a corresponding self-efficacy scale. The intervention was implemented in Swedish elementary school classes for students with normal hearing in Grade 5 (n=55) and for students with hearing loss in Grades 5-8 (n=11). The self- efficacy scale was implemented in classes for students with normal hearing in Grade 5. The students wrote personal narratives and the students with normal hearing filled out a self-efficacy scale. Verbal working memory capacity, language comprehension and reading comprehension were measured. For students with hearing loss, audiological data was collected. The dissertation demonstrates that observational learning may complement other structured writing interventions supporting young writers.

They should therefor e be trained early and developed throughout school with effective methods. Aim: This dissertation aimed at dev eloping and evaluating an observa tional learning intervention and a self- efficacy scale for supporting narrative writing in elementary s chool students wit h normal hearing (NH) and with hearing loss (HL). The interventio n and the scale were develope d for possible use in a Swedish school context. Method: A five-lesson observational lear ning intervention and a self-ef ficacy scale were developed. Grade 5 students with NH (n=55) and st udents with HL in Grades 5-8 (n=1 1) wrote four narrative texts which were rated holistically. Students with NH filled out a self-efficacy scale twice. Verbal working memory capacity (WM), language (sentence) comprehension and reading comprehension wer e measured. Audiological data was collected for students with HL. Results: An observational learning intervention for writing and a corres ponding self-efficacy scale could be developed and used in the classroom, in line with the Swedish c urriculum. Mixed effect s regression analysis showed a positive intervention effect on text quality ratings f or students with NH . The effect was not sustained at follow-up. Higher WM scores were associated with higher text qu ality ratings (NH). Higher scores on the reading comprehension test were associated with stronger intervention e ffects (NH). For student s with HL, there were no significant text quality changes . Cognitive and linguistic fact ors had no overall effects (HL). The students with HL with the highest text quality ra tings were amplified earlier than students with the lowest te xt quality ratings. Female gender was associated with higher text quality ratings (NH and HL). Repeated measures ANOVA showed that self-efficacy for writing increased significantly after the int ervention (NH). Students wit h high text quality ratings had strong self-efficacy (NH). Boys and girls had similar self-efficacy (NH). Conclusion: Observational learning could be implemented in Swedish schools and may complement other structured writing intervention s. The reinforcement of new skil ls may be important for sus tained effects, especially for students with poorer language s kills. Despite girls' higher text quality ratings, boys w ith NH had similar self- efficacy to girls with NH. Writing motivation may increase by o bserving and identifying w ith models. The higher text quality in students who were diagnosed with HL earlier underlin e the importance of early diagnosis of HL for optimal audiological, linguistic and pedagogical support. Adapt ing, evidence-basing and implementing new teaching practices as well as evidence-basing current methods i s important in improving the teaching of writing and strengthening language outcomes. The continuous support of students' writing development is a question of facilitating their academic achievement in school and their par ticipation in and contribution to a sustainable society.

Early diagnosis and early rehabilitation are important for language development. Intervention should be further developed for students with HL before evaluation and implementation. Increased self-efficacy for writing was a possible positive effect of the observational learning intervention. Results support previous findings of strong self-efficac y at this age. 17 Preface Once upon a time, before joining this research project, I was w orking as a school speech-language pathologist (SLP), meeting students with langua ge disorders (LD), which sometimes co-exist with hear ing loss or other factors whi ch can affect language development. Working with those students and collabora ting with their teachers and other school personnel has given me a valuable per spective on this research. Since I started out as a school SLP over ten years ag o, school SLPs have become somewhat more common. Hop efully that trend will continue , developing effective collaboration between t eachers, SLPs and other profes sionals in the schools, as students with LD need considerable support and time for their language, reading and writing development. In this dissertation I describe th e development and evaluation of a narrative writing intervention by observational learning in two settings: mainstr eam school classes with a full range of students in Grade 5 and school classes exclusively for students with hearing loss in Grades 5-8. This dissertation may be relev ant for school SLPs and teachers, both those who are working in settings with stude nts with hearing loss and those who are working in full range/mainstream school class es. I hope I will be able to continue working with writing intervention in different age groups and settings. The dissertation is part of a project investigating observation al learning and keystroke logging in school settings. It was financed by the Ma rcus and Amalia Wallenberg Foundation, Grant 2012.0038, and by the Faculty of M edicine, Lund University, Sweden. 19 Introduction Writing skills are crucial in our s ociety. We write in our soci al life, at work, almost regardless of line of work, and at school, regardless of school subject (Rijlaarsdam et al., 2005; Skolverket, 2019a). All students need support in developing writing throughout their education, as writing requires a complex inter action of language skills (Beard et al., 2009). Written communication is expected for expressing and exploring knowledge and views t hroughout school, not only in th e traditional language subjects (Skolverket, 2019a). Students also often writ e to communicate with classmates and teachers. The acquisition of adequate writi ng skills is thus a democratic right, meaning that writing skills should be trained early and developed throughout school with effective methods. Writing instruction i s, however, often too scarce to give students the skills they need (e.g. Brindle et a l., 2016; Gilbert & Graham, 2010). In the age group of the students in this dissert ation, 10-16 years, writing development has not been studied as extensively as youn g children's writing and writing in older students (Myhill, 2009b). Students who are at risk of language and listening difficulties , for example students with hearing loss (HL), need particular support in developing a dequate writing skills. Students with HL represen t a heterogene ous group as for language skills and many meet the linguistic criteri a for developmental language di sorder (DLD) (Geers et al., 2016; Hansson et al., 2017; Sahl\u00e9n et al., 2018). Langu age difficulties with no known biomedical aetiology, which create obstacles to commun ication in everyday life and are expected t o continue over time are diagno sed as DLD (Bishop et al., 2017). An LD is diagnosed when the communicative criter ia for DLD are met and there is a possible aetiologic cause of the disorder, for e xample 'LD associated with HL' (Bishop et al., 2017). Many students with HL fall behi nd peers with normal hearing (NH) in basic language domains such as phonology (Sundstr\u00f6m et al., 2018), grammar and lexicon. T he development of the complex language skills essential in school, for example narration, conversation, liste ning and reading comprehension and writin g is therefore often delayed (Geers et al., 2016; Sandgren et al., 2015). The evidence base for effective writing instruct ion for students with HL is weak (Roos & Allard, 2016; Strassman & Schirmer, 2012). Narration or storytelling is at th e heart of humankind (Brown, 2013). It requires the cognitive abilities to grasp the concept of past, present and t he future. We use spoken or written narratives or stories to carry and create our belief s and history, our knowledge of the current world, and what we think the future ho lds. The (written) 20 narrative genre is considered a prerequisite for other genres, for example the expository and argumentative genres. Lastly, narrative skills h ave been found to predict academic achievement (Catts et al., 2003; Feagans & App elbaum, 1986; Griffin et al., 2004). In the present dissertation, the writing instruction method observational learning and its effects on writing performance are in focus. During observational learning, the students observe other writers, in the present case peers, during their writing activities. The students observe, reflect on and learn about text creation separated in time from writing, setting the method apa rt from traditional writing exercises where an instruction on some aspect of writin g is directly followed by writing according to the instruction. This may alleviate the cognitive load (Braaksma et al., 2002). Evidence of positive effects of observ ational learning on writing performance and on self-efficacy for writing is accumul a t i n g , o f t e n i n studies with participants in high school or at undergraduate le vels who write in expository or argumentative genres (Bouwer et al., 2017; Braaks al., et al., 2004; Raedts et al., 2007; Rijlaarsdam e t al., 2008). Observational learning studies in similar age-groups to the par ticipants with NH in the present dissertation are few and studies targeting students with HL are fewer (but see van de Weijer et al., 2018, for a study on university students with HL). To the knowledge of the author, there were no published studies of observational learning for narrative writing in Swedish schools prior to the studies in this dissertation, nor were there any Swedish studies of observation al learning for 12- 16-year-old students with H L. Writing is cognitively demanding an d for example working memory (WM) plays a crucial role in it (Hayes & Berninger, 2014; Kellogg et al., 20 13; McCutchen, 2000). As Graham and Harris write, \"having to switch attention while w riting to a mechanical demand such as figuring out how to spell a word, may lead a writer to forget ideas or plans held in working memory, influencing sentence construction, how much they write, and the qua lity of their text\" (Graham & H arris, 2014, p. 94). Dealing simultaneously with low-level processes such as transcr iption and spelling and high-level processes such as planning and reading through a t e x t , i s t a x i n g . Many students, particularly those with weak language skills, mu st spend considerable resources on low-level processes of writing, which leaves less resources for higher order processes like organization of the t ext (Berninger & Swanson, 1994). The separation of learning from writing in obse rvational learning may thus be beneficial. Another possible benefit of the observa tional learning paradigm is that observing peers performing a task is considere d highly motivating (Raedts et al., 2017). Self-efficacy is defined as a person's b eliefs about their ability to perform a task (Bandura, 1997). It is linked to motivation and may thus influence how well the task is performed, as a slight overestimation of c apability will lead to trying harder on a particular task, according to Bandura (1997) . The following paragraphs introduce an overview of language and early literacy development, writing development, writing instruction and the Swedish school 21 setting and curriculum. Thereafter, children with HL and their specific educational challenges and needs in language and writing are described. Las tly, the paradigms of observational learning and self-efficacy are described. Language and literacy develo pment in children with normal hearing Language development is highly de pendent on social context - so cial, perceptual, motor and cognitive skills being essential (Paul et al., 2018). Hearing is developed in the 23rd week of pregnancy and sensitivity to sound improves the follow ing weeks (J. Grenner, 2017) . Infants react more to speech (especially c hild-directed speech) than to other sound signals (Lage rcrantz, 2017). Typically chil dren's first words are interjected in their babbling at around 12-15 months and at thi s time they can already understand the meaning of many words as well as prosodic and sy ntactic elements of the language (languages) they hear (Paul et al., 2018). By a ge two, the spoken vocabulary may contain severa l hundred words (E. Clark, 2016, p . 87). At three years old, basic syntax is established in expressive language, and at four years old, phonological development has usually reached a level where the child's speech can be understood without contextual cues (Paul et al., 2018). Phon ological awareness, for example the ability to identify phonemes in words and rhyme s, continue to develop during the preschool years alongside early literacy dev elopment, for example recognizing the initial le tter of one's name, understan ding phoneme- grapheme mapping and reading direction (Runnion & Gray, 2019). At age six, when Swedish children start compulsory school, a child often underst ands around 14, 000 words (E. Clark, 2016, p. 87). Socio-economic factors, for exam ple school district, impact the amount of words and complexity of language which chi ldren hear (Neuman et al., 2018). Language comprehension is crucial for continuing language devel opment, reading comprehension (Gough & Boerma, 2016; Reuterski\u00f6ld et al., 2011). Po or language comprehension on the other hand is a predictor of DLD (e.g. Bis hop et al., 2016), and children with language delay at 2.5 years often have oral n arrative difficulties at 7-8 years (Miniscalco et al., 2007). Young children's retelling of narratives occur first in \"heaps\" of information without clear structure, then with increasing cohesion of sequences and settings (Applebee, 1978). Already at six years old, children's retelling of narrat ives has developed into the schema of true narratives cont aining a beginning, an action and a resolution (Karmiloff-Smith, 1981). By the end of preschool, the spoken na rrative genre has thus become well established in spoken language (Berman & Slobi n, 1994; Nordqvist Palviainen, 2001; Westby & Culatta, 2016). Children's spoken narrative 22 skills have turned out to predict reading during school as well as academic achievement (Applebee, 1978; Catts et al., 2002; Feagans & Appe lbaum, 1986). Further, reading comprehension h as repeatedly been linked to wo rking memory (Carretti et al., 2009) and to academic achievement (Swanson & Alloway, 2012; Titz & Karbach, 2014). The Swedish preschool curriculu m stresses children's language a nd literacy development (Skolverket, 2018), underscoring the importance of supporting narrative development from an early age. Preschool curriculum g oals include letting children listen to narratives and other types of texts, discuss ing and interpreting them, supporting children's lexical development, and supporting children's interest in different modes of communication (Skolverket, 2018). Writing development during elementary school Writing requires many simultaneous processes which rely on basi c cognitive and linguistic prerequisites (Beard et al., 2009; Hayes & Berninger , 2014). The most cited cognitive model of writing was originally proposed by Hay es and Flower (1980) and has been developed further several times (e.g. Hayes , 1996; Hayes & Berninger, 2014). In the model, writing is described as consist ing of different cognitive processes during planning (generating ideas, organizing them and setting goals for the text), translating (putting the ideas into words and transcribing those words) and reviewing (by reading, evaluating and revising). During a writing task, the writer must keep the task itself, the reader and the topic in mind, recall earlier writing experiences and writing plans, while staying motivated. Focusing and shifting attention between tasks taxes limited cognitive resour ces. A combination of Hayes and Flower's cognitive mode l of writing and a model of WM was proposed by Kellogg (1996). In early elementary school or before, children become aware tha t a written text is not speech written down, but this awareness of the difference b etween spoken and written language may not yet be reflected in their own texts (M yhill, 2009a). The writer is preoccupied with low-level transcription skills, whic h include forming letters or finding them on the keyboard, orthography, spelling and punctuation (Beard et al., 2009; Myhill, 2009a). Low-level transcription sk ills may not be established until 11-12 years (Bern inger & Swanson, 1994; Fayol et al., 1999). As long as lower level writing skills, for example transcription a nd spelling, are not automatized, there is less capacity for more complex writing ac tivities influencing text quality such as planning, sen tence generation and reviewin g (Arf\u00e9 et al., 2014; Drijbooms et al., 2015; McCutchen, 2000). With advancing age, c hildren's writing takes on more of the lexical and grammatical features which set it apart from spoken language (Myhill, 2009b). Written narratives develop further du ring elementary 23 school. During these years, writing is characterized by a linea r structure, meaning that the writer seldom changes earlier parts of the text after writing later parts of it, and that revision generally focuses on local editing and spelli ng (Johansson, 2009; Limpo et al., 2014). Berninger and colleagues showed that stude nts up to age 9 seldom revised their texts except for word for word, but from 9 -11, more planning and revising occurred even after writing a portion of a text (B erninger et al., 1994; Berninger et al., 1996; Berninger et al., 1992). These skills w ere not fully developed until 12-15 years (Berninger et al., 1994; Berninger et al., 19 96; Berninger et al., 1992). At 14-16 years, many students have reader awareness and thus revise their texts to suit the reader (Myhill & Jones, 2007). Lexical and sy ntactic development during these school years are influenced by children's reading skills, social context and general development (Myhill, 2009b). As the writer becomes more proficient, more aspects of the developing t ext are added to the task. Thus , an older student may make the same effort as a younger one, while producing a te xt of higher quality, as the freed cognitive capacities due to automatized lower leve l processing are replaced with, for example, genre awareness and reader awarenes s (McCutchen, 2000). In a study of Swedish groups of students who were 10, 13 , 17 years old, and of adults at university, 10- and 13- year-olds showed linearity in their narrative writing, while the older age groups would also revise texts not only directly after writing a word (revision on a local level) but by going back fu rther (global revision), to a greater extent (Johansson, 2009). Narrative writing was fo und to be highly influenced by spoken narrative skills during elementary school, while the written narratives began to influence s poken language in older students (Johansson, 2009). Some studies on writing and narra tive development in elementary school report gender differences (Kanaris, 1999; Myhill, 2008). Girls have be en found to write longer, more elaborated and more complex narratives (Kanaris, 1 999). Other studies find no gender differences (Johan sson, 2009). In the curriculum for the compulsory school, writing and reading narrative texts are two of the cent ral objectives for Grades 1-3 (ages 7-9) (Skolverket, 2019a). Effective writing instruction Writing instruction for elementary school students has been eva luated in several meta-analyses, for example (Grah am & Harris, 2018; Graham, Liu, et al., 2018; Graham et al., 2012; Koster et al., 2015). Instruction methods which have been found effective include modeling, peer assistance/collaboration and strategy instruction (Graham & Harris, 2018; Graham et al., 2012; Koster et al., 2015). Increasing students' motivation, for example by improving self- efficacy for writing, has also been found effective for improving text quality (Graha m & Harris, 2018). In strategy instruction, students may for example explicitly be taught how to plan and write a text in a specific genre, what structure certain te xts have and how to 24 write and revise texts (Graham & Harris, 2018). Another type of strategy instruction, included in one of the mentioned meta-analyses, is observation of a model who is using effective writing strategies (Fidalgo et al., 2015). See under Observational learning and Method development below for a more detailed descr iption. Strategy instruction has been found esp ecially effective for increased t ext quality and strengthened self-efficacy and motivation, when combined with s elf-regulating strategies of writing such as goal-setting and self-monitoring (Graham et al., 2012; Koster et al., 2015). The teaching of writing in Sweden The syllabi of Swedish teacher training programs have changed o ver time according to different school curricula (1980, 1994 and 2011) and have lo cal differences. Although prospective teachers are taught different theories on learning during teacher training, a socio-cultural perspective on learning has been influential in Swedish schools for a long tim e (Lundgren et al., 2017; Yassin Falk, 2017). From this perspective, learning devel ops through interaction with ot hers, such as peers and teachers, within a social context as a social activity (Vyg otsky, 1978; Yassin Falk, 2017). This affects the didactic methods which teachers a re familiar with. Neither teacher training nor the Swedish curriculum stipulates which methods should be used for teaching and developing writing (Skolverket, 2019a). Instead, personal and local experience ma ke a considerable influence on what students are taught. Around a decade ago, there was little focus in the curr iculum on teaching writing (Skolverket, 2020b). PISA c omparisons showed that Swedi sh students' literacy was declining during the first decade of this millenni um, especially reading comprehension (OECD, 2013). To r emedy this, a project for conti nued professional development (CPD) for teaching literacy (L\u00e4slyftet) led by the Swedish National Agency for Education was introduced in 2015 (Skolverket, 2020a) . Some modules of the CPD included writing but the main focus was on reading ( Roe & Tengberg, 2016). Since then, students' results on reading comprehension t asks have improved somewhat (OECD, 2016, 2019). Equity between students of differe nt socio- economic backgrounds has, however, declined (SOU, 2020) and con siderable differences in language and literacy skills in different school s districts are reported (Andersson et al., 2019). While mea sures are taken for improvin g Swedish students' literacy, effective methods for teaching writing suited to the Swedish school setting are still called for. While there is freedom of didactic choices and teaching methods , the goals stated in the Swedish curriculum are more explicit. The curriculum addres ses three school years at a time (Grades 1-3, 4-6, 7-9) and states the goals tha t students should reach in the subject of Swedish at the end of Grade 3 (10 years old), Grade 6 (13 years old), and Grade 9 (16 years old). For Grade 3, writing narrativ e texts is one central 25 objective of the curriculum (Skolverket, 2019a). Students at th e end of Grade 3 are expected to know about the organization of a narrative (introdu ction, sequence of events and ending) and descripti ons of literary figures. Studen ts at the end of Grade 6 should know about the structure and linguistic features of di fferent genres (e.g. descriptions, instructions, and argumentative texts), and shoul d have developed their narrative writing, understanding \"language features, stru cture and narrative perspectives in fiction for youth and adults\" as well as \"paral lel action, flashbacks, descriptions of settings and persons, internal and external dia logues\" (Skolverket, 2019a). Further, they should master syntactic and morphologic f eatures including main and subordinate clauses, parts of speech, morphology, spel ling rules, punctuation and cohesion (Skolverket, 2019a). They should know how to write by hand and on the computer. Furthe r, they are expected to know ho w to organize and revise their own texts and how to revise others' texts and how to give and receive feedback. Some methods used in Swedish schools include elements that are found in observational learning, for example strategy instruction, givin g feedback to peers' texts and collaborative learning (Skolverket, 2020a). Children with hearing loss There are around 5,000 children with HL who need audiological s ervices in the Swedish compulsory school for ages 6-16 (SOU, 2011:30). Most st udents with HL are \"mainstreamed\" in classes where most students have NH. In 2 016, 85 percent were mainstreamed and the estimate for the coming years was 95 percent (SOU 2016:46). Some students with HL who follow the general Swedish curriculum are enrolled in classes exclusively for students with HL (Skolverke t, 2019a). The students with HL in this dissertation belong to this group. Fur ther, a small number of students with profound HL attend special schools which mainl y use sign language (HL special school). Finally, there are special needs schools f or students with intellectual disability and other disabilities, including HL. S tudents with HL have poorer academic achievement than their NH peers (Rydberg et al. , 2009; SOU, 2016:46). Eighty-four percent of Swedish students with NH gradu ate from compulsory school eligible for high school (Skolverket, 2019b). In comparison, 78 percent of mainstreamed students with HL, 65 percent of student s in classes exclusively for students with HL, and 38 percent of students in HL special school graduate with grades that make them eligible for high school (S PSM, 2008). According to the Swedish National agency for special needs educ ation and schools (SPSM), the differences between school results for mainstreamed students with HL and students in classes exclusively for students with HL may in part depend on the fact that struggling students change schools, from mainstream c lasses to the exclusive classes (SPSM, 2008). Recent numbers have not been fo und, but 26 according to data from 2005, only ten to fifteen percent of stu dents with HL continued to tertiary education (HRF, 2007), while around sixty percent of all Swedish students do (SCB, 2015). More recent American data show a similar pattern. Eleven percent of adults with NH were enrolled in tert iary education, compared to five percent of adu lts with HL (Garberoglio et al., 2019). In Swedish classrooms for classes exclusively for students with HL there are often sufficient acoustic accommodations to improve listening conditi ons. The number of students is small, and classroom s are fitted with assistive lis tening devices. Aside from the time spent in the classroom however, much time is spen t in environments where the acoustic environment is not adapted to persons with H L, for example in extracurricular activities, commuting to school and the school- age educare (fritidshem). In mainstream classrooms, acoustics vary (Karjalainen et al., 2019; SOU, 2016:46). Noise impairs perception, even with w ell-fit amplification (Eisenberg et al., 2016). Thus, regardless of school placement and classroom accommodations, students with HL sp end much time in contexts wi th adverse listening conditions. Children with HL have more listening diff iculties in noise compared to peers with NH (Lewis et al., 2016; McFadden & Pittm an, 2008; Torkildsen et al., 2019). Amplifi cation and other acoustic acco mmodations are thus very important even for children with a HL classified as minima l or mild (Tomblin et al., 2015). The degraded speech signal caused by impaired pe rception of auditive input requires that students with HL must use more cognitive re sources for listening. Br\u00e4nnstr\u00f6m et al. (2018) found that nine-year-old students with NH listening in noise had poorer narrative compre hension than controls listenin g in quiet, which shows that students with NH also use more cognitive resources i n non-optimal listening conditions. What is lack ing in auditive input, the li stener must fill in by, for example, contextual and visual cues (R\u00f6nnberg et al., 2013) . Thus, in adverse listening conditions, fewer cognitive resources are available f or the task at hand (Mattys et al., 2012). Hearing loss is often measured with pure tone audiometry, i.e. the ability to detect tones in a quiet environment. T he best ear hearing level (BEHL) is the audiometric average of hearing thresholds (in dB) at 500, 1,000, 2,000 and 4,000 Hz. According to WHO, BEHL can be used as \"a useful summary of an individual' s hearing thresholds\" but does not determine how a person is affected by HL (WHO). For children, HL greater than 30 dB in the better hearing ear is co nsidered disabling, while the cutoff for disabling HL for adults is 40 dB (WHO). Ch ildren are thus considered more sensitive than a dults to HL. See Table 2 for an overview of degree of HL and corresponding BEHL. The degree of HL in the students in Paper II is classified according to J.G. Cla rk (1981), as this was the comm on classification when the students were diagnosed. Neither of these classificati on systems take unilateral HL into account, although a unilateral HL often make s listening difficult, especially in noise (Olusanya et al., 2019). Regardless of clas sification of HL, 27 hearing level and speech intelligibility with amplification in an ecologically valid setting is important for describing function, but it is not alw ays measured. Table 2. Degrees of hearing loss (HL) w ith corresponding better ear hear ing level in dB (BEHL) according to the current classification of WHO, 2019, and according to J.G. Clar k, 1981. Degree of HL WHO, 2019 Clark, 1981 Normal or minimal < 26 dB < 1 mild HL is considered disabling if >30 dB. Neonatal hearing screening has become implemented throughout Sw eden during the last two decades, but it was not in place when the participants of the study in the present dissertation were born. Late detection of HL still occu rs. Children with mild and moderate HL seldom receive l anguage assessment and interven tion in Sweden (Ros\u00e9n et al., 2019). Children with severe or profound HL usual ly receive more attention and intervention from audiological services. Those wh o receive a cochlear implant (CI) receive considerably more support than students wi th hearing aids (HA) (Ros\u00e9n et al., 2019) in Sweden. Hearing aids amplify sound in an ear with HL, while cochlear implants bypass the ear, delivering sound signal s directly to the auditory nerve (Gelfand, 2016). Those who have severe or profou nd HL may be eligible for CI surgery (Gelfand, 2016). There are no clear nat ional guidelines in Sweden on how, when and by whom the follow-up on language devel opment in children diagnosed with HL should be carried out. Language and literacy develo pment in children with hearing loss Many children with HL fall behind peers with NH, in basic langu age domains e.g. phonology, grammar and lexicon as well as in complex language a ctivities for example spoken and written narra tion, conversation, listening, reading and writing (Geers et al., 2016; Sandgren et al., 2015). Between twenty and fifty percent of pre- school children with HL meet criteria for language disorder (LD ) (Briscoe et al., 2001; Geers et al., 2009). The degree of HL is often not propor tional to language difficulties (Yoshinaga-Itano et al., 1998). Some studies show that even a minimal HL may lead to a considerable lag in language skills (Marschark & Knoors, 2012, 2018a; Tharpe, 2008). However, a recent study found that most students with mild or moderate HL caught up in language measures for example novel word reading and reading comprehension at 8 years, despite lagging behind in early literacy skills 28 at 5 years (Tomblin et al., 2020). The origin of language outco mes is multifactorial. The heterogeneity depends on the interaction of child-internal as well as external factors. Factors pertaining to the HL include degree of HL, eti ology, age at identification and diagnosis, age at amplification, type of amp lification and usage of it. Language skills such as grammar and vocabulary are bette r in children who use their HA consistently (Walker et al., 2015). Early exposure to sign language may also influence language skills including writing. For examp le, G\u00e4rdenfors and colleagues (2019) found that students with HL with early exposu re to sign language made fewer spelling mistakes than has been found in other stude n t s w i t h H L . Cognitive factors, for example WM, affect language skills (Arf\u00e9 et al., 2015; Sahl\u00e9n et al., 2018). For elementary school students with severe or pr ofound HL, verbal WM capacity was found to contribute more to text quality of pic ture-elicited, retold written narratives, than age or reading comprehension (Arf\u00e9 et al., 2015). Further, social and pedagogical factors, for example audiological and pe dagogical support, and SLP services for the family and in the preschool or school also affect language skills. In sum, there is an interplay of risk and resilience factors, where no single factor can explain language outcomes in students with HL. To end on a hopeful note, the pub lished data on academic achiev ement in the previous section and the data on language outcomes may not corr ectly mirror the current situation. Neonatal hearing screening increases the cha nce of early diagnosis and amplification. Earlier dia gnosis and amplification improve chances of language development on a par with hearing peers (Geers et al., 2016). Writing instruction for students with hearing loss Few well-controlled studies exist on effective writing instruct ion for students with HL. Implications for teaching are therefore inconclusive. Accor ding to a review of writing intervention for students with HL, \"the evidence for pr actice is at best promising\" & Schirmer, 2012, p.176). Recent studies by Dostal, Wolbers and colleagues have shown positive results from strateg ic and interactive writing intervention writing instruction (SIWI) (Dostal & Wolbe rs, 2016; Wolbers et al., 2018; Wolbers et al., 2015). It includes activation of previous knowledge, teacher modeling and thinking aloud, writing practice while the teacher gradually decreases support, and feedback (Dostal & Wolbers, 2016; Wolber s et al., 2018; Wolbers et al., 2015). In a Swedi sh overview of r eading and wri ting instruction for students with HL (Roos & Allard, 2016), the authors listed some possible success factors, based on the described problems and difficulties which these students have. 29 Observational learning A successful strategy in writing instruction is the observation of a model (Bouwer et al., 2017; Braaksma et al., 200 al., et al., 2015; Harris et al., 2006; Rijlaarsdam et al., 2008). The model may be a tea cher, or other \"mastery model\", showing students how to address an aspect of writing (H arris et al., 2006) or a peer with similar characteristics to the student of for ex ample similar age and skill (Fidalgo et al., 2008; Raedts et al., 2017). Observation o f a p e e r m a y b e especially motivating and may a ffect students' self-efficacy fo r writing (Raedts et al., 2017). When students are 'modeling' they try to emulate th eir actions and strategies and even thoughts and beliefs, to the model (Schunk, 2003). Students may identify more with a peer model than with a mastery model, whic h motivates them to try to perform the task in the same way as the peer does (Sc hunk, 2003). Observation should be seen as an active process; the observing student does not passively absorb the modeled be havior and imitate it (Bandura, 1997). The observer must make a series of decisions, i.e. focusing attention, reten tion for later use, gauging the effectiveness of the behavior, for example by ident ifying similarities to the model and then using the same techniques if deemed useful ( Bandura, 1997). Observational learning is thought to relieve cognitive load by separating the learning activities from the writing (Braaksma et al., 2012). Writing re quires much cognitive effort and may make following new instructions difficult while simultaneously juggling the many tasks which writing requires (Baker et al., 2 003; McCutchen, 2000). Observing and listening to a peer who verbalizes how the y complete a task while thinking aloud may make the observing student aware of wh at the model is doing, the observer thereby learning how to do the same thing n ext time they get a similar task (Braaksma et al., 2004). Thus, observation and ref lection on a model makes students re-evaluate how t hey write their texts, which ma y give insights in what to do - or not do - in the next writing task, i.e. they ha ve an opportunity of gaining metacognitive knowledge. Observation of peers for improving writing has been evaluated i n several studies with positive effects on text quality in expository and argumen tative texts in high school and college students (Bouwer et al., 2017; Braaksma et Rijlaarsdam et al., 2008; Zimmerman & Kitsantas, 2002). Some data show that similarity in skill between (peer) model an d observer may affect learning and self-efficacy - a coping model, i.e. overco ming difficulties during the observed task may lead to better skill and higher se lf-efficacy (Schunk et al., 1987). In a study on argumentative writing in 120 15-year-old students , Couzijn demonstrated that students who observed peers who were either w riting or both writing and reading had a better writing performance than stude nts who were doing writing exercises (1999). For a student to observe a peer readi ng and reacting to the 30 student's own text was also more effective than doing writing e xercises. A study on college students similarly showed that the observation of a mod el improved writing skills (in this case syntax) more than learning without a model (Zimmerman & Kitsantas, 2002). Further, the authors showed that observation of a \"coping\" model, i.e. one who struggled and learned gradually, was more effectiv e than observing a mastery model (Zimmerm an & Kitsantas, 2002). Self-efficacy The concept of self-efficacy, or a person's beliefs about their capabilities to perform a task, was introduced by Albert Bandura within the framework o f social cognitive theory (Bandura, 1977, 1986, 1997). When a person's self-effica cy is high, a difficult task will be viewed as an achievable challenge, motiv ating more effort. Slightly higher self-efficacy th an ability increases motivation , whereas low self- efficacy on the other hand leads to investing less in a task, i ncrease the risk of giving up, and thus reinforce lack of success (Bandura, 1997; Schunk, 2003). Bandura identified four sources influencing self-efficacy (1986 ) . T h e f i r s t i s enactive experience - remembering a prior, similar activity which was successful may affect self-efficacy positively, whereas a prior perceived failure may affect it negatively. The second source is vicarious experience - watching somebody perform a task may positively or negatively influence self-effi cacy depending on how the performer does. Observation of a peer is one form of vi carious experience. The third is social persuasion - encouragement or discouragement from a believable source influences self-efficacy. The fourth source is a person' s physiological and emotional state - feeling at ease may increase a person's self-efficacy while they may interpret anxiety as a l ack of capability or skill, (Bandur a, 1986). Self-efficacy affects motivation and learning in widely different fields for example health, sales and academia (see Schunk 1991 for an overview). It is affected by task demands and may vary widely between di fferent domains and skills and ev en between activities within a domain (Bandura, 1986, 1997). A valid self- efficacy scale should therefore measure self-efficacy in a domain-specific way (Bandu ra, 2006). In the academic setting, self-efficacy has been found an import ant predictor of motivation and learning in children (Pajares, 1996; Schunk, 199 4) as well as in adults (Richardson et al., 2012; Robbins et al., 2004). As an e xample, when comparing students from different math groups, strong self-effi cacy was linked to better performance within each group, whether that group consis ted of students with strong or weak performance (Coutinho & Neuman, 2008). Self-effi cacy for writing has also been linked to writing performance (Bulut, 2017; Calli nan 2007; Schunk & Swartz, 1993). Som e studies on writing self-efficacy and gender show that girls and boys report simila r self-efficacy, 31 although girls and boys think that girls' writing is better (Pajares & Valiante, 1999, 2001). Raedts and colleagues studied self-efficacy for writing in the observational learning context (2007, 2017). One study showed that observing models co uld increase self- efficacy directly (Raedts et al., 2007). Another showed that ob servation increased students' perceived value of the writing task, which in turn in creased their self- efficacy for writing (Raedts et al., 2017). Students' self-effi cacy for narrative writing has not been widely studied, especially in connection w ith writing intervention. Aspects of motiva tion such as self-efficacy may b e especially important for struggling students, due to the difficulties they experience during writing (Schunk, 2003). Self-efficacy changes over time. Young children often display s trong and holistic self-efficacy which is not yet differentiated between domains o r between aspects of a skill. It may comprise a general sense of skill, the perceive d effort on a task, and self-assessment (Stipek, 2002). During childhood and adolescenc e, self-efficacy decreases and becomes more differentiated (Muenks et al., 2018; Pajares, 2007). This decrease may have several reasons. One is transition betwe en schools, creating an unfamiliar environment (Schunk & Meece, 2006). Another is im proved calibration to skill from a previous overestimation or, in othe r words, a deeper understanding of the complexity of a skill (Muenks et al., 2018 ; Stipek, 2002). A third reason is that self-efficacy is linked to self-esteem, wh ich may decrease during adolescence. Further, motivation is not only affected by percei ved capability t o perform a task, but also by the perceived result of the effort and by the importance of the result to an individual (Geiger & Cooper, 1995). 33 Aim The overarching aim of the research presented in this dissertat ion is to develop and evaluate an intervention for supporting narrative writing in el ementary school students with NH and with HL and to develop and evaluate a self -efficacy scale for writing, which may be used in a Swedish school context. To meet this aim, four research questions are posed: 1) How can an observational learning intervention for writing a nd a corresponding self-efficacy scale be developed and implemented in Swedish elementary school classes for students with NH and HL, in line with the Swedish curriculum, students' school grade and age? 2) How does a five-lesson observational learning intervention a ffect holistic text quality after intervention and at follow-up in students wi th NH and in students with HL? 3) How are cognitive (WM capacity ) and linguistic (language com prehension and reading comprehension) factors and demographic factors (gen der and, in the case of students with HL, school grade and audiological fac tors) associated with text quality before and after intervention? 4) How does self-efficacy change after intervention in students with NH and how is it associated with text quality and gender? 34 To address these questions, an intervention using observational learning was developed and implemented in typical school classes and classes for students with HL. A self-efficacy scale was developed to measure self-efficac y in relation to intervention effects. Narrative writing skills were measured by text quality and intervention effects were studied in relation to self-efficacy, gender, cognitive and linguistic factors and, in the case of students with HL, school grade and audiological factors. The three studies (Pap ers I-III) each had more specifi c aims and questions, which are briefly described under Results. The first research question is mainly addressed in the chapter Method development. The second and third questions are addressed in Paper I for students with NH, and Paper II for students with HL. The fourth research question is addressed in Paper III.35 Method development This chapter describes the adaptation and development of observ ational learning intervention and self-efficacy measurement from the methods whi ch inspired the present research. It further describes the preparation of the f i l m s u s e d i n t h e intervention and lesson development. The last paragraph of the chapter briefly describes a small parallel study, n ot reported in the papers in this dissertation. Intervention design: Observatio n, reflection, and learning The research in the present dissertation was inspired by severa l Dutch studies on observational learning, for example Couzijn's comparative study of different observational learning conditions ( 1999), and the \"Yummy yummy case\", reported in Rijlaarsdam et al. (2008). Adapting the observational learni ng paradigm for the purpose of this dissertation led to three major differences in design. Firstly, the intervention was adapted to suit the Swedish curriculum and sch ool setting. An intervention series of five lessons would replace five other Sw edish lessons for the students, not interrupting the rest of the syllabus for the sem ester. Secondly, the intervention would target younger students. Thirdly, to suit th e younger students, the genre was changed to the na rrative rather than the argument ative genre which has been studied more thoroughly in observational learning (Rij laarsdam et al., 2008). A series of five 40-minute lessons was developed, where observa tion was based on peers filmed working with writing activities. An intervention i n that comparatively small scale would be possible to implement on a larger scale in Swedish schools if successful. It also made the data collection (aside from the fo llow-up) possible to fit within one semester. As the na rrative genre would be well-known to the students, they would build their new knowle dge on an already familiar gen re, consolidating and developing their knowledge. Lesson content A classroom intervention in three steps was developed. To make the lessons familiar to the students, each lesson followed the same pattern. The les son theme, for 36 example \"reader awareness\" was introduced. The five themes are listed below under Lesson content. The first step of the intervention was Observation , where the students would observe and listen to peers ('film peers') filme d working with writing activities. The second step was Reflection , where students would reflect individually and with classroom peers on what the film peers we re doing. Several examples were shown where film peers were performing a writing activity. After each observation of one or a few film clips, a structured refle ction with predefined questions would follow. The third and final step was Learning, where students would consolidate what they had learned by formulating it as ad vice for peers, i.e. \"for next year's students in this grade\". They would thereby re inforce what they found to be relevant to themselves and their peers. See Table 5 for examples of the advice which students wrote. Based on the curriculum for Grad es 4-6 (Skolverket, 2019a) and on writing activities suitable for observation, the intervention lessons w ere designed targeting the following areas: reader awareness, organization of events, conclusion and coda, revision of a written text, and online revision. Thus, high-lev el writing processes such as planning and organizing, as well as low-level writing s kills such as spelling and punctuation were targeted. T he following lessons were developed: (1)The reader's perception: What does the reader find important in a story? (2)Structure: Different ways to start a story - in what order should the events unfold ? (3)Conclusion: How does one finish a story? (4)Revising (someone else's) text: How can a text be improved? (5)Revising during writing: What changes do writers make while they write? Preparation of observation material Writing activities for film peers To prepare the observation mate rial, 10-13-year-old 'film peers ' (unknown to the participants) were recruited and filmed in the Lund University Humanities Lab and in the department of Logopedics, Phoniatrics and Audiology at L und University. The film peers came to the lab or department either on their ow n or two by two with a friend they already knew. The environment was set up to resem ble a writing workshop or a small classroom and was without visual or auditiv e disturbances. The writing workshop took place after school and the whole session took around two hours. The film peers were introduced to the purpose of the fi lms - that other students may be helped by observing them. The film peers were f urther asked to do their best but there was no right or wrong way to do the writin g activities. The activities were prepared to rese mble age-relevant classroom act ivities, so that the 37 resulting films did not have to be manipulated with regard to w hat the students were saying or doing. The film peers were introduced to the writing activities and asked to work on them without receiving verbal prompts from the resea rchers during filming. Further, they were prompted to speak loudly and clearl y enough to be heard in the resulting films. During activities with only one film pe er, the film peer was instructed to think aloud about what they were doing. Care was taken to make the films as ecologically valid as possible. As expected, the different film peers carried out the writing a ctivities in different ways because of differences in age, maturity, and writing skill s. This yielded a rich material of film to choose clips from. In some cases, the film peers focused on other aspects of the activities than t hose the research team had anti cipated when preparing the writing activities. If the film peers focused on something which was not expected by the researchers but valid to the curriculum, their focus was chosen, rather than trying to prompt other answers. Selection of film material The resulting films featured twelve film peers, five girls and seven boys. Ten of these were working in pairs for some of the activities. See tab le 3 for examples from each lesson of what writing activity the film peers were doing, the film outcomes and lesson outcomes. From the several hours of film material, c lips which fit each lesson theme were selected from the different writing activitie s. Writing processes and text features on text level as well as word level were incl uded in the lessons. As the twelve film peers had differe nt writing proficiency and mat urity, the students would thus observe a variety of approaches to the writing activ ities. The clips where selected to illustrate different levels of writing skill and to generate reflection in the participating students on different ways of taking on the writi ng activities. Four to seven different clips were selected for each lesson. A professi onal film editor edited the film clips and improved the sound by decreasing noise to pr ovide the observing students with optimal conditions for understanding, especially important for the students with HL. Subtitles of what the film peers were saying were added, for those whose listening would be supported by reading. Lesson preparation Each lesson was carefully scripted around the film clips. Scrip ts for the lessons were prepared. These included information about timing of film clips and reflection as well as manuscripts of what to say. They could be followed verb atim, to ensure reliable intervention in all classes. The scripts included intr oduction of the lesson, prompts for reflection after film clips, and instructions for w riting down advice. The prompts, one or two prompts for each film clip, were prepared, to elicit more answers if the students were reluctant to start sharing their t houghts. All lessons 38 were rehearsed in a \"dry run\" w ithin the research group to furt her ensure reliability and to check the time schedule. To help the participating stude nts to formulate their advice su ccinctly, small sheets of paper (size A5) were prepared for them to write on. The stud ents were told that their advice would be collected for \"next year's students in this grade\", so that they would think of important advice to themselves or their peers, r ather than catering to a teacher or researcher. In the fifth and final lesson, the lea rning section of the lesson was to write down advice concerning that lesson theme (revising while writing), and any advice they wished to point out from the earlier lessons. Slides introducing each lesson theme were prepared to rem ind the students of the themes they had worked with. The students thus reflected on all five lessons and on what another learner would need to know when writing a narrative. The students were told that their advice would be collected and given back to them. Table 3. Examples of writing activities, corresponding film outcomes an d lesson outcomes from each lesson. Lesson Writing activity Film outcome Lesson outcome 1 The reader's perception \"Read and reflect on a personal narrative written by another student\" Some film peers react mostly on form aspects, others on content. The importance of making the reader want to continue to read becomes apparent. Students reflect on the reader's perspective. 2 Structure \"Using this story board, try to think of different ways to tell the story. C an one start somewhere else than in the beginning?\" Some film peers play around with starting with the coda, or 'in medias res'. Some film peers stress the importance of following the chronological order. Students reflect on alternatives to a linear narrative. 3 Conclusion \"Write about an occasion when you saved somebody from a jam\" (written on a computer with keystroke logging) Audio of film peer thinking aloud + screencast of computer screen during the writing process. Students reflect on the importance of a coda. 4 Revising someone else's text \"Read this story, try to improve it by changing some of the words/wordings\" Film peers discuss how to improve a text (some successfully, some not). Prompting students to reflect on others' writing processes, that text is not necessarily finished after the last f ull stop. 5 Online revision \"Write about an occasion when you saved somebody from a jam\" (written on a computer with keystroke logging) Screencast of the text making the writing process visible. Examples of editing of typos and of global revision, i.e. adding crucial information. Making visible the writing process with its online editing, revising and thought processes during writing. The written advice from the students was collected and printed in a booklet, \"Tell me more!\" which was given to all students after the data collec tion had finished. Thereby, the students thus had the content of the lessons summe d up in the form of 39 their own advice. See Table 5 in the Method section for some ex amples of the students' advice reflecting each lesson. Self-efficacy scale Self-efficacy was measured in sev eral of the observational lear ning studies which inspired the intervention in the present dissertation (Braaksma et al., 2002; Raedts et al., 2007). In the study by Raedts and colleagues, the parti cipants were university students who wrote a literary review. Self-efficacy and text qu ality were measured. Only a third of the students we re well \"calibrate d\", i.e. had s elf-efficacy which was close to their actual performance, but after an observational l earning intervention, fewer students overestimated their abilities (2007). Pajares an d colleagues showed that although both girls and boys agreed that girls were the be tter writers (in the studies), girls and boys often r eported similar self-efficacy & Valiante, 2001). The authors suggested that girls may answer the self-efficacy scale differently from boys (Pajares, 1996; P ajares et 1999; Pajares & Valiante, 2001). According to Bandura, self-efficacy should be measured in a dom ain-specific way (2006). Statements must be constructed for a specific genre, bu t not be task-specific, i.e. only for a specific type of assignment. If statements begi n with \"I can...\" they are considered more specific to self-efficacy than for example questions (2006). Bandura further states that there must be many intermediate ste ps when marking the scale and suggests that one should answer with a number from 0 to 100, stating to what extent one agrees with that statement. This position is su pported by Pajares and colleagues, who found that 0-100 scales were psychometrical ly sounder than 1-5 point Likert scales (2001). With these precautions, the per son filling out the scale will state their self-efficacy, or self-perceived ability , rather than for example rating an earlier task. A Swedish scale developed to measure se lf-efficacy for reading and writing was available (Wolff, 2010). The scale is a nswered by choosing one of four options and not all statements start with \"I can... \". It would therefore not be valid for the purposes in this research project. After devel opment of the scale in the present dissertation had begun, SEWS, a self-efficacy scale for writing was published (Bruning et al., 2013b). As scales and performance as sessment should correspond, SEWS may no t have been suitabl e for the purposes of this dissertation. Differences in self-efficacy may be based on students' age, as described earlier. However, reporting self-efficacy may be done differently in dif ferent age groups. Young children may not have as varied self-efficacy between dom ains or tasks. Interests and self-assessment of earlier work may contribute to self-efficacy, and valid scales may be difficult to make. Strong self-efficacy con tributes to motivation and performance, and calibration (accuracy) of self-efficacy is difficult to assess. 40 The scales by Braaksma and colleagues (2002) were developed to measure self- efficacy for expository and argumentative writing in older stud ents than those in the present dissertation. Their scale had eighteen statements in al l, as did the scale developed for this dissertation. A third of the statements only had to be translated from Dutch (by bilingual members of the research team), as they were not genre- dependent or age-dependent but pertaining to general writing sk ills, for example spelling and revision. The developed scale (as Braaksma's scale ), followed Bandura's recommendations for self-efficacy scales (Bandura, 20 06). This means that it was constructed to be domain-specific but not task-spec ific and all statements started with \"I can...\". To make sure that the students would f ill out the scale according to what they thought of their abilities, rather than assessing their performance in previous tasks, t he following instructions were written on the first page of the booklet and would also be read aloud before they st arted filling out the scale: Imagine the following scenario: In school, you get a writing as signment where you are to write a narrativ e story about something you have experie nced. For example, it could be writing a story about the most exciting time you had d uring the summer vacation. It should be written so that somebody in your class c an understand it, and the text should be about one page long. You are not going to wr ite this text yourself, but please answer some questions about what writing such an ass ignment would be like. Answer each question by marking the horizontal line benea th each question with a vertical line. The further to the right your mark is, the mor e you agree with the statement. In the scale developed by Braaksma and colleagues and in Bandur a's recommendations, students were asked to write a number between 0 and 100 indicating to what extent they ag ree with the statements (Bandu ra, 2006; Braaksma et al., 2002). As the students in the present dissertation were young, making a mark with a pen on a continuous scale was expected to be easier to g rasp than writing down a number 0-100. Cognitive and linguistic tests Alleviation of the c ognitive load has been suggested as an expl anation of effects of observational learning (Braaksma et al., 2002). Despite this, c ognitive measures such as WM capacity have not b een measured in the studies descr ibed above. The measurement of WM capacity was th erefore included in the studie s presented here. Since language skills are crucial for academic achievement, and especially since students with HL often meet criteria for LD, language comprehen sion and reading comprehension tests were included in data collection as possibl e predictors for text quality. 41 Parallel study of interv ention led by teachers In Papers I-III, the intervention was carried out by researcher s. In a separate study, described in a master's thesis by two SLP students (Hammarstedt & Karan, 2016), teachers used the intervention in their own Grade 4 and 5 class es after training, led by the research group. The intervention in the present disserta tion was adapted to be used by teachers in the school district. Based on the filmed ma terial and the scripted lessons, a teacher's manual for the intervention lessons was de veloped. Teachers in the school district of the students in Papers I and III were of fered a full day of training by the research group and provided with the manual and the film clips. They could thus carry out the observational learning intervention in their classes. The teachers were asked to follow th e manual closely. Some teachers performed the intervention in their classes. N arrative texts written before a nd after intervention were collected by the research group. The teachers split one in tervention lesson in two and allowed student s extended time for the learning section of the lessons. Results showed improved text qua lity after completion of the fi ve intervention lessons (Hammarstedt & Karan, 2016). 43 Method In the following section, the study design and procedure will f irst be described, followed by descriptions of the participating students and test s of cognitive and linguistic ability. Further, text quality measurement, interven tion lessons and the self-efficacy scale will be presented. Lastly, considerations o f statistical analyses and ethical issues will be reported. Design and procedure The full data collection (writing narratives, filling out self- efficacy scales and performing cognitive and linguistic tests) and intervention too k thirteen lessons of 40 minutes each. Data collection and intervention were performe d in the classrooms of the students, during their Swedish lessons, which were repla ced with data collection or intervention lessons. An overview of the data col lection and intervention is found in Figure 1. Written personal narratives were collected at four points in time (Texts 1-4). Self-efficacy scales were filled ou t twice, and tests of WM, language (sentence) comprehen sion and reading comprehension w e r e administered. The intervention took place between Texts 1 and 2 (intervention first) or between Texts 2 and 3 (wait first). All data collection (asi de from Text 4) was designed to fit within one semest er to avoid general maturation effects. From the first data collection and until Text 3 was written, the teacher s were asked not to focus on written narratives during their classes. Four classes of students with NH and two classes of students with HL participated. Two classes of NH students in one school had intervention first , while two classes in another school had regular Swedish lessons first. Thus, stud ents would constitute their own controls. In the classes for students with HL, the gr oups were small, and all students received intervention at the same time. In Grade 6 there are extensive national assessments of the subject s of Swedish, English and Ma th which affect the schedules of several weeks of the semester, as well as the focu s of the students. Further, teachers recommended that the intervention should not be implemented in Grade 4 as they thought those students would be too young. This ultimately led to implementation in Grade 5 among students with NH. For practical reasons (foremost, the national assessments in Grade 6) all students wi th HL (who were in Grades 5-8) received intervention after Text 1 and had regular Swedish lessons after 44 Text 2. The self-efficacy scale and the cognitive and linguisti c tests were piloted on students of similar age before data collection. To make the intervention and the data collection ecologically v alid, all interaction with the students took place in the students' regular classroom s during Swedish lessons. All lessons were led by two persons in the research gr oup. The present author was responsible for data collection and led all interven tion lessons, for optimal reliability (Ebbels, 2017; 2019). A rese arch assistant (Viktoria \u00c5kerlund) ran films and slides during intervention lessons and assisted during data collection. The present author gave all lessons except those mi ssed due to parental leave - for the collection of Texts 3 and 4 in the classes of s tudents with HL and Text 4 in the classes of student s with NH. The research assistant was present for all lessons (assisted by another member of the research group for t he collection of texts 3 and 4). The present author and the research assistant thus be came well known to all students. Figure 1. Overview of the design . All students with HL and one sc hool with students with NH followed the upper path (intervention first). Students with NH in the other school foll owed the lower path (wait first). Personal narrative texts were written at four times (Texts 1-4). The self-efficacy scale (Self-effic.) was administered twice, after Texts 1 and 3. The working memory (WM) and language comprehension (Lang. comp.) te sts were administered after Text 1 and the reading comprehension test (Read. comp.) was administered after Text 3. Participants The 55 students with NH (see Table 4) in Papers I and III were in Grade 5. Normal hearing is here defined as not having any suspected or diagnose d HL. The eleven students with HL in Paper II were in Grades 5-8. The students i n papers I and III (all with NH) were in two schools in the same school district. The schools were located in similar areas, which were socio-economically relatively strong. For example, around 80 percent of parents in the area had received tertiary education, compared to 50-60 percent nationw ide (publicly available data). The students in the classes were unselected, i.e. all students who would follow typ ical lessons could participate in the study. The majority of students had Swedish as their first language. There were few bilingual students. 45 The students in Paper II (all with HL) represented a very heter ogeneous group. Their school classes were exclusively f or students with HL and they f ollowed the general Swedish curriculum (Skolverket, 2019a). The school received stu dents from the whole geographical region. All ha d a spoken first language. Bor n before the introduction of neonatal hearing screening, some students' HL w as not detected until they were several years old. Age at diagnosis with HL var ied from a few months up to ten years. In this dissertation, degree of HL is c lassified according to J.G. Clark (1981) as this was the classification at the time of diagnosis. Some of the students' HL would thus be classified as more severe now, follo wing the classification by WHO (see Table 2) (WHO). Parents or caregiver s were asked to provide audiological information and/or access to audiological medical records. The data which was provided was some what limited, from caregivers a s well as from medical records. A few caregivers did not give their consent fo r access to the medical records. Best ear hearing level (BEHL) could be found f or all students with HA whose information we had access to. Hearing level with ampli fication had been measured in only one case, whereas in all other participants it was measured without amplification. Data from students who chose not to participate in the studies was discarded, while they were still included in the lessons. This is described under Ethical considerations and furt her details are found in Papers I-III. Cognitive and linguistic tests The cognitive and linguistic tests which were used in this diss ertation were possible to administer in a whole class setting. Screenings and other ta sks which are common in schools are often administered as paper-and-pen-tasks like t he chosen tests. The tests are standardized or norm-referenced for students with NH. The tests are widely used in schools or by SLPs. More details on the tests can be fo und in the three papers. Table 4 gives an overview of the students' test results . Verbal WM was measured with a subtest from the Swedish dyslexia screening test Lilla Duvan (Wolff, 2010). It has a process component and a rec all component and the maximum score is 36. As an example, the students heard a le tter \"B\" and were then asked \"Is France larger than Denmark?\". They responded to the question by raising a YES or a NO sign (process component). Then they heard another letter \"J\" and were asked \"Is a bird a mammal?\". Again they raised a YES o r NO sign, and then they wrote down the two le tters, in the right order (recal l component). Language comprehension was measured with a sentence comprehensi on test developed to assess comprehension of grammar, (the Swedish vers ion of) TROG-2 (Bishop, 2009). With permission, the test was adapted slightly so that it could be given in the classroom. During the test, students listen to 80 sentences concerning 20 grammatical constructions. The sentences are short and gramm atically complex 46 and the test is considered sensitive for language disorder. The students listened to each sentence, chose the corresponding picture in a booklet and marked it. The adaptation may have made the test somewhat more difficult. Each grammatical construction answered correctly i n four cases yields one point. The maximum score is 20. This language comprehension test thus measured listening comprehension on sentence level. Reading comprehension was measured with SL40, a Swedish norm-re ferenced test (Magnusson & Naucl\u00e9r, 2010). The test consists of 40 sentences, each with several pictures to choose from, where one depicts the content of the sentence. It is norm- referenced only up to Grade 5. The reason for using this with older students with HL was that students with HL often fall behind, which made the risk of ceiling effects lower. However, good results on the test are difficult to interpret. Table 4.

The test Lilla Duvan is a screening test for reading and writing difficulties (Wolff, 2010), TROG-2 i s a test of grammati cal sentence compreh ension (Bishop, 2009), and SL40 is a reading comprehension test (Magnusson & Naucl\u00e9r, 2010). Narrative texts and text quality The personal narratives were written on the computer. In the ob servation films, the film peers wrote on the computer, and there were examples of re vision within texts. A curricular goal is that students learn to write by hand and o n the computer, and thus the students were used to this mode of writing (Skolverket , 2019a). Further, writing on the computer made using a keystroke logging program possible, so that further studies may explore writing processes before and after intervention. The topics of the narratives were chosen so that they would be comp arable. Two of the topics had been used in earlier st udies, generating texts simil arly (Johansson, 2009; 47 Str\u00f6mqvist, 1996). The other two were constructed to generate s imilar texts, in length and elaboration. There are many ways of measuring text quality. Holistic or glob al ratings by trained raters have been found valid (Tillema et al., 2012). This metho d has also been used in earlier observational learning studies (Raedts et al., 2017) . In the present project, a panel of six raters was assembled and trained to rate the tex t quality. They were trained to give a holistic rating based on aspects of genre, st ructure, organisation, punctuation, grammar, spelling, text length and content. The ra ters were university students in the social sciences, i.e. with less focus on langua ge than students of Swedish or SLP students. The raters were trained by members of the research group. For reliability, they practiced on benchmark texts. The benchma rk texts were texts of the same subjects, written by peers of similar age in a pilo t before data collection. These texts were introduced to help the raters answer similarly . Text quality was assessed by marking a VAS scale. Markings were measured and tex t quality given a number from 0 to 100. Out of the six raters, three rated each text. The texts were distributed among the raters eve nly so that all raters would ra te texts from the four points in time and so that the same raters would rate as few of the same texts as possible. Apart from this, the texts were distributed at random . The raters did not know that intervention was involved or that some of the student s had HL. Descriptive data in the papers show mean values of the text qua lity, but in the regression analyses, all data points were measured. The interra ter reliability of the ratings was strong (Cronbach's = .90). There was some data loss which was not considered vital. For th ree students with NH, there were three texts and for all others there were four. One text received only one rating, eight received two ra tings, and one received four r atings. One student with HL only wrote three texts and one other text was not rated . Closer descriptions are found in Papers I and II, see also Statistical methods and analyses below. Intervention lessons The lesson plan for the intervention lessons could be followed as planned and scripted in all but one case. In that lesson, a slight adjustme nt from the lesson plan was needed as it took more time than was planned. The same adju stment was made the following times the lesson was given. The group sizes for t he reflection and learning steps varied from pairs to groups of up to five studen ts, to gain advantages of both small and large groups. Before each lesson, the student s were divided into groups of two to five and the classroom was furnished according ly. The researchers showed each student to their place to sit directly when they en tered the classroom. Thus, time and focus were not lost when reassigning seats. Tabl e 5 shows some examples of advice which the students wrote \"for next year's st udents\". Note that 48 the students had a focus on form (for example spelling and punc tuation) but were also displaying reader awareness and text structure on a more global text level (\"start with the exciting bit\", \"a bit f unny\") after the intervention. The learning stage, in which students wrote down advice for \"ne xt year's students in this class\", was done individually or in the groups working together that lesson. The five intervention lessons were 40 minutes each and followed the prepared written scripts. The lessons would be given over three weeks, i n place of the regular Swedish lessons. Table 5.

Like spaces, misspellings, full stop, commas or better sentences. filled out the 18 statements of the self-efficacy scale on paper by marking to what extent they agreed with each statement on a 100 mm VAS scale. See Table 6 for a list of the statements. Scoring was done by m easuring the 100 mm scale and thus the self-efficacy score could vary between 0 and 100. The statements were adapted for narratives. They concerned different aspects o f writing: form as well as content aspects; process as well as product aspects. Ex amples of form aspects are structure of a text, or spelling, while content aspects concern for example what is relevant to write about the setting. An example of a pr ocess aspect is finding letters on the keyboard, while product concerns for example text cohesion and overall structure. 49 Table 6. Self-efficacy statements Statement 1 I can quickly write a text on the computer. 2 I can find all the letters on the keyboard. 3 I can write a text without spelling errors. 4 I can use periods, question mark s and exclamation marks in the right places. 5 I can use commas in the right places. 6 I can divide my text into paragraphs. 7 I can write a heading that fi ts with the content. 8 I can write a story in such a way that the reader understands w here the story took place and who was in it. 9 I can divide my text into beginning, middle and end. 10 I can write a story with an unexpected ending. 11 I can write a story in such a way that the reader understands w hat happened. 12 I can begin the story in an exciting way, so that the reader wa nts to continue reading. 13 I can change one or several words in my text if I am not satisf ied with what I had wr itten initially. 14 I can write both lon g and short sentences. 15 I can decide which parts of my s tory need to be explained to th e reader. 16 I can read through my text and correct spelling mistakes. 17 I can read through my text and make changes to improve it. 18 I can write a text which is one page long. Statistical methods and analyses In the present dissertation, linear mixed effects models (LME) and ANOVA were performed, aside from descriptive measurements. In LME, continu ous variables (text quality, results on cognitive and linguistic tests) as we ll as categorical variables (gender; intervention Y/N, follow-up Y/N; class, school grade) can be used as predictors. LME is considered a robust method of measuring inte rvention even when there is some missing data, which is suitable in a school context where students are sometimes absent and where data may be lost (Quen\u00e9 & van den Bergh, 2004). These advantages have made LME very common in repeated m easure designs as well as in other study designs with hierarchically s tructured data (Baayen et al., 2008; Casals et al., 2014; Meteyard & Davies, 2020). In paper III, the difference in self-efficacy before and after intervention was m easured with repeated measures ANOVA. Aside from statistical analyses, a qualitative approach was taken to describe features of the participants in Paper II. Inter-rater reliability was measured for all texts together (fr om students with NH and HL) with Cronbach's . 50 Ethical considerations The research in this dissertati on was carried out in accordance w i t h t h e recommendations of The Swedish Ethical Review Authority and the protocol was approved by the Regional Ethical Review Board in Lund (which pr eceded the present Swedish Ethical Review Authority), Dnr. 2013/270. The p articipating students and the film peers and their caregivers gave informed consent in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki before inclusion. The film pee rs and their caregivers gave consent to use of the films in the intervention lessons during the research project. Before any data collection, the project was discussed with head teachers and school board officials of potential schools. Further, the research gro up visited parent- teacher meetings, before initiati ng data collection or interven tion, to describe the project and answer any questions. A s mentioned in the Introduct ion, in Sweden the individual teacher has the mandate to choose teaching methods i n accordance with the policy of that particular school. The head teachers and tea chers thus had the authority to allow the research group to implement the interven tion and perform data collection in the classes, replacing other lessons in the subject of Swedish. Originally, data collection from schools with no intervention w as planned, but school officials did not agree to data collection without inter vention. Thus, the students in the participating schools all received intervention, with different start times in relation to the intervention. The Ethical Review Board recommended that the whole class shoul d be included in data collection and intervention, in order not to single out an y student. All students who ordinarily took part in classroom activities were thus pres ent for the data collection and intervention and could not opt out of the lesson s. Data from non- participating students were not saved or analyzed. The small number of students with HL has been considered. The students in question have been described case by case in some respects, and some aud iological data have been excluded to preserve their anonymity. Further, neither loc ations of schools nor the year of data collection have been revealed. 51 Results The following paragraphs briefly describe the main results of e ach paper. The four main research questions of this dissertation are addressed in t he summary of results. Paper I In Paper I, the aims were to develop the observational learning intervention and to evaluate its effects on text quality, considering the students' individual predispositions. The participants were fifty-five Grade 5 stud ents with NH. Research questions: (a) Do narrative skills as measured by text quality improve as a consequence of the intervention? (b) Do any effects last? (c) Can WM capacity, language comprehension, reading comprehens ion, or gender predict text quality o r intervention effects? There was a mild, but statistically significant positive interv ention effect on text quality. This effect had diminished at follow-up after four mon ths and was no longer significant. Higher WM scores were linked to higher text qualit y ratings but there were no effects of language com prehension or reading comprehens ion. There was a clear effect of gender, showing considerably higher text qualit y ratings for girls' texts. While gender and WM pred icted text quality in the regres sion, neither interacted significantly with intervention. Students with bette r reading comprehension did however derive significantly more benefit fro m the intervention. This constituted the only significan t interaction in the mixed effects regression analysis. 52 Paper II In Paper II, the aims were to investigate whether the observati onal learning intervention was feasible to u se in classes with students with HL and to study the students' cognitive, linguistic, audiological, and demographic factors in relation to narrative text quality. Eleven students with HL, in Grades 5-6 and 7-8, participated in the study. Research questions: (d) Is observational learning s uitable for the training of narr ative text writing in students wi th HL? (e) What are the effects of WM capacity, language comprehension , reading comprehension, school grade, a nd gender on narrative text quality in students with HL? (f) What associations are there between degree of HL, age at am plification and text quali ty? The observational learning intervention was performed in two cl asses for students with HL, in school years 5-6 and 7-8, respectively, and found t o work well in the classroom. Text quality did not change significantly over the c ourse of the four texts. Some students, mainly girls, recei ved slightly higher text qual ity ratings over time and some, mainly boys, slightly lower. Regression analysis did not show significant effects of WM capacity, language comprehension, or reading comp rehension on text quality. Text quality varied considerably between students. Gro uping the students by school class and gender showed significant differences in te xt quality. Girls in Grade 7-8 had the highest text quality, followed by girls in Gr ade 5-6. Boys in Grade 5-6 followed and boys in Grade 7-8 had the lowest text qu ality results. There was considerable individual variability between students regard ing cognitive and linguistic factors, hearing sensitivity and time factors. Inspe ction of individual results showed that the three students with the highest text quality had lower age at amplification (at age 1-4) than the three students with the low est text quality (amplification at age 6-10). The great heterogeneity of student s with HL suggests additional individual adaptation in the further development of the observational learning intervention. 53 Paper III In paper III, the aims were to explore self-efficacy for narrat ive writing before and after an intervention which may affect motivation. While Paper I showed differences in narrative text quality for boys and girls, but similar inter vention effects, this paper explored associations between gender, text quality and self-eff icacy. The participants were the same 55 students in Grade 5 with NH as in Paper I. Research questions: (g) Does self-efficacy for narra tive writing change after the i ntervention, and if it does, in what way? (h) Are there any gender differences? (i) Is self-efficacy related to te xt quality, and if so, in wha t way? Self-efficacy increased significantly after the intervention. B oys and girls had similar self-efficacy, despite the significantly higher text qu ality ratings of girls' texts. There was an association between self-efficacy and text quality pre- as well as post-intervention. Internal c onsistency within the self-effi cacy scale was strong. In conclusion, students' strong self-efficacy for narrative wri ting supports previous findings. The observational learning intervention may have rein forced students' self-efficacy. Gender may influence self-efficacy and how state ments in self- efficacy scales are answered. Text quality ratings and self-eff icacy had positive, moderately strong correlations before as well as after interven tion. Students may not be able to differentiate between self-efficacy, general writing skills, task performance, and self-regulation at this age. Self-efficacy sca les should thus be carefully constructed with respect to students' age, genre, ins truction, and general educational context. Summary of results The five-lesson observational learning intervention and the sel f-efficacy scale was developed and implemented in classes for Grade 5 students with NH as well as in classes for students with HL in Grades 5-8. The observational l earning paradigm was new to the students. The lessons were well received by the students. The intervention had a significant, positive effect on text quality for the group of students with NH. At a follow-up after four months, the effect was no lo nger significant. For the group of students with HL, there were no significant change s in text quality over time. In the students with NH, higher WM scores were associated with higher text 54 quality ratings. Further, students with NH with higher scores o n the reading comprehension test had stronger intervention effects. In studen t s w i t h H L , t h e r e were no overall effects of cognitive and linguistic factors. Th e students with HL with the highest text quality were amplified earlier than stude nts with low text quality. For all students, whether with NH or HL, female gender was associated with higher text quality ratings. Self-efficacy for writing increase d significantly after the intervention for students with NH. Students with high text qual ity ratings had strong self-efficacy for narrative writing. Boys and girls had similar self-efficacy, despite the significantly higher text quality ratings of girls' texts. 55 Discussion The four research questions are discussed in the General discus sion. The first section addresses development and implementation of the intervention an d the self-efficacy scale. The second section concerns text quality and text qualit y changes. In the third section, cognitive and linguistic f actors, gender, and, for par ticipants with HL, school grade and audiological factors are discussed. In the fou rth section, self- efficacy and changes in self-efficacy are addressed. Under Meth odological considerations, some strengths and weaknesses of the methodolog ical choices in this dissertation are discussed. Finally, some future direction s for method development and research are suggested. General discussion Development and implementation Prior to the studies in this dissertation, observational learni ng intervention had not been implemented in the Swedish school context, to the knowledg e of the author. Self-efficacy scales for writing are not commonly used in the S wedish school context. The self-efficacy scale was developed for these studie s and was thus another new lesson feature for the participating students. Teac hing students why and how to give and receive peer feedback is a curricular goal (Sko lverket, 2019a, 2020a). Students may for example exchange texts, read and give feedback on a peer's text before revision. Swedish students are thus somewhat familiar with reflection on texts and revision. The structured group reflecti on on writing processes which was an integral part of the intervention, was however new to the students. The first research question was whether it was feasible to perf orm the intervention during regular Swedish lessons in the age groups. The manual wa s easy to follow and students participated willingly in the intervention. Teache rs and head teachers were interested and engaged in the process. As mentioned in the Method development chapter, some teachers who took part in the observa tional learning intervention training chose to use it in their own classes the subsequent school year, as a method of developing students' writing. Self-efficacy scal es may be valuable tools to use in Swedish schools since self-efficacy and other a spects of motivation 56 are important predictors for goal achievement (Callinan et al., 2018; De Smedt et al., al., 2007; Schunk, 1991). Several adaptations were made in order to make the intervention and the self- efficacy scale appropriate for t he Swedish school setting and t he chosen age group. Adaptations to the intervention were made to suit younger stude nts, as earlier studies have often focused on high school or undergraduate levels (Braa ksma et al., 2002; Couzijn, 1999; Raedts et al., 2017; Rijlaarsdam et al., 2008). The genre was thus changed from expository and argumentative writing, which earlie r studies have focused on, to narrative writing, which the younger students in the present project were more used to and which suited the curriculum. Lastly, to i nclude measures of language comprehension and reading comprehension in an observat ional learning study is also a novelty. So is the inclusion of a measure of WM capacity. Although alleviation of cognitive resources is seen as a possible reason for the efficacy of observational learning, WM was, for example, not studied in the papers which inspired the design of the present studies (Braaksma et al., 20 02). Text quality before and after intervention and at follow-up Paper I showed mild, but significant intervention effects for s tudents with NH. Paper II was not designed as an effect study, but descriptive data of text quality before and after intervention showed no differences in text quality in stu dents with HL from pre- to post-intervention or to follow-up. The intervention eff ects for students with NH were no longer significant at follow-up. Positive intervention effects on text quality of observational learning were found in comparable earl ier observational learning studies but they did not include a follow-up, and long -term effects are thus not clear (Couzijn, 1999; Raedts et al., 2007; Rijlaarsdam et a l., 2008). Further, the students in the earlier mentioned studies were older than the s tudents with NH in the present dissertation (Couzijn, 1999; Raedts et al., 2007; R ijlaarsdam et al., 2008). This may have affected t heir ability to generalize from observations of what peers were thinking and doing to their own writing. Between data collection of Texts 3 and 4, the researchers did not have any contact with the students, and their teachers did not have specific inf ormation on the intervention. There was thus no reinforcement of knowledge rela ted to the intervention which could be impor tant for sustained skills. The follow-up texts (Text 4) were written in the semester after the intervention. For students with NH Text 4 was written during the spring semester, and for students with H L, it was written after the summer vacation. Several studies show that many stude nts experience \"summer loss\" of knowledge and skills in various subjects after t h e s u m m e r vacation (Cooper et al., 1996; Rosqvist et al., 2019).57 The lack of improved text quality after the observational learn ing lessons in students with HL in Paper II indicates that further development is neede d before evaluation and implementation of observati onal learning intervention for s tudents with HL. Students with HL receive degraded source signals not only due t o the HL per se but also due to the linguistic limita tions they often demonstrate. If the acoustic environment is non-optimal, sp eech perception and language comp rehension are further challenged (Mattys et al., 2012). Students with vulnerable listening skills or other processing l imitations, for example students with HL and/or LD have even more pronounced needs for effective writing instruction, as fewer teaching methods have been found effectiv e in clinical groups. Structured intervention where students may focus on one thing a t a time has been found effective for students at risk for LD (Wolbers et al., 20 18; Wolbers et al., 2015). Observational learning should therefore be further explo red and developed. Teaching writing is an important element of teacher training an d continued professional development. SLPs i n school settings as well as te achers may use observational learning as one tool to strengthen students' writ ing skills. Implementation requires time and continued collaboration with a nd support from researchers (Ebbels et al., 2019; Markussen-Brown et al., 2017) , or between teachers (van Schaik et al., 2019). Despite amplification and acoustic accommodations in the classr oom, the students with HL spend time in adverse listening conditions outside clas srooms. They experience listening effort and need a structured education con text. A possible improvement to the observational learning lessons which may inc rease effects could be more explicit instructions about the film peers' activities. F o r e x a m p l e , t h e teacher could offer linguistic and metalinguistic explicit teac hing and scaffolding by asking students to point out when film peers set goals or in struct themselves. Such explicit teaching strategies have rendered effects in stud ents with HL (Wolbers et al., 2018). Influencing factors and predictors of text quality For all students (NH and HL), gender was a significant predicto r of text quality, girls receiving higher text quality ratings than boys. The effe ct of gender was greater than any intervention effects or other possible predicting fact ors in the mixed effects regressions of students with NH and HL in Papers I and II. This is not completely unexpected as girls generally do better in school in Sweden (Sk olverket, 2019b). Studies of writing have sometimes shown gender effects favoring girls (Kanaris, 1999). Other studies have shown no gender differences, but this may depend on the included participants. For example, Johansson (2009) found no g ender differences but the students with reading and writing difficulties, mostly boys, were excluded in that study. 58 Students with NH with higher scores on the reading comprehensio n test had somewhat stronger intervention effects. A possible explanation i s t h e M a t t h e w effect, i.e. the cumulative advantage of early reading skills w hich lead to continued reading success. This is recurrent in literacy studies. Student s who read more may have more experience with narra tive structure and written langu age. In students with HL, school grade turned out as another importa nt factor for text quality. Girls in Grade 7-8 received higher text quality rating s than girls in Grade 5-6, followed by boys in Grade 5-6, and lastly by boys in Grade 7-8. The students with HL represented a more diverse group as to age, audiologica l, linguistic and cognitive factors compared to the students with NH. Socio-econo mic status (SES) was not investigated in this study. Since the classes for stude nts with HL received students from an entire region, SES may have been more diverse among the students with HL than among the students with NH, whose schools were loc ated in areas with high SES. Results from PISA show that the gap in reading c omprehension, mathematics and science knowledge widens between Swedish studen ts from homes with high and low SES (OECD, 2016, 2019). The finding that boys in Grade 7-8 had lower text quality than boys in Grade 5-6 is unexpected. A possible explanation is school placement changes. Students with HL who struggle in mainstream cla sses sometimes move to classes wh ich are exclusive for students with HL as they get older (SPSM, 2008). With such a small number of participants, individual differe nces may render high impact in analyses. The students with HL with the highest text quality ratings were two bimodally aided girls (using one HA and one CI). It may be worth noting that ch ildren with CI in Sweden receive considerably more rehabilitative support than ch ildren with HA. As an example, all children with un ilateral or bilateral CI are fo llowed regularly with checkups and have access to an SLP. This is sometimes not the c ase for children with HA, at least those with mild /moderate HL who, in many cas es, never meet an SLP (Ros\u00e9n et al., 2019), despite a high risk for LD in this gr oup. The support from the healthcare system for student s with CI may positively affec t school motivation and performance, when comparing to students with HA. None of th e other predictors explained differences in text quality in students with HL. The small group of eleven students in Grades 5-8 indicates that all results must be inter preted with great care. A lack of significant differences is not unexpected, as student s with HL represent a very heterogeneous group (Marschark & Knoors, 2018b). Regarding predicting factors, WM capacity turned out to predict text quality in students with NH but not in students with HL. It has been sugge sted that observational learning alleviates cognitive load compared to tr aditional writing exercises, since learning is sep arated from the writing task lo ad (Rijlaarsdam et al., 2008). Writing is considered highly dependent on WM (McCutchen, 2011). Possibly, the students with NH were still working on automatizi ng transcription and other lower-level writing skills, thus spending WM capacity (Dr ijbooms et al., 59 2015) and leaving less resources for higher-level skills such a s finding the right words, organizing the story and making revisions. The somewhat older students with HL may have progressed further in this automatization, whi ch could decrease their WM load during writing. WM capacity results did not modul ate intervention effects, which may mean that students with different WM capacit y received the intervention similarly. While WM may be alleviated during the o bservational learning intervention, freeing cognitive capacity for learning, WM will still be taxed during writing. More automatized low-level transcription skills predict text quality in students with NH as well as with HL, possibly because WM cap acity can be freed for higher-level writing skills as planning and organization of the text (Arf\u00e9 et al., 2014; Drijbooms et al., 2015; McCutchen, 2000). Verbal WM capac ity was found to contribute more to text quality than age or reading comprehe nsion in written narratives in elementary school students with severe or profoun d HL (Arf\u00e9 et al., 2015). The test scores of reading comprehension (Magnusson & Naucl\u00e9r, 2010) and language (listening) comprehension (Bishop, 2009) were not sign ificantly associated with text quality in thi s study. When examining the results of students with HL, the students with the lowest text quality ratings did however have low results on the language comprehension test. Self-efficacy change, text quality and gender As shown in Paper III, students' previously strong self-efficac y increased post- intervention. By observing peers and reflecting on their own an d together with classmates, students may have increased their belief in their c apabilities to perform the writing task described in the instructions to the scale (se e Method development). The described task was similar to the personal narrative tasks which they were given. Returning to the sources of self-efficacy posited by Ban dura (1986), the intervention lessons may have affected three of them ( vicarious experience, social persuasion, and physiological and emotional state ). First and foremost, students gained vicarious experience by observation of peers in t he film clips. Additionally, the structured reflection on t he film clips and writing down ad vice for another peer can be seen as a form of social persuasion . To discuss film clips and to write down advice may have \"persuaded\" the s tudents that they had importan t, useful knowledge of narrative writing. Observing peers who are working both on their own and on others' texts may make students feel more at ease about the possibility of revising a text and how to do it. This may contribute to an imp roved physiological and emotional state . Observation of peers may thus be a valuable way of increasing students' motivation for writing. The students were asked to indicate with marks on the VAS scale s the extent to which they agreed with each self-efficacy statement, and most o ften marked the scales between \"average\" and \"completely\". Their self-efficacy was thus 'strong' 60 rather than 'weak'. Strong self-efficacy at this age is in conc urrence with earlier research (Bruning et al., 2013a; Pajares, 2003). At the age of the students (around 12 years) however, self-efficacy starts decreasing and becoming more diversified between domains. This decrease may be due to calibration to ach ievement (Muenks et al., 2018; Stipek, 2002). However, performance should improv e with age, even if demands also increase. One explanation may be that self-efficac y is linked to self- esteem which decreases during adolescence. Self-efficacy was significantly correlated with text quality be fore and after intervention. Further, internal consistency within the scale wa s high, meaning that no statement was judged very dissimilar to the others and sugge sting that the students had a holistic sense of self-efficacy for the domain o f narrative writing. Despite the obvious differences in text quality ratings of boys and girls, where girls' texts were assessed as having better quality, boys and girls re ported similar self- efficacy. This did not change after intervention. Similar resul ts were found by Pajares and colleagues in a series of studies (Pajares et al., 1999; Pajares & Valiante, 1999, 2001). Although gir ls reported similar self-efficacy to b oys, they often found that they were better writers t han boys when comparing texts (P ajares et al., 1999; Pajares & Valiante, 1999). The authors interpreted this not as differences in students' true self-efficacy, but as differences in how self-ef ficacy is reported, depending on gender or possi bly gender orientation. Methodological considerations In the following, some aspects of the method and method develop ment are discussed. In Paper I, the two wait first classes were in one school and the two intervention first classes were in the other. An alternative would have been one class in each school following the intervention first path, to control for possible differences between the schools. This was decided against, as students woul d perhaps have discussed intervention between classes, which would have confou nded the wait condition. In Paper II all eleven students followed the intervention first path. As the participants were few and the group heterogenous in age and as to audiological factors, the results must be interpreted with caution. It was possible to give all lessons according to the same scrip t in all classes. Similar reflections after observation of the films were made in all cla sses, whether NH or HL students. This is interpreted as sufficient reliability of t he scripts of the intervention lessons. An alternative to researchers performing the intervention would have been training the students' own teachers to perform the intervention, which could pose reliability issues. Some teachers would know t heir students better than other teachers or have more knowledge of students which ma y affect 61 prompting. Different teachers could unknowingly add or subtract from the method due to their previous knowledge or believe more or less in the efficacy of the intervention. These possible confounding factors may have resul ted in the stronger intervention results in the parallel study of teachers using th e intervention method the following school year. The film peers were comparable in age (10-13 years) to the majo rity of the participating students, and thus probably in language and writi ng skills too. Seeing models with whom one can identif y is an important motivational factor (Raedts et al., 2007; Raedts et al., 2017) bu t the extent to which the par ticipants identified with film peers was not studied. Some students with HL were older th an all film peers. It is possible that older students found film peers childish and n ot motivating as peers. The two schools for students with NH were in one school distric t. Several head teachers in the school district were approached, and the head t eacher at each school decided whether the intervention could be carried out in their school. The two schools were located in similar, socio-economically strong area s and a smaller portion of students were bilingual compared to many Swedish sch ools. The students in this dissertation did therefore not represent a cross-sectio n of Swedish students regarding linguistic background an d SES. There are associations between linguistic abilities and multilingual background, where results of formal tests measuring language skills favor monolingual students, but the school dist rict contributes considerably more to differenc es between mono- and bilingual st udents than bilingualism itself (Rosqvist et al., 2019). The intervention was developed for Grades 4-6. Grade 5 was chos en for practical reasons in discussion with school m anagement and teachers. Man y of the Swedish lessons in Grade 6 are used for national assessments as mention ed before and there would thus be less time for implementing a new intervention. So me teachers advised against implementation in Grade 4 as the students could be too young to have the full benefit of the method. Considering that observational lear ning has been developed for older students befo re, the intervention could be better suited for students in Grade 6. The reflection phase may be more beneficia l to students with more developed metacognitive abilities, which could influence t he whole group. Performing researcher-led intervention in schools is challengin g. The close collaboration with school managem ent and personnel is time-cons uming but crucial for optimal effects (Ebbels et al., 2019). However, even with c areful planning and information to all parties, schedules are vulnerable, for examp le to sports days and national assessments, which may influence timing. To meet these challenges, the research group prepared meetings with school management, headma sters, and teachers to explain the theory, method, and design and took par t in parent-teacher meetings. Verbal WM capacity was measured with a subtest from a screening test for reading disabilities 'Lilla Duvan' (Wolff, 2010) developed for classroo m screening. It was 62 carried out in the classroom, according to the test manual. As it is an auditory task, students' hearing sensitivity may have affected results. Langua ge comprehension was measured on sentence level with a test of receptive grammar (Bishop, 2009). As in the WM task, results may have been confounded by poor hea ring sensitivity. Hearing was not measured in students with NH. The results on th e language comprehension test reflect the ability to understand short, gra mmatically dense sentences. To measure full language comprehension, one should i deally measure comprehension of words, clauses, longer utterances and inferenc ing skills. The reading comprehension test was norm-referenced for the students with NH. The results from students with HL could be compared to the referenc e group, but high scores were expected. Thus, the test may not have identified al l students with reading difficulties. Intervention effects can be measured in many ways. Here, they w ere measured by text quality, which may in turn be measured in different ways. Holistic text quality ratings based on benchmarking texts have been used in earlier o bservational learning studies and have been validated with sufficient inter- rater reliability (Tillema et al., 2012). This was also found in the present stud ies. When the research resulting in this dissertation started there was no appropriate existing self-efficacy scale for narrative writing fitting the criteria suggested by Bandura (2006). A scale by Braaksma and colleagues was used as a point of departure when developing the scale. When adapting the scale, o ne change was to use a VAS scale instead of writing down a number. This was to m ake the scale easier to understand for a younger age group. A Swedish self-efficacy scale for reading and writing was available (Wolff, 2010). The statements in Wolf f's scale were answered by choosing one of four options and they did not begin with \"I can...\" (as the statements in the present dissertation do). It was thus not an appropriate scale according to Bandura's guidelines (2006). It may have lower pre dictive value than answering \"I can\"-statements by marking a VAS scale or writing a number 0-100. The self-efficacy scale for writing (SEWS) was not published wh en the scale in this project was being developed but might have been an alternative (Bruning et al., 2013b). However, self-efficacy should be measured in relation t o the skill in question, and comparisons between studies may be difficult to d o. A possible drawback of how the scale was presented, i.e. by the researcher s performing the intervention is that students may have been prone to marking th e scales more positively than if the scale had b een distributed differently. Finally, the linear mixed effects model (LME) is commonly used in studies with repeated measures including studies in education (Meteyard & Da vies, 2020), speech-language pathology (Quen\u00e9 & van den Bergh, 2004) and med icine (Casals et al., 2014). Despite its usefu lness, there are concerns about how to report analysis for replicability (Meteyard & Davies, 2020). ANOVA was used in Paper III as there was less data to consider. The number of participants in Paper II was small, and the group heterogeneous. This is a recurring issue in clinical grou ps. Looking closer at 63 the characteristics of those who do well and those who struggle may be one way of studying effects qualitatively in a heterogeneous group (Marsch ark & Hauser, 2008). Therefore, Paper III described the students with the hig hest and lowest text quality ratings. Future directions The results in the present dissertation raise some questions ab out the role of observational learning for writing in elementary school. Furthe r studies are needed to explore a range of issues such as the optimal length of an i ntervention, whether more explicit instruction and f eedback on texts from teachers a nd peers could improve effects and whether intervention should be led by the t eacher or someone else. For students with HL, controlled effect studies of observ ational learning are called for. Students' development of adequate writing skills takes time, ef fort and motivation. Teaching methods must therefore be effective. The fact that pos itive effects of this structured five lesson intervention were found is important fro m an educational point of view, but only if students remember what they learned over time. An explanation for the lack of long-term effects may be that the i ntervention had too few lessons for students to recall what they learned without re visiting it later during the semester. Recurring elements of observation and reflection, or reinforcement by the teachers on what the students have learned, may make the st udents more prone to reflect on what other students do. An even closer collaborat ion with the schools during method development and preparations, for example focus g roups with teachers may improve intervention lesson content and acceptance in the schools even more. Working closely with the school has been found an ef fective approach for improving outcomes but it requires considerable time from t he teachers and support from school management (Ebbels et al., 2019; van Schaik et al., 2019). The observational learning paradigm may in future studies be co mbined with other structured instruction methods. Feedback is one recurring effec tive element of writing intervention (Graham & Harris, 2018) and may be seen pa rtly as social persuasion which also may increase self-efficacy (Bandura, 1997). Receivi ng feedback by observing the effects on a reader is another way of improving text quality, as shown by Couzijn (1999) and Rijlaarsdam et al. (200 8). The students could observe peers who read and react to the students' texts. Self-efficacy for writing and other aspects of motivation may b e further explored for research and as an educational tool. Observational learning intervention may affect motivation differently depending on whether and how stud ents identify with film peers. Self-efficacy has so metimes been found to decrease over time, for example in transitions such as changing schools (Schunk & Meece , 2006). 64 There may be intervention effects in the writing process which are not detectable in text quality ratings. Writing processes can be measured with ke ystroke logging data on for example pauses and revisions. Data from the master's the sis on students with NH in Grade 5 (described in Method development) show that after intervention, some students used less time for pauses (Hammarstedt & Karan, 2 016). Further, some of the students made a higher proportion of deep revisions (e.g. finding synonyms) relative to superficial revisions (e.g. correcting ty pos) after intervention. The authors also showed that deep revision was not always linke d to higher text quality ratings. Emergent improving strategies are thus not alw ays apparent in a finished text. Future studies on observational learning interve ntion should therefore explore effects on writing processes. 65 Conclusions This dissertation aimed at developing and evaluating an observa tional learning intervention and a self-efficacy scale for supporting narrative writing in elementary school students with NH and with HL. The intervention was well received by the students and could be implemented in Grade 5 for students with NH and in Grades 5-8 for students with HL. For students with NH, there were posi tive effects of intervention on narrative text quality but the effects were not sustained. Students with higher scores on reading comprehension had more benefit fr om the intervention. For students with HL, text quality ratings did no t increase. The students with HL with the highest text quality ratings were you nger at amplification than the students with HL with t he lowest ratings, indicating t hat early diagnosis and intervention promotes literacy development. Gender was the most important predictor of text quality for all students. Self-efficacy ratin gs (students with NH) were stable between different statements and increased after in tervention, indicating that the observational learning intervention increased the stud ents' beliefs in their capabilities. This dissertation has demonstrated that an observational learni ng intervention for writing and a corresponding self-efficacy scale could be develo ped and implemented in Swedish elementary school classes for students w ith NH in Grade 5 and for students with HL in Grades 5-8, as a result of carefu l planning and development partly in collabora tion with schools. It was possib le to do so in line with the Swedish curriculum and to adapt it to students' school grade and age. The observational learning intervention had a positive effect o n text quality for students with NH. The students with higher reading comprehensio n scores had a stronger effect of intervention. Students who are better reader s often read more and may thus have more experience of narrative texts. Young student s and other students who have less reading experience may benefit from more explicit instruction methods than was offered in the observational learning interven tion in the studies described in this dissertation. Observational learning may comp lement other strategy instruction and other structured writing interventions supporting young writers. The positive effects of intervention were not sustained over ti me. Measuring effects over time is important in intervention research (Graham & Harri s, 2014). The reinforcement of new skills may be important for sustained effe cts, especially for 66 students with poorer language skills. For the students with HL with the lowest text quality ratings i.e. the boys in both Grade 5-6 and Grade 7-8, text quality ratings were lower for texts written at follow-up than the earlier text s, although the effect was not statistically significant. The students with HL wrote t he follow-up text after summer vacation. This supports research which has found that st udents with weak language skills are more at risk for \"summer loss\" of language skills after a long vacation (Cooper et al., 1996). There were no indications, when individual cases were inspected , that more severe HL was associated with poorer text quality or text quality chan ges. This corroborates earlier studies of HL and language skills & Tharpe, 2008; Yoshinaga-Itano et al., 1998 ). On the contrary, some students with profound HL received some of the highest tex t quality ratings. These students had been diagnosed with HL earlier than the stud ents with the lowest text quality ratings. A conclusi on of this could be that the qu ality and quantity of linguistic input for children w ith HL influences language skill s years later. The results thus underline the importance of early diagnosis of HL for optimal audiological, linguistic and pedagogical support. Cognitive and linguistic factors , which were measured with test s of WM capacity, language comprehension and reading comprehension, contributed t o some extent to text quality in students with NH. For students with HL, age (sc hool grade) influenced text quality. Performi ng the intervention in classes with slightly older students may result in stronger effects. Students with weaker W M , f o r e x a m p l e young students, may benefit from more explicit instruction than was offered in the observational learning intervention in the studies described in this dissertation. A greater number of lessons is another possible way to develop th e method further. Observational learning may complement other strategy instructio n methods and other structured writing interventions supporting young writers . Gender is an important factor influencing writing, shown by the fact that girls with NH and with HL received higher text quality ratings than boys d id. Despite this, boys had similar self-efficacy to girls with NH. The boys in th is study may have had self-efficacy beliefs for writing which were slightly too high for optimal development (Bandura, 1997). Kn owledge about students' self-eff icacy ought to be of high interest for teachers. Writing motivation may increase by observing and identifying with models. Self-efficacy scales should be adapted for the specific context, taking age differences , educational systems, and genre into account. Whether teaching students with, or at risk for LD or not, the s aying 'one size does not fit all' must be emphasized. Thus, adapting, evidence-basin g and implementing new teaching practices as well as evidence-basing current metho ds is important in improving the teaching of writi ng and strengthening language ou tcomes. To implement new evidence-based instruction methods in the classro om setting, school management should provide teachers with plenty of support and t ime for planning 67 and collaboration with the prof essionals who are introducing th e methods (Ebbels et al., 2019; Markussen-Brown et al., 2017 van Schaik et al., 2 019). For sustained effects in groups who have or are at risk for LD, continuous su pport after initial implementation is needed (Ebbels et al., 2019). The continuous support of students' writing development is a question of facilitating their academi c achievement in school and their participation in and contribution to a sustain able society. 69 Tack Ett stort tack till er som har gjort detta i lektionerna och till era v\u00e5rdnadshavare som har hj\u00e4lpt till med information.

We explore e ects of a ve lesson intervention series based on peer observation. Fifty- ve Swedish 5th-grade students aged 10 -12 years followed this intervention programme. The students watched short lm clips with peers working with texts. Each lesson was organised according to a theme: reader 's perception of the text, ordering of events, how to begin a story, how to end a story and how to edit a text. The students wrote four texts during the intervention. The quality of these texts was assessed by a panel of trained raters. Additionally, the language and reading comprehension and working memory capacity were tested. The results show that average text quality had signi cantly improved at the end of the intervention, and that this improvement was modulated by reading and language com- prehension. Three months later, however, text quality was signi - cantly decreased.ARTICLE HISTORY Received 5 June 2018 Accepted 3 October 2018 KEYWORDS Observational learning; personal narratives; writing improvement; intervention; elementary education; intervention for writing Introduction Background to the study Good writing skills are more important than ever before in today 's society. To quote Deborah Brandt ( 2015 , p. 3): \"For perhaps the rst time in the history of mass literacy, writing seems to be eclipsing reading as the literate experience of consequence \". Writing pro ciency is not only a fundamental tool for educational achievements, it is also a key feature for success in professional and social life. Consequently, the training of writing skills in early years is necessary, and so is the development of good methods for improving writing skills for students at di erent levels in the school system. During recent years, the results of international comparative studies of students ' achievements (PISA, PIRLS) have suggested that literacy skills (notably reading compre- hension) in Swedish children are declining (Skolverket, 2016 ). In addition, there have been requests for methods of writing instruction that target the needs of speci c populations, for instance, children with hearing impairment. In response to these CONTACT Emily Grenner emily.grenner@med.lu.se Department of Logopedics, Phoniatrics and Audiology, University hospital, Lund, SwedenEDUCATIONAL REVIEW https://doi.org/10.1080/00131911.2018.1536035 \u00a9 2018 Educational Review This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/ ), which permits non-commercial re-use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited, and is not altered, transformed, or built upon in any way.developments, this study was carried out as part of a larger project. In this study, the method of observational learning (e.g. Raedts, van Steendam, Grez, Hendrickx, & Masui, 2017 ; Rijlaarsdam et al., 2008 ) was implemented as an intervention programme to improve narrative writing in 11-year-olds ( fth graders). Observational learning has repeatedly been shown to be a successful method for the improvement of writing skills. For this reason, we tested it with a group of hearing students, the results of which we report here. There are no well-established guidelines for writing education in Sweden, and therefore we do not evaluate observational learning against another method. In a future study, we will also report on how the method worked with students with hearing impairment of comparable age. Writing education Writing development in 11 -16 year-olds has been studied less than writing in younger children, or students at higher education (Myhill, 2009 ). The studies of the linguistic development in this age range are, according to Myhill ( 2008 , p. 403), \"patchy \", and there is no comprehensive understanding of how language and writing develop during these years. The writing of 11-year-olds \"continues to be in fluenced by their oral and reading experiences and their social experiences and emotional development \"(Myhill, 2008 , p. 403). The variation in lexical choice and sentence structures continue to develop over the school years (e.g. Myhill, 2008 ). A recurrent nding is that girls are better writers than boys. Kanaris ( 1999 ), for instance, examined the writing of children 8 to 10 years of age and reported that texts written by girls were generally longer, more complex, and more focused on description and elaboration than boys 'texts. In Sweden, the school curriculum de nes which knowledge the children should have acquired by the end of some, but not all grades, for instance grade 3 and grade 6. For this study, the knowledge required by the end of grade 3 is especially interesting, since that is the last certain checkpoint for the children in our study. Here we nd that writing of narrative texts is one of the central objectives for grades 1 -3( a g e7 -9; Skolverket, 2016 , pp. 260 -261), while those for grades 4 -6 are that students broaden their repertoire of knowledge about texts and text production, and learn to adapt the structure and linguistic features typical for other genres, notably descriptions, instructions, argumentative texts, expository texts, advertisements, and letters to the editor. Students should further learn not only di erent ways of processing and revising the form and content of their own texts, but also to give feedback on texts written by others. In addition, the curriculum states that they should learn how to write by hand and on the computer, and how to organise and edit a text. The linguistic structures they should master include subordinate clauses, parts-of- speech, morphology, spelling rules, punctuation, and cohesion (Skolverket, 2016 ,p p . 260 -262). We can thus expect that the teaching for the children in this study is occupied with the topics above, and the knowledge in this area will be assessed against the criteria in the curriculum by the end of grade six. However, the curriculum does not provide teachers with any speci cations regarding teaching strategies and methods that can be used to obtain the goals in the curriculum; instead, the teachers are free to choose among methods and didactic choices that are available to them. Generally, through teacher education, and practice, teachers have experienced methods sprung from a socio-cultural perspective, which has emphasised, for example, the importance of exposing children to good literacy2 E. GRENNER ET AL.practices, through exposure to a variety of genres to develop deeper knowledge about domain-speci c language, and encouraging them to form an identity as readers and writers (cf. Lundgren, S\u00e4lj\u00f6, & Liberg, 2010 ). At the same time, however, the curriculum does not provide teachers with any speci cations regarding strategies and methods that can be used to obtain the goals in the curriculum. The teachers are free to choose among methods and didactic choices they are familiar with. Which of these strategies are most common in Swedish schools has not been studied systematically. However, the need for better practices in writing skills have been highlighted through the Swedish National Agency for Education 's initiative, an ongoing (2015 -2018) nation-wide project with the aim to promote good teaching practices. This initiative has provided Swedish teachers with many new approaches to teaching in the literacy eld, targeting speci c areas, such as early writing development, or domain-speci c language. Against this background, we recognise a need for developing targeted and informed teaching methods in the area of writing for this age group in Sweden. With this study, we want to contribute with a method and a design that has not previously been applied as a teaching method in Sweden. Eective models of writing education Supporting students 'writing skills is considered to be of high priority in education. However, the practices of teaching writing di er considerably between countries, and there are substantial di erences in the time allotted for teachers 'writing instruction and practicing writing (Graham & Rijlaarsdam, 2016 ). One recurrent theme in the education of writing is that observing models is a successful strategy. This model can be a teacher (Harris, Graham, & Mason, 2006 ) but is typically a peer, i.e. a student of similar age and level as the observer (Fidalgo, Torrance, & Garc\u00eda, 2008 ). This strategy has been implemented in the observational learning paradigm, and has been applied to writing instruction in many previous studies (e.g. Braaksma, Rijlaarsdam, & van den Bergh, 2018 ; Raedts, Rijlaarsdam, & \u00c5kerlund, Johansson, & Sahl\u00e9n, 2018 ). Learning through observation is not just imitating (Bandura, 1997 ). It requires several higher-order cognitive activities: attention, retention, production and motivation. Observers must pay attention to the crucial details in a model 's actions, and store them in memory for future use (retention). Further, observers must be able to implement, coordinate and reproduce the new skills that were learned from the model, and be motivated (e.g. identify the need and have the grit) to reproduce them. The evidence for the e ectiveness of observational learning in writing is growing and dierent genres have been studied. For example, Couzijn ( 1999 ) investigated the di erence between \"learning by doing \"and \"learning by observation \"in a sample of 120 Dutch students 'argumentative writing. The group that was trained using observational learning outperformed the other group, which suggests that observation is more bene cial than practice-only methods for complicated tasks such as writing and reading. The e ectiveness of peers as models was demonstrated by Hillocks ( 1986 ) who found larger e ect sizes when feedback came from peers, rather than from teachers. The same principle is applied in collaborative learning (Graham & Perin, 2007 ). Rijlaarsdam et al. (2008 ) state that instructions must aim to stimulate students 'learning-to-write capacities in order to enhance their possibilities to observe and evaluate relevant processes involved in text composition. These processes are part of the seminal, cognitive models of writing byEDUCATIONAL REVIEW 3Hayes and Flower ( 1980 ) and Hayes ( 1996 ) and include planning, translating and reviewing, reading and focusing on the reader, and communication processes between writers and readers. Many of these processes are automatically incorporated when watching someone else producing or re flecting on a text, which explains part of the strength of the observa- tional learning paradigm in the education of writing (Rijlaarsdam et al., 2008 ). Additionally, learners who watch someone else successfully perform a task may become motivated to try the same task themselves (Raedts et al., 2006 ). Three factors have been identi ed that explain the advantage of observational learning compared to performative training (Braaksma, Rijlaarsdam, van den Bergh, & van Hout-Wolters, 2004 ). The rst is that watching models think aloud while performing writing tasks in real-time triggers \"slumbering powers in the observing students to perform such orchestration as well \"(Braaksma et al., 2004 , p. 3). The second is that the observing students do not write during the observational learning, so that their cognitive resources can be fully allocated to the observation. In doing this, the students can focus on the learning aspect, instead of the writing aspect (cf. Rijlaarsdam et al., 2008 ). The third is that observational learning students are stimulated to use observa- tion, re flection and evaluation which helps them gain information that changes their knowledge. This reconceptualising and re-evaluating behaviour can be used in new writing tasks, and is, therefore, one reason why text quality aspects have been shown to increase after an intervention with observational learning. Writing intervention with observational learning has been adapted for di erent ages, school subjects and genres. The evaluation of these studies has typically been based on the assessment of text quality before and after intervention. Some examples are argu- mentative writing in 10th grade students (de Smet, 2014 ), weak and strong writers of argumentative texts in 8th grade (Braaksma, Rijlaarsdam, & van den Bergh, 2002 ), argumentative writing in 9th grade (Braaksma et al., 2004 ; Couzijn, 1999 ), argumentative text writing in rst year university students (Raedts et al., 2006 ), elementary school students 'strategies for writing and organising text structure (Bouwer & Koster, 2016 ), and argumentative text writing in university students with and without hearing impair- ment (van de Weijer et al., 2018 ). Aims and motivation for this study This study has two main aims. First, we examine whether the quality of written narrative texts in 10 -12 year-old secondary school students can be improved through training according to the observational learning paradigm and, if so, whether such e ects are lasting. Second, we ask if intervention e ects, if any, are dependent on the students ' individual predispositions. The positive e ects of observational learning on writing performance have been established in a variety of studies, some of which were men- tioned above. It is, however, unclear whether variability in the students 'predispositions may explain some of the variation found in the e ectiveness of the learning paradigm. The predispositions that we measured were working memory capacity, language com- prehension, reading comprehension, and gender. The focus on narrative writing in this study is motivated by research showing that the establishment of narratives is not only a prerequisite for the development of other genres, such as expository or argumentative structures, but also for results during higher education4 E. GRENNER ET AL.studies (Feagans & Appelbaum, 1986 ). The schema of a narrative is being learned in typically developing preschool children (Karmilo -Smith, 1981 ), and is well established in children around nine years of age (Nordqvist Palviainen, 2001 ; Berman & Slobin, 1994 ; Westby & Culatta, 2016 ). Consequently, 11-year-old students (our target group) are expected to be aware of the structure of a narrative text but their ability to write such a text is still under development. This was demonstrated by Johansson ( 2009 ), who investi- gated genre development in narrative and expository texts from 10 years up to adulthood. Working memory capacity is not often measured in writing studies that investigate observational learning (but see van de Weijer et al., 2018 ), but it has been identi ed as a crucial component for the simultaneous coordination of linguistic and cognitive activ- ities in writing, and it is important for the retrieval and structuring of procedural and episodic information from long-term memory (McCutchen, 2011 ). When lower level processes, such as the transcription, have been automatised, a writer can make cognitive space available for the engagement in higher-level processes (Fayol, Hupet, & Largy, 2015 ) further suggests that tran- scription skills of children of the same age as those in this study play a role in the ability to coordinate actions during writing. Likewise, the ability to produce oral narratives correlates with language comprehension (Blom & Boerma, 2016 ; Reuterski\u00f6ld, Hansson, & Sahl\u00e9n, 2011 ) and general school performance. Reading comprehension is another factor in writing development and has been shown to be associated with working memory capacity (Sahl\u00e9n, Hansson, Ibertsson, & Reuterski\u00f6ld, 2004 ). The eects of writing instruction using observational learning are generally positive, but are limited to students at higher education, pr imarily writing argumentative or expository texts. Therefore, we ask whether we observe similar bene cial eects in a younger age group, writing a narrative text, and whether these e ects persist a period of time after the interven- tion. Additionally, it is an unexplored issue whether some of the variability in these e ects can be explained on the basis of students 'individual predispositions related to writing perfor- mance. Therefore, we explore whether the e ects of our intervention are modulated by the students 'gender, working memory capacity, and their reading and language comprehension. To summarise, in this study we hope to provide answers to the following research questions: RQ (1) Does text quality improve as a consequence of the intervention? RQ (2) Do any e ects last? RQ (3) Can working memory capacity, language comprehension, reading comprehension, or gender predict text quality or intervention e ects? Method Participants Six schools in a school district in the south of Sweden were initially asked to participate in the study. Two schools in areas of similar socioeconomic status accepted. There were a total of 79 students in four classes (two in each school), 35 and 44 in the two schools, respectively. All students who took part in ordinary whole-class activities were consid- ered suitable candidates for the study.1Informed consent was received from 59 (34 plusEDUCATIONAL REVIEW 525) students and their parents. Four of these were subsequently excluded because they missed more than one intervention lesson or had too limited knowledge of Swedish. This reduced the participant group to 55 students, 32 and 23 from each school; 29 of them were girls, 26 were boys. Their average age was 11;2 (years;months) (range 10;9 - 11;9). For an overview of the participants, see Table 1 . The students 'cognitive and linguistic predispositions were measured with standardised or norm-referenced tasks of language comprehension, reading comprehension and verbal working memory capacity (see also Table 1 ). Working memory capacity was measured with a 36-items subset from a standardised \";W o l,2010 ). The task has a process component consisting of answering general knowledge yes-or-no- questions, and a recall component consisting of remembering letters. Language compre- hension was measured with the Test for Reception of Grammar-2 (TROG-2), adapted for Swedish (Bishop, 2009 ). This task consists of 80 sentences that need to be matched with one of four corresponding images. In an ordinary one-to-one situation, a researcher or a clinician reads the sentences and the child points to the corresponding image in a booklet. In our study, the task was administered in the classroom. The images were projected on a screen, and the students marked the matching picture in a booklet. Reading comprehension, nally, was assessed by the SL40 (Magnusson & Naucl\u00e9r, 2010 ). This task is used to assess written sentence comprehension. The maximum possible score is 40 points. Student outcomes on each of these three tasks and expected values for this target group are displayed in Table 1 . Most, but not all, students scored within the normal range, but, not unexpectedly, there were some students with poor values (i.e. more than two standard deviations below the norm) on each of the three tasks. More speci cally, there were seven students who had low working-memory scores, one of whom also had a low score on the language comprehen- sion task, and two of whom also had low scores on reading comprehension. These seven students were more or less evenly distributed over the four classes. No students performed low on all three tasks. The scores on the working memory task correlated moderately with those on language comprehension ( r= 0.50) and on reading comprehension ( r=0 . 5 0 ) .T h e correlation between the scores on reading comprehension and language comprehension was less strong ( r= 0.22). The relatively large size of these correlation coe cients, was without doubt, due to the above-mentioned seven students whose scores were well below those of the remaining students. Intervention We developed a series of ve peer observation lessons, designed to improve narrative writing. In each lesson, several short video clips were presented showing unknown Table 1.

The students in the lm clips were of comparable age as the observers and had varying levels of writing skills. This was a deliberate choice, in the hope that the participants in the study would recognise the topics and the writing problems that were discussed in the videos, and would nd a peer to identify with amongst the students in the lm clips. This recognition has been shown to be a determining feature in learning from peers (Graham & Perin, 2007 ; Rijlaarsdam et al., 2008 ). Video peers were recorded alone or in pairs in a lab environment. Interesting sequences on di erent levels and on a variety of topics were selected as intervention material. During the making of the clips, the students were regularly encouraged by the researchers to \"think out loud \"while they performed di erent reading and writing activities. This was done to allow for insights into their thoughts and reasoning when reading someone else 's text, suggesting improvements, or while writing their own texts. This design was inspired by Braaksma et al. ( 2004 ). Each lesson was centred around one of ve writing themes, respectively: (1) the reader 's perception: What does the reader nd important in a story?; (2) structure: dierent ways to start a story; In what order should the events unfold?; (3) conclusion: How does one nish a story?; (4) editing someone else 's text; (5) editing during writing: What changes do writers make while they write? Each of these themes is listed as target skills in the curriculum for grades 4 -6 (Skolverket, 2016 ). During the lessons, the students were divided into groups of two to six students. The topic of the lesson was always rst introduced by one of the researchers. Then, the students were asked to watch four to six short (no longer than two minutes) lm clips related to this topic, and to re flect on the things they agreed or disagreed with (\"observation stage \"). After each clip, the students discussed the videos in pairs or in groups, guided by the researchers ( \"reflection stage \"). After having watched and dis- cussed all the clips, students within each group summarised and shared their re flections with those in the other groups. At the end of each lesson, the students wrote down what they had learnt ( \"learning stage \"). They formulated these learning outcomes in the form of \"advice for next year 's grade 5 students \". The contents of the lessons were structured and scripted in advance, to ensure replicability in all four classes. All lessons were coordinated by the same two researchers, one who guided the conversations and one who took notes and administered the presentation of the lm clips. More details on the intervention are provided in the Appendix .The intervention focused on narrative writing, and, consequently, narrative texts written by the students were used as an instrument of assessing the outcome of the intervention. During the course of the intervention programme, each student wrote four texts about one of the following four topics: (1) Write about one time when you were saved from a jam you had got into, or when you saved somebody else from a jam ; (2) Write about one time when you were hurt; (3) Write about one time when you were afraid ; (4) Write about one time when you made somebody happy . Topics 1 and 3 have been used before, and were found suitable for the age group (Johansson, 2009 ; Str\u00f6mqvist, 1996 ). Topics 2 and 4 were new for this study, and chosen to be similarly easy to write about. Students wrote their texts on a laptop using a keystroke logging program (Frid, Johansson, Johansson, & Wengelin, 2014 ) resembling a basic word processing interface. The nal texts were also converted to CHAT format for automatic analysis of lexical text characteristics (MacWhinney, 2000 ).EDUCATIONAL REVIEW 7Study design The design of the study (illustrated in Figure 1 ) was partially determined by methodo- logical considerations, and partially by practical constraints. Students of one of the two schools had the observational learning intervention rst and regular lessons second, while those of the other school had regular lessons rst, and the observational learning intervention second (cross-over design). In this design, students are \"their own controls \" as two classes cross from intervention to regular lessons (and the other two classes cross from regular lessons to intervention). For ethical reasons, we did not include a school to gather data but not implement the education, as observational learning has been shown to be an e ective method for developing written language. The intervention and full data collection (excluding the follow-up) took 13 weeks in total, which is short in comparison to many other intervention programmes. We chose this relatively short period so that the programme could be completed within a single term. We also chose that the intervention would take place in the children 's natural environment, i.e. their own classroom, to maximise the study 's generalisability (Graham & Harris, 2014 ). During the rst week, all students wrote the rst narrative text, and performed the working memory capacity task and the language comprehension task. After week 1, the students from the two schools followed di erent paths. Students from one school attended the ve intervention lessons during weeks 3 -5 (i.e. relatively early during the intervention period), while those from the other school attended these lessons during weeks 8 -9 (i.e. relatively late during the intervention period). In week 6, all students wrote their second narrative text, which was after the intervention lessons for students from one of the two schools, and before the intervention lessons for students from the other school. In week 11, all students wrote their third narrative text, and took the reading comprehension task. Nineteen weeks after the last intervention week, the students wrote, as a follow-up on the intervention, the fourth narrative text (cf. Stinner & Tennent, 2012 ). The tasks of working memory capacity, language comprehension and reading comprehen- sion were administered at two occasions in order not to exhaust the students. All tasks related to the intervention were administered by the researchers. The regular Swedish lessons that took part during the period of \"regular lessons \"were given by the students 'own teachers. During these lessons, the teachers were explic itly asked not to focus on writing instruction. Figure 1. Schematic overview of the intervention programme in the two schools.

GRENNER ET AL.Text quality Text quality can be described through di erent aspects, such as grammatical and lexical features, text organisation, or reader adaptation (Schriver, 1989 ;M c N a m a r a ,C r o s s l e y ,& McCarthy, 2010 ), and there is no universally used method to judge text quality. The Swedish school system does not provide any set criteria or reference texts that can be used for assessment in this age group. In this study, text quality was assessed on the basis of benchmark texts, i.e. example texts comparable to the ones written by the students, which were given low- to high-quality ratings together with a motivation for the given ratings. This method has also been used in other writing intervention studies using observa- tional learning (see Raedts et al., 2017 ), and has been tested and validated by Tillema, van den Bergh, Rijlaarsdam, and Sanders ( 2012 ). Six university students were trained to assess text quality on a scale from 0 to 100. During the training, the raters were given four benchmark texts rated 25, 40, 50 and 95, together with a motivation for each of these ratings. The four benchmark texts had been written by children from a comparable age group on similar topics, and had been collected earlier during a pilot study. The motivations for the ratings of the benchmark texts were based on aspects of genre, structure, organisation, punctua- tion, grammar, spelling, text length and content. They could be positive (e.g. \"Punctuation is well used and sentences are well-formed \") or negative (e.g. \"The text feels un nished and is di cult to understand for a reader \"). During their training, the raters rated six new texts accordingly, that is, with a higher rating if they considered a text better than one of the benchmark texts, or lower when they considered it worse. The texts collected during the intervent ion period were assigned at random to the six raters with the restrictions that each text was rated three times, that texts written by one student would be rated by di erent raters, and that each rater would rate texts from before, as well as after, the intervention lessons. All raters were told that the topics of the texts varied, but they did not know that one and the same person had produced more than one text, or in which order the texts were written, nor that the texts were part of an intervention study. The raters were told to take into consideration that the children who had written the texts were between 10 and 13 years old, and that the texts were written during 30 minutes on a computer without access to an automatic spell checker. Analyses The analysis focuses on the intervention e ect, and whether or not this e ect was modulated by any of the students 'cognitive or linguistic predisposit ions. The intervention appeared in both schools, although at di erent times. The students came from four di erent classes from two schools. The two schools were comparab le with each other, and so were the classes within the schools. The data were structured hierarchically, and a mixed-e ects regression analysis was performed on the data. The outcome variable was text quality, i.e. the ratings given to the texts by the six raters. Since each text was rated by three raters and each student wrote four texts, there were 12 quality ratings fo r most students. Students, school classes, and raters were added as random e ects. Students were nested within the four classes. RatersEDUCATIONAL REVIEW 9were crossed with the students. Intervention was the main predictor of interest, and was coded with three levels: before intervention (i.e. text 1 for one of the two schools and texts 1 and 2 for the other school), after intervention (i.e. texts 2 and 3 for one of the schools, and text 3 for the other school), and follow-up (text 4 for both schools). Additionally, the following predictors were considered: the students 'cognitive and linguistic predispositions (i.e. working memory capacity, reading comprehension, and language comprehension), and student gender. These latter four variables were adde d in order to establish whether any of them interacted with the e ect of intervention, and to establish whether intervention would still have an e ect after the e ects of the other predictors had been partialled out. Since regression outputs normally show predicted est imates at zero-values of the predictors, the values of the non-categorical pr edictors (i.e. working memory ca pacity, language comprehen- sion and reading comprehension) were centred at their medians (cf. Table 1 ) so that inter- pretation of the regression coe cients for these variables would be the predicted text quality for students with median scores on each of the variables. The intervention predictor was contrast-coded such that the regression coe cients for this predictor corresponded to the dierence between pre- and post-intervention, an d between post-intervention and follow-up, respectively (repeated contrasts). The analysi s was done in R (version 3.4.3, R core team, 2017) using the package lme4 (Bates et al. 2015 ). Results Descriptive data of text quality A total of 221 texts were written by the students. Three of them wrote only three texts, all the others wrote four. The texts were, for the most part, form focused, and linear in structure, i.e. they merely stated events as they occurred, and did not di erentiate background from foreground. This is rather typical for texts produced in this age group. The texts varied in length from 14 to 340 words, 2 to 66 clauses, which, on average, is shorter than written narratives from comparable age groups collected in other studies (Johansson, 2009 ; Walld\u00e9n & \u00c5kerlund, 2008 ). One likely cause of this di erence is that participants in these other studies wrote texts in a lab setting (supervised by the experiment leader), while the students in this study wrote texts in the classroom setting. We did not quite succeed in receiving exactly three ratings per text. The quality of 209 texts was rated by three raters (our target number); that of the remaining 10 texts was rated by one (1), two (8) or four (1) raters. This brought the total number of ratings to 648. The ratings varied along almost the entire scale with a minimum value of 1 and a maximum value of 93 out of the possible 100 points. The ratings were highly correlated with text length ( r= 0.81): shorter texts received lower ratings than longer texts. This nding is consistent with that of other studies on the text quality within this age group (Malvern, Richards, Chipere, & Dur\u00e1n, 2004 ), and presumably contributed to the fact that the inter-rater reliability (calculated on the averages of the per-text ratings) was high: Cronbach 's alpha = 0.90. Figure 2 shows how the ratings were distributed across the four texts within the four classes (labelled A to D in the gure). The gure shows that the values were positively skewed (i.e. relatively more values at the lower end of the scale), and that a few cases were considered outliers, marked as single dots above the whiskers. Furthermore, the10 E. GRENNER ET AL.variability between the four classes was larger than that within the four classes. In itself, this is an interesting observation, as it implies that student achievements are not only determined by individual predispositions, but also by external factors. Most extreme ratings, on average, were obtained in classes B (highest) and C (lowest). The e ect of intervention on text quality is indicated in the gure by the colour of the boxes (i.e. dark grey is pre-intervention, light grey is post intervention or follow-up). Also here, there appears to be relatively large variability between the four classes. In classes A and B, text 2, written directly after the intervention, received higher ratings than texts written directly before it. This was not the case for text 3 in classes C and D. Intervention e ects and interactions Two choices were made for the selection of the nal regression model. The rst choice concerned the components (subject, school class, rater), and the structure (random intercepts or random slopes) of the random e ects of the model. We compared models with di erent random e ect structures using likelihood ratio tests. The best structure had random slopes for subjects, and random intercepts for raters and school class. In other words, all three random predictors contributed with non-zero variances to the data. There were di erences in intercept due to classroom and to raters. The school class dierences can be observed in Figure 2 , which shows, for instance, that the ratings for therst texts written by the students in class D received lower ratings than those written by students from the other classes. Since the same protocol was followed in all classes at all times, we have no explanation for this variation.1234 1234 1234 1234020406080100 TextQuality ratingABCD Figure 2. Boxplots of text quality ratings in the four classes. Classes A and B are from the school with intervention rst (between texts 1 and 2), and classes C and D are from the school with intervention second (between texts 2 and 3).EDUCATIONAL REVIEW 11The second choice concerned the structure of the xed e ects (gender, working memory capacity, language comprehension, reading comprehension). Several regression models (including the random e ects structure described above) were considered, ranging from a model without any predictor e ects to a complex one with all two- way interactions of the four predictors and intervention, including all logically possible models intermediate between these two. The models were compared on the basis of their predictive accuracy (corrected AIC values, cf. Long, 2012 ). The one ranked as the best (i.e. having the lowest corrected AIC value) contained main e ects of gender and working memory capacity and interaction e ects of intervention with language com- prehension and with reading comprehension. A summary of this model is given in Table 2 , and described below. We note that the second-best tting model (with an AIC value that was only slightly di erent from the best) contained the interaction of intervention with working memory capacity instead of language comprehension. We mention this because the discussion below is focused on the interaction between intervention and language comprehension, but given the observed correlation between language comprehension and working memory capacity, we could have focused on the interaction of intervention and working memory capacity instead. The column labelled \"Estimates \",u n d e rt h eb l o c k \"Fixed e ects \"inTable 2 , shows the estimated e ects of the predictors. The rst estimate, labelled \"Intercept \", is the predicted text quality before the intervention for an \"average \" student (i.e. a student with a median score on the tasks of working memory capacity, reading comprehension and la nguage comprehension, and whose gender is unknown). The value is about 33 points. The amount of variability in the inter- cept due to the random predictors is provided in the block \"Random e ects \".T h e Table 2. Regression output.

Signi cant predictors are those with an absolute t-value larger than 2.12 E. GRENNER ET AL.variability due to subject is largest (appro ximately 11 points), while the variability due to classroom and rater was around four points. The estimate of the intervention e ect is given on the second row of the table. The value is a bit over six points, which, once more, is the estimated intervention e ect for the same average student. The t-value indicates that this e ect is signi cant. The second intervention e ect is negative and indicates that the estimated text quality of the follow- up texts was signi cantly lower by approximately four points than that of the texts written after the intervention. The next two rows in the table indicate how text quality was a ected by gender and working memory capacity. Student gender had a particularly large e ect: girls wrote texts that were rated more than 12 points higher than boys. Working memory capacity had a positive e ect. The predicted text quality for two students with minimum and maximum working memory capacity (cf. Table 1 ) are 18.1 and 34.5, respectively. The next two e ects of language and reading comprehension are simple main e ects. They indicate that texts from before the intervention written by students who scored high on these tasks were somewhat better than those written by students with low scores. Neither of these two e ects is signi cant, however. The last four rows in the table indicate how the e ect of intervention was modulated by the language comprehension and working memory capacity. The two estimates of intervention with language comprehension are both negative. They indicate that stu- dents with higher scores on the language comprehension task improved less after the intervention and were worse at the follow up than students with lower scores. In other words, students with a relatively poor language comprehension predisposition pro ted more from the intervention than students with relatively good language predisposition. This e ect, however, was not signi cant. A di erent pattern is observed for reading comprehension. The rst interaction term for reading comprehension is positive, indi- cating that students with high scores on the reading comprehension task improved more from the intervention than students with low scores. This e ect was clearly signicant. The second interaction term is negative, suggesting that students with higher reading scores deteriorate more than students with low scores. This last term was not signi cant, however. The e ects of the four predictors are shown in Figure 3 .T h i s gure shows the estimated values based on the output shown in Table 2 for selected values of the predictors. Each panel shows two speci c values of the individual predictors of interest: boys or girls (top left panel), low or high values (remaining three panels). The low and high values were chosen to be the lower and the upper boundary of the interquartile range of the variable. The exact values are given in Table 1 .T h e values of the three remaining predictors not shown in a panel were the medians in each case. The intervention is included in every panel. The two upper panels show the main e ects of gender and working memory capacity. The two lower panels show the interaction e ects of language and reading comprehension. The size of the reading e ect appears to be relatively small, which is caused by the fact that the interquartile range was only two points (cf. Table 1 ).EDUCATIONAL REVIEW 13Discussion In this study, we tested the e ect of a writing intervention programme based on the observational learning paradigm. The paradigm was applied to 10 -12-year-old students in grade 5 who wrote personal narrative texts about various topics. We found that the quality of texts written after the intervention was rated signi cantly higher than that of those written before the intervention (RQ 1). However, the improvement due to the intervention was not maintained when measured at a follow-up, three months after the intervention programme had ended. On the contrary, it had decreased signi cantly (RQ 2). In addition to the intervention e ect, we found that girls wrote better texts than boys, and students with high scores on the working memory task wrote better texts than those with low scores. Additionally, we found that students with high scores on the reading comprehension task pro ted more from the intervention than those with low1020304050 boys girlsgender 0 1020304050 low highworking memory pre post low highlanguage comprehension pre post follo wup1020304050 highreading comprehension Figure 3.

GRENNER ET AL.scores. Finally, we found that students with lower scores on the language comprehen- sion task pro ted more from the intervention than students with higher scores. This nal result, though, was not statistically signi cant (RQ 3). There was relatively large variability between the four school classes included in the sample. This variability concerned the overall quality of the texts written by students within each class and also the observed e ect of the intervention within each class. None of these classes, though, di ered from one another in any clearly observable respect. They were selected from two comparable public schools, and we did not see any indication that students within any of the four classes di ered from those in the other classes, at least not in the variables that we measured. In other words, the variation that was observed should be considered random variation due to factors that were not controlled in our study. The average quality of the texts written by the students was relatively low, and the eect of the intervention was modest. Nevertheless, some students appeared to bene t more from it than others. We found that students with high reading comprehension scores bene ted signi cantly more from the intervention than those with low scores. In the selected model, this was the only predictor that interacted signi cantly with the intervention. We did not observe a direct relationship between reading comprehension and text quality: Texts written before the intervention by students with high reading scores were not rated signi cantly higher than texts written by students with low reading scores. These two observations suggest that students who are good readers are not necessarily also good writers. It also demonstrates the necessity of good writing instructions in order to improve writing skills in these students. The second variable included in the selected statistical model, and which inter- acted with intervention, was language comprehension. The e ect of language com- prehension on writing intervention is tentative, since the coe cients were not signicant. The results suggest that children with high language comprehension scores gained less from the intervention and their scores at follow up went down more than those of students with low scores. We think that this nding deserves further investigation. It seems that, at the age range of our sample, language comprehension is far ahead of written language production. Children at this age can understand sentences more complex than they are likely to use in writing. Less extremely stated, even children with relatively poor language comprehension scores understand sentence constructions that are complex enough to constitute sentences in narrative writing. The other two predictors (gender and working memory capacity) did not interact signicantly with the intervention, but they both had relatively strong e ects on text quality. The gender e ect is not unexpected. In Sweden, 11-year-old girls, on average, have better linguistic and writing skills than boys of the same age, and, as a conse- quence, do better at school. The e ect of gender has been frequently observed in other studies as well (e.g. Kanaris, 1999 ), and several explanations of the e ect have been proposed, either related to overall maturity or to social expectations. There is ample evidence that working memory capacity plays a role in writing (e.g. McCutchen, 2011 ), especially for children who have not yet automatised lower-level writing skills, such as transcription (Drijbooms et al., 2015 ). Thus, the connection between working memory capacity and text quality is not an unexpected nding inEDUCATIONAL REVIEW 15our results. Children with better working memory capacity are able to write texts with better text quality, due to their increased capacity to coordinate processes during writing. The e ect of intervention was not modulated by working memory capacity in the statistical model that we selected, but it was in many other models that we considered. The results suggest that in future studies we must explore the correlation between working memory capacity, transcription skills, text length, and text quality. In addition, future development of interventions of this kind should perhaps more carefully consider aspects of working memory capacity in this age group. Many other studies using observational learning (cf. Raedts et al., 2017 ), have applied their interventions to older age groups, where basic lower-level writing processes, such as transcription, is, to a greater extent, automatised and established. The overall relapse that we observed at follow-up may be discouraging for the evaluation of the intervention design, and it calls for some rethinking of the value of a short intervention period, or of the content and focus of the intervention lessons. There are several possible reasons why the e ect was not lasting. The instructional method is not well known in Sweden, and unknown to the teachers of the schools that took part in the intervention. It is possible that the intervention e ect would have had a longer- lasting e ect if it was carried out under the supervision of the regular teachers. We have preliminary evidence that the intervention e ects of our lessons are larger when performed by teachers who were trained in the method (and who used the same scripted instructions, lm-clips and lesson design) instead of researchers (Hammarstedt & Karan, 2016 ), but we do not know now whether these e ects would also be longer lasting. We believe that including a follow-up constitutes one of the assets in our study, and that it represents a guiding factor to develop better methods for writing instruction. After further studies, observational learning may become a tool that can make up for the lack of standardised writing methods that currently exist in Sweden. Conclusion The study shows that it is possible to implement a short observational learning inter- vention for 10 -12 year-olds. The paradigm worked well as an educational tool for the improvement of narrative writing. Text quality improved, and this improvement was statistically signi cant in spite of large variation between the four classes that partici- pated in the study. Somewhat discouragingly, however, the e ects seemed to have disappeared three months after the end of the intervention. This suggests that writing education needs to be implemented into the school curriculum on a regular basis, something which, unfortunately, is not the case at present in the Swedish schools. Our results also suggest that individual cognitive and linguistic predisposition may interact with intervention e ects. We think that this is an interesting nding that warrants further investigation. As a rst step, this nding should be replicated. Next, the question needs to be asked why some students gain more from observational learning interven- tion than others, and nally, how the method can be adapted so that the student group who showed a comparably weak improvement can bene t more from an intervention than what they did in this study. We leave these questions for future research.16 E. GRENNER ET AL.Note 1.Following the advice from the regional ethics board (EPN dnr. 2013/270) no students were a priori excluded.

GRENNER ET AL.Paper IIRESEARCH ARTICLE Predictors of narrative text quality in students with hearing loss Emily Grennera, Joost van de Weijerb, Audiology, Lund University, Lund, Sweden;bLund University Humanities Lab, Lund University, Lund, Sweden;cCentre for Languages and Literature, Lund University, Lund, Sweden ABSTRACT Aim: Students with hearing loss (HL) often fall behind hearing peers in complex language tasks such as narrative writing. This study explored the effects of school grade, gender, cognitive and linguistic predisposition and audiological factors on narrative text quality in this target group. Method: Eleven students with HL in Grades 5 -6 and 7 -8( a g e1 2 -15) who took part in a writing inter- vention wrote four narrative texts over six months. A trained panel rated text quality. The effects ofthe students 'working memory capacity, language comprehension, reading comprehension, school grade and gender and the intervention were analyzed as a mixed-effects regression model. Audiological factors were considered separately.Results: The analysis showed that throughout the period, texts written by female students in Grade 7-8 received the highest text quality ratings, while those written by male students in Grade 7 -8 received the lowest ratings. There was no effect of the intervention, or of the linguistic and cognitive measures. The students with the lowest text quality ratings received amplification later than those with high ratings, but HL severity was not associated with text quality.Conclusion: Hearing loss severity was not a decisive factor in narrative text quality. The intervention which the students took part in is potentially effective, with some adaptation to the special needs of students with HL. The strong gender effects are discussed.ARTICLE HISTORY Received 27 January 2020 Revised 18 January 2021Accepted 20 January 2021 KEYWORDS Secondary school; narrativewriting; observationallearning; peer observation Introduction In spite of substantial pedagogical, technical and medical advances in the field, many students with hearing loss (HL)lag behind peers with normal hearing (NH) in complex lan-guage skills, notably reading and writing [ 1-3]. This may be due to slow development of language skills such as spokenlanguage comprehension, reading comprehension and spo-ken narration, all essential for the development of writing skills. It is not surprising then that students with HL do not reach the goals stated in school curriculum to the sameextent as students with NH [ 4]. Only 10 -15% of Swedish high school graduates with HL proceed to higher education,compared to around 60% of graduates with NH [ 5,6]. The present study focuses on writing skills in students with HL in Sweden. References to grades and learning goalsapply to the Swedish school system and curriculum. Onewriting skill that is part of the school curriculum is the pro-duction of narrative texts. Early establishment of a narrativestructure is essential for academic success [ 7-10]. Moreover, being able to produce a written narrative is a prerequisitefor the development of other genres, such as expository or argumentative texts [ 8]. In spoken language, the narrative structure is well-established in six-year-olds with typical lan-guage development [ 11]. At the age of nine, childrengenerally have access to the schema of a well-formed per- sonal narrative [ 12-14]. They know that it consists of an introduction, a sequence of events and an ending, and a description of the characters. The curriculum states thatknowledge of the narrative structure should be established by the end of Grade 3, when children are nine to ten years of age [ 15]. It is however not specified to what extent stu- dents should be able to demonstrate this knowledge in writ- ten narratives [ 15]. The curriculum furthermore states that students from Grades 4 -9 (age 10 -16), should expand their writing skills to other genres, process and revise their text, learn to give and receive feedback, write by hand and on the computer, and learn to organize and edit a text [ 15]. In addition, they should learn to correctly use subordinate clauses, parts-of-speech, morphology, spelling rules, punctu- ation, and text cohesion [ 15]. Further, they should learn which features, such as content and lexicon, are typical for different genres [ 15]. In other words, the processes involved in writing are demanding, even for writers with fundamen-tal transcription skills [ 16]. Swedish female students reach the curriculum goals to a greater extent than male students do [17]. This is corroborated by for instance Kanaris [ 18] who noticed that girls often are good writers and boys areunder-achievers. Similarly, Myhill [ 19] reported that 8- to 10-year-old girls 'texts were comparatively longer and more CONTACT Emily Grenner emily.grenner@med.lu.se Department of Clinical Sciences/Logopedics, Phoniatrics and Audiology, Lund University hospital, Lund, S-221 85, Sweden /C2232021 The Author(s).

At present, it is unclear how the curricular goals in writ- ing may be obtained, despite recent meta-analyses of writing intervention [ 20]. Neither the curriculum nor the teacher training specifies what type of writing instruction should be used, whether for students with NH or HL. Teachers and schools are free to choose their own methods of instruction.The effects of HL on narrative writing are not clearly identi- fied. One reason for this is the heterogeneity in audiological, cognitive and linguistic predispositions in students with HL,and the complex relationships between these variables. Approximately 20 -30% of all school children with HL have language learning problems comparable to those of childrenwith NH diagnosed with a developmental language disorder [21,22]. The degree of HL is one relevant factor in this, but, at the same time, it is seldomly proportional to the severityof language learning difficulties. This suggests that cognitive and linguistic factors need to be taken into consideration to explain why certain students with HL perform better thanothers. For instance, cognitive resources are particularly taxed by a degraded speech signal due to noise, speaker 's voice or poor amplification. Thus, students with HL haveless resources left for a school task [ 23]. There is ample evi- dence that working memory plays a crucial role in writing [24,25]. The writer of a narrative text must recall what hap- pened, plan and organize the events, make lexical choices, formulate sentences correctly and at the same time think about a range of formal aspects like spelling and punctu-ation. The comprehension of spoken language has been associated with spoken narrative skills as well as with read- ing comprehension and school performance [ 7,26] in stu- dents with NH. Reading comprehension and working memory capacity have been shown to be associated with each other in students with HL [ 27,28]. Research on writing in students with HL is scarce. Some aspects of written narratives were studied in 11- to 19-year- old students with HL and controls with NH [ 29]. The stu- dents with HL wrote fewer complex sentences and used fewer function words, but they were not significantly differ- ent from a control group in spelling accuracy. Students withHL had to allocate most of their cognitive resources to lan- guage processing and did not have sufficient resources avail- able for the organisational and formal aspects of a text, theauthors concluded [ 29]. Only a few documented and evi- dence-based writing intervention models are available for this target group. Strassman and Schirmer [ 30] reviewed teaching practices for students with HL and found that methods for teaching writing fell into four categories: teach- ing the writing process itself, looking at properties of fin-ished texts, writing to facilitate content learning, andfeedback on writing. There was, however, no clear evidence of effects [ 30]. More recently, it has been suggested that a combination of three elements (i.e. strategy instruction,teacher -student dialogue, and teaching language skills and metalinguistic awareness) improves writing in students with HL [ 31,32]. One intervention method which includes some of these elements and that others found effective forimproving writing [ 20] is observational learning, which has been found to boost writing in students with NH [ 33-37]. To summarize, the ability to produce a written narrative is a prerequisite for the production of other text genres and for academic achievement. The results from previous studies of texts written by students with NH suggest that girls are better writers than boys. There is a lack of research on asso-ciations between HL and narrative writing. One reason is the large heterogeneity among students with HL. Another is the complicated interaction of HL with other linguistic and cognitive predispositions which may also influence text writ-ing. Finally, neither writing skills in students with HL normethods for teaching writing for these students have been studied extensively. With this in mind, the current study was carried out. The present study The aim of the present study is to identify possible predic- tors of narrative text writing in students with HL. Eleven students from two school classes, Grades 5 -6 and 7 -8, with varying HL severity wrote four texts which were graded by a rater panel. The students 'cognitive and linguistic predis- positions (i.e. working memory capacity, language compre-hension, and reading comprehension) were assessed, and data on audiological factors were collected. The present study is part of a comprehensive study in which students with NH and students with HL followed the same writing intervention [ 36]. The analysis is guided by the following questions: /C15What are the effects of working memory capacity, lan- guage comprehension, reading comprehension, school grade and gender on narrative text quality in students with HL? /C15What associations are there between degree of HL and age at amplification and text quality? /C15Is observational learning suitable for the training of nar- rative text writing in students with HL? Method Students Head teachers and teachers of classes exclusively for stu- dents with HL were contacted. In two classes, one a com- bined Grades 5 -6 and the other a combined 7 -8, the teachers accepted to participate. The students and teachers in the classes communicated with spoken language some- times supported with sign language. The classrooms were equipped with hearing loops (FM system) with microphones for students and teachers. The students followed the samecurriculum as NH students. The total number of students in the two classes was 19. No student was a priori excluded. Six students chose not to participate in the study, but were nevertheless present during the data collection, as recom- mended by the Regional Ethical Review Board. Data fromthese students were discarded. In addition, two students2 E. GRENNER ET AL.missed two or more intervention lessons and their data were also excluded from analysis. Thus, the results of 11 students (5 girls and 6 boys) were used for this study. Table 1provides an overview of the group. The students in Grade 5 -6 were between 12;5 and 13;8 years old, and those in Grade 7 -8 between 13;4 and 15;3 years old. The parents of ten students provided infor-mation about what (spoken or signed) languages were usedat home, and some audiological data of their children.Additionally, audiological records of nine students were consulted, with the consent of the parents. There was thus considerable variation in the detail of available audiologicaldata. For most students, data on better ear hearing level(BEHL) and type of amplification was obtained. The stu-dents 'degree of HL had been categorized according to the classification by [ 38]. This means that a mild HL constitutes a BEHL of 20 -40 dB, moderate, 40 -70 dB, severe, 71 -90, and a profound HL constitutes a BEHL over 90 dB. Twostudents had unilateral HL with severe HL on the afflictedear, while the remaining nine had bilateral HL varying frommild to profound. The age at diagnosis varied from three months to ten years. One student had no amplification. The other students had one or two hearing aids (HA) orbimodal amplification, i.e. one HA and one cochlearimplant (CI). Ten students spoke Swedish as their first lan-guage and one had another European spoken first language. Some students were exposed to one or more additional spo- ken languages or sign language, as well as signing as a formof alternative and augmentative communication. This study was carried out in accordance with the recom- mendations of The Swedish Ethical Review Authority andthe protocol was approved by the Regional Ethical ReviewBoard in Lund (Dnr. 2013/270). The parents and studentsgave written informed consent in accordance with theDeclaration of Helsinki. Narrative texts and text quality ratings The students 'writing performance was assessed four times: one week before and one week after the writing intervention(see below), after another six weeks, and once more afterthe summer vacation five months later. The same time intervals between the first three texts were also used by Grenner et al. [ 36]. The topics of the four texts were, respectively: 1) Write about a time when you were savedfrom a jam, or when you saved someone else from a jam; 2)Write about a time when you were hurt; 3) Write about atime when you were afraid; 4) Write about a time when you made somebody happy. These topics have also been used in previous studies and found suitable for the age group[14,36,39]. The students wrote the texts on a laptop using ScriptLog [ 40], a keystroke logging program with a basic word processing interface. The topic for the narratives waswritten on a slide in the classroom and were also read aloud to the students. At each time, the students had 30 min for writing. The quality of the texts was subsequently rated by a panel of six raters with a method validated by [ 41] and usedin comparable studies of writing [ 36,42]. Before the start of the rating procedure, the raters were shown several bench- mark texts on the same topics with quality ratings marked on a 100-mm visual analogue scale, together with a motiv-ation why each text received a specific rating. The ratingwas holistic, but based on structure and organization, con-tent, grammar and spelling. In the rating procedure, eachtext was rated in the same way by three of the six raters,yielding three scores for each text that could range from 0to 100. The raters were unaware of the order in which thetexts had been written and they were not informed that thetexts had been written by students with HL or that each stu-dent had written several texts. Interrater reliability was cal-culated on a larger dataset including the texts in the presentstudy and other texts on the same topics and was found high (Cronbach 's alpha .90). More details on the rating pro- cedure are provided in [ 36]. Cognitive and linguistic tasks The students were given norm-referenced or standardized tests of verbal working memory capacity [ 43], language comprehension [ 44] and reading comprehension [ 45]. For practical reasons, the tests of working memory capacity andlanguage comprehension were administered after the firsttext was written, while reading comprehension was testedafter the second text was written. All tests were adminis- tered by the researchers in the classroom in the absence of the teachers. Working memory capacity was assessed with a 36-items subset from a classroom screening test [ 43]. The items were pre-recorded and were presented to the students viathe hearing loop. The working memory test has a process com- ponent (general knowledge yes/no-questions), and a recallcomponent (remembering letters). As an example, the stu-dents heard the letter \"B\" and were asked \"Is France larger than Denmark? \". They responded by holding up a YES or a NO sign. Then they would hear the letter \"J\"and were asked \"Is a bird a mammal? \". Again they held up a YES or NO sign, and wrote down the two letters, in the right order.The average for students with NH in Grade 5 is 31.7 (SD5.9) and 32.9 (SD 4.9) for students in Grade 7. Language(listening) comprehension was measured with the Test forReception of Grammar -2, adapted for Swedish [ 44]. This test consists of 80 spoken sentences that each needs to be matched with one of four pictures. The sentences are div- ided into 20 blocks of four sentences which are scored ascorrect if all responses within a block are correct. This yieldsa possible maximum score of 20, and the expected score fornormal-hearing students is approximately 17 for grade 5and 18 for grade 7. In the present study, a research assistantread each sentence aloud, using a microphone connected tothe hearing loop. The pictures were projected on a screen,and the students marked the matching picture in a booklet.Reading comprehension, finally, was assessed using the SL40[45]. In this test, the student reads one sentence at a time and chooses a corresponding picture. The maximum score is 40 points, and normal-hearing students in grade 5LOGOPEDICS PHONIATRICS VOCOLOGY 3normally have a score of at least 38 items correct. Older stu- dents are expected to score all items correct. An overview of the scores on the three tests is displayed inTable 1 . Seven students had scores on the working mem- ory test which were higher than or equal to the referencevalue [ 43]. The scores of the remaining four, though, were well below this value. The average score from the Grade 7 -8 students was not higher than that from the Grade 5 -6 stu- dents. There was a slight tendency that the boys had higherscores than the girls. All scores from the students in Grade5-6 were below the age norms for students with NH on the language comprehension test, while three out of the six stu-dents in Grade 7 -8 had scores which were below the age norms [ 44]. This suggests that the level of language compre- hension was, relatively speaking, somewhat less behind inthe higher grade than in the lower grade. Five students hadscores below the 10th percentile which is a common cut-offfor language disorder. The average score of the Grade 5 -6 students was slightly below that of the Grade 7 -8 students. Only four students had a score on the reading comprehen-sion test of 38 or more, i.e. the norms of fifth-grade stu-dents with NH [ 45]. Writing intervention The students took part in a writing intervention based on observational learning [ 36]. In observational learning, learn- ers watch films of models (usually peers) who perform andcomment upon a writing task [ 35]. In this way, observation and reflection are separated from writing and practice [ 35]. As a consequence, learners do not have to draw on cogni-tive resources while simultaneously performing the targetskill. The paradigm has been found to have a positive effecton writing skills [ 33-37]. In a recent study, 55 students with NH from Grade 5 took part in the lessons. A modest butsignificant increase in text quality was found after the inter-vention, and this effect was somewhat more pronounced instudents with relatively low language comprehension scores[36]. In the present study, five 40 min lessons were given during three consecutive weeks. Each lesson focused mainlyon one aspect of narrative writing, targeted in the curricu-lum [ 15]. See [ 36] for a description of the content and the execution of the lessons.Analyses Various mixed effects models were used to estimate the effects of six predictors: time of measurement (four texts), Grade (5 -6o r7 -8), gender, working memory, language comprehension and reading comprehension. Interactioneffects between time of measurement and the remainingmeasures were also considered. Models were compared on the basis of AIC values. The computations were done in R version 3.5.3 [ 46], using the package lme4 [ 47]. The degree of HL was not used as a predictor in the statistical analysisas the information was missing for some students. The effects of HL will be presented and discussed separately. Results One student only wrote three texts and one other text was not rated. Consequently, 126 quality ratings of 42 texts werecollected and used for data analysis. The individual quality ratings for each text are shown in Table 2 . The average rat- ings for each text varied from 13 to 77 suggesting large dif-ferences in writing skills among the students. Across thefour texts, the ratings within each student were relativelyconsistent, which suggest a constant performance not affected by the writing intervention or general development to the follow-up the next semester. The texts written by theGrade 7 -8 students received on average considerably higher ratings (10 -16 points) than those written by the Grade 5 -6 students. The values in Table 2 show that most students were given a lower score on Text 2 than on Text 1.Table 1. Student overview.

GRENNER ET AL.Several regression models with different groupings of the six predictors (text, grade, gender, working memory, lan- guage comprehension and reading comprehension) were evaluated. The predictor Text was never excluded from these models, but any of the other five predictors could be used to see if the exclusion of this predictor made the model fit significantly worse or not. The list included models with only main effects as well as models with two-way interac- tions between the predictors. An overview of the modelsthat were compared is given in Appendix , with the chosen model indicated in boldface. The random effects in all mod- els were random intercepts for students and for raters. Repeated contrasts were applied to the Text predictor, so that the coefficients represented the successive differences over time, between texts 1 and 2, 2 and 3, 3 and 4. The con- tinuous predictors (i.e. working memory, language compre- hension and reading comprehension) were centered at these variables 'median values in order to enhance the interpret- ability of the regression outcome. The effects of these three variables, however, were not significant in any of the models that were tested. The model that was chosen among those that were evaluated contained the predictors Text, gender,and grade, including interactions of Text and gender and ofgrade and gender. These two-way interactions were both statistically significant, and this model had a lower AIC value than any of the other considered models had. Theoutput of this model is shown in Table 3 . The estimate, labeled \"Intercept, \"is the overall estimated text quality of Text 1 for a female student in Grade 5 -6. The value is just above 33 points. The next three lines indi- cate how text quality changes for Grade 5 -6 female students with slight but non-significant increases across the fourtexts. The following two rows describe the effect of gender and grade on text quality. Boys from Grade 5 -6 wrote texts that were rated 12 points lower than girls 'texts from the same grade. The girls in Grade 7 -8 had an estimated 36 points higher text quality rating than the girls from Grade 5-6. The next three lines indicate how the differences between the four texts written by the boys differ from those written by the girls. The boys differ significantly from the girls on the rating of text four, which received low ratings.The last row in the table shows the interaction between gen-der and school grade. The boys from Grade 7 -8 wrote texts that were actually rated lower than the texts written by the boys from Grade 5 -6.Figure 1 shows the predicted text quality of girls and boys in Grades 5 -6 and 7 -8 for each text. It shows that group differences were larger than any effects over time. Both lines representing girls increase overtime, whereas the lines representing boys decrease, most notably to Text 4, which was written after the sum- mer vacation. In sum, the quality of the texts written by girls increased slightly but non-significantly across the four texts, and was significantly better than the quality of texts written by boys(approximately 12 points for the students in Grade 5 -6, and 40 points for the students in Grade 7 -8). The quality of boys 'texts did not increase over time. On the contrary their text quality decreased (approximately 5 points). In addition, there was a grade effect, but this effect was only significantTable 3. Regression output.

Audiological factors The considerable heterogeneity of the audiological factors motivated the following inspection of individual results for students with the highest and the lowest text quality.

The first of these three (case 6) was a student who was diagnosed with profound HL when she was a few months old and did not receive HA until 17 months later. At the time of the study, she was bimodally aided with a CI and a HA. In spite of the profound HL, lan- guage comprehension was comparable to norms for students with NH, but working memory and reading comprehension were not. The second student (case 7) had a bilateral severe HL for which she was bimodally aided and she was diag- nosed at age three. Her reading comprehension, language comprehension and working memory results were limited compared to norms. The third student (case 8) had a mod-erate HL and was diagnosed at four years old after which she immediately received bilateral HA. She had adequate results on working memory and language comprehension, but low reading comprehension results. In sum, none of the three students with the best text quality was diagnosed early or received amplification early -the earliest at age one and the latest at age four. All three were girls in Grade 7 -8, and their results on the working memory test and language and reading comprehension tests varied. The three students who received the lowest average text quality ratings were a boy in Grade 5 -6 (case 4) and two boys in Grade 7 -8 (cases 9 and 11). The boy in Grade 5 -6 was diagnosed with a HL (of unknown degree to the authors) at six years of age. He received bilateral HA dir- ectly after diagnosis. One boy in Grade 7 -8 (case 9) had a moderate HL. He was diagnosed at age five and amplified bilaterally with HA at age six. The other boy in Grade 7 -8 (case 11) had a moderate HL and was diagnosed at age 10. In sum, the three students with the lowest text quality rat- ings were amplified very late. Two of these students had limited language comprehension (below the 10th percentile) and limited reading comprehension, and one of them had low scores on the working memory capacity test. From this, no clear relation between degree of HL and narrative writ- ing skills is apparent. In fact, the three students with the highest ratings had more severe HL than at least two of thestudents with the lowest ratings. The students who had the lowest text quality ratings were, however, amplified consid- erably later than the students with the highest text qual- ity ratings. Discussion In the present study, possible predictors of narrative textquality in students with HL were investigated over the course of four written narratives and a writing intervention. The results showed effects of gender and grade but not ofworking memory, reading comprehension, or spoken lan- guage comprehension. Nor did text quality ratings changeafter the intervention. Studies on students with HL allemphasize the great heterogeneity of the population [1,48,49]. The present study is no exception. The individual variability between students in the sample of 11 studentswas considerable. Results on the formally assessed linguistic and cognitive tests differed considerably. The students had exposure to one or more spoken languages or to spokenand signed language. Hearing sensitivity and time factors(degree of HL, age at diagnosis and age at amplification) also varied greatly. The students were born before neonatal hearing screening had been implemented in Sweden. Age atdiagnosis and amplification was thus late for a majority of them. Consequently, listening abilities had been challenged for these students for a long time, by degraded speech sig-nals and limited language skills, which may have affectedlanguage comprehension and learning adversely [ 23]. The regression model did not indicate changes in text quality ratings over time, but there were interaction effectsshowing that the text quality was significantly lower in theboys 'texts than the girls ', and that the text quality of the boys 'texts was significantly lower at the fourth text. The fourth text was written a month into the semester after thesummer vacation. One possible explanation is the \"summer loss \"in academic results. In a review by Cooper et al. [ 50], the authors found evidence of setbacks of up to one monthafter the summer vacation in some studies, and gender dif-ferences were found inconclusive between studies. A recent study [ 51] showed that 6- to 9-year-old students with NH may be set back in semantic verbal vocabulary fluency afterthe nine-week long summer vacation, but had regained that loss by the end of the fall semester. The decrease in text quality ratings for boys 'texts at the follow-up text after summer vacation in the present study suggests that boysmay be more affected by a summer loss than girls. The three students who had the highest text quality rat- ings were all girls in Grade 7 -8. While the effect of working memory was not significant in the statistical analysis, it isstriking that among the three students with high text quality ratings were two students with low results on the working memory test. Two of the three students received the highestresults of the eleven students on the reading comprehension test. Reading comprehension and narrative skills are associ- ated [ 52], and these results also suggest that reading com- prehension is an important factor to take into considerationin studies of narrative writing. Further, good reading com- prehension during writing requires automatized reading processes, leaving more capacity for higher level processesof writing. The observed gender differences are consistent with pre- vious findings that girls outperform boys in narrative textwriting [ 18,19,36]. The three students with the lowest aver- age text quality ratings were three boys, one in Grade 5 -6 and two in Grade 7 -8. Two had language comprehension below the 10th percentile compared to reference values onthe test, a common cut-off for language disorder. One also had low results on the working memory test, and all three6 E. GRENNER ET AL.had low results on the reading comprehension test. Poor spoken language comprehension has been indicated as an early predictor of developmental language disorders in chil- dren with NH [ 53,54]. In addition, the students in the pre- sent study may not have received optimal audiologicalintervention, with a late diagnosis of HL and lack of properamplification. Although the three students with the highesttext quality were not amplified early, at 1, 3, and 4 yearsold, they were all amplified considerably earlier than the students with the lowest text quality, who received their HA at 6, 6, and 10 years old. This may have played a role forthe development of language skills of the students. Earlyidentification and intervention are crucial for languagedevelopment [ 1,23,55]. An unexpected finding was that the boys 'texts from the higher grade did not receive higher quality ratings (in fact,even somewhat lower) than the boys from the lower grade.A possible interpretation is that students with HL who per-form well in classes for students with HL may move tomainstream schools between grades 6 and 7, when manystudents change schools, or that students struggling in mainstream schools move to classes for students with HL [56]. Another possible interpretation is that the writing teaching strategies in the higher grade were geared moretowards girls than towards boys. However, in the absence ofmore precise information on what these strategies were, thisconclusion is very tentative and may be addressed infuture studies. The students in the present study responded well to the writing intervention, even though this did not result innoticeable improvements in text quality ratings. Someaspects of the writing intervention may be suitable for stu- dents with HL. When listening is challenged, as it is in stu- dents with HL, a clear and recurrent structure (observation,reflection and learning) could support listening and thus thecomprehension of instructions. Further, the \"film peers \" could be simultaneously seen, heard and read (by subtitles),and even reiterated, which may relieve the students 'listen- ing effort. On the other hand, the relatively implicit natureof observational learning may prove to be too abstract for students with HL, as their linguistic and cognitive skills are often not on par with those of age peers with NH. It maybe supplemented with, for instance, individual feedback onstudents 'written texts with reference to the themes addressed during the lessons or other explicit writinginstruction. It may pose a challenge to design an interven-tion long enough to be effective, but short enough to fit into one semester and to spare time for other curricu- lar goals. Conclusions In the present study, possible predictors of narrative writingskills in students with HL were explored. Girls wrote bettertexts than boys, and school grade had a positive effect ontexts written by girls but not on texts written by boys. Instead, a \"summer loss \"was observed in texts written by boys but not by girls. Age at amplification seemed moreimportant for text quality than severity of HL. There were no statistically significant effects of the students 'working memory, language comprehension, or reading comprehen- sion on text quality. The absence of effects of these predic- tors may have been due to limitations in sample size which inevitably reduced statistical power in the study. For that reason, these conclusions are tentative at present. Finally,the writing intervention in the context of which the data were collected is a promising paradigm but should be fur- ther adapted to the special needs of students with HL.

Predictors AIC Text 1024.3459 of intervention on self-efficacy and text quality in elementary school students 'narrative writing Emily Grennera, Audiology, Lund University, Lund, Sweden;bCentre for Languages and Literature, Lund University, Lund, Sweden ABSTRACT Aim: Self-efficacy for writing is an important motivational factor and considered to predict writing per- formance. Self-efficacy for narrative writing has been sparsely studied, and few studies focus on theeffects of writing intervention on self-efficacy. Additionally, there is a lack of validated measures of self-efficacy for elementary school students. In a previous study, we found that a trained panel rated personal narrative text quality higher for girls than for boys, which led to our aim: to investigate boys ' and girls 'self-efficacy for narrative writing before and after an intervention, and to explore associations between self-efficacy and text quality.Methods: An 18-item self-efficacy scale was developed. Fifty-five fifth-grade students ( M11:2 years, SD 3.7 months) filled out the scale before and after a five-lesson observational learning intervention. Self- efficacy was then related to writing performance as measured by holistic text quality ratings.Results: The students demonstrated strong self-efficacy, which increased significantly post-interven- tion. Girls and boys demonstrated similar self-efficacy, despite girls 'higher text quality. There were moderate correlations between self-efficacy and writing performance pre- and post-intervention. Conclusions: The results support previous findings of strong self-efficacy at this age. The interaction between writing self-efficacy and performance is complex. Young students may not be able to differ-entiate between self-efficacy, general writing skills, task performance, and self-regulation. Self-efficacy scales should thus be carefully constructed with respect to age, genre, instruction, and to students ' general educational context.ARTICLE HISTORY Received 20 February 2019 Revised 11 December 2019 Accepted 17 December 2019 KEYWORDS Self-efficacy; observationallearning; writingimprovement; intervention;elementary education Introduction Self-efficacy is the belief in one 's own capability to perform successfully within a field. According to social cognitive the-ory [ 1], self-efficacy varies widely between domains, in dif- ferent activities within a domain, and under different task demands. Bandura states that stronger self-efficacy leads to a better performance regardless of skill: a person with stron-ger beliefs in her or his capabilities, i.e. self-efficacy, willapproach a difficult task as an achievable challenge, while aperson with weaker self-efficacy will view it as a threat [ 2,3]. To see an achievable challenge will in turn motivate moreeffort, while a threatening task leads to less effort and ahigher risk of giving up [ 3]. Self-efficacy has been shown to predict outcome in diverse domains, including sales per- formance, health, and academic performance [ 4]. For instance, students with strong self-efficacy participating inmath groups of different levels had better performance thangroup-members with weak self-efficacy [ 5]. Bandura further states four sources of self-efficacy: (1) enactive experience,i.e. an earlier successful performance within the field or asimilar field; (2) vicarious experience, i.e. watching \"similarothers \"perform a comparable task; (3) social persuasion, i.e. others expressing beliefs in or providing adequate feedbackon one 's performance; (4) the emotional and physiological state of the person performing the task [ 3,6]. Research on self-efficacy for writing has mainly followed one of two paths [ 7]. One path is represented by correl- ational studies, in which factors that potentially influenceself-efficacy have been explored. The other path, which istaken here, includes experimental studies in which theeffects of writing intervention on self-efficacy are tested. These studies have explored the influence of various instruc- tional approaches on self-efficacy outcomes. One suchapproach is the observational learning paradigm [ 8,9]. The writing instruction in the present study is based on thisparadigm, with a design in which students observed peermodels working with texts, and thereafter discussed themodels 'behavior with their classmates. This method is con- sidered to increase student motivation [ 10], since it offers students structured opportunities to discuss the observationsin groups which induces a comparison of their own writingperformance to that of the peer models (i.e. the above-men-tioned \"vicarious experience \").

For instance, in one study on academic writing, an observational learning intervention increased task knowledge in university students who observed films of dyads of peers writing a literature review. Controls, who did the same exercise with traditional writinginstruction did not show a similar positive effect. In parallel, the increased task knowledge led to an increase in self- efficacy in the experimental group, but not in the control group [ 11]. Self-efficacy development Young children 's self-efficacy is often strong, in that they rate their capability as high in relation to their performance, and holistic, meaning that they do not analyze what they think they can do in different aspects or components [ 12]. From the age of 13 or even earlier, students 'beliefs about their performance weaken [ 12,13], and simultaneously become more diverse across domains. The earlier, more hol- istic self-efficacy may include a combination of appraisal oftheir general skills, their performance at a specific task and their perceived effort, but the links between these factors may not be clear to them [ 14]. Self-efficacy, from the social cognitive point of view, depends on an interaction of cogni- tive, physical, and social development [ 2-4,15]. During ado- lescence, students will begin to experience others ' evaluations of their ability through different forms of feed-back, to a greater extent than in younger ages. They will therefore become more analytic and begin to differentiate between different aspects of a certain skill and result in a better correspondence between self-efficacy and actual per- formance [ 14]. These associations, sometimes referred to as calibration of self-efficacy or self-efficacy accuracy, are com- plex. When self-efficacy is much too strong or if it is too weak, learning is impeded. In the first case, it may lead to the student believing she or he masters the task and thereby does not fully engage in it, and in the second case, that she or he focuses too much on basic concepts to be able to move on to complex matters [ 12,16,17]. For example in writing, a student may focus too much on the spelling of single words, instead of engaging in writing a text with cohesion. In addition, a perfect correspondence between self-efficacy and performance may also be detrimental to development. Judging one 's capability too accurately may block creativity and, as a consequence, limit learning by \"trial and error \". When self-efficacy is slightly lower than performance, the performance can still be adequate. However, it may lead to an anxious and perfection-seeking student, worrying that she or he is not sufficiently capable [3,12,18]. The most productive self-efficacy is found in indi- viduals with a slightly stronger belief in their capabilitiesthan their actual performance [ 3,6]. Measuring self-efficacy Self-efficacy varies between domains, and must thus be measured in a task-specific way. In his recommendations for construction of self-efficacy scales, Bandura [ 18]describes how the statements in a self-efficacy scale should tap into the many different skills which are important for the domain of functioning, but not into other skills or gen- eral abilities. They should concern self-perceived beliefs inone' s own capability to perform a task, as opposed to con- structions targeting intent or comparison to others 'per- formance. Further, the scale should reflect the genre, butnot a specific topic or subgenre, and performance assess-ment (e.g. text quality) should correspond to the content ofthe scale. It should not have too few intermediate steps [ 18]. When the present study was initiated in 2013, validated self-efficacy measures were lacking for the chosen age group, forthe narrative genre, and for students in a Swedish schoolcontext (for more recent scales measuring self-efficacy inyounger students, see Bruning et al. [ 19,20]). A scale for stu- dents in a Dutch context developed by Braaksma et al. [ 9] was used as a point of departure, since the writing interven-tion in Braaksma 's study was based on an observational learning paradigm as was the present study. The scale wasdesigned for teenagers writing argumentative texts and weadapted it to fit 10 -12-year-olds writing narrative texts within the Swedish curriculum. Gender differences in writing performance are often reported, e.g. in the OECD assessment PISA (The Programfor International Student Assessment) which shows higherperformance in girls [ 21]. Research on gender differences in self-efficacy for writing has shown contradictory results. Intwo studies by Pajares et al., similar self-efficacy for writingwas found between girls and boys, while girls 'performance was assessed as better [ 22,23]. The students were also asked to compare their own writing ability to the writing ability ofother girls and boys. In the first study, on 8 -11-year-old students (grades 3 -5), both girls and boys on average con- sidered themselves as better writers than classmates of the other gender, but girls did so to a higher degree [ 22]. In the second study on students aged 11 -14 (grades 6 -8), girls again considered themselves better writers than boys, whilethe boys considered themselves poorer writers than girls[23]. Pajares and Valiante concluded that even if self-effi- cacy is similar for girls and boys, statements in a scale maybe judged differently between genders, girls answering morecautiously [ 23]. Pajares and Valiante further found that gen- der differences were non-significant when controlling forwhat they called \"gender-stereotypic beliefs \"[24]. In a review however, Pajares found that several studies show that girls report stronger self-efficacy than boys during earlier school years, but that the differences even out or reverselater on [ 25]. Text quality The Swedish curriculum does not provide set criteria for assessment for the age group 10 -12 years old. Instead, a method of holistic text quality ratings based on benchmarktexts was chosen for the present study. This method hasbeen used in previous observational learning studies [ 11]a s well as other writing intervention studies, and was tested and validated by Tillema et al. [ 26]. A previous study has2 E. GRENNER ET AL.explored writing performance measured by text quality for the same students as in the present study [ 27]. This was done through measuring text quality in personal narrative texts on repeated occasions in a waiting control design, before and after the observational learning intervention. The narrative genre was chosen as it is a prerequisite for devel- oping other genres and predicts results in higher education [28]. The students in the age-group of the present study are thus expected to be aware of the structure of a narrative text but still to be developing their abilities for creating such texts [ 29]. The results showed that the estimated text quality for boys increased from approximately 33 (on a scale from 0 to 100) before the intervention to approximately 40, as a consequence of intervention. For girls, the estimated text quality increased from 45 to 52. Thus, girls had considerably higher text quality than boys, pre- as well as post-interven- tion, while intervention effects were similar at about seven points on the 0 -100 scale. Cognitive and linguistic abilities are important prerequi- sites for writing performance, at micro- as well as at macro- level [ 30]. Measures of working memory capacity, language comprehension, and reading comprehension were collected for our previous study [ 27], and are presented as demo- graphic data in the present study. Aim In our previous study, the trained raters found that girls ' texts had higher text quality than boys 'texts [ 27]. Considering this difference, the aim of the present study is to explore boys 'and girls 'self-efficacy for narrative writing, before and after intervention. Further, considering that intervention effects on text quality were similar for boys and girls, a secondary aim is to explore associations between self-efficacy and text quality. The study addresses two research questions: 1a. Does self-efficacy for narrative writing change after intervention, and if it does, in what way? 1b. Are there any gender differences? 2. Is self-efficacy related to text quality, and if it is, in what way?Methods Data regarding the participating students, their results on cognitive and linguistic tasks, the texts and text quality, and intervention were also described in our previous study [ 27]. Design and procedure Before and after an observational learning intervention, stu- dents wrote personal narratives and filled out self-efficacy scales. An overview of the design is found in Figure 1 . The students wrote their personal narratives on laptops. A few days or up to a week after the first writing assignment, the students filled out a self-efficacy scale, which is found in Table 1 , and were given a working memory test and a lan- guage comprehension test. The following week, the interven- tion (led by researchers) started for one school, replacing the regular Swedish lessons. The other school had regularSwedish lessons with their teachers during this time. The five intervention lessons were given over three weeks. In the second school, intervention started after nine weeks (week 10 in Figure 1 ). After the intervention period, all students wrote another personal narrative. A few days or up to a week later, they filled out the self-efficacy scale for the Figure 1. Overview of data collection and intervention. Narrative writing assignments pre- and post-intervention (Text), self-efficacy scales pre- and pos t-intervention (Self-efficacy), tests of working memory and language comprehension pre-intervention (tests), intervention, regular lessons, and test of readin g comprehension (test).Table 1.

For practical reasons, working memory and language comprehension tasks were administered pre-intervention, and the reading comprehension task post-intervention. The whole data collection, including intervention, took 13 weeks. Teachers were explicitly asked not to work on written narra- tives with their students during this time. The full data collection and intervention took place in the classroom. All students who typically attended the classes were included, as this study was meant to test the intervention in a natural school environment. All data col- lection and intervention was carried out by the first author and a research assistant. Participants All students came from two schools in areas of similar socio-economic status. With 35 students in fifth grade in one school and 44 in the other, there was a total of 79 stu- dents. Informed consent was collected from 59 students and their parents. Following the advice from the regional ethics board (EPN dnr. 2013/270), no students were a priori excluded from participation in the intervention or data col- lection. The inclusion criteria were, aside from written con- sent: taking part in at least four of the five interventionlessons, adequate Swedish listening comprehension and speech production skills, and being regularly present for whole-class activities. Four students, two from each school, did not meet these criteria and were excluded from the dataset. Thus, 55 students (30 girls and 25 boys) remained, 32 from one school and 23 from the other. Their age was 10:9 to 11:9 years ( M11:2 years, SD3.7 months) and five students had other first languages in addition to Swedish. One student was not present for writing the pre-interven- tion personal narrative, two students 'post-intervention nar- ratives were lost due to software issues, and one student wasnot present for filling out the post-intervention self-efficacy scale. Additionally, two students did not complete the self- efficacy scales. Thus, the total number of students in the analyses varies between 49 and 55. Cognitive and linguistic tasks The students performed according to age norms and results were similar across the two schools and between boys and girls on norm-referenced or standardized tests of working memory [ 31], language comprehension [ 32], and reading comprehension [ 33]. As reported in our previous study [ 27], the students 'mean result was 31.2 ( SD6.5) on the working memory task Lilla Duvan, ranging from 14 to the maximum 36. The norms for the fifth grade are 31.7 ( SD5.8) [ 31]. The mean was 16.5 ( SD2.3) on the language comprehension task TROG-2, ranging from 5 to 19 (maximum score is 20). Scores 15 -19 represent percentiles 23 -73 according to age norms [ 32]. In the reading comprehension task SL40, stu- dents read sentences and chose the corresponding pictures. The mean result was 37.5 ( SD4.1), ranging from 15 to the maximum 40. Scores 37 -39 equal percentiles 25 -75 [33].Self-efficacy scale The self-efficacy scale was adapted from the scale by Braaksma et al. [ 9] to fit the narrative genre as well as the goals for writing stated in the curriculum for the subject of Swedish [ 34] for the age group. There were 18 statements which are listed in Table 1 . Six of them were identical or very similar (statements 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, and 18) to the original scale. The 18 statements reflected aspects of form as well as content, of writing processes as well as the finished text. For example, statement 2, \"I can find all the letters on the key- board \"merely concerned low-level writing processes, while statement 9, \"I can divide my text into beginning, middle, and end \"concerned form (the structure of a narrative) and content (relevant content in the beginning, middle, and end of a story), and to some degree also writing processes (how to go about writing a story with these elements). The stu- dents filled out the self-efficacy scale once before and once after the intervention. The instructions were read aloud to the class and written in the booklet containing the self-effi- cacy scale: Imagine the following scenario: In school, you get a writing assignment where you are to write a narrative story aboutsomething you have experienced. For example, it could bewriting a story about the most exciting time you had during thesummer vacation. It should be written so that somebody in your class could understand it, and the text should be about one page long. You are not going to write this text yourself, butplease answer some questions about what writing such anassignment would be like. Answer each question by marking the horizontal line beneath each question with a vertical line. The further to the right your mark is, the more you agree withthe statement. Beneath each statement was a 100-mm, visual-analogue scale [ 35]. The VAS scale was marked with the phrases \"not at all \"and \"yes, completely \"below the left and right end- points. One of the researchers explained how students should mark the scales according to their beliefs, with illus- trations on the whiteboard. This included demonstrating that the students should put a mark in the middle of the scale if they believed their ability to be average. The markson the scales were measured resulting in possible values ranging from 0 to 100 for each of the 18 statements. Personal narrative texts Personal narratives were written before and after the inter- vention ( Figure 1 ). The students wrote on laptops with a basic word-processing interface, in the classroom. Students were asked to write a personal narrative about \"one time you were saved from a jam you had got into, or when you saved somebody else from a jam \"(the first text) and about \"one time when you were afraid \"(the second text). The topics of the narratives have been used and found suitable for the age group [ 29,36]. Students were not given feedback after the writing tasks.4 E. GRENNER ET AL.Text quality Text quality was assessed by raters who were trained by assessing comparable texts. Four benchmark texts written by age peers were given to the raters, six university students. These texts were given a holistic score, and rated 25, 40, 50, and 95 on a 0 -100 scale. The scores of the benchmark texts were motivated by short, written summaries, describing aspects of content, structure, genre, organization, grammar, spelling, punctuation, and text length. Following this, the raters were practicing in the method of holistic scoring through the rating of another six texts in the same way. In the final data set, each text was rated by three or in some cases two raters.Their inter-rater reliability, calculated on the averages of ratings of the whole rated dataset (including about 150 texts written by students who were not included in the present study) was high (Cronbach 's alpha \u00bc0.90). The raters and texts were distributed at random with the restrictions that each text was rated three times, texts writ- ten by one student would be rated by different raters, and each rater would rate texts from pre- and post-intervention. Raters were not aware of intervention or that one studenthad produced more than one text. Intervention The five-lesson intervention was developed within the obser- vational learning paradigm, a method relying on vicarious experience and structured reflection. The intervention is thoroughly described in Grenner et al. [ 27]. Each lesson had a different theme, which in design and content was based on the Swedish curriculum [ 34] and writing development for the age group: (1) the reader 's perception -what does the reader find important in a story? (2) structure -differ- ent ways to start a story; in what order should the events unfold? (3) conclusion -how to finish a story; (4) editing someone else 's text; (5) editing during writing -what changes do writers make while they write? The lessons were structured around short video clips of 12 different peers. The students were not given any information about the pro- ficiency of the \"film peers \"(low, average, or advanced) they were watching. Thus, instruction was implicit. Analyses Pearson 's bivariate correlations were calculated between each statement and the self-efficacy mean pre- and post- intervention. Means and standard deviations for the self- efficacy statements and the self-efficacy mean pre- and post-intervention were calculated. Repeated measures ANOVA were calculated to test intervention effects of each self-efficacy statement, including interactions with gender. Each self-efficacy statement and self-efficacy mean pre-inter- vention was correlated to text quality pre-intervention by using Pearson 's bivariate correlations. The same was done for these measures post-intervention. The alpha level was set at .05 for all analyses.Results Internal consistency within the self-efficacy scale To explore the internal consistency of the self-efficacy scale, each statement ( Table 1 ) pre-intervention was correlated to the self-efficacy mean pre-intervention. The same procedurewas followed for the statements post-intervention. The results are presented in Table 2 (pre-intervention) and Table 3 (post-intervention). The correlations between the individualstatements and the self-efficacy mean varied between r\u00bc.463 and r\u00bc.858. All correlations were statistically significant indi- cating strong internal consistency, and suggesting that thestudents had consistent beliefs in their ability, across the Table 2.

Self-efficacy increased post-intervention Mean values for the 18 self-efficacy statements varied between 60.8 and 88.0 pre-intervention and between 63.2 and 92.8 post-intervention on the scale with possible values from 0 to 100. All mean values post-intervention were higher than those pre-intervention. Pre-intervention values were M\u00bc76.2, SD\u00bc14.5 for the whole group of students (boys and girls), and post-intervention, the self-efficacy mean had increased to M\u00bc81.7, SD\u00bc13.5 for the whole group of students. Means and standard deviations for each statement and for the self-efficacy mean for boys and girls are found in Table 4 . Some students had considerably lowerself-efficacy mean values than the rest of the group, which is illustrated in Figure 3 . For each self-efficacy statement as well as for self-efficacy mean, a repeated measures ANOVA was run with interven-tion and gender as the independent variables, and change inself-efficacy (from pre- to post-intervention) as the depend-ent variable. The results are presented in Table 4 . The self- efficacy mean increased significantly from pre- to post-inter-vention, F(1, 51) \u00bc22.423, p<.000, g p2\u00bc.305. There was no significant effect of gender and no significant interactionbetween gender and intervention. The increase in self-effi-cacy was significant in 13 of the 18 statements (numbers 1,2, 6, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19) but not in the remaining five statements. For the individual statements, there were no main effects of gender, nor interactions withgender. This means that boys 'and girls 'self-efficacy increased similarly. Figure 2.

GRENNER ET AL.Self-efficacy and text quality Correlations were calculated between the self-efficacy mean pre- and post-intervention and the text quality pre- and post-intervention. Results are found in Table 2 (pre-inter- vention) and Table 3 (post-intervention). Self-efficacy mean pre-intervention had a strong, significant correlation ( r\u00bc.394, p\u00bc.003), and the same was found for self-efficacy text quality post- intervention ( r\u00bc.322, p\u00bc.021). Thus, self-efficacy and text quality had an association, but not as pronounced as the association of self-efficacy pre- and post-intervention. Text quality as measured by trained raters was considerably lowerthan students 'perception of their skills as shown by their self-efficacy [ 2]. This means that the students showed a gen- eral \"overestimation \"of their capability compared to their actual performance as measured by text quality. Correlations between self-efficacy statements ( Table 1 ) and text quality were calculated. Pre-intervention, nine ofthe 18 self-efficacy statements were moderately, statistically significantly correlated with text quality ( Table 2 ). These nine statements were all included in the 13 statements inwhich self-efficacy increased significantly ( Table 4 ). Post- intervention, statements 4 (I can use periods, question marks and exclamation marks in the right places), 6 (I canpartition my text into paragraphs), and 7 (I can write a heading that fits with the content) had a statistically signifi- cant correlation with text quality ( Table 4 ). None of the three was significantly correlated with text quality pre-inter- vention. When there is little variation in the values, correla- tions will not be significant. Summary of results The students demonstrated strong self-efficacy pre- as well as post-intervention, however with considerable individualvariability. The self-efficacy mean increased significantlyafter intervention, even though the effects of the interven- tion on performance, i.e. the increased text quality, were mild, as our previous study showed [ 27]. Scores on 13 out of the 18 self-efficacy statements increased significantly.There were no interactions between gender and intervention effects for individual statements or for the self-efficacymean. Although girls 'texts were assessed as having higher text quality [ 27], boys and girls demonstrated similar self- efficacy. At group level, there were moderate, statistically significant correlations between the self-efficacy mean and text quality, pre- as well as post-intervention. There werestatistically significant correlations between half of the self-efficacy statements and text quality pre-intervention, butonly three statistically significant correlations post- intervention. Discussion In the present study, our aim was to explore self-efficacy for narrative writing in girls and boys, before and after an observational learning intervention. We also aimed to explore associations between self-efficacy and text quality inboys and girls, as our previous study on the same studentsshowed higher text quality in girls 'texts than boys 'texts [27]. The students wrote personal narratives and filled out a self-efficacy scale before and after a short observational learning intervention. Our first research question was whether and in what way self-efficacy for narrative writingchanges after intervention. Most students displayed strongself-efficacy already before intervention, and the self-efficacyratings increased after intervention. There were, however, large individual variations. To sum up, at group level self- efficacy was strong, especially in relation to the text qualityratings made by trained raters. Strong self-efficacy in thisage group is consistent with earlier research [ 19,25]. Social cognitive theory postulates several sources of self-efficacy [1,2,18]. Our intervention design embraces several of these sources. Observing video clips of 12 different peers offeredthe students many examples of how peers work with narra-tive writing ( \"vicarious experience \"). Thus, the students had access to a richer and wider range of skills than using film clips of only an expert writer, which has been tried in e.g. a study by van de Weijer et al. [ 37] or showing only two con- trasting film peers, e.g. as in the study by Braaksma et al.[9], in which the video clips showed only two students at a time working with texts. During the intervention in the pre-sent study, one important component consisted of time for Figure 3. Histograms of self-efficacy mean values of the 55 students pre- and post-intervention.LOGOPEDICS PHONIATRICS VOCOLOGY 7structured reflection, where the participating students were encouraged to talk about the filmed peer models 'oral or written contributions. This was done in small groups and shared with the whole class and can be considered as a form of \"social persuasion \". Although students were not receiving direct feedback on their written texts, they were given \"enactive experience \"when they wrote them. The second part of the first research question was whether there were gender differences in self-efficacy ratings. No such dif- ferences were found. Our second research question was whether, and in what way, self-efficacy was associated with text quality. The self- efficacy results were compared to intervention effects on text quality from our previous study [ 27] on the same stu- dents. There was a statistically significant, moderate correl-ation between self-efficacy mean and text quality before intervention. Post-intervention, the correlation was less pro- nounced, but still moderate. The importance of self-efficacy for writing performance has been discussed by several researchers, and evidence remains inconclusive. Forexample, in a recent study by Graham et al. [ 38] of older secondary school students, it was shown that writing atti- tudes and self-efficacy accounted for statistically significantand unique variance in essay-writing after a range of other variables were controlled for, i.e. gender, eligibility for free lunches, reading self-efficacy, and first language. These find- ings indicate that motivational factors such as self-efficacy and attitudes towards writing must be taken into account inresearch on students 'writing and writing development. Nine self-efficacy statements had statistically significant cor- relations with text quality pre-intervention. Post-interven- tion, three statements had statistically significant correlations with text quality. These concerned punctuation(4), partitioning one 's text into paragraphs (6), and writing headings (7). The three statements did not have statistically significant correlations with text quality pre-intervention.Interestingly, few students actually wrote headings for their narrative texts and very few divided their texts into para- graphs. If there is a lack of distribution along a scale, corre- lations will not be significant, which may explain that there are only three statistically significant correlations post-inter-vention, as at least statements 4 and 7 had very high values. Another possible explanation may be that the students got insights into their own (and peers ') competence in these aspects of writing from the intervention, and were able to rate their self-efficacy more accurately post-intervention,though they did not, for some reason, demonstrate these particular aspects of writing in their texts. Our results show that students had strong beliefs about their writing capabil-ities which is in accordance with previous studies [ 9,11,19]. Previous research also indicates that an \"overestimation \"of skills, i.e. stronger self-efficacy than (raters 'assessment of) writing performance, can be expected in this age group [7,14]. In the present study, no students 'self-efficacy mean decreased after intervention. Instead, the self-efficacy mean and the score on most self-efficacy statements increased sig- nificantly. We found no significant differences in self-effi- cacy between girls and boys, neither before nor afterintervention. However, as our earlier study showed that girls 'text quality was higher [ 27], the girls did not overesti- mate their capability in relation to performance (text qual-ity) to the same degree that the boys did. The argument that girls may be more cautious when reporting self-efficacy [23] may thus apply to the results in this study. There are some drawbacks in the design that may explain why no student had decreased their self-efficacy score. For logistic and practical reasons, the same two researchers dis- tributed self-efficacy scales, administered the narrative writ-ing tasks and performed the intervention lessons. This may have influenced students trying to be compliant towards the researchers by stating increased self-efficacy. The increase inself-efficacy due to study participation per se, i.e. so-called Hawthorne effects [ 39], could also explain the increase. Just performing the intervention could make students feel moreconfident in their abilities. However, the text quality asmeasured by trained raters not aware of intervention or that each student wrote more than one text, also increased sig- nificantly (around seven points on the 0 -100 scale) [ 27]. The validity of the scale merits some further considera- tions. One issue is internal consistency between statements in the self-efficacy scale. In our study, the correlationsbetween statements in the self-efficacy scale and the self-effi-cacy mean were strong pre- as well as post-intervention, indicating that the students 'self-efficacy for narrative writ- ing was quite holistic. The mean values of the 18 self-effi-cacy statements were higher at post-intervention than pre-intervention (with similar standard deviations). Some of the self-efficacy statements were related to specific aspects of narrative writing (e.g. statement 2, \"I can find all the letters on the keyboard \"). In other statements, there was an overlap between form, content, and organization or between process and product aspects of narrative writing. As an example,statement 9, \"I can divide my story into beginning, middle, and end \", may concern writing processes more in this age group than in older adolescents, as they still have not mas- tered lower-level writing processes fully [ 40,41]. Thus, we cannot conclude with certainty that self-efficacy for specificaspects of writing increased as an effect of the intervention. This may, however, be further explored by relating each self-efficacy statement to the other statements. The difficulty in deciding the level of task-specificity has been addressed repeatedly [ 9,11,18]. The level of specificity which was chosen for the scale in this study aligned withBandura 's recommendations [ 18]. Further, the scale should concern belief in one 's capability ( \"I can ...\"), rather than e.g. one 's intent or judgment of performance [ 18]. Our measure of self-efficacy for narrative writing for 10 -12-year- olds was adapted from Braaksma et al. [ 9]. Their scale was targeting self-efficacy for argumentative writing in teenagers, but had the same number of statements, which were similarin their specificity for the genre. Five statements which wereindependent of genre were similar or identical, e.g. \"I can write a text which is one page long \"(statement 18) and \"I can partition my text into paragraphs \"(statement 6). The genre- and age-specific statements were adapted to suit the narrative genre and the age group of the present study,8 E. GRENNER ET AL.basing the content on the Swedish curriculum. For example, the statement \"I can present the arguments and subordinate arguments in a structured way in my text \"from the original scale was adapted to \"I can divide my text into beginning, middle and end \"(statement 9). Thus, it was not our inten- tion to make the statements more specific for the task at hand, as such scales may end up in a pure self-assessment scale. The students in the present study had not been madeexplicitly aware of all the skills mentioned in the statements during intervention, and they were not told which peers showed stronger or poorer writing abilities. Despite using a different scale than previous researchers, our results corroborate earlier findings reporting a some- what poor calibration, i.e. accuracy of self-efficacy, in rela-tion to writing performance [ 9,11,19]. A self-efficacy for writing scale ( \"SEWS \") for middle and high school students by Bruning et al. comprises statements representing threelevels of self-efficacy: ideation (capability to generate ideas), convention (capability to express ideas with language-related tools), and self-regulation (capability to manage one 's behav- ior and writing decisions during writing) [ 19,20]. This scale was also used by De Smedt et al. [ 16]. SEWS was not avail- able when the present study was planned and piloted in2013, but still, it might not have been a better choice of scale for the current study. A third of the statements in SEWS regard self-regulation, which may require metacogni-tive skills not yet developed in students of our age group. In our scale, we wanted to avoid tapping meta-cognitive skills such as self-assessment or self-regulation. However, thequestion remains whether we succeeded. It is a challenging task to construct valid and reliable self-efficacy scales in younger students. This can offer an explanation to why chil-dren in this age span perhaps have difficulties in differenti- ating their skills [ 12,19]. If they consider their abilities in a holistic way, this may be a reason why it is difficult to iso-late clear findings in this study. It is not straightforward to disentangle whether students report on their general cap- ability to write good narratives (i.e. self-efficacy) or if theyreport their self-regulation capacity or their recent perform- ance on a particular narrative, when they are responding to statements in self-efficacy scales. In conclusion, the students in the present study had strong self-efficacy for narrative writing, which increased after intervention. This supports previous findings. The stu-dents may still have a holistic view of their capabilities, not separating their self-efficacy from related factors such as assessment of performance, self-regulation, or general writ-ing skills. Self-efficacy had significant, moderate correlations to performance as measured by text quality, pre- as well as post-intervention. No interaction with gender was found.Constructing self-efficacy scales demands careful consider-ation. Different age groups, educational systems, and genres demand different scales, which have to be properly adapted to the specific educational context. Several research topicsshould be addressed in future studies including self-efficacy scales for writing pre- and post-intervention; the level of task specificity, the age-group, cognitive and linguistic pre-requisites and explicit or implicit instruction. Exploring therelationship between different self-efficacy statements, and between specific aspects of writing and self-efficacy for thoseaspects may add to our understanding of young students ' change from holistic to differentiated self-efficacy.
