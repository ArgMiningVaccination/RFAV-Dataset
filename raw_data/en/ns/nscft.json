They are not orthodox medical doctors (M.D.s). Naturopathic doctors (N.D.s) are conventionally trained in subjects such as anatomy, physiology, counseling, dietary evaluations, nutrition, herbology, acupressure, muscle relaxation and structural normalization, homeopathy, iridology, exercise therapy. Some practitioners are also trained in additional specialties such as acupuncture or natural childbirth. Naturopathic doctors tailor the healing modality to the needs of the individual with methods which are effective for both chronic and acute problems. Naturopathic doctors cooperate with all branches of medical science, referring individuals to other practitioners for diagnosis or treatment when appropriate. In practice, naturopathic doctors perform lifestyle analysis, laboratory testing, nutritional and dietary assessments, metabolic analysis and other evaluative procedures. They are trained to use a wide variety of natural methods which involve the individual in the healing process. Naturopathy is based upon a belief in the body's innate God-given natural ability to heal itself when given an appropriate internal and external healing environment. Naturopaths are not involved in the practice of medicine and do not use drugs or pharmaceuticals, nor do they perform abortions or surgery (other than minor first aid). They have traditionally been referred to as \"drugless doctors.\" In reality, naturopathy deals with wellness and relief from conditions which are the result of stress whether from mental, nutritional, environmental or physical factors. Naturopathic doctors (N.D.s) have participated in a specialized course of study and received degrees in naturopathy. Some states license naturopaths and regulate the profession. In those states, the naturopaths must also have passed a national or state board examination and their practice is subject to review by a State Board of Examiners. Several naturopathic, professional organizations also require the candidate to pass a proficiency test in naturopathy in order to join their organization. [Naturopathy: A Brief History ] Dr. Benedict Lust founded the American School of Naturopathy in New York City and graduated its first class in 1902. A number of other schools were organized and by the 1930's there were more than twenty naturopathic colleges and over 10,000 practitioners. The allopathic medical schools which had the backing of the pharmaceutical industry flourished with large endowments and the political clout which comes with wealth. Due to lack of funding, naturopathic education began to decline and only recently had the disenchantment with pharmaceutically trained doctors led people to once again begin exploring and embracing natural, God-given simple, effective remedies found in naturopathy. [The Naturopathic Philosophy] Advocates a Number of Principles: Naturopathy promotes health through education and non-invasive agents. 1. DO NO HARM Primum non nocere is taken from the Hippocratic Oath. Certainly anybody who is sick does not need any therapy or treatment which can harm him/her. Since prescription medication has such a potential to make a well man sick, many wonder how it can be expected to make a sick man well. Traditional naturopathy embraces only therapies or procedures which are designed to enhance healing and produce wellness. 2. RECOGNIZE THE HEALING POWER OF NATURE Vis medicatrix naturae. The human body is created with the capacity to heal itself and to maintain homeostasis. There is a healing power in nature and this principal is the basis for all of naturopathy. Naturopathy is a system designed to work in harmony with nature in the restoration and support for the inherent natural healing systems of the body. 3. IDENTIFY THE CAUSE Tolle causam. In allopathic medicine the name of the disease is actually the name of the symptom in Greek. For example, the term \"arthritis\" is made up of two Greek roots \"arthro\" which means having to do with the joint and \"itis\" meaning pain or inflammation. Allopathic doctors seek to treat the joint pain by reducing the joint pain. This can be done with the use of pain killers, nerve blockers or any number of procedures. Naturopaths are committed to removing the joint pain by finding and removing the cause. Perhaps this may prove to be a calcium and/or mineral deficiency caused by either a primary or secondary nutritional deficiency. Or perhaps the cause could be from an injury or possibly from an over acid condition in the body. For naturopaths, the correction of the cause is the most plausible way of eliminating the symptoms and restoring health to the person. 4. INVOLVE THE TOTAL PERSON Naturopathic doctors are aware that a person can have a physical, spiritual, or emotional illness. The chosen therapy is determined by what kind of problem the person is experiencing. You can not be well or healthy if you have a spiritual or mental problem even if you appear perfectly fit. Naturopaths use various counseling, stress management and bio-feedback techniques for those experiencing emotional or spiritual problems. Most naturopathic practitioners are capable of also using Biblical counseling as restorative therapy. Reading the writings of the fathers of naturopathy, you will find they were Godly people who recognized the Creator and gave Him the honor for all healing. 5. TEACH RATHER THAN TREAT Naturopathic philosophy places the responsibility for wellness with the individual. Man is the steward of his body and the doctor is the teacher or advisor to the individual on how to maintain health. One recognizes that a headache is not an aspirin deficiency but rather the result of some imbalance within the body. Some principle of health has been violated and the body is responding with pain. Naturopaths should evaluate the connotation and advise or teach their clients what lifestyle, nutritional, emotional or dietary changes should be made to alleviate the condition. The condition is alleviated by the clients making those changes and not by some outside agency. 6. PREVENT DISEASE It is admirable that there is an effective system based on natural restorative methods. However, it is preferable for the body not to experience imbalances and their resulting consequences. Naturopaths are prepared to advise clients on simple disease prevention principles which are designed to produce health and avoid the destructive consequences which occur as the result of violating those principles. [What to Expect ] When you consult a naturopathic doctor for counsel, you will find a person committed to the holistic approach to health. The doctor will gather a medical history, inquire about your diet, discuss any stress you are experiencing, give various non-invasive tests designed to evaluate body conditions and advise you concerning your condition. You will experience techniques which are consistent with traditional naturopathy and its philosophy. These will enable your body to correct problems and prevent them from occurring in the future. | ||To be sure of the training of your naturopathic doctor and his/her adherence to natural healing principles, ask your doctor if he/she is a \"Registered Naturopathic Doctor.\" | In a society focused on an allopathic mindset, naturopaths can provide people with more options in the treatment of disease and pain. These options, along with being non-invasive, are all natural and, in actuality, are more historical methods in the pursuit of good health. [Classical Naturopathy ] A classical naturopath specializes in wellness. That is to say teaching clients how applying natural lifestyle approaches can act to facilitate the body's healing and health building potential. The classical naturopath does not undertake to diagnose or treat disease but recognizes that the majority of sub-health conditions are cumulative effects. Also the underlying cause of disease is improper diet, unhealthy habits and environmental factors that cause biological imbalances leading to a weakening of the body's defenses and subsequent breakdown in health. The practice of classical naturopathy is not considered the practice of medicine and is legal in all 50 states, however, some states have made naturopathy illegal unless licensed. This is because legislature is grouping classical naturopaths with naturopathic physicians. Naturopathic physicians have a 4-year degree that includes pharmacology and minor surgery, which should require a license. The practice of classical naturopathy is recognized as a common occupation at the federal level (U.S. Congress 1928, 1929, 1930 and 30 Federal Court rulings between 1958 and 1978) and in such a profession is protected under the 14th and 9th Amendments of the U.S. Constitution. Several states have also made this stipulation either by statute or in the Courts. All disease is one and what medical doctors call diseases are only symptoms of a greater underlying problem. Disease is nothing more than a manifestation of our body trying to correct imbalances. Imbalances due to faulty nutritional patterns, improper rest, stress management and other lifestyle considerations which over time result in a weakening of the body. By the time disease appears on the scene it is very late in the game. Our body tells us early on when there is a problem and we can either respond to this message or try to suppress the symptoms that the body uses to tell us there is a problem. You can take ibuprofen, or other drugs to suppress the symptoms and they will help for a short time. However, unless the underlying problem is corrected, eventually the symptoms will no longer be helped by these drugs and one will need to take stronger and stronger drugs to quiet the body's message. If the underlying problem has not been addressed, the body will begin to break down structurally. At this time modern medicine is finally capable of diagnosing that something is really wrong and offer interventions to fix the structure, but still medical doctors fail to address the underlying problem. Naturopathy concentrates on identifying destructive aspects in lifestyles that lead to imbalances. Before symptoms manifest and long before a diagnosis can be rendered, these destructive aspects of our lifestyle can be identified and corrected. Once corrected, the body automatically corrects itself. Diagnosing disease and illness is totally unnecessary to correcting the underlying problems that result in disease and illness. A true healer does not waste his time concentrating on naming diseases but rather on identifying those underlying factors that if not addressed result in the manifestation of disease and illness. These factors can be identified and corrected long before it is even possible to make any diagnosis. Even after a diagnosis is made the same concepts of healing used by classical naturopaths are equally effective because once balance is restored the body automatically heals itself. "}
