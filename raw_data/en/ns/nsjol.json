China's State Councilor Liu Yandong attended the opening ceremony and made opening remarks, which pointed out that an era of frequent exchange and close cooperation on global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) has come.Liu Yandong said that satellite navigation systems, as important space infrastructure, can provide all-weather and highly accurate location and time information. They have been widely used in transportation, marine fishery, disaster relief and mitigation, social management, national security, etc., which profoundly influences human life and production. The Chinese government has attached great importance to the development of satellite December 25 20121-2MOST will Establish an Innovation System Dominated by Enterprises Minister Wan Gang of Science and Technology said in his keynote speech of Pujiang Innovation Forum 2012 that Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) will deepen the reform of scientific and technological system, and accelerate the establishment of an industrial technology innovation system dominated by enterprises. \"We have recognized that the key to combining scientific and technological development on the one hand, with economic and social development on the other, is enterprises' active participation. We will create innovation environment for fair competition among all types of enterprises, and support innovative activities of small- and medium-sized enterprises and microenterprises. We should formulate policy guidelines to encourage enterprises to establish their own research and development (R&D) institutions, promote the inflow of innovation factors to enterprises, and encourage scientific and technological talents to make innovation in business sector,\" he said. Minister Wan Gang listed 5 points to deepen the reform of scientific and technological system: 1) strengthen collaborative innovation to increase the overall efficiency of the innovation system; 2) reform the science & technology management system to efficiently use scientific and technological resources; 3) improve the talent development system; 4) enhance research integrity and foster innovation culture; 5) open up further, encourage mutually-beneficial and win-win cooperation, improve innovation policies and create favorable environment. Minister Wan Gang added that MOST will as navigation systems, included Beidou Satellite Navigation System into National Science and Technology Key Project, and created a series of satellite navigation products with proprietary intellectual property rights, which promotes the development of emerging industrial clusters and brings about considerable economic and social benefits. \"In the field of satellite navigation system, an era of frequent exchange and close cooperation has come,\" Councilor Liu said, adding that it is shared understanding and responsibility of the GNSS family to intensify coordination and cooperation, and raise service level of navigation systems. She advocated all-round, multi-tiered and high level exchange and cooperation under the principles of equality, mutual benefit and win-win cooperation so that we can share resources, draw upon each other's strength and seek common development, thus helping satellite navigation systems better serve the whole world and benefit the mankind. China is willing to work with other countries to uphold opening up and cooperation, share achievements of satellite navigation development, jointly formulate standards, strengthen compatibility among different systems, spread good practices, explore new areas of service, and promote the extensive application of satellite navigation systems worldwide in order to provide strong support for global economic development and improvement of people's life. The International Committee on GNSS (ICG) is an intergovernmental informal body established with the advocate of the United Nations, for the purpose of enhancing cooperation on satellite navigation while promoting global application of satellite navigation.

The initial proof-of-principle certified that its performance is ten times higher than that of the original HPC. The research team of new concept HPC architectures and system implementation project, which belongs to 863 Program approved in 2009, came up with Proactive Reconfigurable Computing Achitecture (PRCA) after five years' dedicated effort. PRCA has 3 highlights. 1.The amazing physical realization structure. Due to allotropic structure and the remodeling material based on the various structural arrangements, PRCA can balance function, performance, efficacy and flexibility. 2. The structure-reengineering ability resulting from material cognition. PRCA is able to recognize and sense the temperature, power consumption and then instruct the operation by cognitive decision systems. 3. The high performance. The physical realization structure of PRCA leads to structure-reengineering, which realize the possibility of high application performance through the adaptation of hardware or software processing structures. As certified by the initial proof-of-principle, the performance of new concept HPCis ten times higher than that of the original HPC and therefore considerable electric bills will be cut after its application. The hardware of the proof-of-principle sample machine has been manufactured and is under vital technology test and application test.The whole project is expected to be completed at the end of this year.

The cooperation team makes public the most complete integrated linkage map of human genome sequence variation , which will lay a solid foundation for the application of genomics in human disease and health and personalized health care. The cooperation team conducted detailed DNA analysis on genetic variation of 1,092 people drawn from 14 populations around the world, including Africa, Asia, Europe and America. By using the whole genome sequencing, exon target sequence capture and SNP typing and other technologies, a variation map based on the analysis results took shape. It will help human beings find genetic reason for both rare and common diseases.
