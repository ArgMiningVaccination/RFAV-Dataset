Athena Chiropractic in Wilmington, DE, can help you learn how to improve your health and experience the best benefits of supplements! If you have questions about how we can help, read below! What Are Nutritional Supplements? Nutritional supplements are substances taken orally to supplement the diet. They provide vitamins, minerals, and other essential nutrients in desired amounts, either naturally or in lab-created forms. We use supplements for various reasons, such as providing extra energy, boosting the immune system, regulating hormones, and improving overall health. What Benefits Do Nutritional Supplements Have? Nutritional supplements provide the body with essential nutrients that may be lacking in the diet. These can include vitamins, minerals, amino acids, fiber, and other substances necessary for the proper functioning of different systems in the body. Nutritional supplements also have several other benefits, such as promoting weight loss, improving energy levels, reducing inflammation, and maintaining healthy bones and teeth. How Can Nutritional Supplements Help? At Athena Chiropractic, we tailor nutritional supplement plans for each patient, depending on their unique needs. We consider current health concerns and any medications or supplements the patient may already be taking to formulate a safe and effective plan. We also provide education on the best sources of nutrition, so patients can make informed decisions regarding their health. When taken correctly, nutritional supplements can help improve overall health and well-being by providing essential nutrients to the body in a safe, natural form. They can also address specific health concerns, such as fatigue, stress, and low immunity. Which Supplements Are Right for Me? It's always better to work with a health specialist like our chiropractor when taking nutritional supplements. Athena Chiropractic can provide personalized recommendations on which accessories are right for you and the proper dosage of each supplement. To determine which supplements are best for your needs, we may order lab tests to evaluate your body's current levels of essential vitamins and minerals. These tests can help us identify deficiencies that need to be addressed with nutritional supplements.
