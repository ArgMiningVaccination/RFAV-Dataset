The earliest records of meditation ( [dhyana](/wiki/Dhyana_in_Hinduism)) are found in the [Upanishads](/wiki/Upanishads), and meditation plays a salient role in the contemplative repertoire of [Hinduism](/wiki/Hinduism), [Jainism](/wiki/Jainism) and [Buddhism](/wiki/Buddhism). [[5]](#cite_note-:5-7) Since the 19th century, Asian meditative techniques have spread to other cultures where they have also found application in non-spiritual contexts, such as business and health. [[6]](#cite_note-Sun_2019_pp._45-55-8) Meditation may significantly reduce [stress](/wiki/Stress_(biology)), [anxiety](/wiki/Anxiety), [[11]](#cite_note-auto-13) of meditation](/wiki/Effects_of_meditation) on health ( [psychological](/wiki/Psychology), [neurological](/wiki/Neurology), and [cardiovascular](/wiki/Cardiovascular)) and other areas. Etymology[ English meditation is derived from [Old French](/wiki/Old_French) in turn from [Latin](/wiki/Latin) [meditatio](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/meditatio) ponder\". [[12]](#cite_note-14) [[13]](#cite_note-oel-15) In the [Catholic](/wiki/Catholic) tradition, the use of the term meditatio as part of a formal, stepwise process of meditation goes back to at least the 12th century monk [Guigo II](/wiki/Guigo_II), [[13]](#cite_note-oel-15) [[14]](#cite_note-16) before which the Greek word [Theoria](/wiki/Theoria) was used for the same purpose. Apart from its historical usage, the term meditation was introduced as a translation for Eastern [spiritual practices](/wiki/Spiritual_practice), referred to as dhyna in [Hinduism](/wiki/Hinduism) and [Buddhism](/wiki/Buddhism) and which comes from the meaning contemplate or meditate. [[15]](#cite_note-17) [[16]](#cite_note-feurstein06-18) [[17]](#cite_note-19) The term \"meditation\" in English may also refer to practices from Islamic [Sufism](/wiki/Sufism), [[18]](#cite_note-20) or other traditions such as Jewish [Kabbalah](/wiki/Kabbalah) and [Hesychasm](/wiki/Hesychasm). [[19]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGoleman1988-21) Definitions[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Meditation&action=edit\u00a7ion=2)] [edit](/w/index.php?title=Meditation&action=edit\u00a7ion=3)] No universally accepted definition[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Meditation&action=edit\u00a7ion=4)] Meditation has proven difficult to define as it covers a wide range of dissimilar practices in different traditions. In popular usage, the word \"meditation\" and the phrase \"meditative practice\" are often used imprecisely to designate practices found across many [cultures](/wiki/Culture). [[19]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGoleman1988-21) [[20]](#cite_note-carroll05-22) These can include almost anything that is claimed to train the attention of mind or to teach calm or compassion. [[21]](#cite_note-:2-23) There remains no definition of necessary and sufficient criteria for meditation that has achieved universal or widespread acceptance within the modern scientific [community](/wiki/Community). In 1971, [Claudio Naranjo](/wiki/Claudio_Naranjo) noted that \"The word 'meditation' has been used to designate a variety of practices that differ enough from one another so that we may find trouble defining what meditation is.\" [[22]](#cite_note-naranjo72-24): 6 A 2009 study noted a \"persistent lack of consensus in the [literature](/wiki/Literature)\" and a \"seeming intractability of defining meditation\". [[23]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBondOspinaHootonBialy2009135-25) Separation of technique from tradition[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Meditation&action=edit\u00a7ion=5)] Some of the difficulty in precisely defining meditation has been in recognizing the particularities of the many various [traditions](/wiki/Tradition); [[24]](#cite_note-intro_to_consciousness-26) and theories and practice can differ within a [tradition](/wiki/Tradition). [[25]](#cite_note-Dunne_@_Stanford-27) Taylor noted that even within a [faith](/wiki/Faith) such as \"Hindu\" or \"Buddhist\", schools and individual teachers may teach distinct types of meditation. [[26]](#cite_note-taylor99-28): 2 Ornstein noted that \"Most techniques of meditation do not exist as solitary practices but are only artificially separable from an entire system of practice and belief.\" [[27]](#cite_note-ornstein72-29): 143 For instance, while monks meditate as part of their everyday lives, they also engage in the codified rules and live together in monasteries in specific cultural settings that go along with their meditative practices. Dictionary definitions[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Meditation&action=edit\u00a7ion=6)] Dictionaries give both the meaning of \"think[ing] deeply about (something)\"; [[web 2]](#cite_note-Oxford-6) as well as the popular usage of \"focusing one's mind for a period of time\", [[web 2]](#cite_note-Oxford-6) \"the act of giving your attention to only one thing, either as a religious activity or as a way of becoming calm and relaxed\", [[web 3]](#cite_note-30) and \"to engage in mental exercise (such as concentrating on one's breathing or repetition of a [mantra](/wiki/Mantra)) for the purpose of reaching a heightened level of spiritual awareness.\" [[web 1]](#cite_note-MW-5) Scholarly definitions[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Meditation&action=edit\u00a7ion=7)] In modern [psychological](/wiki/Psychology) research, meditation has been defined and characterized in various ways. Many of these emphasize the role of [attention](/wiki/Attention) [[19]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGoleman1988-21) [[28]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEWalshShapiro2006-31) [[29]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTECahnPolich2006-32) [[30]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEJevningWallaceBeidebach1992-33) and characterize the practice of meditation as attempts to get beyond the reflexive, \"discursive to achieve a deeper, more devout, or more relaxed state. Bond et al. (2009) identified criteria for defining a practice as meditation \"for use in a comprehensive systematic review of the therapeutic use of meditation\", using \"a 5-round [Delphi study](/wiki/Delphi_method) with a panel of 7 experts in meditation research\" who were also trained in diverse but empirically highly studied (Eastern-derived or clinical) forms of meditation [[note 4]](#cite_note-38): three main criteria ... as essential to any meditation practice: the use of a defined technique, logic relaxation, [[note 5]]and a self-induced state/mode. Other criteria deemed important [but not essential] involve a state of psychophysical relaxation, the use of a self-focus skill or anchor, the presence of a state of suspension of logical thought processes, a religious/spiritual/philosophical context, or a state of mental silence. [[23]] ... It is plausible that meditation is best thought of as a natural category of techniques best captured by ' [family resemblances]' ... or by the related ['prototype' model of concepts].\" [[32]] Several other definitions of meditation have been used by influential modern reviews of research on meditation across multiple [traditions](/wiki/Tradition): [[note 6]](#cite_note-43) - Walsh & Shapiro (2006): \"Meditation refers to a family of self-regulation practices that focus on training attention and awareness in order to bring mental processes under greater voluntary control and thereby foster general mental well-being and development and/or specific capacities such as calm, clarity, and concentration\" [[1]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEWalshShapiro2006228-229-1) - Cahn & Polich (2006): \"Meditation is used to describe practices that self-regulate the body and mind, thereby affecting mental events by engaging a specific attentional set.... regulation of attention is the central commonality across the many divergent methods\" [[2]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTECahnPolich2006180-2) - Jevning et al. (1992): \"We define meditation... as a stylized mental technique... repetitively practiced for the purpose of attaining a subjective experience that is frequently described as very restful, silent, and of heightened alertness, often characterized as blissful\" [[3]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEJevningWallaceBeidebach1992415-3) - Goleman (1988): \"the need for the meditator to retrain his attention, whether through concentration or mindfulness, is the single invariant ingredient in... every meditation system\" [[4]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGoleman1988107-4) Classifications[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Meditation&action=edit\u00a7ion=8)] Focused and open methods[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Meditation&action=edit\u00a7ion=9)] In the West, meditation techniques have often been classified in two broad categories, which in actual practice are often combined: focused (or concentrative) meditation and open monitoring (or [mindfulness](/wiki/Mindfulness)) meditation: [[35]](#cite_note-lutz08-44) Direction of mental attention... A practitioner can focus intensively on one particular object (so-called concentrative meditation), on all mental events that enter the field of awareness (so-called mindfulness meditation), or both specific focal points and the field of awareness. [[36]] Focused methods include [paying attention to the breath](/wiki/Anapanasati), to an idea or feeling (such as [mett](/wiki/Mett%C4%81) - loving-kindness), to a [kan](/wiki/K%C5%8Dan), or to a [mantra](/wiki/Mantra) (such as in [transcendental meditation](/wiki/Transcendental_Meditation)), and single point meditation. [[37]](#cite_note-46) [[38]](#cite_note-47) Open monitoring methods include [mindfulness](/wiki/Mindfulness), [shikantaza](/wiki/Shikantaza) and states. [[39]](#cite_note-48) Other possible Another [typology](/wiki/Typology_(disambiguation)) divides and reflective practices: [[40]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGangadharanHemamalini202170-49) [[41]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEAguirre201818-20-50) - concentrative: focused attention, including breath meditation, TM, and visualizations; - generative: developing qualities like loving kindness and compassion; - receptive: open monitoring; - reflective: systematic investigation, [contemplation](/wiki/Contemplation). The Buddhist tradition often divides meditative practice into [samatha](/wiki/Samatha-vipassana), or calm abiding, [[42]](#cite_note-51) [[43]](#cite_note-52) and [vipassana](/wiki/Vipassana), insight. [Mindfulness of breathing](/wiki/Anapanasati), a form of focused attention, calms down the mind; this calmed mind can then investigate the nature of reality, [[44]](#cite_note-berkeley.edu-53) [[45]](#cite_note-54) [[46]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEPerez-De-AlbenizHolmes2000-55) by monitoring the fleeting and ever-changing constituents of experience, by reflective investigation, or by \"turning back the radiance,\" focusing awareness on awareness itself and discerning the true nature of [mind](/wiki/Mind) as [awareness](/wiki/Awareness) itself. Matko and Sedlmeier (2019) \"call into the common division into \"focused attention\" and \"open-monitoring\" practices.\" They argue for \"two orthogonal dimensions along which meditation techniques could be classified,\" namely \"activation\" and \"amount of body orientation,\" proposing seven clusters of techniques: \"mindful observation, body-centered meditation, visual concentration, contemplation, affect-centered meditation, mantra meditation, and meditation with movement.\" [[47]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMatkoSedlmeier2019-56) Jonathan Shear argues that [transcendental meditation](/wiki/Transcendental_Meditation_technique) is an \"automatic self-transcending\" technique, different from focused attention and open monitoring. [[48]](#cite_note-Travis,_F._2010-57) In this kind of practice, \"there is no attempt to sustain any particular condition at all. Practices of this kind, once started, are reported to automatically \"transcend\" their own activity and disappear, to be started up again later if appropriate.\" [[48]](#cite_note-Travis,_F._2010-57) [[note 7]](#cite_note-58) Yet, Shear also states that \"automatic self-transcending\" also applies to the way other techniques such as from Zen and Qigong are practiced by experienced meditators \"once they had become effortless and automatic [[48]](#cite_note-Travis,_F._2010-57) Technique[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Meditation&action=edit\u00a7ion=11)] Posture[ [half-lotus](/wiki/Ardha_Padmasana)), cross-legged [Buddhism](/wiki/Buddhism) and [Jainism](/wiki/Jainism), [[49]](#cite_note-59) although other postures such as sitting, supine (lying), and standing are also used. Meditation is also sometimes done while walking, known as [kinhin](/wiki/Kinhin), while doing a simple task mindfully, known as [samu](/wiki/Samu_(Zen)), or while lying down, known as [shavasana](/wiki/Shavasana). [[50]](#cite_note-60) [[51]](#cite_note-61) Postures involve focus attention and move body coordinately or hold still with rhythmic inhalation and exhalation. [[52]](#cite_note-62) Frequency[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Meditation&action=edit\u00a7ion=13)] The [Transcendental Meditation](/wiki/Transcendental_Meditation) technique recommends practice of 20 minutes twice per day. [[53]](#cite_note-huffingtonpost.co.uk-63) Some techniques suggest less time, [[44]](#cite_note-berkeley.edu-53) especially when starting meditation, [[54]](#cite_note-64) and [Richard Davidson](/wiki/Richard_Davidson) has quoted research saying benefits can be achieved with a practice of only 8 minutes per day. [[55]](#cite_note-abcnews1-65) Research shows improvement in meditation time with simple oral and video training. [[56]](#cite_note-66) Some meditators practice for much longer, [[57]](#cite_note-67) [[58]](#cite_note-68) particularly when on a course or [retreat](/wiki/Spiritual_retreat). [[59]](#cite_note-69) Some meditators find practice best in [the hours [[60]](#cite_note-70) Supporting aids[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Meditation&action=edit\u00a7ion=14)] Use of prayer beads[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Meditation&action=edit\u00a7ion=15)] Some religions have traditions of using [prayer beads](/wiki/Prayer_beads) as tools in devotional beads and [Christian rosaries](/wiki/Rosary_based_prayers) consist of pearls or beads linked together by a thread. [[61]](#cite_note-Binz3-71) [[62]](#cite_note-Sach-72) The Roman Catholic rosary is a string of beads containing five sets with ten small beads. The Hindu [japa mala](/wiki/Japa_mala) has 108 beads (the figure 108 in itself having spiritual significance), as well as those used in [Gaudiya Vaishnavism](/wiki/Gaudiya_Vaishnavism), the [[64]](#cite_note-74) [[65]](#cite_note-Vishnu-75) Each bead is counted once as a person recites a [mantra](/wiki/Mantra) until the person has gone all the way around the mala. [[65]](#cite_note-Vishnu-75) The Muslim [misbaha](/wiki/Misbaha) has 99 beads. There is also quite a variance when it comes to materials used for beads. Beads made from seeds of [rudraksha](/wiki/Rudraksha) trees are considered sacred by devotees of [Shiva](/wiki/Shiva), while followers of [Vishnu](/wiki/Vishnu) revere the wood that comes from the tulsi plant. [[66]](#cite_note-76) Striking the meditator[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Meditation&action=edit\u00a7ion=16)] The Buddhist literature has many stories of [Enlightenment](/wiki/Enlightenment_in_Buddhism) being attained through disciples being struck by their masters. According to T. Griffith Foulk, the [encouragement stick](/wiki/Keisaku) was an integral part of the [Zen](/wiki/Zen) practice: In the Rinzai monastery where I trained in the mid-1970s, according to an unspoken etiquette, monks who were sitting earnestly and well were shown respect by being hit vigorously and often; those known as laggards were ignored by the hall monitor or given little taps if they requested to be hit. Nobody asked about the 'meaning' of the stick, nobody explained, and nobody ever complained about its use. [[67]] Using a narrative[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Meditation&action=edit\u00a7ion=17)] Neuroscientist and long-time meditator Richard Davidson has expressed the view that having a narrative can help the maintenance of daily practice. [[55]](#cite_note-abcnews1-65) For instance he himself [prostrates](/wiki/Prostration_(Buddhism)) to the teachings, and meditates \"not primarily for my benefit, but for the benefit of others\". [[55]](#cite_note-abcnews1-65) Meditation traditions[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Meditation&action=edit\u00a7ion=18)] Origins[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Meditation&action=edit\u00a7ion=19)] The history of meditation is intimately bound up with the religious context within which it was practiced. [[68]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEEverlyLating2002199-202-78) Rossano has suggested that the emergence of the capacity for focused attention, an element of many methods of meditation, may have contributed to the latest phases of human biological evolution. [[69]](#cite_note-79) Some of the earliest references to meditation, as well as proto- [Samkhya](/wiki/Samkhya), are found in the [Upanishads](/wiki/Upanishads) of India. [[70]](#cite_note-80) [[71]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTELusthaus2018-81) The earliest clear references to meditation are in the middle [Upanishads](/wiki/Upanishads) and the [Mahabharata](/wiki/Mahabharata) (including the [Bhagavad the earlier Upanishad](/wiki/Brihadaranyaka_Upanishad) is describing meditation when it states that \"having become calm and concentrated, one perceives the self (tman) system were referred to as [salvation](/wiki/Salvation)-path. It has three parts called the [Ratnatraya](/wiki/Ratnatraya) \"Three Jewels\": right perception and faith, right knowledge and right conduct. [[75]](#cite_note-Ratna_traya-85) Meditation in [Jainism](/wiki/Jainism) aims at realizing the self, attaining [salvation](/wiki/Salvation), and taking the soul to complete freedom. [[76]](#cite_note-blessings-86) It aims to reach and to remain in the pure state of soul which is believed to be pure consciousness, beyond any attachment or aversion. The practitioner strives to be just a knower-seer (gyata-drashta). Jain meditation can be broadly and Shukla Dhyana.[ [clarification on a [mantra](/wiki/Mantra). [[77]](#cite_note-HN4U-87) A mantra could be either a combination of core letters or words on deity or themes. There is a rich tradition of [mantra](/wiki/Mantra) in [Jainism](/wiki/Jainism). All Jain followers irrespective of their sect, whether [Digambara](/wiki/Digambar) or [vetmbara](/wiki/Svetambara), practice [mantra](/wiki/Mantra). [Mantra](/wiki/Mantra) chanting is an important part of daily lives of Jain monks and followers. [Mantra](/wiki/Mantra) chanting can be done either loudly or silently in mind. [[77]](#cite_note-HN4U-87) [Contemplation](/wiki/Contemplation) is a very old and important meditation technique. The practitioner meditates deeply on subtle facts. In agnya vichya, one contemplates on seven facts - life and non-life, the inflow, bondage, stoppage and removal of [karmas](/wiki/Karma), and the final accomplishment of liberation. In apaya vichya, one contemplates on the incorrect insights one indulges, which eventually develops right insight. In vipaka vichya, one reflects on the eight causes or basic types of [karma](/wiki/Karma). In sansathan vichya, one thinks about the vastness of the universe and the loneliness of the soul. [[77]](#cite_note-HN4U-87) Buddhism[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Meditation&action=edit\u00a7ion=22)] [Buddhists](/wiki/Buddhism) pursue meditation as part of the path toward [awakening](/wiki/Bodhi) and [nirvana](/wiki/Nirvana). [[note 8]](#cite_note-89) The closest words for meditation in the classical languages of [Buddhism](/wiki/Buddhism) are [bhvan](/wiki/Bhavana) (\"development\"), and the core practices [samdhi](/wiki/Sam%C4%81dhi). [[note 10]](#cite_note-91) While most classical and meditation guides are school-specific, [[note 11]](#cite_note-92) the root meditative practices of various body recollections and [breath meditation](/wiki/Anapanasati) have been preserved and transmitted in almost all [Buddhist traditions](/wiki/Schools_of_Buddhism), through [Buddhist texts](/wiki/Buddhist_texts) like the [Dhyana sutras](/wiki/Dhyana_sutras), and through oral teacher-student transmissions. These ancient practices are supplemented with various distinct interpretations of, and developments in, these practices. The [Theravda](/wiki/Therav%C4%81da) tradition stresses the development of [samatha](/wiki/Samatha-vipassana) and vipassana, postulating over fifty methods for developing mindfulness based on the Satipatthana Sutta, [[note 12]](#cite_note-93) and forty for developing concentration based the [Visuddhimagga](/wiki/Visuddhimagga). The [Tibetan tradition](/wiki/Tibetan_Buddhism) incorporated [Sarvastivada](/wiki/Sarvastivada) and Tantric practices, wedded with [Madhyamaka](/wiki/Madhyamaka) philosophy, and developed thousands of visualization meditations. [[note 13]](#cite_note-94) Via the Dhyana sutras, which are based on the Sarvastivada-tradition, the Zen-tradition incorporated mindfulness and breath-meditation. Downplaying of and [[80]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMcRae1986116-96) the [awareness](/wiki/Awareness) of immanent death), the early Chan-tradition developed the notions or practices of wu nian (\"no thought, no \"fixation on thought, such as one's own views, experiences, and the one without wavering,\" [[85]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMcRae1986143-101) turning the attention from the objects of experience, to the [nature of mind](/wiki/Nature_of_mind), the perceiving subject itself, which is equated with [Buddha-nature](/wiki/Buddha-nature). [[86]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTESharf2014939-102) The [Silk Road transmission of Buddhism](/wiki/Silk_Road_transmission_of_Buddhism) introduced meditation to other Asian countries, reaching China in the 2nd century CE, [[87]](#cite_note-103) and Japan in the 6th century CE. [[88]](#cite_note-104) In the modern era, Buddhist meditation techniques have become popular in the wider world, due to the influence of [Buddhist modernism](/wiki/Buddhist_modernism) on Asian [Buddhism](/wiki/Buddhism), and [western lay with many non-Buddhists taking-up meditative practices. The modernized concept of mindfulness (based on the Buddhist term [sati](/wiki/Sati_(Buddhism))) and related meditative practices have in turn led to [mindfulness based therapies](/wiki/Mindfulness#Therapy_programs). [[89]](#cite_note-105) Dhyana[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Meditation&action=edit\u00a7ion=23)] [Dhyana](/wiki/Dhy%C4%81na_in_Buddhism) may have been an original contribution of [Gautama Buddha](/wiki/Gautama_Buddha) (5th cent. BCE), the founder of [Buddhism](/wiki/Buddhism). [[90]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBronkhorst1993-106) While often presented as a form of focused attention or concentration, as in Buddhagosa's Theravada classic the [Visuddhimagga](/wiki/Visuddhimagga) (\"Path of purification, 5th c. CE), according to a number contemporary scholars and scholar-practitioners, it is actually a description of the development of perfected equanimity and mindfulness, apparently induced by satipatthana, an open monitoring of the breath, without trying to regulate it. The same description, in a different formula, can be found in the [bojjhanga](/wiki/Bojjhanga), the \"seven factors of awakening,\" and may therefore refer to the core program of early Buddhist bhavana. [[91]](#cite_note-107) According to Vetter, dhyana seems to be a natural development from the sense-restraint and moral constrictions prescribed by the Buddhist tradition. [[92]](#cite_note-108) [[93]](#cite_note-109) Samatha and vipassana[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Meditation&action=edit\u00a7ion=24)] The Buddha identified two paramount mental qualities that arise from wholesome meditative practice or bhavana, namely [samatha](/wiki/Samatha) (\"calm,\" \"serenity\" \"tranquility\") and [vipassana](/wiki/Vipassana) (insight). As the developing tradition started to emphasize the value of liberating insight, and dhyana came to be understood as concentration, [[94]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBronkhorst1993131-110) [[95]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEVetter1988xxi-xxxvii-111) [samatha](/wiki/Samatha-vipassana) and [vipassana](/wiki/Vipassana) were understood as two distinct meditative techniques. In this understanding, [samatha](/wiki/Samatha-vipassana) steadies, composes, unifies and concentrates the mind, while [vipassana](/wiki/Samatha-vipassana) enables one to see, explore and discern \"formations\" (conditioned phenomena based on the five [aggregates](/wiki/Skandha)). [[note 14]](#cite_note-112) According to this understanding, which is central to Theravada orthodoxy but also plays a role in [Tibetan Buddhism](/wiki/Tibetan_Buddhism), through the meditative development of serenity, one is able to weaken the obscuring [hindrances](/wiki/Five_Hindrances) and bring the mind to a collected, pliant, and still state ( [samadhi](/wiki/Samadhi)). This quality of mind then supports the development of insight and wisdom ( [Praj\u00f1](/wiki/Praj%C3%B1%C4%81_(Buddhism))) which is the quality of mind that can \"clearly see\" (vi-passana) the nature of phenomena. What exactly is to be seen varies within the Buddhist traditions. In Theravada, all phenomena are to be seen as [impermanent](/wiki/Anicca), [suffering](/wiki/Dukkha), [not-self](/wiki/Anatta) and [empty](/wiki/Shunyata). When this happens, one develops [dispassion](/wiki/Nonattachment_(philosophy)) (viraga) for all phenomena, including all negative qualities and hindrances and lets them go. It is through the release of the hindrances and ending of craving through the meditative development of insight that one gains liberation. [[96]](#cite_note-113) Hinduism[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Meditation&action=edit\u00a7ion=25)] There are many schools and styles of meditation within [Hinduism](/wiki/Hinduism). [[74]](#cite_note-Flood-84) In pre-modern and traditional [Hinduism](/wiki/Hinduism), Yoga to recognize 'pure awareness', or 'pure consciousness', undisturbed by the workings of the mind, as one's eternal self. In [Advaita Vedanta](/wiki/Advaita_Vedanta) [jivatman](/wiki/Jivatman), individual self, is recognized as illusory, and in Reality identical with the omnipresent and [non-dual](/wiki/Nonduality_(spirituality)) [tman](/wiki/%C4%80tman_(Hinduism))- [Brahman](/wiki/Brahman). In the [dualistic Yoga school](/wiki/Yoga_(philosophy)) and [Samkhya](/wiki/Samkhya), the Self is called [Purusha](/wiki/Purusha), a pure consciousness undisturbed by [Prakriti](/wiki/Prakriti), 'nature'. Depending on the tradition, the liberative event is named [moksha](/wiki/Moksha), vimukti or [kaivalya](/wiki/Kaivalya). [[97]](#cite_note-114) One of the most influential texts of classical Hindu Yoga is [Pata\u00f1jali](/wiki/Pata%C3%B1jali)'s [Yoga sutras](/wiki/Yoga_Sutras_of_Patanjali) (c. 400 CE), a text associated with Yoga and Samkhya, which outlines [eight limbs](/wiki/Ashtanga_(eight_limbs_of_yoga)) leading to [kaivalya](/wiki/Kaivalya) [samdhi](/wiki/Sam%C4%81dhi).[ [citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)] Later developments in Hindu meditation include the compilation of [Hatha Yoga](/wiki/Hatha_Yoga) (forceful yoga) compendiums like the [Hatha Yoga Pradipika](/wiki/Hatha_Yoga_Pradipika), the development of [Bhakti yoga](/wiki/Bhakti_yoga) as a major form of meditation, and [Tantra](/wiki/Tantra). Another important Hindu yoga text is the [Yoga Yajnavalkya](/wiki/Yoga_Yajnavalkya), which makes (meditation) good deeds are both necessary to achieve the devotee's spiritual goals; [[98]](#cite_note-115) without good deeds meditation is futile. When Sikhs meditate, they aim to feel God's presence and emerge in the divine light.[ [citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)] It is only God's [divine will](/wiki/Hukam) or order that allows a devotee to desire to begin to meditate.

Traditional Daoist meditative practices were influenced by [Chinese Buddhism](/wiki/Chinese_Buddhism) from around the 5th century and influenced [Traditional and the [Chinese martial arts](/wiki/Chinese_martial_arts).[ [citation view\") meditation seeks to merge and attain unity with the Dao. It was developed by [Tang Dynasty](/wiki/Tang_Dynasty) (618-907) Taoist masters based upon the [Tiantai](/wiki/Tiantai) Buddhist practice of [Vipassan](/wiki/Vipassan%C4%81) \"insight\" or \"wisdom\" meditation. Cun [](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E5%AD%98) (lit. \"exist; be survive\") has a sense of \"to cause to exist; to make present\" in the meditation techniques popularized by the Taoist [Shangqing](/wiki/Shangqing_School) and [Lingbao Schools](/wiki/Lingbao_School). A meditator visualizes or actualizes solar and lunar essences, lights, and deities within their body, which supposedly results in health and longevity, even [xian](/wiki/Xian_(Taoism)) //, \"immortality\".[ [citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)] The (late 4th century BCE) [Guanzi](/wiki/Guanzi_(text)) essay [Neiye](/wiki/Neiye) \"Inward training\" is the oldest received writing on the subject of [qi](/wiki/Qi) cultivation and breath-control meditation techniques. [[102]](#cite_note-Cambridge-119) For instance, \"When you enlarge your mind and let go of it, when you relax your vital breath and expand it, when your body is calm and unmoving: And you can maintain the One and discard the myriad disturbances. ... This is called \"revolving the vital breath\": Your thoughts and deeds seem heavenly.\" [[103]](#cite_note-120) The (c. 3rd century BCE) Taoist [Zhuangzi](/wiki/Zhuangzi_(book)) records [zuowang](/wiki/Zuowang) or \"sitting forgetting\" meditation. [Confucius](/wiki/Confucius) asked \"sit and forget\" means: \"I slough off my limbs and trunk, dim my intelligence, depart from my form, leave knowledge behind, and become identical with the Transformational Thoroughfare.\" [[104]](#cite_note-121) Taoist meditation practices are central to [Chinese martial arts](/wiki/Chinese_martial_arts) (and some [Japanese martial which is thought of as moving meditation. One common explanation contrasts \"movement in stillness\" referring to energetic visualization of qi circulation in qigong and [zuochan](/wiki/Zuochan) \"seated meditation\", [[46]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEPerez-De-AlbenizHolmes2000-55) versus \"stillness in movement\" referring to a state of meditative calm in [taijiquan](/wiki/Tai_chi) forms.

Monotheistic religions[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Meditation&action=edit\u00a7ion=28)] Judaism[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Meditation&action=edit\u00a7ion=29)] Judaism has made use of meditative practices for thousands of years. [[105]](#cite_note-Verman1-122) [[106]](#cite_note-123) For instance, in the [Torah](/wiki/Torah), the patriarch [Isaac](/wiki/Isaac) is described as going \"\" (lasuach) in the field - a term understood by all commentators as some type of meditative practice ( [Genesis](/wiki/Book_of_Genesis) 24:63). [[107]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKaplan1978101-124) Similarly, there are indications throughout the [Tanakh](/wiki/Tanakh) (the Hebrew [Bible](/wiki/Bible)) that the [prophets](/wiki/Old_Testament_prophets) meditated. [[108]](#cite_note-Verman45-125) In the [Old ), and s\u00ee\u00e2 ( [Hebrew](/wiki/Hebrew_language): ), to muse, or rehearse in one's mind. [[109]](#cite_note-Kaplan,_A._1985-126) Classical Jewish texts espouse a wide range of meditative practices, often associated with the cultivation of [kavanah](/wiki/Kavanah) or intention. The first layer of [rabbinic law](/wiki/Halakha), the [Mishnah](/wiki/Mishnah), describes ancient sages \"waiting\" for an hour before their prayers, \"in order to direct their hearts to the Omnipresent One ( [Mishnah](/wiki/Mishnah) [Berakhot](/wiki/Berakhot_(tractate)) 5:1). Other early [rabbinic texts](/wiki/Rabbinic_texts) include visualizing the Divine Presence (B. [Talmud](/wiki/Talmud) [Sanhedrin](/wiki/Sanhedrin_(tractate)) 22a) and breathing with conscious gratitude for every ( [Genesis Rabba](/wiki/Genesis_Rabba) 14:9). [[110]](#cite_note-127) One of the best-known types of meditation in early Jewish mysticism was the work of the [Merkabah](/wiki/Merkabah), from the root /R-K-B/ meaning \"chariot\" (of God). [[109]](#cite_note-Kaplan,_A._1985-126) Some meditative traditions have been encouraged in [Kabbalah](/wiki/Kabbalah), and some Jews have described Kabbalah as an inherently meditative field of study. [[111]](#cite_note-128) [[112]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKaplan1982-129) [[113]](#cite_note-130) Kabbalistic meditation often involves the mental visualization of the supernal realms. [Aryeh Kaplan](/wiki/Aryeh_Kaplan) has argued that the ultimate purpose of Kabbalistic meditation is to understand and cleave to the Divine. [[109]](#cite_note-Kaplan,_A._1985-126) Meditation has been of interest to a wide variety of modern Jews. In modern Jewish practice, one of the best known meditative practices is called \" [hitbodedut](/wiki/Hitbodedut)\" (, alternatively transliterated as \"hisbodedus\"), and is explained in [Kabbalistic](/wiki/Kabbalah), [Hasidic](/wiki/Hasidic), and [Mussar](/wiki/Mussar_Movement) writings, especially the Hasidic method of Rabbi [Nachman of Breslav](/wiki/Nachman_of_Breslav). The word derives from the Hebrew word \"boded\" (), meaning the state of being alone. [[114]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKaplan1978op_cit_p._2-131) Another Hasidic system is the [Habad](/wiki/Habad) method of \"hisbonenus\", related to the [Sephirah](/wiki/Sephirah) of \"Binah\", Hebrew for understanding. [[115]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKaplan1982op_cit,_p._13-132) This practice is the analytical reflective process of making oneself understand a mystical concept well, that follows and internalises its study in Hasidic writings. The [Musar Movement](/wiki/Musar_Movement), founded by Rabbi Israel Salanter in the middle of the nineteenth-century, emphasized meditative practices of [introspection](/wiki/Introspection) and [visualization](/wiki/Mental_image) that could help to improve moral character. [[116]](#cite_note-133) Conservative rabbi [Alan Lew](/wiki/Alan_Lew) has emphasized meditation playing an important role in the process of [teshuvah (repentance)](/wiki/Teshuvah). [[117]](#cite_note-134) [[118]](#cite_note-135) [Jewish Christianity[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Meditation&action=edit\u00a7ion=30)] [Christian meditation](/wiki/Christian_meditation) is a term for a form of prayer in which a structured attempt is made to get in touch with and deliberately reflect upon the revelations of [God](/wiki/God). [[121]](#cite_note-138) In the [Roman Empire](/wiki/Roman_Empire), by 20 BCE [Philo of Alexandria](/wiki/Philo_of_Alexandria) had written on some form of \"spiritual exercises\" involving attention (prosoche) and concentration [[122]](#cite_note-139) and by the 3rd century [Plotinus](/wiki/Plotinus) had developed meditative techniques. The word meditation comes from the Latin word meditatum, which means to \"concentrate\" or \"to ponder\". Monk [Guigo II](/wiki/Guigo_II) introduced this terminology for the first time in the 12th century AD. Christian meditation is the process of deliberately focusing on specific thoughts (e.g. a [biblical](/wiki/Biblical) scene involving [Jesus](/wiki/Jesus) and the [Virgin Mary](/wiki/Virgin_Mary)) and reflecting on their meaning in the context of the love of God. [[123]](#cite_note-140) Christian meditation is sometimes taken to mean the middle level in a broad three-stage characterization of prayer: it then involves more reflection than first level vocal [prayer](/wiki/Prayer), but is more structured than the multiple layers of [contemplation](/wiki/Contemplation) in Christianity. [[124]](#cite_note-141) Between the 10th and 14th centuries, [hesychasm](/wiki/Hesychasm) was developed, particularly on [Mount Athos](/wiki/Mount_Athos) in Greece, and involves the repetition of the [Jesus prayer](/wiki/Jesus_prayer). [[125]](#cite_note-142) Interactions with Indians or the [Sufis](/wiki/Sufis) may have influenced the [Eastern Christian](/wiki/Eastern_Christian) meditation approach to hesychasm, but this is unproven. [[126]](#cite_note-143) [Western Christian](/wiki/Western_Christian) meditation contrasts with most other approaches in that it does not involve the repetition of any phrase or action and requires no specific posture. Western Christian meditation progressed from the 6th century practice of Bible reading among [Benedictine](/wiki/Order_of_Saint_Benedict) monks called [Lectio Divina](/wiki/Lectio_Divina), i.e. divine reading. Its four formal steps as a \"ladder\" were defined by the monk [Guigo II](/wiki/Guigo_II) in the 12th century with the Latin terms lectio, meditatio, oratio, and contemplatio (i.e. read, ponder, pray, contemplate). Western Christian meditation was further developed by saints such as [Ignatius of Loyola](/wiki/Ignatius_of_Loyola) and [Teresa of Avila](/wiki/Teresa_of_Avila) in the On April 28, 2021, [Pope Francis](/wiki/Pope_Francis), in an address to the General Audience, said that meditation is a need for everyone. [[131]](#cite_note-:4-148) [[132]](#cite_note-149) He noted that the term \"meditation\" has had many meanings throughout history, and that \"the ancients used to say that the organ of prayer is the heart.\" [[131]](#cite_note-:4-148) In Catholic Christianity, the [Rosary](/wiki/Rosary) is a devotion for the meditation of the mysteries of Jesus and Mary. [[133]](#cite_note-150) [[134]](#cite_note-151) \"The gentle repetition of its prayers makes it an excellent means to moving into deeper meditation. It gives us an opportunity to open ourselves to God's word, to refine our interior gaze by turning our minds to the life of Christ. The first principle is that meditation is learned through practice. Many people who practice rosary meditation begin very simply and gradually develop a more sophisticated meditation. The meditator learns to hear an interior voice, the voice of God. [[135]](#cite_note-152) Similarly, the [chotki](/wiki/Chotki) of the [Eastern Orthodox](/wiki/Eastern_Orthodox) denomination, the [Wreath of Christ](/wiki/Wreath_of_Christ) of the [Lutheran](/wiki/Lutheran) faith, and the [Anglican prayer beads](/wiki/Anglican_prayer_beads) of the [Episcopalian](/wiki/Anglican) tradition are used for Christian prayer and meditation. [[136]](#cite_note-Dhiman2020-153) [[137]](#cite_note-Winston2008-154) According to [Edmund P. Clowney](/wiki/Edmund_P._Clowney), Christian meditation contrasts with Eastern forms of meditation as radically as the portrayal of [God the Father](/wiki/God_the_Father) in the Bible contrasts with depictions of [Krishna](/wiki/Krishna) or [Brahman](/wiki/Brahman) in Indian teachings. [[138]](#cite_note-155) Unlike some Eastern styles, most styles of Christian meditation do not rely on the repeated use of [mantras](/wiki/Mantra), and yet are also intended to stimulate thought and deepen meaning. Christian meditation aims to heighten the personal relationship based on the love of God that marks Christian communion. [[139]](#cite_note-156) [[140]](#cite_note-157) In [Aspects of Christian meditation](/wiki/Aspects_of_Christian_meditation), the [Catholic Church](/wiki/Catholic_Church) warned of potential incompatibilities in mixing Christian and Eastern styles of meditation. [[141]](#cite_note-158) In 2003, in [A Christian reflection on the New Age](/wiki/A_Christian_reflection_on_the_New_Age) the [Vatican](/wiki/Holy_See) announced that the \"Church avoids any concept that is close to those type of meditation within Islam, meaning remembering and mentioning God, which involves the repetition of the 99 Names of God since the 8th or 9th century. [[145]](#cite_note-Prayer_page_147-149-162) [[146]](#cite_note-Education'_page_63-163) It is interpreted in different meditative techniques in Sufism or Islamic mysticism. [[145]](#cite_note-Prayer_page_147-149-162) [[146]](#cite_note-Education'_page_63-163) This became one of the essential elements of Sufism as it was systematized traditionally. It is juxtaposed with fikr (thinking) which leads to knowledge. [[147]](#cite_note-164) By the 12th century, the practice of Sufism included specific meditative techniques, and its followers practiced breathing controls and the repetition of holy words. [[148]](#cite_note-Spiritual_Psychology'_page_109-165) Sufism uses a meditative procedure like Buddhist [concentration](/wiki/Samadhi_(Buddhism)), involving high-intensity and sharply focused introspection. In the Oveyssi-Shahmaghsoudi Sufi order, for example, [muraqabah](/wiki/Muraqabah) takes the form of \"concentration\" in [Persian](/wiki/Persian_language). [[149]](#cite_note-166) Tafakkur or tadabbur in Sufism literally means reflection upon the [universe](/wiki/Universe): this is considered to permit access to a form of [cognitive](/wiki/Cognitive) and [emotional](/wiki/Emotion) development that can emanate only from the higher level, i.e. from God. The sensation of receiving divine inspiration awakens and liberates both heart and intellect, permitting such inner growth that the apparently mundane actually takes on the quality of the [infinite](/wiki/Infinity). Muslim teachings embrace life as a test of one's submission to God. [[150]](#cite_note-167) [Dervishes](/wiki/Dervish) of certain Sufi orders practice [whirling](/wiki/Sufi_whirling), a form of physically active meditation. [[151]](#cite_note-168) Bah\u00e1\u00ed Faith[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Meditation&action=edit\u00a7ion=32)] In the teachings of the [Bah\u00e1\u00ed Faith](/wiki/Bah%C3%A1%CA%BC%C3%AD_Faith), meditation is a primary tool for spiritual development, [[152]](#cite_note-bahai-meditation-169) involving reflection on the words of God. [[153]](#cite_note-Smith-meditation-170) While prayer and meditation are linked, where meditation happens generally in a prayerful attitude, prayer is seen specifically as turning toward God, [[154]](#cite_note-Smith-prayer-171) and meditation is seen as a communion with one's self where one focuses on the divine. [[153]](#cite_note-Smith-meditation-170) In [Bah\u00e1\u00ed teachings](/wiki/Bah%C3%A1%CA%BC%C3%AD_teachings) the purpose of meditation is to strengthen one's understanding of the words of God, and to make one's soul more susceptible to their potentially transformative power, [[153]](#cite_note-Smith-meditation-170) more receptive to the need for both prayer and meditation to bring about and maintain a spiritual communion with God. [[155]](#cite_note-172) [Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h](/wiki/Bah%C3%A1%27u%27ll%C3%A1h), the founder of the religion, never specified any particular form of meditation, and thus each person is free to choose their own form. [[152]](#cite_note-bahai-meditation-169) However, he did state that Bah\u00e1\u00eds should read a passage of the [Bah\u00e1\u00ed writings](/wiki/Bah%C3%A1%CA%BC%C3%AD_literature) twice a day, once in the morning, and once in the evening, and meditate on it. He also encouraged people to reflect on one's actions and worth at the end of each day. [[153]](#cite_note-Smith-meditation-170) During the [Nineteen Day Fast](/wiki/Nineteen_Day_Fast), a period of the year during which Bah\u00e1\u00eds adhere to a sunrise-to-sunset fast, they meditate and pray to reinvigorate their spiritual forces. [[156]](#cite_note-directives-173) Modern spirituality[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Meditation&action=edit\u00a7ion=33)] Modern dissemination in the West[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Meditation&action=edit\u00a7ion=34)] Meditation has spread in the West since the late 19th century, accompanying increased travel and communication among cultures worldwide. Most prominent has been the transmission of Asian-derived practices to the West. In addition, interest in some Western-based meditative practices has been revived, [[157]](#cite_note-reininger98-174) and these have been disseminated to a limited extent to Asian countries. [[158]](#cite_note-contempout-175) Ideas about Eastern meditation had begun \"seeping into American popular culture even before the American Revolution through the various sects of European occult Christianity\", [[26]](#cite_note-taylor99-28): 3 and such ideas \"came pouring in [to America] during the era of the transcendentalists, especially between the 1840s and the 1880s.\" [[26]](#cite_note-taylor99-28): 3 The following decades saw further spread of these ideas to America: The [World Parliament of Religions], held in Chicago in 1893, was the landmark event that increased Western awareness of meditation. This was the first time that Western audiences on American soil received Asian spiritual teachings from Asians themselves. Thereafter, [Swami Vivekananda]... [founded] various [Vedanta]ashrams... [Anagarika in 1904; [Abdul Baha]... [toured] the and [Soyen Shaku]toured in 1907 teaching Zen... [[26]]: 4 More recently, in the 1960s, another surge in Western interest in meditative practices began. The rise of communist political power in Asia led to many Asian spiritual teachers taking refuge in Western countries, oftentimes as refugees. [[26]](#cite_note-taylor99-28): 7 In addition to spiritual forms of meditation, secular forms of meditation have taken root. Rather than focusing on spiritual growth, secular meditation emphasizes stress reduction, relaxation and self-improvement. [[159]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEEverlyLating2002200-176) [[160]](#cite_note-177) The 2012 US National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) (34,525 subjects) found 8% of US adults used meditation, [[161]](#cite_note-178) with lifetime and 12-month prevalence of meditation use of 5.2% and 4.1% respectively. [[162]](#cite_note-179) In the 2017 NHIS survey, meditation use among workers was 10% (up from 8% in 2002). [[163]](#cite_note-180) Mantra meditation, with the use of a japa mala and especially with focus on the [Hare Krishna maha-mantra](/wiki/Hare_Krishna_maha-mantra), is a central practice of the [Gaudiya Vaishnava](/wiki/Gaudiya_Vaishnava) faith tradition and the [International Society for Krishna Consciousness](/wiki/International_Society_for_Krishna_Consciousness) (ISKCON), also known as the Hare Krishna movement. Other popular [New Religious Movements](/wiki/New_Religious_Movements) philosophy, [mysticism](/wiki/Mysticism), [yoga](/wiki/Yoga), [Hinduism](/wiki/Hinduism) and [Buddhism](/wiki/Buddhism), yet may contain some degree of Western influence. In the West, meditation found its mainstream roots through the [social revolution of the 1960s and 1970s](/wiki/Counterculture_of_the_1960s), when many of the [youth of the day](/wiki/Baby_boomers) rebelled against traditional religion as a reaction against what some perceived as the failure of Christianity to provide spiritual and ethical guidance. [[164]](#cite_note-181) New Age meditation as practised by the early hippies is regarded for its techniques of blanking out the mind and releasing oneself from conscious thinking. This is often aided by repetitive chanting of a mantra, or focusing on an object. [[165]](#cite_note-182) New Age meditation evolved into a range of purposes and practices, from serenity and balance to access to other realms of consciousness to the concentration of energy in group meditation to the supreme goal of samadhi, as in the ancient yogic practice of meditation. [[166]](#cite_note-183) Guided meditation[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Meditation&action=edit\u00a7ion=36)] Guided meditation is a form of meditation which uses a number of different techniques to achieve or enhance the meditative state. It may simply be meditation done under the guidance of a trained practitioner or teacher, or it may be through the use of imagery, music, and other techniques. [[167]](#cite_note-184) The session can be either in person, via media [[168]](#cite_note-185) comprising music or verbal instruction, or a combination of both. [[169]](#cite_note-186) [[170]](#cite_note-187) The most common form is a combination of [meditation music](/wiki/Meditation_music) and [receptive [[171]](#cite_note-188) [[172]](#cite_note-189) [[173]](#cite_note-190) Because of the different combinations used under the one term, it can be difficult to attribute positive or negative outcomes to any of the various techniques. Furthermore, the term is frequently used interchangeably with \"guided imagery\" and sometimes with \"creative visualization\" in [popular psychology](/wiki/Popular_psychology) and [self-help](/wiki/Self-help) literature. It is less commonly used in [scholarly](/wiki/Scholarly_method) and [scientific](/wiki/Scientific_method) publications. Consequently, guided meditation cannot be understood as a single technique but rather multiple techniques that are integral to its practice. [[174]](#cite_note-191) [[175]](#cite_note-192) [[176]](#cite_note-193) [[177]](#cite_note-194) Guided meditation as an aggregate or of which have been shown to have [therapeutic](/wiki/Therapy) benefits when employed as an adjunct to primary strategies.

[[188]](#cite_note-205) [[189]](#cite_note-206) He clearly advocated ways to increase the conscious [awareness](/wiki/Awareness) of an individual. Yet he expressed some caution concerning a westerner's direct immersion in eastern practices without some prior appreciation of the differing spiritual and cultural contexts.

[[212]](#cite_note-229) [[213]](#cite_note-230) Effects[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Meditation&action=edit\u00a7ion=43)] Research on the processes and meditation](/wiki/Effects_of_meditation) is a subfield of [neurological](/wiki/Neurology) research. [[10]](#cite_note-goyal-12) Modern scientific techniques, such as [fMRI](/wiki/FMRI) and [EEG](/wiki/EEG), were used to observe neurological responses during meditation. [[214]](#cite_note-231) Concerns have been raised on the quality of meditation research, [[10]](#cite_note-goyal-12) [[215]](#cite_note-VanDam-232) [[216]](#cite_note-stetka-233) including the particular characteristics of individuals who tend to participate. [[217]](#cite_note-234) Meditation lowers heart rate, oxygen consumption, breathing frequency, [stress hormones](/wiki/Stress_hormone), [lactate](/wiki/Lactic_acid) levels, and [sympathetic nervous system](/wiki/Sympathetic_nervous_system) activity (associated with the [fight-or-flight response](/wiki/Fight-or-flight_response)), along with a modest decline in blood pressure. [[218]](#cite_note-235) [[219]](#cite_note-236) However, those who have meditated for two or three years were found to already have low blood pressure. During meditation, the oxygen consumption decrease averages 10 to 20 percent over the first three minutes. During sleep for example, oxygen consumption decreases around 8 percent over four or five hours. [[220]](#cite_note-237) For meditators who have practiced for years, breath rate can drop to three or four breaths per minute and brain waves slow from [alpha waves](/wiki/Alpha_wave) seen in normal relaxation to much slower [delta](/wiki/Delta_wave) and [theta waves](/wiki/Theta_wave). [[221]](#cite_note-238) Since the 1970s, [clinical psychology](/wiki/Clinical_psychology) and [psychiatry](/wiki/Psychiatry) have developed meditation techniques for numerous psychological conditions. [[222]](#cite_note-Harrington2015-239) Mindfulness practice is employed in psychology to alleviate mental and physical conditions, such as reducing [depression](/wiki/Depression_(mood)), stress, and [anxiety](/wiki/Anxiety). [[10]](#cite_note-goyal-12) [[223]](#cite_note-Strauss-240) [[224]](#cite_note-Khoury2015-241) Mindfulness is also used in the treatment of [drug addiction](/wiki/Drug_addiction), although the quality of research has been poor. [[216]](#cite_note-stetka-233) [[225]](#cite_note-Chiesa-242) Studies demonstrate that meditation has a moderate effect to reduce pain. [[10]](#cite_note-goyal-12) There is insufficient evidence for any effect of meditation on positive mood, attention, eating habits, sleep, or body weight. [[10]](#cite_note-goyal-12) A 2015 study, including subjective and objective reports and brain scans, has shown that meditation can improve controlling attention, as well as self-awareness. [[226]](#cite_note-243) A 2017 systematic review and meta-analysis of the effects of meditation on [empathy](/wiki/Empathy), [compassion](/wiki/Compassion), and [prosocial](/wiki/Prosocial) behaviors found that meditation practices had small to medium effects on self-reported and observable outcomes, concluding that such practices can \"improve positive prosocial emotions and behaviors\". [[227]](#cite_note-244)[ a meta-review published on [Scientific Reports](/wiki/Scientific_Reports) showed that the evidence is very weak and \"that the effects of meditation on compassion were only significant when compared to passive control groups suggests that other forms of active interventions (like watching a nature video) might produce similar outcomes to meditation\". [[228]](#cite_note-245) Another study reported increased ability to correctly report others facial expressions over time after meditating using fMRI. [[229]](#cite_note-246) Loving kindness meditation has also been shown to have positive effects on feelings of connection and decreased attention to oneself. [[230]](#cite_note-247) Potential adverse effects[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Meditation&action=edit\u00a7ion=44)] Meditation has been correlated with unpleasant experiences in some people. [[231]](#cite_note-248) [[232]](#cite_note-249) [[233]](#cite_note-250) [[234]](#cite_note-251) In some cases, it has also been linked to psychosis in a few individuals. [[235]](#cite_note-252) In one study, published in 2019, of 1,232 regular meditators with at least two months of meditation experience, about a quarter reported having had particularly unpleasant meditation-related experiences (such as anxiety, fear, distorted emotions or thoughts, altered sense of self or the world), which they thought may have been caused by their meditation practice. Meditators with high levels of repetitive negative thinking and those who only engage in deconstructive meditation were more likely to report unpleasant side effects. Adverse effects were less frequently reported in women and religious meditators. [[236]](#cite_note-plos-253) Difficult experiences encountered in meditation are mentioned in traditional sources; and some may be considered to be just an expected part of the process: for example: seven stages of purification mentioned in [Theravda Buddhism](/wiki/Theravada), or possible \"unwholesome or frightening visions\" mentioned in a practical manual [Shapiro (1982)](#CITEREFShapiro1982)states that \"meditation refers to a family of techniques which have in common a conscious attempt to focus attention in a nonanalytical way and an attempt not to dwell on discursive, ruminating thought\" (p. 6, italics in original). The term \"discursive thought\" has long been used in Western philosophy, and is often viewed as a synonym to logical thought. [[31]](#cite_note-34) [^](#cite_ref-bond09logic_36-0) [Bond et al. (2009)](#CITEREFBondOspinaHootonBialy2009)report that 7 expert scholars who had studied different traditions of meditation agreed that an \"essential\" component of meditation \"Involves logic relaxation: not 'to intend' to analyze the possible psychophysical effects, not 'to intend' to judge the possible results, not 'to intend' to create any type of expectation regarding the process\" (p. 134, Table 4). In their final consideration, all 7 experts regarded this feature as an \"essential\" component of meditation; none of them regarded it as merely \"important but not essential\" (p. 234, Table 4).
