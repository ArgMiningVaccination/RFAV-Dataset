HEATHER RICE? Dr. Rice has over 25+ years of experience in the [Chiropractic profession in Shelburne](https://www.wellspringcls.com). Her connection with Chiropractic started at a young age as both of her parents are Chiropractors. She has a memory of her father adjusting her when she was 13 years old. Dr. Rice remembers because she had strep throat and each adjustment made her feel better. That is when the seed was planted - she too wanted to help people feel better. Two of Dr. Rice's brothers and she went to school to be Chiropractors. She graduated 4th in her class from Palmer College of Chiropractic in 1983 and since then she has become one of the few doctors in Vermont to achieve the highest level of certification in Network Spinal Analysis (NSA). NSA is known for its gentle adjustments and profound changes in the quality of life. Dr. Rice is also certified as a FLOWTRITION practitioner and can also teach this approach. Dr. Rice has traveled the world (especially China & South Korea) practicing Chiropractic but Vermont is her home. Dr. Rice's practice focuses on family wellness care for infants, children, and adults and she is devoted to improving her community. Dr. Rice does this by educating the public in healthier ways to live. Dr. Rice often packs up and travels to offices and schools within the Burlington area to give free lectures or seminars. In addition to being a Chiropractor, Dr. Rice is also trained in Somato Respiratory Integration (SRI) from the Twelve Stages of Healing work, and she has been a staff trainer for the Firewalking Institute of Research and Education. Dr. Rice is proficient in French & Chinese and she loves playing the violin. WHY IS THIS SPECIAL REPORT SO IMPORTANT? The best defense against any disease is a robust immune system which is what our natural state was meant to be. So, supporting the immune system should be a part of all your healthy lifestyle choices. Rather than thinking of ways to deal with exposure to a disease and suddenly needing to ramp up your immune system short term (I have ideas for that, too), the best approach is creating healthy lifestyle habits. Artificially manipulating your immune system with a vaccine to try to stay healthy is not the same thing, nor does it produce the same kind of immunity and sought after disease-fighting result. It may actually make you less healthy in the long run. Below are some of the fairly well known strategies to support a healthy immune system. Dr. Rice further examines these in her special report and tells you the rest of the story in 10 Secrets to a Healthy Immune System! - Eat whole, natural foods - Move your body - Breathe fresh air every day - Get plenty of rest. 6-9 hours a night for adults, and even more for children - Wash your hands, but stay away from the antibacterial soaps and conventional hand sanitizers [Download my special report to discover the other 5 secrets to a healthy immune system!](https://www.wellspringcls.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/VermontHealthyImmuneSystem.pdf) OFFICE HOURS Monday 2:00pm - 6:00pm Tuesday 7:00am - 12:20pm Wednesday 2:00pm - 6:00pm Thursday 7:00am - 12:30pm 3:00pm - 6:00pm Friday Closed Saturday Closed "}
