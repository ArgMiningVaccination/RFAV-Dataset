But in recognition of increasing community interest in complementary care, the Cancer Institute NSW has embarked on a wide-ranging review of alternative treatments in cancer. The head of the institute, Professor Jim Bishop, says the review aims to plug a gap in what's known about complementary therapies used by cancer patients and whether they do any good. Bishop says complementary cancer care can range from \"look good, feel better\" programs for patients experiencing hair loss and body changes to \"faddish\" treatments such as shark cartilage, mistletoe, apricot seed extract and macrobiotic diets. Within that spectrum come counselling, group support, homeopathy, acupuncture and high-dose vitamin therapy. The Journal of the American Medical Association recently reported on a meeting of vitamin E researchers in Boston who reviewed the vitamin's role in health, including warding off cancer. \"If the review says a person needs to have access to education and counselling and that body massage and meditation classes are helpful, then we would see if we could get some of these things introduced into more routine practice,\" says Bishop. \"If, on the other hand, we can identify things where we think there's enough evidence to say they're detrimental, we'll say so.\" There is evidence that one in three cancer patients uses complementary therapies, Bishop says. The head of complementary medicine at Melbourne's RMIT University, Professor Marc Cohen, puts the figure at up to 90 per cent. He says scant funding means scientific data is lacking on a lot of therapies. However, there is \"reasonable evidence\" that patients who use meditation, group support and dietary improvement do better. \"I would suggest that the people who do better and have spontaneous remissions are involved with some sort of complementary treatment or are using treatments that complement their medical care,\" Cohen says. He says there are indications that acupuncture and ginger could mitigate the side-effects of chemotherapy and radiotherapy while antioxidants and phytonutrients may be able to reduce tumour load. He cautions that patients should not embark on complementary treatments without consultation because of the risk of drug-herb and drug-nutrient reactions. Findings of the Cancer Institute's review, which is expected to take several months, will be progressively posted on the institute's "}
