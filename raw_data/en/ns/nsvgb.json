Crystals have unique energetic signatures that resonate with a dog's chakras (energy centres) and their associated nerves, organs and emotions. Choose amethyst for anxiety, black tourmaline for protection and rhodonite for rescue dogs. Can Crystals Help your Pet's Health? Yes. When specific crystals are used near animals, we can notice subtle, positive transformations in areas like stress, pain, focus, bonding, attention and confidence. When we know how to use crystals therapeutically, we can support the physical, emotional and spiritual health of our beautiful Fur Souls. Crystals Have Been Used Throughout History For millennia, crystals have been revered for their beauty and perceived beneficial effects. Although scientific evidence is in its infancy, traditional wisdom has touted the use of crystals for their ability to emit vibrations and frequencies attuned to energy points in the body. Some consider crystals as a form of Energy Medicine, influencing our mind, emotion and physical essence in ways similar to essential oils, light and sound waves, and music. Crystals and Modern Technology Think crystals are just for ancient civilizations and New Agers? Think again. Quartz is one of the most commonly used crystals in manufacturing today due to its ability to convert one form of energy into another (piezoelectric capacity). A variety of crystals are used in lasers, televisions, ultrasound equipment, computers and cell phones. How Do Crystals Work? When physical pressure is applied to a crystal, that mechanical energy converts into electrical (AC voltage) energy - and vice versa. The energy derived from quartz and silicon crystals is commonly directed into sonar and ultrasound technology, computer chips, digital watches, cell phones and microphones. The generated electricity can also provide a spark to ignite gas appliances. The lead in your pencils? Compressed graphite crystals! On the flip side, when an electrical charge is applied to a crystal, it begins to vibrate at unique frequencies, depending on the type of crystal - similar to a tuning fork. The shape of the crystal will actually change a little bit. Ruby crystals were used in the 1960's to develop the first lasers, and are still used today for their ability to focus energy with extreme precision. Liquid crystals reflect certain colour wavelengths and are used in LCD (liquid crystal display) televisions. When we use crystals as part of a holistic healing plan, we don't usually think about the minutia of voltage and compression, however some of us crystal nerds do pay attention to frequencies, colour wavelengths and their clinical ability to affect chakras and health. Crystals and Healing So now we can begin to appreciate the value of crystals for their exquisite ability to receive, process and transmit energy. The ancients used crystals extensively for health, power and beauty, and modern day manufacturers harness their energy in technology. But what about using healing crystals with animals? Crystal Healing for Animals All living beings have points of energy throughout their bodies that absorb, process and send out energies - these are known as chakras. Each chakra has its own unique energetic signature that corresponds to a colour, sound and frequency. Each chakra also corresponds to certain organs, nerves and emotions. Practitioners of Energy Medicine (such as Reiki Therapists) are able to focus life energy (chi/ki) toward these energy points in the body and often use crystals as an added tool to amplify and direct healing energy to needed areas. Animals that are untouched and uninfluenced by humans - such as those in their natural habitat - find innate ways to balance their energies with local organic meat, plants, naturally growing herbs, sun, water, rest and activity. Sometimes, they will even migrate toward natural sources of crystals found in mines or craters. When we adopt animals as pets, we shower them with love but also expose them to unnatural environments, stress and diets that may subtlety affect the energetic health of their chakras. Dog Chakras [Dogs have an exquisite system of chakras](https://healingfursouls.com/chakras-in-dogs/) that connects beautifully with the subtle healing energy of crystals. Since many illnesses begin with subtle shifts in these energy points, crystals are often used to help balance, restore and prevent further unhealthy energy shifts. Energy Medicine Practitioners have the knowledge and experience to match the right crystals with chakras that need balancing. Dogs are particularly attuned to the gentle healing properties of natural crystals and make Healing Crystal Pet Charms an excellent choice as part of their [holistic health care](https://healingfursouls.com/your-dog-needs-more-than-a-vet/) plan. What Can Crystals Help With? Crystals act on a subtle level to help with minor energetic imbalances that occur well before clinical signs of illness and distress. Energy practitioners know that the earliest signs of dis-ease start with nearly imperceptible shifts in the chakras, often years before a person or animal notices that something is wrong. A trained Reiki Therapist can detect these early shifts. We like to maintain perfect health from the earliest stages of life, as this is easier than attempting to reverse illness in its late stages. Offering younger dogs a crystal charm can support well-being and balance before illnesses have time to organize and surface. Hint: We don't recommend crystal pet charms for puppies or dogs who may bite, chew or swallow charms. Best Healing Crystals for Dogs Certain crystals can help with common conditions, especially when used as part of a comprehensive [holistic health care plan that includes targeted nutrition](https://healingfursouls.com/my-dog-survived-cancer/), herbs and energy medicine like Reiki. We like to use these healing crystals with the following conditions: |Condition dogs||Rhodonite, rose quartz| |Lack of confidence, |[Transition](https://healingfursouls.com/do-dogs-have-souls/)to Death How Do I Know Which Crystals Are Best for My Dog? We find most dogs are delighted to be near clear quartz, amethyst, rose quartz and black tourmaline. Certain stages of life and health conditions though, respond best with specific crystals. A Reiki Practitioner can identify subtle changes in your dog's chakras that could benefit from energy balancing through Reiki, and crystals (if your practitioner has that knowledge). Not only does a Reiki session help identify areas that are out of balance, it also directs universal healing energy toward your dog to bring him back into harmony. And [dogs love Reiki!](https://healingfursouls.com/how-do-animals-experience-reiki/) How Can I Choose a Crystal for My Dog? If you'd prefer to choose crystals on your own, we encourage you to read about some common signs and symptoms that could indicate that a particular [chakra is out of harmony](https://healingfursouls.com/chakras-in-dogs/). You can also get your dog to choose his own crystal. Dogs have an inherent ability to choose the herbs, foods and crystals that support their healing. First, purchase a few common crystals that are associated with each of the major dog chakras, such as: - clear quartz - amethyst - lapis lazuli or turquoise - jade - rose quartz - citrine - carnelian - garnet - black tourmaline or onyx Secondly, line them up on the floor about 3-6 inches apart and invite your dog to examine them. Hint: Only do this with dogs that won't eat, swallow or otherwise chew on crystals. Puppies are usually too curious for this exercise. Then, simply notice which one(s) your dog shows interest in e.g. sniffs, plays with, paws at or changes his behaviour. Keep these aside. Notice which one(s) your dog walks away from, stiffens or tenses around. Remove these. Use your dog's chosen crystal(s) in a dog charm or roll it in a bandana to place around his neck. Start by placing it on or near your dog (if he allows it) for a few minutes each day, then cleanse the crystal. Notice how he responds. Always give him the option of being away from it for a while - [dogs can be exquisitely sensitive to healing](https://healingfursouls.com/creating-a-healing-home-for-anxious-dogs/) energies. Always respect your dog's intuition. If he paws at it to remove it, or shows signs of wanting to separate himself from it, respect his innate wisdom. It's possible it just needs to be cleansed of absorbed unhealthy energy, so try that first. How to Cleanse a Crystal We aren't talking about a bubble bath here. Proper cleansing is about using energy to remove unhelpful frequencies that stone absorbs, and restoring the crystal to its natural healthful state. When you first use crystals with your dog, place it on or near him for only a few minutes per day. Then cleanse it. [Cleanse crystals](https://healingfursouls.com/cleanse-crystals/) by putting the crystal in a bowl of salt for 24 hours, making sure to cover it completely with the salt. Alternatively, hold it until running water for a few minutes. If you want to really power it up after that, set it in a windowsill to absorb sunlight and moonlight for a full additional 24 hours. There you have it - good as new. Healing Crystal Pet Charms We absolutely love the idea of using healing crystals in exquisite pet jewelry! Who doesn't love bling?
