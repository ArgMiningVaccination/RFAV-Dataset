Yes, many chiropractors avoid vaccination. As a matter of fact, I have taken care of dozens of their children, and to no one's surprise, many of them developed pertussis (whooping cough), with severe coughing which lasts from 10 to 26 weeks. No, none of the patients in our office who were vaccinated caught it from them - fortunately. A chiropractor, interviewed in the article, claims that the body should heal itself. If that were the case, then there would not have been 145,000 children around the world who died of measles in 2013. According to the World Health Organization, [15.6 million deaths were prevented by vaccinations](http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs286/en/) between 2000 and 2013. Precious children. Only the unvaccinated were dying. If we were to stop vaccinating in the United States, we could see that failed experiment occur again in our own homes. And it would include deaths from all the other horrible diseases that we have worked so hard to eradicate: varicella, meningitis, polio, diptheria and more. Vaccinations are not a joke, or a manipulation by doctors, pharmaceutical companies or the government. They are the greatest medical miracle in history. Ask your grandparents what it was like to live in an era of paralytic polio or rampant bacterial meningitis. The unvaccinated chiropractor lives in a community where everyone else's vaccine protects him, allowing him to snidely think he knows the answers to infectious disease. Please don't spread the wrong message. Our children's lives are at stake. Pay attention to our brilliant scientists. Get your children vaccinated.
