It can be challenging to know what type of treatment each term is referring to. When it comes to finding a treatment that will work for you, it is essential to know what options are available. For the sake of this article, let's take a look at three general approaches to medicine, including allopathic, homeopathic, and osteopathic, as each form of health care complements one another. Allopathic vs. Homeopathic vs. Osteopathic Medicine [Allopathic medicine](https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/allopathic-medicine) is a system of medicine that involves medical doctors, nurses, therapists, and other healthcare professionals. The nature of allopathic medicine consists of the applications of medications and surgery to treat diseases and symptoms associated with many conditions. Specifically, allopathic medicine focuses on the use of pharmacological drugs and other physical interventions to treat or suppress diseases and other health conditions. Allopathic medicine is also commonly referred to as conventional medicine, traditional medicine, Western medicine, mainstream medicine, and evidence-based medicine. [Homeopathic medicine](https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/homeopathy) is typically understood as the opposite of allopathic medicine. Homeopathic medicine embraces the body's natural healing abilities without the administering of pharmacological drugs. Homeopathy is a medical concept that focuses on the belief that the body can cure itself. Those that practice homeopathic medicine use natural substances, such as vitamins and minerals, to stimulate the body's healing process. Homeopathic doctors believe that natural substances are the most potent remedies for healing. Although there are mixed results regarding homeopathic medicine's efficacy, there is little evidence to support the practice as a leading treatment for any specific health condition. Osteopathic medicine is another type of healthcare concept. Osteopathic medicine treats conditions from a whole-body approach, precisely manipulating and massaging muscles, bones, and joints. Osteopathic medicine focuses on treating conditions and taking preventative measures to combat illnesses before they ever begin. This approach utilizes the benefits of modern medicine, such as prescription drugs and physical surgery, while looking beyond just symptoms to understand all factors that contribute to an individual's well-being. What Do Allopathic Doctors Do? Allopathic doctors have the title of MD, which stands for \"Doctor of Medicine.\" Allopathic doctors and physicians do most of the mainstream, stereotypical things that typical doctors do. They examine patients, conduct evaluations and tests, diagnose, and provide treatment. Some specialties in allopathy include: - Surgery - Neurology - Oncology - Family Medicine - Pediatrics - Cardiovascular medicine - Dermatology - Orthopedics - Internal medicine These types of doctors might choose to focus their careers on research or teaching while specializing in a specific field. Allopathic doctors may work in private practices, hospitals, medical centers, [mental](https://westcoastrecoverycenters.com/benefits-of-yoga-in-addiction-recovery/) health facilities, and clinics. Allopathic doctors rely on FDA-approved medications to treat their patients, perform surgeries, and use radiation to make assessments and provide treatment specific to diagnosed health conditions. Those who work in allopathic medicine also aim to encourage preventative measures, especially highlighting the use of vaccinations, antibiotics, and screenings. Like all effective healthcare workers, allopathic doctors also educate patients and clients about their physical and mental health, especially diet and fitness. Some other examples of work that allopathic doctors may do include: - Admitting new patients - Making referrals for patients - Performing physical examinations - Performing diagnostic tests - Interpreting diagnostic tests - Administering vaccinations - Prescribing medications - Conducting surgeries - Educating patients and families - Educating other medical professionals - Conducting further research What Are the Benefits of Allopathic Medicine? Allopathic medicine is science-based, meaning that [treatments ](https://westcoastrecoverycenters.com/co-occurring-treatment-modalities/)and therapies have been thoroughly researched to enhance an individual's quality of life. Allopathic medicine focuses on treating the root cause of an issue and removing it to the best of its ability. This approach to healthcare follows specific guidelines to treat and cure life-threatening illnesses and injuries by relying on the most advanced, evidence-based forms of treatment. People see an allopathic doctor for a lot of reasons, such as treating symptoms of the cold and flu, digestive issues, back pain, menstrual problems, and mental distress. Several benefits of allopathic medicine include: - It is one of the most readily available approaches to medicine. Nearly all medical facilities offer allopathic treatment of some kind. - All allopathic doctors and nurses are licensed, which provides legal protection for both the patients and the doctors that provide treatment. - New treatments and medicines are being developed daily. Significant investments surround the research and development of allopathic medicine, making it a leading approach to treating and curing illness. - Patients have access to the best treatments and medicines available to help aid in the healing process. Allopathic medicine, also known as modern medicine or conventional medicine, is a critical healthcare approach to preventing, treating, and curing many illnesses. Allopathic medicine focuses on the use of pharmaceutical drugs and other physical interventions to treat the underlying causes of specific medical or mental conditions. Allopathic medicine is one approach to wellness, next to homeopathic and osteopathic medicine routes.
