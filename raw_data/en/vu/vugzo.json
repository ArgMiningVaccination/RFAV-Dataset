The approach we use is based on our judgment, years of experience and what you - the patient would like. If you have been to a Chiropractor before and prefer to be adjusted in a certain way, please let Kirsten know. NeuroImpulse Protocol: What NIP? NeuroImpulse Protocol is the name given to certain Chiropractic Technique. It has a full body assessment that has a more neurological basis. It involves an in depth neurological exam of reflexes, muscle tests and includes testing ranges of motion of spinal joints, extremity joints, joints at the front of the body or the cranium. This helps to direct the chiropractor to the exact location to adjust. How NIP works. Your brain is the main processor of information in your body. It controls all communication in every cell in your body. Your brain continually receives incoming information from your body, the brain processes or sorts this info and sends out coming information in response to it. If your brain receives faulty or inadequate incoming info in the form of pain or altered joint mechanics (loss of movement) this will change the out going and therefore you may develop a change in posture, altered joint position and mechanics or a limp. These can make you even more susceptible to more aches and pains than the ones you originally started with. The Adjustment The NIP adjustment is a very precise, quick and gentle correction made to the area of primary problem. No cracks or pops will be heard. It is not intended to move or shift any joint but change brain function. Therefore restoring normal neurological function and repositioning your body through the Central Nervous System. Diversified: First, an analysis of your spine and body is performed. This can initially involve a case history and X-ray pictures of your spine or other body part. Subsequent visits may include motion palpation, with the chiropractor feeling the spinal joints move as you turn and bend. Or, a leg check may be performed, to uncover an imbalance in the neck or lower spine. With the malposition of one or more spinal bones identified, a specific manual thrust is administered or with the assistance of a treatment table drop piece. The direction, speed, depth and angle that are used is the result of years of experience, practice and a thorough understanding of spinal and joint mechanics. The energy delivered during the thrust may produce a slight \"popping\" sound from the shifting of gas and fluids in the joint. This sound may be interesting, but is not a guide as to the value or effectiveness of the adjustment. While improving spinal biomechanics can reduce nervous system interferences, virtually all joints of the body can be adjusted to help restore proper range of motion. Activator methods: We use one of the most popular \"low force\" chiropractic techniques in the world. First the Evaluation We begin by analysing how well your spine moves. We test how well you turn and bend. While you're lying face down, we'll evaluate the length of your legs. This simple procedure can reveal significant differences in leg lengths. This time-tested protocol tells us if subluxations exist and their location. It also helps us know when to adjust and when not to adjust. The Adjusting Instrument The Activator Methods\u00ae Adjusting Instrument is a handheld spring-loaded tool that delivers a consistent low-force, high-speed thrust. Because it's many times faster than adjustments delivered by hand, the body rarely tightens to resist, making adjustments comfortable and effective. It's also helpful for adjusting elbows, wrists, knees and other joints of the body. The Follow Up After your adjustment, we retest to make sure changes have been produced. Testing afterwards helps us deliver high-quality care and high levels. Soft Tissue Release: After full examination we are able to assess the amount of muscular, tendon and ligamentous tension present. To compliment the adjustment the most effective technique will be used to release this tension, maximising symptom relief. The techniques we offer are; various forms of massage, trigger point therapy, active and passive stretching and cross friction. Acupuncture / Dry Needling: Using a more modern western approach. This method of treating aliments complements the Chiropractic adjustments perfectly. The Chiropractic adjustments address problems within the joints and nervous system. The Acupuncture addresses soft tissue problems e.g Muscles, Ligaments and Tendons. Exercise and Rehabilitation: If it is felt necessary after a detailed history and examination, we will be able to prescribe a tailor made rehabilitation exercise and stretching programme specific for your needs. These exercises are to compliment the adjustments and if followed correctly will make you stronger, allowing your body to support itself, preventing reoccurrence (maintenance). The stretches are designed to pull out tension within certain muscle groups, whilst the rehab exercises (core stability) are designed to strengthen areas of weakness. As you see improvements in flexibility and strength the exercises can be progressed to makes things harder, making you even stronger again. Patients who put time and effort into this area of their care see longer lasting results. "}
