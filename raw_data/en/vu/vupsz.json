I have covered LOTS of information in the past 10 months with this series. All of the past columns are available for review at the Neighbors Newspaper website, www.NeighborsNewspaper.com or at my own website, www.DonohoeChiropractic.com. The questions that have been discussed so far have included: 1. Are vaccinated children healthier than non-vaccinated children? 2. Do the benefits of vaccination outweigh the risks? 3. What are the real numbers of children being hurt? 4. Are vaccinations \"effective\"? 5. Are vaccine doses personalized? 6. Can vaccines cause damage that may not surface for years? 7. Can vaccines cause crib death (SIDS)? 8. Did vaccines eliminate diseases? 9. What if we stopped vaccinating? 10. How many people are really getting diseases? 11. What's in a vaccine? 12. Are there benefits to acute illness? 13. What's the difference between natural immunity and artificial immunity? 14. How do vaccines cause damage? 15. Can vaccines cause autism? The pharmaceutical companies that manufacture, distribute and compensate our medical doctors for administering vaccines have tried to prove that they are indispensable with \"vaccine science\". Let's listen to what some of those who have tried to speak up only to be quietly, but efficiently silenced have to say... 16. Does research support vaccination efficacy/safety? When scientists have objectively looked at vaccine research, their conclusions are often startling. Dr. Bart Classen is a former National Institutes of Health researcher. He says this... \"My data proves that the studies used to support immunization are so flawed that it is impossible to say if immunization provides a net benefit to anyone or to society in general. This question can only be determined by proper studies which have never been performed.\" John B. Classen, M.D., M.B.A. This, from a medical doctor who worked for the NIH! Dr. J. Anthony Morris was Chief Control Officer of the Food and Drug Administration. He was fired the day after making this statement. \"There is a great deal of evidence to prove that immunization of children does more harm than good.\" His firing served as a warning to others working for the FDA and other government agencies. If they questioned vaccinations they could look for another job. He fought and got his job back. He later criticized President Ford's swine flu vaccination program, saying that there was no swine flu coming and the flu vaccine was very dangerous. He was right on both counts, but lost his job again after saying it! Dr. Thomas Jefferson, board member of the European Programme for Improved Vaccine Safety Surveillance. Most MMR studies are meaningless, investigator claims... \"There is some good research, but it is overwhelmed by the bad. The public has been let down because proper studies have not been done.\" Thomas Jefferson, M.D. Dr. Jefferson added: \"In most of the studies we assessed, it was almost impossible to ascertain what had actually been done.\" Please take note here. All three of these references where made by Medical Doctors. Three men who were involved deeply in the research supposed to have been justifying and proving the safety of childhood vaccination programs. 17. Is there a conflict of interest in vaccine policy? Members of government vaccine committees may own patents for vaccines, own stock in drug companies that make vaccines and actually work for drug companies. The government approves vaccine mandates based on the recommendation of its committees. Why is bad science accepted by government committees? It is because the people on the committees, the people who decide if a vaccine is safe, effective and if it should be given to your child, also work for the companies that make vaccines! This is from an article by Doug Collins, that appeared in the Washington Free Press, January 23, 2003. \"Researchers who persist in probing vaccine safety can see their funding dry up. Dr. John Martin, a pioneer investigator into the transmission of stealth viruses from monkeys to humans, lost his funding when he continued to research the relationship of vaccines to such viral transmission. Other researchers have simply lost their jobs.\" Collins D. Washington Free Press, January 23, 2003 Michael Belkin's baby died 23 hours after receiving a hepatitis B vaccine. The autopsy showed brain swelling, a sign of vaccine damage. Mr. Belkin, a professional economist, began analyzing government vaccination statistics and attending government hearings on vaccination. He is quoted in a UPI Investigative report saying this... \"Parents need to understand that the system providing the vaccines injected into their children's veins is corrupt and scientifically flawed.\" Michael Belkin in UPI Investigates: The Vaccine Conflict By Mark Benjamin, Investigations Editor, 7/20/2003. What follows is a statement of the ASSOCIATION OF AMERICAN PHYSICIANS & SURGEONS To: U.S. House of Representatives, The Subcommittee on Criminal Justice, Drug Policy, and Human Resources of the Committee on Government Reform. Submitted by Jane Orient, M.D. June 14, 1999. \"It is apparent that critical medical decisions for an entire generation of American children are being made by small committees whose members have incestuous ties with agencies that stand to gain power, or manufacturers that stand to gain enormous profits, from the policy that is made.\" 18. Can you leally avoid vaccination? \"When we give government the power to make medical decisions for us, we, in essence, accept that the state owns our bodies.\" U.S. Representative Ron Paul To whom do your children belong? You or the state? In the US there are three kinds of vaccination exemption: religious (in all states except West Virginia and Mississippi), medical (every state), and philosophical (in about 30 states). The Canadian Constitution permits exemption from vaccination. There are vaccine exemptions in every state. Unfortunately most health department officials, school officials and medical offices don't know the law and try to intimidate or coerce parents into vaccinating their children. They almost never discuss adverse reactions, telling the parents that the vaccines are perfectly safe or the only reaction may be a sore arm, slight fever or fussiness. That is untrue, but in their defense, they have been taught that vaccines are very safe and reactions are exceedingly rare. Also they are usually untrained to recognize vaccine damage and therefore are unable to report it. I'd like to end this discussion with these words by Marcel Proust... \"Even the wisest of doctors are relying on scientific truths, the errors of which will be recognized within a few years time.\" Vaccinations will one day go the way of bloodletting. Doctors of tomorrow would be shocked that, without any good research showing any benefit and with much research showing harm, we continued using this bizarre, 18th century medical practice of injecting viri, bacteria, toxins and other chemicals into our children well into the 21st century.
