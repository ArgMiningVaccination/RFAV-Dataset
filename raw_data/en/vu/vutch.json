Chakra Meditation is \"a journey through the energy centres in the subtle body\" with the help of chanting the mantras and visualizing the colour of each chakra... The mantra of the ajna or third eye chakra is 'OM' and its colour is indigo. One is then led to create an energy circle around oneself which helps one to \"locate the exact position of each chakra and feel its rotation; increase the inner guidance, intuition and clairvoyance; keep the pathway of Kundalini Shakti free of blockages for natural awakening.\" VISUALIZATION : In Reiki Distant Healing, you visualize the patient in front of you. You \"fix your third eye contact\" on him for the whole session and then go through the normal routine of cleansing, energizing and so on.In Reiki Golden Ball Massage, you visualize a golden ball splitting into tinier ones and massage them into your skin. For Reiki Breathing, \"inhale blue colour for healing and energising inner wounds, exhale white, seeing [visualizing] the toxic energies leave your body, and dispose of them in violet fire.\" SYMBOLS: In the Level II programme, Sukumaran instructs the students in the use of a number of esoteric symbols- their names and pronunciation, purpose, how to draw them, and where to. They can be 'drawn' using one's fingers [physically], by mental projection using the third eye, and at the aura or spiritual level. There is theShantior Peace symbol for healing the past and living harmoniously in the present. A 'Hosanna' symbol used for clearing and healing. Even aCross, the compulsory final symbol for the act of sealing the energy. Others are theCrescent and Star, and theSwastikato be used on your doorstep to ward away evil. TheOMis of course always unavoidable. "}
