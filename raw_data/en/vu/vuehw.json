Need to be feasible! $$$ If an event occurs in 1 per 10,000, in a study with 20,000 people you might expect 2 cases, and in a study with 60,000 you might expect 6 cases. If a vaccine increases the risk for these sorts of quite rare events then you would need some rather large numbers to exclude the possibility of the increased risk. *Or immunogenicity if bridging data to correlate of protection Limitations of clinical trials Usually in healthy people at low risk for adverse events and most likely to make good immune response Cannot measure indirect effects I.ecommunity immunity, transmission Participants might not be genetically diverse Q.

Today up to 178million persons Cool tools and global collaborations Brighton Collaboration Est. 1999 Improving the quality of vaccine safety data \"Enhance the science of vaccine research, by providing standardized, validated and objective methods for monitoring safety profiles and benefit to risk ratios of vaccines.\" Over the years BC have developed many case definitions and guidelines -essential tools for assessing vaccine safety outcomes The traditional vaccine development model was never going to serve us well in an emergency CEPI is a global partnership founded in 2017 in Norway to advance innovations that could prepare us for emerging epidemics. By the end of 2019 they had invested in a range of vaccine technologies such as viral vector and RNA vaccine platforms so that they could progress faster. New vaccine technologies pose new challenges for vaccine safety assessment from benchtop to first in humans... Templates for new vaccines What should we look for?Proven association with immunization Proven association with a vaccine platform and/or adjuvant relevant to CEPI vaccine development Theoretical concern based on immunopathogenesis Theoretical concern related to viral replication during wild type disease Theoretical concern because it has been demonstrated in an animal model with one or more candidate vaccine platforms Body System AESI ICD-10 codes Myocarditis Acute cardiac injury Arrythmia Septic shock-like syndrome Acute kidney injury The most urgent immediate task for most countries is to establish the normal background rates for the adverse events of special interest. Q. What is the risk of neurological side effects/long term effects? A. Very low. There are few examples of modern vaccines causing serious long -term adverse events most recent is Yellow Fever/ Dengvaxia and H1N1/Pandemrix Biological plausibility lacking for many of the platforms RNA, protein -based Need to consider complications of COVID -19 and theoretical concerns, vaccine platforms, proven association a vaccine, theoretical from animal model5 Dec 2020 -FOR LATE STAGE COVID CANDIDATES No signals from animal models No signals from Phase I/II immunogenicity data Pfizer and Moderna RNA combined ~75,000 participants to date, no signals Janssen and Ox/AZ viral vectors combined ~120,000 Q. What about enhanced disease? Having antibodies that do not actually neutralise the virus, or antibodies that form immune complexes can lead to enhanced disease Dengue fever Respiratory syncytial virus Animal model of unadjuvanted inactivated coronavirus vaccine Evidence against this so far for COVID vaccines Not seen in animal models Not seen in human immunogenicity studies Not seen in people receiving convalescent sera Not seen in the clinical trials...but early days Nature Microbiol 2020 But this is being watched closely Knowing the safety of COVID -19 vaccines COVID -19 vaccine safety profilesClinical trialsPassive surveillanceEnhanced surveillanceRapid cycle safety monitoring - AESIs Phase IV and post - marketing studiesGoing BIGGER! Distributed networks Using common methods/protocols at different sites, different countries Combining outcomes in a kind of meta -analysis If everyone uses the same approaches, same definitions then we can combine findings Distributed networks -Europe Distributed Networks -Global Endorsements from Brighton Collaboration and CEPI Conclusions: The preclinical and clinical data gives us some optimism that COVID - 19 vaccines will have a good safety profile. We will safety data beyond the clinical trials quickly and in diverse populations providing we use the tools at our disposal. We can detect and verify rare adverse events.
