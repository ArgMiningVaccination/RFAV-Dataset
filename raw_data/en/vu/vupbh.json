I recently posted this on my blog about the subject:](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21683918-stephen-martino) With the recent talk of vaccinations highlighted during the Republican Presidential debates, it definitely highlights the concerns that linger among us parents about having our children vaccinated. I must preface this post (before getting to my point by discussing a recent article in the neurological literature) by stating that I am a neurologist with 5 children and all were fully vaccinated. That said, I must admit that the vaccinations were spaced apart further than that which was recommended by the pediatrician. The only reason my wife and I were adamant about altering the dosing regimen was that we routinely witnessed an alteration in our childrens' mental status after they received a barrage of shots. I would like to say that flu-like symptoms or low-grade fevers precipitated the changes. However, there were no signs or symptoms of any physical reaction to the vaccines. What did change on occasion was their personalities, sleep habits and at times cognition. It was scary to witness, but we were relieved when it resolved. As we began to split up the vaccination shots for our younger children, these neurological sided effects abated. The reason why I discuss my own experience is that the medical system ardently insists that autism is not related to vaccinations. However, a recent medical journal I read does raise the awareness about the possible neurological sequela that can occur after one of these shots. A July 1 article in Science Translational Medicine discussed the link between Pandemrix, a vaccine used during the H1N1 flu pandemic, and 1,300 reported new cases of narcolepsy which occurred after receiving the shot. The article described how antibodies that formed as a result of the vaccine crossed the blood-brain barrier and attacked the sleep regulation portion of the brain. As a result, these people were left with narcolepsy. The process is called molecular mimicry. It has already been documented as the cause of different neurological diseases that result from the body's immunological response to certain cancers, infections or exposures. If a vaccine can cause narcolepsy, it definitely calls into question whether vaccines could also initiate other neurological problems such as autism. Though the question remains, the overall benefit of vaccines to society as a whole does outweigh the risks. My only recommendation to the medical establishment is to reconsider both the dose of the vaccine and the timing they are given, to reduce any of these possible side effects. message 8: by [James](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7840184-james-morcan)(last edited 18.

Especially as this is a very confusing subject for the layman to assess properly. There seems to be a little paranoia on one side and then blind faith on the other side of this debate...I've always felt the truth might lie somewhere in between those two extremes... That's really worrying that you suspect vaccines could potentially cause autism and that a vaccine crossed the blood-brain barrier (especially as I seem to recall mainstream science has until now been repeatedly saying vaccine ingredients cannot cross the blood-brain barrier!). Interesting that you also recommend staggering the vaccination schedule to make them safer on children's brains. Anyway, I agree the overall benefit of vaccines to society as a whole probably does outweigh the risks, but don't think we should let that stop us pushing for more scientific research on vaccines and greater safety methods. And I completely disagree with those who say \"just trust the science and the pharmaceutical companies and stop asking questions\". message 9: by [Iona](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5485612-iona-stewart)(new) [I\u00b4ve seen horrific photos of babies damaged by vaccines.

I worked in Apartheid South Africa for just under a decade, and in nutritionally marginalised and/or oppressed populations, the early childhood viral illness e.g. measles can be the straw that breaks the camel's back. So I've seen many deaths contributed of caused by Measles, Pertussis and Tetanus. I've also had Measles , Mumps and Rubella...our mum nursed us through no problems. Indeed in the three years prior to MMR vaccination being introduced to England and Wales, the mortality from these had virtually zeroed out. Equity of income, a wholesome environment and nurturing relationships have been the main drivers of Public health in the 20th Century. Vaccination's claims are hyperbole. Moreover, women who have suffered Mumps as a child have a degree of protection from Ovarian Cancer this is forfeited by those who are vaccinated. Medicine is now offering the Measles vaccine as a pharmaceutical agent for breast cancer- my hunch is that the wild measles virus may offer a degree of protection against breast cancer. We have co-evolved with the early childhood illnesses over thousands if not millions of years. They may harm, but well do us good! I have seen the rise of rise of antibiotics abuse in veterinary and human health for years - and now were are reaping the consequences with antibiotic resistance. Indiscriminate poly-vaccination is a mistake. We are seeing emerging epidemics of auto-immune disease, childhood cancer and childhood developmental issues e.g. Autism. Over half of all completed biomedical research is not published, and the raw data on which medical dogma is based is not open to third party scrutiny-the cornerstone of scientific method. Unintended consequence of vaccination are not adequately investigated, and swept under the carpet. This is across the whole spectrum of medicine. We need Compassion vs Greed, Transparency vs Secrecy , and Justice for those damaged by vaccines vs the scapegoating and vilification of caring parents which is becoming the norm.

No apparent problems. BUT now infants are injected with a plethora of vaccines , some of which are developed in animal culture mediums. e.g. Primates for Hep B vaccine till 2003. But of more significance, currently in Australia , visitors to the UK in the 80's are requested not to donate blood to the Red Cross Blood Banks service, because of concerns about Prions , tiny infectious particles that represent a contamination from non-human species. I am not aware that these are screened for. Over the past generation we have witnessed slowly evolving epidemics of childhood cancer, auto-immune disease, and neuro-developmental disorders e.g. Autism. Something bad has happened to the evolving human genome. Of course the human species has co-evolved with infectious agents over millions of years , Indeed we share 8% of our genes with ancient viruses- BUT something is going wrong, and recently! Public health research would be bankrupt without the input of the Pharmaceutical industry- and there's the double edged sword. I'm not suggesting the pharmaceutic industry is wilfully malevolent. It's just human NOT to look too carefully at our flaws or \"unintended consequences.\" Meanwhile, parents grieve for a lost child or a damaged child. Some from vaccine preventable illness, and some (increasingly) from a vaccine episode of care apparently gone wrong. The latter group will be dismissed ( I have in the past.)

By the way, before anyone throws around the usual glib reactions like \"oh, you are anti-science\" or \"obviously anti-vaccines\", let me state I am pro-vaccines. However, I am still critical of the way vaccine research is conducted and revealed (or sometimes not revealed). Therefore think there need to be greater safety controls (from independent, unbiased parties) as as our society's management of vaccines evolve. So I think it's a much more nuanced debate than pro-vaccines vs. anti-vaccines. I'd also freely admit I'm very confused by all the conflicting reports, misinformation, pseudoscience, Big Pharma cover-ups, etc, etc. It's hard to get accurate information. For example, at around the 51 minute mark of this video, Dr. Rhonda Patrick (a leading American biomedical scientist who is very pro vaccines like I am) mentions that despite all the benefits of vaccines, current vaccine protocols (e.g. too many vaccines all at once) are potentially suspect or dangerous. She is a new mother and will only vaccine her infant one at a time (singles) instead of the dozens they usually give all at once (this is what Japanese scientists recommend for safety)...She also mentions there are studies, especially in primates if I understood her correctly, that appear to show there is a potential link with vaccines and autoimmune disorders and even autism!

Similarly, without vaccination, there would be huge deaths from smallpox. In Victorian times, TB was a great killer, and now we rarely see it. I refuse to believe there are no benefits, and if you can persuade enough people to vaccinate, you can exterminate a virus. Of course with jet travel, those benefits get eroded because you can't get everyone vaccinated, and herein lies a problem - in any society, if a significant number refuse to vaccinate, then the overall society benefit for future generations is lost.](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14438422-ian-miller) From a personal view, we vaccinated out children, but not with everything, and I do think there has to be a risk/benefit analysis. Mumps is one of those things that are relatively harmless if you get them when young, but more serious for adult males. Now I am getting old, every year I get the latest flu vaccination. This is voluntary, but I get it because flu at my age has a fair probability of being a death sentence, and I am not ready to cark it yet. Of course BIg Pharma is out to make money, but that does not mean they don't care about the quality of their products. Ever heard of law suits? They won't deliberately make crap, although they do push products that in certain areas, like cancer, offer minimal benefits. But inoculations are different. The mechanism is reasonably well understood. On the other hand, whenever you introduce something into the body that was not intended to be there, there is a risk of an adverse reaction, and for some people, the reaction can be more severe.

Remember the case of that 'quack' doctor that died trying to educate his collegues that washing your hands after cutting up cadavers before delivering babies was not only the right thing but a good thing? Polio was decreasing before the vaccine was invented. It's BS myth from pro-vaxxers. Again not giving credit where it's due and forgetting the real solution, like the eradication of open sewers via implementation of copper plumbing. Syria isn't lacking vaccines, it's lacking modern society that doesn't have faecal contaminated drinking water. It's just nuts. Yet common sense and most don't see it. Bandaid solutions just make the problems worse. As for military personnel wasn't Gulf War Syndrome and PTSD possibly linked to all the chemical warfare antidotes and vaccines? Though I may have confused it with the massive signals frequencies that was covertly drenched over Iraq. Though that could be disinfo to cover for the vaccine, or the new secret technologies. Apparently some believe it was used to make the enemy go nuts and surrender to the Americans, but further reading suggest that's BS as they were inadequately untrained and underresourced. Many of them only had one or two bullets each because the Generals was corrupt and sold off all the ammunition they could. Off topic but interesting to see if anyone else has anything on this. A bit like the PR stunt by the diplomat's daughter in D.C. testifying about horrible conditions in Iraq and the made-up story of how babies were thrown out of their incubators at hospitals. Big Pharma hypes up these outbreaks and squeals 'See! We need vaccines! The herd immunity just needs to work!' And what a whole crock of crap 'herd immunity' is. In today's world of jet travel and drug-resistance we'll never get there. It's BS. Many diseases aren't possible to truly eradicate, so why bother? Best to just cull the weak naturally and focus on building up and maintaining strong immune systems. Herd immunity in some vaccines are only obtained by having 99.9% coverage and some 100%. So what's the freaking point? It's just big bucks to Big Pharma! message 31: by [Ian](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14438422-ian-miller)(new) [Adam, when did you last have a smallpox vaccination?

Good diet, regular exercise is the key. Once you are in the hands of doctors it becomes experimentation and expensive. If vaccines keep the doctors away then it seems having them is best. message 38: by [Ian](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14438422-ian-miller)(new) [I think we have to be fair to big pharma. Whatever else they did, they had nothing to do with the outbreak of ebola, and I doubt very much they made anything out of it. Also, from what I gather, big pharma does not get excessively rich by selling vaccines. They may cost quite a bit, but the costs in making them is also very high. The big profits (apart from the odd rare situation such as the one used by Martin Schkreli) come from cancer drugs and the diseases of aging because these are the ones for which the rich and desperate will pay everything they have. The rice of most vaccines is reasonable, given the cost of making them. The fact that a lot of vaccines were spoiled because of inadequate refrigeration is also hardly the fault of big pharma. The problems of the third world are real, but they are not relevant to the discussion of whether vaccines are a good idea or not.](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14438422-ian-miller) Some people will have adverse reactions to a vaccine. The question then is, is there a longer term consequence, or is it merely not feeling so good for a few days? If people claim a longer term consequence, is it solely, or at all, due to the vaccine? The problem here is we have too many questions and perhaps not enough answers, but my view is, by far the most people who get vaccines have no long term ill effects, so they are clearly a net benefit if used wisely. The battery of shots may not be wise. message 39: by [Michael](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7500502-michael-cabus)(new) [I think our greatest health risk at least in the US is not from vaccines but rather poor diet and lack of exercise. Diabetes and other resultant diseases are tough on the body and have severe implications for quality of life. Instead of focusing our efforts at vaccines we'd do more good to go after fast food and unhealthy food that is so readily available. Processed foods pose more risk than any vaccine.

I know this from personal experience in having a rare disease. There is no doctor who knows about my disease more than me. And yes, I could set my own bone- I have no access to an x-ray machine except at the veterinarian, unbelievably; I relocate my joints every single day- and sometimes my childrens'. When I broke my arm in three places I had to go to the vet for an xray. luckily ther were 2 hairline fractures and a chip on the radius that still hurts because it's floating around my wrist... I don't agree that vaccines keep the doctors away. Vaccines keep new parents bringing their kids in for \"well baby visits\" every 1-6 months for the first 2 years of their lives. What is it now? 3 days, 30 days, 2 months, 3 months, 4 months, 6 months, 9 months, 12 months, 15 months, 18 months, 2 years then annually - or something very close to that.

But you cannot cure a genetic disease that already exists- so I stay away from the doctors except for palliative care- which is no good either. mmm that oxycontin is delicious... but it's $250/bottle!
