Ablation may be performed by surger y, hormones, drugs, radiofrequenc y, heat, or other methods. actinomycin D (AK-tih-noh-MY-sin ...) Also called Cosmegen and Dactinomycin. A drug used treat Ewing sarcoma, gestational trophoblastic tumo r, Wilms tumo r, and certain types of testicular cance r. It is also used to treat rhabdomyosarcoma in children. It is being studied in the treatment of other types of cance r. Actinomycin D comes from the bacterium Streptomyces parvulus. It damages the cell 's DNA and may kill cancer cells. It i s a type of anticancer antibiotic. active surveillance (AK-tiv ser-VAY-lents) A treatment plan that involves closely watching a patient 's condition but not giving any treatment unless there are changes in test results that show the condition is getting worse. Active surveillance may be used to avoid or delay the need for treatments such as radiation therapy or surger y, which can cause side e ffects or other problems. During active surveillance, certain exams and tests are done on a regular schedule. It may be used in the treatment of certain types of cance r, such as prostate cance r, urethral cance r, and intraocular (eye) melanoma. It is a type of expectant management. AD Chemotherap y regime that consists of Doxorubicin (SEE Dox -SL, below) and Dacarbazine (below). [From adjunct therapy (A-junkt THAYR-uh-pee) Also called Adjunctive therap y.

This type of rad iation may cause less damage to nearby healthy tissue. Alpha emitter radiation therapy is used to treat prostate cancer that has spread to the bone, and it is being studied in the treatment of other types of cance r. alternative medicine (all-TER-nuh-tiv MEH -dih-sin) Treatments that are used instead of standard treatments. Standard treatments are based on the results of scientific research and are currently accepted and widely used. Less research has been done for most types of alternative medicine. Alternative medicine may include special diets, megadose vitamins, herbal preparations, special teas, and magnet therap y. For example, a special diet may be used instead of anticancer drugs as a treatment for cance r. ANC Also called Absolute Neutrophil Count. A measure of the number of neutrophils in the blood. Neutrophils are a type of white blood cell. They help the body fight infection. An ANC may be used to check for infection, inflammation, leukemia, and other conditions. The lower a person's ANC is, the higher the risk is of getting an infection. Having an ANC of less than 500 means there is a high risk of getting an infecti on. Cancer treatment, such as chemotherap y, may reduce the ANC. AP23573 Also called Ridaforolimus. A substance being studied in the treatment of soft tissue and bone cancers. It is also being studied in the treatment of other solid tumors and hematologic cance r. AP23573 stops cells from dividing and may cause cancer cells to die.

CAT scan (... skan) Also called Computed Tomography scan, Computerized Axial Tomography scan, Computerized Tomograph y, and CT scan. A procedure that uses a computer linked to an x -ray machine to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the bod y. The pictures are taken from di fferent angles and are used to create 3 -dimensional (3 -D) views of tissues and organs. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the tissues and organs show up more clearl y. A CAT scan may be used to help diagnose disease, plan treatment, or find out how well treatment is working. cause -specific survival (kawz -speh -SIH-fik ser-VY-vul) Also called CSS. The length of time from either the date of diagnosis or the start of treatment for a disease, such as cance r, to the date of death from the disease. Patients who die from causes unrelated to the disease are not counted in this measurement. In a clinical trial, measuring the cause - specific survival is one way to see how well a new treatmen t works. chemoimmunotherapy (KEE -moh-IH-myoo -noh-THAYR-uh-pee) Chemotherapy combined with immunotherap y. Chemotherapy uses different drugs to kill or slow the growth of cancer cells; immunoth erapy uses treatments to stimulate or restore the ability of the immune system to fight cance r. chemoradiation (KEE -moh-RAY-dee-AY-shun) Also called Chemoradiotherap y.

These studies test new methods of screening, prevention, diagnosis, or treatment of a disease. clinical trial phase (KLIH -nih-kul TRY-ul fayz) A part of the clinical research process that answers specific questions about whether treatments that are being studied work and are safe. Phase I trials test the best way to give a new treatment and the best dose. Phase II trials test whether a new treatment has an e ffect on the disease. Phase III trials compare the results of people taking a new treatment with the results of people taking the st andard treatment. Phase IV trials are done using thousands of people after a treatment has been approved and marketed, to check for side e ffects that were not seen in the phase III trial. cohort study (KOH -hort STUH -dee) A research study that compares a particular outcome (such as lung cancer) in groups of individuals who are alike in many ways but di ffer by a certain characteristic (for example, female nurses who smoke compared with those who do not smoke). compassionate use trial (kum -PA-shuh -nut yoos TRY-ul) Also called Expanded access trial. A way to provide an investigational therapy to a patient who is not eligible to receive that therapy in a clinical trial, but who has a serious or life - threatening illness for which other treatments are not available. Compassionate use trials allow patients to receive promising but not yet fully studied or approved cancer therapies w hen no other treatment option exists. complementary and alternative medicine (KOM -pleh-MEN -tuh-ree... all- TER-nuh-tiv MEH -dih-sin) Also called CAM. Forms of treatment that are u sed in addition to (complementary) or instead of (alternative) standard treatments. These practices generally are not considered standard medical approaches.

During deferred therap y, patients may be given certain exams and tests. It is sometimes used in prostate cance r. Also called expectant management. definitive treatment (deh-FIH-nih-tiv TREE T-ment)7 The treatment plan for a disease or disorder that has been chosen as the best one for a patient after all other choices have been considered. Dox-SL Also called form of th e anticancer drug doxorubicin that is contained in very tin y, fat-like particles. It may have fewer side e ffects and work better than doxorubicin. Dox -SL is used to treat ovarian cance r, AIDS -related Kaposi sarcoma, and multiple myeloma in patients whose d isease has not gotten better after treatment with other anticancer drugs. It may be used together with other anticancer drugs. It is also being studied in the treatment of other types of cance r. Dox -SL is a type of anthracycline antitumor antibiotic. Doxil SEE eligibility criteria (EH-lih-jih-BIH-lih-tee kry-TEER -ee-uh) In clinical trials, requirements that must be met for an individual to be included in a stud y. These requirements help make sure that patients in a trial are similar to each other in terms of specific factors such as age, type and stage of cance r, general health, and previous treatment. When all participants meet the same eligibility criteria, it gives researchers greater confidence that results of the study are caused by the intervention being tested and not by other factors. enalapril (eh-NA-luh-pril) An antihypertensive agent that can also be used to slow or prevent the progression of heart disease in people with childhood cancer treated with drugs that may be harmful to t he heart. Evacet (EH-vuh-set) SEE Dox -SL, above.

A type of therapy in which radiation is aimed at a tumor from many different directions. The patient lays on a table and is moved through a donut -shaped machine. The radiation source in the machine rotates around the patient in a spiral pattern. Before radiation, a 3 -dimensional (3 - D) image of the tumor is taken. This helps doctors find the highest dose of radiati on that can be used to kill tumor cells while causing less damage to nearby tissue. Helical tomotherapy is a type of intensity -modulated radiation therapy (IM RT). hydroxydaunorubicin (hy-DROK -see-DAW-noh-ROO -bih-sin) AL-fuh ...)
