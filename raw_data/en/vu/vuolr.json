One of the easiest ways to accomplish this is by boosting the immune system. To understand how to support our immune health and ward off illnesses, let's take a look at the basics. What Is Immunity? Simply put, it's the body's ability to resist infection by a disease-causing agent such as a bacterium or virus. How Can Holistic Aromatherapy Help? Holistic aromatherapy helps by using essential oils to support the body, mind and spirit. Essential oils can help your immune system fight viruses, bacteria, fungi, parasites and other microbes. Many essential oils used in treating infections possess antimicrobial properties and work directly against invading microorganisms. There are also essential oils that stimulate the immune system which can boost the body's own defenses. So this winter, consider making essential oils part of your routine to help protect your immune system and overall health during cold and flu season. This room spray is a simple way to start using essential oils to bolster immunity. Immune-Boosting Room Spray Recipe - 14 drops eucalyptus (eucalyptusglobulus)\u2014antibacterial, antiviral - 10 drops orange (citrus sinensis)\u2014antiseptic - 6 drops tea tree (melaleucaalternifolia)\u2014antimicrobial, bactericide, antifungal Combine the essential oils with 4 ounces of distilled water and 1 teaspoon of rubbing alcohol.
