Goldman School of Dental Medicine, and the School of Public Health. Boston Medical Center Corporation and the Trustees of Boston University (collectively known as the \"Proponents\") are pleased to submit this Institutional Master Plan Amendment Notification Form / Project Notification Form to initiate the Boston Redevelopment Authority (\"BRA\") Article 80 Institutional Master Plan Review and Large Project Review Process for the BMC IMP project modifications. With this submission, the Proponents request that the BRA issue two separate Scoping Determinations: one for this Amendment to the Institutional Master Plan and one for the Large Project Review. The purpose of this IMP Amendment is to obtai n approval for modifications to projects previously approved in the 2010 Institutional Master Plan (\"IMP\") and the addition of approximately 17,136 square feet for Boston Medical Center. These modifications will allow for critical campus alignment and growth, the reduction of ambulance traffic and materials deliveries along Albany Street, and the replacement of the existing yellow utility tube spanning Albany Street with a simple bridge to handle patient transfer and materials handling. On June 22, 2010, the BRA approved the Boston University Medical Center Institutional Master Plan Renewal. As outlined in the approved 2010 IMP, BMC recognizes an immediate need to address space and physical constraints of its existing campus and respond to clinical trends through new construction, demolition and renovation. BMC seeks to amend the approved 2010 Institutional Master Plan to incorporate minor modifications consisting of: An addition to the existing Moakley Cancer Center (to facilitate the relocation and expansion of outpatient services); Minor footprint, massing, and phasing revisions to the 2010 IMP New Inpatient Building (to include the expansion of the Emergency Department and Trauma Center); Relocation of the 2010 IMP Energy Facility; Replacement of the existing yellow utility tube across Albany Street with a new Bridge (to service patient transport and materials handling); and Inclusion of the acquisition of the Perkin Elmer site. The proposed IMP project modifications are consistent with BMC's previously stated planning assumptions in the approved 2010 IMP. These modifications are necessary to consolidate and right-size clinical services to support new trends in health care delivery and patient volume, upgrade and expand the Emergency Department and Trauma Center, and move the core of the clinical campus to the west. The benefits of these modifications include: Elevated quality of care as a result of new and upgraded facilities and technology; Increased organizational efficiencies due to centralized services and improved operational adjacencies; 1.0 IMP Amendment 1-2 Improved energy infrastructure that increases energy efficiency and reliability, reduces environmental impact, and lowers operating costs; Refined pedestrian experience along Albany Street through site improvements, reduction of curb cuts, and the replacement of the yellow utility tube with a new bridge; and Improved delivery of patient care and reduced operational costs through significantly decreasing patient transfers by ambulance and construction of a new patient transport bridge. Figures 1-1 and 1-2 illustrate the general locati on of the Boston University Medical Center Campus (\"BUMC Campus\"). Figure 1-3 illustrates the Boston University Medical Center Campus (\"BUMC Campus\") approved 2010 IMP. 1.2 Summary of Proposed IMP Modifications 1.2.1 Moakley Cancer Center Addition The Moakley Cancer Center Addition is the enabling project for all proposed IMP projects. This project will house departments displaced from the expanded Emergency Department and Trauma Center, and the Centralized Surgical Department, and will accommodate increased volume in outpatient care. The addition will contain approximately 27,800 square feet. 1.2.2 New Inpatient Building The New Inpatient Building, as discussed in the 2010 IMP, will address the need to meet current clinical care standards, improve the pat ient care environment by modernizing critical care areas, and allow for the consolidation of multiple departments, including the Emergency Department and Trauma Center, Ma in Radiology Department, Surgical Department and Interventional Procedures, and additional Intensive Care Unit beds, and provide vital connections to adjacent campus buildings and the helipad. BMC is currently proposing to move forward with Phase 1 of the project. The New Inpatient Building Phase 1 will contain approximately 78,800 square feet. Phase 1 will necessitate demolition of a portion of the Dowling Building. The second phase of the New Inpatient Building containing approximately 323,000 square feet is proposed on the site of the Dowling Tower, directly adjacent to the Phase 1 of the New Inpatient Building. This will necessitate the demolition of the Dowling Tower (the remaining portion of the Dowling Building located at the corner of Massachusetts Avenue and Albany Street). Phase 2 of the New Inpatient Building will provide appropriately sized modern inpatient spaces that meet modern clinical standards and expansion space to accommodate future critical care and imaging functions. Together with Phase 1 and the Shapiro Ambulatory 1.0 IMP Amendment 1-3 Care Center, this new building will enhance medical functions to meet programmatic needs and reinforce the Albany Street campus image. 1.2.3 Boston Medical Center Energy Facility A 48,000 square foot state-of-the-art combined heat and power facility was approved by the BRA on June 22, 2010. The new Energy Facility was proposed to be located to the east of the existing Power Plant. Since that time, BMC has reevaluated the location and other project data of the approved Energy Facility and now proposes to relocate it to the west side of the existing Power Plant to take advantage of existing utility connections. The Energy Facility is proposed to be slightly smaller at approximately 38,500 square feet. 1.2.4 New Patient Transport Bridge BMC proposes to replace the existing yellow utility tube spanning Albany Street with a new Bridge to provide patient transport from the existing helipad to the emergency room and accommodate the transfer of clean materials. Patient transfer by ambulance between the helipad and the Emergency Department will be e liminated, thereby diminishing vehicular traffic along Albany Street. This, in turn, enables more efficient and direct patient transport to the Emergency Department thusly improving the delivery of patient care. Currently, Med Flight patients arrive by helicopter at the south side of the existing Power Plant. Patients are transferred from the helipad via ambulance to the Emergency Department in the Menino Pavilion located on the north side of Albany Street. BMC explored other options to improve patient transport while also decreasing ambulance traffic on Albany Street. Options explored involved the re-use of existing below grade tunnels. Two existing tunnels are located beneath Albany Street. The first tunnel located between the existing Power Plant and the Shapiro Ambulatory Care Center is used solely as a utility tunnel and houses the high pressure steam lines serving the north side of Albany Street. The tunnel is too narrow to support the transfer of patients (and materials) and further, transferring patients alongside utilit ies presents unsafe conditions. The second tunnel located at the basement of the Menino Pavilion below the Emergency Department entrance is constrained by low ceiling heights and has a steep slope which makes for hazardous conditions in transferring patients. Additionally, the tunnel is circuitous from the helipad necessitating additional time to travel to the Emergency Department. Finally, the tunnel would require traveling through non-patient transport corridors flanked by the Morgue and the Central Processing Department, and support departments. 1.2.5 Centralized Loading and Materials Handling The current loading dock for the West Campus will be relocated away from hospital entrances to an interim central location within the existing Power Plant in order to separate service areas from patient care areas. This will provide for a reduction in curb cuts along Albany Street and contribute to an improved pedestrian experience, one of the Proponents' long term planning objectives. Due to the relocation of the loading dock, a new below grade tunnel is proposed beneath Albany Street to transport soiled materials from the Menino Pavilion to the Power Plant. This new tunnel will replace the current function provided at the 1.0 IMP Amendment 1-4 existing loading dock that will be relocated to the interim location at the existing Power Plant. The new Bridge and proposed new tunnel will allow BMC to separate the transport of clean materials and soiled materials in order to meet regulatory requirements for avoiding cross-contamination of materials handling. The new tunnel will be used for transporting soiled materials, including medical waste and trash, while clean materials will be transported through the new Bridge providing for improv ed safety in material handling operations. When the Administration / Clinical Building is ready to move forward, the final loading dock location would move to the rear of this new building. Additionally, BMC will further explore the final configuration and alternatives to the site access and drop-off for this proposed building. 1.2.6 Albany Fellows On January 12, 2010 the BRA approved an IMP Amendment to incorporate the Albany Fellows site which is approximately 1.7 acres consisting of 3 parcels: Parcel 1 contains approximately 15,324 square feet; Parcel 2A contains approximately 38,920 square feet, and Parcel 2B contains approximately 20,766 s quare feet. The total development includes 442,800 square feet of gross floor area. Boston University completed the nine story 84,033 square foot building providing 104 housing units for 208 graduate students of the Boston University Medical Campus with approximately 12,000 square feet of land scaped open space and approximately 5,000 square feet of ground floor retail space, now occupied by a child-care (daycare) provider. The building opened in June 2012. The future development of Parcels 1 and 2B (including the remainder of Parcel 2A not used for the open space or the graduate student housing) will be limited to approximately 358,500 square feet of above grade building space and up to 322 parking spaces. Potential uses for the future facilities may include: housing (either student housing or housing for faculty and staff of Boston University or Boston Medical C enter), ground level retail, office, backstreets, research & development, and academic space. For purposes of ensuring that the remaining parcels of the approved Albany Fellow Site continue to be included in the IMP the projects have been included in the IMP Amendment but do not require zoning approval under this amendment. 1.2.7 Clarification of Ownership In addition to the IMP project modifications, the Proponents request to incorporate the acquisition of the Perkin Elmer site located at 100 East Canton Street, 123 East Dedham Street, and 575 Albany Street for a total of 129,461 square feet. 1.0 IMP Amendment 1-5 1.2.8 Update in Use Newton Pavilion The Newton Pavilion is classified as \"Inpatient\" in the 2010 IMP. With the consolidation of clinical services to the West Campus, the potential future use of the Newton Pavilion may also include Administration/Research/Instruction. 1.2.9 Removal of Leased Space Since the filing of the 2010 IMP, the Proponents are no longer leasing space that has been approved for institutional use. BMC wishes to remove the following buildings from the Boston University Medical Center IMP as institutional use: Removal of the Northampton Street lease of 10,000 square feet. BU Medical Campus wishes to remove the following buildings from the Boston University Medical Center IMP as institutional use: Removal of 761 Harrison Avenue, Harrison Court Apartments/Offices lease (effective September 30, 2013) of 122,922 square feet.

Ultimately these projects will enhance BMC's mi ssion \"to consistently provide excellent and accessible health services to all in need of care, regardless of status or ability to pay.\" The improvements are consistent with BMC's guiding principles and planning assumptions outlined in the 2010 IMP: Accommodate changes in patient volume; 1.0 IMP Amendment 1-6 Consolidate clinical services; Upgrade and expand the Emergency Department and Trauma Center; and Move the core of the clinical campus to the west. At this time BMC is initiating Large Project Review for the following projects: Moakley Cancer Center Addition New Inpatient Building Phase 1 Energy Facility New Patient Transport Bridge The projects are interdependent and together will help BMC achieve multiple master planning goals (outlined in the approved 2010 IMP) within the next five years. The sequence of the proposed projects begins with the construction of the Moakley Cancer Center Addition. Once this project is complete, departments to be displaced by the planned expansion and consolidation of multiple departments, which include the Emergency Department and Trauma Center, Main Radiol ogy Department, Surgical Department and Interventional Procedures, and Intensive Care Unit, will be moved to this facility enabling the construction of the New Inpatient Building Phase 1. The new Energy Facility will be constructed and the existing yellow utility tube can be replaced with the new Bridge. Materials handling will move to an interim location in the existing Power Plant. Once this five year plan is complete, BMC may then construct Phase 2 of the New Inpatient Building and the new Administration / Clinical Building. See Section 2 for more information on the Large Project Review Projects. This IMP Amendment and Large Project Review will allow BMC to begin the construction of campus upgrades necessary to addre ss immediate needs for improved and expanded facilities. These upgrades are necessitated by changes in health care service delivery and volume trends. Due to the interdependent nature of the proposed improvements, BMC is initiating one Large Project Review. 1.0 IMP Amendment 1-7 Figure 1-1 Boston University Medical Center Locus Plan 1.0 IMP Amendment 1-8 Figure 1-2 BUMC Campus Plan 1.0 IMP Amendment 1-9 Figure 1-3 BUMC Campus Approved 2010 IMP Projects 1.0 IMP Amendment 1-10 Figure 1-4 BUMC Campus Proposed 2013 IMP Amendment Projects 1.0 IMP Amendment 1-11 1.3 Project Identification Project Name: Boston University Medical Center IMPNF Amendment/PNF Address / Location: The BUMC Campus is located in Boston's South End.

Williams, Associate General Counsel 1.4 Boston Medical Center Mission and Objectives Boston University Medical Center is dedicat ed to serving the needs of the community. Comprised of BMC and BU Medical Campus, the synergy among these institutions and the incorporation of teaching and research with the clinical programs is essential to improving health for the general public. 1.4.1 Boston Medical Center BMC was incorporated as a Massachusetts charitable corporation July 1, 1996 with the merger of Boston City Hospital, Boston Specialty and Rehabilitation Hospital, and the Boston University Medical Center Hospital, referred to as University Hospital. BMC is a private, not- for-profit, 496-licensed bed, academic medical center located in Boston's historic South End. The hospital is the primary teaching affiliate for Boston University School of Medicine. Boston Medical Center emphasizes community based care, with its mission to provide consistently accessible health services to all. The largest safety net hospital in New England, Boston Medical Center provides a full spectrum of pe diatric and adult care services, from primary 1.0 IMP Amendment 1-13 care and family medicine to advanced specialty ca re. BMC is the largest and busiest provider of trauma and emergency services in New England. The Emergency Department had 129,714 visits in 2012. With more than 26,132 discharges and 1,025,202 total outpatient visits in 2012, BMC provides a comprehensive range of inpatient, clinical and diagnostic services in more than 70 areas of medical specialties and subspecialties, including cardiac care and surgery, hypertension, neurological care, orthopedics, geriatrics, and women's health. Unwavering in its commitment to serve the community, BMC is dedicated to providing accessible health care. Approximately 73% of BMC patients come from underserved populations, the low-income and the elderly, and 30% do not speak English as a primary language. With its strong focus on urban health, in 1995 BMC was a founding partner in Boston HealthNet, an integrated service delivery network that includes BMC, Boston University School of Medicine, and 14 community health centers throughout the greater Boston area. In FY 2012, Boston HealthNet patients comprised 32% of all inpatient admissions to BMC. Boston Medical Center HealthNet Plan, Inc. (BMCHP) is a not-for-profit health maintenance organization founded by Boston Medical Center in 1997. BMCHP's Massachusetts business, BMC HealthNet Plan, serves nearly 260,000 members across the state through three product lines: MassHealth (Medicaid), Commonwealth Care and a commercial product for small businesses and individuals. It is the largest MassHealth health plan in Massachusetts. BMC HealthNet Plan was recognized for its ongoing commitment to quality when it was named one of the top ten Medicaid health plans in the country according to the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) Medicaid Health Insurance Plan Rankings 2012-2013. In addition, it has maintained Excellent Accreditation from NCQA for its Massachusetts Medicaid plan since its initial accreditation in 2009. BMC is a recognized leader in groundbreaking medical research. BMC received more than $132 million in sponsored research funding in 2012, and oversees 540 research and service projects separate from research activities at Boston University School of Medicine. BMC is a major employer in the City of Boston and is committed to promoting employment opportunities for Boston residents. See Section 1.9.1.2 - Employment, Workforce Development, and Educational Opportunities for more information. The mission of BMC is \"to consistently provide excellent and accessible health services to all in need of care, regardless of status or ability to pay.\" The objective of BMC is to meet the health needs of the people of Boston and its surrounding communities by providing high quality, comprehensive care to all, particularly mindful of the needs of the vulnerable populations through an integrated delivery system in an ethically and financially responsible manner. The goals of the integrated system of care are to promote health and well-being, meet the medical and public health needs of all served, and educate future physicians and caregivers. 1.0 IMP Amendment 1-14 In compliance with the mission statement above and in an effort to create a community-based system of services in collaboration with Boston HealthNet BMC has committed itself to seven equally important values. BMC will: Serve patients and their families, physicians, staff and communities with dignity; Integrate public health, preventative, emer gency and rehabilitative programs with a full range of primary to tertiary medical service; Serve the ever-changing need of urban and suburban populations, while honoring their ethnic, religious and cultural differences; Apply a high degree of medical, nursing and technical management in a professional and accountable manner; Collaborate with Boston University, its schools and other institutions to support a premier learning environment for all members of the community; Conduct research that will lead to major improvements in health care and health status for all people, and further scientific advances in medicine; and Develop and participate in community-based and managed care programs that promote affordable, responsible and high-quality health care. 1.4.2 Boston University Medical Campus BU Medical Campus has a rich history dating back to 1848 when its School of Medicine began as the New England Female Medical College, the first institution in the world to offer medical education to women and graduated the first black woman physician. In 1873, the medical college merged with Boston Universi ty, becoming the first coeducational medical school in the nation. In addition to the School of Medicine (\"BUSM\", with its Division of Graduate Medical Sciences), the BU Medical Campus is also comprised of the Goldman School of Dental Medicine (\"SDM\") and the School of Public Health (\"SPH\"). Renowned for the quality of teaching and research and for service to the community, these schools provide education and training in the most current thinking and techniques in their fields, with a particular focus on serving the disadvantaged, underserved and indigent populations. Together the schools employ a total of 3,100 faculty members (including full-time, part-time and adjunct), many who are leading experts in their fields, and train a diverse group of approximately 3,500 students. 1.4.3 Boston University School of Medicine The mission of the Boston University School of Medicine is to educate physicians who will have the knowledge, skills, and dedication needed to provide the best care to every patient from all communities in a diverse society, within an ever-changing health care environment. Other specific objectives are: The Vision - Patients, peers, and mentors will recognize the BUSM graduate as an exemplary clinician who maintains the highest standards of medical care and professional conduct and who is fully prepared for postgraduate training; 1.0 IMP Amendment 1-15 Clinical Arts - The graduate will: possess excellent diagnostic skills, a broad foundation of medical knowledge, and the clinical experience needed to deliver effective and efficient medical care; demonstrate excellence in communicating with and educating patients from diverse cultures, races, and ethnicities; work effectively and collaboratively within interdisciplinary teams; use information technology effectively to find and evaluate the best clinical evidence to guide patient care; be dedicated to preventing illness and improving the health of the community in which he or she practices while responsive to the family, psychosocial, cultural, and spiritual/religious determinants of health and illness; and Professionalism - The graduate will treat all patients in a caring, compassionate, and altruistic manner; adhere to the highest ethical standards of medical practice; possess the attitudes, abilities, and self-knowledge necessary for leading a life-long pattern of learning; support improvements in access to health care for all populations, a reduction in racial and ethnic disparities in health status, and improvements in the social conditions of disadvantaged populations; and contribute to the advancement of scientific knowledge. BUSM promotes these qualities via: establishment of a supportive, respectful, and nurturing educational environment; maintenance of the highest standards of student performance; commitment to achieving and supporting a diverse student body; engagement of students in curricular evaluation; maintenance of a curriculum inclusive of evidence-based educational methods and through leadership in developing, applying, and evaluating innovative methods of medical education. To achieve a dynamic curriculum responsive to rapid social and biomedical changes, and to insure that student and curricular goals are met and the highest educational standards of excellence are maintained, BUSM continuously ev aluates its learners, faculty, programs, and its mission and goals. 1.4.4 Goldman School of Dental Medicine The mission of the Henry M. Goldman School of Dental Medicine is to provide excellent education to dental medicine professionals throughout their careers; to shape the future of dental medicine and dental education through research; to offer excellent health care services to the community; to participate in community activities; and to foster a respectful and supportive environment.

In keeping with the SPH's service-oriented philosophy, each department combines research and academics with a practicum requirement, resulting in a rigorous, well-rounded curriculum enhanced by work experience in the public health environment. Strategic themes of the SPH include: Involved: Emphasize real-world in volvement and meaningful partnerships Interconnected: Emphasize interdisciplinary efforts and integrated programs Global: Emphasize global health issues and perspectives. Through longstanding collaborations with such institutions as the Massachusetts Department of Public Health, the Boston Public Health Commission, and the Veterans Affairs Administration; and international alliances with the Red Cross, the Peace Corps, and foreign governments, the students, faculty, and alumni draw on their own diverse backgrounds to carry out the SPH's mission in a variety of settings. 1.5 Existing Campus and Facilities The BUMC Campus is located in Boston's historic South End. The main campus includes 33 Boston University Medical Center owned or controlled buildings, a helipad and development parcels that are individually-owned or controlled and shared facilities associated with each or both of the institutions. In addition to the property owned or controlled by the Proponents, each institution also leases office, instructional, and/or clinical space in 8 buildings located on and/or proximate to the campus. Total Boston University Medical Center owned or controlled and leased space is approximately 3,316,500 square feet of usable space. Buildings range from 2 to 14 stories in height above ground. The buildings were built between 1864 (BCD/FGH), 2011 (Carl J. and Ruth Shapiro Ambulatory Care Center), and 2012 (Albany Fellows Phase 1 BU Medical Campus Graduate Student Housing). The Dr. Solomon Carter Fuller Mental Health Center, a state mental health facility, is also located on the BUMC Campus. There are currently 2,940 structured parking spaces in garages and 482 surface parking spaces (3,422 total on-campus and offsite parking spaces).

BMC endeavors to sustain the highest expected standard of patient care while BU Medical Campus strives to maintain an exceptional environment for students interested in basic science, clinical investigation, or public health and health services oriented research, and medical educational programs. Aging buildings, deficient infrastructure components, and inefficient operational adjacencies create challenges for each institution to keep up with current advancements in health care and academic trends. As a result, campus modifications will be neces sary over the next 10 years, including but not limited to, constructing new facilities, demo lishing obsolete buildings, renovating existing structures, and improving infrastructure. 1.6.1 Shared Planning Assumptions and Objectives The following challenges play a role in addressing the Proponents' program needs: Building age (and obsolescence); Traffic demands; Parking needs; Open space preservation; and Utilities, power plant, and other energy infrastructure upgrades. The Proponents acknowledge the following planning design drivers as elements critical to the successful realization of their objectives: Planning for long-term future growth and transformation; Transformation of the Albany Street campus image; Sensitivity to context through massing, scale and materials; Creation of a clear and welcoming sense of arrival; Implementation of unified site signage and enhanced wayfinding; Development of pedestrian-friendly street edges; and Enhance accessibility to parking and existing buildings. 1.6.2 BMC Planning Assumptions and Objectives Like all academic medical centers and health system providers, BMC is responding to dramatic changes in health care delivery. BMC recently completed an in-depth strategic plan that articulated a vision to transform the care delivery model to thrive in the new environment. There are many factors that will contribute to the successful implementation of the model but chief among them is aligning resources in the most efficient and effective manner to deliver quality care. While relocation of all clinical services to the west end of the BUMC Campus is the ultimate goal, consolidation of all inpati ent services, emergency/trauma care, radiology, and interventional procedures (surgery and other invasive procedures) on one site is critical to the delivery of care model. BMC has also c ontinued to experience changing trends in patient 1.0 IMP Amendment 1-21 volume. This necessitates the need to upgrade its facilities to right-size patient care spaces and to meet modern day clinical care standards. Table 1-3 Inpatient Admissions and Outpatient Visits at BMC 2008 address these clinical trends and achieve the primary goal of providing quality health care to the neediest individuals, BMC objectives include: Accommodate changing trends in patient volume; Consolidate clinical services; Upgrade and expand the Emergency Department and Trauma Center; Right size space for current clinical standards; Accommodate new technology; Upgrade materials handling/receiving/distribution and waste removal facilities; Implement an efficient and sustainable ener gy infrastructure program to ensure reliability and redundancy of services and support future growth; Integrate sustainable design principles and operations; Facilitate access to the cam pus and improve campus image; Consolidate Medical Administrative functi ons in proximity to clinical services; Locate General Administrative functions on the campus perimeter; and Move the core of the clinical campus to the west. 1.6.3 BU Medical Campus Planning Assumptions and Objectives The BU Medical Campus outlines three areas of concern regarding their current instructional facilities: 1. Quantity - BU Medical Campus currently struggles to meet space needs within their existing buildings as academic programs in medical and research studies and enrollment grow. In addition to the current demand limitations, the American Association of Medical Colleges is calling on medical schools to increase their class size by 30% over the next decade. Additionally, the current method of scheduling instructional space places limitations on the utilization of space and affects the overall quantity and type of space required. 2. Quality - Certain types of academic spaces need to be planned specifically to meet the requirements of the curriculum. These spaces can be more traditional classroom settings or creative solutions driven by instructional technology and strategy. Rooms retrofitted into existing structures ar e often limited by size, layout, technical infrastructure, and available resources and subsequently do not adequately meet the 1.0 IMP Amendment 1-22 needs of the university. Of particular importance is the need to enable increasing levels of student interaction in all instructional spaces. 3. Proximity - It is imperative that new in structional spaces designed to meet growth needs are located in an area considered core to current instructional facilities. Developing instructional space in BU Medical Campus-owned or rented buildings that are not proximate to the current core has a detrimental effect on the operational and didactic aspects of the academic effort. Moving students around for breakout classes for large lectures (as is required for the medical school curriculum) or between classes (as is typical for other curricula) contributes to a loss of instructional time. The issue of proximity also creates issues for ancillary services in supporting rooms for the delivery of instruction. Offering and maintaining support services over a wider geographic area deteriorates the quality of that service. Distance creates limitations in availability of the staff to clean, set up and maintain rooms, provide initial and ongoing audiovisual support, respond to technology/systems troubleshooting requests or other needs and services sought by the instructor in support of their class. These areas of concern are also relevant for current research facilities needed to support the long term needs of the medical and educational institutions. In order to support the primary goal of educating future health care professionals, BU Medical Campus objectives include: Planning for long-term future growth and transformation; Provide student housing consistent with City's desire to reduce demand on off- campus rental housing stock; Expand academic programs; Foster opportunities for Interprofessional Education; Upgrade student services, including increased student gathering, group study and student wellness facilities; Consolidate and upgrade research facilities; Increase inter-disciplinary opportunities and synergies between research programs; and Consolidate administrative support functions. 1.6.4 Campus Adjacencies The existing BUMC Campus uses are generally zoned with educational functions centrally located, flanked by clinical uses to the east and west. This relationship is primarily a function of the remnants of the pre-merger of the original two campuses. Other major zones include a Support Zone (Power Plant and Parking) and Research (BioSquare) south of Albany Street, and Administration (Crosstown) west of Massachusetts Avenue. See Figure 1-6. Campus design goals and objectives are specifically associated with enhancing institutional functions, primarily through the establishment of ideal adjacencies between complementary uses. This is particularly important for a ca mpus that delivers medical services, where efficiency is not simply desirable, but may be crit ical to delivery of patient care in a timely 1.0 IMP Amendment 1-23 manner. At the same time, it is also advantageous to create synergies between the delivery of medical services and academic instruction in health sciences. Boston University Medical Center's master planning objectives of shifting administrative functions away from the inner clinical core location is ideal for inpatient clinical expansion to be situated proximate to other key clinical pr ograms as well as situating academic spaces proximate to the instructional core. The proposed modifications and IMP projects support and enhance these concepts. The Moakley Cancer Center Addition, New Inpatient Building, Energy Facility, patient transport Bridge, and new Administrative / Clinical Building together will shift the clinical campus core to the west, consolidate clinical services, accommodate changing trends in patient volume, enable more efficient and cost-effective transfer of patients and materials, and upgrade and expand the Emergency Department and Trauma Center. 1.0 IMP Amendment 1-24 Figure 1-6 Campus Adjacencies 1.0 IMP Amendment 1-25 1.7 Summary of Program Needs Since the filing and approval of the 2010 IMP, there have been recent changes in health care delivery trends as well as advances in patient care, technology, and health sciences which necessitate specific revisions to program needs. The proposed modifications to the IMP still align with the previous guiding principles and planning assumptions of the Proponents. 1.7.1 Clinical Services Consolidation of all inpatient, emergency /trauma care, radiology and interventional procedures to the west side of the campus necessitate that new space be obtained. Due to very specific requirements for hospital and clinical functions driven by today's code and clinical space standards, it is impractical to rehabilitate certain buildings. BMC strives to consolidate its clinical programs in proximity to core medical services and operational support functions. This is a particularly important consider ation in locating medical facilities to allow for time and continuity of care as well as efficiency for staff and convenience for visitors. The proposed Moakley Cancer Center Addition, New Inpatient Building, and Administration / Clinical Building directly address these needs. 1.7.2 Administrative A major objective of Boston University Medical Center is to consolidate campus functions while shifting administrative uses away from the clinical and instructional cores. Administrative uses are scattered through the campus creating inefficiencies and occupying space that is ideal for clinical expansion and academic programming. The future Administration / Clinical Building will help c onsolidate these functions and improve campus adjacencies. 1.7.3 Support Operations and Infrastructure Boston University Medical Center includes m any older structures and has expanded over the years. As BMC's clinical programs have ex panded, the infrastructure that supports day-to- day operations for loading and receiving and materials handling and trash removal has remained unchanged. Servicing these buildings and projected future programming requires new and upgraded facilities to support BMC's operations. The proposed new Bridge and proposed new below grade tunnel connecting to the interim materials handling area (in the existing Power Plant) will support these goals by facilitating the transfer of patients and materials, centralizing truck traffic, and reducing vehicular congestion and curb cuts along Albany Street. 1.7.4 Energy Service The BUMC Campus relies on many utilities that are approaching operating capacity. In order to support the growth of the campus, keep up with advancements in technology, and deliver clinical services 24/7, Boston University Medical Center is faced with the challenge of managing the availability and reliability of energy se rvice which is critical to a major medical center. The goal is to reduce Boston Univer sity Medical Center's demand on existing taxed 1.0 IMP Amendment 1-26 infrastructure, create redundancy, and to install more energy-efficient equipment that will set the foundation for supporting greener campus growth. The new BMC Energy Facility will address infrastructure and energy service needs for the BUMC Campus as well as the adjacent BioSquare. Upon further review of the selected site and program described in the 2010 IMP, BMC now proposes a smaller Energy Facility and to move the location to the west side of the existing Power Plant to be closer to utility connections thusly increasing overall efficiencies. 1.8 Urban Design Objectives Section 1.7 provides details regarding the shared planning assumptions, the consolidation of campus functions, and the optimization of operati onal adjacencies. This section outlines the broader urban design goals that benefit neighbors and visitors, as well as students, patients, faculty, and staff, and describes how all users engage and experience the campus. The primary urban design objective of Boston University Medical Center is to create a cohesive medical campus thoughtfully int egrated into the surrounding urban fabric and neighborhoods. Since the merger of Boston City Hospital and University Hospital in 1996, sensitive design, careful open space planning, and conscientious site and streetscape enhancements along the campus periphery have supported this objective. Various improvement projects, implemented under the previous Institutional Master Plan, refined the presence and aesthetic of the BUMC Campus, specifically along Harrison Avenue and Albany Street. (See Figure 1-7 Campus Improvement Projects.) Additional master planning design goals to support future development on the BUMC Campus include: Transform the Albany Street campus image. Complement the existing context massing, scale, and materials. Create a clear and welcoming sense of arrival. Enhance open spaces on the campus, both short and long-term. Develop pedestrian friendly street edges. Enable connectivity between parking and existing buildings. Integrate sustainable design principles and operations. Plan proactively for future growth and transformation. These new master plan goals, combined with the previously applied design principles, will enrich the physical image of the BUMC Campus, improve the integration with the surrounding neighborhood, and elevate the perceptions of the Boston University Medical Center by its users, particularly on Albany Street. Ultimately, the institution strives for consistency, compatibility, and connectivity in the design and location of its buildings, open spaces, streetscapes, pedestrian access, and overall campus circulation. 1.0 IMP Amendment 1-27 Figure 1-7 Campus Plan Improvements 1.0 IMP Amendment 1-28 1.8.1 Consistency with the Harrison Albany Corridor Strategic Plan The Institutional Master Plan aligns with the vision and goals established in the Harrison Albany Corridor Strategic Plan (HASCP) and the IMP has been developed to enhance Boston University Medical Center's public service and economic development role in the community. Under earlier master plans, Boston University Medical Center has accomplished preserving and enhancing open space. The proposed projects under the current master plan will continue this. The design of the proposed buildings will blend with the historic and modern BUMC Campus as well as the adjacent neighborhood. The proposed buildings along Albany Street will be designed to align with the HACSP vision for pedestrian realm improvements including paving, lighting and way finding. Proposed building setbacks and architectural features such as glass facades at the ground level and canopies are intended amenities for the general public. The proposed buildings will be designed as an integral component of a streetscape that will form and enhance the character of the street. To that end, HACSP streetscape guide lines will be explored along with other criteria. Curb cuts on both sides of Albany Street will be reduced to reinforce the pedestrian circulation and improve the experience. Additionally, the existing loading dock and associated traffic will be relocated from the north side of Albany Street to an interim location at the existing Power Plant on the south side thereby diminishing the congestion and conflicting traffic patterns. The design of the New Inpatient Building at the intersection of Massachusetts Avenue and Albany Street will capitalize on the opportunity to improve the pedes trian experience at this pivotal intersection as so appropriately cited by the HACSP. 1.8.2 Existing Urban Fabric The BUMC Campus is bound by a residential neighborhood to the north along Harrison Avenue, support and research and development uses to the south along Albany Street, and light industrial and commercial uses to the east and west. The existing campus is also bordered by major roadways, most notably Massachusetts Avenue. This prominent artery forms an important gateway to the BUMC Campus and links the institution to the City of Boston. Significant pedestrian routes, such as the East Concord Street corridor, weave through the campus. The existing architectural context is comprised of a variety of scales, styles, and periods. Building heights range from two to 14 stories. Traditional historic buildings, such as the Talbot, BCD, and FGH Buildings, were constructed in the late 1800's. The recently completed Moakley Building and the Shapiro Ambulatory Care Center portray the current, modern campus aesthetic. These diverse build ings represent Boston University Medical Center's sensitivity to historic context through preservation and its commitment to delivering state-of-the-art health care. See Figure 1-2 BUMC Campus Plan for more information. 1.0 IMP Amendment 1-29 1.8.3 Public Realm 1.8.3.1 Campus Development, Past and Present: A Balanced Approach As clinical care trends have evolved over the years, so have the physical parameters necessary to support them. Buildings with larger footprints and uninterrupted floor plates are often required. These large-scale designs sometimes result in unfortunate impacts on the urban fabric, such as the elimination of roadways and open spaces. While addressing the ever-changing aspects of clinical care, the BUMC Campus utilizes a balanced master planning approach with minimal collateral loss to existing infrastructure through its commitment to historical precedents and open space strategies. Recent planning initiatives sensitively maintain the integrity of the urban fabric and the surrounding neighborhoods while continuing to define a sense of campus and meet the institution's primary mission of healing and education. As a result, many of the original streets of the historic urban fabric have been retained and enhanced to better integrate the campus with the neighborhood. The Moakley Building is a recent example of careful campus planning. This structure was strategically located and oriented to reinforce the significant pedestrian connection between the east and west campuses and the centrally positioned medical school. Moakley Green, located north of the Moakley Building, strengthens the urban axis of Worcester Square and provides a landscaped transition between the campus edge and the residential neighborhood. Moakley Green is accessible to the public and provides pedestrian access to the campus from the north. 1.8.3.2 Campus Access and Connectivity An individual's experience with the BUMC Campus begins with their approach. The arrival sequence must be clear and the architecture and open spaces should impart an immediate and welcoming sense of arrival and place. The arrival experience should also convey the image and identity of the institution as a leader in healthcare, education, and research. The BUMC Campus is well connected to regional and district roadways while several MBTA bus and rapid transit routes service the area. The intersections of Massachusetts and Harrison Avenues and Massachusetts Avenue and Albany Street form key entry points to Boston University Medical Center. About half of the visitors arriving at the BUMC Campus by car will go directly to the parking garage located on Albany Street. Currently the arrival experience along Albany Street consists of a ragged edge of buildings of varying styles, ages, and conditions. This is also the primary Trauma Center access route for both East and West campuses. As previously stated, transforming and refining the Albany Street edge is essential to the future development of the BUMC Campus. Once on the campus, users encounter a range of choices for navigating to their destinations. Wayfinding must be clarified through the careful design and manipulation of building massing and materials, tree planting, sidewalk impr ovements, and a unified signage system 1.0 IMP Amendment 1-30 Massachusetts Avenue, East Concord Street, East Newton Street, and East Brookline Street are the major north/south vehicular and pedestrian throughways that connect the campus to the neighborhood. East Concord Street is the most important north/south pedestrian connection due to its axial relationship with the public parking garage at 710 Albany Street and its central location to the east and west medical campuses and the medical school. Harrison Avenue and Albany Street are the major east/west vehicular and pedestrian throughways that connect the campus to Massachusetts Avenue (and I-93) and the neighborhood. Albany Street will provide connec tivity to the BU Albany Fellows Graduate Student Housing and link future developments and medical and bio-tech clusters to the east and west as envisioned in the Harrison/Albany Study. See Figure 1-8 Major Vehicular Access and Major Entry Points. The relocation of the Emergency Department entrance for pedestrians and passenger vehicles will change local circulation pattern s. Passenger vehicles headed for the Emergency Department are proposed to use the Shapiro Courty ard. At the new entrance, drivers will be met by a valet who will transfer their vehicle via East Concord Street and across Albany Street to a valet-only parking lot proposed to the east side adjacent to the existing Power Plant. The relocation of the passenger vehicle pick- up and drop-off along with relocation of the existing loading dock on the north side of Albany Street to an interim location in front of the existing Power Plant to the south side will enable closure of three curb cuts in front of the existing Emergency Department entrance. The resulting one-way circulation scheme will reduce traffic conflicts on the north side of Albany Street and will enlarge space available for ambulances. On the south side of Albany Street, the existing curb cut located between the existing Power Plant and Finland Building will be reduced to one lane. The existing curb cut in front of the Power Plant for truck access will be relocated to better align with existing loading docks. The curb cut consolidation in conjunction with proposed sidewalk improvements similar to those associated with the Shapiro Ambulatory Care Center will foster a more unified, continuous, and pedestrian friendly streetscape. With the construction of the new Bridge and Energy Facility, the shuttle bus access to the Woods-Mullen Shelter from the driveway betwe en the Power Plant and Finland Building will be eliminated. The shuttle buses will instead use the proposed new one-way entrance and exit driveways on Massachusetts Avenue with right-in/right-out only curb cuts. The proposed new shuttle bus drop-off will be more efficient than the existing condition and will reduce traffic on Albany Street. Currently, the shuttle bus arrive s at Woods-Mullen Shelter by traveling north on Massachusetts Avenue and turning east on Albany Street and then south on the driveway in between the existing Finland Building and Power Plant Building. See Figure 1-9 Proposed Access, Entry and Circulation Changes On the southern perimeter of the BUMC Campus, pedestrian pathways facilitate staff movement between the 610 Albany Street parking garage, BioSquare, and the main medical 1.0 IMP Amendment 1-31 center. The South Bay Harbor Trail also joins the network of BUMC connections where it intersects with Massachusetts Avenue. See Figure 1-10 Neighborhood Connectivity and Open Space Network. There are several pedestrian pass-through connections on the BUMC Campus. These include access corridors at the Menino Pavilion, Moakley Building, and Talbot Building. The public corridor through the Menino Pavilion links the walk-in Emergency Department entry with the Menino Lobby. There is a limited-access corridor for wheelchair/stretcher patients through the Moakley Building that unites the Moakley/SACC south entry court with the Moakley Lobby. All users (public and instituti onal) access Talbot Green from Albany Street through the Talbot Building's two underpasses. Se curity has played an increasing role at institutions in recent years, and the BUMC Campus is no exception. As such, some public access through buildings that would connect Harrison Avenue to Albany Street is limited. See Figure 1-11 Pedestrian Connectivity. Additionally, Boston University Medical Center has a very active bicycle program that further promotes movement and connectivity throughout the medical center. See Transportation Section 4.2.8 for more information. See also Figure 4-11 for BUMC Campus Bicycle Facilities. 1.8.3.3 Campus Open Space Open spaces play a pivotal role in clarifying way finding and enhancing the user's experience. They furnish visual cues for circulation and effective linkages between city streets and campus pathways. One of the unique characterist ics of Boston University Medical Center is the amount and quality of its open spaces, virtually unprecedented on urban hospital campuses. While examining equivalent medical institutions within the City of Boston, it is evident that the amount of green space on the BUMC Campus is comparable and in some cases much greater than what is being provided elsewhere. Over recent years the completion of Master Plan improvements have significantly expande d the green space throughout the campus further defining and enhancing the pedestrian experience The existing network of open spaces features various nodes where the campus and community come together. Examples include the Moakley Green and landscaped public street edges along the Talbot Building, BioSquare, and Harrison Avenue. The open spaces also provide gathering areas for students, faculty, and staff. In particular, the lawn between the Talbot Building and the BU School of Medicine enables multi-purpose programming for campus events and accommodates pedestrians, bicycles, and vehicles. With the completion of the Moakley Building and renovations to the BCD and FGH buildings in 2006 and 2007, an enhanced arrival sequence and landscaped open spaces improved the north edge of the West Campus. These modifications benefit both the campus and surrounding neighborhoods through better design, welcoming aesthetics, and greater 1.0 IMP Amendment 1-32 connectivity. The location of the new Moakley Building, with its three-story atrium facing the green to the north, also reinforces an existing east/west pedestrian link. This further unifies the campus both physically and symbolically . (See Figure 1-10 Neighborhood Connectivity and Open Space Network). As per the institutional design goals and objectives, the Boston University Medical Center will continue to complement and animate its open space network through additional streetscape refinements and landscaped areas along the Albany Street corridor. 1.8.3.4 Campus Way finding and Signage Plan Boston University Medical Center developed a comprehensive signage and way finding plan several years ago. The goals of the BUMC Campus signage plan were to strengthen existing signing programs beyond the site in coordination with Federal, State and City authorities, to implement a program of gateway, directional, and street name signing, and coordinate and strengthen private signing to clarify the identity of each member institution. Boston University Medical Center signage efforts were coordinated with its neighbors including representatives of Crosstown, Newmarket Business Association, and the BRA. The architectural variation and intensive vehicular traffic in the general area of the BUMC Campus can present navigational difficulties for a visitor who is unfamiliar with the medical center. To address this issue, Boston Univer sity Medical Center implemented a program focused on four primary elements: off-site signi ng, on-site signing, area identification, and inner and outer loop campus signing. The program includes: Installation of trailblazer signage, in coordination with regulatory authorities, which displays the \"H\" hospital symbol reinforced by the BUMC Campus logos; Installation of a Gateway Pylon which serves as a directional sign, as well as a landmark, to indicate the point of entry into the BUMC Campus at the intersection of Massachusetts Avenue and Harrison Avenue; Installation of channel letters on the main hospital pavilions for area identification; and Installation of directional signage for the inner campus loop that links all the individual medical institutions within the inner campus, and outer loop signage that identifies BMC, BU Medical Campus, and BioSquare. Building identifiers were also placed near entrances to each campus building. BMC buildings are distinguished with blue and silver leaf signage and BU Medical Campus buildings are distinguished with red and gold leaf signage. Parking area identification is standardized since BMC, BU Medical Campus, and BioSquare share the same parking facilities. A \"P\" parking symbol consistent with the City of Boston standard is located at the entrance of each parking facility. In addition, the name of the instituti on served by the parking facility is listed below the parking symbol. For pedestrians, map retainer displays are located at key points on the BUMC Campus. The maps identify each institution and display information regarding 1.0 IMP Amendment 1-33 roadways, transportation routes, landmarks, pub lic transportation, parking, and other public amenities. The most recent expansion of the signage program was the inclusion of BioSquare Drive. The signage plan allows for future implementation and independent facility updates for each member institution. The proposed IMP projects and all previously appr oved projects will be consistent with the BUMC Campus signage plan. See Figure 1-12 BUMC Campus Signage Plan. 1.0 IMP Amendment 1-34 Figure 1-8 Major Vehicular Access and Major Entry Points 1.0 IMP Amendment 1-35 Figure 1-9 Proposed Access, Entry and Circulation Changes 1.0 IMP Amendment 1-36 Figure 1-10 Neighborhood Connectivity and Open Space Network 1.0 IMP Amendment 1-37 Figure 1-11 Pedestrian Connectivity 1.0 IMP Amendment 1-38 Figure 1-12 BUMC Campus Signage Plan 1.0 IMP Amendment 1-39 1.8.4 Massing and Height Several key factors drive the proposed massing, height, and location of the three master plan projects. The key factors include programmatic needs, optimization of existing real estate, architectural context, and previously established urban planning principles. These elements balance the needs of the institutions while continuing to strengthen and enhance the relationship between the BUMC Campus and the neighborhood. Each project will respond appropriately, both indi vidually and collectively, to the established institutional scale and aesthetic. They will also sensitively acknowledge the character of the South End with appropriate materials, massing, and scale. All of the proposed facilities will enrich the overall campus experience as well as enhance the Albany Street Urban Corridor. See Figures 1-13 to 1-17 Aerial Massing Views. 1.0 IMP Amendment 1-40 Figure 1-13 Proposed IMP Projects Aerial Looking North 1.0 IMP Amendment 1-41 Figure 1-14 Proposed IMP Projects Aerial Looking Northwest 1.0 IMP Amendment 1-42 Figure 1-15 Proposed IMP Projects Aerial Looking Southeast 1.0 IMP Amendment 1-43 Figure 1-16 Proposed IMP Projects Aerial Looking West 1.0 IMP Amendment 1-44 Figure 1-17 Proposed IMP Projects Aerial Looking West Massachusetts Ave Connector 1.0 IMP Amendment 1-45 1.9 Public Benefits Boston University Medical Center provides num erous public benefits to the City of Boston. The IMP projects will directly enhance the Proponents' abilities to administer the services that support their missions within the community. 1.9.1 Boston Medical Center 1.9.1.1 Community Benefits Introduction As previously noted, BMC's mission is to \"cons istently provide excellent and accessible health services to all in need of care, regardless of status or ability to pay.\" Approximately 70 percent of BMC's patients come from underserved populations, including low-income families, elders, people with disabilities, and immigrants. Seventy percent of all patients are from racial and ethnic minority populations, and 30 percent do not speak English as a primary language. To address the health needs of its diverse patient population, BMC provides a wide range of services beyond the traditional medical model . These programs, including but are not limited to patient navigation, interpreter services, and a food pantry, help reduce barriers to accessing health services and eliminate disparities in health care among the various populations BMC serves. BMC values its diverse patient population and is committed to honoring their ethnic, religious and cultural differences. The Interpreter Services program at BMC is the most extensive in New England and one of the largest in the country. In addition to providing person-to-person interpreters on-site in more than 21 languages, 24 hours a day, the program uses the latest advances in technology, such as telephonic and video interpreting. BMC interpreters help break language barriers as well as serve as cultural brokers to patients and staff. In 2012, BMC handled approximately 205,839 requests for interpreter services. BMC is committed to addressing health disparities, an issue for the Boston health care community that has been brought to the fore by several reports and government commissions in recent years. This commitment is reflected in investment in new facilities, technology and equipment to ensure that patients have access to state-of-the-art care; in cultural competency training for clinical and non-clinical staff and managers; and in specific projects reaching into the community or addressing disparities within disease areas. In addition to health care services, BMC provides a wide range of social services to meet the basic needs of the many vulnerable people it serves. Leveling the health care playing field for patients goes beyond commitment to providing exceptional health care without exception: BMC realizes that it must work in a multidisciplinary fashion and at multiple levels of patients' needs to help secure its patients' health. BM C services have evolve d over many years, including at its predecessor institutions, to provide benefits and services in line with its public health mission. Many programs that started at BMC - like the Reach Out and Read program and the Medical Legal Partnership I Boston - are now nationally replicated models to improve the health and development of vulnerable populations. 1.0 IMP Amendment 1-46 BMC's Community Benefits program is not formalized in a specific annual Community Benefits Plan. The BMC Board of Trustees, BMC senior management, the Boston HealthNet Board of Directors, and individual department leaders annually prioritize programs and services for the vulnerable populations they serve. BMC categorizes Community Benefits programs by the themes of ensuring access to health care for underserved populations and securing the fundamentals of health in key areas of public health concern. These programs receive significant, dedicated budgetary support from the hospital, Boston HealthNet health centers, or BMC departments in addition to phi lanthropic or grant funds. There are numerous other community services provided at BMC and in the community by BMC employees and medical staff to foster community health. Many of these programs are supported at the departmental level or through grants, philanthropy, or volunteerism. Some of the community benefits programs offered at BMC included the following: Needs Assessment BMC's assessment of the health care needs of the communities it serves is based on demonstrated need. The Medical Legal Partnership I Boston (MLP) is one of many examples of how demonstrated need informs BMC (BMC) co mmunity health improvement activities and services. In 1993, clinicians within the Department of Pediatrics understood that nutrition and home energy were root causes of poor health and development among their predominantly low- income pediatric patients. In response, MLP initiated the \"Energy Clinic\" in 2006 to provide targeted advocacy around issues of nutrition and home energy. Today, MLP is a national leader in medical-legal collaboration to address the root causes of pediatric poor health and development. MLP seeks to improve the health and wellbeing of people in poverty by addressing the non-medical barriers to health faced by low-income individuals. MLP allies lawyers and health professionals and creates access to legal services in the clinical setting to ensure that low-income patients' basic needs\u2014for food, housing, education, health care, and safety/stability\u2014are met. The national MLP network now extends to more than 80 sites across the country, spanning both urban and rural communities. Promotion of Community Health Special Support for Children and Families Child Life Program (CLP): The CLP helps children and families manage the stresses associated with hospitalization and illness. The Child Life Team is trained to help children and families understand the hospital experience and related feelings. The goals of the CLP are to: help children express their feelings in a safe and supportive environment; help children manage pain effectively; offer children choices that increase feelings of independence, self-esteem and trust; and assist with implementation of coping techniques during stressful situations. Children's Health Watch (CHW): CHW is a non-partisan pediatric research center that monitors the impact of economic conditions and public policies on the health and 1.0 IMP Amendment 1-47 well-being of very young children. CHW interviews families with young children in five hospitals across the nation, including BMC (4,500 patient interviews in FY11), that serve the poorest families. The database of more than 44,000 children, 80 percent of whom are minorities, is the largest clinical database in the nation on very young children living in poverty. Data are collected on a wide variety of issues, including demographics, food security, public benefits, housing, home energy, and children's health status and developmental risk. We seek to provide policy makers and advocacy groups with the evidence they need to shape policies that prevent child hunger and promote children's health. Pediatric Assessment of Communication Clin ic (the Autism Clinic): Since 2003, the Autism Clinic has provided evaluations and ongoing care for children of all ages when there is a pediatrician concern about autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and related conditions, or when they have a previous diagnosis of ASD. The primary service provided by the Autism Clinic staff is educational advocacy. The Autism Clinic's Educational Specialist provides direct support services to primarily low- income and/or immigrant families who have limited English proficiency and are most challenged by the complex regulations gover ning the special education system. As needed, she travels to classrooms to observe young patients with ASD and to help families access the proper special education placement for their children, much faster than these families could manage on their own. Approximately 600 new patients and 1,000 families are served annually. Birth Sisters and Perinatal Care: BMC has developed two programs, Birth Sisters and Centering Pregnancy, to improve health ou tcomes of childbearing women at risk for poor maternal and infant outcomes. Birth Sisters are women who are trained to provide social support and education to mothers from their own communities during pregnancy, labor, and the postpartum period. The Birth Sisters program has been linked to significantly higher breastfeeding rates and fewer cesarean deliveries. Centering Pregnancy is an innovative and proven model of care that offers prenatal care in 10 two-hour group sessions using a BMC-developed curriculum. At these sessions beginning early in the second trimester, patients receive health visits, prenatal and parenting education and peer group support all in one visit. The programs support 334 patients. Supporting Parents and Resilient Kids Center (SPARK): SPARK is a therapeutic day program for Boston's most vulnerable children, including those living with HIV/AIDS; those born very prematurely; those who have suffered psychological trauma due to abuse/neglect; and those with complex medical and emotional needs. SPARK staff provide medical, educational, nutritional, and mental health services to vulnerable children from birth to age 22. SPARK operates an Early Childhood Day Program, a School-Age After-School Program, a young adult Job Training Program and a Summer Camp Program, serving approx imately 100 children annually who live throughout Eastern Massachusetts. SPARK helps children to build positive social 1.0 IMP Amendment 1-48 networks, positive self-regard and community belonging. Additionally, the program provides parenting education and support. Medical Legal Partnership Boston (MLP Boston): MLP Boston seeks to improve the health and wellbeing of people living in pov erty by addressing the non-medical barriers to health that low-income individuals so often face. MLP Boston allies lawyers and health professionals and creates acce ss to legal services in the clinical setting to ensure that low-income patients' basic needs\u2014for food, housing, education, health care, and safety/stability\u2014are met. In FY11, MLP Boston served 1,000 individuals. Margaret M. Shea RN Adult Day Health Program: This program offers families peace of mind and a support system to help them with decisions involving the care of their loved ones. It is a holistic medical interventi on program that provides services in an ambulatory, home-like setting for adults who do not require 24-hour institutional care, but because of physical and/or mental impairment, are not completely able to live independently. All participants are referred to the program and are screened before entering the program. Services offered by the program include nursing, social services, activities and transportation. Responding to the Needs of Patients Affected by Violence Child Protection Team (CPT): A special services division of the Department of Pediatrics, CPT serves all of BMC's maltreated pediatric patients. The CPT has three major areas of responsibility: 1) supporting BMC providers to ensure that maltreated children treated at BMC are protected; 2) improving the effective identification and response to maltreatment through innovative research and program development at BMC and nationally; and 3) providing training and education to pediatric health and other professionals in the recognition and management of child maltreatment. CPT collaborates with community and state agencies, law enforcement personnel and the judiciary system to ensure the best possible outcome for children and families. Child Witness to Violence Project (CWVP): CWVP is a nationally-recognized and award-winning counseling, outreach, and consultation program that focuses on young children under the age of eight who are exposed to domestic or community violence. The CWVP offers a flexible combination of services to children and their families, including: intensive trauma-focu sed counseling that is developmentally tailored to very young children and their parents; access to legal advocacy; and assistance with linking to other necessary services including health care, child care, housing, and after-school programs. In 2011, the CWVP provided trauma-focused counseling services to 90 children, and brief consultation/advocacy for an additional 200 families. The training/clinical consultation component of the program delivered 100 trainings across Massachusetts and 12 states. 1.0 IMP Amendment 1-49 Domestic Violence Program (DVP): The DVP provides training and education for staff, assistance with hospital policy and protocol development, consultation on a variety of clinical and research initiatives, as well as direct advocacy/support services for survivors of domestic and dating abuse. In 2009, a Safety and Support Advocate position was created to provide a range of advocacy and support services to patients referred from a range of adult and adolescent settings and providers. The DVP served 200 individuals in FY11 by pr oviding services such as crisis intervention/counseling; risk assessment and safety planning; assistance with accessing protective orders, victim com pensation; accompaniment to court, legal, medical, housing and other appointments; referral to community-based DV advocacy/rape crisis counseling, medical/mental health services and other support as needed. Violence Intervention Advocate Program (VIAP): In April 2006, BMC piloted VIAP to provide specialized services to victims of violence, using two community health workers, Violence Intervention Advocates, to provide individual counseling, triage and referral services for victims of violence brought to the BMC Emergency Department. VIAP staff collaborate with public and private agencies to offer a broad spectrum of concrete services to patients recovering from violent injury. Each VIAP site has hired a peer Violence Intervention Advocate VIA with strong community knowledge. In FY11, VIAP provided services to a total of 415 victims: 178 gunshot victims and 237 stabbing victims. Of these victims, 34 were female. VIAP provided the following direct services and referrals to services to victims and 34 families: crisis intervention and stabilization; housing and transportation; legal; educational; vocational and life skills development; mental health; employment; and health and wellness. Community Outreach Cancer Screenings: BMC offers an annual free cancer screening event to vulnerable, underserved individuals in order to promote the early detection of cancer. Because BMC serves a predominantly minority and low-income population, including many non-English-speaking citizens and immigrants, the delivery of exceptional care requires a keen sensitivity to the challenges for our patient population. The Saturday cancer screenings effectively reach our target population because they create a convenient time for people who work to access screenings, and allow husbands and wives to support each other as they both are screened. A total of 240 people from Boston and surrounding areas attended the 2011 screening event. Flu Vaccine Day: BMC began its 2010-2011 influenza vaccination campaign in September of 2010 making influenza vaccine available to all patients in both the inpatient and ambulatory care settings. To date, BMC has administered more than 31,348 doses of vaccine. A Safety Net for Special At-Risk Populations 1.0 IMP Amendment 1-50 The Metro Boston Jail Diversion Program (JDP): Since 2006, the JDP has worked with 529 individuals with mental health and/or co-occurring mental health and substance dependence whose associated behavior brings them to the attention of law enforcement and courts. The JDP collaborates with the police and courts to both identify individuals with these risk factors and connect them with appropriate services and treatment as alternatives to arrest and incarceration. The JDP is training Boston Police Department and Massachusetts Bay Transit Authority officers to identify individuals with mental illness and how to refer individuals to services instead of arresting them. At the court level, 56 JDP participants have successfully completed probation rather than being incarcerated. Boston Center for Refugee Health and Human Rights (BCRHHR): The mission of the BCRHHR is to provide comprehensive health care for refugees and survivors of torture and related trauma, coordinated with legal aid and social services; educate and train agencies and professionals who serve these communities; advocate for the promotion of health and human rights in the United States and worldwide; and conduct clinical, epidemiological, and legal research for the better understanding and promotion of health and quality of life for survivors of torture and related trauma. In FY11, the BCRHHR served more than 500 patients. Elders Living at Home Program (ELAHP): In FY11, ELAHP provided housing search and placement to 14 homeless older adults, and housing stabilization services to an additional 60 formerly homeless individuals. None of the vulnerable clients served during the year relapsed into homelessness, although two individuals did require nursing home placement due to significant declines in their cognitive abilities. The goal of ELAHP is to help older adults locate and maintain a permanent residence and allow them to live as independently as possible. Healthy Nutrition and Exercise Food Pantry: The Preventive Food Pantry and Demonstration Kitchen address hunger-related illness and malnutrition among a low-income, largely underserved and vulnerable patient population of Greater Boston. Individuals at risk of malnutrition are referred to the program by BMC or Boston HealthNet physicians or nutritionists who provide \"prescriptions\" fo r supplemental food that best promotes physical health, prevents future illness, and facilitates recovery. The Food Pantry now provides nutritional food prescriptions to approximately 7,000 people each month. Over the past five years the P antry has seen an 87% increase in demand for its services. In 2011, the Pantry provided 252,228-worth of food to an estimated 13,902 people. This number is expected to rise by 5% in 2012. Approximately 10,000 pounds of food supplies are required weekly to stock the Pantry shelves at BMC. The Demonstration Kitchen complements the work of the Pantry by educating patients about nutrition through cooking methods that are compatible with their medical and dietary needs, as prescribed by their physicians. 1.0 IMP Amendment 1-51 Grow Clinic: As part of BMC's Pediatrics Department, the primary goal of the Grow Clinic is to provide comprehensive multidisciplinary medical, nutritional, social services and dietary assistance to children from the Greater Boston area diagnosed with Failure to Thrive (FTT). Children with FTT have significant difficulty growing because of malnutrition associated with poverty, illness and family stress. The effects of FTT include shortened attention spans, emotional problems, delayed cognitive development, lasting growth failure, and frequent and serious illness, which can result in hospitalization. In 2011, the Grow Clinic provided medical treatment, nutritional assessment, home health educati on, family advocacy, access to a therapeutic food pantry and other services, children's clothes, diapers, books and educational toys to a total of 225 patients/families. Adult Weight Management: The Nutrition and Weight Management Center offers several programs, such as weekly support groups for weight management and a cancer survivor's weight management group, for the community aimed at supporting healthy lifestyles and nutrition. More than 500 patients benefited from these services in FY11. Nutrition and Fitness for Life Program (NFL): The Department of Pediatrics works to prevent the onset of adult diabetes in young, underserved, and overweight and obese patients through its NFL, which pr ovides clinical and community-based services to children and their families. The NFL model features three primary components: 1) clinical services targeting children with >95 percentile of body mass index; 2) the FANtastic Kids after school program which provides teen-mentored nutrition education and fitness activities for overweight and obese youth who are referred to the program by their physicians; and 3) continuing medical education for clinicians to increase their capacity to treat pediatric overweight patients in the primary care setting. These programs fill a large gap in services to populations most strongly impacted by the pediatric obesity epidemic. Basic Needs Clothing Bank: BMC's social workers access the clothing bank in real time when a provider contacts Social Work about a basic clothing need (sweat pants, shirts, underwear, socks, shoes, and winter coats) for a low-income patient. Social Work Emergency Fund (SWEF): The SWEF provided short-term, immediate assistance to approximately 550 patients who faced crises in FY11 and had nowhere else to turn. The Fund enables BMC to cover the costs of emergency expenses while its social workers help individuals and families find the resources and services they need to stabilize their lives after personal crises. We provide cab vouchers for those unable to access public transportation to get to BMC, and car seats and clothing to young families. SWEF has the flexibility to provide for a range of needs and the judicious use of funds helps in a number of unique situations when, too often, individuals and families have no alternative. 1.0 IMP Amendment 1-52 Removing Barriers to Accessing Care New England Flight: BMC is a Boston MedFlight (BMF) partner. BMF is a Commission on Accreditation of Medical Transport Services (CAMTS) accredited Critical Care Transport service. Boston MedFlight commits to excellence in critical care transport by providing the highest quality regional critical care transport system. As a non-profit organization, Boston MedFlight transports emergent patients regardless of their ability to pay and is financially supported in part by a consortium of Boston hospitals including BMC. For over 25 years, Boston MedFlight has played an integral role as part of the Massachusetts EMS system and the community hospitals of New England. Patient Navigation: The Patient Navigation program is designed for patients with cancer and chronic illnesses, such as diabetes, who need special assistance in navigating the health care system. Patient Navigators are individuals from the communities served by BMC and who have special language skills, training in scheduling, and refined compassion/communication skills. Peer Navigators contact our most vulnerable patients and help them to access the doctor visits and treatment that they need in the most efficient manner possible, arranging transportation for patients, reminding patients about appointments that they helped the patients to schedule, and connecting patients to community resources such as the BMC food pantry. Shuttle Buses/Taxis: Community Access to BMC is enhanced through a free shuttle bus service. Four buses circulate throughout the system on established routes, from 7am-7pm, Monday through Friday, bringing pati ents to BMC. In FY11, these shuttle buses transported 199,936 patients and their families between BMC and the Boston HealthNet CHCs. There is also a direct taxi and van hospital-to-home service for specific cases. Interpreter Services: BMC values its diverse patient population and is committed to honoring their ethnic, religious and cultural differences. The Interpreter Services Department is the most extensive in New England. In addition to providing person-to- person interpreters on-site in more than 30 languages, 24-hours-a day, the department utilizes the latest advances in technology such as telephonic and video interpreting. Interpreter Services goes above and beyond what is mandated by law to provide video interpreting, non-essential document translation (such as appointment reminder letters, bereavement letters), translation and recording of clinic phone menus, and 24/7 on-call face-to-face coverage for our top four languages Our interpreters help to break language barriers as well as serve as cultural brokers to patients and staff. Last year, they assisted in 190,647 interactions with patients and visitors. 1.0 IMP Amendment 1-53 Addressing Significant Public Health Problems Diabetes: The BMC Diabetes Center provides innovative and up-to-date diabetes education and care to help patients better understand and manage their diabetes. Located in the Endocrinology Clinic, the Diab etes Center provides culturally and literacy-appropriate education about nutrition, menu planning, exercise and medication management to the most chronically ill patients with diabetes. Care providers also train patients to better manage their insulin regimens. A patient navigator on the team assists patients in appointment scheduling and transportation needs, for patients with challenges in retaining their appointments (see patient navigation). Smoking Cessation: BMC's Division of Psychiatry offers a medically supervised Smoking Cessation Program. The program is an eight week, one hour per week classroom model with a curriculum that includes pharmacotherapy, nicotine replacement (gum and patches), stress reduction training, cognitive restructuring, social support, and relapse prevention coun seling. This clinical resource for BMC patients also serves as a center for training and research in tobacco control available to the entire BMC community. Improving Quality of Life Acupuncture: Acupuncture services at BMC are provided free of charge to more than 600 patients annually who do not have affordable access to complementary alternative medicine (CAM). Cancer Support Groups: In 2006, BMC established the Cancer Patient Support Services Fund to provide crucial services and programs to complement patients' clinical care. The fund is used for survivor ship programs such as support groups and celebrations, assistance with transportation costs to and from the hospital, patient navigation, and the provision of complementary therapies such as yoga and massage. In FY11, there were 15 cancer support groups that met regularly and as many as 650 patients who participated in the survivorship programs. Integrative Medicine: The mission of the In itiative for Integrative Medicine and Health Disparities within the Department of Fam ily Medicine, which served approximately 250 patients on a rotating basis in FY11, is to substantially impact the quality of life for the urban underserved through providing access to integrative medicine clinical services, research and education. Services provided, primarily free of charge, include yoga classes, integrative cancer care, acupuncture clinics, chi gung class, music therapy, and integrative medicine consults. Empowering Individuals with Disabilities Stepping Forward-Staying Informed Consumer Education Program: Stepping Forward-Staying Informed is a two-pronged consumer education program consisting 1.0 IMP Amendment 1-54 of an annual one-day research conference tailored to consumers and a bi-monthly evening lecture series. Stepping Forward-Staying Informed presents topics that directly relate to living with Spinal Cord Injury (SCI), such as current research findings and emerging effective treatment techniques, in easily understood, lay terminology. Individuals living with SCI and their families seek current information about spinal cord injury research and em erging treatments because it enables them to advocate on their behalf, make informed decisions about care, and share information with other individuals. The Stepping Forward-Staying Informed conference has become a relied upon source of information for consumers and healthcare professionals. Affiliated Health Care System: Boston HealthNet Health Care System Established in 1995, Boston HealthNet (BHN) is an integrated health care delivery system comprised of BMC, the Boston University School of Medicine, and 15 community health centers (CHCs). Physicians who practice at HealthNet locations provide a wide range of comprehensive health care services to adult and pediatric patients, with a focus on disease prevention and health education. Patients receiving primary care at HealthNet sites have access to highly trained specialists and cutting-edge technology at BMC while maintaining individualized and culturally sensitive care in their neighborhoods. Now in its 17 th year, BHN and its CHC partners have extended BMC's presence into Boston-area neighborhoods, significantly impacting the health of their residents. The accomplishments of the network are evidenced by: the growth of CHC admissions to BMC; the establishment of an inpatient Rounder System for CHC patients; the collaborative development of quality improvement initiatives, clinical protocols, and standards of practice; increased access to specialty services; a successful public health outreach campaign; and the significant development and coordination of BHN's information technology programs and services. In 1997, Boston HealthNet established a Community Physician Group Inpatient Rounder System at BMC. The Rounder System brings together physicians from the CHCs and the BMC Department of Family Medicine to care for patients from these centers while they are in the hospital, thereby coordinating and enhancing the quality and continuity of care. Today, 12 CHCs and BMC's Department of Family Medicine participate in the Rounder System. The System was reconfigured in 2008 into thr ee teams, comprised of BMC and CHC attending physicians assisted by three nurse partners and four physician assistants. In 2008 the Rounder System was extended to evenings and seven day coverage. The Average Length of Stay for the Rounder System was 4.39 days, wh ich compares favorably with other national and local indices. Boston HealthNet CHC partners are active collaborators on a number of projects and programs described in this report, including the Prostate Cancer Screening Initiative, patient navigation research, the FANtastic Kids program to address pediatric overweight, and Medical-Legal Partnership. Additional examples of projects on which BMC and Boston HealthNet have collaborated include: 1.0 IMP Amendment 1-55 Information Technology Significant strides have been made in the area of information technology across the network. All of Boston HealthNet's primary CHC partners are connected to BMC over high-speed T-1 lines that put BMC's clinical systems at the fingertips of CHC providers and other staff. In 2001, the partnership between BMC and the CHCs, coupled with a substantial grant from an anonymous foundation, supported the implementation of the Centricity electronic medical record (EMR) at eight of the primary partner CHCs. In 2008 implementation was completed at one secondary partner CHC. Additionally, electronic prescribing was implemented at the nine Centricity sites. A Working Group meets monthly to address developmental issues and to evaluate and prioritize future projects. A three year, $746,246 HRSA award to Boston HealthNet in FY07 supported the vertical integration of electronic medical records at eight CHCs with that of BMC. This integration took place via implementation of a Clinical Information Exchange (CIE) that now allows CHC providers to view information in both BMC and other CHC systems through the local patient record. The CIE also allows physicians in the CHCs to better track patients receiving care at BMC. In 2008, the network was a recipient of a one-year, $543,000 high impact health information technology grant from HRSA that allows staff to implement an electronic referral management system between the 10 BHN primary partner CHCs and specialists in the BMC Department of Medi cine. By leveraging the technology of the CIE, the eReferral system also makes it possible for the CHCs to schedule appointments, electronically submit required c linical information to specialists, receive electronic information about referrals, track patients' no-show rates, and receive return specialist reports through the local EMR or by opening a web-based practice portal. In 2010, Boston HealthNet received a two-year, $2,986,872 grant from HRSA to help complete the transformation of current Health Information Technology capabilities into a truly integrated, high-performance health information exchange with the capacity to handle all necessary clinical, administrative and financial functions. To this end, project funds are being used to install the Centricity Practice Solution at five CHCs; to implement immunization and diabetes registries for the entire BHN network, including BMC; to fully automate laboratory order entry and results retrieval for 12 of the CHCs; to automate reporting of Uniform Data System measures and HRSA Clinical Performance Measures in all 15 CHCs; and to create a data warehouse for the CHCs. In 2011, the Yankee Alliance, Inc. awarded BMC $454,967 for the Balanced Scorecard/Safe Sign-outs project, to begin retroactively on October 1, 2011 and finish September 30, 2012. BMC Balanced Scorecard is a continuation project to move to the next level in developing a computer dashboard system to drill down on patient safety and quality. This project will focus on the provider level metrics development and testing. Safe Sign-Outs is a new sy stems development project to create a 1.0 IMP Amendment 1-56 software system and protocol for resident safe sign-outs to prevent patient adverse events. Also in 2011, Boston HealthNet received a two-year HRSA grant to implement a series of Health Information Technology initiatives that integrate databases and electronic alerts in standardized systems in order to improve the quality, effectiveness and efficiency of primary care. The project will implement clinical and financial practice management software that is fully integrated wi th the electronic health records at five CHCs, reducing the number of custom ized interfaces and licenses needed and providing crucial business intelligence; create system-wide childhood immunization and diabetes registries; automate reporting of Uniform Data System data, HRSA clinical performance measures and selected practice management metrics; and create a data warehouse for the CHCs. The project will benefit the more than 334,000 Boston HealthNet patients and the clinical impact of the proposed will include significant increases in the number of children fu lly immunized by age two years and adherence to the standards of the National Committee on Quality Assurance for diabetes care, and a significant decrease in the percent of patients with uncontrolled diabetes (HbA1c > 9). Increasing Patient Access Community Access to BMC is enhanced through a free shuttle bus service. Four buses circulate throughout the system on established routes, from 7am-7pm, Monday through Friday, bringing patients to BMC. Last year, these shuttle buses transported 199,936 patients and their families between BMC and the Boston HealthNet CHCs. Advancing Medical Education A number of HealthNet CHCs also serve as the primary community-based training sites for Boston University School of Medi cine pediatric, family medicine, and general medicine residents. 1.9.1.2 Employment, Workforce Development, and Educational Opportunities BMC is a major employer in the City of Boston and is committed to promoting employment opportunities for Boston residents, particularly individuals living in adjacent neighborhoods.

As part of Boston University's commitment to Mayor Menino's Step UP initiative, GSDM also offered oral health services to four schools\u2014English High School, Orchard Gardens K-8 School, John Winthrop, and the William Monroe Trotter School. Oral health education was provided to 618 students in these schools, and 195 students received dental screenings, fluoride varnish treatments, and/or dental sealants through this program. CityLab In 1992, Boston University School of M edicine (BUSM) pioneered an innovative science education outreach program that has been replicated across the country. CityLab provides Boston Public Schools students and teachers in grades 7-12 with access to state-of-the-art biotechnology laboratory facilities and curricula, which are unavailable in most schools, through the use of its mobile laboratory and on-site laboratories at the School of Medicine. 1.0 IMP Amendment 1-63 Framingham Heart Study Undertaken in 1948, the renowned Framingham Heart Study is the longest-running prospective epidemiological study in history. The study has produced important discoveries related to the major risk factors associated with cardiovascular disease, which is the leading cause of death and serious illness in the United States. The study is run in partnership with the Boston University School of Public Health and the Boston University School of Medicine. Blackstone Elementary School Annual Field Trip to the Goldman School for Dental Medicine (GSDM) Third grade children at Blackstone Elementary School make an annual visit to GSDM for a full day of oral health activities, including presentations on oral health and nutrition, a lesson on teeth and gums, and interactive activities in the Simulation Learning Center in which they learn about sealants and dental impressions. One of GSDM's most successful outreach programs, it provides both interactive health education for children and an opportunity for Boston University dental students to inspire a young child to pursue a higher education and possibly a career in dentistry. Outreach Van Project Founded in 1997, the Outreach Van Project is a student-run community service staffed by volunteers from Boston University's School of Medicine and School of Public Health to provide health care to the medically under served and homeless communities. Faculty and students go out one evening per week to East Boston to conduct free health screenings and distribute clothing and other basics necessiti es to approximately 20 to 30 people weekly during the colder months and 65 to 75 people weekly when the weather is warmer. Preschool and Kindergarten Dental Health Education Preschool and/or kindergarten classroom dental health education is conducted each year by GSDM faculty and students, and goodie bags with toothbrush, toothpaste, and stickers are given out at the end of each session.

In response to a community needs assessment conducted by the Boston Centers for Youth & Families (BCYF) and the Boston Public Health Commission and in conjunction with community discussions, Boston University is proud to announce the implementation of the Boston University Heal th, Fitness, and Wellness Pilot Program, an initiative aimed at combating obesity and promoting a healthy lifestyle for Boston's youth and their families. Additionally, BU Medical Campus was also recently selected by the City of Boston as one of three local partners to implement a biotechnology workforce training program known as the BioScience Academy. Boston University Health, Fitness, and Wellness Pilot Program Boston University launched the Boston Univer sity Health, Fitness, and Wellness Pilot Program in early 2013. The unique program aims to combat teenage obesity in the City of Boston, and supports Boston Moves for Health, an ambitious initiative launched by Mayor Thomas M. Menino to increase access to free and low-cost physical activities and health living resources. The Boston University Health, Fitness, and Wellne ss Pilot Program provides access to quality fitness training, nutrition counseling, and wellness programming to children, youth, and families in at-risk communities. The program's location at the BCYF Blackstone Community Center was chosen for its potential to maximize outreach to at- risk youth and families, as well as for its proximity to additional health resour ces available at the Boston University Medical Center, the South End Health Center, and other neighboring community-based agencies. Boston University will renovate the space to suit the program's needs and objectives. The program is directed and guided by experts from the University's College of Health & Rehabilitation Sciences: Sargent College, and the Schools of Medicine, Public Health, and Social Work, and staffed and supervised by me mbers of the University's Department of Physical Education, Recreation & Dance (PERD). Through wellness programming and fitness instruction, University staff strives to prov ide youths and families with the skills needed to make physical exercise and healthy choices an enduring part of their lifestyles. The program is open to BCYF Blackstone Community Center members and youth ages 14 and older, and accounts for a 36-hour-per-week commitment from Boston University. BioScience Academy Launched in fall 2012, the BioScience Academy is a workforce development program that provides biotechnology training to unempl oyed and underemployed Boston area residents. Program funding stems from the Metro Boston Skilled Careers in Life Sciences (SCILS) initiative, a four-year $5 million grant that the City of Boston received from the U.S. Department of Labor to grow and maintain the area's life sciences workforce. Boston 1.0 IMP Amendment 1-65 University was selected as one of three training partners to implement the biotechnology training program, for which Boston University contributes half of participants' tuition. Students receive professional development training and a Certificate in Applied Biotechnology upon completion of twelve course credits through the School of Medicine and Metropolitan College. 1.9.2.2 Economic Impact 19.2.2.a Employment In addition to educating future health care professionals focused on community, the schools of the BU Medical Campus extend employ ment and professional development opportunities to the people of Boston and the surrounding communities, as well. BU Medical Campus employs approximately 2,047 full-time equivalent employees and 351 part-time employees. Of these, 509 are Boston residents. Employment at the BU Medical Campus is expected to increase in proportion to moderate increases in student enrollment and the development of research programs. Table 1-7 BU Medical Campus Employment (FY13) BU Medical Campus Employment (2013) Full-time Part-time Total Total Employees 2,047 351 2,398 Boston Residents 475 34 509 BU Medical Campus Employment (2013) [Including Temporary Employees] Full-time Part-time Total Total Employees 2,107 Boston 495 137 632 19.2.2.b PILOT (Payment-in-lieu-of-taxes) Program & Linkage Payments As a nonprofit educational institution, Boston Univ ersity is tax exempt; however, motivated by a sense of responsibility as one of Boston's largest employers and landowners, and by its commitment to giving back to the community, in the 1980's Boston University began to make 1.0 IMP Amendment 1-66 payments to the City of Boston in lieu of the taxes from which it was exempt. These \"PILOT\" (payment-in-lieu-of-taxes) funds help the city co ver the cost of providing essential services, such as police, fire, and snow removal. These payments account for the University's properties and activities on both the BU Medical Campus and the Charles River Campus. Boston University was the first educational institution in the City of Boston to make such voluntary contributions, and continues to make substantial PILOT payments. In FY2012, Boston University contributed $5.3 million in PILOT payments to the City of Boston. Since FY2006, Boston University has also pai d more than $1 million in linkage payments for new developments on the BU Medical Campus. 1.9.2.3 Local Infrastructure Improvements and Beautification Initiatives In addition to operating 5 free shuttle services within the South End area and between the BU Medical and Charles River Campuses at an appr oximate cost of $1.75 million a year, the BU Medical Campus also makes significant contributions to local urban beautification efforts. In the early 2000s, the University committed $246, 000 to the construction of a \"pocket\" park on Albany Street, and also installed and maintains planting beds along the median islands stretching from Albany Street to Shaw mut Avenue along Massachusetts Avenue. BU Medical Campus is also a proud participant in Mayor Menino's year-round neighborhood clean-up and community service program, Boston Shines 365, through which volunteers plant flowers, sweet, rake, and pick up trash to keep Boston's neighborhoods clean and beautiful. 1.9.2.4 Scholarships Community Scholars Program For full-time working professionals interested in pursuing a Masters in Public Health part-time, the Community Scholars Program encourages experienced health professionals to pursue advanced study for an MPH while continuing their full-time employment. Up to ten half-tuition scholarships are awarded annually to MPH degree candidates depending on the competiveness of the applicant pool. Eligible ap plicants have at least two years of experience and are currently employed full-time in public health related nonprofit or government agencies. In FY2011, Boston University awarded nearly $129,000 in scholarship aid for local full-time working professionals pursuing an MPH degree. 1.0 IMP Amendment 1-67 Table 1-8 Boston University Scholarship Aid CityLab Academy In FY2011, Boston University contributed $72,360 to the operation of CityLab Academy, a program based on the Boston University Me dical Campus.

These programs are part of the Boston University Medical Campus' long-standing commitment to community service, public health, and social advocacy through student service-learning and faculty service. Select community programs are summarized below. Co mprehensive descriptions of all community programs offered through the Medical Campus can be found in Appendix C, BU Medical Campus Community Outreach Initiatives. Boston University School of Medicine offers medical students a unique service-learning experience through community based medicine and social advocacy programs. The programs include: Outreach Van Project - Founded in 1997 by School of Medicine and School of Public Health students, students under the supervision of a licensed physician provide food, clothing, and reliable, consistent medical care to the underserved, predominately Hispanic community of East Boston where 25 percent of children live below the poverty line. The Outreach Van Project is currently the only outreach agency supporting the underserved community in East Boston. Project MED HEALTH (Helping Educate Adolescents to Live Tomorrow Health) - School of Medicine students lead interactive, technology based educational workshops for Boston Public School children on key health issues such as nutrition, fitness, safety, puberty, and sex education. Codman Square Fiscal Health Survey & Intervention - A partnership of School of Medicine students and leaders of Codman Square community based organizations working together to explore the links between communi ty economics, community health, effective listening, effective advocacy, and racism. The Henry M. Goldman School of Dental Medicine has an unwavering commitment to improving oral health and quality of life in communities through strategic partnering, health education and promotion, and implementation of public health initiatives. Goldman School of Dental Medicine programs serve as national models for training dental students and non- dental health professionals to provide oral health services for disadvantaged populations. The Goldman School of Dental Medicine's work includes: City-wide Dental Health Programs - These city-wide dental health programs operate in public schools in Boston, Chelsea, Frami ngham, and Lawrence. The programs provide oral screenings, sealant placement, fluoride applicati ons, and oral health education. Similar services are provided at Early Head Start, Head Start, and other preschool programs in the greater Boston metropolitan area. 1.0 IMP Amendment 1-73 Chelsea School Dental Center - Since opening in April of 2003, the Chelsea School Dental Center (CSDC), which is managed by GSDM and located in the Williams Middle School, has provided preventive and restorative services for thousands of children. The CSDC gives care to Chelsea public school students regardless of their grade level or ability to pay for services. Many of the patients, who range in age from preschoolers to high school seniors, have never been to the dentist and would have no other source of dental care if it were not for the CSDC. Five bilingual dentists devote time to treating patients in the clinic. Health Promotion for the Underserved - Over 50 other oral health promotion programs for underserved populations with programs targeted to serve the homeless, financially disadvantaged, uninsured and underinsured, elders, survivors of torture, refugees, and individuals with HIV. The Boston University School of Public Health has a long standing, service-oriented philosophy evidenced by the combination research and academics with a practicum requirement involving work experience in a public health environment. Through longstanding collaborations with the Massachusetts Department of Public Health, the Boston Public Health Commission, and the Veterans Affairs Administration, and international alliances with the Red Cross, the Peace Corps, and foreign governments, School of Public Health students, faculty, and alumni draw on their own diverse backgrounds to carry out the School's mission in a variety of settings. Some examples of programming include: Refugee and Immigrant Health Program Since 1996, the Refugee and Immigrant Health Program, a joint project of Boston Medical Center, the Department of Medicine at Bost on University's School of Medicine, Global Lawyers and Physicians, and the Department of Health Law, Bioethics & Human Rights at Boston University's School of Public Health, has actively cared for the medical, psychological, legal, and social needs of more than 500 clients each year. Clients hail from 57 countries and live in and around Boston. It is a multidisciplinary center that provides services for refugees and survivors of torture and related trauma. The program provides primary health care, mental health services, referrals for medical specialties, neuro-psychiatric evaluation, dental evaluations of persons in detention, physical therapy, referral and consultation for legal services, social services, English classes, creative therapies, and vocational rehabilitation. The program also offers a clothing bank, access to the BMC Food Pantry, and ethnic community support groups. Public Health Education Week During Public Health Education Week, School of Public Health (SPH) students, with support from faculty and staff, conduct high school education programs in Boston public schools. SPH students speak with high school students about the relevance of public health in their everyday lives, health promotion, dis ease prevention, and health protection. 1.0 IMP Amendment 1-74 1.10 Project Benefits The proposed BMC projects will: Elevate Quality of Care Consolidation and modernization of clinical care areas within the campus core allows for improved patient care and operational efficiency. Provide right-sized patient care space to accommodate emergency single expanded emergency department, located in the M enino Pavilion, and clinical programs therefore improving timing and quality of patient care. Relocate the Emergency Department Entrance and drop-off to the rear of the Moakley Cancer Care Center and relocate the loading dock to the south side of Albany Street. This will allow separation of service areas from patient care areas and reduction in vehicular and truck traffic on Albany Street. Improves patient transport from the heli pad and directly connects to the Emergency Department on the north side of Albany Street to provide more efficient patient care. Improve the Pedestrian Environment Create a defined pedestrian experience along East Concord Street by engaging the east face of the building with the sidewalk. Provide sidewalk and landscape improvements along the perimeter of the building to enhance the pedestrian experience. Relocate the MBTA bus stop on East Concord Street from the street edge closer to the building to provide users as well as traversing pedestrians with protection from the elements. Eliminate three of the existing curb cuts on the north side of Albany Street and consolidate the remaining curb cuts to eliminate vehicular and pedestrian conflicts and enhance the overall pedestrian experience. Facilitate the demolition of the existing yellow utility tube which will continue to the transformation of the Albany Street image. Allow for closure of one of the two existing lanes underneath the existing yellow utility tube minimizing and reducing the width of the curb cut and contributing to an improved pedestrian experience. Improve Access to and through Boston University Medical Center Create a more optimal intersection configuration at Shapiro Drive and East Concord Street to provide visual clarity for vehicular traffic turning right onto East Concord Street. Provide improved circulation and vital c onnections to adjacent campus buildings improving operational efficiency. Better define the north edge of Albany Street and improve the image of Albany Street and the BUMC Campus as its major arrival point. 1.0 IMP Amendment 1-75 Advance Sustainable Design, Green Building and Technology Goals Shrink Boston University Medical C enter's carbon footprint through lesser greenhouse gas emissions and lower its impact on the local environment. Decrease Boston University Medical Cent er's impact on the locally taxed energy infrastructure by generating 75% of its electricity and 95% of its steam. Producing steam and electricity through cogeneration will decrease Boston University Medical Center's energy costs. Job Creation Create approximately 250 construction jobs. Provide Linkage Funds Contribution to the housing and jobs linkage fund. 1.11 Linkage Upon approval of the Boston University Medi cal Center IMP in 2000, Boston University Medical Center entered into a Development Impact Project (\"DIP\") Agreement with the BRA for its institutional projects which exceeded the threshold requirements of Article 80B of the Code. With the adoption of the IMP renewal for a new 10-year term commencing in 2010, Boston University Medical Center and the BRA entered into a new DIP Agreement which will govern all new projects which exceed the thresholds set forth in Article 80B of the Code. 1.12 Areas of Interest for Future Campus Expansion As the proponents look into the future and as trends continue to change for patient care and academic needs, they will continue to evaluate opportunities for future expansion. The proponents recognize the following sites, if available, as ideal locations for future expansion due to proximity to the existing BUMC Campus: Solomon Carter Fuller Building Chief Medical Examiner's Office Building Finland Building Flower Exchange Jacobson Floral Immaculate Conception Church and the attached Link Building Northampton Square Complex - Medical Office Building and storefronts 1.13 Institutional Master Plan Background / History Overview The original Boston University Medical Center Institutional Master Plan was approved by the Boston Redevelopment Authority on May 18, 2000 and the Boston Zoning Commission on 1.0 IMP Amendment 1-76 June 28, 2000, effective July 13, 2000. From 2001 through early 2010, the Proponents filed multiple IMP Amendments, Notices of Project Change, Project Notification Forms, and Notices of Exemption. In March 2010, the Proponents submitted their Institutional Master Plan Renewal Form. The IMP Renewal was approved by the BRA on June 22, 2010. Three new construction projects were included in the 2010 IMP: a 48,000 square foot Energy Facility located to the east of the existing Power Plant, a 160,000 square foot Administration/Clinical Building located on the surface parking lot on the north side of the Power Plant (along Albany Street), and a 405,000 square foot New Inpatient Building located on the current Dowling Building site.
