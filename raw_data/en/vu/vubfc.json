For the past few years, I've been consciously transitioning into clean, earth-kind and non-toxic living while trying to maintain a mindful approach based on self-reflection, open-mindedness, soul-searching and courage. I've used my decade-long experience as a desk and field research analyst in the asset management industry to develop a [framework](https://nontoxicsteps.eco/sustainabilityratings/) to aid me in my non-toxic journey. I've applied due-diligence required to analyze stocks, examine annual results and management practices to scrutinizing products, questioning allopathic medicine and choosing healing methods that promote and optimize rather than sustain health. Seeds to my health journey were sown by the two most influential women in my life - my mother and grandmother - during my modest upbringing in my home country Lithuania. My soul-searching started however in my second-home Sweden where I spent thirteen years studying, working and figuring out life in Stockholm. But it was not until my husband and I moved to Dubai as expats in 2014 where I also birthed two of our three boys when I started digging really deep. Since we moved to Costa Rica in March 2021 however, we've been having hard time finding clean, effective and high-quality products that we were used to. So I created this online store to partially scratch my own itch but also to serve the community who, like me, has been going through a similar struggle. My goal is to prioritize and make available as many locally produced alternatives as possible and opt for imports only when there are no other suitable options here in Costa Rica. Why toxins matter? [Toxins cause disease](https://nontoxicsteps.eco/whytoxinsmakeussick/). I could stretch as far as to claim that toxins together with stress are the root cause of most diseases. That's why it's so important to reduce our toxic load, which can be both physical and emotional. When toxins enter our bodies, they start causing oxidative stress. It's a process whereby a toxin acts as a free radical causing damage to the cell membrane. You can read more about it [here](https://nontoxicsteps.eco/whytoxinsmakeussick/). Our state of health is a reflection of the environment we live in, community we are part of as well as our mental state. Unfortunately, as we've lost connectedness to the natural world, we've become accustomed to believe that our health is something we outsource to the \"experts\". While there are certainly time and place when medical intervention is necessary and even life-saving, I truly believe that we need to start listening more to our intuition rather than any authority. We know our bodies best - if we tune in and take time to listen and reflect that is. I'm here to help you build a healthier lifestyle one non-toxic step at a time! Convenience of the [modern lifestyle](https://nontoxicsteps.eco/climatechangeandhealth/) has come at a cost: we are overexposed to various toxins daily. Air, water, food, products we use, [EMF radiation](https://nontoxicsteps.eco/emfradiation/) and stress are some of our most common exposures. Luckily, there's so much we can do to optimize our well-being. It starts with making conscious and consistent choices - all day, every day. Yes, things do add up! Some decisions are as easy as getting rid of plastic food containers or Teflon pans. Some, like improving our diet or creating a healing ecosystem, will surely take longer time. To reduce initial resistance for change, I've myself chosen to break bigger steps into smaller and less intimidating ones - hereof the name of this site. We are talking hacks, tweaks, incremental changes that slowly but surely have put our family on a path of healing. Simply put, they all fall in one of the three categories (ARO): 1. Avoid - things, thoughts, habits, people - whatever or whomever doesn't serve your wellbeing 2. Replace - the old with new less toxic version of what was burdening you - physically or emotionally 3. Optimize - choose what suits you in the season you're in - from medicinal herbs to health-tech - and biohack yourself back to a state of bliss In other words, we start by avoiding or at least limiting things or experiences in our environment that we know harm our health as well as boosting your exposure to factors that help us elevate ourselves to a true state of wellness. I'm so convinced about the power of a single step, I've created a reminder on [one of my favorite products ](https://nontoxicsteps.eco/product/handmade-coconut-inspo-bowl/)that we constantly use at home: \"A journey of a thousand miles starts with a single step\". I hope that here you'll be able to find tools that help you on your non-toxic journey - wherever you are in the ARO cycle. "}
