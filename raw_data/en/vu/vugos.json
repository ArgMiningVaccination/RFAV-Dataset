Each bowl emit a powerful, pure resonant sound. Each quartz crystal singing bowl set is fine tuned to a specific chakra (please see the chart). The tones produced by these crystal bowls are not just heard by the ear, you feel them in your body, affecting your energy centers (chakras) for healing, mindfulness & meditation. These bowls are much more reverberating with the tone lasting longer, simply because of the size specific tuning and amount of pure crystal.

Although this mainly focuses on the root chakra, you will feel the sound reverberate starting from the base to your upper chakras. The F note Heart Chakra is our second most popular and the two pair really well. We recommend the C or F note as a good starting point for all round chakra balance, meditation, sound healing, relaxation and of course exceptional value for price. Lastly the A note Third Eye chakra is known to open up our third eye or Ajna. Awakening the third eye can be highly effective at healing imbalances and is a mystic spiritual quest for many around the world. Even if you're not actively seeking enlightenment or spiritual harmony, a healthy 6th Ajna chakra promotes intuition, pattern recognition, learning skills, and memory Of course if your budget allows we always recommend getting the full set of 7 bowls for complete healing. The notes harmonize with others and when played simultaneously, the healing effects are quite exquisite and synergistic. Larger sizes will produce deeper sounds that resonate longer.

Simply put, it's an energy center or areas of the body that is dense with energy. They're usually associated with the psychological or energy body, rather than the material/physical body, although several of the chakras correspond to areas that have vital organs, such as the heart, brain, and reproductive organs. There are 7 main Chakras. 1st Chakra Note C: Being depleted of first chakra energy feels like a survival crisis. You can't get grounded because you are stuck in your head. By contrast, if you have too much energy at the root, you can become greedy or excessive in behaviors. These are misguided attempts to get grounded. 2nd Chakra: When someone is stuck in their sacral chakra, they struggle with being ruled by their emotions or the opposite of this, which is feeling numb or out of touch. There's also a correlation to sexual desire (or the lack thereof) at this level. Creativity and pleasure are both found at this energetic level. 3rd Chakra: This chakra is often considered the power center, and when out of balance, self-esteem may be low and decision-making can feel out of control. Temper flare-ups are also common when energy isn't flowing well here. 4th Chakra: The heart chakra, when flowing with energy, feels filled with love, compassion, forgiveness, and acceptance. When there's a blockage at this energy level, anger, jealousy, grief, or self-hatred can be more prominent. 5th Chakra:This chakra is the source of speaking your most authentic truth. When energy is blocked or low here, fear of not being accepted or of being judged becomes a problem. You might also feel out of touch with your opinions and desires and have challenge in making choices. 6th Chakra: The word Ajna means \"beyond wisdom,\" and when this chakra is open, you experience expanded imagination, clairvoyance, and intuition. When there is a blockage at this level, there can be a tendency to be over-involved in fantasy or imagination. Lack of focus or clouded judgment can also occur. 7th Chakra: The crown chakra connects you to the wider universal energy, so when this area has a block, isolation or emotional distress can occur. This may present as an inability to set or follow through on goals or an overall lack of direction and feelings of disconnection.

Have regular bowl healing sessions to keep your aura strong! Below images show the chakra energy balance before and after singing bowl sessions over a one month period. (Dr. Konstantin Korotkov's Bio-Well human energy field assessment tool The above before and after client images were taken with a bio-resonance system. Please note in the first Aura Photo that the Client's Aura needs alignment/healing work with their out of balance and unfocused chakras. (The more circular a chakra the more balanced and focused it is. Brighter colors indicate balanced, high energy, and positive qualities of chakra. Dark or 'murky' tones indicates low energy, unbalanced and stressed chakra activity. This goes for the surrounding aura in general as well.) As you can see, after the singing bowl sessionthe client's chakras have been balanced, energized, as well as the surrounding Aura itself much clearer with the Crown or 7th chakra very bright indeed.
