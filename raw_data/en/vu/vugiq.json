Students are admitted to Presentation Co llege on a probationary basis and fail to ea rn a term GPA of 2.00 in the admitting semester Students may request appeal of a suspension within the timeframe designated in the suspension letter. If appeal of the suspens ion is not granted, students may seek readmission to the College as unclassified students af ter one semester of suspension. Academic suspension will be noted on the transcript. The readmission process to Presentation Colle ge requires students to write a letter to the Vice President for Academics, detail ing a proposed plan for addressing the issues whic h led to the academic suspension. Requests for readmission will be reviewed by the Vice President for Academics. Conditions for readmission will incl ude entrance on probationary st atus, along with the required participation in an academic improvement plan that may incl ude additional methods of remediation, mandatory counseling, mandatory appointments with the academ ic advisor, and/or specific class or clinical attendance requirements. Other Grounds for Academic Suspension/Probation 1. Students may also be given an official warning and subseque nt probation or suspension for continued absences from class, continued failure in assignments over a period of time, or an attitude depicting a lack of motivation and interest as documented by faculty over a period of time. Continuation of the condition after a semester of probation will be considered grounds for suspension. 2. The physical, mental and emotional wellbeing of students is an essential component of educational development. Therefore, students may be requested by the College to submit evidence of health as determined by a physician or other qualified professional any time during the course of the students' educatio n. If students are believed to be an immediate threat to the safety of themselves or others, the Colleg e reserves the right to request students to obtain immediate professional assistance, to withdraw, or to take a leave of absence for a specific peri od of time. The College reserves the right to request that a physician or other qualified professional be given authorization by students to provide written documentation to Presentation College stating that they are in good physical, mental and emotional health. Administrative Withdrawal The College reserves the right to administra tively withdraw students from a class or all classes if, in the judgment of the app ropriate College officials, such withdrawal is in the best interests of the students and the College. A \"WF\" grade is given to students with a College-initiated withdrawal after the last date to withdraw in each semester. A \"W\" may be given prior to the last date to withdraw. A \"WF\" is computed into the grade point averag e as 0.00 grade points per credit hour. Active Duty A student who is a member, or the spouse of a member if the me mber has a dependent child, of the national guard or reserve forc es of the United States and who is ordered to state military serv ice or federal service of duty has the following options: 1. Withdraw from the student's entire registration and receive a full re fund of tuition and mandatory fees. 39 Presentation College 2012-2013 2. Make arrangements with the student's instructors for course grades, or for incompletes that shall be completed by the studen t at a later date. If such arrangements are made, the student's registration shall remain intact and tuition and mandatory fees shall be assessed for the courses in full. 3. Make arrangements with only some of the student's instructors for grades, or for incompletes that shall be completed by the student at a later date. If such arrangem ents are made, the registration for those co urses shall remain intact and tuition and mandatory fees shall be assessed for those courses. Any co urse for which arrangements ca nnot be made for grades or incompletes shall be considered dropped and the tuition and mandatory fees for the course refunded. If Title IV eligible students wi thdraw due to being called to ac tive duty with the Armed Forces of the United States or have be en otherwise impacted by military mobilization, the College performs the Return of Title IV Funds calculations that are required b y Federal statute and regulations (34 CFR668.22). Academic Recognition President's List To be eligible for the President's List, students must have achi eved a semester GPA of 4.00 taking at least 12 credits on a gra ded basis, with no grade(s) of Incomplete during the seme ster they are eligible for the President's List. Dean's List To be eligible for the Dean's List, students must have achieved a semester GPA of 3.50 or higher taking at least 12 credits on a graded basis, with no grade(s) of Incomplete during th e semester they are eligible for the Dean's List. Honors at Graduation Academic Honors at commencement are based on cumulative GPA th rough the fall semester preceding graduation. Students who graduate with honors must have no grade lower than \"C.\" Only Presentation College credit hours and grades are used in the computation. Actual degree honors will be based on the cumulati ve GPA at the time the degree is awarded and will be noted on t he diploma and official transcript. To be eligible for honors, Bachelor degree students must have 33 earned hours from Presentati on College with the following cumulative GPA: 3.90 to Summa Cum Laude 3.70 Cum Laude 3.50 to 3.69 Cum Laude To be eligible for honors, Associate degree and Certificate studen ts must have 18 earned hours fr om Presentation College with t he following cumulative GPA: 3.90 to 4.00 with Highest Honor 3.70 to 3.89 with High Honor 3.50 to 3.69 with Honor Academic Standards and Appeals Academic Integrity - Policies and Procedures Inherent in the mission of Presentation Co llege is the strong belief in the principle of academic integrity. Students' actions reflect their moral character and, by extension, the Coll ege's reputation. Therefore, all students are expected to recognize and abide by th e following: It is a major responsibility of students and faculty to promote academic integrity. The College will not tolerate violations b y cheating, plagiarism, fabrication and other academic misconduct. Cheating Students who cheat are claiming credit for work that is not of their own creation an d for knowledge that they do not possess. Students are violating their own integrity as well as the integrity of th e College. Examples of cheating include copying answers from a nother student on tests and class work; permitting someone else to copy answers from their test and wo rk; inappropriate use of text me ssaging or other forms of electronic communicati on; using information and aids for test questions that have been prohibited. Plagiarism 40 Presentation College 2012-2013 When students apply or employ the words, id eas or work of someone else without proper documentation, they are plagiarizing the author of that material. St udents who plagiarize, either intentionally or unintentionally , violate their integrity and the integrity of the College by claiming work that is not of their own creation or invention. Students should be aware that, even when they do not intend to plagiarize, they might still be technically guilty of academic misconduct if sources are not properly acknowle dged and credi ted. Both intentional plagiarism and inaccurate documentation are thre ats to the integrity of the indi vidual and the College. Clear thinking and responsible work depend on careful use of evidence, respect for other writers and the courteou s and credible treatment of o ne's readers. Plagiarism includes the copying of words, sentences or passages from a text (this includes books, magazines, newspape rs, pamphlets, another student's paper or a paper prepared by so meone other than the student wh o submitted the paper) without indicating the source of those words, sentences or passages; using quotations inaccurately (exact wording and punctuation); paraphrasing or summarizing another writer's ideas, even if the writer is not quoted directly, without giving adequate credit t o the author; failing to give adequate bibliographical information for referential purposes; and using graphs, charts, tables or othe r printed and visual aids with out giving credit to the source of that information. Fabrication If students deceive members of the academic community by inve nting information or providing mi sinformation, the students are fabricating. Fabrication includes, but is not limited to, listing false bibliographical references; citing information not tak en from the source indicated; falsely claiming the completion of a clinical , internship or field experience ; inventing data or sources for academic assignments; taking quizzes or exams under false pretense; and fa lsely taking credit for another student's work in group projec ts. Actions Related to Academic Integrity Because breaches of academic integrity vary in degree and seriousness, actions taken against violator s will be left to the disc retion and judgment of the individual faculty member. If requested, the Vice President for Academics will serve as a reference for mediat ion. When a faculty member discovers a violation of academic integrity, students will be notified in writing within ten (10) busines s days of the charge. The faculty member and student wi ll then meet to discuss the violation and the action to be taken. Actions that m ay be taken include but are not limited to the following: 1. Students will receive an \"F\" grade or \"0\" (zero) on the exam, paper, pr oject, coursework, etc. 2. Students will be failed in the course 3. Students will be dismissed from the major Students may appeal the faculty member's decision or action by following the Student Appeal/G rievance Process that follows. For all serious and substantiated violations of integrity judged by the faculty to be intentional, the faculty member will submit in writing to the Vice President for Academics a description of the violation and the action taken ag ainst the student. Offenses which are considered serious include, but are not limited to, intentional ch eating, plagiarism, or fabrication on a project, exam, etc. Upon evidence of two serious violations, students will be dismissed fr om the College. The Vice President for Academics will send a written notification of such dismissal to students , the Vice President for Student Services, an d the Registrar. Students may appeal th e dismissal in writing to the Vice President for Academics if they have ev idence that the action was unju st, oppressive, discriminating or unfair. Student Appeal/Grievance Process Purpose The appeal/grievance process is designed to afford all students a means to redress an y form of unjust, oppressive, discriminato ry, or fundamentally unfair practice affecting stud ent academic performance or progress. Such identified practice may be either acade mic or non-academic in nature. Academic/Non-Academic Appeal/Grievance Defined For the purpose of the policy and procedures that follow, academic/non-academic appeals/grievances refer to a substantial compl aint of a serious nature. It is students' claim of injury or wrong resulting from a decision, practice, or act by a member or membe rs of faculty, administration, or staff, which is arbitrary and capricious, unjust, oppre ssive, discriminatory, fundamentally unfair, or exceeds the limits of academic freedom. For any matter to give rise to such an appeal/grievance subjec t to these procedures there must be clear and convincing evidence, which demonstrates either arbitrary or capricious action on the part of the individual faculty, admini stration, or staff member or action which is oppressive, discriminatory, fundamentally unfair, or which exceeds the limits of academic fr eedom. The evidence must also establish that such action was injurious. In all such appeal s or grievances, the burden of proof and pe rsuasion is upon a student. 41 Presentation College 2012-2013 Academic/Non-Academic Appeal/Grievance Process Students who wish to appeal or grieve academic or non-acad emic actions/decisions are to follow appropriate channels of communication in seeking reso lution of differences. Note: Ordinarily a final grade may not be appealed. In order for students to pursue an appeal of a final grade, they mu st have specific concrete evidence that th e grade was either erroneously or unfairly awarded. A challenge to a grade received in a course, comprehensive examin ation or other graduation requir ement will be considered only when the students allege that the grade received reflects other than appropriate academic criteria, that is, achievement and profici ency in the subject matter as stated in the course syllabus. When students appeal a final grade, they will provide the faculty member with a copy of all petitions. Informal Phase: When students believe that they have a gr ievance or complaint related to their enro llment and successful progress at the Colleg e, within 10 business days of the action for which the grievance is being filed, students must approach the instructor/staff/ administrator directly and attempt to reach an understanding at that level. In thos e rare instances where students believe tha t a direct approach might prejudice their standing, they may bring the problem directly to the a ttention of the instructor/staff person's supervisor or Department Chair. The Informal Phase shall last no longer th an two weeks from the date the grievance wa s initiated. Formal Phase: Level 1. In those instances in which a satisfactory resolution is not secured in the Informal Ph ase, and in those instances whe re the grievance involved more than a single event/course or College employee: 1. Students should provide written notification of their complaint to the appropriate Department Chair and/or area supervisor within two weeks after the completion of the Informal Phase. 2. The Department Chair/Supervisor may discuss the ma tter with the students and any involved faculty/staff separately or together. a. If the situation warrants, the Department Chair/Superv isor may solicit the views and opinions of other faculty members, staff, and/or students on the matter at i ssue and may use any departmental appeal or grievance mechanism that has been established. b. A written decision must be given to all parties invo lved within 10 business days from the date Level I was initiated. Level 2. In those cases where a satisfactory resolution has not been secured at Level 1: 1. Students may, in writing, request a conference with the appropriate College administrator (Vice President for Academics, Vice President for Finance, Vice President for Enrollment, or Vice President for Student Services). 2. In attempting to reach a clarification and resolution of the grievance, the administ rator should meet with the concerned parties within five business days after th e written decision has been rendered in Level 1. a. Prior to this meeting the administra tor should have memos or letters from all involved persons stating the issues and describing the decisions re ached in previous meetings. 3. At the meeting with the administrator, each pers on concerned should review all letters and memos. a. New evidence relevant to the case may be brought forth at this time. 4. After studying the facts, the administrator shall make a deci sion. This decision must be given to all parties involved within 10 business days from the date Level 2 was initiated. Level 3. In the event that students or th e faculty/staff member cannot accept the decision reached by the administrator, within five business days after the written de cision has been rendered in Level 2: 1. They may apply, in writing, for a hearing before the Committee on Student Grievances (CSG), whose composition of five members is as follows: a. Academic Grievance i. The Presentation College Student Senate President shall appoint two st udents from Student Senate, who are not from the department in which the grievance or iginated, to serve as student representatives. ii. The President of Presentation College Faculty Assembly sha ll appoint two faculty members, who are not from the department of the grieved facult y, to serve as faculty representatives. iii. The Vice President for Academics shall appoint an academic Department Chair, who is not from the department of the grieved faculty, to serve as the CSG Chairperson of the committee chosen to hear the grievance. b. Non-Academic Grievance 42 Presentation College 2012-2013 i. The Presentation College Student Senate President shall appoint two st udents from Student Senate, who are not from the department in which the grievance or iginated, to serve as student representatives. ii. The Vice President for Student Se rvices shall appoint two College staff members, who are not from the department of the grieved staff person, to serve as College staff representatives. iii. The Vice President for Student Se rvices shall appoint an Area Staff Supervisor, who is not from the department of the grieved staff person, to serve as th e CSG Chairperson of the committee chosen to hear the grievance. 2. The five members will be notified by the appropriate admi nistrator that they have been chosen to hear a grievance with the notice to state the time, date, and place of the hearing. 3. During the hearing, all indi viduals directly involved in the grievance must be present. a. All letters, memos, documents and other tangible evidence introduced in previous hearings must be available to all parties at the hearing. b. All parties to the grievance have the right to obtain wi tnesses. The College will c ooperate with the grievant in securing witnesses and in making available specifically identified and relevant documentary and other evidence requested by the grievant, to th e extent not limited by law. c. There must be a tape recording of this hearing. 4. After careful consideration of all the evidence relevant to the grievance as presented at the hearing, the CSG, by a majority vote, shall make a recommendation to the President of Presentation College regarding the disposition of the grievance within 30 days after the close of the hearing. Minority reports regarding the final disposition of the grievance shall be included with the recommendation. Level 4. The President renders the final institutional decision based upon a review of the record and the recommendations, findings, and conclusions of the CSG and may: 1. Affirm the decision of the CSG; 2. Remand to the CSG with specific instructions for further findings or conclusions; 3. Conduct such further investigation or hearing as the President deems necessary; or 4. Reverse or modify the recommended disposition of the CSG. a. If the President determines to reverse or modify the recommended dispos ition, the President shall state in detail the disagreement with the recommended disposition of the CSG. b. If the President disagrees with the findings or conclusions of the CS G, the President shall make available the findings and conclusions that are supported by a preponderance of the evidence in the record. The President shall notify the parties involved by written de cision rendered within 15 da ys after the issuance of the recommended decision of the CSG. Graduation Requirements Because of the critical nature of the education and licensure es tablished by the State and/or a ccrediting agencies, many of the programs at Presentation College require more hours to meet graduation requiremen ts than are typical of some College programs. For exam ple, the Associate of Science in Radiologic Technology program requires 84 credit hours. Associate degrees in the Department of Art s and Sciences are conferred upon the completion of program requirements and with a minimu m of 60 hours and a cumulative GPA of 2.00. A candidate for a degree or certificate for graduation is expected to be present fo r commencement ceremonies. A candidate for a degree or certificate must file an application on the website at the time designated in the acad emic calendar, usually at the t ime of registration for the final semester. Students who lack the requ ired credits for a certificate or degree may apply to the Vice President for Academics to participate in the May commencement ceremony of that year if they are within 11 credits of degree completion. The diploma will be awarded after students comp lete all requirements. Students who fail to complete all remaining requirements by the end of the next regular academic semester after they co mmenced will be required to re-apply for graduation. Names of graduating students are listed in the commencement program for the May ceremony of that year. Once a student's name h as been listed in a commencement program, whether or not the studen t chooses to participate in that commencement, the student's na me will not be listed in a subsequent program nor will the student be allowed to participate in a subsequent commencement unless t he student is graduating with a new degree or certificate. Students follow the requirements of the cata log in place at the time of enrollment into the major. If College or major require ments are changed, students may opt for the new requir ements. Students who withdraw or are dismissed from the College or a major must follow the requirements of the catalog in pl ace at the time of readmission into the Co llege or major. The College reserves the right to change requirements. 43 Presentation College 2012-2013 Students who have completed the requirements for graduation but who have outstanding financial obligations to the College will receive the certificate/diploma and a rel ease of transcript upon clearing their fina ncial obligation with the Business Office. 44 Presentation College 2012-2013 PRESENTATION COLLEGE GENERAL EDUCATION PROGRAM BACCALAUREATE DEGREE PROGRAMS (6/2011) Educational Philosophy and Purpose In recognition of our diverse, rapidly changing world, Presentation Co llege's general education pr ogram prepares undergraduate students for responsible citizenship, ethical leadership, and careers or further education.

The SDEA (South Dakota Education Association) and NEA (National Education Association) Student Program provides many opportunities for students to learn, share and soci alize with peers and with practici ng educators. As a member o f the student program, students will ha ve the opportunity for professional and leadersh ip development training, to attend conferences and workshops, to participate in community service projects, to re ceive teacher education publications and acquire professional lia bility insurance coverage while in the classroom. Teaching with Technology (Electronic Textbooks and Tablet PC Recommendation) In recent years integration of instructional technology into the classroom has become a significant part of education. Teacher s need to understand the ways in which these new tools can make a signific ant difference in student learning. Therefore, the Department of Education remains on the cutting edge of technology by utilizing electronic textbooks and Tablet PCs, among a variety of other hardware and software used to enhance fu nctionality, classroom activities, and student learning, for all education courses. Electronic textbooks are an excellent altern ative to print books since with them studen ts can search a specific word or topic, copy/paste text into their coursework, comment within the textbook, and enjoy a lighter backpack ---all for about half of what a print text book costs! In addition, the Presentation College Depart ment of Education recommends students to pu rchase a Tablet PC in lieu of the Presen tation College policy of acquiring a laptop. Tablet PCs contain the power of a laptop computer with many additional benefits. Using a Tablet PC, students can create, edit, and organize handwritten notes in a searchable digita l format, capture text and drawings, mathem atical formulas, etc., that can be converted to typed text in a matter of seconds. With Microsoft One Note, students can synchronize notes with audio and/or video recordings and pres entations to textbooks anyplace they go. For minimum specifications of the Tablet P C, see the Department of Education web site at www.presentation.edu/education . 106 Presentation College 2012-2013 107 Presentation College 2012-2013 DEPARTMENT OF NURSING The Department of Nursing offers the Bachelor of Science in Nu rsing and Associate of Science in Nursing programs.

The degree program is accredite d by the Council on Social Work Education (CSWE) an d prepares students for the Generalist prac tice. Generalist practitioners work with individual, families, groups, organizations and communities. A ge neral practitioner enables people to enhance their own proble m- solving and coping abilities, advocates for human operation of soci etal systems, and links people with resources. Therefore, t he generalist perspective requires that students learn competenci es in a wide array of areas rather than specialization. Graduates will be prepared to intervene in a purposeful manner, utilizing knowledge of people and environment as well as the et hics of the profession to guide their behaviors. Upon graduation students will have achiev ed the ten Core Social Work Competencies as identified by the Council on Social Work Education-Educational Policy and Accreditation Standards. Students with a BSW degree have a wide range of career possibilities. As noted by the National Association of Social Workers Guide for Schools and Programs of Social Work, social workers are employed in: \"schools, hospitals, mental health facilities, senior center, private practices, prisons, the military, corporations, government, private and public agencies\" (NASW 2008, p. 3).
