Our ancestors have been treating ailments such as common colds, fatal fever 'dengue', and many more chronic illnesses with the help of Ayurveda. On the basis of the idea that a disease is caused due to an imbalance or stress in a person's body, Ayurveda promotes certain lifestyle changes mixed with natural therapies to maintain a balance between the body, mind, spirit, and the environment you surround yourself with. On the other hand, Allopathic treatment (also known as Western Medicine) has become a profound and highly popular field of medicine that is based on running tests and gaining evidence of diseases in the body. Allopathic medicines are widely beneficial for medical emergencies, where you are severely injured and/or recently had a surgery that is indeed painful once the anesthesia stops working. There is always a debate when it comes to proving the effectiveness of Allopathy and Ayurveda, but determining a conclusion on the same is still a questionable affair. While allopathic medicine views the illness as an attack on the body, and the treatment as a fight mechanism against it, Ayurveda approaches the disease as friction in the body, and the treatment as bringing the process of bringing back the balance of the body. Allopathy is highly effective in achieving accurate test results such as blood count, presence of sugar, vitamins, and minerals, bone, or brain scanning. Even some ayurvedic doctors may advise you to first present your test reports to get a sense of your condition and then prescribe medicines to you accordingly. But if you visit an allopathic doctor, he will rarely prescribe an Ayurvedic medicine because legally a doctor should only prescribe medicine for his field of knowledge and not something that he/she hasn't studied. We can't deny the fact that there has been a notable increase in the life expectancy of humans from 30 to 50 years after the introduction of allopathy, but the rise of a various number of disorders and diseases due to allopathy cannot be denied as well. Ayurveda on the other hand can have positive effects when used as a complementary therapy in combination with standard, conventional medical care. Even though the concepts of diseases and the treatments are diametrically opposed from the perspective of Allopathic and Ayurvedic medicine, they both aim to heal the human body. Ayurveda and Allopathy have influenced the life of humans to a great extent in their own ways. "}
