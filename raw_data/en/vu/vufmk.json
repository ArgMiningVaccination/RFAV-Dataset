Although grants for education decreased somewhat, there were increases of varying size in welfare services, employment secur- ity administration, health services, grants for public assistance and other and all other purposes. As a result, total grants increased 10 percent from the $3,092 million of 1954-55 to $3,405 million for 1955-56 (table 1).

The largest increase (12.2 percent) occurred in the youngest of the four categorical aid programs-aid to the permanently and totally disabled, which completed its fifth full year in 1955-56. During the year, the plans submitted by Florida and Ne- braska were approved for Federal participation, bringing to 45 the total number of approved State plans (and of States receiving grants in 1955- 56). Seven States and Alaska still had no federally approved plan in this assistance category at the end of the fiscal year. Despite a slight increase from the preceding year in the dollar amount Bulletin, June 1957 11 granted for each public assistance program, their total represents only 42.7 percent of all Federal grants- the lowest proportion since 1940-41. This drop is explainable partially in terms of the growing importance of other continuing grant programs and the addition of new grant programs, as well as in terms of the changing economic conditions and continuing expansion of the old-age and survi- vors insurance program that have led to a considerable degree of sta- bilization in State public assistance outlays. Grants for public assistance are the largest made by the Federal Government for any one purpose. Second in order of dollar magnitude are the regular and emergency high- way construction grants. From 1950- 51, when the fourth public assistance program was added and assistance grants reached the alltime peak per- centagewise, grants for public assist- ance and highway construction have represented the following proportions of total Federal grants: Percent of total grants Year Public Highway assistance construction 19~51.-- _________._.. 52.9 17.8 1951-52 .___ __......-... grants represented 79.2 percent of the grants adminis- tered by the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare in 1955-56, compared with 78.6 percent in 1954- 55. For the past 3 Ascal years they accounted for 98 percent of the Social Security Administration grants; the remainder was for the three Chil- dren's Bureau grant programs. Federal grants for the administra- tion of the State unemployment in- surance and employment service pro- grams amounted to $227 million, 20 percent more than the $189 million of 1954-55. Although these grants, like all grants, are made from the general funds of the Treasury, they have been regarded as coming from the portion of the Federal unem- ployment tax against which employ- ers are not permitted to offset their payments under State unemployment insurance laws. Administrative costs of the employment security Programs in the States have never equaled the amount of the Federal collections (0.3 percent of taxable payrolls). Un- der the Employment Security Financ- ing Act of 1954 (Public Law No. 567, Eighty-third Congress, second ses- sion) the excess-up to $200 million -of collections over administrative costs is appropriated to the Federal unemployment account within the un- employment trust fund. From the fund thus established, States with depleted reserves may borrow to help pay benefits.1 Amounts in excess of $200 million are allocated to the ac- counts in the unemployment trust fund of the various States in the same proportion that their covered payrolls bear to the aggregate payroll of all States. Such an allocation was made on July 1, 1956, of the $33.4 million above the legal maximum paid into the Federal unemployment account up to the end of the fiscal year 1955-56. Grants for health services in 1955- 56 totaled $133 million, 13.3 percent more than the 1954-55 sum but still less than in 1953-54. Health grants reached an alltime peak of $183 mil- lion in 1951-52 and then declined each subsequent year through 1954- 55. In 1955-56, grants under continu- ing programs totaled $105 million, 10.5 Percent less than the amounts granted for the same programs in the preceding fiscal year. In addi- tion, a total of $28 million was grant- ed in 1955-56 for the emergency poliomyelitis vaccination program- $24 million under the Poliomyelitis Vaccination Assistance Act of 1955 2 to be used by the States for purchas- ing the vaccine and/or for adminls- tration and $4 million under the general health assistance emergency grant authority to aid State health departments in the administration of 1 One loan of $3 million to Alaska has so far been made. Alaska repaid this loan Dec. 28, 1956, but then immediately (Jan. 3, 1957) took out another, for $2.6 million (the legal maximum, based on the largest amount paid in benefits in any of the 4 preceding quarters).

These two emergencY Pro- grams account for the rise in total health grants. Among the COntinUing programs, grants were about the same as in 1954-55 for maternal and child health services and for control of tuberculosis, cancer, and heart disease. Grants were lower for hos- pital construction ta decline of $18.5 million or 25 percent) and for con- struction of community water-treat- ment facilities in defense-impacted areas (a program in liquidation). They were somewhat higher for gen- eral health assistance, crippled chil- dren's services, control of venereal disease, and mental health activities. Grants for welfare programs other than public assistance rose $36 mil- lion (25 percent) in 1955-56 to a total of $177 million. Vocational re- habilitation grants increased 29 per- cent to $33 million. The greatest growth occurred in the school milk grant program, new in 1954-55, which more than doubled in 1955-56 to a total of $50 million. Grants for the other programs in the group remained at about the 1954-55 level. Grants for health services and for welfare services other than public assistance together represented 9.1 percent of all Federal grants in 1955-56, a slightly higher proportion than in the 2 preceding fiscal years. Education grants amounted to $209 million in 1955-56, $30 million less than in 1954-55. The reduction was attributable almost entirely to a de- crease of $31 million or 26 percent in school construction grants. All other education grants either re- mained approximately the same or increased very slightly. From 1934- 35 through 1950-51, grants for edu- cation ranged from less than 1 per- cent to slightly more than 3 percent of all Federal grants and averaged 2.4 percent of the total. In 1951-52 they increased sharply, both in dollar amount and as a percent of the total. In that year they formed 4.8 percent of total grants; in 1952-53, 7.8 per- cent; in 1954-55, 7.7 percent: and in 1955-56, 6.1 percent. Grants for all other purposes totaled $1,203 million in 1955-56, $225 million or 23 percent more than in 1954-55. The components of this 12 Social Security heterogeneous group, which are ad- ministered by half a dozen Federal agencies, and the amounts granted in recent fiscal years are shown be- low.

Source: Grants data are from the Annual Report of the Secretary of the Treasury on the State OJ the Fi- nances for the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 1.956, and are on the basis of checks issued in the fiscal year. Personal income data are for calendar \"par 19% and are from the Survey of Current Business, August 1956. State general revenue data are for the fiscal year 1956 and ore from the Summary of State (fonernment Financee in 1956 (Bureau of the Census). Per capita grants are based on estimates by the Bureau of the Census for the total population, &cluding the Armed Forces overseas, as of July 1, 1956. about $10 from the $39 of the pre- ceding year, while in the low-income group the range increased by about 50 cents. For the middle-income group, average total grants per capita rose from $21.56 in 1954-55 to $23.02 in 1955-56. Here, too, the range widened; it was $30.17 in 1955-56 (from $15.66 in Wisconsin to $45.78 in Wyoming), compared with $23.84 in 1954-55 (from $13.41 in Wisconsin to $37.25 in Wyoming). Both the total grants and those for public assistance, health, other wel- fare services, and education tend to vary inversely with per capita per- sonal income. In general, the grants average somewhat higher per capita in the low-income States than in the middle-income group, and higher in the middle-income States than in those of the high-income range. In many of the programs the grant-in- aid formula for distribution of Fed- eral funds is designed to achieve at least a minimum degree of equaliza- tion in the program among all States. In 1955-56, as in previous years, there was an observable tendency for per capita grants for employment secu- rity administration to vary in direct relationship to State per capita in- come. The \"all other\" category, in- cluding as it does grants for activities at least partly concentrated in urban and suburban areas as well as exclu- sively rural programs, cannot be an- alyzed on the basis of income and population relationships. Grants for many purposes are higher per capita in the sparsely pop- ulated \"public land\" States than in other States as a result of the opera- tion of minimum allotment provisions and certain allocation formulas. In Nevada, for example, which ranked third highest in terms of per capita income and where grants amounted to $59.80 per capita, in comparison with $20.42 for the continental United States, 57.0 percent of total grants to the State went for highway con- struction. Wyoming, first in the mid- dle-income group, received $45.78 per capita in grants, and 59.9 percent of the grants was for highways. New Mexico, fourth among the 16 low- income States, received $42.16 per capita in grants. Of this total, 34.5 Percent was for highways and 24.0 Percent for public assistance. The Social Security situation was similar in other West- ern States. Total grants per capita are also significantly high in States that spend relatively large sums from State and local funds for their pub- lic assistance programs, because of the Federal matching requirement in the Social Security Act. Oklahoma, for example, with total per capita grants of $43.29, received 53.9 per- cent of its total grants for public assistance. More than 63 percent of total grants to Louisiana went for public assistance; total grants per capita were $36.71. In 1954-55, how- ever, grants for public assistance were 57.7 percent and 68.5 percent of total grants in these two States, and grants per capita were $39.91 and $32.66, respectively. In 1955-56, total grants per capita were slightly higher for the Terri- tories and possessions, taken as a group, than in 1954-55 ($16.55 com- pared with $14.24). The average for the group, however, continued to be less than per capita total grants for the continental United States, mainly because of the significantly low per capita grants to Puerto Rico-the most populous of the Territories and possessions. These low per capita grants are occasioned, in turn, by the fact that the maximums on indi- vidual assistance payments in which the Federal Government will share and the Federal share of the pay- ments are lower for Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands than for the States; in addition there is an over- all dollar maximum on the Federal payment to these possessions. Relation to personal income.-Total grants to State and local governments as a percent of personal income re- ceived and of total State general revenues tend to be higher, on the average, in States with low per cap- ita income (table 3). These percent- ages are also high in the sparsely populated public land States and the States that make relatively heavy expenditures for public assistance. Federal grants represented 1.1 per- cent of personal income for the con- tinental United States and 18.0 per- cent of State general revenues. Grants to State and local govern- ments are presented here as percent- ages of total State general revenues, but they would be more meaningfully related to combined State and local general revenues. There is available, however, no complete and consistent series for recent years on total local government revenues, by State. Grants administered by the Social Security Administration totaled $1,489 million in 1955-56-$33 million or 2.3 percent more than the $1,456 mil- lion of 1954-55 and $22 million or 1.5 percent more than the sums granted in 1953-54. They represented 43.7 percent of all Federal grants, com- pared with 47.1 percent in the fiscal year 1954-55 and exactly half the total in 1953-54. These grants, on the average, equaled 0.5 percent of personal income in the continental United States and 8.0 percent of State general revenues. Here, too, the proportion tended to be larger in States with low per capita income. The percentage that Social Security Administration grants were of total grants varied only slightly among the three income groups of States, al- though State-by-State variation was considerably wider-ranging from 11 percent for Nevada in the high-in- come group to 64 percent for Louisi- ana in the low-income group. For the Territories and possessions, Social Se- curity Administration grants consti- tuted 23 percent of all grants and amounted to $3.77 per capita, com- pared with $8.99 for the continental United States. Expenditures for Assistance Payments from State-Local Funds, 1955-56\" For the country as a whole, State and local fiscal effort to support pub- lic assistance in the fiscal year 1955- 56 was about the same as it was 'a year earlier. The concept of fiscal effort used in the following analysis is a measure of the relationship be- tween the expenditures for public as- sistance payments from State and local funds and personal income. Nationally, the State and local share *Prepared by Frank J. Hanmer, Divi- sion of Program Statistics and Analysis, Bureau of Public Assistance. of assistance payments for 1955-56 amounted to 46 cents per $100 of personal income, compared with 47 cents per $100 of personal income in the preceding year (table 1) .i This insignificant shift in fiscal effort for the United States resulted from a slightly higher percentage increase in personal income than in assistance payments from State-local funds. Expenditures for assistance pay ments from State and local funds rose moderately in the fiscal year 1955-56, mainly as a result of higher assistance standards in each of the five public assistance programs. The increase of 3.8 percent in the non- Federal share of assistance payments for the United States represented an increase of $52.3 million. Underlying the total change in expenditures from State and local funds, however, was a rise of $68.7 million for the four federally aided categories and a de- cline of $16.4 million for general as- sistance, which is financed entirely from State and local funds. Despite higher average payments to recipi- ents of general assistance, annual ex- penditures for that program dropped because of a 14-percent decline in the number of individuals receiving as- sistance. Personal income for the year also rose moderately, but the percentage increase was slightly greater than that in assistance expenditures from State and local funds. The 6.5-per- cent rise pushed the total personal income for the United States to a new high of $304.3 billion in 1955. All but four States shared in the increase in total personal income that occurred between 1954 and 1955 (table 2). Percentage changes in in- come were much greater for the States with increases, moreover, than for those with declines. Shifts amounted to 5 percent or more in only two of the States with decreases but in 40 of the States with increases. North Dakota experienced the largest rise in personal income (16.1 per- 1 In this note, assistance expenditures for the fiscal years 1954-55 and 1955-56 are related to personal income for the calendar years 1954 and 1955, respectively.
