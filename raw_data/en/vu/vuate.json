Turns out a nagging [cough](/cough/guide/) or hoarse throat could signal the condition too. In this exclusive interview, we ask a leading medical expert to share symptoms, treatments and recipes for relief. ... About 100 million Americans have acid reflux, a condition in which contents of the stomach back up to the esophagus or higher. But more than half don't realize it, says Jamie Koufman, M.D., F.A.C.S., founder and director of the Voice Institute of New York, a treatment center for reflux, [gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)](/gerd/guide/), laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR) and other conditions that affect the voice. One reason, says Koufman - an authority on acid reflux, as well as a sufferer - is that some experience atypical, \"silent\" symptoms, such as coughing or postnasal drip. As a result, they and their doctors assume they're suffering from allergies or [sinus](/sinus-infection/) problems.Diet changes, as well as medication, are effective treatments for the condition. In her book, Dropping Acid: The Reflux Diet Cookbook & Cure (Reflux Cookbooks), Koufman teams with ear, nose and throat surgeon Jordan Stern, M.D., and French chef Marc Bauer to introduce a healthy eating plan for people with acid reflux. In this exclusive interview, Koufman shares clues you might miss, how to get help and low-acid recipes to get GERD or acid refluxsymptoms under control. Why do so many people have acid reflux? One reason is higher levels of acid in most foods we eat, especially those that are bottled or canned.In the 1970s, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) raised the levels of acid in prepackaged foods to discourage bacterial growth and prolong shelf life. But they failed to anticipate the adverse health consequences on people. Today, some prepared foods and beverages are as acidic as stomach acid itself. Who's likely to develop acid reflux or GERD? Research suggests a link between being overweight and developing acid reflux, but I've seen many patients at a normal weight or even very thin who also suffer from it. And although we once thought this disease only struck older people, we're seeing more in their 20s and 30s with the condition. Can you explain the \"silent\" symptoms people can get? Silent, or atypical, acid reflux can cause symptoms such as coughing (including a dry cough), chronic throat clearing, and the sensation of having something stuck in your throat. Many sufferers also have postnasal drip and have been told their symptoms are abnormal nasal drainage, infections or sinus problems. The medical term I coined for this is laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR). It results when hydrochloric acid [the main component of the stomach's gastric acid] backs into your throat, voice box and nasal cavity. That's opposed to gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), in which acid flows back into your esophagus. How does laryngopharyngeal reflux differ from GERD? GERD's main symptom is heartburn. Although some LPR sufferers complain of that, it isn't common among them. While there's a link between GERD and being overweight, many of the LPR patients I've treated aren't obese - though they often have poor dietary habits. Why is LPR so hard to diagnose? General practitioners often confuse it with a sinus or allergy problem, since patients don't have heartburn or indigestion.If you have chronic symptoms that haven't responded to sinus, allergy or [gastrointestinal](/digestive-health/common-digestive-conditions-from-top-bottom/) treatments - and have had other diagnostic tests done to no avail - I recommend consulting an ear, nose and throat doctor (ENT). They can look at your voice box and throat to determine if you have inflammation consistent with LPR. I see many patients who've consulted many doctors - allergists, gastroenterologists and other specialists - yet still haven't received a diagnosis or relief for their symptoms. It can be very frustrating. Women need to be their own health advocates and push for a referral to an ENT (also known as an otolaryngologist). If you think you have acid reflux, when should you seek medical treatment? Many women experience occasional heartburn or hoarseness. But if symptoms persist, occur more than twice a week or interfere with sleep or daily life, consult your doctor. How is acid reflux and LPR treated? Many cases can be effectively treated by diet modification. For some people, a histamine-2 blocker - over-the-counter medication such as Tagamet [cimetidine](/drugs/cimetidine), ranitidine or [famotidine](/drugs/pepcid-ac). All three suppress stomach-acid secretion and can help ease symptoms. In more severe cases, a doctor might prescribe a proton pump inhibitor such as [omeprazole](/drugs/prilosec), [lansoprazole](/drugs/prevacid) or [pantoprazole](/drugs/pantoprazole). These medications halt almost all stomach acid.There are several minimally invasive surgery options available to patients who don't respond to medications. You once suffered from acid reflux. How did you find relief? I had also developed a pre-cancerous lesion on my vocal cords, so I underwent reflux surgery [which reinforces the barrier between the esophagus and stomach] in 1998. Since then, I've modified my diet and practice self-discipline. I still have flare-ups if I don't watch what I eat. There was one evening where I enjoyed a late dinner with friends, complete with cocktails and a chocolate dessert. It took me 2-1/2 weeks to recover. How does the LPR diet plan in your book counteract symptoms? It starts with a 2-week, strict, [acid-free diet](https://www.everydayhealth.com/gerd/pictures-of-low-acid-foods-to-add-to-your-reflux-diet/), a kind of digestive system [detox program](/diet-and-nutrition/diet/detox-cleanses-most-popular-types-what-know/). It includes no fruit, except bananas and melons, and the main beverage is water - at least 8 cups a day, non-carbonated. More than half my patients have seen great relief after this period.Then certain foods can be added back in. I recommend people keep a food diary to see if any of these new items trigger symptoms. Here are three recipes from [Dropping Acid: The Reflux Diet Cookbook & Cure](https://www.refluxcookbook.com/). Jordan's Quickie Poached Salmon with Rosemary Serves 4 Ingredients 4 salmon filets (4 oz. each) 4 sprigs fresh rosemary 4 half-slices fresh lemon 1 teaspoon olive oil Preparation 1. Place each filet skin-side down on a sheet of aluminum foil large enough to wrap entire filet.2. Place lemon and rosemary on the filet and drizzle \u00bc tsp of the olive oil. Season with salt as needed.3. Wrap each filet in foil and place in a baking pan in the oven at 350\u00b0F for 10-15 minutes.4. To serve: Remove from oven, unwrap foil, remove the lemon (do not squeeze it on the filet) and the rosemary.5. Serve with rice and your favorite steamed greens. Notes: Prep time is about 5 minutes for the salmon. The tightly wrapped foil allows the filets to steam. The rosemary (or other herbs of your choice) and the slice of lemon impart great flavor. Since you're not squeezing the lemon on the fish, you can avoid its acidity while enjoying the flavor - especially from the lemon skin that steams along with the filets. You can leave out the olive oil drizzle if you prefer. For accompanying vegetables, I usually steam asparagus, broccoli or spinach. Nutritional Facts Per serving: 514 calories 38g protein 82g carbohydrates 4g fat Sweet Potato and Green Bean Salad Serves 6 Ingredients 1 lb. green beans (both ends removed, cut into pieces about 2 inches long) 1 lb. sweet potatoes (peeled and cut into 1-inch cubes) 1 cup [pineapple](/diet-nutrition/8-reasons-eat-pineapple/) juice 1/4 cup maple syrup 2 tablespoons olive oil Zest from 1 lemon (washed, to yield about 2 tsp) 1/4 teaspoon ground cumin 2 bay leaves 2 tablespoons soy sauce 1 teaspoon sesame seeds 3 cups baby arugula or watercress Preparation 1. Place the green beans in boiling salted water and cook until al dente. Remove and place in ice-cold water. Drain.2. Place the pineapple juice, cumin and bay leaves in a small saucepan. Simmer on low heat and reduce by half.3. In a bowl, mix the maple syrup, pineapple juice reduction, and soy sauce.4. Place the olive oil in a pan over high heat, add the sweet potatoes, and cook until golden brown on all sides.5. Place the sweet potatoes in a bowl and add the green beans, lemon zest, and the maple and pineapple dressing. Toss until mixed.6. Place the arugula (or watercress) on the bottom of a plate and the vegetables on top. Sprinkle with the toasted sesame seeds.7. Serve immediately. Notes: It is important to chill the green beans in ice-cold water immediately after cooking or they will lose their bright green color. Mixing the dressing with the sweet potatoes while they are still warm allows even distribution of the dressing throughout the salad. The salad should be served at room temperature. If potatoes are too warm, the watercress will wilt. Nutrition Facts Per serving: 253 calories 3g protein 39g carbohydrates 10g fat OMG (Oh My God) Banana Oatmeal Pancakes Serves 4 Ingredients 2 tablespoons light-brown sugar 1/2 cup oat flour 1/2 cup all-purpose flour 1 teaspoon baking powder 1/2 teaspoon salt 1/8 teaspoon nutmeg 2 large eggs 3 bananas, blended or food-processed 2 tablespoons (1 oz.) nonfat sour cream or buttermilk Milk (to consistency) 1 tablespoon butter (for cooking) Maple syrup, as desired Preparation 1. Mix light-brown sugar, oat flour, all-purpose flour, baking powder, salt and nutmeg together in a bowl.2. Whisk in sour cream or buttermilk, eggs and bananas.3. If the mixture is too thick, add milk a few tablespoons at a time.4. Preheat a nonstick pan over low to medium heat. Wipe a paper towel that has been rubbed with butter on the pan's bottom. (Remove excess butter with the same paper towel and use again before cooking next pancake.)5. With a ladle, pour some batter into the pan.6. Flip pancake when underside is golden brown; cook until no longer wet inside.7. Keep all pancakes warm until ready.8. Serve with maple syrup; can be topped with diced apples. Notes: I like to use Canadian D-grade maple syrup (equivalent of grade C in the U.S.) for its darker color and stronger flavor. Cooking in a non-stick pan allows you to use butter sparingly. You can make your own oat flour by blending rolled oats in a food processor or blender until fine. If you make the batter the night before, don't add the baking powder until just before cooking. This batter will be slightly darker, but the result will be just as delicious. Adding a tiny bit of diced mango to the batter just before cooking gives these pancakes a great flavor and pleasing color.
