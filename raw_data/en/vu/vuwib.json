It is defined as a chronic and recurrent abdominal pain, associated with defecation or changes in the stool form or frequency [ [2](#B2-nrp-15-411)]. It is a functional disorder because it is diagnosed when any detectable organic disease that may explain the symptoms is absent. It is classified into diarrhea-predominant, IBS-D; constipation-predominant, IBS-C; mixed type of diarrhea and constipation, IBS-M; or unclassified, IBS-U; according to the characteristics of the predominant symptoms [ [3](#B3-nrp-15-411)]. Many underlying pathophysiologic factors have been proposed, including altered GI motility, visceral hypersensitivity, abnormal gas propulsion and expulsion, infection, low-grade mucosal inflammation, intestinal permeability change, neuroendocrine abnormalities, immunologic psychologic factors, and genetic factors. However, the exact etiology of IBS has not been fully elucidated [ [2](#B2-nrp-15-411)]. [4](#B4-nrp-15-411) [5](#B5-nrp-15-411)]. Rifaximin, a poorly absorbable antibiotic, may contribute to inducing microbial homeostasis in the intestine, along with its major effects on the bactericidal/bacteriostatic activity and anti-inflammatory effects on the intestinal mucosa [ [6](#B6-nrp-15-411)]. A fecal microbiota transplantation study involving IBS subjects and healthy donors, who significantly differed in the bacterial strains before transplantation, showed that the transplantation was associated with changes in gut microbiota along with improvement in the symptoms and quality of life, which lasted up to 4 weeks [ [7](#B7-nrp-15-411)]. INTESTIANL PHYSIOLOGY UNDERLYING THE ROLE OF GUT MICROBIOTA IN IBS [8](#B8-nrp-15-411) [9](#B9-nrp-15-411) [10](#B10-nrp-15-411)]. Intestinal cell functions [Table 1](#T1-nrp-15-411)). GI tract cells play a distinctive role in food digestion, nutrient absorption and GI motility. Furthermore, GI tract cells contribute to various immune responses, including the mucosal barrier, in addition to producing hormones and neurotransmitters. Enterocytes are the major cells specialized in nutrient absorption, but also function as activators of the innate and adaptive immune system, which sense pathogens and release antimicrobial substances. M cells are antigen delivery cells, and dendritic cells are involved in phagocytosis and antigen presentation [ [11](#B11-nrp-15-411) [12](#B12-nrp-15-411)]. Paneth cells secrete antibacterial mediators and growth factors, thereby maintaining the stem cell repertoire that lines the crypt walls [ [13](#B13-nrp-15-411)]. Goblet cells, whose primary function is mucus production, line between the layers of enterocytes\u2014a loosely adherent layer and another layer firmly attached to the mucosa. The latter layer is free of bacteria [ [14](#B14-nrp-15-411)]. Through these multiple functions performed by the different cells, the intestinal epithelium maintains the structural integrity of the gut mucosal barrier against the penetration of microbes and enhances immune function [ [15](#B15-nrp-15-411)]. GI motility is a consequence of the coordination of neural and smooth muscle cells and interstitial cells of Cajal [ [16](#B16-nrp-15-411)]. Enteroendocrine cells also contribute to motor function by secreting hormones [ [17](#B17-nrp-15-411)]. Thus, disturbances in normal intestinal cell functions may be associated with the pathogenesis of IBS, including impaired bowel motility, persistent low-grade mucosal inflammation and of homeostasis and acidic dendritic [Impaired and IBS [19](#B19-nrp-15-411)]. It is estimated that 150 to 400 species dwell in human intestine. Gut microbiota are composed of different bacteria species taxonomically classified by species, genus, family, order, class and phylum. Dominant phyla in the healthy adult population microbiota. The consists genera as Lactobacillus, Bacillus, Clostridium, Enterococcus, and Ruminococcus. The Bacteroidetes is composed as Bacteroides and Prevotella. The Actinobacteria phylum, which is relatively less abundant, is mainly represented by the Bifidobacterium genus [ [22](#B22-nrp-15-411)]. [23](#B23-nrp-15-411)]. The gut microbiota continues to change throughout the span of human life, and the composition and distribution of microbial species are affected by various external and internal individual diversity and richness of the intestinal bacterial phylotypes are different, they form functionally similar intestinal flora. It has been understood that these stable and balanced clusters of microorganisms are maintained in the GI tract and they competitively defend against the invasion of various pathogens. Table 2 | |[Internal factors Intestinal luminal pH] [ Life stage and lifestyle factors (exercise, smoking, stress, obesity, hygiene, and geography)] [ Intestinal luminal oxygen saturation] [ Infection and inflammation as well as medications for infection and inflammation such as antibiotics and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug] [ Mucus production] [ Laxatives that affect intestinal luminal pH such as lactulose] [ Remedies that directly modulate gut microbiota such as prebiotics and probiotics] [Digestion and food metabolites] [ Gastric acid] [ Diet such as FODMAP diet, metabolites from foods such as short-chain fatty acid, and food additives such as artificial sweetener] [ GI secretions] [ Medications that inhibit gastric acid secretion such as pump Medications affect GI motility such as prokinetics, laxatives, and opioid] [ Enteric nervous system] GUT-BRAIN AXIS (GBA) AND IBS [30](#B30-nrp-15-411)]. Over the past decade, accumulating evidence has indicated that dysregulation of the GBA, in which the microbiota plays a critical role, has been highlighted in the pathogenesis of IBS. The notion of the GBA is that there exists a crosstalk between the brain and the gut, thereby implying that the crosstalk shares the ability to affect their individual functioning [ [31](#B31-nrp-15-411)]. GBA is a bidirectional network which includes the central nervous system, the autonomic nervous system, the enteric nervous system, and the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis. It is mainly involved in the regulation of GI motility, secretion of digestive enzymes, and communication with other organs using various neurotransmitters such as acetylcholine, dopamine, and serotonin. Among the various systems involved, the enteric nervous system is the main network that not only regulates gut motility and secretion, but also is involved in the immune system and maintenance of intestinal homeostasis [ [32](#B32-nrp-15-411)]. Thus, proper functioning of the GBA is critical for the physiology of the digestive system, and the dysregulation of the GBA through interactions with gut microbiota has been suggested as an etiology of IBS. In fact, gut microbiota and its metabolites can affect GI motility, its alteration being a hallmark of IBS, by influencing pathways involving enteric neurons, neuroglia, or enteric muscular macrophages [ [33](#B33-nrp-15-411)]. Thus, dysbiosis, although reported only in a portion of the patients with IBS, might be a candidate causal mechanism underlying the altered GI motility in IBS. [34](#B34-nrp-15-411) [35](#B35-nrp-15-411) [36](#B36-nrp-15-411) [37](#B37-nrp-15-411)]. Tryptophan is an essential amino acid obtained from the diet and is an important precursor of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine [5-HT]). Although plasma tryptophan concentrations may not differ between patients with IBS and healthy controls [ [38](#B38-nrp-15-411)], it has been hypothesized that tryptophan is a key amino acid in IBS, because of the relative importance of 5-HT in functional GI disorders [ [38](#B38-nrp-15-411)]. Alterations in 5-HT homeostasis have been reported in IBS patients, which might be associated with dysmotility because the 5-HT mucosal content in IBS patients is lower than that in healthy individuals [ [39](#B39-nrp-15-411)]. The depletion of host tryptophan resulting from indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase activation or dietary restriction reduced the proliferation of Lactobacillus [ [40](#B40-nrp-15-411)], some of which are reported to be tryptophan-utilizing bacteria [ [34](#B34-nrp-15-411) [41](#B41-nrp-15-411) [42](#B42-nrp-15-411)]. Restoration of tryptophan levels selectively induced the expansion of Lactobacillus [ [40](#B40-nrp-15-411)]. It appears that impaired tryptophan metabolism, which can modulate the GBA, may potentially participate in the manifestation of IBS symptoms associated with both local and central nervous system. DYSBIOSIS IN IBS [43](#B43-nrp-15-411) [44](#B44-nrp-15-411)] ( [Fig. such as Methanobrevibacter smithii and Methanosphaera stadtmanae were reduced with increasing severity of symptoms in parallel with increased Bacteroides [ [46](#B46-nrp-15-411)]. In this study, dietary factors did not affect the gut microbial signature in severe IBS cases. Although it is still not clear whether IBS causes microbial changes or vice versa [ [47](#B47-nrp-15-411)], dysbiosis may disrupt the epithelial barrier function and elicit low-grade inflammation, which can be a cause of visceral pain. Dysbiosis is also expected to activate the cellular and mucosal immune system, possibly resulting in low-grade inflammation and a leaky gut. Furthermore, alterations in the enteric nervous system and changes in gut motility due to dysbiosis are also anticipated to cause visceral hypersensitivity and bowel habit changes [ [48](#B48-nrp-15-411)]. Regarding the expansion of potential pathogenic microbes, the family Enterobacteriaceae (phylum Proteobacteria), family Lactobacillaceae and genus Bacteroides (phylum Bacteroidetes) [ [49](#B49-nrp-15-411)] were demonstrated to be present in IBS. In addition, Enterobacteriaceae-containing pathogenic bacteria with a corresponding reduction in Lactobacillus can aggravate IBS symptoms by producing organic acids [ [50](#B50-nrp-15-411)], and Bacteroides can worsen the symptoms, especially in IBS-D patients by inducing low-grade mucosal inflammation [ [51](#B51-nrp-15-411) [52](#B52-nrp-15-411)]. Thus, one might speculate that a new strategy\u2014expansion of beneficial microbiota such as lactobacilli and bifidobacteria and reduction of those bacteria considered as harmful (Clostridium, Escherichia coli, Salmonella, Shigella and Pseudomonas), may alleviate IBS symptoms [ [53](#B53-nrp-15-411)]. Lastly, microbial diversity and distribution according to dietary patterns have been regarded to play a crucial role in IBS pathogenesis by modulating the gut microenvironment, including colonic fermentation, gut microbiome composition and gut immune system [ [54](#B54-nrp-15-411) [55](#B55-nrp-15-411) [56](#B56-nrp-15-411)]. In fact, diet can affect motility, permeability, visceral sensation, gut-brain interactions, immune regulation, and neuroendocrine function by interacting with the gut epithelium and microbiota [ [57](#B57-nrp-15-411)]. The dynamic and flexible components of the gut microbiota can be influenced by diet, thereby affecting the IBS manifestation [ [58](#B58-nrp-15-411) [59](#B59-nrp-15-411)]. DIETARY MODULATION FOR THE RELIF OF IBS SYMPTOMS [60](#B60-nrp-15-411) [61](#B61-nrp-15-411)]. Interestingly, the gut microbiota also uses dietary nutrients for their survival and growth. The ingested foods and their metabolites can alter the normal gut microbiota profile and colonic fermentation, resulting in the dysregulation of gut permeability, motility and visceral hypersensitivity in IBS [ [56](#B56-nrp-15-411)]. [62](#B62-nrp-15-411)]. The effect of increasing the beneficial and reducing the harmful microbiota through dietary modification has been reproduced in several studies [ [63](#B63-nrp-15-411) [64](#B64-nrp-15-411) [65](#B65-nrp-15-411) [66](#B66-nrp-15-411) [67](#B67-nrp-15-411)]. Thus, a diet that limits the intake of \"offending\" foods that trigger these alterations, or a diet that corrects the microbiota dysbiosis, would be useful to manage IBS symptoms ( [Table 3](#T3-nrp-15-411)). These dietary benefits have been largely attributed to reduction in the levels of colonic fermentation or decreased antigen activation of the gut immune system. It is important to consider that diet significantly affects the composition of the gut microbiome [ [52](#B52-nrp-15-411) [55](#B55-nrp-15-411)]. Additional prebiotics, which are food compounds that can feed the microbiota such as fructo-oligosaccharides and galacto-oligosaccharides, and/or probiotics, which are useful live microorganisms such as Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium, may provide further beneficial effects to induce microbial homeostasis and improve symptoms [ of microbiota-accessible carbohydrates that increases the gut microbiota diversity and produces beneficial metabolites such as short-chain fatty acid.] [Soluble fibers relive symptoms by softening the stool. High fiber diet has been a standard care [Improves overall IBS symptoms such as vegetarians.] [Alleviates chronic low-grade mucosal inflammation, which helps enterocyte inflammation.] and Faecilibacterium.] High fiber diet [69](#B69-nrp-15-411)], and are fermented by enteric bacteria in the colon to produce short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and gases [ [70](#B70-nrp-15-411)]. The primary SCFAs produced in the gut are acetate, propionate, and butyrate [ [71](#B71-nrp-15-411)]. SCFAs and other metabolites are thought to mediate beneficial effects, including the preservation of gut epithelial integrity, energy homeostasis, and inflammatory signal inhibition and immunity [ [72](#B72-nrp-15-411)]. Unfortunately, to date, it is not yet clear whether SCFAs and their metabolites may conduct the beneficial effects on IBS through the modulation of gut microbiota environment [ [73](#B73-nrp-15-411) [74](#B74-nrp-15-411)]. [75](#B75-nrp-15-411)]. Insoluble fiber is found in foods, including wheat bran, vegetables, and whole grains but is not directly effective for relieving symptoms. Although insoluble fibers are generally poorly fermented by gut microbes, their presence in the diet increases the gut transit rate and thus reduces the time for colonic bacterial fermentation of non-digested foods [ [64](#B64-nrp-15-411)]. Although debatable, the standard care for IBS has been a high-fiber diet, particularly in IBS-C patients, given the absence of serious side effects and its potential benefit on gut microbiota [ [76](#B76-nrp-15-411)]. In IBS-C, fiber also has the effect of softening the stool, although it does not alleviate the pain. In a clinical setting, fiber supplements are hence recommended to begin at a low dose and increase slowly because fiber can aggravate IBS symptoms such as bloating, gas, and pain. Low such as acetate, propionate, and butyrate and variable amounts of hydrogen and carbon dioxide [ [77](#B77-nrp-15-411)]. These metabolites may alter the colonic microbial environment and affect the IBS symptoms. For example, increased production of SCFAs may increase luminal acidity. In double-blind placebo-controlled trials, FODMAPs exacerbated IBS symptoms such as abdominal pain, bloating, increased flatulence, and changes in bowel habits [ [78](#B78-nrp-15-411) [79](#B79-nrp-15-411)]. Fructo-oligosaccharides primarily contribute to colonic distention via microbial fermentation and subsequent gas production [ [70](#B70-nrp-15-411)]. Furthermore, FODMAP-induced symptoms have been suggested to be associated with baseline visceral hypersensitivity in patients of low FODMAP dietary therapy reported that at least 50% of patients with IBS experienced symptomatic benefits [ [87](#B87-nrp-15-411)]. In a 9-week clinical trial, a low FODMAP diet not only alleviated IBS symptoms compared to maltodextrin (placebo) and FODMAP diet but also decreased serum levels of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, total SCFAs, fecal bacteria (Actinobacteria, Bifidobacterium, and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii) compared to the baseline levels, suggesting that a low FODMAP can induce changes in levels of inflammatory cytokines, SCFA and gut microbiota profile [ study] [Adults with IBS (Rome III) (n = 27) and healthy subjects (n = 6)] [Habitual diet vs. low FODMAP or Australian diet (control)] [3] [qPCR] [ Lower absolute abundance of total bacteria, bifidobacteria, F. prausnitzii, Clostridium Cluster IV in low FODMAP diet vs. habitual and Australian diet] [[] [63](#B63-nrp-15-411)] [ Lower relative abundance of bifidobacteria in low FODMAP diet vs. habitual and Australian diet] [ Decreased abundance of Clostridium cluster XIVa in low FODMAP vs. habitual and Australian diet] [RCT, unblind] [Adults with (Rome III) (n = 35)] [Low FODMAP diet (n= 19) vs. habitual diet (n = 22)] [4] [FISH] [Lower absolute and relative abundance habitual diet] [[] [92](#B92-nrp-15-411)] [RCT, IBS (Rome III) (n = 104)] [Sham diet (n = 53) vs. low FODMAP diet (n = 51) and co-administration of multistrain probiotics] [4] [qPCR and 16S rRNA Lower species in low FODMAP vs. sham diet] [[] [139](#B139-nrp-15-411)] [ Sham diet/placebo (n = 27)] [ No effect on microbial diversity in low FODMAP diet] [ Sham diet/probiotic (n = 26)] [ diet/placebo (n 27)] [RCT, single [Adults with IBS (Rome III) (n = 95)] [Sham diet (n = 48) vs. low FODMAP diet (n = 47) and co-administration of a probiotic] [4] [16S rRNA gene FODMAP vs. sham diet] [[] [140](#B140-nrp-15-411)] [ Sham diet/placebo (n = 24)] [ Lactobacillus and Streptococcus abundance after probiotic supplementation vs. placebo] [ Sham diet/probiotic = 24)] FODMAP diet/placebo (n 26)] [RCT, single (Rome III) (n = 40)] [Low FODMAP diet (n = 19) vs. high (n = 18)] [3] [16S rRNA gene sequencing] [ Increased richness and diversity of Acinetobacter in low FODMAP diet in all types of IBS] [[] [82](#B82-nrp-15-411)] [ Higher bacterial richness of Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, Clostridiales and increased diversity of Acinetobacter in low FODMAP diet in IBS-M and IBS-D] [ Decreased the relative abundance of bacteria involved in gas consumption in high FODMAP diet] [ Increased the family Bifidobacteriaceae and unclassified genera within the family Lachnospiraceae in high FODMAP diet] [Uncontrolled study, unblind] diet] [1] [454 pyrosequencing] [ diversity after low FODMAP diet] [[] [94](#B94-nrp-15-411)] [ Trend for higher Bacteroidetes in low FODMAP vs. habitual] [91](#B91-nrp-15-411)]. Some studies have shown that a low FODMAP diet reduced Bifidobactrium [ [92](#B92-nrp-15-411) [93](#B93-nrp-15-411)], which has been regarded as a worse symptom profile, suggesting the supplementation of bifidobacteria-containing probiotics, which has been reported to reduce IBS symptoms, to the low FODMAP diet [ [93](#B93-nrp-15-411)]. In a human study that compared the microbial effects between low and high FODMAP diets, low FODMAP diet increased the richness and diversity of Actinobacteria, unlike the studies that showed a reduction in bifidobacteria with a low FODMAP diet, and a high FODMAP diet decreased the relative abundance of bacteria involved in gas consumption [ [82](#B82-nrp-15-411)]. A series of studies investigating the effect of low FODMAP on gut microbiota and its metabolites have shown mixed and sometimes conflicting results in contrast to the symptomatic improvement by low FODMAP [ [63](#B63-nrp-15-411) [94](#B94-nrp-15-411)]. The conflicting results are probably due to the study design including different subjects, study durations and/or different control diets, heterogeneity of low FODMAP diet, and methods to measure gut microbiota. It appears that the effect of low FODMAP through low luminal osmolality, reduced gas production, and GI motility may overcome the adverse microbial effects or the microbial changes caused by the low FODMAP diet, hence having minimal or no effect on IBS symptoms. However, a simple analysis of feces cannot reliably reveal the actual GI tract picture. Other approaches, such as metagenomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics, can provide information that is more reliable. If a low FODMAP diet does adversely affects the gut microbiota profile in IBS and is associated with worsening IBS, we need to determine a way to deal with these adverse effects, such as supplementation with probiotics or modulation of ingredient composition of the low FODMAP diet. In an interesting study using metagenomic sequencing in children with IBS [ [95](#B95-nrp-15-411)]; at the baseline non-responders were enriched with the genus Turicibacter from the family Turicibacteraceae. This suggests that the profile of microbiome before starting a low FODMAP diet can be useful to predict responders and non-responders. [96](#B96-nrp-15-411)]. Further studies focusing on the long-term effects of a low FODMAP diet on the clinical outcomes and dynamics of gut microbiota composition in patients with IBS are warranted. Low inflammatory diet [97](#B97-nrp-15-411) [98](#B98-nrp-15-411) [99](#B99-nrp-15-411)]. In severe IBS, lymphocytic infiltration in the myenteric plexus and inflammatory cell intrusion into the muscularis externa was shown to even lead to motor dysfunction of the GI tract [ [100](#B100-nrp-15-411)]. Individuals with IBS have been shown to have a high incidence of low-grade systemic inflammation [ [101](#B101-nrp-15-411)]. Thus, alleviating chronic, low-grade mucosal inflammation through diet, especially with an anti-inflammatory diet, may be an effective therapeutic strategy through enterocyte healing and nutritional support to the microbial environment [ [102](#B102-nrp-15-411)]. [103](#B103-nrp-15-411)]. The Western diet, which is high in saturated fat and simple carbohydrates, is a representative pro-inflammatory diet and known to be associated with the increased risk of IBS [ [104](#B104-nrp-15-411) [105](#B105-nrp-15-411)], whereas the Mediterranean diet (MD), which is high in high-fiber whole grains, nuts, legumes, fruits, vegetables and fish, has been regarded as a low inflammatory diet [ [106](#B106-nrp-15-411) [107](#B107-nrp-15-411) [108](#B108-nrp-15-411)]. In MD, the inclusion of saturated fat is limited, and the majority in the dietary fat content is monounsaturated fats (olive oil) and omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (fish). Extra virgin olive oil, a major constituent of the MD and enriched with oleic acid and polyphenols, has a major beneficial role in exerting antioxidant activity, thereby positively affecting several biomarkers of [109](#B109-nrp-15-411) [110](#B110-nrp-15-411) [111](#B111-nrp-15-411) [112](#B112-nrp-15-411) [113](#B113-nrp-15-411)]. These polyphenols are directly absorbed or metabolized in the intestine and transformed into active metabolites, where they may bring about a significant local effect through their interaction with the gut microbiota, which in-turn increases the levels of Bacteroidetes and reduces the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio [ [114](#B114-nrp-15-411)]. They potentially modulate the oxidative status of the intestinal barrier, inflammation, and immune response of the host [ [113](#B113-nrp-15-411)]. High nut consumption is a characteristic of MD. Walnuts, almonds, and many other nuts have been demonstrated to have a protective role against inflammation [ [115](#B115-nrp-15-411)], suggesting that nuts are a component causing the anti-inflammatory effect of MD [ [116](#B116-nrp-15-411)]. Furthermore, the daily intake of walnuts significantly affects the gut microbiome by increasing probiotic- and butyric acid-producing species [ [117](#B117-nrp-15-411)]. Although few studies have suggested symptomatic improvement of IBS by MD [ [118](#B118-nrp-15-411)], it could be worthwhile to study the effects of MD on IBS due to its anti-inflammatory effects and beneficial microbial effects. [119](#B119-nrp-15-411)]. Interestingly, the host blood vitamin levels are associated with IBS symptoms. The level of serum vitamin D, which is known to be associated with immune function and inflammation, tended to be lower in patients with IBS [ [120](#B120-nrp-15-411)]. Moreover, low vitamin D status correlated with severe symptoms in patients with IBS. In a recent report, the severity of symptoms significantly decreased after vitamin D3 supplementation in IBS-D patients with low vitamin D status as compared to the control group [ [121](#B121-nrp-15-411) [122](#B122-nrp-15-411) [123](#B123-nrp-15-411) [124](#B124-nrp-15-411)]. It is well known that low vitamin B-6 status is linked to inflammatory conditions, and interestingly, low intake of vitamin B-6 was correlated with a high IBS symptom score [ [125](#B125-nrp-15-411)]. However, there is no evidence that supplementation with these vitamins can actually improve IBS symptoms. [126](#B126-nrp-15-411)]. Another report showed that a more pro-inflammatory diet was associated with certain microbes, such as Ruminococcus torques, Eubacterium nodatum and Acidaminococcus intestine [ [127](#B127-nrp-15-411)]. In a recent report, the Bacteroidetes phylum was more abundant in vegans and vegetarians than in omnivores, and high consumption of vegetables consistent with an MD is more associated with beneficial microbiome-related metabolomic profiles compared to individuals consuming a Western diet [ [128](#B128-nrp-15-411)]. Further randomized controlled trials may provide more insight into the beneficial effect of a low inflammatory diet on the gut microbiota and subsequent improvement of IBS symptoms. Low fat diet [129](#B129-nrp-15-411)]. [130](#B130-nrp-15-411)]. Compared to low-fat diets, high-fat diets have frequently been shown to increase the abundance of intestinal microbiota [ [131](#B131-nrp-15-411) [132](#B132-nrp-15-411)]. The different effects of plant- and animal-based fat sources on the gut microbiota have been examined. In a recent report, nuts and other plant-based fat sources such as avocados and olive oil increased the genera Bifidobacterium, Roseburia, and Faecilibacterium, all of which are reported to have beneficial metabolic effects [ [133](#B133-nrp-15-411)]. Similarly, different effects of saturated and unsaturated fats on intestinal microbiota have also been reported. In a mouse model, a diet enriched with coconut oil (high in saturated fat) induced a relatively increased abundance of Allobaculum, Anaerofustis, F16, Lactobacillus reuteri, and Deltaproteobacteria and a relatively lower abundance of Akkermansia muciniphila compared to diets enriched with soy oil (high in polyunsaturated fat) in the cecum bacterial community [ [134](#B134-nrp-15-411)]. Functionally, the genes of cecal microbiota of high-coconut oil-fed mice were predicted to deplete the pathways involved in fatty acid and amino acid metabolism. Polyunsaturated fatty acids and their metabolites can exhibit beneficial effects on intestinal inflammation, which has been suggested as a mechanism involved in IBS. Another study demonstrated that a high saturated fat diet increased the gram-negative intestinal microbiota and subsequently increased endotoxemia [ [135](#B135-nrp-15-411)]. Metabolic endotoxemia through the gut microbiota composition and altered intestinal permeability, along with a disturbed membrane barrier, may contribute to mucosal inflammation by saturated fat [ [136](#B136-nrp-15-411)]. Collectively, fats from plant-based sources such as nuts and dietary patterns rich in polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats such as soy oil and olive oil have been associated with increased bacterial diversity and beneficial butyrate-producing bacteria, and hence, a positive metabolic influence [ [133](#B133-nrp-15-411)]. Probiotic and prebiotic foods [137](#B137-nrp-15-411)]. Nevertheless, probiotics have been used to improve the overall abdominal symptoms and bloating. [137](#B137-nrp-15-411)]. Although prebiotics usually do not improve GI symptoms in patients with IBS, the severity of flatulence was improved by prebiotics at doses 6 g/d, while inulin-type fructo-oligosaccharides worsened flatulence, suggesting that variations in the type and dose of the prebiotics in the diet may affect the improvement or exacerbation of the "}
