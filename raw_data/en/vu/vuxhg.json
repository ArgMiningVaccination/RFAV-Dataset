The Master Cleanse gives you an opportunity to make a change in your diet by giving you a break from your normal habits. Stanley Burroughs emphasizes that in order to obtain lasting benefits from the Master Cleanse Lemonade Diet, following the cleanse a healthy diet should be maintained. Daily Instructions 1. Start each morning with a \"Salt Water Flush\" Add 2 level teaspoons of non-iodized sea salt to a full quart of lukewarm water. Drink the entire quart of salt and water first thing in the morning. NOTE: This must be taken on an empty stomach. Several eliminations will likely occur during the next hour. If elimination does not occur, increase the amount of salt slightly; if it is too forceful, reduce the salt-to-water ratio until the proper balance is found. 2. Drink 6 or more glasses of the Master Cleanse organic lemonade mixture throughout the day. Follow this recipe 1. 2 Tbsp organic lemon or lime juice 2. 2 Tbsp organic Maple Valley Syrup 3. 1/10 tsp cayenne pepper 4. 8 oz spring or purified water ** Drink 6 to 12 glasses per day ** If your goal is detoxification Follow the above recipe. If you are underweight and are worried about losing weight while detoxifying, increase the amount of syrup in the mixture. If your goal is weight loss In the past, it was recommended to use less maple syrup - as little as 1 Tbsp per 8 oz glass - to maximize weight loss on the lemonade cleanse. However, using more maple syrup provides sustaining energy that allows many individuals to maintain the cleanse. Thus, one may be more likely to meet weight loss goals using the same lemonade recipe that is recommended for detoxification, including 2 Tbsp of maple syrup per glass. Our Most Popular Cleanse Kits How to Prepare for the Master Cleanse Give your body a chance to prepare for the fast. Most experts suggest a period of four to five days before you begin the actual lemonade diet. Day 1 - Eliminate Unhealthy Foods. On the first day of easing in, begin to develop more awareness about the foods you choose and notice which are fresh and raw. Begin to focus on these types of food and eliminate all processed foods, meat, dairy, alcohol, caffeine, and sugar. Choose organic whole foods. Day 2 - Fruits and Vegetables On Day 2, completely eliminate all processed foods, meat, dairy, alcohol, caffeine, and processed sugars from your meals. Instead, opt for fresh, organic fruits and fresh, organic vegetables. Day 3 - Liquids Only Switch to a liquid diet to prepare your body and mind for the days ahead. If you have a juicer or blender, then make fresh vegetable and fruit smoothies and juices from organic produce. You can also make light vegetable soups and broths for this day. Day 4 - Orange Juice Only In The Master Cleanser, author Stanley Burroughs cautions readers to break their fast with a day of consuming only orange juice. Use this same strategy for the last day of the easing-in period. Drink several glasses of fresh-squeezed, organic orange juice during the day. If you feel hungry, you can add a tablespoon or two of maple syrup to the juice. Also, drink plenty of water. At night, in preparation for starting the lemonade diet, take the laxative tea. Day 5 - Start the Master Cleanse Lemonade Diet Now your body is more prepared for the cleanse! How to Ease off the Master Cleanse When you break a fast like the Master Cleanse, it is very important to slowly ease yourself back into your normal diet in order to avoid serious digestive problems. In The Master Cleanser, Stanley Burroughs recommends the following regimen at the end of your fast: Day 1 - Orange Juice Only Slowly drink several 8oz glasses of fresh-squeezed organic orange juice as desired during the day. The orange juice prepares the digestive system to properly digest and assimilate regular food. If there has been any digestive difficulty prior to and during the changeover, extra water may be taken with the orange juice. Day 2 - Orange Juice + Vegetable Soup Drink several 8oz glasses of fresh-squeezed organic orange juice during the day - with extra water if needed. Sometime during the afternoon, prepare an organic vegetable soup (no canned soup) as described below. Make enough for 2 meals. Have the soup for the evening meal using the broth mostly, although some of the vegetables may be eaten. Organic whole grain rye wafers may be eaten sparingly with the soup, but no bread or crackers. Store the remaining soup in the refrigerator. Day 3 - OJ, Soup, Veggies, Salad, Fruit Drink fresh-squeezed organic orange juice in the morning. At noon have some more of the organic vegetable soup. For the evening meal have whatever is desired in the form of organic vegetables, salads or fruit only. Do not eat meat, fish, eggs, bread, pastries, caffeinated tea or coffee, alcohol, sugar or milk. Day 4 - Back to Normal, Healthy Eating Normal eating may be resumed. However, if, after eating is resumed, digestive distress or gas occurs, it is suggested that the lemonade diet be continued for several more days until the system is ready for food.
