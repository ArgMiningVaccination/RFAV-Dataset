The Society for Integrative Oncology (SIO) The mission of the Society for Integrative Oncology is to advance evidence-based, comprehensive, integrative healthcare to improve the lives of people affected by cancer. The Fascia Research Society (FRS) The Fascia Research Society has been established to facilitate, encourage and support the dialogue and collaboration between clinicians, researchers and academicians, in order to further our understanding of the properties and function of fasciae. The Osher Center for Integrative Medicine The Osher Center for Integrative Medicine is organizing this conference as part of its mission to expand the scope of integrative medicine and address new ideas in basic and translational science inspired by alternative medicine concepts and practices. ~Speaker Biographies~ Gary Deng, MD, PhD Interim Chief, Integrative Medicine Service, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, NY Dr. Deng is Interim Chief of the Integrative Medicine Service and an Associate Member/Attending Physician at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York.

Ogden Professor, Institute of Molecular Engineering, University of Chicago, IL Melody A. Swartz is the William B. Ogden Professor in the Institute of Molecular Engineering at the University of Chicago. She holds a BS from the Johns Hopkins University and a PhD in Chemical Engineering from MIT under the guidance of Dr. Rakesh Jain at Harvard. She undertook postdoctoral studies at Harvard Medical School with Jeffrey Drazen and Roger Kamm before starting her independent career as an Assistant Professor in Biomedical Engineering and Chemical Engineering at Northwestern University. She then spent eleven years at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne, where she was a Professor of Bioengineering and later served as the Director of the Institute of Bioengineering, constituting ~25 professors across two schools (Life Sciences and Engineering).Trained as a bioengineer, she uses quantitative approaches in cell biology and physiology, including biotransport and biomechanics, to investigate the role of the lymphatic system in immunity and pathophysiology, especially in cancer metastasis. She is particularly interested in the role of the lymphatic drainage in maintaining immunological tolerance in homeostasis, and the role of lymphangiogenesis in controlling inflammation as well as inducing pathological tolerance in cancer. Her lab applies this knowledge to develop novel immunotherapeutic approaches in cancer, including lymph node-targeting vaccine approaches.Her awards include the Rita Schaffer Award from BMES, an NSF CAREER award, the Arnold & Mabel Beckman Young Investigator Award, and the Wenner Prize from the Swiss Cancer League. In 2012 she was named a MacArthur Foundation Fellow, an honor that recognizes exceptional creativity in any field.

Beverley de Valois, PhD Research Acupuncturist, Mount Vernon Cancer Center, UK Beverley de Valois is a Research Acupuncturist at the Lynda Jackson Macmillan Centre, a cancer-information and drop-in centre at Mount Vernon Cancer Centre in the United Kingdom. In 2007, she was awarded a PhD by the University of West London for her research into using acupuncture to manage side-effects experienced by women with breast cancer receiving adjuvant hormonal therapies. Post- doctoral funding from the UK's National Institute of Health Research facilitated exploratory research into using acupuncture in the management of cancer-treatment-related upper body lymphoedema. She has followed this with pilot work investigating using acupuncture in the management of cancer and non-cancer related lower limb lymphoedema. Her main interests are using acupuncture to improve quality of life for cancer survivors and for people with lymphoedema, and women's health. She practices privately at her clinic, the Women's Clinic @ Uxbridge. In 2011 Dr. de Valois was nominated a Fellow of the British Acupuncture Council. She is an Honorary Research Fellow at the University of Bristol. Suzanna Zick, ND, MPH Research Associate Professor, Department of Family Medicine, University of Michigan Health System, MI Suzanna Zick is a Research Associate Professor in Family Medicine and a Research Associate Professor of Environmental Health Sciences in the School of Public Health at the University of Michigan. Dr. Zick received her degree as a naturopathic physician from the National College of Naturopathic Medicine in Portland, Oregon and her MPH in Epidemiology from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. Dr. Zick's research interests include the effect of natural products for cancer prevention; the use of complementary therapies for control of cancer-related symptoms; and the impact of diet and various complementary therapies on fatigue, sleep disturbance and quality of life during cancer survivorship. Her work has mainly focused on pharmacokinetic and interventional clinical trials. Along with examining the effect of ginger root as a potential cancer prevention agent for colorectal cancer, she has also examined the impact of ginger for chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, and investigated if an herbal blend \"Essiac\" improves quality of life in a cohort of Canadian breast cancer survivors. More recently, she has been examining the effect of self-administered acupressure for improving fatigue and sleep disruption in breast cancer survivors. She has also been conducting a study looking into the interrelationship between fatigue, inflammatory cytokines and the brain neurotransmitters creatine, glutamate and gaba-aminobutyric acid (GABA). ~Exhibitors~ Exhibitors are on the Ground Floor (Lobby Area) & First F loor ( Elements Caf\u00e9) American Academy of Medical Acupuncture (AAMA) American Cancer Society American College of Traditional Chinese Medicine (ACTCM) / Tong Ren Tang Anti Cancer Lifestyle Foundation Ayush Herbs Inc.
