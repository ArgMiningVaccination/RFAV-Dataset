Aromatherapy is the practice of using natural oils to enhance psychological and physical well-being. Each oil is of a natural compound which is found in the seeds, stems, bark, roots, flowers and other parts of plants. If you have enjoyed the smell of lavender, a rose or freshly cut mint, then you have experienced the aromatic qualities of essential oils. As a patient enters the door of the Integrative Therapies Suite, they are happily greeted by our scheduler and with sounds of soft music coming from each of the therapy rooms. At that time, they take a moment to discover which essential oil feels good to them as they inhale its essence. Patients are then given their own personal inhaler to use during their massage, reiki or acupuncture session and also to take with them as a gift to use to calm or enhance their day. Oncology Massage Massage therapy at the Cancer Center is provided by an oncology-trained massage therapist. Massage is offered in the infusion room during your treatment or by appointment. This massage is a therapeutic and safe massage for patients going through cancer treatment. Benefits of massage may include deep relaxation, decrease in muscular tension, pain and anxiety. "}
