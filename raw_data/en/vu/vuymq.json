It uses food, spices, herbal remedies, bodywork and lifestyle changes to boost your health and balance the body, mind and spirit. Intrigued? In her new book, [The Ayurvedic Self-Care Handbook](https://www.amazon.com/Ayurvedic-Self-Care-Handbook-Holistic-Healing/dp/1615195432), licensed chiropractor, certified Ayurvedic practitioner and yoga teacher Sarah Kucera outlines how to incorporate Ayurveda into your life. Here, her Ayurvedic morning routine that will refresh and restore you for the day ahead. Rise before (or with) the sun We're talking between 5 a.m. and 7 a.m., people. \"[This] is considered to be the most auspicious time of day, making it the best time for meditation, taking in knowledge, or self-study,\" writes Kucera. She also acknowledges that this might not be the easiest ritual to get onboard with and maybe not the one to tackle first. Our advice? Baby steps\u2014start by getting up just 20 minutes earlier than usual and take it from there. Meditate \"Whether you call it prayer, meditation or mental hygiene, mindful stillness comes to us most easily in the early morning.\" Why? Because your brain hasn't had the opportunity to start overthinking yet or get distracted by everything on your never-ending to-do list. Don't worry too much about where or how you meditate, advises Kucera. Even sitting up in bed with your eyes closed for a few minutes is beneficial. Clean your tongue It sounds weird, but [tongue scraping](https://www.purewow.com/wellness/tongue-scraping-benefits) is surprisingly relaxing. To do it the Ayurvedic way, first examine the coating. Depending on what's there, it could be telling you something about your digestive health. A yellow color indicates that your digestive fire is too hot, for example, and you should reduce spicy, sour and salty foods. Then, use a tongue cleaner to clear off layers of toxins that have accumulated overnight. "}
