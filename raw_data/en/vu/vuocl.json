E-mail: jastin@cooper.cpmc.org Submitted November 4, 2002; revision accepted February 13, 2003.Fibromyalgia syndrome (FM) is characterized by chronic widespread musculoskeletal pain and multiple tenderpoints 1. In studies performed in the general population, prevalence ranges between 0.5% and 5%, with womenshowing significantly greater prevalence than men 2. Patients with FM frequently present with multiple symptomsincluding depression, sleep disturbance, and fatigue, withresulting high disability and disruption in social and workroles as well as extensive use of medical services. Causes of FM remain poorly understood, with treatment typically focused almost exclusively on symptom manage-ment 3-6. Common therapeutic approaches include use of antidepressants (tricyclics and selective serotonin reuptakeinhibitors) 7, as well as selected pain and sleep medications. There are significant side effects associated with a numberof these pharmacological approaches, however, and the ther-apeutic benefits tend to be small and relatively shortlived 5,8. Patient dissatisfaction with conventional pharmacologic andbiomedical approaches to FM has also been suggested asone factor underlying the relatively high rates of use ofcomplementary/alternative therapies by this population 9-12. There is some evidence from 2 recent systematic reviews tosuggest that 2 forms of these complementary/alternativetherapies \u2014 aerobic exercise and an array of psycholog-ical/\"mind-body\" therapies (e.g., biofeedback, relaxation,cognitive-behavioral therapy) \u2014 may be effective adjunctsto pharmacologic treatment, particularly in terms of helpingfoster a greater sense of control and self-efficacy to meet thechallenges of FM 13,14. Results of a pilot study (n = 28) of an 8 week interven- tion in FM patients focusing on the practice of mindfulnessmeditation and Qigong movement therapy (describedbelow) showed significant reductions in pain, fatigue, sleepdisturbance, and depression, as well as reductions in tenderpoint scores that persisted through 24 weeks 15. However,The Efficacy of Mindfulness Meditation Plus Qigong Movement Therapy in the Treatment of Fibromyalgia:A Randomized Controlled Trial JOHN A. ASTIN, BRIAN M. BERMAN, BARKER BAUSELL, WEN-LIN LEE, MARC HOCHBERG, and KELLY L. FORYS ABSTRACT. Objective. To test the short and longterm benefits of an 8 week mind-body intervention that combined training in mindfulness meditation with Qigong movement therapy for individuals with fibromyalgia syndrome (FM).Methods. A total of 128 individuals with FM were randomly assigned to the mind-body training program or an education support group that served as the control. Outcome measures were pain,disability (Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire), depression, myalgic score (number and severity oftender points), 6 minute walk time, and coping strategies, which were assessed at baseline and at 8,16, and 24 weeks.Results. Both groups registered statistically significant improvements across time for the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire, Total Myalgic Score, Pain, and Depression, and no improve-ment in the number of feet traversed in the 6 minute walk. However, there was no difference in eitherthe rate or magnitude of these changes between the mind-body training group and the educationcontrol group. Salutary changes occurring by the eighth week (which corresponded to the end of themind-body and education control group sessions) were largely maintained by both groupsthroughout the 6 month followup period.Conclusion. While both groups showed improvement on a number of outcome variables, there was no evidence that the multimodal mind-body intervention for FM was superior to education andsupport as a treatment option. Additional randomized controlled trials are needed before interven-tions of this kind can be recommended for treatment of FM.

Based on these promising preliminary findings, a randomized trial was conducted to further examine the shortand longterm effects of an integrated program of stressreduction based on training in mindfulness meditation andthe Chinese movement therapy, Qigong. Mindfulness wasoriginally selected as a primary component of this multi-modal intervention based on studies by Kabat-Zinn, et al suggesting the potential efficacy of this form of meditationin treating chronic pain conditions in general 16,17and FM specifically18. Research suggesting that physical exercise may be particularly beneficial in FM when combined withmind-body/psychosocial approaches 13led naturally to the inclusion of Qigong into the intervention, based upon itsgentle movements and its purported capacity to increaseenergy levels in practitioners, all of which were hypothe-sized to be a potentially effective approach with FMpatients. MATERIALS AND METHODS To control for group and facilitator attention (as well as standard threats to internal validity such as regression to the mean and natural history of thedisease), we randomized subjects to the mind-body treatment or the educa-tion/support control group. Individuals with a diagnosis of FM wererecruited by radio/newspaper advertising and through networking withlocal physicians. Criteria for study inclusion were: (1) Clinical diagnosis ofFM by patient's own health care provider. (2) Fulfillment of AmericanCollege of Rheumatology (ACR) classification criteria for FM verified byrheumatologic examination: (a) widespread pain (axial plus upper andlower segment plus left and right side pain for 3 mo; (b) tenderness at 11 of the 18 specific tender point sites. (3) Age between 18 and 70 years.(4) Able to read and speak English fluently. (5) Able to attend group inter-vention session if assigned to that group. (6) Able to give informed consent. Exclusion criteria included pregnancy, substance abuse, major psychi- atric disorder (that would prevent compliance), involvement in impending litigation or judgment for disability workers' compensation, or uncontrolledhypertension, diabetes, congestive heart failure or other severe chronicmedical conditions judged by the clinician to place the patient at risk ofpossible severe consequences of his/her disease. Patients were not excludedfor the presence of concomitant rheumatic disease. Recruitment was carried out by Integrative Medical Research (IMR) under the direction of staff at the Complementary Medicine Program,University of Maryland School of Medicine. Initial eligibility was deter-mined by telephone screening of all interested subjects. Clinic appoint-ments at IMR were subsequently scheduled for all eligible participants.With written informed consent (approved by the Human Subjects SafetyCommittee of the University of Maryland), a semistructured clinical inter-view was carried out by an IMR staff physician to determine ACR criteriafor FM 1and to verify eligibility. Subjects meeting these criteria were then seen by a research assistant who administered the series of self-reportmeasures (see below) and a 6 minute walk time test. Power calculations were carried out based upon baseline-to-end of treatment changes in the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire in our earlier pilot study. However, owing to the relatively high attrition rate, werecruited an additional 18 subjects to arrive at our final sample size of128. This sample size produced an estimated power level of slightly morethan 80% for the effect size obtained in the original pilot study for the 8week assessment, and power equal to 75% for the final 24 week assess-ment.Primary outcome measures.Tender point count: the total number of times a patient verbally indicates \"ithurts\" during palpation of the 18 tender point sites recognized by the ACRto be one criterion for classification of FM 1. Total myalgic score: obtained by summing tenderness scores for each of the18 tender points as defined by ACR criteria for FM. The score for each sitecan range from 0 to 3, for an overall score range of 0-54 (higher scoresindicating more pain). FM Impact Questionnaire (pain and functioning): a 10 item validateddisease-specific scale that assesses physical functioning, pain, depression,anxiety, fatigue, morning tiredness, stiffness, job difficulty, and overall wellbeing, with confirmed reliability and validity 19. Pain: from the appropriate subscale of the Medical Outcome Study Short-form-36 (SF-36).Six minute walk time test (objective measure of function): subjects areasked to walk as far and as quickly as possible within 6 minutes. A measureof performance recorded in number of feet covered.Beck Depression Inventory: a 21 item questionnaire that is well establishedand validated in assessing depression 20. Medical care history: an interview-administered questionnaire regardingoutpatient visits, inpatient care, use of prescription and over the counter(OTC) drugs, and use of complementary/alternative therapies. With regardto clinical encounters, detailed questions are asked about the reason for thevisit, the physician who was seen, and whether any specific medical proce-dures were completed. At baseline, patients were asked about the previous6 months. At followup visits, patients were questioned about the time sincetheir previous visit. Secondary outcomes. Coping Strategies Questionnaire: a 50 item validated instrument with 8subscales that assess cognitive and behavioral pain coping mechanisms andstrategies 21. The mind-body intervention. The active treatment for this study consisted of 2 principal components, mindfulness meditation training and Qigong. The intervention was delivered through weekly group meetings (groupsizes ranged from 10 to 20 participants). Sessions were 2.5 hours long. Thefirst 90 minute period of each session was based closely on the mindful-ness-based stress reduction program developed by Kabat-Zinn andcolleagues at the University of Massachusetts Medical Center 22. As with the original program, these group sessions were centered on the principlesand practice of mindfulness meditation, which involves the cultivation ofmoment-to-moment, nonjudgmental awareness of one's present-momentexperience. The goal of this practice is to cultivate a stable and nonreactiveawareness of one's internal (e.g., cognitive-affective-sensory) and external(social-environmental) experiences as contrasted with the tendency humanshave to react quite reflexively (habitually or automatically) to the myriadsituations and experiences (whether stressful or challenging, or not)encountered in daily life. Weekly didactic and experiential sessionsinvolved the learning of 2 formal meditation practices (a body scan andsitting meditation) along with discussions about the practical applica-tions of this type of mindful awareness for coping with pain, psycholog-ical distress, with the challenges of FM, and with stressful life events in general. In the last hour of each session, participants were introduced to the practice of Qigong. Qigong is an ancient Chinese health care system that integrates physical postures, breathing techniques, and focused intention.The word Qigong (Chi Kung) is made up of 2 Chinese words. \"Qi\"(pronounced chee) is usually translated to mean the life force or vital-energy that flows through all things in the universe. The second word,\"Gong\" (pronounced gung), means accomplishment, or skill that is culti-vated through steady practice. Together, Qigong means cultivating energy.It is a system practiced for health maintenance, healing, and increasingvitality. The Qigong was taught by a Chinese master of this discipline usinga specific form (\"Dance of the Phoenix\") that she developed in the pilotstudy specifically for patients with FM.

The control arm was described to potential participants as an \"education-support\" group. As with the mind- body intervention, group sessions were held once a week for 8 weeks andwere 2.5 hours long. The facilitator presented short lectures on a differenttopic each week (topics were drawn principally from the book Your personal guide to living well with fibromyalgia: A handbook for self-careand treatment 23, which is used as a text in the Arthritis Self-Help Course). Topics included stress, exercise, pain cycle/emotions, sleep, work, inti-macy, and review of current research. Following these presentations, therewas time for questions as well as more unstructured and open-endedsharing and discussion among group participants. Following completion of all diagnostic examinations and self-adminis- tered questionnaires, eligible patients were randomly assigned to one of the2 trial arms. Blocks of 2, 4, or 6 groups of patients were first randomlyselected with a computer program and then patients were randomlyassigned to blocks. A total of 128 patients were enrolled into the study in 4recruitment waves. Clinical staff at IMR were not given access to patients' group assign- ments at the baseline assessment, and remained blinded to the randomiza-tion scheme for the duration of the trial and all subsequent followup. Allbaseline assessments were repeated by IMR at the completion of the inter-vention (8 weeks), and at followup assessments at 16 and 24 weeks. Data analysis. While an intent-to-treat analysis was planned, compliance was not sufficient among individuals who dropped out of the study prior to the 8 week assessment to permit this, hence the analyses were performedonly upon individuals who completed the entire protocol. For each of the 5primary outcome variables, 2 (group: mind-body vs education control) \u00d74 (time: baseline and 8, 16, and 24 week assessments) analyses of variancewere performed, with the latter factor represented as a repeated measure. Inthis particular analysis, the 2 terms of interest were the time main effect(which indicated whether changes on an outcome variable occurred as afunction of time irrespective of the treatment received) and the time \u00d7 treat- ment interaction (which indicated whether subjects in one treatment groupchanged more than their counterparts in the other group over time). Thislatter term was employed to contrast the performance of the 2 groups, sinceit assessed whether (or not) subjects in the mind-body group improvedmore (or less) over time than those subjects in the education-control group.RESULTS As illustrated in Tables 1 and 2, the sample was primarilyfemale and Caucasian, and possessed multiple comorbidi-ties (the most common of which were depression, thyroidproblems, and hypertension). The average age of partici-pants was 47.7 (SD 10.6) years and over 80% had taken atleast some college courses. There were no statisticallysignificant differences between the mind-body and educa-tion-control groups with respect to baseline values for anyof the demographic, clinical, or outcome variables. Of 128 individuals randomized to the 2 groups, 50 (39%) withdrew prior to the 8 week (end of treatment) assessment,61 (48%) withdrew by week 16, and 63 (49%) failed tocomplete the 24 week assessment schedule. Overall, 25.8%of the sample never attended even one class (18.8% of themind-body group; 32.8% of the controls). Given this highattrition rate, we compared those individuals who chose towithdraw from the study to those who did not with respectto their baseline demographic, clinical, and outcome values.This analysis indicated that individuals who completed their8 week assessment schedule, compared to those whodropped out prior to this assessment, were slightly older(age 49 vs 45 yrs; p = 0.05). There were no statisticallysignificant differences on any of the other variables. As indicated in Table 3, both groups registered statisti- cally significant improvements across time for (a) the TotalFibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire [F = 15.0 (3, 189), p <0.001]; (b) the Total Myalgic Score [F = 4.7 (3, 156), p =0.004]; (c) Pain [F = 10.5 (3, 189), p < 0.001]; and (d)Depression [F = 17.0 (3, 186), p < 0.001]. There was noimprovement in the number of feet traversed in the 6 minute Astin, et al: Mind-body therapy for FM 2259Table 1. Demographic characteristics of the patients with FM (n = 128).

The only subscale of the Coping Strategies Questionnaire that showed a significant change over timewas \"catastrophizing.\" There were no statistically signifi-cant group by time interactions for any of the outcome vari-ables, indicating that, while both groups improved over timefor the majority of the variables, there was no difference ineither the rate or magnitude of these changes between themind-body and the education-control group. An examination of the pattern of means in Table 3 (illus- trated in Figure 1) indicates that the salutary changes occur-ring by the 8th week (which corresponded to the end of themind-body and education-control group sessions) werelargely maintained throughout the followup period. Within-group analyses were correspondingly performed individu-ally contrasting 8th, 16th, and 24th week assessments withbaseline values. As indicated in Table 3, both groupsimproved significantly at each of these assessment periodsfor the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire, pain, anddepression. Only the mind-body group improved signifi-cantly with respect to the Total Mylagic Score, however, andneither group improved with respect to performance on the6 minute walk. DISCUSSION Findings for the efficacy of a multimodal mind-body inter-vention combining mindfulness meditation and Qigongmovement therapy did not suggest that this treatmentmodality was superior to education and support in the treat-ment of FM. While participants who completed the study inthe mind-body group showed significant improvements inmost outcomes post-intervention and at 16 and 24 weekfollowup times, patients randomized to the education-support group showed comparable gains. As a result, therewere no significant between-group differences on any studyoutcome. Our finding of comparable improvements in both the mind-body and education-support control groups can beinterpreted in several ways. First, it could be argued thatbecause there were no significant between-group differ-ences, the positive changes observed in the meditation/Qigong group post-intervention and at followup were not afunction of the intervention per se but were the result ofsome placebo or expectancy effect (e.g., simply beingenrolled in the study produced an expectation of relief frompain, disability, etc.), regression to the mean, natural historyof the disease, or demand characteristics (e.g., attempting toplease the investigators). Since the positive changes werefor the most part maintained at 6 month followup,explaining the results in terms of natural history of thedisease seems less plausible, although our study designcannot definitively rule out this possibility, nor regression tothe mean. A second interpretation is that some aspect or aspects of the control group actually became therapeutic for partici- The Journal of Rheumatology 2003; 30:10 2260Table 2.

Based on our findings, it is notclear, however, whether the apparent changes were the resultof some shared or similar features in the 2 groups (e.g.,attention of facilitator, group emotional support) or theresult of particular components that were unique to each ofthe groups. The principal limitation of the study was the high attri- tion rate. While this higher than expected dropout rate mayhave introduced bias into the findings, our analysis failed toreveal any significant difference between completers anddropouts, with the exception of age, completers beingslightly older. However, as noted, the majority of those whofailed to complete the study never actually attended any ofthe sessions (i.e., dropped out after randomization but beforeparticipating in the group meetings). While this study provides no firm evidence for the effi- cacy of a mindfulness meditation/Qigong intervention forthe treatment of FM, the paucity of other viable treatmentoptions, the possibility that the educational-support controlwe employed may have itself had therapeutic properties, andthe statistically significant (if clinically small) improve-ments in both groups suggest the need for further, highquality randomized trials employing other nonpharmaco-logic interventions in the treatment of FM.REFERENCES 1.
