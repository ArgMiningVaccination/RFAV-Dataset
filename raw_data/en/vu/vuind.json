Sanguisorba officinalis (called DiYu in Chinese, DY) is well known as herbal medicine, which could inhibit the growth of pathogenic bacteria, hemostasis and regulate the immune response. Moreover, the active ingredients in DY could remarkably reduce drug resistance. In this study, we investigated the effects of probiotic fermentation cultures on A. hydrophila through in vitro and in vivo experiments. Three lactic acid bacteria, including Lactobacillus rhamnosus (LGG), Lactobacillus casei (LC) and Lactobacillus plantarum (LP), were selected to ferment the Chinese herbal medicine DY. The assays of antagonism showed that all three fermented cultures could influence the ability of A. hydrophila growth, among which L. rhamnosus fermented DY cultures appeared to be the strongest inhibitory effect. In addition, the biofilm determination revealed that L. rhamnosus fermented DY cultures could significantly inhibit the biofilm formation of A. hydrophila compared to the other groups. Furthermore, protease, lecithinase and urease activities were found in the three fermentation cultures. Three probiotics fermented DY cultures were orally administration with crucian carp to evaluate the growth performance, immunological parameters and pathogen resistance. The results showed that the three fermentation cultures could promote the growth performance of crucian carp, and the immunoglobulins, antioxidant-related enzymes and immune-related genes were significantly enhanced. Besides, the results showed that crucian carp received L. rhamnosus (60.87%), L. casei (56.09%) and L. plantarum (41.46%) fermented DY cultures had higher survival rates compared with the control group after infection with A. hydrophila. In conclusion, this study proved that the fermentation cultures of three probiotics could effectively inhibit the growth of A. hydrophila, regulate the level of immune response and improve the survival rate against A. hydrophila in crucian carp. The results would provide a theoretical basis for the development and application of novel antibiotic alternatives. Keywords: Aeromonas hydrophila, Sanguisorba Officinalis "}
