To do that, you really need to be taught by someone in person. Different people prefer to learn in different ways. Some may decide to take the plunge and experience one of our longer [Group Retreats](https://gaiahouse.co.uk/programme-2023/), for 4, 5 or even 7 days. Others may wish to begin with a Group Retreat weekend or a [Meditation Day](/retreats/group-retreat-programme/one-day-retreats/). Alternatively, work or family commitments mean that many people learn meditation by attending weekly classes locally or attending our [Online evenings, retreats and courses](https://gaiahouse.co.uk/online-offerings/). All of these different routes to learning work well in their own way. If you'd like to learn to meditate by attending weekly classes and live in South Devon, see details of [Evening Meditation Courses](/events-outside-gaia/) in Newton Abbot. [Sharpham Trust](https://www.sharphamtrust.org/), near Totnes, also run a regular programme of Insight Meditation and mindfulness evenings, weekend mornings and courses.

Elsewhere in the UK, try getting in touch with a local [Meditation Group](/local-meditation-groups/) (some overseas groups are also listed) or check here a [list of regional events](https://gaiahouse.co.uk/events-outside-gaia/regional-retreats/).

If you have learned to meditate in the context of Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) or Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR), [read about how Gaia House's offering differs from this](/about-meditation/insight-meditation-mbsr-mbct/). Learning meditation does not require you to identify yourself as a Buddhist, or to subscribe to the principles of Buddhism. All you need is an interest in inner exploration and development. Gaia House warmly welcomes all people of every age, ethnicity, cultural heritage and religious background, socio-economic group, ability, sexual orientation and gender identity. Gaia House is committed to supporting the physical, psychological, emotional and spiritual well-being of all who reside and work here. "}
