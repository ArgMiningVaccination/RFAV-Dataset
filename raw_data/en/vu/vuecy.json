Employees may seek a legal exception to the vaccination requirement due to a disability, using this template. DOE may also ask for other information, as needed. Requests for \"medical accommodation\" or \"medical exceptions\" will be treated as requests for a disability accommodation and evaluated and decided under applicable Rehabilitation Act standards for reasonabl e accommodation absent undue hardship to the agency. An employee may also request a delay for complying with the vaccination requirement based on certain medical considerations that may not justify an exception under the Rehabilitation Act.
