Chiropractic treatment is a non-medicinal and non-surgical healthcare procedure that works by bringing balance between your nervous and musculoskeletal systems. The chiropractic treatment is based on resetting the balance of muscles and relieving impinged nerves (a consequence of muscle imbalances). A chiropractor is like your body mechanic, setting your body parts back to alignment. A chiropractor does the following: - Chiropractic adjustment - Mobilization of joints - Relaxation exercises - Spinal manipulations What Happens During Spinal Manipulation Chiropractic adjustment or spinal manipulation is the go-to treatment modality of the chiropractor. This treatment is of the utmost benefit for patients suffering from accident-related injuries. Usually, a chiropractor identifies the region and the cause of the pain and subluxations. Then they start to manipulate your lumbar spine using their hands or specialized devices. The forces exerted by a chiro are localized, controlled, well-directed, and sudden. The chiropractic force is applied to the spinal joints, and you might feel a crack during the session followed by relaxation. Do chiropractors really help? Yes, a chiropractor manipulates the lumbar spine to cure subluxations of the spine. Misaligned vertebral bodies are the root cause of several aches and pains in the body. This misalignment can lead to impingement of nerves and muscle spasms in the upper and lower back region. Chiropractic adjustments can treat inflammation, muscle spasms, and realignment of the vertebrae. How long does it take for chiropractic adjustments to work? It depends upon the type and the severity of the disease. General spinal misalignments are corrected in a single visit, and you can feel relief instantly. 1st visits usually provide you 40-80% relief. In some cases, the effects show within 1-4 weeks (from the start of therapy). However, congenital disorders, old injuries, and chronic diseases may take longer to show effect, and may have to visit the facility 2-3 times a week for a couple of weeks. How does seeing a chiropractor help? The chiropractor not only manually resets your muscles and spine but also guides you into living a better life. In addition to the spinal manipulations and mobilization of the joints, a chiropractor helps you in the following ways: - Guide you on how to use heat and cold therapy for muscle soreness - Recommend you dry needling or other beneficial therapies - Suggest you different exercises and stretches for healthy living - Relaxation exercises and nutritional counseling are also among the teachings of a chiropractor What are the benefits of chiropractic procedures?

Yes, Chiropractors hold a Doctor of Chiropractic degree. They don't own a medical degree, so they are not medical doctors, but that doesn't mean that they are unauthorized to impart healthcare services. The four-year healthcare degree teaches them diagnostic care, and they also learn about neuromuscular systems and their anatomy in depth. They are entirely authorized to perform non-invasive and personalized care for all ages and genders. "}
