Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) rupture is one of the most common injuries in sports medicine.1ACL reconstructions are usually performed to restore the stability of the knee joint.2,3Hamstring tendons are commonly used in ACL reconstruction because of the low harvest site morbiditycompared with the patellar tendon. 4Reconstruction withhamstring initial xation.

The evidence considering tendon graft healing to bone in humans is limited in several case series or case reports, and therefore, it is dif cult to understand the healing process. A computerized search using relevant search terms was performed in the PubMed,EMBASE, Scopus, and Cochrane Library databases, as well as a manual search ofreference lists. Searches were limited to st udies that investigated tendon graft healing to bone by histologic examination after ante rior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction with hamstring. Ten studies were determined to be eligible for this systematic review.Thirty-seven cases were extracted from the included studies. Most studies showed that abrovascular interface would form at the tendon -bone interface at the early stage and a brous indirect interface with Sharpey-like bers would be expected at the later stage. Cartilage-like tissue at tendon graft -bone interface was reported in three studies. Tendon graft failed to integrate with the surrounding bone in 10 of the 37cases. Unexpectedly, suspensory type of xation was used for the above failure cases. An indirect type of insertion with Sharpey-like bers at tendon -bone interface could be expected after ACL reconstruction with hamstring. Regional cartilage-like tissue mayform at tendon -bone interface occasionally. The underlying tendon-to-bone healing process is far from understood in the human hamstring ACL reconstruction.

Published online: 2018-05-21grafts heal to bone and how to improve tendon-to-bone healing in the past decades.6-10 Conventional mechanical testing has been regarded as a gold standard for the evaluation of tendon graft healing in bone tunnel.11-13However, it is impossible to obtain enough human specimens for tensile testing to explore the tendon-to-bone healing process after ACL reconstruction with hamstring. Radiological evaluations are usuallyemployed to explore the tendon-to-bone healing process, while histological evaluations could provide a direct and microscopic understanding. Due to the invasive nature of thebiopsy procedure, most studies concerning to tendon healing and incorporation into bone are mainly based on animal studies. 6,10The evidence considering tendon graft healing to bone in humans is limited in several case series or case reports, and therefore, it is dif cult to understand the healing process. The objective of this study was to systematicallyreview the histological results of tendon healing in bone tunnel after human ACL reconstruction. Methods Search Strategy A systematic review of the literature was performed inaccordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systema- tic Reviews and Meta-analyses statement. 14An electronic search was performed using the following databases PubMed (until January 31, 2018), EMBASE (until January 31, 2018), Scopus (until January 31, 2018), and Cochrane Central Reg-ister of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) databases (until January 31, 2018). The computerized search was performed using the following search terms \"(ACL reconstruction AND histology AND human) OR (ACL reconstruction AND histology AND human). \"Study Selection Eligibility criteria: (1) ACL reconstruction with hamstring autograft, (2) tendon-to-bone interface tissue biopsy, and (3) tendon healing in bone tunnel was evaluated by histology. Exclusion criteria: (1) ACL and (2) only intra-articular graft was biopsied and evaluated. Study Quality Assessment The methodological quality of the selected studies was assessed with regard to study design, sample size, surgicaltechniques, detailed description of the biopsy procedure, use of independent or blinded examiners, and the adequate reporting of the techniques used to examine the specimens. Data Extraction Two reviewers independently extracted data from all eligiblestudies with a predeveloped data extraction form. The following information was collected: design of study, sample size, surgical techniques, graft type, graft xation, resurgery indications for biopsy, biopsy procedures, techniques used to examine the samples, interval between ACL reconstruction and biopsy, and tendon-to-bone healing process. Any dis-crepancies between reviewers were resolved by consensus, and if necessary, a third reviewer would be consulted to make the nal decision. Results Literature Search The literature search totally generated 2,628 relevant citations from the four databases ( Fig. 1 ). After excluding the duplicates, there were 1,846 articles left. Subsequent review of the title/abstracts generated 11 articles that PubMed (n=1705); EMBASE (n=462); Scopus (n=457); CENTRAL (n=4) Excluded because of overlapping between the above databases (n=757) Potentially relevant studies identified and screened for retrieval ( n=1871) Studies retrieved for more detailed evaluation ( n=11)Excluded after reviewing the abstract (n=1860) Excluded ( histology (2) Allografts used (n=2) Included (n=2): Reviewing the reference and citation list of each eligible study ( n=2) Studies included in systematic review ( n=10) Fig. 1 Theflow diagram illustrating the search process.

Seven of 10 studies reported the age of the patients, with a range of 14 to 42 yearsold. 17,20 -23,26,27The interval between ACL reconstruction and biopsy ranged from 6 weeks to 3 years. The surgical techniques were variable among the included studies.Arthroscopic-assisted ACL reconstructions were only reported in four studies. 15,21,22,27The other six studies did not detail the surgical techniques. The graft xation techni- ques greatly differed between reports. The main study characteristics are summarized in Table 1 . Study Quality Assessment of the methodologic quality of these studies revealed that no prospective studies could be retrievedowing to the invasive nature of the biopsy procedure. Four reports were case series (level of evidence 4). 18,20,21,23The remaining six reports were case reports (level of evidence5). 15-17,22,26,27Only one of the included reports used a blinded, independent examiner to evaluate the specimens.18 Biopsy Procedure Most specimens were harvested during revision ACL recon- struction associated with traumatic graft failure or recurrent knee dysfunction ( Table 1 ).15-18,20 -23,26Ten specimens were obtained during TransFix device removal because ofpersistent pain on the lateral side of the knee. 18One speci- men was obtained during knee resection for tibial osteosarcoma.27 The graft -bone interface tissues were mainly biopsied by coring a tunnel with a diameter of 4 to 10 mm and varied length ( Table 1 ). Six specimens were obtained under arthroscopy with a diameter of 4 to 7 mm by a sharp spoon.18 Ten specimens were taken by coring a tunnel of 5 mm indiameter and 20 mm long along the femoral TransFix axis toobtain a cylindrical core of tissue composed of bone and ligament, 2 cm from the femoral outlet. 21 Study Techniques All samples were subjected to light microscopic evaluation. Sample preparation was similar in these reports with regardtoxation, dehydrating, and embedding of the specimens. Most specimens were stained using standard hematoxylin and eosin and Masson trichrome ( Table 2 ).15-17,21,23,27 Additionally, polarized light microscopy was used to explore the continuity of the collagen bers of the tendon and bone in most studies ( Table 2 ).15,17,18,20 -23,27In all includedstudies, histologic changes during the graft -bone healing process were only qualitatively analyzed. None of the studiesanalyzed the histologic results in a quantitative way. Tendon Graft Healing in Bone Tunnel The study by Robert et al included 12 cases, with the largest sample size, and summarized the changes occurring in the healing of graft to bone and divided into three stages.21None of the other studies analyzed the histological data based on different stages. The histological results of these studies were summarized based on the three stages ( Table 2 ). At 3 months, a brovascular interface was seen between the tendon and uncalci ed osteoid with very few collagen bers. One study reported that Sharpey-like bers was visible at tibial tunnel as early as 6 weeks in one case.16 Another study also showed collagen ber continuity between tibial bone tunnel and tendon at 3 to 4 months intwo cases. 15The study by Lazarides et al included a case with knee resection at 4 months and revealed that collagen bers were tightly interfaced into the surrounding bone withabundant bony ingrowth within the tibial tunnel, while there was an abundance of fat and no clear osseous in ltration within the femoral tunnel. There was abundant new boneformation and evidence of remodeling near the tibial screw insertion site. 27 At 6 months, the brous interface was in continuous contact with the osteoid tissue covering lamellar bone, and Sharpey-like bers started to be visible. One study by Nebe- lung et al included one case after ACL reconstruction usinginterference screw and revealed a rm attachment of tendi- nous tissue to the bone tunnel of femur at 8 months. 20 At 10 months, mature indirect anchorage, characterizing Sharpey-like bers, was obtained. The study by Heyde et al included ve cases after ACL reconstruction with Synthes Milagro screw and revealed collagenous Sharpey-like bers which extended from the tendon tissue radiated into the surrounding bone, with chondral metaplasia in the tibialtunnel at 8 to 24 months. 23The study by Petersen and Laprell included six cases after ACL reconstruction using EndoButton and Cramp and con rmed the healing of hamstring grafts in both tibial and femoral tunnels by formation of a brous insertion during 6 to 33 months.18One study by Fankhauser et al included one case and revealed collagen- brous tendi- nous tissue with some myxoid degeneration, focal scanty mesenchymal proliferation at the tibial and femoral articular site at 2 years. The Shar-pey-like collagenous brils could be detected by polarized light microscopy within the bone tunnel, along with atro- phied fatty study by Eriksson et al showed that completed osseointegration of the graft had occurred with continuity of the collagen bers of the tendon and tibial bone and formation of an interface resembling normal tendon to bone insertion in one case at 1 year.17 Overall, 10 cases from four studies were reported with negative results.

Necrotic tendon graft was only seen in two cases from two studies at 6 to 12 weeks.15,16Three studies explored the tendon-to-bone healing differences at different site22,23,27 and two studies revealed that tendon graft healed better at the articular tunnel aperture site than the intratunnel part.22,23Cartilage-like tissue at tendon graft -bone interface was only reported in three studies in which interference screw was used for graft xation ( Table 2 ).17,20,23 Discussion Tendon graft healing in bone tunnel after ACL reconstruction has been explored widely in animal studies. Knowledge about tendon graft -bone healing process in human subjects is very limited due to the invasive and unethical nature. Thisstudy for the rst time pooled all available studies to under- stand the healing process of tendon to bone after hamstring ACL reconstruction. The ndings of the current systematic review indicated that a brovascular interface was formed between tendon graft and bone tunnel at early stage of3m o n t h s .A brous interface in continuous contact with the bone tunnel could be expected at around 6 months. An indirect insertion, characterizing Sharpey-like bers, tended to be matured after 10 and tibial ACL insertions belong cartilage, and bone. 28This complex composite insertion is responsible for effectively transmitting the forces from liga-ment to bone. 29,30However, this study revealed that the brocartilaginous insertion was not interface instead. The outcomes following ACL reconstruction were reported to be generally good, with the success rates varybetween 73 and 95%, in the literature. 31-33The study by Robert et al indicated that tendon-to-bone healing was not always necessary for clinical stability of the knee joint.21 Rodeo et al studied the extensor tendon healing in the transtibial tunnel of dogs. At 12 and 24 weeks, polarizedlight microscopy showed evidence of collagen bers con- necting the tendon to the surrounding bone and tensiletesting revealed that all specimens failed by pull-out of the tendon from the clamp or by mid-substance rupture of the tendon. Although a brocartilaginous insertion was not formed at the tendon -bone interface, tendon failed at the tendon-clamp junction or mid-substance of the tendon, not at the tendon -bone interface. 34These might explain why most patients are satis ed with the outcomes although a brocartilaginous insertion is not regenerated after ACL reconstruction. A secure mechanical xation is required to meet the demand of a rapid return of knee function in the early postoperative period before biologic incorporation of thegraft in the bone tunnels. Many options are currently avail- able that provide rigid xation of hamstring graft. Commonly used xation methods could be divided into two types: (1) xation at the joint surface with interference screw and (2) xation at a distance such as staples, screws with washers, TransFix and EndoButton. 35Weiler et al demonstrated that xation at the joint surface using interference txation might neutralize tendon graft-tunnel motions, and thus promoted the development of a direct type of ligamentinsertion at the joint surface. 36However, in this systematic review, cartilage-like tissue at tendon graft -bone interface was only reported in limited cases though interference screwwas used for graft xation. In the study by Weiler et al, the interference screw was inserted into the tibial tunnel in an inside-out direction, so that the head of the screw was flush with the intra-articular aperture of the tibial tunnel. 36 Currently, the interference screw was usually inserted intothe tibial tunnel in an outside-in direction, and this techni-que would reduce the compression of interference screw on the graft. Graft tunnel motion at the intra-articular aperture of the tibial tunnel would be expected in this technique, especially when the length of the interference screw is shorter than the length of the tibial tunnel. A direct bro- cartilaginous insertion was not regenerated in the included studies as that of Weiler et al 's study, 36possibly because of graft motion existed at intra-articular aperture of bonetunnel. 6 Thexation of the hamstring tendon far from the tunnel aperture did not compress the tendon graft along the lengthof the tunnel as xation with interference screw. This technique may allow the ingrowth of blood vessels along the entire length of the tendon graft. 35In this study, 37 cases were included for analysis. Unexpectedly, there were 10 cases failed to integrate tendon graft with the surrounding bone and suspensory type of xation was used in these failure cases. Early intratunnel motion of the graft was considered to preclude graft tendon healing to bone. Graft motion would be expected when suspensory type of xation was used. The study by Lazarides et al explored the tendon- to-bone healing differences between interference screw versus EndoButton, and indicated that xation with inter- ference screw leading to an indirect ligamentous insertion andxation with EndoButton leading to viability of the graft The Journal of Knee Surgery Vol. 32 No. 5/2019Tendon Healing in Bone Tunnel Lu et al. 459 This document was downloaded for personal use only.

This might explain why there was better knee stability inthe suspensory xation group and recon rmed that tendon- was not always necessary for clinical stabi- lity of the knee joint. It has been suggested that differences in the histologic appearance of the tendon-to-bone attachment on different sides of the bone tunnel. Weiler et al demonstrated thatintratunnel healing was only important during early healing stages. When solid surface healing occurred, the intratunnel part of the graft tissue might be stress shielded, resulting in apartial resorption and continuous tunnel narrowing over time. 36This was con rmed by Fankhauser et al 's study, in which Sharpey-like collagen bers was found bridging the bone and the graft, along with atrophied tendinous tissue, fatty atrophic deposits, and focal regenerative vascular pro- liferation.22The study by Lazarides et al revealed that the collagen bers were tightly interfaced into the surrounding bone within bone tunnel and there was abundant new bone formation and evidence of remodeling at the aperture site.27 The study by Weiler et al found a direct ligament insertion formed at the joint surface with these speci c transition zones after tendon graft implantation into a bone tunnel.36 Both studies by Fankhauser et al and Lazarides et al did not reveal a direct ligament insertion formed at the joint surface although interference screw was used for graft xation.22,27 In contrast, Rodeo et al employed a rabbit ACL reconstruction model with suspensory xation and demonstrated that tendon-to-bone healing was slower at the intra-articular tunnel aperture than at the tunnel exit.39This difference might be owing to the presence of graft tunnel motion in thegrafts xed with suspensory xation. It is clear that tendon-to-bone healing process is a con- tinuum of biologic changes rather than a series of distinct,time-dependent biologic events. Based on animal studies, tendon graft healing in bone tunnel could be divided into four stages: (1) in flammatory phase, (2) proliferative phase, (3) matrix synthesis, and (4) matrix remodeling. 7,10An inltration and recruitment of in flammatory cells and stem cells could result in the release of cytokines and growthfactors, leading to an ingrowth of blood vessels and nerves. In the current review, a brovascular interface was developed at 3 months, probably corresponding to the in flammatory phase and proliferative phase. During the matrix synthesis phase, collagen bers form at tendon -bone interface. At 6m o n t h s ,t h e brous interface was in continuous contact with the surrounding bone, probably corresponding to matrix synthesis phase. At the matrix remodeling phase, thenewly formed graft -bone interface remodeled with mature collagen bers formed between tendon graft and bone tunnel. At 10 months, mature indirect insertion with Shar- pey-like bers was formed, probably corresponding to matrix remodeling phase. However, due to the lack of enoughhigh-quality studies, it is far from understanding of the tendon-to-bone healing process. There are several limitations existed in this review. First, all the included studies were case series or case reports. There were massive differences in surgical techniques, graft xations, and rehabilitation protocols among included stu- dies. The level of evidence of these reports was too poor to draw a de nite conclusion. Further studies with standard surgical and xation techniques are highly needed to under- stand the healing process of tendon to bone. Second, due to the invasive nature of the biopsy procedure and its potential deleterious effects, most specimens included were harvestedduring revision ACL reconstruction associated with trau- matic graft failure or recurrent knee dysfunction. Only one study retrieved an entire knee joint from a boy with osteo-sarcoma of the tibia. The graft healing process in this case was similar to that reported in several included studies. The biopsy location of the tunnel was not clear among includedstudies. Standardized biopsy procedures would help provide a better understanding of tendon graft healing to bone in human ACL reconstruction. Third, most included studiesonly employed standard staining methods, not immunohis- tochemical methods. Certain speci c proteins or cell types of the healing interface could not be explored. The histologicalresults of all eligible studies were only qualitatively analyzed. Future studies with large sample size may include immuno- histochemistry and qualitative analysis. Fourth, 10 of 37(27%) cases were reported with negative results in the systematic review. Most specimens were harvested during revision ACL reconstruction. The rate of negative results might have been overestimated. In addition, the graft - bone interface was unloaded during the time of traumaand revision surgery. This might also affect the healing process of tendon graft in bone tunnel. These results might not be entirely representative. In summary, the key nding of this systematic review is that an indirect type of insertion with Sharpey-like bers between tendon and bone would be expected after ACLreconstruction with hamstring. Cartilage-like tissue may be formed in the tendon -bone interface occasionally. A rm tendon-to-bone healing was not always necessary for clinical stability of the knee joint. The underlying graft bone healing process is far from understood in the human ACL reconstruction with hamstring. Further human studies arehighly needed to understand tendon graft healing in bone tunnel after hamstring ACL reconstruction.
