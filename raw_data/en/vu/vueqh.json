It's a winning solution\u2014students gain real-world experience and their clients get Bauer's brand of high-energy business know-how. This year, O'Rourke Petroleum, a large regional specialty fuels and lubricants distributor, hired six M.B.A. students from the Business Consulting Lab program to identify cost savings in their operations. The students went to work and came up with a solution that saved the company $1 million. More energy , less pollution ... all at a lower cost. In this era of rising energy prices, it might sound like a dream, but UH researchers are working to make it a reality . The answer is solid oxide fuel cells, says Allan Jacobson, Texas Center for Superconductivity at the University of Houston director, Robert A. Welch Chair in Science, and professor of chemistry . Fuel cells are limited to small scale and special applications, such as on the space shuttle; however, Jacobson is working to bring the technology closer to home. The challenge is the high temperatures required for efficient fuel cell reactions\u2014the process requires exotic and expensive materials. Jacobson's team is developing a process with new, cheaper materials that allow fuel cell reactions to occur at a lower temperature. Initial applications will begin in niche markets, such as the trucking industry . A likely benefit of Jacobson's research includes diesel-powered trucks using fuel cell power units to maintain air conditioning and refrigeration when the vehicles are stationary . This would save fuel and eliminate emissions when big-rig drivers utilize rest stops.Fuel cells bring cheap, clean energy EnE R G Y Some people thought the global energy workforce was running on empty, but UH is helping companies hire and retain qualified professionals.

In Texas alone, 120 billion barrels of oil are stranded in \"dead\" wells\u2014enough to keep the entire world running for four years. Some of this oil has been passed up because it simply sticks to the rocks. Not anymore, says Kishore Mohanty , professor of chemical engineering. He has developed a technology that could recover 15 billion barrels of stranded oil in Texas alone and billions more worldwide. Fifteen billion barrels of oil is enough to feed American oil consumption for three years. Mohanty's technology is cheap, effective, and works like a clothing detergent for oil-soaked rocks. He uses low concentrations of chemicals called surfactants that essentially wash oil off the rock so that it can be collected. The estimated cost of this process is about 50 cents to $1 per barrel to recover oil from an otherwise dead well. His efforts earned endorsement and financial support from the U.S. Department of Energy, as well as partnerships with energy giants such as ExxonMobil, BP , Chevron Corporation, and Schlumberger.EnE R G Y EnGinEER BRinGS \"DEAD\" WEllS Professor Kishore Mohanty is shown with oil recovered from a fractured rock by the diluted surfactant treatment.

Each year, oil companies lose hundreds of millions of dollars in failed drilling attempts or by drilling wells that yield less oil than expected\u2014a cost absorbed by the consumer. Working like an army of underground engineers, Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering Richard Liu's radios, when fully developed, will give a bird's-eye view of a process known as well logging\u2014recording of a well's underground properties to find oil-rich zones. The tiny technology is suited to withstand the extreme conditions of the job that hinder traditional well logging technologies\u2014the radios can withstand temperatures of 300 degrees or higher and pressures in excess of 20,000 pounds. As the radios are circulated, they transmit information to the surface for analysis, allowing for faster, more accurate drilling\u2014potentially saving millions of dollars on every well on which the technology is used.The T exas Center for Superconductivity at the University of Houston is fueling cutting-edge research that may lead to the new power grid of the future with applications for increased efficiency and energy savings. Scientist uses submarine technology for accurate oil maps The greatest risk in oil exploration is not knowing what lies beneath. John Castagna may have solved that problem to some extent. Using a sophisticated version of the echolocation used in submarines, ships, and radar systems, he developed algorithms that translate seismic waves that not only detect fluids, but also can differentiate between porous rock filled with water, oil, or gas. The result is a cost-effective image of an underground reservoir that gives engineers a precise road map of where to drill, how far to drill, and how much of the resources can be extracted\u2014all reducing exploration costs.
