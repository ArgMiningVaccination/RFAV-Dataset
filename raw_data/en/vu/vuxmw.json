Numbers in the text and tables may not add up to totals be cause of rounding. The options in this report do not reflect the governmental reorganization involved in the creation of the Department of Homeland Security. The budgetary effects of the options are estimated in various ways. For options involving defense discretionary spending, savings are measured relative to the Department of Defense'smost recent plan, as modified by lawmaker s in enacting 2003 approp riations. For options involving nondefense discretionary spending, savings are measured in comparison with the levelof 2003 appropriations adjusted for inflation. (In m ost cases, that le vel represents the appropriations outlined in the continuing resolution that was in effect when the options wereprepared; in a few cases, it represents the a ppropriations enacted on February 20, 2003, in the Consolidated Appropriations Resolution for 2003.) For options that affe ct mandatory spending, savings are measured in relation to the Congressional Budget Office's (CBO's) current \u0010law baseline. For revenue options, the effects are estimated relative to current \u0010law projections; most of the estimates come from the Joint Committee on Taxation, although a few were producedby CBO. For the long \u0010term Social Security and Medicare options in Chapter 4, savings are estimated by CBO and are measured in relation to the size of the economy (as a percentage ofgross domestic product). The tables and charts shown on the cover come from Congressional Budget Office, The Budget and Economic Outlook: Fiscal Years 2004 \u00102013 (January 2003).Preface T his volume\u2014one of the Congressional Budget Office's (CBO's) regular reports to the House and Senate Committees on the Budget\u2014presents options to alter federal outlays and receipts, both in the near term and over a longer horizon. The report does not adopt a particu \u0010 lar fiscal goal or budget target but presents a variety of options to help policymakers in theirannual tasks of making budgetary choices, setti ng priorities, and adapting to changes in cir \u0010 cumstances. It is the latest in a series of compendiums of policy options prepared by CBOover the years. As a nonpartisan Congressional agency, CBO does not make recommendations about policy. Instead, the options discussed in this report stem from various sources. They are derived from legislative proposals, the President's budget, Congressional and CBO staff, other government entities, and private groups. The inclusion or exclusion of a particular idea does not represent an endorsement or rejection by CBO. The options are intended to reflect a range of possibili \u0010 ties; they are neither ranked nor comprehensive. In keeping with CBO's mandate to provideobjective and impartial analysis, the discussion of each option presents the cases for and against it. Budget Options begins with an introductory chapter that discusses the budget outlook, presents general rationales for the policy options that follow, and explains how to use the volume. Chapter 2 presents dozens of options to cut spending or add receipts, organized by the func \u0010 tional categories of the budget\u2014national defense, international affairs, energy, and so on. Theoptions for each function are introduced with a page of background information about spend \u0010 ing trends in that function. Chapter 3 contains specific options that affect revenues. Chapter 4 presents a discussion of strategies for slowing the growth of Social Security and Medicare. The appendix lists the many contributors to this report. This volume is available in multiple formats on CBO's Web site (www.cbo.gov), including a version that permits users to search and retrieve options by function, agency, and other crite \u0010 ria.

issued a compendium of options to help informfederal policymakers about budgetary choices. Policy \u0010 makers must decide how m uch to spend, which programs to fund, what level of revenues is needed to sustain those programs, and how those revenues are to be raised. Those decisions are framed by current fiscal and economic con \u0010 ditions: how large is the annual deficit or surplus, what is the budget outlook for the near and the long term, and what new fiscal and budgetary challenges do lawmakers face? Those determinations are also made in light of broad goals for fiscal policy, such as balancing the budget, enhancing economic stability and growth, ensuring sus \u0010 tainable fiscal policies for the long term, or limiting the size of government. Budgetary decisions may serve other purposes or rationales as well, including offsetting the cost of new initiatives, reordering budgetary priorities in a time of change, or making programs more efficient or effective. The budget options in this volume are intended to assist policymakers as they address those and other fis \u0010 cal and budgetary issues duri ng the course of the 108th Congress. The Budget Outlook The near\u0010term budget outlook has changed significantly over the past several years. After a decade of decreasing deficits\u2014capped by a string of record surpluses from 1998 to 2001\u2014the federal budg et reversed course in 2002 and returned to a deficit.1 For the next decade,CBO projects that if current tax and spending policies remained in place, unified budget deficits would peak this year and drop steadily to yield small but growing sur \u0010 pluses later in the 2004 \u00102013 period.2 The Uncertainty of Projections Budget projections are always subject to considerable un \u0010 certainty. In particular, CBO's baseline is required to show future spending and revenues under current laws and policies. Those laws and policies will almost certainly change, however. Lawmakers are contemplating major new initiatives to, for example, raise economic growth, provide a prescription drug benefit to the elderly, and ad \u0010 dress other priorities. None of those possibilities (or their likely budgetary effects) is reflected in CBO's baseline projections because they would involve changes to current laws and policies. Thus, the actual budget totals for the projection period are virtually guaranteed to differ from the estimates in CBO's baseline, perhaps substantially. In addition, the nation now confronts the possibility of military conflict with Iraq, the ongoing threat of terror \u0010 ism, and the new demands of homeland security. More \u0010 over, long \u0010term budgetary pressures linked to the aging of the baby \u0010boom generation will begin to emerge near the end of the current 10 \u0010year budget horizon. 1. For a discussion of recent budgetary and economic trends, see Con \u0010 gressional Budget Office, The Budget and Economic Outlook: Fiscal Years 2004 \u00102013 (January 2003).2. CBO's next set of budget projections will be published in An Analysis of the President's Budgetary Proposals for Fiscal Year 2004(forthcoming in March 2003). Unified budget amounts include the off\u0010budget transactions of the So cial Security trust funds and the Postal Service.CHAPTER2 BUDGET OPTIONS Budgetary Choices and Fiscal Goals Since the mid \u00101980s, lawmakers have made budgetary choices within a statutory framework of fiscal targets. Those targets, and the general structure of CBO's budget options volumes, have been constructed around the goal of reducing and eliminatin g budget deficits. From 1985 to 1990, the federal government legislated targets for deficits along a fixed trajectory that declined to zero.3 That regime failed to achieve its stated goal and was sup \u0010 planted in 1990 by the Budget Enforcement Act (BEA), which established annual limits on discretionary appro \u0010 priations and a pay \u0010as\u0010you\u0010go requirement for new laws dealing with mandatory spending or revenues.4 The BEA framework was intended to ensure that new legislationdid not cause deficits to rise (or surpluses to fall). It ex \u0010 pired on September 30, 2002. During most of the period that the BEA procedures were in place, the federal government's unified budget balance improved significantly. Deficits declined steadily after 1992, and beginning in 1998, surpluses we re recorded each year through 2001. The BEA framewor k helped to preserve budget discipline, but its effectiveness started to erode as surpluses began to emerge. 5 Nonetheless, large surpluses continued to accumu late because of a surge in tax revenues stemming mainly from robust economic growth. But the recession in 2001 together with the terrorist attacks of September 11\u2014and lawmakers'responses to those events\u2014caused a sharp drop in federal revenues and a spike in spending that contributed to a return to a deficit in 2002.The expiration of the BEA framework raises a broader question: what is the appropriate fiscal goal for the na \u0010 tion, in both the near term and the long term? Through \u0010 out the 1980s and 1990s, a broad consensus formed around the goal of eliminating deficits. Although balanc \u0010 ing the budget each year has been a common fiscal goal,policymakers also have articulated other goals. For exam \u0010 ple, balancing the budget over the business cycle is a goalthat takes into account the tendency of public spending to rise and revenues to fall when the economy is weak and to do the reverse when the economy is strong. Such auto \u0010 matic budgetary responses tend to dampen cyclical fluc \u0010 tuations. However, even a fiscal policy that balances the budget in the current year or over the business cycle may not be sustainable over the long term. Under current policies, demographic changes and other factors will generate ris \u0010 ing spending for entitlement programs such as SocialSecurity and Medicare, especi ally in years beyond the current 10 \u0010year budget horizon. If, as a result, budget deficits increase, they will lead to greater borrowing from the public. If unchecked, th at growth in borrowing and the resulting levels of public debt may become explosive.Alternatively, a fiscal policy that fails to balance the bud \u0010 get in the near term may be sustainable if levels of federaldebt relative to the size of the economy are constrained over the long term. Another important fiscal goal could involve making deci \u0010 sions about the appropriate size of government. Main \u0010 taining an appropriate \u0010sized government may be moti \u0010 vated by the desire to allow sufficient scope for market incentives and thereby encourage economic growth. Al \u0010 though governments can provide important benefits totheir citizenry, some public programs may be inefficient. Moreover, increases in spending eventually require higher revenues, and tax hikes in general distort the economic decisions of individuals and businesses. This volume does not advocate or adopt a particular fiscal goal or budget target. Instead, it presents a variety of op \u0010 tions to help policymakers in their annual tasks of makingbudgetary choices, setting priorities, and adapting to changed circumstances.3. Those targets were set by the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, referred to as the Gramm \u0010Rudman\u0010 Hollings Act. They were revised and extended by the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Reaffirmation Act of 1987. 4. The BEA divided all spending into two categories for purposes of enforcing the discretionary sp ending limits and the pay \u0010as\u0010you\u0010go requirement. In general, discretionary spending is provided andcontrolled by appropriation acts, and mandatory (or direct)spending is provided by laws other than appropriation acts. 5.

In general, they would cut spending or increase revenues in the interest of reducing deficits, maintaining overall fiscal discipline, dealing with long \u0010term budgetary pressures, or achieving other fiscal policy goals. But cer \u0010 tain options could serve additional purposes. For ex \u0010 ample, they could be used to help reorder budgetary pri \u0010 orities, offset the cost of new initiatives, limit the overall size of the federal government, restructure programs to achieve policy goals at a lower cost, or improve the effi \u0010 ciency and effectiveness of federal programs. Options to Reduce Spending Chapter 2 of this volume presents options to decreasespending. Lawmakers may seek such options to meet near\u0010term fiscal goals, make trade \u0010offs among budgetary priorities, or to reorder those priorities. For example, pro \u0010 posals to substantially increase funding for some discre \u0010 tionary programs, such as ones for hom eland security and defense, may have to be offset with reductions elsewhere in the budget if lawmakers decide to limit the rate of growth for total discretionary spending. Options to reduce spending may also help meet policy or programmatic goals that differ from or are broader than the goal of achieving budgetary savings to comply with a particular fiscal target. For example, some of the options in this volume could be used to reduce the size of government, limit its rate of growth, or scale back activities for which the appropriateness of a federal role was questioned. Other alternatives would enable law \u0010 makers to restructure programs to achieve their goals at a lower cost or to eliminate programs that might have outlived their usefulness or achieved the purposes for which they were created. In some cases, options may re \u0010 flect changed conditions that could lead to different bud \u0010 getary priorities and a shift in funding from one program to another. For example, some options for defense are based on new threats to national security, which may lead lawmakers to reduce resources for some defense activities and increase them for others. Options That Affect Revenues Chapter 3 presents various options for changing federaltax law. The criteria for including revenue options in this volume are the three goals that guide the federal tax struc \u0010ture: efficiency, equity, and simplicity. In most cases, the options would result in higher revenues, but some op \u0010 tions would cause tax collections to fall. Efficiency de \u0010 mands that taxes distort behavior as little as possible. That criterion often requires comparable taxation of alternative economic activities, so some revenue options would eliminate tax provisions that favor particular ac \u0010 tivities over others. For example, eliminating the tax in \u0010 centives accorded to oil and gas extraction would treat those activities more like other production and cause businesses and investors to allocate resources among industries on the basis of economic returns rather than tax considerations. Other options would offset ineffi \u0010 ciencies that might occur in private markets by taxing activities that impose costs on others. Taxing the emission of pollutants such as sulfur dioxide, for example, would encourage firms to reduce their emissions in a cost \u0010 effective manner. Another type of option would alter tax provisions whose desirable goals could be achieved more effectively in a different way. For example, substituting a tax credit for the exclusion of interest income on state and local debt would maintain the current level of tax incentives for borrowing by state and local governments while reducing the federal costs. Distributional considerations may arise as well. A com \u0010 mon rule is that taxpayers in similar economic circum \u0010 stances pay similar taxes\u2014a principle known as hori \u0010 zontal equity. Alternatively, there is the desire to distrib \u0010 ute the tax burden among taxpayers with various amounts of income in conformance with the wishes of policy \u0010 makers\u2014vertical equity. An option that would improve horizontal equity, for example, would make investment income from life insurance and annuities taxable, thus treating those forms of income in the same way as income from other sources such as bank accounts, taxable bonds, and mutual funds. Other options would seek to adjust vertical equity. Lessening the tax system's complexity would reduce its administrative costs as well as the costs of compliance for taxpayers. Consolidating the child credit and the personal exemption for children, for example, would make it easier for families to complete their tax returns. Similarly, re \u0010 placing the panoply of tax rates that apply to long \u0010term capital gains with a single tax rate applied to only a per \u0010 centage of gains would greatly simplify the multipage4 BUDGET OPTIONS form that taxpayers must now complete. Such sim \u0010 plification would also increase the transparency of the tax system, thus making it easier for taxpayers to understand how much they are taxed on their income. Possible modifications to the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Ac t of 2001 (EGTRRA) are pre \u0010 sented in terms of efficiency, equity, and simplicity. That law's major tax \u0010cutting provisions are unique in that they phase in over nearly a decade and are scheduled to expire at the end of December 2010, resulting in a reversion of most tax laws to their pre \u00102001 status. That situation makes planning for the future difficult for taxpayers. Fur \u0010 thermore, most observers expect that the Congress will not allow EGTRRA to expire but will instead modify its provisions before 2011, adding to taxpayers' planning problems. The Congress could simplify the situation by stabilizing the law. One approach would simply extend or make permanent all of the fully phased \u0010in provisions of the law. Alternatively, the Congress could elect to extend the law by modifying specific parts. The final group of revenue options in Chapter 3 comprises various alternatives for such modifications. Those options range from ones that would freeze provisions short of their final levels to others that would make particular parts of the law permanent. Unlike most other revenue options, some options affecting EGTRRA would reduce rather than raise revenues. Options to Slow the Growth of Social Security and Medicare In the absence of changes to current policy, the aging of the population and the continued growth of health care costs over the next several decades will bring about major structural shifts in the federal budget, substantially in \u0010 creasing the amount of resources directed toward pro \u0010 grams for the elderly. CBO projects that spending on Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid combined will climb from 8 percent of GDP today to 14 percent in 2030 and 21 percent in 2075, and as a consequence, unsustainable levels of deficits and public debt will emerge. Chapter 4 discusses broad options for slowing the growth of Social Security and Medicare, the two largest federal entitlement programs. Because the major budgetary pres \u0010 sures facing those programs arise over a longer horizon,potential savings from those options are presented over a 75\u0010year time frame and are measured relative to the size of the economy rather than in dollar amounts. Using This Volume The options to cut spending in Chapter 2 are classified according to the appropriate functional categories of the budget\u2014defense ( 050), international affairs (150), and so on. For each function, an introductory page provides summary information and da ta since 1990 on overall trends in mandatory and discretionary spending within that function. For each option, the discussion provides some general background, includes arguments for and against the option, identifies whether it affects mandatory or discretionary spending, estimates the annual reduction in spending for 2004 throug h 2008, and sums up reduc \u0010 tions both for that five \u0010year period and for the 10 \u0010year period that ends in 2013. Those options are numbered individually and include, where appropriate, references to related options and to relevant CBO publications. The savings from options affecting mandatory spending were computed from baseline levels estimated to occur under current law. The savi ngs from options affecting nondefense discretionary spending generally were calcu \u0010 lated from the continuing appropriation levels (adjusted for inflation) that were in e ffect at the time the options were prepared. Full \u0010year appropriations for those pro \u0010 grams and activities were enacted on February 20, 2003, in the Consolidated Appropriations Resolution for 2003. Except where noted, the estimated reduction in spending measured in relation to the full \u0010year appropriation law did not differ significantly from that calculated under continuing appropriation levels. Savings affecting discre \u0010 tionary spending for defense were measured relative to the Department of Defense's most recent plan as modi \u0010 fied by lawmakers in enac ting appropriations for 2003. (The defense and military construction appropriation acts for 2003, which cover most de fense programs and activi \u0010 ties, were enacted last fall.) New or increased fees may be classified as offsets to spending (offsetting receipts or col \u0010 lections) or as new revenues (governmental receipts).6 6. In general, if the fee supports a businesslike activity, it is classified as an offset to spending. If it is based on the government's sovereignCHAPTER ONE INTRODUCTION 5 Chapter 3 discusses options that affect revenues, follow \u0010 ing the format used in Chapter 2 for options to reduce spending. The revenue options are numbered individually and include references to related options and to applic \u0010 able CBO publications. Each option includes some gen \u0010 eral background information, arguments for and against the option, estimate s of the change in revenues for 2004 through 2008, and the cumulati ve impact on revenues both for that five \u0010year period and for the 10 \u0010year period that ends in 2013. The esti mates were computed from baseline revenue levels projected under current law.7 An \"interactive\" version of this volume offering enhanced search capabilities is available on CBO's Web site (www. cbo.gov). That version allows users to search the entire volume by word or phrase. For the specific, numbered policy options in Chapter 2, users can search by spending category (mandatory or discretionary), by budget func \u0010 tion, and by federa l agency. Those searches can be per \u0010 formed singly or in combination and can also be joined with searches by word or phrase. Exclusions and Limitations Both the broad and the specific budget options discussed in this volume stem from various sources, including legislative proposals, the President's budget, Congres \u0010 sional and CBO staff, other government entities, and private groups. The options are intended to reflect arange of possibilities; they are neither ranked nor com \u0010 prehensive. The inclusion or exclusion of a particular op \u0010 tion does not represent an endorsement or rejection by CBO. As a nonpartisan Congressional staff agency, CBO does not make policy recommendations. Because the options that address spending are also in \u0010 tended to facilitate the case \u0010by\u0010case review of individual programs, they exclude certain types of governmentwide options that would produce savings in many programs or agencies. Such options would, for example, freeze or cut federal spending across the board or eliminate an en \u0010 tire department or major agency. Some of the options affecting state, local, or tribal gov \u0010 ernments or the private sector may involve federal man \u0010 dates. The Unfunded Mand ates Reform Act of 1995 establishes procedures that are intended to control such mandates and requires CBO to estimate the costs of mandates imposed by new legislation that the Congress is considering. However, individual options in this vol \u0010 ume do not estimate the costs of potential mandates. In calculating the changes to spending or revenues for the individual options, CBO did not include changes in fed \u0010 eral interest costs. Interest costs or savings typically are estimated as part of a comprehensive budget plan, such as the Congressional budget resolution, but such adjust \u0010 ments are not usually made for individual options of the type discussed in this volume. Subsequent CBO cost estimates (as well as subsequent revenue estimates by the Joint Committee on Taxation) for legislative proposals that resemble options in this volume may not match the estimates shown in this re \u0010 port. The policy proposals on which those later estimates are based may not precisely match the options in this volume. Further, the baseline budget estimates or levels against which such proposals ultimately are measured may have been updated and thus would differ from those used here.power to tax, it is classified as a revenue. Fees classified as spending offsets may be further categorize d as either mandatory or discre \u0010 tionary, depending generally on the type of legislation that provided for the collections. 7. For cost estimates of legislation that would amend the Internal Revenue Code, CBO is required by law to use estimates provided by the Joint Committee on Taxa tion. The commi ttee estimated the change in revenue collections that would result from all butthree of the options in Chapter 3. For those options\u201413, 14, and 15\u2014CBO prepared the estimates.2 Options to Reduce SpendingCHAPTER050 National Defense Budget function 050 comprises spending fo r national defense.

Options emphasizing cost \u0010effectiveness would provide a given capability at lower cost or cutprograms that are particularly expensive for the capabilitythey provide. In addition, many of the investment op \u0010 tions represent ideas similar to ones that the Admin \u0010 istration is considering to transform the military. CBO'soptions are designed to provide net savings. DoD's noninvestment activities\u2014which include provid \u0010 ing compensation to military and civilian personnel, pay \u0010 ing contractors for purchases of services, and paying forthe fuel and other supplies routinely consumed duringDoD's day \u0010to\u0010day operations\u2014will account for $250 billion (or two \u0010thirds) of DoD's budget authority in 2003. Several of the national se curity options that address those operating costs focus on the benefits provided tomilitary personnel. The costs of those benefits are grow \u0010 ing: under current policies, annual spending for militarymedical care would rise from $28 billion today to $38billion by 2013 (in 2002 dollars ). Other options wouldseek to improve DoD's use of military personnel. Those options might be viewed either as ways to reduce thenumber of service members and achieve budgetary sav \u0010 ings or as ways to free up personnel for counterterrorismdefense or other new missions without increasing the sizeof the force. As readers examine the options, they will find that al \u0010 though the table in each option reports savings withrespect to budget authority and outlays, the text refers toeither one or the other. Some options that deal withweapon systems refer to budget authority because spend \u0010 ing rates for those weapons programs tend to be quiteslow. Other options, especially ones that deal with oper \u0010 ation and support costs, report outlays since those fundsare usually spent relatively quickly. Readers of these options may also want to consult a re \u0010 cent CBO study, The Long\u0010Term Implications of Current Defense Plans (January 2003). That report takes a com \u0010 prehensive look at the long \u0010term implications of the Bush Administration's plans for defense. It projects what levelof resources might be needed to execute those plans andwhat the plans would imply about the size, composition,and age of future U.S. forces if they were carried out.CHAPTER TWO FUNCTION 050: NATIONAL DEFENSE 11 050-01\u2014Discretionary Cancel Remaining Purchases of the Javelin Missile Total (Millions of dollars) 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2004-2008 2004-2013 Savings Budget authority 174 142 9 116 1 441 441Outlays 50 107 92 78 60 387 439 The Javelin missile was originally designed to counter the Soviet Union's heavily armored tanks. About 20,000 were produced from 1997 through 2003, at an average cost of about $160,000 apiece. Close to 4,000 more are due to be bought between 2004 and 2007, at an average cost of $125,000 apiece. The Congress, the General Accounting Office, and the Defense Department's Inspector General have all expressed skepticism about the con \u0010 tinued, essentially unchanged investment in antitank munitions despite the significant changes in the threat since the end of the Cold War. Whereas potential targets numbered about 25,000 at the height of the Cold War, they now number fewer than 4,000. The Army's current stated requirement for Javelin missiles stands at almost 35,000, including the amount needed for the new medium \u0010weight Stryker brigades (also termed the interim brigade combat teams). However, the actual planned purchase is 23,850, partly reflecting the Army's acknowledgment of the limited number of Javelins that simulations have indicated would be fired at enemy tanks and other vehicles during a war\u2014both because of the number of potential targets and the many other weapons with longer ranges that would be employed to fight a war. Despite the reduction, the Army's planned purchase of Javelin missiles would provide a number sufficient to fight 75 major theater wars. For other munitions, the Army buys enough for about 10 major theater wars, ac \u0010 counting for wartime usage, training, and other needs. The Javelin overcomes several significant problems that its pre \u0010 decessor, the Dragon, had. That missile presented dangers at its launch and had to be manually guided to its intended target and therefore exposed the soldier using it to enemy counterfire. In contrast, the Javelin uses a \"soft launch\" (its motor igniting after the missile is ejected from the launch unit) and then guides itself to the intended target. Perhaps because of the Dragon'sproblems, the Army intends to use more than a third of the Javelin missiles, about 9,000, as \"confidence rounds\" fired by trainers to demonstrate to trainees that the missiles actually work. But that approach is unique to Javelin\u2014for no other U.S. munition are confidence rounds used as a basis for the required inventory. Eliminating the requirement for those confidence rounds and paring the extra missiles required for the maintenance pipeline would reduce the required number of Javelins to about 14,000, well below the 2003 inventory of about 20, 000. Therefore, this option would cancel the remaining purchases but would leave the Army with an inventory sufficient for all of its needs, including equipping the Stryker brigades. The option would save $50 million in outlays in 2004 and $387 million over the 2004\u00102008 period. Several arguments have been raised in support of continuing to purchase Javelin missiles. First, the Army's greater emphasis on light and medium \u0010weight forces, including the Stryker brigades, makes Javelin more important now as both an offen \u0010 sive and defensive weapon because it provides such units with tank\u0010destroying capability that they otherwise might not have. Second, because one cannot predict which units may actually expend their Javelins even if ov erall use is expected to be low, keeping a robust maintenance pipeline is a prudent hedge. Third, although having confidence rounds is a unique require \u0010 ment for munitions, they are necessary to counteract the nega \u0010 tive legacy of the Dragon. Finally, the Defense Security Coop \u0010 eration Agency has notified the Congress that sales of the Javelin have been negotiated with Taiwan, and sales to the United Kingdom, Australia, Jordan, and Lithuania are being discussed. Canceling the remainder of the U.S. Army's purchases of Javelins could negatively affect those sales.

In 1996, the Army implemented two reorganizations of field artillery units almost simultaneously. Batteries of 155 \u0010 millimeter cannons in the artillery battalions were re \u0010 duced from eight howitzers per battery to six. Batteries of multiple \u0010launch rocket systems were reduced from nine launchers to six. At the division level, the reduction in firepower was approximately 30 percent. At the same time, the number of artillery brigades in the corps sup \u0010 porting each heavy division was increased from one to two. The effect was to distribute essentially the same amount of combat power among a larger number of units, substantially expanding headquarters units and staff and increasing fixed costs. This option would reverse those reorganizations to what existed during Operation Desert Storm. Doing so would decentralize the command structure, thereby lessening the distance between fire control centers and the intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance functions and perhaps allowing quicker decisions on the battlefield. Those changes would save $196 milli on in outlays in 2004 and $2.1 billion over the 2004 \u00102008 period.Reversing the reorganizations would result in an overall reduction of approximatel y 12,000 personnel within the Army. Of those, 5,000 are active \u0010duty personnel and 7,000 are reservists. In both p ools, the proportion of per \u0010 sonnel who are midranking offi cers is heavy, and noted shortages of midranking officers and unusually high promotion rates that have followed those shortages could be addressed by adopting this option. Because the earlier reorganizations occurred over a two \u0010year period, this option would adopt the same amount of time for revers \u0010 ing them. Importantly, the option would cut administra \u0010 tive overhead without cutting \"tooth.\" After two years and the reduction in personnel, savings would be ap \u0010 proximately half a billion dollars annually. But several arguments support the current organizational structure. For example, the artillery battalions that resulted from the reorganizations are lighter than the previous ones by about 25 percent and therefore are in accord with the widely agreed \u0010upon goal of lightening the Army and making its operational units more deployable. Moreover, thanks partly to improvements in command, control, and intelligence, the higher number of head \u0010 quarters personnel may be able to help commanders apply their firepower effectively across a wider area.

The first element of that plan, called the objective force, is a long \u0010term research effort to develop weapon systems with substantial combat power that can be deployed rapidly. The second element of the plan, called the interim force, is a near \u0010term effort to convert six Army brigades into a medium \u0010weight configuration. The two efforts are complementary, since the Army's experience with the interim force is intended to let the Army experiment with new ways of warfighting and new ways of organizing units that may prove useful for the ob \u0010 jective force. Ultimately, the Army envisions converting all of its divisions to objective force units. The Army's plans for the interim force are centered on the Stryker program, which intends to rapidly field a family of light armored vehicles capable of filling most of the combat roles in a brigade. The Army's goal is for the interim brigades equipped with Stryker vehicles to be light enough to deploy by air anywhere in the world within 96 hours and robust enough to handle the full range of combat missions. Converting each brigade to that configuration will cost about $1.5 billion, the Con \u0010 gressional Budget Office estimates. About two \u0010thirds of that cost will be for procuring slightly more than 300 Strykers per brigade. The Stryker vehicle has, however, attracted criticism. With less armor than some current fighting vehicles, it may not be as survivable on the battlefield as today's heavy forces. Moreover, the vehicle is too large and tooheavy to be easily transported in the Air Force's C \u0010130 transport planes and thus will not be as easy to deploy as the Army had initially hoped that it would be. This option would reduce the number of interim brigades from six to three and reduce the procurement of Stryker vehicles accordingly, saving $2.4 billion in outlays over the next five years. Proponents of this option note that the interim force is intended to be only a stepping \u0010stone to the Army's future objective force. They argue that the three brigades that would be converted for the interim force would be suf \u0010 ficient to allow the Army to experiment with new ways of fighting, and the lower number of conversions would reduce the resources expended on what some people would characterize as a short \u0010term expedient. Opponents of this option contend that the Army's plan for the objective force is risky and may not be affordable and that conversions to the objective force are not sched \u0010 uled to begin until 2008. In contrast, they say, the Stryker program has been executed rapidly, with little risk, and at a relatively low cost. Thus, the interim brigades could provide useful capabilities much sooner than the objective force will. Further, opponents argue, because most of the units that the Army plans to convert are light units, the Army will, in fact, increase its net combat power through the conversions, even though the Stryker may be less survivable than the fighting vehicles in heavy units. Finally, critics of this option note, although the Stryker vehicle cannot be easily transported by C \u0010130s, it can be easily carried in C \u00105s or C\u001017s, the transpor t aircraft used for strategic deployments.

The centerpiece of the objective force is the Future Combat System (FCS) program, which has the goal of developing a combination of ground and air platforms, linked together with advanced communica \u0010 tions networks into an integrated combat system. Because the FCS program is still evolving, its full costs are not yet known; they are, however, li kely to be more than $22 bil \u0010 lion through 2009, according to the Army's most recent budget plan. Such an effort carries with it substantial risks, including the need to develop many advanced new technologies. Furthermore, despite the lack of a firm cost estimate, the Army currently plans to field the FCS in 2008. Many external observers and technical experts believe that such a schedule is too aggressive, given the program's ambi \u0010 tious goals. This option would delay the planned fielding date of the FCS by two years and reduce funding accordingly. That delay would reduce outlays by about $4 billion over the next five years. Proponents of this option argue that the current program, with its many unknowns and technological risks, is likely to slip anyway within the ne xt few years and that its overly aggressive schedule could diminish its chances for success. Since it is unlikely that many of the technologies that the Army is considering using in the FCS will bemature by the time production begins, an aggressive schedule may result in otherwise achievable capabilities being sacrificed to meet the fielding date. The funding that would be diverted from the FCS under this option could be used to convert additional Stryker brigades, but that would reduce the option's savings. Those brigades, serving as stepping stones to the objective force, are intended to help the Army develop the new doctrine and methods of warfighting that are described as crucial to the objective force's success. Since those in \u0010 terim brigades will share many organizational features with objective force units, they also could serve as an em \u0010 bryonic objective force, providing a test environment for its new equipment and integrated approach to combat. The Army's transformation could thus be a more gradual and evolutionary process, with fewer risks. Opponents of this option argue that transforming the Army into the objective force is the most important effort under way in the service's modernization and should be pursued as quickly as possible. Although defenders of the FCS program are likely to concede that it faces technical challenges, they see the aggressive schedule as motivation that inspires the FCS team to search for ways to overcom e those challenges. They believe that delaying the FCS pro \u0010 gram will send a signal that the rapid transformation of the Army is not vital, threatening the bureaucratic and institutional momentum needed to sustain such a major set of changes. They also note that the longer the FCS is delayed, the more funding the Army will have to expend to recapitalize and sustain its existing fleet of aging platforms.

In 1982, the Army had planned to replace some of those older scout, attack, and utility helicopters with more than 5,000 new Comanche (RAH\u001066) helicopters. However, the Comanche has had a troubled development program. The utility version of the helicopter wa s dropped in 1988 be cause the program had become too cost ly. In 1990, the size of the already \u0010 reduced planned purchase was cut from more than 2,000 aircraft to just under 1,300. La ter, the Army delayed the projected start of produc tion from 1996 to 2005. In 2002, the Army sought to exte nd the engineering and manufacturing development phase of the program by another two years. Subsequent restructuring of the pro \u0010 gram delayed the planned start of an initial operational capability by a year to 2009. It also eliminated the attack mission from the Comanche's primary requirements. As a consequence, the planned purchase has been halved to 650 aircraft, and reconnaissanc e remains the only primary mission. Those changes have caused the average procurement cost per helicopter to more than double since the program be \u0010 gan\u2014from $11.5 million in 1985 to $25.1 million in 2002 (in 2003 dollars). With th at cost growth, the Co \u0010 manche is now more expensive than the Army's Apache (AH\u001064) attack helicopter, even though it was developed to be less costly to buy, operate, and maintain. Moreover, prior to the reduction to 650 aircraft, the General Ac \u0010 counting Office and the Department of Defense's Inspec \u0010 tor General stated that costs could grow by as much as another 30 percent. This option would cancel the Comanche program and instead buy 850 Predator B unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for the Army's scout and reconnaissance mis \u0010 sions, beginning in 2007. The additional 200 vehicleswould provide reserves for attrition. If the Army config \u0010 ured its UAVs like the Air Force's, with the same distri \u0010 bution of ground control stations, sensors, and com \u0010 munications, the average cost per vehicle would be $7 million in 2003 dollars. If the Army selected a leaner configuration than the Air Force, relying more on line \u0010of\u0010 sight communications or procuring fewer sensors, the unit cost would be less. To field the scouting capability rapidly, this option would buy the UAVs at the contrac \u0010 tor's maximum rate of 100 per year, about 60 percent faster than the rate of production for the Comanche. At a procurement rate of 100 pe r year, more than 550 would be produced by 2013. Net sa vings would total $589 mil \u0010 lion in outlays in 2004 and almost $6 billion over the 2004\u00102008 period. The primary advantage of the Comanche over existing rotary aircraft is its sophisticated stealth, avionics, and aeronautics technologies. In the interim, canceling it might require the Army to increase its reliance on older rotary airframes or iginally designed in the 1960s and 1970s. However, some analysts argue that the Comanche, which was conceived at the height of the Cold War, will no longer face threats of the same scale or sophistication as those for which it was designed. Whether it really does have a unique role to play in Army aviation is unclear. With or without Comanche, the Army is planning to use Apaches in both scouting and attack roles for the next 15 to 20 years, as it did successfully during the Persian Gulf War. The Army also used Kiowa Warriors in the Persian Gulf both as scouts for Apaches and as light attack aircraft. Many of the Kiowa Warriors have undergone substantial upgrades since then. Moreover, the Army has already used less capable UAVs than the Predator B for some scouting functions. In Kosovo and Afghanistan, U.S. forces used UAVs effectively as scouts, without the risk of losing aircrews. In addition, the evolution of capa \u001016 BUDGET OPTIONS bilities for the Predator B platform is expected to be very rapid, including the development of an attack system, which remains a secondary requirement for the Coman \u0010che. Finally, if the Comanche program were canceled, some of the savings could be used to fund a program to continue developing advanced helicopter technologies.

Subsequently, the Department of Defense decided that 55 submarines would be the goal, meeting both the minimum peacetime and wartime force levels identified in the study. To modernize its submarine force, the Navy plans to buy one Virginia class sub per year from 2003 to 2007 and two or three per year between 2008 and 2013. At the same time, it plans to retire early two Los Angeles class submarines in 2004 and 2005. Those subs would still have years of useful life remaining, however, if their nuclear reactors were refueled. This option would refuel the reactors to keep those Los Angeles class submarines in service. Under the option, the Navy would procure 10 Virg inia class submarines, 11 fewer than planned. In addition, the option would make permanent the Navy's plan to temporarily base three sub \u0010 marines in Guam and would also transfer six additional submarines there by 2012 to take advantage of being 3,300 nautical miles closer to their operating areas. Those changes would cost $240 million in budget authority in 2004 but would save about $5.9 billion in budget author \u0010 ity over five years. To help bridge the gap between force levels and require \u0010 ments, the Navy announced in 2001 that it would begin basing three attack submar ines in Guam by early 2004. By moving those ships 3,300 naut ical miles west of Pearl Harbor and employing an operating concept different from the one used for subs based in Hawaii or the conti \u0010 nental United States, the Navy can get about three times the number of mission days from Guam \u0010based SSNs asfrom other SSNs. However, the attack submarines being transferred to Guam will reach the end of their service life around 2015, and the Navy ha s not said whether they will then be replaced by ot her submarines. Basing nine attack submarines in Guam indefinitely, as this option describes, would require the construction of additional infrastructure on Guam to make the submarine facilities there equivalent to a submarine base. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the cost for that infrastructure to be around $200 million to $300 million. This option would maintain a force of at least 55 SSNs through 2015, equivalent in th e number of mission days they could perform to a force of 74 attack submarines (including 19 Virginia class) based only in the United States. Under the Navy's plan, the force would have 59 attack submarines by 2015, in cluding 15 Virginia class, but would provide mission days equivalent to only 61 SSNs because two of the Guam \u0010based submarines would have retired. (If the Navy replaced those two with new Virginia class subs, the force would provide mission days equivalent to 65 SSNs, including 19 Virginias.) Proponents would argue that in addition to saving money, this option would be highly cost \u0010effective. Attack submarines are expensive capital assets that perform a variety of missions, many of them covert. Although SSNs cost around $2.0 billion dolla rs apiece (in 2002 dollars), they spend an average of 36 days per year\u2014or 10 percent of their service life\u2014on \u0010station performing missions. Like other Navy ships, SSNs spend the rest of their service life in training missions, port calls, transit, and maintenance. Consequently, the cost per additional mission day per year provided by building a new attack submarine is $2.718 BUDGET OPTIONS million (in 2002 dollars). Bu t the cost per additional mission day of transferring an SSN to Guam is only $0.2 million. This option would have several disadvantages, however. First, with fewer submarines based in San Diego and Pearl Harbor, having SSNs to train with carrier battle groups and thus support them during their deployments may be more difficult. Atta ck submarines would also be less available to assist other Navy units, such as ones prac \u0010 ticing antisubmarine warfare. Second, because existing submarines are less capable than new Virginia class submarines, an attack submarine force with fewer Virginias might be somewhat less capable of prosecuting a war. However, that difference would prob \u0010 ably matter only if the United States fought a sophisti \u0010 cated opponent with potent antisubmarine warfare capa \u0010 a potential difficulty with this option\u2014as with the Navy's decision to base three submarines in Guam\u2014is the quality of life for sailors and their families on that island. Guam does not offer the same homesteading opportunities as submarine bases in San Diego and Pearl Harbor do. At those large bases, it is relatively easy for members of a submarine crew to find other jobs in the Navy when they finish their sea tours. Thus, they and their families can put down roots and stay in one place longer than a few years. Such opportunities are few in Guam. In addition, the spouses of sailors have fewer opportunities to find jobs there. Still, if the Navy found that Guam \u0010based duty led to much lower levels of re \u0010 tention for submariners, monetary bonuses might help. Even large annual incentives for each member of a sub \u0010 marine's crew would not significantly change this op \u0010 tion's cost \u0010effectiveness.

The destroyer, which is expected to carry about 130 missiles and one or two advanced gun systems, is being designed principally to attack targets on land, although it will be able to perform other missions. A small ship, the LCS is expected to counter either diesel \u0010electric submarines; mines; or small fast attack craft in coastal regions\u2014 missions for which the Navy would prefer to not use a large ship like the new destroyer. Although the Navy has not formally announced how many of each type of ship it will purchase, some Department of Defense (DoD) officials have indicated that the service intends to buy 16 of the new destroyers and about 60 littoral combat ships. The total cost of purchasing 16 DDXs would be about $35 billion, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates. Buying up to 60 LCSs would add to those costs substantially. This option would scrap the plans to build a new de \u0010 stroyer and littoral combat ship in favor of building a new frigate, a ship that would be considerably smaller than the DDX but larger and more capable than the LCS. Relative to the plans outlined in DoD's 2003 Future Years De \u0010 fense Program, this option would save about $11 billion in budget authority be tween 2004 and 2008. Those sav \u0010 ings do not include money from canceling the LCS, be \u0010 cause that program was not included in the 2003 Future Years Defense Program, so the actual savings from this option would be substantia lly higher. (CBO did not include savings from research and development funding as a result of canceling the DDX because, according to the Navy, many of the new technologies being developed for that ship would eventually be used in other ship programs, including the future carrier, the Virginia classsubmarine, and the future cruiser. CBO assumed that the new frigate would incorporate them as well.) Under this option, the Navy would initially purchase 17 multimission frigates thro ugh 2013 and eventually buy a total of 40. Over the long term, buying 40 frigates would completely offset the savings from not buying the 16 DDXs. If the Navy chose, it could use the savings from canceling the littoral combat ship to buy even more frigates. The DDX is a ship that appears to be designed for major wars. With a reported di splacement of 13,000 to 16,000 tons, it would be larger than any other surface combatant in the Navy. In addition to the missiles, its other major weapon system would be one or two 155 \u0010millimeter advanced guns to provide fire support to the Marine Corps up to 100 nautical miles away. Supporters of this option would argue, however, that the most likely maritime challenges that the United States and its allies will face include terrorism, drug smuggling, violations of economic sanctions, illegal immigration, and arms trafficking. The DDX would be an exceptionally large and expensive ship to fulfill those missions. Ironically, although a smaller warship would seem to make more sense to perform those missions, the littoral combat ship that Navy offici als describe does not appear to be well suited for them . The LCS would be a single \u0010 mission ship with a modular combat system, which would be tailored to the mission that the ship was ex \u0010 pected to take on. If it was being sent to counter mines, it would have a mine countermeasures payload. If it was being sent to counter diesel \u0010electric submarines, it would have an antisubmarine warfare suite. However, counter \u0010 ing mines might be better performed by ships dedicated20 BUDGET OPTIONS to the task, and countering submarines might be better done with submarines, as the Navy has thought since the Cold War. Similarly, the LCS does not seem particularly well suited to counter small, fast attack boats. Although the most effective weapon against such boats has been the helicopter, the LCS would at most be able to carry, oper \u0010 ate, and sustain one medium \u0010sized helicopter (rather than the two that today's frigates and destroyers can accommo \u0010 date), nor would the LCS be fast enough in its own right to hunt down high \u0010speed enemy boats. That deficiency might prove to be especially important since such boats are the most likely weapons for terrorists to use to attack U.S. Navy ships. A new frigate would cost about twice as much as a littoral combat ship, CBO estimates. But in return for that money, the ship would be capable of performing multiple missions at the same time\u2014including countering mines, submarines, and small boat s\u2014and would have a robust capability to defend itself. Canceling the DDX program would have a number of disadvantages, however. First, the program is perhaps the most innovative in the Navy. The destroyer is intended to have a completely new design; to use a new, efficientpower system; and to operate with a relatively small crew. Other development programs in the Navy are expected to benefit from the research and innovation being pur \u0010 sued in the DDX program. Restructuring that program could disrupt and slow the process of innovation in ship design for the Navy for several years, although many of the technologies being developed for the DDX could be used effectively in the new frigate. Second, fire support for the Marine Corps would suffer in the absence of the DDX destroyer. The largest gun in the Navy today has a calibe r of five inches. The 155 mm gun on the DDX (slightly larger than a six \u0010inch gun) would provide better fire support for amphibious land \u0010 ings and Marine operations ashore. The 155 \u0010millimeter guns would have a much longer range and be three times as powerful as the current five \u0010inch guns. However, it has been more than 10 years since a Navy ship carried a larger gun. During the Gulf War, the war against Serbia, and the operation to overthrow the Taliban in Afghanistan, as well as in numerous smaller military operations, any need for a larger naval gun was not plain. Furthermore, improvements in missile technology as well as the larger payloads that new Navy and Marine strike aircraft, such as the Joint Strike Fighter, will carry could make a larger gun unnecessary.

The Navy has bought 10 of the ships, each one being tech \u0010 nologically a little better than its predecessor. Now, how \u0010 ever, the Navy argues that the Nimitz's design, its propul \u0010 sion system, and its power systems have nearly reached the limits of their usefulness for the future. Under the 2003 Future Years Defense Program (FYDP), the Navy planned to make a series of evolutionary upgrades to the Nimitz design so that, after three or four more ships, essentially a new class of carrier would exist. Under the 2004 FYDP, however, the Navy plans to incorporate all of the elements of the new design into the first new car \u0010 rier (the CVN \u001021), to be authorized in 2007. The Navy's intent behind that change is to accelerate the arrival of new capabilities in the carrier fleet, although it will also make that first new ship much more expensive. Under the previous plan, the development of a new class of aircraft carrier began with the CVN \u001077, ordered in 2001, with some relatively minor improvements and reductions in crew size. That ship is still considered part of the Nimitz class. The first of the new carriers, to be ordered in 2007, was designated as the CVNX \u00101 to indi\u0010 cate that it was the start of a new class of aircraft carrier and represented the most dr amatic change from the Nimitz. The CVNX \u00101 would have received a new, more efficient, less manpower \u0010intensive nuclear reactor; a new electrical power grid; and an electromagnetic catapult for launching aircraft. The Navy had hoped that those changes would dramatically in crease the power available on the ship; free up weight that could be available forother things; and, especially, lead to a smaller crew and a reduction in the total ownership cost of the ship class. The CVNX \u00102, the carrier that the Navy had hoped to order in 2011, would then have had additional improve \u0010 ments, such as further reductions in crew size as well as improvements to the flight deck and hull in order to increase the number of sorties flown off the carrier in a 24\u0010hour period. Rather than pursue all of those new technologies for the CVN\u001021, this option would elim inate the research and development funding that was designated for the CVNX \u0010 2 and thereby force the Navy to build a second CVNX \u00101. Doing so would save almost $900 million in outlays between 2004 and 2013, although most of those savings would come in the latter half of the period. The Navy argues that it needs a new class of aircraft car \u0010 rier because the reactor for the Nimitz class does not gen \u0010 erate much excess power, making it difficult to incor \u0010 porate new weapons or combat systems. Thus, pursuing the CVNX \u00101, which this option does, would solve that problem and improve reliability, survivability, and main \u0010 tainability. But building a CVNX \u00101 (or CVN \u001021) would not clearly yield a substantial advance in capabilities over a second CVNX \u00101. Navy carriers today are already far more capable in terms of the number of strike sorties they can launch and the number of targets they can hit in a 24\u0010hour period than they were 10 years ago. Further \u0010 more, although additional savings from more reductions in crew size might be possible, they would not be realized for many decades.

The Marine Corps plans to buy a total of 360 of the planes. (The Air Force may eventually buy 50 V \u001022s for its special \u0010 operations forces, and the Navy plans to buy 48 V \u001022s for combat search \u0010and\u0010rescue missions and for logistics support of its fleet.) The V \u001022 can transport more than 20 Marines or about 10,000 poun ds of their equipment from ship to shore. The plane's tilt \u0010rotor technology en \u0010 ables it to take off and land vertically as a helicopter does and, by tilting its rotor assemblies into a horizontal posi \u0010 tion, to become a propeller \u0010driven airplane when in for \u0010 ward flight. As a result, the V \u001022 can fly faster than con \u0010 ventional helicopters. The Marine Corps argues that the plane's increased speed and other design features make it less vulnerable than other aircraft when flying over enemy terrain and enable it to provide over \u0010the\u0010horizon amphibious assault capability\u2014which minimizes the ex \u0010 posure of amphibious ships to coastal fire and increases tactical surprise by obscuring the destination of the at \u0010 tack. In addition, the V \u001022 is designed to fly longer dis \u0010 tances without refueling than conventional helicopters do. Thus, it can fly directly to distant theaters, whereas many helicopters must be transported there on planes or ships. Despite those advantages, critics of the V \u001022 have ques \u0010 tioned whether the new aircraft will demonstrate enough improved capabilities to justify its higher cost. Each V \u001022 is expected to cost abou t $72 million (in 2003 dollars), or significantly more than the Marine Corps's conven \u0010 tional helicopters. A November 2000 report by the Direc \u0010 tor of Operational Testing and Evaluation in the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) expressed concern about whether the V \u001022 would actually be able to takeoff and land quickly enough to have a higher survival rate than that of current helicopters. That report also raised concern about the V \u001022's low rate of availability (which results when planes break down frequently or take a long time to fix). According to the report, the V \u001022s that were tested were ready to perform their missions (that is, were mission capable) only 36 percent to 57 percent of the time, in contrast to the Marine Corps's desired rate of 82 percent. By comparison, the Army's Blackhawk had a mission\u0010capable rate of about 80 percent, on average, in the past, and even the aging CH \u001046 helicopter, which the V\u001022 is intended to replace, had a rate of 79 percent. The Marine Corps argues that many of the problems leading to the low availability cited in that study have been solved. Nonetheless, if availability proved low, the V \u001022's cost\u0010effectiveness would be significantly reduced. Despite the concerns raised in the report, the study endorsed con \u0010 tinued flight \u0010testing for the V \u001022, although it recom \u0010 mended that testing be completed before the V \u001022 was deployed. The greatest concerns about the V \u001022 program relate to the plane's safety. Of the 17 V \u001022s that were bought for developmental flight \u0010testing or allocated to operational flight\u0010testing, three (or 18 percent) have been lost. A fourth V\u001022 was lost on a routine training flight, not as part of flight \u0010testing. (A tilt \u0010rotor predecessor of the plane also crashed.) The percentage of V \u001022s lost during testing is much lower than the 50 percent loss rate experienced by the Marine Corps's CH \u001053 helicopter during its testing and almost equal to the 17 percent loss rate during testing of the Blackhawk and the Army's early \u0010model Apache attack helicopter. However, none of the proto \u0010 types of the S \u001092 (a commercial transport helicopter developed by the Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation) or the SH\u001060 (a seagoing variant of the Blackhawk) have crashed.CHAPTER TWO FUNCTION 050: NATIONAL DEFENSE 23 If the Department of Defense (DoD) canceled the pro \u0010 gram altogether, DoD might instead buy conventional helicopters for the Marine Corps.

This option assumes that DoD would buy a total of 360 S\u001092s for the Marine Corps and 48 S \u001092s for the Navy in place of an equal number of V \u001022s. (Only 215 of those S\u001092s would be purchased through 2013, however \u2014163 fewer than the number of V \u001022s that would have been bought by then under Do D's 2003 plan. The slower ac \u0010 quisition occurs because modifying the S \u001092 for maritime missions and testing the plane are assumed to take several years.) The S \u001092 can transport roughly the same number of troops and carry about the same amount of weight ex \u0010 ternally as the V \u001022 can. Purchasing S \u001092s for the Navy's search\u0010and\u0010rescue mission would provide commonality with the Marine Corps's aircraft and could also provide commonality with the Air Force's since the S \u001092 is a candidate to perform that service's search \u0010and\u0010rescue mis \u0010 sion as well. (OSD may also be considering purchasing an improved version of the UH \u00101, a utility helicopter already in the Marine Corps's helicopter fleet. That plane might be used to augment the capabilities of the V \u001022 if replacing all of the CH \u001046s became too expensive. Or OSD might substitute a combination of CH \u001053Es and UH\u00101s for the V \u001022s if the latter continued to experience safety problems.) Some analyses of al ternatives to the V \u001022 have suggested that more than one helicopter would need to be pur \u0010 chased to replace the lift capability lost from cutting the number of V \u001022s that DoD had planned to buy. Con \u0010sequently, under this option, DoD would buy additional helicopters, specifically 80 CH \u001053s from 2008 through 2013. The Marine Corps would buy CH \u001053s that incor \u0010 porated a number of improvements over the CH \u001053Es in the fleet today. Buying just 10 of the improved CH \u0010 53s would add the capacity to transport another 360,000 pounds of equipment or 550 troops. Together with the S\u001092s, those CH \u001053s would provide almost as much cap \u0010 ability as the planned fleet of V \u001022s. The option would save nearly $400 million in 2004 and $6.1 billion over five years, the Congressional Budget Office estimates. Opponents of the V \u001022 cancellation might point out that conventional helicopters cannot perform amphibious operations as quickly or as safely as the V \u001022 can. Because the aircraft can fly faster and carry more equipment (or carry it longer distances) than helicopters can, Marine forces with V \u001022s could build up combat power ashore \u2014especially from long distances\u2014more quickly than forces with helicopters could. As a result, amphibious as \u0010 saults relying on V \u001022s could prove less risky. Similarly, slower helicopters could present a target for ground \u0010to\u0010air missiles over longer periods, and some types, including perhaps the S \u001092s, might have areas vulnerable to small \u0010 arms fire that were larg er than those of the V \u001022s. In addition, unlike the V \u001022s, the helicopters purchased under this option might not be able to self \u0010deploy (fly from their base directly to a theater of operations rather than be partially disassembled and carried on transport aircraft). They also lack other improvements the Marine Corps hopes to gain with the V \u001022s, including systems that give pilots better information about potential threats. This option also assumes that no V \u001022s are bought for the Air Force, since that service probably would not pur \u0010 sue the V\u001022 program alone. (Indeed, procurement of V \u0010 22s for the Air Force has been delayed while awaiting the outcome of the current test program.) Although the op \u0010 tion assumes that the Navy would substitute S \u001092s for the V\u001022s it intended to buy, the option does not include a replacement for those Air Force planes. The savings from this option would be lower if such replacements were procured.24 BUDGET OPTIONS 050-10\u2014Discretionary Reduce Purchases of the Air Force's F/A-22 Fighter Total (Millions of dollars) 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2004-2008 2004-2013 Savings Budget authority 0 8 1,044 The F/A\u001022, under development as the Air Force's next premier fighter aircraft, is scheduled to begin replacing the older F \u001015 fighter soon. But the program has experienced repeated delays and increases in cost duringthe more than 20 years that the Department of Defense (DoD) has discussed a replacement for the F \u001015. This option would decrease the planned purchase of F/A \u001022s by 156 planes, thereby saving a total of $8.2 billion in budget authority through 2008. The Air Force originally planned to buy more than 800 F/A\u001022s. After a series of cu ts, the 2003 plan would have bought only 295 aircraft\u2014alm ost enough for three air wings. Press reports indicate that the Administration will buy fewer planes\u2014perhaps 276 through the end of the program. If the Air Force cuts its purchases to that num \u0010 ber, it will have to pay $146 million apiece for the F/A \u0010 22, the Congressional Budget Office estimates. Althoughthe F/A\u001022 has a number of improvements in capability over other fighters, its cost makes it the most expensivefighter ever built. The F/A\u001022 is the only new tactical fighter program to survive from the Cold War period. (The other two fighters that DoD is planning\u2014the joint service F \u001035 and the Navy's F/A \u0010 18E/F\u2014entered development after 1990. They are likely to be both less capable and less expensive than the F/A \u001022, although they may face many of the same threats.) The F/A \u001022's sophistication and cost, plus concerns about whether it will actually realize promised improvements in capability, have led some analysts to suggest that the F/A \u001022 is a legacy of the Cold War\u2014a plane designed to fight many sophisticated Soviet fightersrather than the modest regional fighter forces that it ismore likely to encounter today. Such critics recommend canceling the program, or at least cutting planned pro \u0010 curement further. In its report on its fiscal year 2000 defense appropriation bill, the defense subcommittee of the House Committee on Appropriations expressed concerns about the plane's cost and capability. The Senate concurred and the Con \u0010 gress directed DoD to complete testing of the F/A \u001022 before spending funds on production. The Air Force indicates that it has successfully completed all of the testing ordered by the Congress, and it seems likely to move the program into the next phase of production. Some proponents of this option might argue that the Air Force could reduce production quantities to a total of 120 F/A\u001022s, enough to let the service field one air wing of the sophisticated fighters. Such a \"silver \u0010bullet\" pur \u0010 chase would allow the Air Force to learn lessons about producing aircraft of the F/A \u001022's technological complex \u0010 ity but might still leave enough planes to perform themissions for which the service needs the F/A \u001022's degree of stealth and other performance advantages. One possible disadvantage of this option is that it would make the Air Force's fighter fleet, which is already aging under current plans, even older. However, buying F \u001015s to make up for the cut in F/A \u001022s would remedy that problem (although it would reduce the savings from this option). The F \u001015 is much less capable than the F/A \u001022, but it is far more capable than the fighters of almost anyof the United States' regional adversaries.

A team of several manufacturers led by the Lockheed Mar \u0010 tin Aeronautics Company was awarded a contract in 2002 to develop three versions of the aircraft: an inexpen \u0010 sive multirole fighter \u0010range, stealthy ground \u0010attack plane for the Navy; and a short \u0010 takeoff/vertical \u0010landing fighter for the Marine Corps. Together, those planes account for two \u0010thirds of the fighter aircraft that the military expects to buy through 2020 and roughly two \u0010thirds of the spending on new tactical fighters, the Congressional Budget Office esti \u0010 mates. Their procurement costs are expected to total $147 billion in budget au thority (in 2003 dollars) through the end of the F \u001035 program, according to the Administration's estimates. This option would defer purchase of the first F \u001035s until 2008\u2014two years later than th e Department of Defense (DoD) now plans. A slowdown in development and pro \u0010 duction would give the program more time to clear devel \u0010 opment hurdles and would decrease outlays by $3 billion over the next five years. The slowdown would save $17 billion through 2013 becaus e DoD would purchase 412 fewer planes through that year. The F\u001035's development could prove very challenging. Variants of the aircraft are intended to perform signifi \u0010 cantly different missions, although the planes themselves are expected to have much in common. F \u001035s are also supposed to be more capable than the aircraft they replace but only slightly more expensive, if at all. Addressing those seemingly inconsistent goals at the same time could take longer than the program manager and contractors now envision.In addition, the program's schedule is tight compared with that of the only other full \u0010fledged development pro \u0010 gram for a fighter in recent years, the Air Force's F/A \u001022 air\u0010superiority aircraft. The F \u001035 became a major defense acquisition program in May 1996; the first formal review took place in 2001, when th e program entered the sys \u0010 tems development and demonstration phase. The F \u001035 is scheduled to en ter production in 2006, just five years after significant development began and 10 years after the beginning of the program. The F/A \u001022 program, by con \u0010 trast, has already been running for about 15 years and may take more time before it jumps its last developmen \u0010 tal hurdles. Although the schedule for the F \u001035 is about 80 percent longer than that for another fighter, the Navy's F/A \u001018E/F, that program n eeded only to modify an existing aircraft. The F\u001035 program has already experienced delays. The demonstration phase and sele ction of a contractor team took about a year longer than the program had originally projected. Even longer delays might be associated with the next stage of development since it is much more chal \u0010 lenging than the demonstration phase. Slowing the schedule of the F \u001035 program would mean that DoD would have to adapt its future plans for tactical fighter fleets. For example, if DoD had to wait longer for F\u001035s, it might keep the production lines of current \u0010 generation aircraft open longer than it now plans. Also, anticipating delays in the F \u001035 program might result in DoD's modifying current aircraft to make them last longer. Opponents of slowing the schedule for F \u001035s could cite a number of concerns. Any up \u0010front savings from length \u001026 BUDGET OPTIONS ening the program, they might argue, would be offset by higher total costs. In addition, delays would make DoD's fighters (on average already mu ch older than in the past) grow even older before they were replaced. As a result,DoD could have to pay modification costs that it would otherwise avoid and would have fewer fighters available as they underwent age \u0010related repairs. Conversely, pursuing development at a more measuredpace might result in savings. A delay might permit DoD to avoid producing aircraft before the design was com \u0010 plete and to avoid costly retrofits. It also might allowDoD and the services to develop production schedules that were m ore realistic. Costs can be much higher if con \u0010 tractors build facilities with production capacity in excessof what is needed for the maximum production rate\u2014a risk that can exist with aggressive production schedules.

For instance, unmanned Predators, armed with Hellfire missiles, have directed manned fighters to enemy targets and even attacked Taliban targets them \u0010 selves. The Department of Defense (DoD) has several programs that are slated to develop unmanned combat air vehicles (UCAVs)\u2014armed unmanned aircraft\u2014from scratch. A prototype of the Air Force's UCAV, the X \u001045, flew earlier this year. Production versions of that aircraft are supposed to become operational around the end of this decade. This option would cut a manned F \u001035 (formerly known as the Joint Strike Fighter) for every 1.1 UCAVs de \u0010 ployed, to reflect the ratio of the currently projected payloads of the two aircraft. That substitution would leave the Air Force's total capacity to deliver munitions unchanged. The Air Force is currently scheduled to in \u0010 crease annual production of F \u001035s from six planes in 2006 to 110 by 2012. For this option, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) assumed that purchases would be slowed and that peak production of F \u001035s would equal only 72 planes per year. Thus, this option would replace 114 F\u001035s with 126 UCAVs over the 2004 \u00102013 period, saving $2.5 billion in outl ays through 2013 (although almost no savings would appear during the next five years). Last year, DoD submitted detailed plans for UCAVs only through 2007, the end point of the 2003 Future Years Defense Program, although the services or program offices that oversee such weapons development possessed tentative schedules beyond that period. Under those plans, the first six procurement \u0010funded UCAVs for the Air Force would be bought in 2006, with eight more to follow in 2007. For the purpose s of this option, CBOassumed that 20 UCAVs would be purchased per year beginning in 2008 and continuing beyond 2013 and that DoD would meet its expressed cost goals for UCAVs. 1 In addition to replacing Air Force F \u001035s with UCAVs, Navy and Marine Corps F \u001035s could also be cut to offset purchases of the Navy's UCAV. CBO has not estimated the savings of such an option because the Navy's unman \u0010 ned aircraft (designated the X \u001047) is not as far along as the X\u001045. It will probably not be procured until the early 2010s or later\u2014and thus falls outside the budgetary win \u0010 dow of this option. The X \u001047 will face the additional challenge of operating from aircraft carriers; the Navy may also expect it to perform patrol missions that could require it to have longer ranges or more loiter time than the Air Force version. UCAVs may have several advantages over manned air \u0010 craft. First, they can perform dangerous missions without risking the lives of their pilots. Second, UCAVs are expected to cost less to acquire and operate than their manned counterparts. The X \u001045 is supposed to cost less than half as much as the Air Force's version of the F \u001035. Its operating costs might represent an even greater per \u0010 centage reduction if the UCAVs are kept in storage when they are not needed, which is the current operational concept. (CBO did not estimate operating savings for this option.) Third, improvements in technology to detect, 1. The Office of the Secretary of Defense seems likely to propose changes in the structure of DoD' s UCAV programs. If, as press reports indicate may happen, DoD combines the UCAV pro \u0010 grams of several of the services into one joint effort (as it did in the restructuring that brought about the F \u001035 program), both production quantities and deve lopment and procurement costs would change, as would the savings and costs of this option.28 BUDGET OPTIONS recognize, and attack targets may have lessened the benefits brought by having a pilot in the cockpit. Indeed, fighter aircraft must fly at such speeds and heights that they depend on the same target information that will be supplied to UCAVs. (However, even the most autono \u0010 mous UCAVs being designed today will not decide whether to bomb targets but will have human operators who make that decision.) Fourth, UCAVs might be able to loiter in the vicinity of a suspected enemy target until more data about the site becomes available, potentially reducing collateral damage. UCAVs may also have some disadvantages. Predators operating in Afghanistan did eliminate some of their targets, according to press reports, but those reports alsosuggest that the unmanned aircraft experienced some failures. Moreover, the success of the more sophisticated UCAV depends on technological advances that are far from certain. One such technology\u2014automatic target recognition\u2014will determine whether the UCAV can find the targets that it is supposed to attack. However, auto \u0010 matic recognition is an objective that has proved elusive. Unmanned aircraft have also experienced more mishaps than expected. If m ore UCAVs had to be bought to offset higher attrition, the savings from this option would be lower. They would also be lower if UCAVs grew signifi \u0010 cantly in cost\u2014which could be a greater concern for UCAVs than for manned attack aircraft since the former may incorporate more unproven technologies.

For exam \u0010 ple, those planes have carried approximately 80 percent of DoD's air cargo during the conflict in Afghanistan. To help remedy a perceived shortfall in airlift capacity, the department recently ordered an extra 60 C \u001017 aircraft beyond the previous goal of 120. Additionally, the Air Force intends to modernize the C \u00105 fleet through the Reliability Enhancement and Re \u0010enginning Program (RERP), a key component of which is the replacement of chronically faulty engines with a commercial variant. According to an Air Force study, the RERP could im \u0010 prove the reliability rate of that fleet by as much as 20 percentage points\u2014in effect, increasing the number of C\u00105s available for missions by up to 20 aircraft. This option would accelerate the replacement of the C \u00105s' engines with new, more reliable ones, helping to increase strategic airlift capacity while providing savings by delay \u0010 ing or reducing purchases of C \u001017s. Depending on how the strategic airlift force was ultimately structured, this option could reduce the need for C \u001017s by 20 to 40 air \u0010 craft, which would translate into sa vings of $6.3 billion in outlays over the next five years. DoD has placed a higher priority on purchasing addi \u0010 tional C\u001017s than on modernizing the C \u00105s. Current plans call for purchasing the additional C \u001017s by 2007, while full \u0010rate modernization of the C \u00105s would not begin until 2009 and then proceed at a rate of 12 aircraft per year through 2016. This option would shift the emphasis to the C \u00105s by speeding up the modernization program, which could be completed in 2012\u2014eight years ahead of the current schedule. Full \u0010scale replacement of the C\u00105s' engines would begin in 2006, at a rate of 24 per year, double the currently planned pace.The savings possible under this option depend on the structure that the strategic airlift force takes over the coming decades. In the near term, modernized C \u00105s and an additional 22 C \u001017s could provide about the same air \u0010 lift capacity as the planned addition of 60 C \u001017s, yielding a savings of 38 C \u001017s. From a longer \u0010term perspective, those C\u00105s plus 39 additional C \u001017s would meet DoD's recently established requirement for the ability to airlift an average of 54.5 million ton \u0010miles of cargo per day and provide a savings of 21 C \u001017s, although the budgetary savings would be smaller than those shown above. Proponents of this option would argue that maintaining a diversified fleet of different types of airlift aircraft is preferable to relying disproportionately on a single type: if one suffers from unforeseen design or maintenance problems, the availability of an alternative ensures that airlift operations can continue. Modernizing the C \u00105s helps maintain that balance with the C \u001017s. Proponents also would argue that the entire airlift fleet would benefit from the C \u00105s' improved reliability because the effects of their breaking down at unexpected points in the airlift cycle could ripple through the airlift system, adversely affecting the general flow of air traffic. Additionally, some analysts predict that the cost of the C \u00105 modernization program will be more than recouped by reduced opera \u0010 tion and support costs. Opponents would argue that an emphasis on moderniz \u0010 ing C\u00105s is a risky proposition, with possibly hidden costs. As of yet, no C \u00105 aircraft have been modified with new engines, so the modernization costs are still uncer \u0010 tain, and the predicted increase in reliability remains un \u0010 proved. Additionally, some opponents would warn that unforeseen structural problems, especially for older A\u0010model aircraft, might render the service life of the C \u00105s too short to be worth the expense of modernization. In30 BUDGET OPTIONS contrast to those risks, opponents would cite the current record of C \u001017s, with their 85 percent mission \u0010capable rate, as proof of their value. Furthermore, opponents would argue, an accelerated program to modernize the C\u00105 s c o u l d b e mo r e c o s t l y t h a n c u r r e n t l y t h o u g h t i f depot facilities needed to be expanded to meet a higher modernization rate. Similarly, that faster pace might re \u0010 quire a greater number of aircraft in depots at any given time, temporarily reducing the number available for air \u0010 lift operations.Finally, critics of this option would argue that the trade \u0010 off between the C \u00105 and C\u001017 aircraft is not simply about cargo capacity. The C \u001017 has capabilities that the C \u00105 lacks. For example, the C \u001017 can land and take off on short, austere runways, and it has defensive countermea \u0010 sures that allow it to operate in hostile situations. How \u0010 ever, supporters of this option would counter, an airlift fleet that includes more than 100 C \u001017s should be suf \u0010 ficient for the relatively unusual occasions when such capabilities are needed.

Those forces have been subject to the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START) since it took effect in December 1994. That treaty limi ts the United States and the countries of the former Soviet Union (Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Uk raine) to 6,000 warheads at the end of a seven\u0010year reduction period that ended in December 2001. The United States' strategic nuclear force currently consists of 1,200 nuclear wa rheads on 500 Minuteman III missiles, 500 warheads on 50 Peacekeeper missiles, 3,200 warheads on C4 and D5 missiles carried on 18 Tri \u0010 dent submarines, and roug hly 1,000 warheads (nuclear bombs and cruise mi ssiles) deployed on nearly 200 stra \u0010 tegic bombers, for a total of 5,900 warheads. At the Moscow Summit on May 24, 2002, Presidents Bush and Putin signed the Treaty Between the United States of America and the Russian Federation on Strategic Offensive Reductions (informally known as the Moscow Treaty). Under that treaty, the United States and Russia would reduce their number of operational strategic nu \u0010 clear warheads to betw een 1,700 and 2,200, about one \u0010 third of the current levels, by 2012. The treaty does not require the actual destruction of a single warhead; nor does it require retirement of delivery platforms\u2014the mis \u0010 siles, submarines, and bombers that carry nuclear war \u0010 heads. Rather, each country may achieve the reductions mandated in the treaty by storing nuclear weapons in a manner that makes them unavailable for immediate op \u0010 erational use. The Moscow Treaty was submitted to the U.S. Senate for ratificati on on June 20, 2002, but the Senate has not acted on it.Before signing the treaty, the Administration had an \u0010 nounced its intent to eventually reduce the number of operational nuclear warheads that the United States maintains to levels essentially identical to those later specified in the Treaty. That intent was announced at the conclusion of the Nuclear Posture Review (NPR) in Janu \u0010 ary 2002. That review conclu ded that strategic forces equipped with between 1,700 and 2,200 operational nuclear warheads would be sufficient to maintain the security of the United States and set an interim goal of reducing the number of op erational warheads to 3,800 by 2007. The Administration's 2003 \u00102007 defense plan submitted in early 2002 partially antic ipated the results of the NPR. That plan would reduce U.S. nuclear forces by retiring all 50 Peacekeeper missiles, converting four of the oldest Trident submarines to a conventional (non \u0010 nuclear) role, and permanently converting all 81 B \u00101 bombers to a conventional role. The nuclear warheads previously carried on those forces would be stored, resulting in a re duction to about 4,800 operational warheads by 2007. This option would lower the United States' operational nuclear arsenal by an other 1,000 warheads by 2007 to fully attain the NPR's interim goal. Also, the option would remove and store a total of 2,600 nuclear warheads by 2012 to achieve the Moscow Treaty's goal of having no more than 2,200 operationa l warheads. If those re \u0010 ductions were achieved without retiring any of the mis \u0010 siles, submarines, and bombers that carry the warheads, no budgetary savings would result. In addition to remov \u0010 ing nuclear warheads from operational use and storing them, this option would re tire 200 Minuteman missiles and two Trident submarines, although those steps would not be required by the treaty.32 BUDGET OPTIONS Compared with the Administration's 2003 \u00102007 plan, this option would save about $100 million in budget authority in 2004, $2.6 billion over the 2004 \u00102008 period, and $5.5 billion th rough 2013. Overall, the 10 \u0010 year savings would come from canceling upgrades to the Minuteman missiles and Trident submarines that would be retired under this opti on (saving $3.2 billion) and from reduced operations costs (saving $2.9 billion). Those savings would be partially offset by the nearly $0.6 billion in costs to retire the delivery platforms and re \u0010 move the warheads. The Congressional Budget Office's (CBO's) estimates do not include any costs to build addi \u0010 tional facilities to store the warheads removed from oper \u0010 ational use because, accordin g to DoD, available storage capacity would be sufficient to accommodate all of those warheads. CBO assumes that, under th is option, 550 nuclear war \u0010 heads would be remo ved by retiring a wing of 150 single \u0010 warhead Minuteman missile s by 2007 and converting 200 Minuteman missiles that currently carry three war \u0010 heads to a single \u0010warhead configuration. The costs to retire the missile s and remove the 550 warheads would total about $250 million over the 2004 \u00102013 period. However, those costs would be more than offset by the $3.1 billion in savings over 10 years \u2014$1 billion from canceling planned upgrades and $2.1 billion from re \u0010 duced operations costs. Also, under this option, about 1,200 nuclear warheads would be removed by retiring two Trident submarines by 2007 and deploying fewer warheads on each of the remaining submarines. CBO estimates that the costs to retire the submarines and remove and store the associated nuclear warheads would total another $250 million over the 2004 \u00102013 period. However, those costs would be more than offset by the $3 billion in savings over 10 years\u2014$2.2 billion from notbuying the missiles ($1.4 billion) and not overhauling the submarines ($0.8 billion); an d $0.8 billion from reduced operations costs. Finally, un der this option, 892 nuclear bombs and cruise missiles carrying nuclear warheads would be removed from service by converting the B \u00102 bombers to a conventional role and deploying fewer cruise missiles on the B \u001052 bombers. CBO estimates that the costs to remove those nuclear weapons would amount to about $50 million through 2013. Proponents of this option might argue that with the reduced threat from a major nuclear power, the United States might now decide that it could safely deploy fewer nuclear warheads on fewer weapon systems. Moreover, despite the reductions in delivery platforms, this option would still retain three types of nuclear systems\u2014the nuclear triad of missiles, submarines, and bombers\u2014and thus provide a margin of security in case an adversary developed a new technology that would render a leg of the triad more vulnerable to attack. In addition, some supporters of this option might argue that current U.S. force requirements are driven by an outdated and unne \u0010 cessarily large target list. Deterrence, they believe, would still be robust with a much smaller arsenal of warheads and fewer delivery platforms. Critics of the option might argue that the Administra \u0010 tion's plans, which to date have involved limited reduc \u0010 tions in the number of nuclear delivery platforms, are a prudent hedge against the emergence of unforeseen threats. Moreover, the submarines that this option would retire could be converted for conventional use. Thus, retiring those submarines might eliminate capabilities to conduct conventional warfare that could prove useful in the future.

Biden Jr. regarding estimated costs and savings from implementing the Moscow Treaty , September 24, 2002CHAPTER TWO FUNCTION 050: NATIONAL DEFENSE 33 050-15\u2014Discretionary Reduce the Trident Submarine Force to 12 and Buy 48 Fewer D5 Missiles Total (Millions of dollars) 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2004-2008 2004-2013 Savings Budget authority 110 170 330 220 200 1,030 2,840Outlays 60 160 270 270 180 940 2,440 Until recently, the Navy depl oyed a fleet of 18 Trident submarines. Eight of those submarines were based in Bangor, Washington, and the other 10 were stationed in Kings Bay, Georgia. All of the submarines at Kings Bay and two of the submarines at Bangor deployed 24 newer, more\u0010capable D5 missiles that, under the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, each carried eight nuclear warheads. The six remaining submarines stationed at Bangor de \u0010 ployed 24 older C4 missiles that carried six nuclear war \u0010 heads apiece. In a ll, about 3,200 warhea ds were deployed on those 18 submarines. The Navy has begun converting four of the Trident sub \u0010 marines that carried C4 missiles to a conventional (non \u0010 nuclear) role. Two of the conversions began in 2003, and the remaining two will star t in 2004. The C4 missiles that will be removed from the submarines will be trans \u0010 ported to a Department of Defense (DoD) facility for disposal. The warheads removed from those missiles will either be reloaded onto the newer D5 missiles or stored at a DoD facility. The Navy's plan to pursue those con \u0010 versions was anno unced in January 2002 after the Nuc \u0010 lear Posture Review (NPR), which concluded that a force of 14 Trident submarines would be sufficient. Under that plan, each of the remaining 14 Trident submarines will be equipped to carry 24 D5 missiles by 2007. According to the Navy, an average of two submarines a year will undergo a major overhaul, during which they will not carry any missiles. The 12 other operationally deployed submarines will carry a to tal of 288 D5 missiles and about 2,300 warheads (about 192 warheads on each submarine). The Administration plans on buying a total of 540 D5 missiles\u2014288 for the Trident submarines, 86 that have already been purchased for flight tests (through 2002), and 166 for future fl ight tests and spares. By the end of2002, the Navy had purchased 396 missiles; it plans to buy the remaining 144 mi ssiles over the 2003 \u00102013 period. In all, the Congressional Budget Office assumes that the 12 operationally deployed submarines would carry 1,152 warheads, or about 96 warheads on each sub \u0010 marine. This option would retire two Trident submarines carry \u0010 ing the older C4 missiles when they would otherwise be upgraded to carry the newe r D5 missiles (one in 2005 and another one the following year). The option would also cancel the planned purchase of 48 D5 missiles because fewer missiles would be needed to support a 12 \u0010 submarine force. To keep a similar number of warheads overall, the smaller Triden t force would carry 111 war \u0010 heads on each submarine in stead of 96. Compared with the Administration's plan, this option would save about $1 billion in budget authority over the 2004 \u00102008 period and $2.8 billion over 10 years. Sp ecifically, by retiring the two submarines early, the Navy would save about $0.6 billion from re duced operations during the 2004 \u00102013 period, net of the costs to retire the submarines. In addi \u0010 tion, retiring the submar ines by 2007 would save $2.2 billion in planned upgrades and purchases over that 10 \u0010 year period. (That figure results because not overhauling the two submarines to accommodate the newer D5 mis \u0010 siles would save about $0.8 bi llion and not buying the D5 missiles that would be deployed on the overhauled submarines would save about $1.4 billion.) Purchasing 48 fewer D5s would have several drawbacks, however. The Navy recently extended the service life of Trident submarines from the original 30 years to 44 years. That extension created a mismatch between the life span of the submarines and the life span of their missiles, so the Administration has begun to extend the service life of D5 missiles. That program involves redesigning the34 BUDGET OPTIONS guidance sets and retrofitting every missile with them, requiring additional flight tests to judge the guidance sets' performance. Those flight tests are scheduled to take place over the 2008 \u00102013 period. If production of D5 missiles had ceased by then (as it would under this op \u0010 tion) and those flight tests ended up requiring more D5s, reopening production lines could be costly. Opponents of this option might also argue that loading more warheads on existing missiles would reduce their range and lessen the flexibility of the force, since missiles with fewer warheads can cover more widely dispersed targets. In addition, cutting the number of operationally deployed submarines from 12 to 10 could increase their vulnerability to attack by Russian antisubmarine forces.Nevertheless, some people would consider the capability retained under this option sufficient to deter nuclear war. Although the missiles' range and the submarines' patrol areas would be smaller, they would still exceed the levels planned during the Cold War\u2014when Russia had more antisubmarine forces and the United States intended to deploy the D5 with eight large warheads (W \u001088s). More \u0010 over, less targeting flexibility might not reduce the force's nuclear deterrent: 1,152 warheads deployed on 288 mis \u0010 siles might not deter an ad versary any more than the 1,110 warheads on 240 missiles ca lled for in th is option. The end of the Cold War and Russia's atrophying nuclear forces may have weakened the rationale for the United States to be able to increase its forces by adding warheads to the D5 missile.

DoD pays for many personnel benefits\u2014for example, commissaries, some medical care, DoD schools, and on\u0010base family housing\u2014from other appropriations. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) pays some additional benefits, such as ones under the Montgomery GI bill and veterans' disability payments. Under this option, the DoD \u0010funded personnel \u0010support costs mentioned above would become part of the military personnel appropriation. Some VA programs might also be funded in the defense budget as well. That realignment of funding would have two related goals: to provide more\u0010accurate information about how much money is being allocated to support military personnel and to give DoD managers a greater incentive to use resources wisely. The amount that this option might save is unknown (so no table is shown). But with the total cost of supporting military personnel at abou t $115 billion per year, the potential savings from better management are substantial. Savings of just 1 percent, for example, would equal about $1 billion annually. The current distribution of personnel costs among differ \u0010 ent appropriations makes it difficult for DoD, the Con \u0010 gress, and taxpayers to track the total level of resources devoted to supporting military personnel. Changes in the level of the appropriation for military personnel can be either offset or enhanced by changes in the resourcesdevoted to health care, housing, or education benefits that are funded from other appropriations. The total picture is rarely, if ever, seen\u2014making it hard to analyze total compensation or to make comparisons with civilian com \u0010 pensation. DoD has some recent experience in consolidating costs into the military personnel appropriation. When DoD adopted accrual funding for the cost of Medicare \u0010eligible retirees' health care in 2003, those funds shifted out of the operation and maintenance accounts and into the military personnel account. This option would expand that concept by incorporating additional personnel sup \u0010 port costs. Advocates of this option would argue that further consoli \u0010 dation would improve the incentives for DoD managers to use military personnel effectively, encouraging them to substitute less costly civilian employees of the depart \u0010 ment, contractors, or labor \u0010saving technology for military personnel where possible. Critics of this option would argue that implementation could be difficult. For example, new financial manage \u0010 ment systems and a new structure for appropriations would be required. Moreover, the responsibilities and the structure of various Congressional subcommittees might need to change. Finally, in order to realize savings, DoD leaders would have to respond to the new incentives by reducing their reliance on military personnel or by in \u0010 creasing efficiency. RELATED CBO PUBLICATION :Accrual Budgeting for Military Retirees' Health Ca re, March 200236 BUDGET OPTIONS 050-17\u2014Discretionary Target Pay to Meet Military Requirements Total (Millions of dollars) 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2004-2008 2004-2013 pay that military members receive includes basic pay, which depends on rank and years of service, as well as bonuses, allowances, and the tax advantage that arises because some allowances are not subject to federal income tax. Basic pay is the most important element of cash pay, averaging 55 percent or more of total cash compensation. The 2001 defense authorizatio n act included provisions to increase basic pay at a greater rate than recent pay growth in the private sector. Those provisions set the annual military pay raise between 2001 and 2006 at 0.5 percentage points above the increase in the employment cost index (ECI) for wages and salaries of private \u0010sector workers. In addition to those general pay increases, the Department of Defense (DoD) requested in the 2002 and 2003 defense authorization acts, and the Congress autho \u0010 rized, changes in the pay table to improve retention of both officers and enlisted personnel in certain pay grades. Those legislative changes have raised the pay for average enlisted personnel by 16 percent between 1999 and 2003, for example, and the pay for senior enlisted personnel by 31 percent (in real terms). Real pay for officers has risen by 13 percent over the same period. Those changes ap \u0010 pear to have improved retention, as all of the military services reported strong overall retention in 2002. In addition to pay raises, another tool that the services have used is selected reenlistment bonuses (SRBs), which are cash incentives that encourage the reenlistment of qualified service members in occupational specialties with high training costs or demonstrated shortfalls in reten \u0010 tion. Eligible personnel generally receive half of their bo \u0010 nus when they reenlist and the remainder in annual pay \u0010 ments over the course of their additional obligation. Each service regularly adjusts its SRBs to address current reten \u0010 tion problems, adding or dropping eligible specialties and raising or lowering bonus levels.Yet shortages remain among specific occupations. On average, between 1999 and 2002, about 30 percent of oc \u0010 cupations for enlisted personnel had shortages, while about 40 percent were overstaffed. To address current oc \u0010 cupational shortages of experienced personnel, this option would substitute reenlistment bonuses for part of the planned future pay raises. It would limit annual pay raises to 2 percent in 2004 thro ugh 2006 and offer SRBs to service members in those occupations where shortages remained. This option would approximately double the services' spending on initial bonus payments over four years, by adding about $108 million in bo nuses annually from 2004 through 2007, and remo ve current restrictions on the maximum bonus amount that an individual can receive. After 2006, pay raises for all personnel would be in step with the employment cost index. Those changes would save $714 million in outlays in 2004 and more than $11 billion between 2004 and 2008. Service mem \u0010 bers receiving the bonuses would have higher overall pay than under the current pl an between 2004 and 2006. But because bonuses do not compound in the same way as general pay raises, they would have lower overall compen \u0010 sation in 2007 and beyond, unless the bonus program was extended. Advocates of this option would argue that increasing selected reenlistment bonuses would be more efficient than increasing pay in general because bonuses allow DoD to target military pay to specific occupational skills where there are shortages. General pay increases would lessen shortages in some occupations but would also worsen surpluses in other occupations. In addition, compared with pay increases, bonuses would be easier to adjust from year to year as recruiting and retention goals changed. Furthermore, bonuses would not incur the heavy cost of \"tag \u0010alongs,\" the elements of compensation, such as retirement benefits, that are ti ed to basic pay. CHAPTER TWO FUNCTION 050: NATIONAL DEFENSE 37 Supporters of this option would also argue that bonuses could be focused on the years of service in which per \u0010 sonnel make career decisions. In addition, they might argue that the current bonus levels are too small to pro \u0010 vide meaningful differences in pay among occupations and that larger differences would be a cost \u0010effective tool for improving military readiness. Some critics of expanding reenlistment bonuses would argue that large pay differences among occupations couldviolate a long \u0010standing principle of military compensa \u0010 tion: that personnel with similar levels of responsibility should receive similar pay. Turning the argument about tag\u0010alongs on its head, critics would also say that increas \u0010 ing bonuses would unfairly deprive service members of the retirement and other benefits that they would receive if that money was part of basic pay throughout their career. RELATED OPTION : 050\u00102038 BUDGET OPTIONS 050-18\u2014Discretionary Reduce Military Personnel in Overseas Headquarters Positions Total (Millions of dollars) 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2004-2008 2004-2013 Savings Budget authority 115 237 371 114 236 371 383 396 3,705 The last fundamental reorganization of military head \u0010 quarters occurred under the Goldwater \u0010Nichols Act of 1986. That law gave the un ified theater commands\u2014 such as the European and Pacific Commands\u2014the lead role in planning operations and executing policy and had them report directly to the President. When a crisis devel \u0010 ops requiring additional military forces and support, a unified commander calls on the four military services to provide that support. The services' role is to recruit, train, equip, and support unified commanders' forces, while unified commanders exercise geographic command and control. In practice, however, unified commanders are another management layer over existing overseas service \"com \u0010 ponent\" commands such as U.S. Army Europe and the Pacific Fleet. The unified commanders' requests for forces and support are relayed through those component com \u0010 mands to the services' U.S. headquarters. With each service maintaining a separate headquarters component in a region, redundancies exist in many management functions. And in some regions, the only personnel in a particular service branch are those at the component command headquarters. The overseas component com \u0010 mand headquarters current ly comprise some 6,000 per \u0010 sonnel, or 10 percent of all headquarters staff. This option would reorganize the military's command structure by eliminating the overseas component head \u0010 quarters. Savings could then come from reducing the number of management personnel by 4,000, which would save $1.5 billion over fi ve years if the personnel reductions produced cuts in end strength. Alternatively, the reorganization migh t allow for 4,000 additional troops for more critical missions. However, no savings would result from that approach.According to proponents of this option, eliminating over \u0010 seas component commands would improve command and control as well as provide personnel savings. It would streamline command, control, and communications by eliminating an entire layer of headquarters between the services and the unified commanders. Yet, assuming that some of the overseas component commands' responsibili \u0010 ties could not be eliminated, it would retain some of those personnel. The services assert that continued commitments overseas, combined with new requirements at home, have stretched the active \u0010duty military to its limits. Also, the newly created Northern Command and the Department of Defense's emphasis on creating standing joint forces\u2014 multiservice units that can deploy anywhere with little notice\u2014may require additional personnel. Instead of simply eliminating the positions for budgetary savings, this option could provide the Secretary of Defense with available personnel without increasing personnel costs. Some military analysts, howe ver, argue that the overseas component commands provide essential support to the unified commanders: dedicated and responsive support for staging operations and integrating personnel and equipment deployed to a region, freeing the unified com \u0010 manders to concentrate on the responsibilities of war \u0010 fighting. Additionally, overseas component commands bolster theater \"enablers\" such as medical support, engi \u0010 neering, intelligence, fuel handling, and the movement of supplies. Other responsibilities include managing the planning and execution of joint and coalition military exercises and treaty obligations as directed by NATO (the North Atlantic Treaty Orga nization) and by bilateral agreements, for example. Finally, those commands sup \u0010 port legal responsibilities such as contracting, logistics support, and facilities management.CHAPTER TWO FUNCTION 050: NATIONAL DEFENSE 39 Opponents of restructuring also argue that it is politically and practically too difficult, considering the uncertainties in the world. The reorganization envisioned in this op \u0010 tion would be the single largest restructuring since the 1986 Goldwater \u0010Nichols Act, and it could eliminate up to 45 general officer positions overseas. However, others,including senior staff members of the Office of the Secre \u0010 tary of Defense, argue that despite the difficulty, the new threat environment and the need for additional combat troops demand consideration of just such a widespread reorganization. 40 BUDGET OPTIONS 050-19\u2014Discretionary Replace Military Personnel in Some Support Positions with Civilian Employees of the Department of Defense Total (Millions of dollars) 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2004-2008 2004-2013 Savings Budget authority 201 417 649 191 8,140 This option would replac e 20,000 of the 1.4 million uni \u0010 formed military personnel in certain support jobs with civilian employees of the Department of Defense (DoD). An examination of job functions reveals some jobs that one service considers \"military essential\" but the others do not and some functions that clearly could be open to civilians. Some analysts put the number of military positions that could be converted to civilian jobs as high as 90,000. Successfully converting 20,000 positions\u2014and reducing military end stre ngth by that amount\u2014could save $191 million in outlay s in 2004 and $3 billion over five years. Greater savings could be possible if some of those positions were deemed eligible for competition with contract personnel. Some of the savings from this option would occur because civilians, unencumbered by mili \u0010 tary\u0010specific responsibilities, have more time available to perform their jobs, so fewer co uld be substituted for mili \u0010 tary personnel. Under this option , the replacement of the 20,000 mili \u0010 tary positions with civilian employees of DoD would be phased in over four years. Also, the savings estimated for this option assume that future military and civilian pay raises are in accordance with statutory provisions. Although in recent years, many analysts have called on DoD to reduce costs by transferring military positions to civilian ones, only a small percentage of the depart \u0010 ment's total personnel have been subject to review. In 2002, DoD undertook an inventory of all positions (civilian and military), categorizing them by function and determining whether they were inherently governmental and, if so, whether they had to be filled by military per \u0010 sonnel. That inventory could be used to identify many support positions that, although currently occupied bymilitary personnel, could be performed by civilian em \u0010 ployees of DoD at lower cost. For positions in the functional category of Morale, Wel \u0010 fare, and Recreation Services, for example, the Army fills 2 percent of those jobs with military personnel, whereas the Navy fills 13 percent, and the Air Force categorizes 32 percent as military. Removing the military designation on the Air Force position s could open up 1,000 jobs to civilians. In another example, the Army fills 35 percent of the positions in the functional category of Legal Ser \u0010 vices and Support with military personnel, and the Navy fills 53 percent. However, the Air Force requires 70 per \u0010 cent of those positions to be military personnel. Remov \u0010 ing the military designation on some Air Force and Navy positions could open anot her 500 jobs to civilians. Opponents of this option would argue that the process of defining, evaluating, and then redesignating personnel positions would be lengthy and cumbersome, with hard \u0010 to\u0010define savings. Furthermore, they would point out, comparisons among services can be misleading to some extent, because certain func tional areas have service \u0010 specific aspects. For example, the Navy claims that it must rely on military personnel on board ships to serve in support positions. Finally, if civilian employees of DoD were substituted for military personnel without reducing end strength, DoD's total costs would increase, not decrease. However, propo \u0010 nents of transferring military personnel out of nonmili \u0010 tary tasks argue that even if military end strength was not reduced, \"warfighters\" would still be freed up to fulfill their primary purpose.CHAPTER TWO FUNCTION 050: NATIONAL DEFENSE 41 050-20\u2014Discretionary Increase the Use of Warrant Office rs to Attract and Retain Personnel Total (Millions of dollars) 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2004-2008 2004-2013 Savings Budget authority 214 189 159 124 81 767 1,318Outlays 203 190 161 125 83 763 1,312 Warrant officers, who account for only about 1 percent of active\u0010duty military personnel, currently serve as senior techni \u0010 cal experts and managers in a wide variety of occupations and, in the Army, as pilots of helicopters and fixed \u0010wing aircraft. In rank, they fall between enlisted personnel and other commis \u0010 sioned officers. Warrant officers\u2014and the closely related limited duty officers in the Navy\u2014tend to have long careers in which they gain considerable expertise. This option would slowly expand the use of warrant officers as a means of attracting and retaining high \u0010quality, skilled personnel, particularly in occupations with attractive civilian alternatives. To achieve savings, it would offer smaller pay raises to senior enlisted personnel. Programs designed to help the military meet its personnel needs tend to be more cost \u0010effective the more narrowly focused they are on the people and the decisions that they are intended to affect. Some analysts have pointed out that growing numbers of midcareer and senior enlisted personnel have substantial col \u0010 lege training, which current military pay scales may not ade \u0010 quately recognize. The Department of Defense (DoD), in part to address that trend, has increased pay for senior enlisted per \u0010 sonnel more rapidly than for other military personnel. For ex \u0010 ample, between 1999 and 2003, real pay for senior enlisted per \u0010 sonnel rose by about 31 percent while real pay for enlisted personnel generally increased by about 16 percent. Instead of raising the pay of a ll midcareer and senior enlisted personnel, however, DoD could offer warrant officer positions (with their higher pay) to those people it most wanted to retain or to those who were serving in military occupations with the best\u0010paying civilian alternatives. Under this option, pay raises for senior enlisted personnel from 2004 through 2006 wouldbe 1.25 percentage points below those currently planned by DoD. In 2007 and 2008, pay raises for those senior personnel would be 1.25 percentage points below the increase in the employment cost index. This option would also convert 10,000 positions for enlisted personnel in the top four grades to warrant officer positions. Net savings from those changes would total $763 million from 2004 through 2008. A program that expanded opportunities for warr ant officers could be focused on specific occupational areas, such as information technology, where a robust civilian sector can make military compensation noncompetitive. Traditionally, DoD has used enlistment and reenlistment bonuses to fill such positions, although some people might argue that current bonus levels are too small to provide meaningful differences in pay among occupations. Advocates of this proposal might also point to other advantages. Expanded opportunities for warrant officers might be more attractive to graduates of two \u0010year colleges, who could come in as professionals instead of having to serve a long apprenticeship in the enlisted ranks. Serving as a warrant officer rather than as an enlistee might also appeal to people who would rather re \u0010 main technical specialists than assume leadership respon \u0010 sibilities. It is possible that the resulting more \u0010experienced workforce could reduce the size of the force that DoD needs. Critics of this proposal would argue that converting senior enlisted positions to warrant officer positions would create a new set of problems. Currently, there are relatively few warrant officers\u2014only about 15,400 were serving on active duty at the end of 2002. Adding another 10,000 officers to that pool could make the force more top \u0010heavy without a commensurate in \u0010 crease in leadership skills. Some people within the military might object to having a larger group of senior technicians who did not have leadership responsibilities.

After several years of difficulty in reaching recruiting goals, the military services all managed to meet or exceed their targets in 2002. For 2003, the recruiting environment appears to remain favorable. For example, as of November 30, 2002, the Army had about 35,000 recruits in its Delayed Entry Program (DEP) waiting to report for training, as compared with about 19,000 at the same time last year and on ly 17,000 the year before. The quality of recruits is also high for all of the services, with more than 90 percent of those in the DEP classified as high quality. Over the long term, prospects for recruiting also appear favorable, as the unusual combination of demographic and economic factors that made recruiting so difficult in the past seems unlikely to reappear. In the latter half of the 1990s , the military services ex \u0010 perienced considerable difficu lty\u2014and occasionally failed to meet\u2014their recruiting targets. Much of that difficulty, however, can be attributed to the unusually low unem \u0010 ployment rates among teenagers during those years. The unemployment rate for people ages 16 to 19\u2014which had hovered near 20 pe rcent in the early 1990s\u2014fell, and in 1999 dropped below 14 percent for the first time in the history of the All \u0010Volunteer Force. Low unemploymentrates translate into better civilian opportunities for the young adults that the military tries to attract, making the recruiting mission more difficult and costly. The Department of Defense's spending on recruiting and related activities (measured in constant dollars) increased by more than 30 percen t between 1980 and 2002; be \u0010 cause of the decreasing size of the military, the increase in spending per recruit wa s far greater. In 2002, the cost per active\u0010duty enlisted recruit was two and a half times what it had been in 1980. The factors that required those increases have, however, abated. The unemployment rate among teenagers is back to about 17 percent, and the size of the young \u0010adult population, which has already in \u0010 creased by 15 percent from its post \u0010baby\u0010boom low in 1994, is projected to grow steadily through 2011. In addition, the military services have recently begun sig \u0010 nificant recruiting efforts among college students and students who have had some college coursework, which should further increase the pool of high \u0010quality candidates. The savings from this option would, however, make the recruiting mission more challenging. If the recruiting environment worsened significantly, this option could result either in a need for additional resources for recruit \u0010 ing or in another failure to meet recruiting goals.CHAPTER TWO FUNCTION 050: NATIONAL DEFENSE 43 050-22\u2014Discretionary Have the Departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs Purchase Drugs Jointly Total (Millions of dollars) 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2004-2008 2004-2013 Savings Budget authority 44 114 144 157 173 632 1,773Outlays 38 104 138 154 170 604 1,723 In 2002, the Departments of Defense (DoD) and Vet \u0010 erans Affairs (VA) together spent about $4.7 billion on pharmaceuticals. Nationwide, spending on prescription drugs has grown roughly twice as fast in recent years as total national spending on health care. Constraining such cost growth is an important goal for DoD and VA. This option would consolidate DoD's and VA's pur \u0010 chases of pharmaceutical pr oducts, as the Congressional Commission on Servicemembers and Veterans Transition Assistance re commended in 1999. Specifically, it would require the two agencies to organize a joint procurement office and develop a common clinically based formulary, or a list of prescription drug s that both agencies' health plans would agree to provide. Formularies can save money by encouraging providers to substitute generic versions for brand \u0010name drugs or by including only speci \u0010 fic preferred brand \u0010name drugs within a therapeutic class. The joint formulary would apply throughout the VA health system, to mail \u0010order pharmacy services, and at military hospitals and clinics. Once in place, it would allow the agencies to enter into more \"committed vol \u0010 ume\" contracts with pharmaceutical manufacturers, which generally lead to lower drug prices. In addition, this option would merge the two agencies' mail \u0010order pharmacy services. Those changes would save DoD and VA a total of $38 million in outlays in 2004 and $604 million through 2008. In recent years, DoD and VA have attempted to combine some purchases, but that collaboration has been limited, and they continue to maintain separate formularies and procurement offices. VA's National Acquisition Center is responsible for purchasing prescription drugs for most federal agencies except DoD, and it negotiates and maintains the federal supply schedules of prices for those items. The Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP),an office of the Defense Logistics Agency, negotiates prices for pharmaceutical products and draws up contracts with vendors to buy and deliver those products to military treatment facilities. DSCP also makes plans to deliver those items overseas quickly in the event of a conflict. Proponents of joint purchasing would argue that DoD and VA need to rein in the rapid growth of prescription drug costs. In addition, those proponents would say, the need for separate procurement offices is not apparent. According to a 1998 report by DoD's Inspector General, only a tiny fraction of the items that the DSCP procures on behalf of military facilities are \"militarily unique\"; most are common items. VA officials maintain that the National Acquisition Center has already achieved signi \u0010 ficant savings on many of its pharmaceutical purchases through committed \u0010volume contracts. A recent study by the Institute of Medicine seems to confirm that point: it estimated that VA saved about 15 percent on drug pur \u0010 chases in six therapeutic classes by selecting a preferred drug in each class. In developing a common formulary, the two agencies would need to adopt procedures by which physicians could prescribe nonformulary drugs to patients who needed them (for example, because they were allergic to the formulary drugs). The design and execution of such an exception process would affect the savings from this option. The stricter the process, the higher would be the cost of documenting and judging a patient's need for a nonformulary drug. A less restrictive process, however, would reduce the government's bargaining power and could reduce the savings from this option. Critics of consolidation argue that such savings are un \u0010 achievable. The veterans who obtain health care from VA44 BUDGET OPTIONS make up a very different mix of medical cases than mili \u0010 tary beneficiaries do\u2014for example, more of them suffer from mental illness, substance abuse, or severe disabilities (such as spinal cord injuries). Therefore, the degree of overlap in prescription drugs dispensed by the two agencies may be limited. Some observers argue that DoD and VA have already taken important steps to expand their joint procurement. The General Accounting Office estimates that the depart \u0010 ments currently save about $170 million per year through joint purchasing contracts. From October 1998 to April 2002, DoD and VA awarded jo int contracts for 18 prod \u0010 ucts. Nevertheless, DoD officials contend that they must maintain their own procurement office to ensure that drug supplies will be available quickly in the event of war. Some officials believe that the agencies will achieve the bulk of any possible savings simply by sharing price datawith each other so they can negotiate the lowest prices with pharmaceutical manufacturers and suppliers. Finally, some analysts might argue that this option would not go far enough. Savings could be even larger if DoD implemented a uniform formulary for all three types of pharmacies that its beneficiaries use: pharmacies at mili \u0010 tary hospitals and clinics, the mail \u0010order service, and re \u0010 tail pharmacies (where beneficiaries receive partial reim \u0010 bursement through insurance). DoD officials say that as they have tightened the form ularies of drugs available at military facilities, beneficiaries have increasingly turned to retail outlets\u2014which often costs DoD more than if the department had purchased the drugs at federal prices and dispensed them itself. (Consequently, the estimate for this option assumes that DoD's insurance claims for phar \u0010 macy services would increase.) If DoD could enforce a single formulary at all pharmacy outlets, it would achieve greater savings.CHAPTER TWO FUNCTION 050: NATIONAL DEFENSE 45 050-23\u2014Discretionary Introduce a \"Cafeteria Plan\" for the Health Benefits of Family Members of Active-Duty Military Personnel Total (Millions of dollars) 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2004-2008 2004-2013 Savings Budget authority 18 76 188 207 216 705 1,931Outlays 14 64 164 199 212 653 1,861 Under the Department of Defense's (DoD's) current health care system, many families may be overinsured. That is, given a choice, many would prefer a somewhat less generous health care pl an and greater cash compensa \u0010 tion. This option would give families that choice by having DoD provide the family members of active \u0010duty personnel with a special cash allowance for their health coverage. The allowance, which would be nontaxable (like the current housing allowance), could be used in one of three ways. First, family members could purchase TRI \u0010 CARE coverage, which would include any of the current options (TRICARE Standard, TRICARE Extra, and TRICARE Prime). Second, they could use some of the money to purchase a new \"low option\" TRICARE plan and keep the remaining funds. That version of TRICARE would be similar to TRICARE Prime in that it would have m any m anaged care features. However, it would also incorporate a substantial deductible as well as copayments for health care services obtained at either military treat \u0010 ment facilities or from civilian providers. Third, military family members could show proof of employer \u0010provided insurance and apply the allowance toward their share of the premiums, copayments, and deductibles. This option would save $653 mi llion in outlays over the next five years. That estimate incorporates the cost of the cash allowances. It also accounts for the decrease in de \u0010 mand for health care by people choosing the new low \u0010 option plan, because copayments and deductibles would improve the efficiency of health care utilization. The esti \u0010 mate also takes into consideration the fact that there are a few eligible family members of active \u0010duty personnel who are not currently using TRICARE and who thus cost the system nothing but who would be likely to apply for the cash allowance. Supporters of this option argue that it would offer several advantages. First, families of active \u0010duty personnel would have greater choice about the mix of benefits and cash that they received. Second, those who chose the low \u0010 option plan would be more likely to make cost \u0010effective use of medical services because they would face a share of the costs of those services. Third, some health coverage costs would be shifted from DoD to spouses' civilian employers, reducing the department's spending. Finally, because family members would have to commit to an arrangement for their health insurance annually, total utilization would be easier to predict than it is under the current system, which users may join or leave at any time. Consequently, this option would improve resource plan \u0010 ning within the military health system and allow DoD to negotiate firmer contracts for pharmaceuticals and civilian medical services. That advantage would exist even if most beneficiaries chose to remain in one of the three traditional TRICARE plans. Opponents of this option note that people who selected the low\u0010option TRICARE coverage would be taking on additional risks and might face financial difficulties if someone in their family fell seriously ill. However, that level of coverage would be designed to include a reason \u0010 able \"stop \u0010loss\" limit to control the financial conse \u0010 quences of catastrophic illness. Opponents also point out that families who chose an employer\u0010provided plan might face the complication of having their coverage disrupted if the active \u0010duty spouse experienced a permanent change of station in the middle of the year. DoD would have to develop methods to pro \u0010 rate cash allowances and dedu ctibles for people forced to change their health care plans midyear.46 BUDGET OPTIONS 050-24\u2014Discretionary Create Incentives for Military Families to Save Energy Total (Millions of dollars) 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2004-2008 2004-2013 Savings Budget authority 4 21 42 52 53 173 460O u t l a y s 31 63 5 4 85 2 1 5 4 4 3 7 The Department of Defense (DoD) spent about $360 million last year on gas, electricity, and water for the approximately 200,000 family housing units in the United States that it owns. Many of those units are slated for privatization by 2006, bu t DoD expects to retain about 121,000 units for the fore seeable future. To date, the department's efforts to reduce energy costs in family housing units by promoting conservation have met with limited success. One reason is that service members living in DoD\u0010owned housing do not pay for their utilities and may not even know how much gas, electricity, and water they use. Landlords in the private sector have found that utility use typically declines by about 20 percent when tenants are responsible for their own utility bills. This option would install utility meters in DoD's housing units, provide cash allowances for utility bills to the fami \u0010 lies living there, and then charge them for utilities on the basis of actual use. Residents who spent less than their allowance could keep the savings; those who spent more would pay the extra cost out of pocket. The budget for allowances would be set equal to the expected cost of utilities under the new system, or about 80 percent of what DoD now spends. The department would allocate that amount among the different housing units on the basis of their size, energy efficiency, and location. Although DoD would incur the up \u0010front costs of deter \u0010 mining allowance amounts, setting up a billing system, and installing meters, this option could save $3 million in outlays in 2004 and a to tal of $154 million from 2004 through 2008. Once the program was established, the allowance budget for each year could be set equal to the previous year'sactual utility charges plus an adjustment for inflation. If service members were able to cut their utility usage by more than 20 percent, allowances would fall and the savings from this option would increase. If, however, 20 percent overestimates service members' ability to reduce their usage, allowances would be higher and the savings would be less. The proposed system would operate very similarly to one being implemented by DoD in most privatized units. Energy costs are borne explicitly by the families occupy \u0010 ing the units. Extending that system to units owned and operated by DoD should be straightforward. Many of the department's housing units already have a connection where a meter could be installed. The principal advantage of this option is that it would reduce DoD's costs by giving military families who live on\u0010base the same incentives for conservation that most homeowners and renters have\u2014including military fami \u0010 lies who live off \u0010base. Because families who conserved ag \u0010 gressively would receive more in allowances than they would be charged for utilities, they would be rewarded. Families who did not economize would face utility bills in excess of their allowances. Critics of this option might argue that, in the case of some housing units, the allowances did not account for physical characteristics that made energy conservation difficult. People living in such units might find that the allowances did not cover all of their utility costs even after they had made reasonable conservation efforts. To ad \u0010 dress those concerns, DoD could grant exemptions from the metering requirement, utility allowances, and charges.

Those chains, which provide a wide array of retail goods and consumer services at military bases, have combined annual sales of about $10 billion. This option would consolidate the three systems into a single organization. In addition, it would introduce incentives for more\u0010efficient operations by requiring the combined system to pay all of its operating costs out of its own sales revenue, rather than relying on DoD to provide some services free of charge. Those changes would save about $200 million annually after a three\u0010year phase \u0010in period. (The next option, 050 \u001026, would go one step farther and consolidate the exchanges with DoD's separate network of commissaries.) Numerous studies sponsored by the Office of the Secretary of Defense have shown that consolidating the exchange systems could lead to significant effici encies. It would eliminate the costs of duplicative purchasing and personnel departments, warehouse and distribution systems, and management head \u0010 quarters. Although consolidation would entail some one \u0010time costs, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that those costs would be more than offset by one \u0010time savings from the reduction in inventories that consolidation would permit. DoD provides the exchanges with about $400 million in free services each year, CBO estimates. Those services include main \u0010 taining some parts of buildings (such as roofs, windows, and heating and cooling systems), transporting goods overseas, and providing utilities at overseas stores. Under this option, the combined system would reimburse DoD for the cost of such services and would thus have an incentive to economize on their use. Furthermore, the requirement for the system to pay all ofits own operating costs would improve the exchanges' visibility in the defense budget. Today, earnings from the exchanges are used to support the military's morale, welfare, and recreation programs, which con \u0010 tribute to service members' quality of life. If the combined ex \u0010 change system continued to provide earnings to support those programs, it would do so from earnings that represented re \u0010 ceipts in excess of the full cost of operations. To compensate the morale, welfare, and recreation programs for the lower level of support that could result from lower earnings by the system of exchanges, this option assumes that the Congress would ap \u0010 propriate about $50 million annually in additional funds for those programs. That direct fu nding would increase the Con \u0010 gress's control over spending on morale, welfare, and recreation activities. One obstacle to implementing this option would be the need to find an acceptable formula for allocating among the individ \u0010 ual services the funds for morale , welfare, and recreation activi \u0010 ties. The services might be concerned that they would not re \u0010 ceive a fair share of the earnings from a combined exchange system or of the additional appropriations for those activities. In addition, they might fear that over a period of years, the Congress would reduce the amount of additional funding ap \u0010 propriated for those activities. Some critics of consolidation argue that the Navy Exchange Command and the Marine Corps system, with their unique service identities, are better able to meet the needs of their pa \u0010 trons than a larger, DoD \u0010wide system would be. But propo \u0010 nents of consolidation point to the Army and Air Force Ex \u0010 change Service, which has successfully served two distinct services for many years. People who shop in exchanges say their main concern is the ability of exchanges to offer low prices and a wide selection of goods\u2014a concern that a consolidated system might be able to satisfy more effectively.

This option would consolidate those systems into a single retail chain that would operate more efficiently, without any appropriated subsidy. The consolidated system, like the current separate systems, would be responsible for giving military personnel access to low \u0010cost groceries and other retail goods at all DoD installations, including those in isolated or overseas locations. The current commissary and exchange systems operate under very different funding mechanisms. The commis \u0010 sary system, which is run by the Defense Commissary Agency (DeCA), has annual sales of about $5 billion, but it also receives an appropriation of about $1 billion a year. The three exchange systems (the Army and Air Force Exchange Service, the Navy Exchange Command, and the Marine Corp exchange system) have annual sales totaling about $10 billion. They do not receive direct ap \u0010 propriations; instead, they rely on sales revenue to cover their costs. One reason that exchanges can operate without an appro \u0010 priated subsidy is that they charge their customers a higher markup over wholesale prices than commissaries do. Another reason is that the exchange systems are non \u0010 appropriated \u0010fund (NAF) entities rather than federal agencies, which enables them to use more flexible and businesslike practices concerning personnel and procure \u0010 ment. DeCA, by contrast, is a federal agency, so its em \u0010 ployees are civil service personnel, and it follows standard federal procurement practices. This option assumes thatconsolidation would eliminate duplicative overhead head \u0010 quarters functions and that DeCA's civil service employ \u0010 ees would be converted to a NAF workforce. Under this option, the commissary and exchange systems would be consolidated over a five \u0010year period. When that process was comple te, DoD's costs would be about $1.1 billion a year lower (i n 2004 dollars)\u2014about $900 mil \u0010 lion from eliminating the subsidy for commissaries and $200 million from eliminat ing duplicate functions among the exchange systems. This option would return half of that $1.1 billion to active \u0010duty service members through a tax \u0010free grocery allowanc e of about $500 per year payable to personnel eligible to receive the current cash allowances to cover food costs. The grocery allow \u0010 ance would be phased in to coincide with the consolida \u0010 tion of commissary and exchange stores at each base. The remaining $550 million a year would represent savings for DoD. Low\u0010cost shopping on bases has long been a benefit of military service. But recent increases in security on bases and changes in the civilian retail industry have made it more difficult and costly for DoD's fragmented retail systems to provide that benefit. Both commissaries and exchanges must now compete with large discount chains that offer low \u0010cost, one\u0010stop shopping for groceries and general merchandise just outside the gates of many mili \u0010 tary installations. To break even without appropriated funds, the consoli \u0010 dated system would have to charge about 10 percent more for groceries than commissaries do now. (That esti \u0010 mate is based on the difference between the 20 percent markup that exchanges charge and the 5 percent markupCHAPTER TWO FUNCTION 050: NATIONAL DEFENSE 49 that commissaries charge and evidence that exchanges pay lower wholesale prices than commissaries do for the same goods.) At the current level of commissary sales, a 10 percent price increase would cost customers an extra $500 million annually. About $300 million of that price increase would be borne by the military retirees who now shop in commissaries. As a result, this option could face strong opposition from associations of retirees. The average family of a retired service member would pay an additional $150 per year for groceries. Active\u0010duty members and their families would benefit from consolidation. The average such family would pay about $240 more per year for groceries\u2014but that figure would be more than offset by the grocery allowance that the family would receive under this option. (A military family would have to spend about $5,000 per year on groceries in commissaries before a 10 percent price in \u0010 crease outweighed the benefits of a $500 allowance.) Cashallowances would be particularly attractive to personnel who lived off \u0010base and could shop near their home more conveniently than on \u0010base. Moreover, all military families \u2014active\u0010duty, reserve, and retired\u2014would gain from longer store hours, more convenient one \u0010stop shopping, access to private \u0010label groceries (not currently available in commissaries), and the security of a military shopping benefit that did not depend on the annual appropriation process. Some people might nonetheless oppose the change, as it would disrupt familiar modes of shopping. DoD could target the $500 in cash payments to service members in a variety of ways. An allowance based solely on pay grade might be the most effective in enhancing retention and rewarding service members for their work. However, some people might argue that an allowance tied to pay grade and family size would be more equitable. If desired, supplemental payments could be made to junior enlisted personnel with large families who might other \u0010 wise be eligible for Food Stamps.

The Department of Defense (DoD) also operates a separate school system for military dependents living overseas. This option would phase out most of the schools that the DDESS system runs in favor of increased use of local public schools and would consolidate management of any remaining schools into the much larger overseas school system. Those changes would save DoD a total of $300 million in outlays between 2004 and 2008. Savings for the federal government as a whole would be less\u2014about $103 million through 2008\u2014 because the Department of Education would have to spend more on Impact Aid, which it provides to local school districts that enroll dependents of federal employees. (These cost esti \u0010 mates assume that funding for Impact Aid would immediately increase so that the average amount paid per student living on federal land would remain at its current level.) Proponents of this option would argue that the DDESS system takes an uneven and largely arbitrary approach to educating the dependents of active \u0010duty service members. The distribution of its schools is mainly a historical accident, dating to the time when segregated public schools in the South did not adequately serve an integrated military. The great majority of military bases in the United States have no DDESS school. And where such schools do exist, they generally enroll only dependents of active \u0010 duty members who live on \u0010base; those living off \u0010base, and dependents of civilian employees, are the responsibility of local school districts. In addition, most bases with DESS facilities offer only elementary and middle schools; high school students living on\u0010base use the public schools. In most of the places where the DDESS system operates schools, accredited publicschools are readily available\u2014with the possible exceptions of Guam, Puerto Rico, and West Point, where DoD would con \u0010 tinue to run domestic schools under this option. Closing these schools need not create major disruptions. The roughly 25,000 students who might be affected already change schools frequently, in large part because they move often as their military parent is reassigned. In many locations, the public school district could continue to use DoD's facilities. (DoD already offers support to some local districts by allowing public schools to operate on \u0010base or providing additional limited funding on a per \u0010 student basis.) Finally, to ease the transition, DoD's schools would be phased out at a rate of one per district per year rather than all at once. And the local school districts would receive additional one \u0010time funding and would have facilities and equipment transferred to help them absorb their new teaching load. This option might have several disadvantages, however. First, many parents of DDESS students might be reluctant to see the schools phased out because they believe DoD schools offer higher\u0010quality education than local public schools do. Second, if local school districts did not retain the on \u0010base schools, former DDESS students might face longer commutes. Third, some of the savings to the federal government from this option would be offset by increased costs to local school districts. In the past, those districts have effe ctively been subsidized by not having to pay any of the costs of educating DDESS students while receiving at least some direct and indirect tax revenues from their parents. This option would eliminate that subsidy. DoD has undertaken a study of this issue and is due to issue a report next year.

Rents for on\u0010base housing would be set at market \u0010clearing levels (levels at which there would be neither excess vacancies nor waiting lists) and would be based on the size and quality of the units. This option would therefore equalize the value of the housing benefits that the Department of Defense (DoD) provides to families living on \u0010 and off\u0010 base and to families of different sizes. About two \u0010thirds of military families receive cash allow \u0010 ances for housing and buy or rent dwellings in the local community. About one \u0010third of military families give up their housing allowance to live in government \u0010owned and \u0010operated housing or to live in privatized housing spon \u0010 sored by DoD. For those families, the forgone housing allowance can be viewed as the \"rent\" paid to live in on \u0010 base housing. Under the current system, housing allow \u0010 ances provided to military families are based on the costs of rental housing typically occupied by civilians with comparable income, regardless of family size\u2014although in making housing assignments, DoD often provides larger units to larger families. Moreover, the quality of on\u0010base housing has no bearing on the \"rent\" paid\u2014that is, the forgone allowance. The current system creates an incentive for military ser \u0010 vice members (particularly those with large families) to prefer on\u0010base housing or privatized housing over living in the community. For example, a married junior enlisted member with three dependents might be assigned to a three\u0010bedroom townhouse on \u0010base, but the member's forgone housing allowance might equal the cost of a two \u0010 bedroom apartment in the community. That incentive inflates the demand for government \u0010owned and priva \u0010tized housing. In response to that higher demand, DoD is increasing the number of larger units. In addition, the growing number of large military families will boost the demand for ancillary family support services on \u0010base. Convenient access to subsidized on \u0010base services, such as child care and commissaries, also creates a financial in \u0010 centive to live on \u0010base rather than in the community. Charging market \u0010based rates fo r both DoD \u0010owned and privatized units would equalize the value of the housing benefit for all personnel regardless of whether they live on\u0010 or off\u0010base. Under this option, for example, that junior enlisted member would either live in a two \u0010 bedroom unit (either on \u0010base or off\u0010base) with no out \u0010of\u0010 pocket costs or pay to obtain a three \u0010bedroom unit (either on\u0010base or off \u0010base). Because the financial incentive to prefer on\u0010base housing would be removed and the de \u0010 mand for those units would fall, proponents of this ap \u0010 proach would argue that fewer aging units would need to be renovated or replaced. On \u0010base (or privatized) hous \u0010 ing units would be replaced or renovated if they met one of two criteria: their value to service members (the market\u0010clearing rents they could command) was suffi \u0010 cient to cover both operating costs and amortized capital costs, or their historical nature or importance for military readiness made the units indispensable. Those criteria would limit DoD to renovating or replacing about 25 percent of its existing housing stock, the Congressional Budget Office estimates. Savings from this option could total more than $2 billion in outlays and more than $5 billion in budg et authority from 2004 through 2008. On average, the market rent would tend to equal the housing allowance, so military personnel would not incur net costs. Savings could be less if future decisions about realigning or closing bases re \u0010 quired substantial new construction of family housing52 BUDGET OPTIONS units. Savings could be greater if the reduced demand for on\u0010base housing also lessened the demand for ancillary services, such as child care centers or commissaries. Opponents of this approach argue that it ignores the important nonmonetary aspects of living on \u0010base (foster \u0010ing unit cohesion, for example). In addition, large fami \u0010 lies currently living on \u0010base would be worse off than they are now because they would lose subsidized access to larger dwellings. This option also would represent a significant break with military tradition and therefore could have a negative impact on morale.

Under cur \u0010 rent policies, however, the prices that the depots charge units for repairing such components (known as depot \u0010 level reparables, or DLRs) exceed the actual cost of mak \u0010 ing the repairs. Those pricing policies raise total costs to the Department of Defense (DoD) because they dis \u0010 courage commanders from relying on the depots even when doing so would be less costly for DoD as a whole. For example, one avionics sensor used by the Army costs $16,000 to repair at a local facility and $12,000 to repair at a depot. Nevertheless, under the current pricing struc \u0010 ture, the depot charges $71,000 to repair the sensor\u2014 creating an incentive for unit commanders to use their local facilities even though the actual cost of the repair is less at the depot. This option would change depots' pricing policies so that depots would charge only the actual cost of repairs. By encouraging unit commanders to choose the most cost \u0010 effective source of repair, the new pricing policy could lower the annual cost of re pairs by a total of about $500 million over five years. Currently, the prices that depots charge for repairing DLRs include both the additional transportation, ma \u0010 terials, and labor costs that the depots incur in making the repairs and an allocated share of the depots' fixed overhead costs. Under this option, the prices charged for repairing DLRs would cover only those costs that vary with the number of DLRs being repaired in the depot\u2014 for instance, transportation, materials, and direct labor costs. Fixed costs that do not vary with the level of work \u0010 load\u2014including ov erhead\u2014would be covered througha flat charge paid by customers that would not depend on the level of workload. That two\u0010part pricing structure, which is similar to the pricing structures used by some telephone and utility companies, has been proposed as a cost \u0010saving initiative by economists at RAND, the Center for Naval Analyses, and elsewhere. The Air Force implemented a two \u0010part pricing system for DLRs on a test basis in 2002. A study by RAND concluded that two \u0010part pricing would reduce the prices that depots charge by more than one \u0010third in many cases. A price reduction of one \u0010third could shift a significant amount of the workload for DLRs now being done in local facilities to depots. That could in turn reduce the department's total cost of repairs because\u2014 according to studies by RA ND, the Navy, and the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD)\u2014maintenance done locally can range from 25 percent more expensive to twice as expensive as repairs done at depots. Although no set of accounting systems captures the total cost of repairs done in local facilities, OSD currently estimates that total cost to be in the range of $25 billion a year. If a two \u0010part pricing structure shifted just 2 per \u0010 cent of that local workload to depots, $500 million worth of repairs would be shifted each year, and DoD could realize savings of $125 million a year, on average, through 2008. Shifting some of that work to depots might also improve the quality of maintenance. Because local facilities are not as well equipped for some tasks as depots are, repairs can also take longer or have higher failure rates. In addition, the high prices currently charged by depots for repairs give local maintenance personnel an incentive to scavenge parts from a broken DLR to use in repairing others,54 BUDGET OPTIONS eventually sending the DLR on to a depot with multiple broken parts\u2014increasing labor and repair costs at both local facilities and the depots. One disadvantage of this option is that developing appro \u0010 priate prices for the depot facilities could prove difficult. Depot managers, eager to attract work by keeping their prices as low as possible, might try to move costs into the flat charge or direct appropri ations that were in fact part of their costs that varied with workload. Alternatively, depot managers might be reluctant to separate repair costs that varied with workload from those that were fixed because doing so would highlight their degree of excess capacity.Another concern about changing the price of repairs is the problem of predicting behavioral responses. The DLR pricing system that is currently being used was intended to encourage commanders to be more careful in their use of DLRs. Although it has had that desired effect, it has also created an inappropriate incentive to undertake re \u0010 pairs in local facilities. Although the potential benefits of a two\u0010part pricing system are significant, there is a risk that a new system might al so have unexpected and un \u0010 intended consequences.150 International Affairs Budget function 150 covers all spending on international programs by variou s departments and ag encies.

Eximbank offers subsidized direct loans, guarantees of private loans, and export credit insurance; OPIC provides investment financing and insurance against political risks; and TDA funds feasibility studies, orientation visits, training grants, and other forms of technical assistance. Appropriations in 2003 for Eximbank, OPIC, and TDA are $578 mil \u0010 lion, $64 million, and $47 million, respectively. This option would eliminate TDA and the subsidy ap \u0010 propriations for Eximbank and OPIC. The latter two agencies could not conduct any new financing or issue new insurance but would continue to service their exist \u0010 ing portfolios. Th ose changes would save $72 million in outlays in 2004 and $1.9 billion over five years (com \u0010 pared with the 2003 appropriat ions enacted on February 20, 2003, adjusted for inflation). Proponents of this option dispute the contribution that those agencies make to the economy. The value of exports supported by the agencies' programs is small\u2014less than 2 percent of total U.S. exports. Moreover, many econo \u0010 mists disagree with the claim that promoting exports creates U.S. jobs. They assert that by subsidizing exports, the government distorts business decisions that are best left to occur in free markets. OPIC and Eximbank fi \u0010 nance programs that would have trouble raising funds on their own merit. Similarly, those agencies' insurance pro \u0010 grams might encourage companies to invest in riskier projects than they would if more of their own funds were at stake. Opponents of this option argue that the three agencies play an important role in helping U.S. businesses, espe \u0010 cially small businesses, understand and penetrate overseas markets. Those agencies level the playing field for U.S. exporters by offsetting the subsidies that foreign govern \u0010 ments provide to their exporters, thereby creating U.S. jobs and promoting sales of U.S. goods. By encouraging U.S. investment in areas such as Russia and the states of the former Soviet Union, those agencies may also serve a foreign policy objective.

Nearly 80 percent of the projects a pproved in 2000 were in the private sector. At the end of that year, the EBRD had a portfolio of nearly 800 projec ts with a net value of $11.3 billion. The United States contributes 10 percent of the capitali \u0010 zation of the EBRD, or $36 million in 2003. The 2003 subscription (the buying of stock) is the sixth installment of an eight \u0010year capitalization agreement with the bank. This option would terminate U.S. subscriptions to the EBRD at the end of the eight \u0010year agreement, saving $75 million in outlays over five years\u2014if the level of U.S. sup \u0010 port remains steady. After the U.S. ends its subscriptions, the bank could be privatized. Proponents of this option say that loans from the United States or public entities to the private sector encouragebusinesses to make riskier investments than they would otherwise do if their decisions were based purely on market factors. That effect might seem inappropriate for a policy initiative designed to support market \u0010oriented reforms in formerly communist countries. Investments that respond to market conditions, including risk, are more likely to allocate capital in a cost \u0010effective manner and to promote economic growth. Proponents also note that the EBRD is showing a \"profit\"\u2014that is, its current repayments exceed its current outlays. Thus, the bank is making loans for investments that are potentially viable without subsidies from taxpayers. Opponents of this option argue that the funds are used to promote investment in a region that only recently made the transition to a market \u0010based economy and that the loans are important to the economic security of those countries. Without institutions such as the EBRD, oppo \u0010 nents argue, there would be less private investment and economic growth in the region.

Those research pro \u0010 grams were put into place when the prices of fossil fuels were controlled and, as a result, incentives for technology development were muted. In a world of partial de \u0010 regulation and increasingly free energy markets, the value of federal spending for such research and development (R&D) programs is questionable. Eliminating the re \u0010 search programs would save $151 million in federal out \u0010 lays in 2004 and $2.4 billion over the 2004 \u00102008 period. Supporters of this option contend that energy markets provide suppliers with sufficient incentives to develop better technologies and bring them to market. They argue that private entities are more attuned to which new tech \u0010 nologies have commercial promise than are federal offi \u0010 cials. Federal program s have had a long history of funding fossil\u0010fuel technologies that, although interesting tech \u0010 nically, had little chance of commercial implementation. As a result, much of the federal spending has not been productive.People who support eliminating the applied research pro \u0010 grams also argue that DOE should concentrate on basic energy research and reduce the department's involvement in applied technology development. They point out that the federal government has a clearer role in developing the basic science for a new energy source because the benefits of such investment are widespread and cannot be captured by individual firms. Opponents of eliminating the programs argue that they help offset several failures in energy markets and represent a sound investment for the nation. They say, for example, that energy prices do not reflect the environmental dam \u0010 age done by the production and use of fossil fuels. Re \u0010 search that allows coal to be used with less damage to the environment decreases the cost of its use to society. Those research programs could also increase the efficiency of energy use and thereby reduce dependence on foreign oil. People who oppose this option also point to the con \u0010 tinued development of fuel cell technology in these pro \u0010 grams. Fuel cells, which have come down in cost, are just a few years away from displacing more conventional en \u0010 ergy sources in a wide variety of markets, from cell phone batteries to household electrical use.

Those efforts include the FreedomCAR Partnership (discussed in option 270 \u001007) for automobile research as we ll as industrial and residen \u0010 tial energy \u0010efficiency research. Federal agencies' involve \u0010 ment in the selection and development of technologies with near\u0010term commercial prospects raises questions about the appropriateness of the current division of labor between the public and private sectors. Eliminating these programs would save $235 mi llion in outlays in 2004 and $2.7 billion over the 2004 \u00102008 period. People who support halting federal spending for energy conservation research and development (R&D) argue that the federal government should stay out of the develop \u0010 ment of applied energy technology and concentrate on basic research in the underlying science. Specifically, they note that many projects funded through this research effort are small and discrete enough\u2014and, in many cases, have a clear enough market\u2014to warrant private invest \u0010 ment. In such instances, DOE may be crowding out or preempting private \u0010sector firms. In other instances, such programs conduct R&D that the intended recipients are likely to find too expensive or esoteric to implement.Supporters of this option also note that other federal poli \u0010 cies encourage the introduction of some of the technolo \u0010 gies. For example, federal law sets minimum efficiency standards for appliances and cars. In addition, the tax code favors investments in conservation technologies. Thus, federal R&D programs may duplicate other sup \u0010 port. People who oppose eliminating the programs argue that federal R&D in energy conservation helps offset several failures in energy markets. Current energy prices, they contend, do not reflect the damage to the environment, including the potential for global warming, from exces \u0010 sive reliance on fossil fuels. In addition, they argue that energy conservation will decrease the social costs of pro \u0010 ducing and using energy and the nation's dependence on foreign oil. Opponents of eliminating DOE's programs also encourage cost sharing in some industrial grants, which may raise the rate of private R&D in the field. (Because energy conservation R&D and the Freedom \u0010 CAR Partnership overlap, the savings from eliminating both programs would be less than the sum of the figures for the two options. In addition to its own energy con \u0010 servation programs, DOE separately provides grants to state and local agencies for energy conservation. Those grants are discussed in option 270 \u001004.)

The largest such technology development efforts by far are those for developing alternative liquid fuels from biomass and electricity from photovoltaic cells. Smaller efforts involve electric energy storage and wind energy systems. Eliminating this research would save $142 million in outlays in 2004 and $1.6 billion over the 2004\u00102008 period. Supporters of this option argue that the federal govern \u0010 ment should stay out of the development of applied en \u0010 ergy technology and concentrate on basic research in the underlying science. Federally sponsored researchers lack the market incentives and information that help re \u0010 searchers in private companies recognize marketable tech \u0010 nologies. Another criticism applicable to DOE's conservation R&D programs (discussed in option 270 \u001002) is that many of the research projects funded by the renewable energy program are sufficiently small and discrete and have a clear enough market to attract private funding. Several renewable energy technologies\u2014most notably wind power and photovoltaic cells\u2014are now at the heart of commercial markets. Wind energy, according to in \u0010 dustry estimates, currently constitutes a $6 billion market worldwide and has grown rapidly. Similarly, the photo \u0010 voltaic market is growing at between 20 percent and25 percent per year. In such cases, it may be time for an orderly withdrawal of federal support. Given the large U.S. venture capital market, continued federal support may be displacing private funding. Finally, supporters of this option explain that for liquid fuels derived from renewable resources, especially bio \u0010 mass, the federal tax code already provides incentives for developing the technology. Ethanol fuels receive special treatment under the federal highway tax (see Revenue Option 25). Furthermore, federal regulations authorized by many different statutes favor alcohol fuels, which now usually mean those that are corn \u0010based. By reducing the costs of alternative energy sources, oppo \u0010 nents of this option argue, DOE's programs have pro \u0010 vided some insurance against permanent increases in the price of oil. One 1999 analysis showed that many of the technologies had indeed met their goals to lower costs, although they were not used because costs for conven \u0010 tional energy sources had fallen by even more. Should en \u0010 ergy prices rise over the longer term, however, these new energy sources could gradually come into wider use. Opponents of eliminating the programs also argue that the energy prices consumers pay fail to incorporate the risks posed by the nation's dependence on fossil fuels. Furthermore, the United States plays the role of inter \u0010 national R&D laboratory for less developed countries, which often have much higher energy costs.

Implementing this option would save $100 million in outlays in 2004 and $1.2 billion over the 2004\u00102008 period.People who support this option question whether the programs actually work and whether the conservation actions they call for are not already promoted by other programs or laws, such as the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. The DOE programs duplicate a similar block \u0010 grant activity, the Low Inco me Home Energy Assistance Program, administered by the Departm ent of Health and Human Services. Moreover, federal support for reducing the use of gas and coal through conservation grants con \u0010 flicts with other federal policies that promote the produc \u0010 tion and use of those fuels. People who oppose this option claim that eliminating the grant programs could impose hardships on states that wish to continue their energy conservation efforts. Many states still rely heavily on such grants to help low \u0010income households and public institutions. In addition, the energy savings those programs effect could contribute to reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

Those PMAs sell power to customers at below \u0010market rates. The power generated by the PMAs comes largely from hydropower facilities that the Army Corps of Engineers and the Bureau of Reclamation have built and continue to operate. Current law requires that those sales be made at cost\u2014a pricing structure intended to ultimately reim \u0010 burse taxpayers for all of the costs of current operations and a share of the costs of construction and interest on the portion of total costs that has not been repaid. Inter \u0010 est charges are generally below the government's cost of borrowing. Those lower charges, along with the low cost of generating electricity from hydropower, result in power rates for customers that are significantly below the rates that other utilities charge. Current law also requires that PMAs first offer their power to rural electric coop \u0010 eratives, municipal utilities, and other publicly owned utilities. Restructuring would require that those three PMAs sell electricity at market rates to any wholesale buyer. Those higher rates would provide the federal government with about $640 million in added receipts over five years.Supporters of the restructuring maintain that the ra \u0010 tionale for federal power subsidies is weak. The market power of private utilities is checked by federal and state regulation of the power supply; by federal antitrust laws; and, increasingly, by competition from independent pro \u0010 ducers. In many cases, neighboring communities\u2014some receiving federal power and some not\u2014have similar char \u0010 acteristics. For households in the regions that the three PMAs serve, federal sales of power meet only a small share of their total power needs; therefore, the impact of increased federal rates on households' electricity costs would be modest. In addition , bolstering the case for increasing power rates now is the prospect of significant future costs for the PMAs to perform long \u0010deferred main \u0010 tenance and upgrades. Finally, selling power at below \u0010 market rates encourages the inefficient use of energy. People who oppose the option believe that restructuring could greatly increase electricity rates for the many small and rural communities served by PMAs. Opponents of restructuring also argue that continuing to provide low \u0010 cost federal power is necessary to counter the uncompeti \u0010 tive practices of investor \u0010owned utilities and to bolster the economies of certain regions of the country.

The Southeastern Power Administration (SEPA) of the Department of Energy sells electricity from hydropower facilities that the Army Corps of Engineers has con \u0010 structed and operates. SEPA pays private transmission companies to delive r that power to more than 300 whole \u0010 sale customers: rural cooperatives, municipal utilities, and other publicly owned utilities. Selling federal power assets would be consistent with the policy goal of increasing efficiency in energy markets. SEPA's power rates are designed to recover for taxpayers all of the costs of current operations, a share of the costs of construction, and a nominal interest charge on the portion of the total costs that has not yet been recovered. The average revenues from SEPA power are about 2.8 cents per kilowatt \u0010hour (kWh), compared with average revenues of 5.0 cent s per kWh for utilit ies in the region. Selling assets that directly support SEPA's supplying of electricity would provide the federal government with about $1.7 billion in added rece ipts over five years. That estimate reflects sale proceeds of about $1.9 billion minus a loss of receipts for that period of about $230 million. Over the 2004 \u00102013 period, added re ceipts would total $1.1 billion. Those figures do not include reduced discre \u0010 tionary outlays of about $75 million annually from end \u0010 ing appropriations to SEPA and the Corps for operations. The estimate of sale proceeds is based on SEPA's most recent audited statement of its assets and liabilities. The Corps's assets that would be transferred include equip \u0010 ment, such as turbines and generators, but not the relateddams, reservoirs, or waterfront properties. The sale would also include rights of access to that equipment and to the water flows necessary for power generation, subject to the constraints of competing uses for the water. Supporters of this option contend that the original rea \u0010 sons for establishing SEPA\u2014marketing low \u0010cost power to promote competition and fostering economic develop \u0010 ment\u2014are no longer compelling to many people because of the small amount of power that SEPA sells and because of competitive and regulatory constraints on power rates. Also, selling federal facilities does not mean transferring all functions in managing and protecting the water as a resource. The Corps could retain direct responsibility for managing water flows for all uses, including the upkeep of basic physical structures and surrounding properties. Or, as with other nonfederal dams, the terms of the fed \u0010 eral licenses to operate the facilities (issued by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission) could determine the management of water flows for competing purposes. People opposed to ending federal ownership believe that nonfederal entities lack the proper incentives to perform all of SEPA's functions. Many Corps facilities serve mul \u0010 tiple purposes, managing water resources for navigation, flood control, or recreation as well as for power genera \u0010 tion. Opponents also argue that selling SEPA could in \u0010 crease power rates. Although sales by SEPA meet only about 1 percent of the total power needs in the 11 states in which it operates, a few rural communities depend heavily on SEPA.

Fuel cells generate electricity by stripping out the electrons from hydrogen fuel. Recycling the electrons back into the remaining fuel mixture and combining it with oxygen produce air and water vapor emissions. This program replaces the Partnership for a New Genera \u0010 tion of Vehicles (PNGV), which focused on hybrid automobiles (cars with diesel and electric motors). Although the FreedomCAR Partnership will emphasize fuel cell vehicles and the infrastructure needed to support them, it will also sponsor research into combustion and emission systems, lightweight materials, and electronic and battery technologies suitable for energy \u0010efficient automobiles. The FreedomCAR Partnership comple \u0010 ments a larger effort, announced in the President's State of the Union address to the Congress, to develop hydrogen\u0010based sources of energy for automotive and other uses. The Department of Energy (DOE) will assume the lead federal role in the FreedomCAR Partnership. Eliminating funding for the program woul d save $55 million in out \u0010 lays in 2004 and $634 million over the 2004 \u00102008 period. However, because the FreedomCAR Partnership and DOE's energy conservation and renewable energy programs\u2014discussed in options 270 \u001002 and 270 \u001003, respectively\u2014are related, the savings from eliminating all of those programs would be less than the sum of the fig \u0010 ures for the three programs individually. Supporters of this option point out that the program that preceded FreedomCar, the PNGV, lagged in its efforts to create a production \u0010ready vehicle. Indeed, by early2003, the only hybrid vehicles available to American con \u0010 sumers were made by Honda and Toyota, two foreign automakers. Hence, the efficacy of yet another domestic research partnership between the public and private sec \u0010 tors in this area is questionable. This option's proponents note as well that domestic automakers have already begun conducting fuel cell research and that competitive pres \u0010 sures on them from their foreign competitors may spur those efforts. In 2002, Honda began leasing a fuel cell \u0010 powered vehicle in California, and Toyota made fuel cell vehicles available to government test fleets. Proponents contend, therefore, that economic incentives to undertake such efforts already exist in the private sector and that government financial support would simply represent corporate welfare without inducing greater research. Proponents also argue that instead of supporting applied research, the federal government could more effectively increase the efficiency of the nation's automotive fleet by raising gasoline taxes, user fees, or both. Such measures would increase the incentives for consumers to purchase energy\u0010efficient automobiles. They might also bring about more productive research, as automakers would have a greater incentive both to conduct research into fuel cell technology and to broaden their research efforts to include other potential sources of automotive fuel effi \u0010 ciency, such as more \u0010sophisticated drive trains and trans \u0010 missions and lightweight but durable chassis and body materials. Opponents of this option argue that imperfections in en \u0010 ergy markets and environmental considerations make government promotion of energy \u0010efficient technologies desirable, because private \u0010sector incentives to conduct research are less than those of society overall to see such research undertaken. They wo uld argue further that the disparity between private and societal incentives is exa \u0010CHAPTER TWO FUNCTION 270: ENERGY 67 cerbated by the fact that, relative to other investment projects competing for private \u0010sector dollars, the possi \u0010 bility of commercializing fuel cell vehicles is far off and fraught with risk. Hence, without government sponsor \u0010 ship, the private sector would underfund research in thisarea. From the perspective of the option's opponents, funding the FreedomCAR Partnership brings the future viability of reducing energy consumption through fuel cell technology to a level that more closely corresponds to the interests of society overall.

Consisting of four underground sites along the Gulf of Mexico, the SPR currently holds about 600 million barrels of oil and is about 85 percent full. The Department of Energy (DOE) can sustain a draw from the SPR at a maximum rate of about 4 million barrels per day (or 20 percent of the nation's current petroleum use) for about 90 days. The department has released oil in emergency circum \u0010 stances only three times: it released more than 17 million barrels during the Persian Gulf War to prop up the U.S. supply, nearly 3 mi llion barrels in fa ll 2000 to help estab \u0010 lish a heating oil reserve for the Northeast in anticipation of a frigid winter, and 500,000 barrels earlier in 2000 to aid a local refinery after a dry \u0010dock accident. The govern \u0010 ment's net investment in th e SPR is about $17 billion for oil and about $4 billion for storage and transportation facilities. At a pr ice of $25 per barrel, for example, that oil is valued at nearly $15 billion. This option would require DOE to reduce the size and excess capacity of the SPR by closing the smallest storage site, Bayou Choctaw in Louisiana, and selling the site's 71 million barrels of oil over a five \u0010year period (to mini \u0010 mize the impact of the sale on world oil prices). Receipts from the oil sales would be about $400 million in 2004 and would total $1.9 bi llion over the 2004 \u00102008 period. Appropriations for operating the reserve could be reduced after the site was decommissioned. The option conforms with past Congressional actions: in 1996 and 1997, the Congress directed DOE to sell SPR oil to offset spendingon the reserve and other programs. DOE is currently adding to the SPR's holdings in the absence of new ap \u0010 propriations for purchases. Royalties owed to the federal government by private companies are being taken in kind, rather than cash, and diverted to the reserve (about 23 million barrels thus far). And DOE has entered into exchange agreements with oi l companies that have bor \u0010 rowed government oil or used SPR facilities, repaying the government with oil (about 10 million barrels). (This option does not include any budgetary savings from not operating the closed site or from avoiding government losses in those swap programs.) Proponents of this option contend that reducing the SPR is supported by changes in the reserve's benefits and costs since 1975. Structural changes in energy markets and the economy at large have lowered the potential costs of a disruption of oil supplies and consequently the benefits from releasing the oil in a crisis. The Middle East remains an unreliable source of oil because of continuing tensions in the area. However, the increasing diversity of world oil supplies and the growing integration of the economies of oil\u0010producing and oil \u0010consuming nations lessen the risk of a sustained widespread disruption. Moreover, DOE's experience with selling oil during the Persian Gulf War and at other recent times indicates that the process of deciding to release oil and establishing its price can contribute to market uncertainty, diminishing the bene \u0010 fits of a release. The rising costs of maintaining the SPR also strengthen the case for this option: many of the SPR's facilities are aging and have required unanticipated spending for repairs.CHAPTER TWO FUNCTION 270: ENERGY 69 Opponents of closing the site and selling the oil stress logistical and pricing concerns. Closing Bayou Choctaw could reduce DOE's flexibility in distributing oil from a drawdown, especially in the Mississippi Valley. Pipe \u0010 lines from that site connect to refineries that would other \u0010 wise be costly to supply. And selling SPR oil could ad \u0010versely affect domestic oil producers, a concern that prompted the Congress to repeal legisl ation in 1998 requiring oil to be sold. The President has stated the goal of filling the SPR to its cu rrent capacity of 700 million barrels.

The TVA is supposed to set electricity rates on the basis of its costs so that over time, receipts from its sales will be sufficient to pay for routine operations, depreciation of productive assets, and certain other activities. Current rates, however, are not sufficient to pay off the $4.1 billion th at the TVA has invested in certain nuclear power plants that have never been com \u0010 pleted. It may be difficult for the TVA to raise funds to recover the costs of those uneconomic investments, for a number of reasons. First, the TVA's market may be opened to competition at some point, raising the pressure to keep rates low. Second, the TVA recently signed at least one contract that protects its customers from being charged after 2007 for the agency's uneconomic investments. Third, the TVA has other liabilities to cover that it has financed through leasebacks and other nontraditional means. Those arrangements have raised concerns about circumventing the $30 billion statutory limit on the agency's debt. If the TVA fails to recoup the costs of in \u0010 vestments through increased rates, the burden may fall on taxpayers nationwide. This option would require the TVA to impose a sur \u0010 charge on electricity transported over its transmission sys \u0010 tem, regardless of the source, to recover a portion of its past costs. That transmission surcharge would have cus \u0010 tomers in the TVA's traditional service area pay for the past costs, even if they switched suppliers. The surchargewould be set to recoup $2.4 billion of the TVA's $4.1 bil \u0010 lion investment in uneconomic assets over a period of 10 years. (The option would also redefine the TVA's debt limit to include related liabilities arising from long \u0010term contracts and gradually scale back that limit to $20 bil \u0010 lion\u2014or $5 billion below the current level of outstanding debt\u2014to ensure that revenues collected from the sur \u0010 charge would go toward lowering the agency's debt bur \u0010 den.) Added re ceipts would total $1.1 billion over the 2004\u00102008 period. Supporters of this option would contend that a surcharge on transmission services would lessen the possibility that taxpayers\u2014rather than the TVA's customers\u2014were sad \u0010 dled with the cost of its past uneconomic investments. The surcharge would produce additional receipts for the agency over the next 10 years. It would also protect the TVA's sales base because it would apply to all sales of electricity in its historical service area. Many states have authorized similar tariff surcharges to help local utilities recover the costs of investments that became uneconomic with the introduction of competition at the wholesale level. Opponents of the option might argue that if charges for past investments made the TVA's rates uncompetitive, the region could suffer. They also might argue that re \u0010 quiring a transmission surcharge would constrain the TVA's ability to formulate efficient plans for paying off uneconomic investments. The most efficient solution, for example, might be for the TVA to write off a portion of the $4.1 billion invest ment in de ferred nuclea r assets at taxpayers expense.

The spending necessary to make those sales in some cases exceeds the receipts paid to the gov \u0010 ernment. As a result, questions have arisen about whether those sales should be made. In 1998, the FS sold roughly 3 billion board feet of pub \u0010 lic timber. Purchasers may harvest the timber over several years and pay the FS upon harvest. The total 1998 har \u0010 vest, 3.3 billion board feet, represented a plateau follow \u0010 ing a decline in volume over previous years. According to the FS's Forest Management Pr ogram Annual Reports , in recent years, the FS spent more on the timber program than it collected from companies harvesting the timber. In 1998, the expenses for the program reported by the FS exceeded the receipts by ab out $126 million. (Because of new depreciation procedures associated with road costs, 1998 figures are not directly comparable with those for prior years.) In calculating expenses, the FS excluded receipt\u0010sharing payments to states. With such payments included, expenses exceeded receipts by more than $338 million (or more than 60 percent) in 1998. The FS does not maintain the data needed to estimate the annual receipts and expenditures associated with each in \u0010 dividual timber sale. Therefore, it is hard to determine precisely the possible budgetary savings from phasing out all timber sales in the National Forest System for whichexpenditures are likely to exceed receipts. To illustrate the potential savings, however, this option estimates the re \u0010 duction in net outlays in the federal budget from elimi \u0010 nating all future timber sales in five National Forest Sys \u0010 tem regions for which expenditures significantly exceeded receipts in 1997 and 1998. In those five regions (the Northern, Rocky Mountain, Southwestern, Intermountain, and Alaska regions), cash expenditures exceeded cash receipts by at least 30 percent in 1997 and 1998. Eliminating a ll future timber sales from those regions would reduce the FS's outlays for 2004 by $76 million and by $411 million for the 2004 \u0010 2008 period. Timber sales for which spending exceeds receipts have several potential drawbacks in addition to their federal costs. They may lead to excessive depletion of federal tim \u0010 ber resources and the destruction of roadless forests that have recreational value. Potential advantages of those sales include mitigating forest stewardship costs and bringing stability to com \u0010 munities dependent on federal timber for logging and related jobs. Timber sales also provide access to the land \u2014as a result of road construction\u2014for fire protection and recreational uses.

The CWA provides financial assis \u0010 tance so communities can construct wastewater treatment plants that comply with th e act's provisions. The 1996 amendments to the SDWA auth orized a state revolving loan program for drinking water infrastructure. For 2003, the Congress appropriated about $2.6 billion for the Environ \u0010 mental Protection Agency's (EPA's) programs for waste \u0010 water and drinking water infrastructure. Phasing out all of EPA's funding of water facilities over three years would save $54 million in outlays in 2004 and $4.5 billion through 2008. Title II of the CWA provides fo r grants to states and muni \u0010 cipalities for constructing wa stewater treatment facilities. As amended in 1987, the CWA phased out title II grants and authorized a new grant program under title VI to sup \u0010 port state revolving funds (SRFs) for water pollution con \u0010 trol. Under the new system, states continue to receive fed \u0010 eral grants, but now they are responsible for developing and operating their own programs. For each dollar of title VI grant money a state receives, it must contribute 20 cents to its SRF. States use the combined funds to make low \u0010interest loans to communities for building or upgrading municipal wastewater treatment facilities. Although authorization for the SRF program under the CWA has expired, the Congress continues to provide annual appropriations for grants. As amended in 1996, the SDWA authorizes EPA to make grants to states for capitalizing revolving loan funds for treating drinking water. As with the CWA's wastewater SRFprogram, states may use those funds to make low \u0010cost fi\u0010 nancing available to public water systems for constructing facilities to treat drinking water. In 2003, the Congress ap \u0010 propriated $850 million for capit alization grants for drink \u0010 ing water SRFs. Proponents of eliminating federal grants to water \u0010related SRFs say such grants may encourage inefficient decisions about water treatment by allowing states to lend money at below\u0010market interest rates, which in turn could reduce in \u0010 centives for local governments to find less costly alternatives for controlling water pollution and treating drinking water. Proponents also argue that fe deral contributions to waste \u0010 water SRFs were originally viewed as a temporary step on the way to full state and local financing and that they may have replaced, rather than supplemented, state and local spending. Opponents of such cuts argue that the need for investments to replace aging infrastructure, reduce health threats in drinking water (from cryptosporidium, for example), and protect the nation's waters (from sewer overflows, for exam \u0010 ple) is so large that federal aid should be increased, not re \u0010 duced. They say that water systems in many small and eco \u0010 nomically disadvantaged communities will be unable to maintain service quality and comply with the CWA's and SDWA's new and forthcoming requirements without exter \u0010 nal assistance and that states cannot supply all of the needed funding. They further argue that eliminating the federal grants would mean that even many large systems, which tend to have lower costs because of economies of scale, would have to charge rates th at would pose significant hard \u0010 ships for low \u0010 and moderate \u0010income households.

However, authoriza \u0010 tion for the federal government to collect the holding and loca \u0010 tion fees expires in 2003. Estimates place the current gross value of the production of hardrock minerals at about $600 million annually (excluding claims with patent applications in process). That sum has di \u0010 minished greatly in recent years because of patenting activity. (In patenting, miners gain title to public lands by paying a one \u0010 time fee of $2.50 or $5.00 an acre.) This option would reautho \u0010 rize the current holding and location fees. It assumes that such fees would be recorded as offsetting receipts to the Treasury (they are currently counted as offsetting collections to appro \u0010 priations). The option also includes an 8 percent royalty that the Congress could impose on producers of hardrock minerals from public lands. That royalty would apply to net proceeds (defined here as revenues from sales minus costs for mining, separation, transportation, and other items).Total budgetary receipts from those actions would be $25 mil \u0010 lion in 2004 and $125 million over the 2004 \u00102008 period. Of that total, the reauthorization of holding and location fees would account for about $100 million and royalty collections for about $25 million. Those estimates assume that states in which the mining takes place would receive 10 percent of the gross royalty receipts. They also assume that no further patent \u0010 ing of public lands would occur. (In comparison, royalties based on gross proceeds would raise more money. In general, the costs of administering any royalty based on net proceeds could exceed those for a royalty based on gross proceeds.) People in favor of this option\u2014including many environmental advocates\u2014argue that low holding fees and no royalties make producing minerals on federal lands less costly than on private lands (where the payment of royalties is the rule). That policy, they contend, encourages ov erdevelopment of public lands, which may cause severe environmental damage. Reforming the law could promote other uses of those lands, such as recreation and wilderness conservation. Opponents of this option would argue that without free access to public resources, miners\u2014especially small ones\u2014would limit their exploration for hardrock minerals in this country. In addition, they might argue, royalties would diminish the profit \u0010 ability of many mines, leading to scaled \u0010back operations or clo \u0010 sure and adverse economic consequences for mining communi \u0010 ties in the West. Because many mineral prices are set in world markets, miners would be unable to pass along new royalty costs to consumers.

The federal government owns and manages just over 630 million acres of public lands, which have many purposes, including providing grazing for privately owned livestock. Cattle owners compensate the government for using the lands by paying grazing fees, but the fees may not give the public a fair return. The Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) administer grazing on public rangelands in the West. In 2001, ranchers were authorized to use about 16 million animal unit months (AUMs)\u2014a standard mea \u0010 sure of forage\u2014for grazing on those lands. In 1990, the appraised value of public rangelands in six Western states varied be tween $5 and $10 per AUM. A 1993 study indicated that th e Forest Service and BLM spent $4.60 per AUM in that ye ar to manage their range \u0010 lands for grazing. The 1993 fee, however, was $1.86 per AUM. Thus, the current fee structure may be well below market rates and also below the federal costs of adminis \u0010 tering the program. (The current fee is $1.35 per AUM.) The Public Rangelands Im provement Act of 1978 estab \u0010 lished the current formula fo r grazing fees. It uses a 1966 base value of $1.23 per AUM and makes adjustments to account for changes in beef cattle markets and in markets for feed, fuel, and other production inputs. The Congress has considered various proposals to increase grazing fees. The increase in federal receipts resulting from any such proposal depends on the degree to which ranchers reduce their use of AUMs in response to higher fees. This option would determine grazing fees for federal lands in each state the same way the particular state deter \u0010mines grazing fees on state \u0010owned lands. The government would implement this option over 10 years as existing permits expired. Added receipts in 2004 would be $5 million, and adde d receipts through 2008 would total $86 million. Those estimates ar e net of additional pay \u0010 ments to states, which wo uld total roughly $29 million in the 2004 \u00102008 period. The estima tes do not include any additional appropriations for range improvements that could result from added receipts. Proponents of this option believe that the low fees sub \u0010 sidize ranching and contribute to overgrazing and deteri \u0010 orated range conditions. They support the approach of following decisions made at the state level and reject the one\u0010size\u0010fits\u0010all nature of the current federal fee. State grazing fees and the means of calculating them vary widely by state and sometimes even within a state. Sup \u0010 porters of this option also point out that states' interest in the revenue received from both state and federal fees lessens any incentive to manipulate state fees to lower federal fees. Opponents of this option note that state rangelands may be more valuable than fede ral lands for grazing purposes. Therefore, some formulas used by states to establish fees may not reflect those differences in quality and conditions of use when applied to federal lands. Opponents could also argue that the administrative costs of using different procedures to set federal grazing fees in each state would be higher than those incurred under the current uniform federal fee structure. (This option does not consider pos \u0010 sible differences in administrative costs.)

The Army Corps of Engineers administers laws pertain \u0010 ing to the regulation of the nation's navigable waters. Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1890 re \u0010 quires the Corps to issue permits for work that would af \u0010 fect navigable waters or materials around those waters. Section 404 of the Clean Wate r Act requires the Corps to issue permits for dredging or placing fill material in navigable waters. In 2001, th e Corps received about 85,000 permit applications. By increasing fees for permits issued under sections 10 and 404, the Corps could re \u0010 cover a portion of its annual regulatory costs. Imposing cost\u0010of\u0010service fees on commercial applicants would gen \u0010 erate $10 million in rece ipts in 2004 and $94 million through 2008. Section 404 grew to become th e core of the nation's ef \u0010 fort to protect wetlands. As legally interpreted, the term \"navigable\" includes waters that would not convention \u0010 ally seem so, such as wetlands adjacent to navigable waters and perhaps wetlands adjacent to nonnavigable tributaries of traditional navigable waters; the terms \"dredge\" and \"fill\" encompass virtually any activity in which dirt is moved. As a result, the Corps has regulatory jurisdiction over many wetlands. (In the wake of a 2001 Supreme Court ruling, the extent of the Corps's jurisdiction over U.S. wetlands will ultimately be determined by federal agencies' interpretations of terms like \"adjacent\" and \"tributary\" that withstand the scrutiny of the courts.) Under section 404, the Corps must evaluate each applica \u0010 tion and grant or deny a permit on the basis of expert opinion and statutory guidelines. The bulk of the permits are quickly approved through outstanding general orregional permits, which grant authority for many low \u0010 impact activities. Evaluation of applications not covered by outstanding permits may require the Corps to conduct detailed, lengthy, and costly reviews. Currently, the fees levied for commercial and private permits are $100 and $10, re spectively. Government applicants do not pay a fee. That fee structure has not changed since 1977. Total fee co llections fall far short of covering the costs of administering the program, particu \u0010 larly for applications requiring detailed review. Proponents of higher fees for commercial applicants ar \u0010 gue that the party pursuing a permit\u2014not the general taxpaying public\u2014should bear the cost of the permit. Since the permit seeker is advancing a private interest whose benefits accrue to a private party, the cost should be borne by that party. Taxp ayers should not have to pay for something that advances the interests of a comparative few. Permit seekers oppose such fees because they do not want to pay the costs of a process that may ultimately deny them the right to use their land in the way they choose. The goal of the section 404 pr ogram, for example, is to advance a public interest by protecting wetlands. Some people argue that because society benefits from wetlands protection, often at the perceived expense of property owners, society should pay. Furthermore, they contend, the regulatory process that property owners must deal with is already onerous, so raising the permit fees would further infringe on property owners' rights.

The Army Corps of Engin eers spent about $600 million on the nation's inland wa terway system in 2001\u2014about 60 percent for operation and maintenance (O&M) and about 40 percent for new construction. Current law allows up to 50 percent of new inland waterway construc \u0010 tion to be funded by revenues from the inland waterway fuel tax, a levy on the fuel consumed by tow boats using most segments of the system. Imposing user fees that are high enough to fully recover both O&M and construction outlays for inland water \u0010 ways would generate $88 milli on in receipt s in 2004 and about $1.4 billion over five years. The receipts could be considered tax revenues, offsetting receipts, or offsetting collections, depending on the form of the implementing legislation. They could be raised by increasing fuel taxes, imposing charges for the use of locks, or imposing fees based on the weight of shipments and distance traveled. (The estimates do not take into account any resulting reductions in income tax revenues.) Advocates of this option contend that imposing higher fees on users of the inland waterway system could im \u0010prove the efficiency of its use by encouraging shippers to choose the most efficient transportation route. Moreover, user fees would encourage more \u0010efficient use of existing waterways, reducing the need for new construction to alleviate congestion. Further, user fees based on costs send market signals that help identify the additional projects likely to provide the greatest net benefits to society. But the effects of user fees on efficiency would depend largely on whether the fees were set at the same rate for all segments of a waterway or were based on the cost of each segment. Since costs vary dramatically by segment, systemwide fees would offer weaker incentives for the efficient use of resources. Opponents of this option argue that user fees might re \u0010 press economic development in some regions. Fees could be phased in to lessen those effects, but that approach would reduce near \u0010term receipts. Imposing higher user fees would also lower the income of barge operators and shippers in some regions, but those losses would be small in the context of overall regional economies.

The coastal plain is the yet \u0010 to\u0010be\u0010explored onshore area with perhaps the country's most promising oil \u0010production potential. It is also the least disturbed Arctic coasta l region\u2014valued for species conservation and used by indigenous people to support their daily lives. ANWR was established by the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act of 1980. The refuge serves to conserve fish and wildlife habitats, fulfill related inter \u0010 national treaty obligations, provide opportunities to con \u0010 tinue indigenous lifestyles, and protect water quality. The law prohibits industry activity on ANWR's coastal plain unless specifically authorized by the Congress. This option would open ANWR's coastal plain to oil and gas production. The federal government would receive proceeds from auctioning oil and gas development rights and (once production begins) royalties. This option, as do some proposals, incorporates the assumption that the federal government receives one \u0010half of the offsetting re \u0010 ceipts from those sources and the state of Alaska receives the other half. For this estimate, the Congressional Budget Office as \u0010 sumed an average price of $22 per barrel (in 2003 dollars)during the 2013 \u00102045 period, on the basis of price pro \u0010 jections from the state of Alaska, the Energy Information Administration, and other sources. With oil selling for $22 per barrel (delivered to the West Coast), the Depart \u0010 ment of the Interior estimates a 50 percent probability that at least 2.5 bi llion barrels of oi l will be produced. Using that mean resource assessment and assuming that lease sales are held in 2006 and 2008, CBO estimates that leasing ANWR will generate receipts of about $4.2 billion over five years (with half of that amount going to Alaska). Arguments in favor of this option include the national security advantages of reducing dependence on im ported oil. Most of ANWR would remain closed to develop \u0010 ment, and the part of the coastal plain that would be directly affected by oil drilling and production represents less than 1 percent of the refuge. Moreover, technological changes in the industry have improved its ability to safe \u0010 guard the environment. An argument against this option is the short \u0010term nature of the still uncertain gain from extracting a nonrenewable resource: it will not provide lasting energy security. The coastal plain is ANWR's most biologically productive area and sustains the biological productivity of the entire refuge. Opponents of leasing in ANWR point out that industrial activity poses a th reat to wildlife and the envi \u0010 ronment despite efforts to mitigate its impact.

This fee could be classified as a discre tionary offsetting collection or a mandatory offsetting receipt, depending on the speci fic language of the legislation establishing the fee. On March 31, 1998, the Supreme Court ruled that the harbor maintenance tax (as it applied to exports) violated the constitutional restriction that \"No tax or duty shall be laid on articles exported from any State.\" The federal government ceased collecting the tax on exports on April 25, 1998, but continued to collect the tax on im \u0010 ports. One way to replace the revenue formerly generated by the harbor maintenance tax is to develop a new system of harbor fees that is constitutional. Under such a system, the commercial users of U.S. ports would pay a fee based on port use rather than a payment based on cargo value. Such a fee would apply to imports, exports, and domestic shipments. Taxes currently levied on imports and domes \u0010 tic shipments would be rescinded. The fees would help support the operation, construction, and maintenance of harbors. The Army Corps of Engin eers now spends about $960 million (in 2000 dollars) annu ally for costs associated with operating, constructing, and maintaining commer \u0010 cial harbors nationwide. A major part of those activities is maintaining adequate channel depths. Replacing what remains of the harbor maintenance tax with a more com \u0010 prehensive fee on commercial port users would generate $150 million in re ceipts in 2004 and $950 million over the 2004\u00102008 period.Two arguments can be made for imposing a harbor maintenance fee. First, harbor maintenance activities, such as dredging by the Corps of Engineers, provide a commercial service to identifiable beneficiaries. Modern and well\u0010maintained ports save shippers money by allow \u0010 ing the use of larger vessels and by minimizing inland transport costs. Exporters currently make no payments directly associated with their use of port facilities. Second, imposing a harbor fee would be unlikely to decrease the use of ports because the fee would result in charges on users similar to the ones they recently paid under the re \u0010 scinded tax. Whether a new harbor fee would pass constitutional mus \u0010 ter is uncertain. Such a fee might be viewed by the Su \u0010 preme Court as an unconstitu tional export tax disguised by another name. A second legal concern with a fee pro \u0010 gram is whether it would violate international trade agree \u0010 ments, as several international trading partners allege of the harbor maintenance tax. Another drawback of the fee is that after several years, the cash it generated would not keep pace with the revenue that the rescinded tax on ex \u0010 ports would have generated: under the existing harbor maintenance tax on imports, tax collections based on the value of the goods shipped are projected to increase more quickly than the fee in this option, which would be tied to the costs of operating, constructing, and maintaining harbors.

Signed in April 1987, it lays out terms and conditions under which up to 55 U.S. \u0010flag commercial fishing vessels may use methods involving special nets (referred to as purse seine) to catch tuna in the territorial waters of 16 Pacific Island states, including Kiribati, Micronesia, and Papua New Guinea. Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan have similar treaties providing access to those waters for their tuna fleets. Associated with the treaty is an agreement on economic assistance paid by the United States to the South Pacific Forum Fisheries Agency\u2014from June 1993 through June 2002, it called for an annual payment of $14 million. In March 2002, the signatories co mpleted negotiations to amend and extend the treaty, agreeing on an annual eco \u0010 nomic assistance payment of $18 million from June 2003 to June 2012. The amendment has not yet been for \u0010 warded to the U.S. Senate for ratification. This option would terminate the U.S. government's payments to the South Pacific Forum Fisheries Agency. Savings would be $14 million in 2004 and would total $74 million over the 2004\u00102008 period. The expiring treaty also provided for an annual payment of $4 million by the U.S. tuna industry to cover license fees for up to 55 vessels as well as technical assistance tothe Pacific Island parties. (In addition, it called for the industry to cover the cost of a program under which ob \u0010 servers could board vessels for scientific, compliance, monitoring, and other pu rposes.) From June 1993 to June 2000, on average, 40 U.S. \u0010flag vessels had access to tuna in the territorial waters of the South Pacific Island states each year. Thus, industry payments per vessel, ex \u0010 cluding the cost of the observer program, averaged nearly $100,000 annually. The treaty ex tension in this option would lower the maximum number of vessel licenses to 45 and the annual industry payment to $3 million. People in favor of terminating U.S. economic assistance and not extending the treaty believe that taxpayers are supporting the access of private vessels to the territorial waters of the party states. The U.S. subsidy may in fact be encouraging the overexploitation of fisheries. People who oppose this option believe that the treaty is a vehicle through which the United States provides fi \u0010 nancial assistance in keeping with its foreign policy inter \u0010 ests to the nations in the South Pacific Forum Fisheries Agency. They argue that it is not a subsidy\u2014the fishing industry's own payments under the treaty are comparable with those made by non \u0010U.S. fleets. Those fleets obtain yearly licenses on a bilateral basis with any Pacific Island state of interest at a cost of 5 percent of the value of their previous year's catch.CHAPTER TWO FUNCTION 300: NATURAL RESOURCES AND ENVIRONMENT 81 300-10\u2014Discretionary Eliminate Federal Funding of Beach Replenishment Projects Total (Millions of dollars) 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2004-2008 2004-2013 Savings Budget authority 96 98 100 103 105 502 1,090Outlays 34 98 100 102 104 438 1,030 Each year, the Army Corps of Engineers partially funds and conducts several sand replenishment projects to counter beach erosion. That activity raises questions about the federal role in addressing what may be pri \u0010 marily local problems and the ultimate effectiveness of the replenishment efforts, regardless of who pays for them. The operations typically involve dredging sand from offshore locations and pumping it ashore to rebuild eroded areas. Typically, state and local governments share part of the cost. Ceasing federal funding for beach re \u0010 plenishment activities would reduce discretionary outlays by $34 million in 2004 and $438 million over the 2004 \u0010 2008 period. Beach replenishment projects have two primary motiva \u0010 tions: mitigating damage and enhancing recreation. Beaches act as a barrier to waves and protect coastal pro \u0010 perty from severe weather. Replenishing eroded beaches helps them maintain that protective function. And be \u0010 cause beaches are an important recreational resource in many areas, sand replenishment projects help to ensure that such areas continue to generate economic activity through tourism.Proponents of halting federal spending for beach replen \u0010 ishment argue that its benefits accrue largely to the states and localities in which the projects occur. Therefore, they reason, state and local governments should bear the proj \u0010 ects' entire cost, not the federal government. An argu \u0010 ment against any funding, federal or otherwise, of re \u0010 plenishment projects is their ultimate futility. Beach ero \u0010 sion is an irreversible natural process, and replenishment projects serve only to temporarily delay the inevitable natural shifting of beaches. A better long \u0010term solution, proponents argue, would be to accept the fact that beaches will shift over time and to remove the various retention structures that inhibit the natural flow of sand along beaches and sometimes exacerbate erosion. Opponents of eliminating federal funding argue that beach replenishment not only benefits specific states and localities but also serves the interests of nonresident beachgoers. They further cont end that it would be unfair to stop federal funding because municipalities and owners invested in beachfront property with the expectation of continuing federal support. Opponents also argue that in some cases, federal projects\u2014such as those intended to keep coastal inlets open\u2014contribute to beach erosion and that the federal government should bear part of the cost of replenishment in those cases.

This option would halt new appropria \u0010 tions for two of EPA's activities that are a part of the CCTI but may contribute few environmental benefits: the Energy Star and Green Lights programs for labeling energy\u0010efficient products and the Climate Wise program of public/private partnerships to encourage businesses to save energy.

Energy Star and Green Lights are product \u0010labeling pro \u0010 grams meant to encourage businesses to sell products that meet or exceed federal guidelines for energy efficiency and to raise consumers' awareness of energy \u0010efficient prod \u0010 ucts. The types of products that EPA has designated to receive the labels include lighting fixtures, home appli \u0010 ances, office equipment, home construction materials, and new houses. EPA also disseminates information on sellers of the labeled products and offers program parti \u0010 cipants some technical assistance in implementing changes that increase energy efficiency. The Climate Wise program helps businesses identify actions that may saveenergy and reduce their production costs\u2014by providing free pollution \u0010prevention and energy \u0010efficiency assess \u0010 ments, for instance. For the three programs, major bene \u0010 fits to participants are in the public recognition and free advertising that they receive for their efforts. People who advocate eliminating the partnership pro \u0010 grams question the actual energy savings they produce and whether any savings that do occur reduce greenhouse gas emissions. For example, putting a government label on products that already m eet governm ent standards may produce little gain. Furthermore, encouraging consumers to purchase an electric appliance identified by EPA's part \u0010 nerships rather than a less \u0010efficient gas appliance could actually increase carbon dioxide emissions because the carbon content of the coal used to produce electricity is so high. People who oppose eliminating the programs emphasize that saving energy may reduce emissions of greenhouse gases (primarily carbon dioxide) and other toxic or smog \u0010 producing elements. They also believe that EPA is ad \u0010 dressing market failures because consumers do not see the full public benefits of using energy \u0010saving products. In \u0010 sufficient consumer interest in energy efficiency may compound industry's reluctan ce to invest in uncertain new technologies.

In the Foreign Market Development Program, FAS acts as a partner in joint ventures with \"cooperators,\" such as agricultural trade associations and commodity groups, to develop markets for U.S. exports. Eliminating funding for that program would reduce outl ays by $24 million in 2004 and $160 million over five years. The Foreign Market Development Program, also known as the Cooperator Program, typically promotes generic products and basic commodities, such as grains and oilseeds, but it also covers some higher \u0010valued products, such as meat and poultry. The program's effectiveness and the extent to which it replaces private expenditures with public funds are uncertain. Supporters of this optioncontend that cooperators should bear the full cost of foreign promotions because the cooperators benefit from them directly. They also argue that the program's services duplicate USDA's Market Access Program and other activities. Eliminating the Cooperator Program, however, could place U.S. exporters at a disadvantage in international markets, because other countries provide support to their exporters. Regarding the issue of duplicative services, some critics of this option note that the Cooperator Pro \u0010 gram is distinct from other programs in part because it focuses on services to trade organizations and technical assistance. Moreover, some opponents of this option con \u0010 sider the program useful for developing markets that could benefit the overall economy.

Under current law, funding for the program wi ll increase from $125 million in 2004 to $200 million in 2006 and thereafter, the Con \u0010 gressional Budget Office estimates. Eliminating MAP would reduce outlay s by $635 million over the next five years. The program has been used to promote a wide range of products, most of them highly valued, including fruit, tree nuts, vegetables, meat, poultry, eggs, and seafood. About 25 percent of MAP's funding goes to promote brand\u0010name products. To promote such products, coop \u0010 eratives or small private companies must contribute a minimum of 50 percent of the promotion cost. To pro \u0010 mote generic products, trade associations and others must contribute at least 10 percent of the cost.Some supporters of this option argue that participants should bear the full cost of foreign promotions because they benefit directly from them. (The extent to which the program has developed markets or replaced private ex \u0010 penditures with public funds is uncertain.) In addition, some supporters note the possibility of duplication be \u0010 cause the Department of Agriculture provides marketing funds through the Foreign Market Development Pro \u0010 gram, administered by the Foreign Agricultural Service, and other activities. Many people also object to spending taxpayers' money on advertising brand \u0010name products. Opponents of this option argue that eliminating MAP could place U.S. exporters at a disadvantage in inter \u0010 national markets, because other countries support their exporters. Responding to concerns about duplication, some opponents note that MAP differs from other pro \u0010 grams partly because it focuses on foreign retailers and consumer promotions.

Insurance policies that farmers buy through the program are sold and serviced by private in \u0010 surance firms, which receive an administrative cost reimbursement according to the total amount of insur \u0010 ance premiums they handle. Firms also share underwrit \u0010 ing risk with the federal government and can gain or lose depending on the value of crop losses relative to the claims made. Overall, the companies typically gain. The General Accounting Office (GAO) has studied the crop insurance program, particularly the amount paid to the firms that service and sell the insurance policies. In a 1997 study, GAO concluded that the amount the pro \u0010 gram had paid those firms exceeded the reasonable ex \u0010 penses of selling and servicing the crop insurance policies. Partly on the basis of that information, the Congress cut the reimbursement rate for the benchmark crop insurance plan from 27 percent of pr emiums to 24.5 percent (with comparable reductions for other plans). This option would further redu ce the benchmark rate\u2014to 22.5 per \u0010 cent\u2014saving $48 million in outlays in 2004 and $265 million over the 2004 \u00102008 period. Proponents of this option believe that lawmakers could cut the reimbursement rate more deeply without sub \u0010 stantially affecting the quantity or quality of services pro \u0010vided to farmers. In addition to relying on GAO's analy \u0010 sis, they point to the dramatic expansion in business that followed enactment of the Federal Crop Insurance Re \u0010 form Act of 1994 and the Agri cultural Risk Protection Act of 2000. The crop insuranc e policies in force for 2002 totaled about $37 billion , which is about three times the level of the earl y 1990s. Total premiums grew correspondingly, but because of economies of scale, the costs of selling and servicing the policies probably grew by less. Therefore, proponents argue, further cuts to the benchmark reimbursement rate are appropriate. Finally, even if cuts caused firms to curtail some services to farmers, proponents claim that the results would not be significant or irreversible. Opponents of this option argue that further cuts would impair the ability of the crop insurance industry to sell and service insurance and would threaten farmers' access to insurance. If farmers lacked insurance, opponents contend, lawmakers would be more likely to resort to ex \u0010 pensive, special \u0010purpose relief programs when disaster struck, negating any apparent savings from cutting the reimbursement rate. Given the current drought condi \u0010 tions in some areas of the country and the failure last year of the largest insurance company participating in the program, cutting reimbursement rates would further reduce companies' profits, making it harder for them to maintain the services they now provide to farmers.CHAPTER TWO FUNCTION 350: AGRICULTURE 87 350-04\u2014Mandatory Impose New Limits on Farm Program Payments to Producers of Certain Agricultural Commodities Total (Millions of dollars) 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2004-2008 2004-2013 Savings Budget authority 156 180 187 180 180 883 1,654 Outlays 156 180 187 180 180 883 1,654 The government supports producers of certain com \u0010 modities, including wheat, feed grains, cotton, and rice, by giving them cash payments or cash \u0010equivalent bene \u0010 fits.1 Since 1970, the amount that a producer can collect of some or all of those payments has been subject to a dollar limit. The size of such limits and how they would be applied were subjects of m uch debate during Congres \u0010 sional consideration of the recently enacted Farm Security and Rural Investment Act.2 The new law sets limits that are similar to the ones that applied under the previous farm legislation. This option would adopt the tighter limits contained in the Senate \u0010passed version of the farm bill (S. 1731). Savings would total $156 million in 2004 and $883 million over five years. Producers are entitled to two different types of support payments under current law. First, they can receive fixed payments based on their historical production. Those payments are not affected by market prices. Second, producers may be entitled to additional payments, known as countercyclical payments, that depend on marketprices. In addition to those two types of support, pro \u0010 ducers can receive benefits from the commodity loan program, which essentially guarantees them a minimum price for their crop. Under that program, whenever a shortfall occurs, producers receive cash payments or bene \u0010 fits that amount to forgiveness of a portion of the com \u0010 modity loan. Commodity program payments are made to \"persons,\" including individuals, some partnerships, and other legal entities. Individual producers can qualify for payments through up to three different entities\u2014such as three dif \u0010 ferent farms. Thus, individuals are actually limited to receiving about twice the current farm payment limit of $105,000 per year ($40,000 per person fo r direct pay \u0010 ments and $65,000 per person for coun tercyclical pay ments). In theory, an ad ditional limit of $75,000 per person applies to commodity loan benefits, but that limit is not effective in most circumstances. This option would limit total fixed and countercyclical payments to an individual to $75,000 per year, compared with the current effective limit of $210,000 per person. Under this option, payments would go only to individ \u0010 uals and would be denied to other entities in which an individual participated. Finally, this option would impose an actual limit of $150,000 pe r individual per year on commodity loan program benefits. Those changes would reduce payments, particularly to large farming operations. Producers of cotton and rice would be affected to a greater degree than producers of other crops because cotton and rice tend to be produced on large farms, and the value of program benefits per acre1.

For an explanation of paymen t limits, see Jasper Womach, Commodity Program Payment Limits Under the 2002 Farm Bill , CRS Agriculture Policy and Farm Bill Briefing Book (CongressionalResearch Service, July 17, 2002).

Limiting farm program benefits has been an issue for many years. An appropriate limit depends on the per \u0010 ceived purpose of farm payments. Some policymakers hold that the purpose of payments should be to keep smaller, family farms in busi ness, particularly those thatare struggling financially. Lower payment limits do not necessarily increase payments to small producers, how \u0010 ever, but only constrain payments to larger operations. Still, some supporters of this option argue that cutting payments to large operations would slow the rate of loss of small farms by reducing farmers' financial incentives to expand their operations. Opponents of this option contend that larger payments help U.S. agriculture stay competitive in global markets. Some producer organizations have called for eliminating payment limits altogether. They say that restricting pro \u0010 gram benefits on the basis of size hurts the larger, more efficient farming operations that are better able to com \u0010 pete internationally.3.

Under the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990, the credit subsidy for those programs is the esti \u0010 mated net present \u0010value cost (over the lives of the loans) of projected defaults minus fees and recoveries, excluding ad \u0010 ministrative costs. The SBA's largest business credit pro \u0010 grams are the general business loan guarantee, or 7(a), pro \u0010 gram; the certified development company, or 504, program; and the small business investment company (SBIC) equity capital programs. Both the certified development company and SBIC loan programs operate without a federal subsidy. Reducing to zero the subsidy for all of the SBA's other major business loan guarantee programs would lower out \u0010 lays by $38 million in 2004 and $330 million over the 2004\u00102008 period. Under the 7(a) program, the SBA's largest loan program, the federal government can guarantee 85 percent of the principal for business loan s up to $150,000 and 75 percent of the principal for larger loans. Small business investment companies in the SBIC program (private investment firms licensed by the SBA) make equity investments and long \u0010 term loans to small firms, using their own capital supple \u0010 mented by SBA \u0010guaranteed debentures. In 1996, the Congress amended both the Small Business Act and the Small Business Investment Act to reduce subsidy rates and improve the performance of the SBA's business loan programs. One change the Congress made was to in \u0010 crease the fees paid by loan recipients for most business loans. Such fee increases help to reduce program costs be \u0010 cause the revenues from the fees cover some of the expenses if a borrower defaults. In 2001, the Congress decreased the fees to their current levels, which are determined by the amount of the loan guarantee. For loans of $150,000 or less,the guarantee fee is 1 percent of the guaranteed portion. For those loans, lenders are permitte d to retain 25 percent of the fee. For loans between $150,000 and $700,000, the SBA charges a 2.5 percent guarantee fee. For loans greater than $700,000, it charges a guarantee fee of 3.5 percent. Since 1996, the Congress has cut the percentage of each loan amount that the government guarantees under the 7(a) program from about 90 percent to the current level of about 75 percent. Reducing the guarantee rates further should in \u0010 duce banks to evaluate loan applications more carefully because the banks will share more responsibility for any losses from defaults. If banks used more care in approving SBA loans, the default rate would decline and the costs to the government decrease accordingly. Adjusting fees (and changing loan guarantee levels) to cover potential default losses could make the SBA's major business loan programs financially sound. As the subsid y rate declined to zero, the Congress would no longer ha ve to appropriate funds to cover the government's expected losses. Supporters of this option contend that subsidies are not necessary to encourage the priv ate sector to make financing available to small businesses. They also argue that the SBA's assistance serves only a tiny fraction of the nation's small businesses and that most of the programs' borrowers could obtain financing without the SBA's help. Opponents of this option believe that the SBA's assistance aids small businesses by filling a gap in financing when banks and other private sources do not provide loans for the purposes, in the amounts, or with the terms required by small\u0010business borrowers. Some opponents also argue against increasing program fees or decreasing guarantee rates because such changes would redu ce access to credit for small businesses.CHAPTER TWO FUNCTION 370: COMMERCE AND HOUSING CREDIT 91 370-02\u2014Discretionary Eliminate the Internationa l Trade Administration's Trade Promotion Activities or Charge the Beneficiaries Total (Millions of dollars) 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2004-2008 2004-2013 Savings Budget authority 217 279 288 297 306 1,387 3,076Outlays 163 244 278 294 303 1,282 2,953 The International Trade Administration (ITA) of the Department of Commerce runs a trade development program (which assesses the competitiveness of U.S. industries and promotes exports) and the U.S. and for \u0010 eign commercial services (which counsel U.S. businesses on exporting). The ITA charges some fees for its services, but those fees do not cover the cost of all such activities. This option would eliminate the ITA's trade promotion activities or charge the beneficiaries. Those changes would save $163 million in outlays in 2004 and $1.3 billion through 2008. Proponents of this option argue that trade promotion activities are better left to the firms and industries that stand to benefit from them than to the ITA. Opponents might argue that those activities are subject to some economies of scale; if so, having one entity (the federal government) counsel exporters on foreign legal and other requirements, disseminate knowledge of foreign markets, and promote U.S. products abroad might make sense. In that case, net federal spending could be reduced by charging the beneficiaries of those programs their full costs.Proponents also note that when beneficiaries do not pay the full costs of services, the ITA's activities effectively subsidize the industries involved. Those implicit subsidies are an inefficient means of helping the industries because they are partially passed on to foreigners in the form of lower prices for U.S. exports. Moreover, they result in the industries' products being sold abroad for less than their cost of production and sales and thus lower U.S. eco \u0010 nomic well \u0010being. Opponents of this option counter that fully funding the ITA's trade promotion activities through voluntary charges might not be possible. For example, in many cases, promoting the products of selected firms that were willing to pay for such promotion would be impossible without also encouraging demand for the products of other firms in the same industry. In those circumstances, firms would have an incentive not to purchase the services because they would be likely to receive the benefits whether they paid for them or not. Consequently, if the federal government wanted to charge beneficiaries for the ITA's services, it might have to require that all firms in an industry (or the industry's national trade group) decide together whether to purchase the services. If the firms opted to purchase them, all firms in the industry would be required to pay according to some equitable formula.

The objective of the ATP is to further the competitiveness of U.S. industry by help \u0010 ing convert discoveries in basic research more quickly into technological advances with commercial potential. The program awards resear ch and development (R&D) grants on the basis of merit to individual companies, independent research institutes, and joint ventures. The ATP's grants are limited to $2 million over a three \u0010year period when awarded to a single firm and require, on average, a matching commitment from private sources. The grants support research in generic technologies that have applications for a broad range of products as well as research that precedes product development. Elimi \u0010 nating the ATP would save $24 million in outlays in 2004 and $638 million over the 2004 \u00102008 period. The Administration and other supporters of this option argue that private investors ar e better able than the federal government to decide which research efforts should be funded. They argue that even when the federal govern \u0010 ment chooses \"a winner,\" it may be displacing private capital. The U.S. venture capital markets are the best developed in the world, supporters say, do an effective job of funding new ideas, and focus on many of the same research areas as the ATP. Furthermore, venture capital funds have grown enormously since the ATP was con \u0010 ceived. In the firs t three quarters of 2002, venture capital funds invested $16.9 billion, about 65 times the size of the ATP. In addition, according to industry sources, ven \u0010 ture capital firm s had another $90 bi llion in reserves committed to them but not yet invested. That size differ \u0010ential suggests that the ATP is funding work that would have been funded by venture capital firms. Responding to the criticism that the Advanced Tech \u0010 nology Program is merely displacing private and venture capital funds, opponents of this option point to a 2001 survey showing that 63 percent of the firms that applied for but did not win an ATP award did not proceed with R&D. Another 17 percent proceeded but on a much smaller scale. Only 5 percent of firms denied ATP funds went ahead with their R&D programs as originally designed. Opponents of this option argue that the survey shows that the ATP's selection process has been refined so as to reduce the overlap between projects that the ATP is likely to fund and those that private sources are likely to finance, even if the general research areas are similar. (That result is a change from an earlier survey by the General Accounting Office, which found that fully half of nonwinners were able to find private sources of fund \u0010 ing.) Furthermore, this option's opponents argue, venture capital firms spend only a small fraction of their funds on the very early stages of technology development\u2014the area in which the ATP concentrates its funding. Critics of this option also note that surveys of the ATP's award recipients indicate that the awards have accelerated the development and commercialization of advanced technology by two years or more in the majority of planned commercial applications. In addition, those sur \u0010 veys show that recipients are more willing to tackle high \u0010 risk technology development projects as a result of their grants, presumably increasing both the amount and the breadth of the R&D funded.

The non \u0010 profit centers are not owned by the federal government but are partly funded by it. The National Quality Pro \u0010 gram consists mainly of the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award, which is given to firms for achievements in quality. This option would eliminate MEP and the National Quality Program, reducing outlays by $17 mil \u0010 lion in 2004 and $418 million through 2008. Supporters of this option could question the need for the government to provide the technical assistance given by MEP. Many professors of business, science, and engineer \u0010 ing are also consultants to private industry, and other ties between universities and private firms facilitate the trans \u0010 fer of knowledge. In fact, some of the centers that MEP subsidizes predate the program. Advocates of eliminating MEP also could question the program's positive effect on productivity. Federal spend \u0010 ing for MEP represents a subsidy for the firms that the program helps. In most cases, subsidies allow inefficient firms to remain in business, tying up capital, labor, and other resources that would otherwise be used more pro \u0010ductively elsewhere. For 2004, the Administration pro \u0010 poses eliminating the federal contribution to all centers with more than six years' experience\u2014a substantial total reduction\u2014in line with what it argues is the original de \u0010 sign of the program. Opponents of this option point to the economic impor \u0010 tance of small and midsize firms, which produce more than half of U.S. output and employ two \u0010thirds of U.S. manufacturing workers. Small firms, they argue, often face limited budgets, a lack of expertise, and other bar \u0010 riers to obtaining the information that MEP provides. Those circumstances and the substantial reliance of larger firms on small and midsize companies for supplies and intermediate goods lead opponents of this option to argue that MEP promotes U.S. productivity and international competitiveness. In regard to the National Quality Program, proponents of this option could argue that businesses need no gov \u0010 ernment incentives to maintain quality\u2014the threat of lost sales is sufficient. Furthermore, winners of the Baldrige Award often mention it in their advertising, which means they value it. If so, supporters of this option say, they should be willing to pay contest entry fees large enough to eliminate the need for federal funding. Critics of this option counter that the National Quality Program pro \u0010 motes U.S. competitiveness.

Currently, deposit insurance premiums are assessed on about 10 percent of all banks and thrift institutions; the remainder pay nothing for deposit insurance even though they pose some risk of loss for the government. This option would apply to banks and thrifts the FDIC's rate schedule for ba nks that was in e ffect before 1996; as a result, the vast majority of institutions that do not pay deposit insurance premiums now would pay a premium of 4 basis points (4 cents per $100 of deposi ts) per year. (The FDIC's current schedule of insurance premiums ranges from zero to 27 basis points.) That change would increase receipts to the government by $1.4 billion in 2004 and $4.8 billion ov er five years. The Deposit Insurance Fund Ac t stipulated that when the accumulated reserves of a de posit insurance fund exceed 1.25 percent of insure d deposits, the FDIC is prohibited from charging premiums of all but the riskiest institu \u0010 tions. The risk classification of a bank or thrift is based on the amount of capital it holds, the quality of its assets, the effectiveness of its management, and other factors. When insurance fund rese rves fall below 1.25 percent of insured deposits, the FDIC must raise rates sufficiently to increase the reserve rati o to 1.25 within a year. The Congressional Budget Office projects that, under current law, the accumulated reserves in the Bank Insurance Fund may fall below the 1.25 percen t target balance in 2003,largely because of growing deposits in banks that cur \u0010 rently pay no premiums. Proponents of this option argue that there are several rationales for charging all banks and thrifts some deposit insurance premium even when insurance funds' reserves exceed 1.25 percent of insured deposits. First, that target level of reserves bears no relation to expected losses. Sec \u0010 ond, even institutions in the best risk category pose some risk of failure over time and consequently should pay some premium, just as private insurers impose some premium on even the best risks. Third, recent experience indicates that some failures occur abruptly from risks that cannot be easily quantified or tracked, such as fraud or losses by rogue traders. A disadvantage of this option is that the 4 \u0010basis\u0010point premium, which would be paid by most institutions, is only a crude approximation of the risks they pose. Some institutions would be charged too much and some too little. Ideally, a more accurate risk \u0010based system of premi \u0010 ums, including some charge to the least risky institutions, could be reinstated. Opponents of this option contend that the current level of reserves provides ample protection to taxpayers. They argue that a strengthened regulatory regime and better risk\u0010management practices make a repeat of the bank and thrift crisis of the 1980s hi ghly unlikely. In addition, banks and thrifts may pass the cost of deposit insurance on to borrowers and depositors. To the extent that depositors undervalue FDIC insurance, banks might be put at a competitive disadvantage in attracting deposits compared with uninsured substitutes such as money market mutual funds.

After more than a quarter century of federal subs idies, in 1997 lawmakers enacted the Amtrak Reform and Accountabil \u0010 ity Act, which directed Amtrak to take a more business \u0010 like approach to operations so that it would not need fed \u0010 eral subsidies afte r December 2002. For several years after that law was enacted, Amtrak reported to the Congress that it was on a \"glide path\" toward the achievement of operating self \u0010sufficiency by the deadline. In the spring of 2002, however, Amtrak anno unced that it could not meet the deadline and that the goal of operating self \u0010 sufficiency was\u2014and always had been\u2014unrealistic. By early summer of 2002, Amtrak was rapidly running out of cash to run its operations. In addition to a federal subsidy of $521 million provid ed through appropriation legislation for fiscal ye ar 2002, Amtrak sought and re \u0010 ceived a federal loan of $100 million in July. In addition, it received $205 mi llion in supplemen tal appropriations to get through the rest of the fiscal year. Under this option, federal subsidies would be reduced by the amount currently needed to support train operations on the routes that lose the most money. According todata from Amtrak's Route Profitability System, the five trains that lost the most money accounted for losses of about $250 million in 2001. Cu tting that amount from Amtrak's subsidies each ye ar would save $278 million in 2004 and nearly $1.5 billion through 2008. Proponents of this option generally favor having the rail \u0010 road act more like a business. They suggest that Amtrak should cut service on routes that have attracted so few riders that Amtrak incurs large losses on each train it op \u0010 erates and that it should focus on the routes for which demand is greater. If passenger revenues were not suffi \u0010 cient to cover the cost of operating a train but states val \u0010 ued the service, the states could provide additional sub \u0010 sidies to help cover costs. Otherwise, travelers could use buses, airplanes, or cars to reach their destinations. Opponents of this option generally regard Amtrak as a public service that should be available on a nationwide basis without regard to cost. They contend that passen \u0010 gers on lightly traveled routes have few transportation alternatives and that the railroad is vital to the survival of small communities along those routes. Moreover, they suggest that improving service throughout the system could attract more passengers and make rail transporta \u0010 tion more viable economically.

The program provides subsidies to air carriers serving small communities that meet certain criteria. (Subsidies are available for service to communities only if they are 70 miles or more from a large or medium \u0010sized hub airport, except in Alaska and Hawaii.) In 2002, subsidies su pported air service to 114 U.S. communities, including 31 in Alaska (for which separate rules apply). The number of passengers served annually has fluctuated in recent years, as has the subsidy per passenger, which has ra nged from $6 to $400. The Congress has directed that such subsidies not exceed $200 per passenger unless the community is more than 210 miles from the nearest large or medium \u0010sized hub airport. This option would eliminate the EAS program, saving $547 million in mandatory outlays from 2004 through 2008.Supporters of this option contend that the EAS subsidies are excessive, providing air transportation at a high cost per passenger. They also maintain that the program was intended to be transitional and that the time has come to phase it out. If states or communities derive benefits from service to small communities, the states or com \u0010 munities could provide the subsidies themselves. Opponents of this option believe that the subsidy pro \u0010 gram prevents the isolation of rural communities that would not otherwise receive air service. Because the avail \u0010 ability of airline transportation is an important ingredient in the economic development of small communities, without it some towns might lose a sizable portion of their economic base, opponents claim.

Outlays are discretionary. Under the Airport Improvement Program (AIP), the Fed \u0010 eral Aviation Administration (FAA) provides grants to airports to expand runways, improve safety and security, and make other capital investments. Over the period from 1982 to 2002, about 40 percent of the AIP's fund \u0010 ing went to large and medium \u0010sized hub airports\u2014the 70 or so airports that together account for nearly 90 per \u0010 cent of passenger boardings. This option would eliminate the AIP's funding for those airports but would continue grants to smaller airports at levels consistent with those of 2003\u2014assuming that smalle r airports will receive about 60 percent of the $3.2 billion made available in 2003, or about $1.9 billion. AIP funding is subject to distinctive budgetary treatment. The program's budget authority is provided in authoriza \u0010 tion acts as contract authority, which is a mandatory form of budget authority. The spending of contract authority is subject to obligation limitations, which are contained in appropriation acts. Therefore, the resulting outlays are categorized as discretionary. Under this option, both bud \u0010 get authority and obligation limitations would be re \u0010 duced, saving $4.8 billion over the 2004 \u00102008 period.Supporters of this option assert that larger airports do not need federal funding and that federal grants simply sub \u0010 stitute for funds that could be raised from private sources. Because they serve many passengers, those airports gen \u0010 erally have been able to finance investments through bond issues and through passenger facility charges and other user fees. Smaller airports may have more difficulty raising funds for capital improvements, although some have been quite successful in tapping the same sources of funding as their larger counterparts. By eliminating grants to larger airports, this option would focus federal spend \u0010 ing on airports that appeared to have the fewest alterna \u0010 tive sources of funding. People who oppose this option argue that the controls exerted by the FAA as conditions of receiving aid ensure that the airports will continue to make investment and operating decisions that promote a safe and efficient avia \u0010 tion system.

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) runs a large regulatory program to ensure safe air travel. It oversees and regulates the registration of aircraft, licensing of pilots, issuance of medical certificates, and other similar activities. The FAA issues most licenses and certificates free of charge or at prices well below its costs. For ex \u0010 ample, the current fee to regist er an aircraft is $5, but the FAA's cost of providing the service is closer to $30. The FAA estimates the cost of issuing a pilot's certificate to be $10 to $15, but the agency do es not charge for the cer \u0010 tificates. Imposing or raising fees to cover the costs of the FAA's regulatory services could increase receipts by an estimated $25 million over the 2004\u00102008 period. Added receipts could be somewhat smaller if the FAA needed ad \u0010 ditional resources to establish and administer the fees.The Drug Enforcement Assist ance Act of 1988 authorizes the FAA to impose several registration fees as long as they do not exceed the agency's costs for providing the ser \u0010 vices. For general aviation, the law allows fees of up to $25 for aircraft regi stration and up to $12 for pilots' cer \u0010 tificates (plus adjustments for inflation). Setting higher fees would require additional legislation. As supporters of this option point out, FAA fees based on the cost of services would be comparable with auto \u0010 mobile registration fees and operators' licenses and thus would probably be modest, especially when compared with the total cost of owning an airplane. People who op \u0010 pose this option contend that increasing regulatory fees might burden some aircraft owners and operators. That effect could be miti gated by setting registration fees ac \u0010 cording to the size or value of the aircraft rather than on the basis of the FAA's cost.

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) operates the air traffic control (ATC) system, which serves commercial air carriers, the military, and smaller users, such as air taxis and operators of privat e corporate and recreational aircraft. Traffic controllers in airport towers, terminal radar approach control facilities (TRACONs), and air route traffic control centers (ARTCCs) help guide aircraft safely as they taxi to the runway, take off, fly through designated airspace, land, an d taxi to the airport gate. Other ATC services include flight service stations that provide weather data and other information useful to small\u0010aircraft operators. This option would impose fees for ATC services that reflect the FAA's marginal costs of providing the services. The marginal costs of a flight equal the costs of every ATC service (or contact) provided for that flight. For example, a commercial flight from New York to San Francisco entails contacts with two airport towers, two TRACONs, and seven ARTCCs. Under this option, the airline would pay the sum of the marginal costs of those contacts. A 1997 FAA study estimated total marginal costs for all airlines operating in the United States to be about $2 billion a year.Fees based on marginal costs would affect various types of airline operations differently. Carriers mainly using hub\u0010and\u0010spoke networks would probably face higher fees than those providing nonstop origin \u0010to\u0010destination flights because of differences in the number of contacts with towers, TRACONs, and ARTCCs. Supporters of this option assert that imposing fees for marginal costs would encourage efficient use of the ATC system. Noncommercial users might reduce their use of ATC services, freeing controllers for other tasks and in \u0010 creasing the system's overall capacity. By analyzing the pattern of revenues from us er fees, FAA planners could better decide on the amount and location of additional investments in the ATC system, which would make it more efficient. Opponents contend that this option would raise the cost of ATC services to users. Such a move could weaken the financial condition of some commercial air carriers. As \u0010 suming that the airlines would pass along most of the increase in cost to their customers, the Congressional Budget Office would expect some decrease in dem and for aviation services under this option.

The function of the Federal Railroad Administration's (FRA's) rail safety activities is to protect railroad employ \u0010 ees and the public by ensuring the safe operation of pas \u0010 senger and freight trains. Field safety inspectors are re \u0010 sponsible for enforcing federal safety regulations and standards. Other functions include issuing standards, procedures, and regulations; administering post \u0010accident and random drug testing of railroad employees; providing technical training; and managing highway grade \u0010crossing projects. Railroad safety fees, which had been authorized in the Omnibus Budget Reconcilia tion Act of 1990, expired in 1995. Before that year, railro ads were subject to those fees, which covered the safety enforcement and admini \u0010 strative costs of carrying out the FRA's mandated safety activities. The fees offset a portion of federal spending on safety programs.This option would impose new user fees to offset the costs of the FRA's rail sa fety activities\u2014totaling $325 million over five years. People in favor of this option con \u0010 tend that the specific recipients of government services should bear the costs.

In authorizing $171 billion in funding for the Federal \u0010 Aid Highway program over the 1998 \u00102003 period, the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA \u0010 21) designated near ly $9.4 billion for 1,851 high \u0010priority projects. For those projec ts, in 2002 the Congress pro \u0010 vided nearly $1.8 billion in TEA \u001021 funding.

The budgetary treatment of the Federal \u0010Aid Highway program is unusual. Budget authority is provided in au \u0010 thorization acts as contract authority, which is a manda \u0010 tory form of budget authority. The spending of contract authority is subject to obligation limitations, which are contained in appropriation acts. Therefore, the resulting outlays are classified as discretionary. To achieve bud \u0010 getary savings, this option would require the modification of TEA\u001021 to cut spending authority by an amount equal to that provided for the high \u0010priority projects. Under this option, both budget authority and obligation limitations would be reduced, saving $190 million in 2004 and $4.7 billion over the 2004 \u00102008 period.For the bulk of the Federal \u0010Aid Highway program, states set priorities and choose projects within certain broad categories established by the federal government. Sup \u0010 porters of this option contend that Congressional ear \u0010 marking for high \u0010priority projects subverts the states' pro \u0010 cesses of establishing priorities for highway spending.

Moreover, annual federal aid to states for highways surged under TEA \u001021\u2014from about $20 billion in 1997 to $33 billion in 2002\u2014the reby giving states the resources to fund more projects. Opponents of this option respond that the states' project \u0010 ranking models do not necessarily include all of the im \u0010 portant factors (or give them sufficient weight) in setting overall priorities. Members of Congress, who are in touch with the needs of their states and districts, may balance the process by designating exceptional projects that merit consideration.

In 2002, the federal govern\u0010 ment provided $3.5 billion in formula funding for a wide variety of transit projects. The budgetary treatment of transit funding is complex. A portion of the budget authority for the New Starts pro \u0010 gram is provided in authorization acts as contract author \u0010 ity, which is a mandatory form of budget authority. The spending of contract authority is subject to obligation limitations, which are contained in appropriation acts. Therefore, the resulting outlays are categorized as discre \u0010 tionary. The remainder of the budget authority is pro \u0010 vided in appropriation acts and is considered discretion \u0010 ary. Under this option, discretionary budget authority, contract authority, and obligation limitations would all be reduced, saving $239 mi llion in 2004 and $4.9 billion over the 2004 \u00102008 period.Supporters of this option argue that new rail transit sys \u0010 tems tend to provide less value per dollar spent than bus systems do. Bus systems require much less capital, and they are more flexible in their ability to adjust schedules and routes to meet changing needs. Moreover, supporters contend that letting the federal government dictate how communities should spend federal aid for transit is inap \u0010 propriate and inefficient because local officials know their needs and priorities better than federal officials do. Those opposed to this option contend that the suburban sprawl resulting when families and businesses move out of central cities leads to increasing congestion and pollu \u0010 tion. Building additional roads will not solve the problem but only leads to greater decentralization and sprawl, they argue. New rail transit systems, in contrast, can help channel future development into corridors where public transportation is available, as companies and residential developers locate where they can attract employees by offering easy and reliable access to the workplace.

One of the most sweeping changes resulted from the Aviation and Transportation Security Act (Pub \u0010 lic Law 107 \u001071), which made the federal government, rather than airlines and airports, responsible for screening airline passengers, carry \u0010on luggage, and checked baggage. The new standards for screening have raised costs by re \u0010 quiring a larger number of screeners with higher qualifi \u0010 cations (thus necessitating higher compensation). To help pay for increased security, the law authorized air \u0010 lines to charge passengers a fee of $2.50 each time they board a plane (capped at $5 for a one \u0010way trip). The law also authorized fees on the airlines themselves. In addi \u0010 tion, it authorized funds to reimburse airport operators, service providers, and airlines for additional costs of security enhancements. The Congressional Budget Office expects that the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) will collect about $2.1 billion from the fees in 2004; that amount, however, is less than half of the esti \u0010 mated $4.7 billion incr ease in costs to the federal govern \u0010 ment. Under this option, user fees would be raised so that they would fully cover the costs of the added security measures. For 2003, appropriations for the TSA are about $4.5 bil \u0010 lion. Of that amount, CBO estimates that about $2.0 bil \u0010 lion will be financed by collections from existing charges imposed on passengers and airlines, including the board \u0010ing fee of $2.50 per passenger . Imposing charges that would cover the entire cost of security improvements\u2014 for instance, by increasing the bo arding fee to $6.25\u2014 would boost collections (and thus reduce net discretion \u0010 ary spending) by an estimated $2.6 billion in 2004 and $14.1 billion over the 2004 \u00102008 period. Standard bud \u0010 getary treatment of such collections would classify them as revenues, but because the Aviation and Transportation Security Act requires that revenues from the existing fees be recorded as offsetting collections (a form of discre \u0010 tionary spending), under this option the additional fees would be treated the same way. Supporters of this option contend that the primary bene \u0010 ficiaries of the increased transportation security are the users of the system. Security is a cost of airline transporta \u0010 tion, in the same way that fuel and labor costs are. Hav \u0010 ing those costs covered by taxpayers in general\u2014not just users of the aviation system\u2014would provide a subsidy to air transportation. Opponents of this option argue that the public in general, not just air travelers, benefits from improved airport se \u0010 curity. To the extent that enhanced security reduces the risk of terrorist attacks, the entire population is better off. That argument provides a rationale for federal financing of the enhanced transportation security measures without additional collections raised directly from the airline in \u0010 dustry or its customers to cover those costs.450 Community and Regional Development Budget function 450 includes programs th at support the deve lopment of physical and fina ncial infrastructure intended to promote viable community economies.

Funds are gen \u0010 erally allocated among the states on the basis of their rural populations and the number of rural families with in \u0010 come below the poverty level. Within each state's allo \u0010 cation, the department awards funds on a competitive basis to eligible applicants, including state and local agen \u0010 cies, nonprofit organizations, and (in the case of loan guarantees for business and industry) for \u0010profit firms. The terms of a particular recipient's assistance depend on the purpose of the aid and, in some cases, the economic condition of the recipient's geographic area. For example, aid for water and waste \u0010disposal projects can take the form of loans with interest rates ranging fr om 4.5 percent to market rates, depending on the area's median house \u0010 hold income; areas that are particularly needy may receive grants or a mix of grants and loans. For 2002, the Congress approp riated roughly $800 mil \u0010 lion for RCAP's grants and the budgetary cost of its loans and loan guarantees, which is defined under credit reform as the present value of the interest rate subsidies and ex \u0010 pected defaults. The Congress could reduce future spend \u0010 ing by capitalizing state revolving loan funds for rural development and then ending federal assistance under RCAP. The amount of federal savings would depend on the level and timing of the contribution to capitalize therevolving funds. Under one illustrative option, the federal government would provide steady funding of $807 mil \u0010 lion annually for five more years to capitalize the funds, then cut off assist ance in 2009. That option would yield savings of $2.7 billion from 2004 to 2013. That level of capitalization alone would not support the volume of loans and grants that RCAP now provides. Accordingly, the Congress could allow the revolving funds to use their capital as collateral with which to leverage new funds from the private sector\u2014as the state revolving loan funds established under the Clean Water and Safe Drinking Water Acts have b een allowed to do. Supporters of this option contend that the federal govern \u0010 ment should not bear continuing responsibility for local development; rather, programs that benefit localities, whether urban or rural, should be funded at the state or local level. They argue that a few more years of federal funding to capitalize the revolving funds will provide a reasonable transition to the desired policy. Opponents of converting RCAP argue that states might shift their aid from grants to loans and from low \u0010interest to high\u0010interest loans to avoid depleting the revolving funds, which could price the aid out of the reach of needier communities. In addition, precedent suggests that the estimated federal savings might not materialize: the Congress continues to appropriate additional grants to the state funds for wastewater treatment systems, long past the expiration of the original authorization for those grants.

The ARC, established in 1965, conducts ac tivities that promote economic growth in the Appalachian counties of 13 states. Modeled after the ARC, the Denali Commission, created in 1998, covers remote areas in Alaska. Similarly, the DRA, estab \u0010 lished in 2000, covers 240 counti es and parishes near the Mississippi River in eight states stretching from southernIllinois to the Louisiana coast. For 2003, the Congress appropriated $71 million fo r the ARC, $38 million for the Denali Commission, an d $10 million for the DRA. Discontinuing federal funding for all three programswould save $21 million in 2004 and $386 million over five years. The three agencies provide programs designed to, among other things, create jobs, improve rural education and health care, develop utility and other infrastructure, and provide job training. Few studies address the effectiveness of such programs. A 1996 re port by the General Ac \u0010 counting Office reviewed the available evidence andfound one study showing that ARC \u0010aided counties grew significantly faster, along various socioeconomic mea \u0010sures, than otherwise similar non \u0010ARC counties. How \u0010 ever, a strong link could not be made between the activi \u0010 ties of the ARC and the counties' growth. Supporters of this option focus on two main points. First, they contend that the responsibility for supporting local or regional development basically lies with the state and local governments whose citizens will benefit from the development, not with the federal government. Second, they note that all regions of the country have needy areas; thus, they argue that the Appalachian areas, rural Alaska, and the Mississippi Delta have no special claim to federal dollars and should get any federal development aid through national programs, such as those of the Eco \u0010 nomic Development Administration. Opponents of this option believe that the federal govern \u0010 ment has a legitimate role to play in redistributing funds among states to support development in the neediest areas and that cutting federa l funding would reduce local progress in education, health care, and job creation. Theyfurther contend that the size , physical isolation, and se \u0010 vere poverty of Appalachia and the other regions coveredrequire special attention.

The program also allocates funds to states, which in turn distribute them among smaller and more rural communities, called nonentitlement areas, typically through a competitive process. In general, CDBG funds must be used to aid low \u0010 and moderate\u0010income households, eliminate slums and blight, or meet emergency needs. Specific eligible uses include housing rehabilitation, infrastructure improvement, and economic development. Funds from the entitlement component may also be used to repay bonds that are is \u0010 sued by local governments (to acquire public property, for example) and guaranteed by the federal government under the Section 108 pr ogram. For 2003, the CDBG program received an appropriation of $4.4 billion, in \u0010 cluding $3.0 billion for en titlement co mmunities. Under current law, all urban counties, central cities of metropolitan areas, and cities with a population of 50,000 or more are eligible for the CDBG entitlement program. The program alloca tes funds according to a formula that includes the following factors: population, the number of residents with income below the poverty level, the number of housing units with more than one person per room, the number of housing units built be \u0010 fore 1940, and the extent to which an area's population growth since 1960 is less than the average for all metro \u0010 politan cities. The formula neither requires a threshold percentage of residents living in poverty nor excludes communities with high aver age income. An analysis inthe President's budget for 2004 shows that under the cur \u0010 rent formula, popu lation and other data from the 2000 census will shift funding from poorer to wealthier com \u0010 munities, as meas ured by average poverty rates. Federal spending for the program could be reduced by focusing entitlement grants on needier jurisdictions and lowering funding accordingly. Several alternative changes to the current formula could yield similar results; one simple approach, however, would be to exclude com \u0010 munities whose per capita income exceeds the national average by more than a certain percentage. Data suggest that restricting the grants to communities whose per capita income is less than 112 percent of the national average, for example, would save 26 percent of the en \u0010 titlement funds, in part by cutting the large grants to New York City and Los Angeles. To illustrate the general approach, this option assu mes a somewhat smaller cut of 20 percent of entitlement funding, which would save an estimated $12 million in 2004 and $1.9 billion over five years. Proponents of this option might argue that if the CDBG program can be justified at all (some people contend that using federal funds for local development is generally inappropriate), its primary rationale is redistribution and that redirecting money to wealthier communities serves no pressing interest. Opponents might argue that such a change would reduce efforts to aid low \u0010 and moderate \u0010 income households in pockets of poverty within those communities, because local governments would not suf \u0010 ficiently reallocate their own funds to offset the lost grants.

The NRC oversees a net \u0010 work of locally initiated and operated groups called NeighborWorks organizations, or NWOs, which engage in a variety of housing, neighborhood revitalization, and community \u0010building activities. The corporation provides technical and financial assistance to begin new NWOs; it also monitors and assists current network members. As of September 2002, the Neig hborWorks network had 223 members operating in 2,339 communities nation \u0010 wide. For 2002, the NRC's appropriation was $105 million. With its appropriated funds, plus a few million dollars from fees and other sources, the corporation provides grants, conducts training pr ograms and educational for \u0010 ums, and produces publications in support of NWOs. The bulk of the grant money goes to NWOs, which use the funds to purchase, construct, and rehabilitate pro \u0010 perties; capitalize their revolving loan funds; develop new programs; and cover their operating costs. NWOs' re \u0010 volving loan funds make home ownership and home improvement loans to individuals or loans to owners of mixed\u0010use properties who provide long \u0010term rental hous \u0010 ing for low \u0010 and moderate \u0010income households. In addi \u0010 tion, the NRC awards grants to Neighborhood Housing Services of America to provide a secondary market for the loans from NWOs. Eliminating the NRC would save $107 million in 2004 and $557 mi llion over five years.Supporters of this option assert that the federal govern \u0010 ment should not fund programs whose benefits are local rather than national. In addition, they argue that the NeighborWorks approach duplicates the efforts of pro \u0010 grams of other federal agencies (particularly the Depart \u0010 ment of Housing and Urban Development, or HUD) that also rehabilitate low \u0010income housing and promote home ownership and community development. More \u0010 over, they note that even within the NeighborWorks ap \u0010 proach, the NRC is a redundant funding channel. In 2001, NRC grants accounted fo r about 17 percent of the NWOs' government funding and roughly 3.4 percent of their total funding. Larger shares came from private lenders, foundations, corporations, and HUD. Opponents of this option argue that the large number of federal programs to assist local development is evidence of widespread support for a federal role\u2014particularly in areas where state and local governments may lack ade \u0010 quate resources of their own. They further argue that NWOs concentrate on whole neighborhoods rather than individual housing properties and, with their nonhousing activities (such as community organization building, neighborhood cleanup and beautification, and leadership development), provide economic and social benefits that other federal programs do not. Finally, people who op \u0010 pose this option say that the NRC is valuable because of its flexibility in making grants, which allows it to fund worthwhile efforts that do not fit within the narrow cri \u0010 teria of larger federal grantors, and because of the valuable services it provides to the NWOs, such as training, pro \u0010 gram evaluation, and technical assistance. RELATED OPTION :4 5 0\u001007110 BUDGET OPTIONS 450-05\u2014Mandatory Drop Flood Insurance for Certain Repeatedly Flooded Properties Total (Millions of dollars) 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2004-2008 2004-2013 Savings Budget authority 0 0 0 0 0 0 0Outlays 90 194 209 225 242 960 2,481 Data from the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) show that a relatively small number of properties subject to repeated flooding account for a large share of the losses incurred by the program. The Federal Emer \u0010 gency Management Agency (FEMA), which administers the NFIP, has focused its attention on properties for which there have been two or more losses of at least $1,000 each in any 10 \u0010year period since 1978 (the earliest year for which data are available). The roughly 95,000 properties fitting that definition account for about one \u0010 third of all claims, by both number and dollar value, since 1978. Many of those pr operties no long er have flood in \u0010 surance: in some cases, the property has been destroyed or relocated; in other cases, the owner dropped the policy \u2014for example, after FEMA , in 1983, limited coverage under the NFIP for basement losses. The NFIP currently insures roughly 45,000 repeated ly flooded properties, representing about 1 percent of all policies in force but accounting for a much larger share of annual flood losses. The issue of repeatedly flooded properties raises concern in part because they generally are covered at premiums that are well below the actuarial risk of flood losses. FEMA's data show that 95 percent of such properties were built before the development of the flood insurance rate map (FIRM) for their community\u2014which is not sur \u0010 prising, given the flood mitigation requirements imposed on post\u0010FIRM construction. Thus, almost all repeatedly flooded properties are covered under the pre \u0010FIRM pre \u0010 miums that the government explicitly subsidizes. (See the related discussion in option 450 \u001006.) Some propertiesmay incur losses twice in 10 years because of a bad \"draw\" of storms or other random events\u2014but others have flooded four, five, or even 10 or 20 times since 1978. One way to reduce federal costs for the flood insurance program would be to deny coverage after the third loss of at least $1,000 in any 10 \u0010year period. According to FEMA's data, that option would immediately affect more than 27,000 properti es; by the Congressional Budget Office's estimates, it would reduce federal outlays by $90 million in 2004 and $960 million over the 2004 \u0010 2008 period. Supporters of this option argue that neither taxpayers nor other policyholders should be required to provide an unlimited subsidy for properties known to be at high risk for frequent flood damage. The loss or threat of losing the NFIP's protection could encourage owners of such properties to take appropriate mitigation mea \u0010 sures, such as elevating their structures or rebuilding elsewhere. Opponents of this option argue that it would be unfair to the owners to suddenly withdraw their protection from flood risk\u2014especially owners who have occupied their properties since before the local FIRM was developed and who cannot readily afford relocation or other costly miti \u0010 gation measures. Some opponents might prefer a more moderate change from the current policy, such as adding a repetitive \u0010loss surcharge to insurance premiums or denying coverage only to policyholders who reject offers of mitigation assistance.

Post \u0010FIRM premiums are intended to be actuarially sound\u2014that is, to cover the costs of all insured losses over the long term\u2014and are based on buildings' elevations relative to the water level ex \u0010 pected during a \"100 \u0010year flood\" (the most severe flood thought to have a local probability of at least 1 in 100 each year). In contrast, pre \u0010FIRM rates are heavily subsidized, on average, and do not take elevation into account. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), which administers the flood insurance program, estimates that about 19 percent of all coverage is provided at pre \u0010FIRM rates. Those rates are available only for the first $35,000 of coverage for a single\u0010family or a two \u0010 to four\u0010family dwelling and for the first $100,000 of coverage for a larger residential, nonresidential, or small\u0010business building. Various levels of additional coverage are available at actuarially sound rates. The program also offers insurance for buildings' contents; again, policyholders in pre \u0010 FIRM buildings pay lower rates for a first tier of coverage. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that, on average, the first\u0010tier prices represent 38 percent of the actuarial value, im \u0010 plying a subsidy rate of 62 percent. The size of the subsidy for any particular building depends heavily on its elevation. Phasing out the subsidy on all insured structures other than primary residences\u2014second and vacation homes, rental proper \u0010 ties, and nonresidential stru ctures\u2014would yield additional receipts of $25 million in 2004 and $588 million over the 2004\u00102008 period. Those estimates take into account the likelihood that some current policyholders will drop their cover \u0010age. Flood insurance is mandatory only for properties in special flood hazard areas that carry mortgages from federally insured lenders, and compliance with th e requirement is far from com \u0010 plete. Accordingly, CBO expects that the option would some \u0010 what reduce the participation of both voluntary purchasers and property owners for whom the insurance is mandatory. Advocates of this option argue that the subsidy has outlived its original justification as a temporary measure to encourage participation among property owners who were not previously aware of the magnitude of the flood risks they faced. Phasing out the subsidies, such advocates maintain, would make policy \u0010 holders pay more of their fair share for insurance protection and would give them incentives to relocate or take preventive mea \u0010 sures. And while some proponen ts would prefer to phase out the subsidies on primary residences as well, advocates of this particular option argue that it focuses on structures whose owners would face relatively little hardship in paying actuarial rates. Some opponents of this option primarily object to its inclusion of rental properties, because owners may pass on the increased costs to renters. Others support the subsidy more generally, on the grounds that it would be unfair to charge full actuarial rates to owners of properties built before FEMA documented the extent of local flood hazards. Subsidy supporters would also argue that reduced rates of participation in the program would lead to increased spending on disaster grants and loans and thereby erode some of the projec ted savings. Finally, they ques \u0010 tion the accuracy of the maps FEMA uses to estimate the aver \u0010 age long\u0010run subsidy, noting that for most pre \u0010FIRM properties (except a relatively few structures that repeatedly flood), premi \u0010 ums now roughly equal the average losses incurred to date.

The fund provides equity investments, grants, loans, and technical assistance to CDFIs, which include community development banks, credit unions, loan funds, venture capital funds, and microenterprise funds. In turn, the CDFIs provide a range of financial services\u2014such as mortgage financing for first\u0010time home buyers, loans and investments for new or expanding small businesses, and credit counseling\u2014in markets that are underserved by traditional institutions. The CDFI fund also provides incentive grants to tradi \u0010 tional banks and thrifts to invest in CDFIs and to in \u0010 crease loans and services to distressed communities. In addition, the fund administers the New Markets Tax Credit (NMTC) program be gun in 2002 to provide fed \u0010 eral tax credits for qualified investments in \"community development entities.\" For 2002, the Congress appropri ated $79 million for the CDFI fund. Eliminating the fund would save $5 million in 2004 and $274 million over fi ve years. The estimated savings take into account the small amount of spending that would still be required by other agencies for over \u0010 sight of the fund's existing loan portfolio and administra \u0010 tion of the NMTC program.Supporters of this option argue, first, that local develop \u0010 ment should be funded at the state or local level, not by the federal government, since its benefits are not national in scope. Second, they see the CDFI fund as redundant, given that many other fede ral programs and agencies support home ownership and local economic develop \u0010 ment, including the Empowerment Zones/Enterprise Communities Program, housing loan programs of the Rural Housing Service, the Community Development Block Grant program, the Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation, and the Economic Development Adminis \u0010 tration. Appropriations for those programs and agencies totaled $6.2 billion in 2002. Third, some proponents argue that assistance to CDFIs is likely to be inefficient, encouraging them to make loans that would not pass market tests for creditworthiness. Opponents of this option contend that the federal gov \u0010 ernment has a legitimate role in assisting needy com \u0010 munities, some of which lack access to traditional credit sources. By assisting existing CDFIs and stimulating the creation of others, the fund provides an efficient mecha \u0010 nism, they argue, for leveraging private \u0010sector investment with a relatively small federal contribution.

(The law also authorized designation of 95 \"enterprise communities\" that are eligible for gr ants of $3 million each.) Since 1993, the Congress has au thorized two additional rounds of empowerment zones, increasingly emphasizing tax credits rather than gran ts.

Most of the program's funds are used to make basic support payments to districts for so \u0010 called federally connected students (such as those living on Indian land or military bases). Impact Aid funds are also used to maintain schools owned by the Department of Education and to help pay for school construction in areas where the federal government has acquired a signifi \u0010 cant portion of the real property tax base, thus depriving the school district of a source of revenue. In 2003, approximately 1,300 lo cal education agencies will receive basic support payments from the Impact Aid program. For a school district to be eligible for those payments, a minimum of 3 percent\u2014or at least 400\u2014of its students must be associated with activities of the fed \u0010 eral government. The amount of a school district's basic support payments is based on a grant formula that con \u0010 siders the district's population of \"Type A\" and \"Type B\" students. Type A students include those living on Indian land as well as students living on federal land whose par \u0010 ents are either employed on federal land, are members of the armed forces, or are employees of a foreign govern \u0010 ment (such as embassy per sonnel). Type B students in \u0010clude children whose parents are in the military services but who live on private property as well as children who reside in federally subsidized low \u0010rent housing. In addi \u0010 tion, aid goes to a few districts in which 10 percent\u2014or at least 1,000\u2014of the students have pare nts who work but do not live on federal property. Those children are also classified as Type B students. This option would focus Impact Aid on the school dis \u0010 tricts that are most affected by federal activities by elimi \u0010 nating support for Type B students. Instead, a school dis \u0010 trict's basic support payments would be based solely on its enrollment of Type A students. That change would reduce fe deral outlays by $119 million in 2004 and by $646 million over the 2004 \u00102008 period. Proponents of this option argue that it is appropriate to restrict Impact Aid payments to cover only those students whose presence puts the greatest burden on school dis \u0010 tricts. Opponents argue that eliminating payments for other types of children associated with federal activities could significantly affect ce rtain districts\u2014for example, those in which large numbers of military families live off \u0010 base but shop at military exchanges, which do not collect state and local sales taxes.

States get SDFSCA funding on the basis of their school \u0010age population and number of poor children. In 2002, that fu nding totaled $472 million. States distribute SDFSCA funds to school districts in the form of grants that can be used at the discretion of local administrators. Some 97 percent of the nation's school districts receive those grants. The SDFSCA program stipulates that the money go toward activities that address violence and drug abuse in schools, but it offers little guidance about what constitutes an effective use of those funds. Moreover, little evidence exists about what activi \u0010 ties reduce violence and drug abuse among young people. This option would eliminate payments to states under the SDFSCA. That change woul d save $246 million in out \u0010 lays next year and a total of about $2.2 billion over the 2004\u00102008 period.Advocates of this option might argue that the activities supported by the SDFSCA do not appear to be effective. A 2001 RAND report concluded that those activities have shown little success in reducing the incidence of violence and drug abuse in schools. Furthermore, although vio \u0010 lence and drug abuse in general are pressing societal issues, they are problems that rarely occur on school grounds. Despite the occasional well \u0010publicized incident, studies show that schools are among the safest places in the country, on average, and that drug use occurs infre \u0010 quently on school property. In addition, rates of violent injury on school grounds have not changed significantly since the SDFSCA was enacted in 1986. Critics of this option would argue that prevention efforts such as those funded by the SDFSCA may serve a pro \u0010 active function by raising people's awareness of the prob \u0010 lems of drug abuse and violence. If such activities were eliminated, drug use and violence might accelerate and lead to even more costly interventions on the part of school systems and communities.118 BUDGET OPTIONS 500-03\u2014Mandatory Eliminate Interest Subsidies on Loans to Graduate Students Total (Millions of dollars) 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2004-2008 2004-2013 Outlay Savings 625 950 985 1,010 1,030 4,600 10,005 Federal student loan programs give students and their parents the opportunity to borrow funds to pay for post \u0010 secondary education. Those programs offer \"subsidized\" loans to students who are defined as having financial need and \"unsubsidized\" loans to students regardless of need. Two programs provide both types of loans: the Federal Family Education Loan Program, in which loans made by private lenders are guaranteed by the federal govern \u0010 ment; and the William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan Program, in which the government makes loans through schools. Borrowers of federal student loans benefit because the interest rates that they are charged are lower than the rates that most of them could secure from alter \u0010 native sources. Borrowers of subsidized loans benefit fur \u0010 ther because the federal government forgives interest on those loans while students are in school and for six months afterward. This option would reduce federal costs by restricting eligibility for subsidized loans only to undergraduate stu \u0010 dents. Doing so would lower federal outlays by $625 mil \u0010 lion in 2004 and by $4.6 billion over the 2004 \u00102008 period. Restricting subsidized loans only to undergraduate stu \u0010 dents would direct a larger share of student aid fundingto those students than is now the case. Supporters of that shift would argue that the federal government's primary role in higher education is to make such education avail \u0010 able to all high school graduates. In their view, graduate students have already achiev ed the success not available to many high school graduates. Opponents of such a shift in funding would argue that supporting graduate students is an equally important role of the federal government be \u0010 cause those students are the ones most likely to make sci \u0010 entific, technological, and other advances that will benefit society as a whole. Under this option, graduate students who lost access to subsidized loans could take out unsubsidized federal loans of the same amount and still benefit from below \u0010market interest rates. Nevertheless, graduate students often amass large student loan debts because of the number of years of schooling required for their degrees. Without the benefit of interest forgiveness while they were enrolled in school, their debt would be substantially larger when they entered the repayment period, because the interest on the amounts they had borrowed over the years would be added to their loan balance. However, the federal student loan programs have several options for making repayment manageable for students who have high loan balances or difficult financial circumstances.

Ford Federal Direct Loan Pro \u0010 gram, students have the opportunity to borrow money for postsecondary education\u2014from lenders and from the government, respec tively\u2014at below \u0010market interest rates. The rate that students are charged on loans from those programs during the repayment period equals the interest rate that the gove rnment pays on 91 \u0010day Treasury bills plus 2.3 percentage points (w ith the total rate not to ex \u0010 ceed 8.25 percent). For the 2002 \u00102003 school year, that rate totals 4.06 percent. Beginning in July 2006, students' interest rate will be fixed at 6.8 percent. Lenders that participate in the FFEL program usually re \u0010 ceive a higher interest rate on federal loans than students pay, with the federal government making up the differ \u0010 ence. Their rate equals either the student rate or the inter \u0010 est rate on commercial paper issued by financial institu \u0010 tions plus 2.34 percentage points, whichever is higher. Even if their rate is lower than market interest rates, lend \u0010 ers are willing to make Federal Family Education loans because the government guarantees repayment of those loans.This option would raise students' interest rate on federal loans from both programs by calculating that rate using the formula for lenders in the FFEL program. That change would boost students' interest rate by an average of about 0.15 percentage poin ts before the planned in \u0010 crease in July 2006 and by 0.5 percentage points after \u0010 ward. Their rate would sti ll be capped at 8.25 percent, however, and the government would continue to make an additional payment to lenders when the lender \u0010rate formula exceeded that cap. This option would reduce federal outlays by $240 million in 2004 and by a total of almost $2.7 billion over five years. For most students, the higher interest rate would still be lower than the rates availabl e on loans from alternative sources. Furthermore, federally guaranteed student loans have attractive repayment options and cost \u0010reducing in \u0010 centives not available elsewhere. However, even a small increase in that interest rate would raise the already high costs that many student face for postsecondary education. Thus, it could discourage some students from continuing their education.

Ford Federal Direct Loan Program, the gov \u0010 ernment recoups part of its costs by collecting up \u0010front fees on each loan to students or their parents. Those fees \u2014which are generally 3 percen t of the face value of the loan\u2014are charged on subsidized and unsubsidized loans to dependent and independent students as well as on PLUS loans to parents. This option would raise those fees to 4 percent for unsub \u0010 sidized loans to dependent students and PLUS loans in both programs. That increase would save the programs a total of $75 million in 2004 and $250 million over the 2004\u00102008 period.Supporters of this option argue that even with higher fees, many families would still benefit substantially from fed \u0010 eral student loans. Moreover, because the option would affect only unsubsidized loans to dependent students and PLUS loans to parents, it would produce savings without affecting the value of loans to independent students (who generally have fewer financial resources than dependent students do) or the value of subsidized loans to the needi \u0010 est dependent students. Critics of this option counter that raising up \u0010front fees would reduce the net proceeds that students received from any given loan. Thus, it would add to the already high education costs that many students face and could cause some of them to forgo or drop out of postsecondary school.

That change made it easier for many stu \u0010 dents to obtain subsidized student loans. The amount a family is expected to contribute depends on its income and assets. Since 1992, the defi nition of assets has ex \u0010 cluded home equity for all families and has excluded all assets for applicants with annual family income below $50,000. This option would once again include home equity in calculating a family's need for financial aid for post \u0010 secondary education, treating home equity as other assets are treated now. In addition, the income threshold under which all assets are excluded would decline from $50,000 per year to its previous level of $15,000. Th ose changes would mean that fewer students qualified for subsidized loans, and those who did qualify would get smaller loans, on average. Overall, including hom e equity in loan calcu \u0010 lations could redu ce outlays by $60 million 2004 and $435 million during the 2004 \u00102008 period.Under this option, students who lost access to subsidized loans could take out unsubsidized federal loans to finance their families' greater expected contribution. That ap \u0010 proach would cause relatively little difficulty for families' budgets because the interest payments on unsubsidized loans can be postponed while the student is in school. The interest is then simply added to the accumulated loan balance when the student leaves school and begins repay \u0010 ment. Nonetheless, students who shifted from subsidized to un \u0010 subsidized loans (or to larger unsubsidized loans) would leave school with higher loan balances. That addition would make repaying the loans more difficult for some students. And for many families, having to determine the value of their home and other assets would complicate the loan application process. Furthermore, families' larger expected contribution could limit their access to discre \u0010 tionary student aid, including Pell grants.

The interest rate that lenders are supposed to receive is calculated quarterly using another formula. If that rate is greater than the student rate, the federal government pays le nders an additional amount in that quarter. If that rate is less than the student rate, the government does not make any additional payments. In effect, the student rate is a floor below which a lender's return cannot fall. This option would eliminate the floor on the interest rate that lenders receive. If the calculated lender rate exceeded the student rate, the government would pay lenders as it does now. But if the calculated lender rate was less than the student rate, lenders would be required to rebate the excess to the government. That change would reduce fed \u0010 eral outlays for the FFEL program by $340 million next year and by a total of al most $4.5 billion over the 2004 \u0010 2008 period.Supporters of this option would argue that the lender \u0010rate formula is designed to approximate a fair market return to lenders. In that view, lenders now earn an above \u0010 market return during quarters when the calculated lender rate is below the student rate. Moreover, compared with other ways of lowering lenders' returns, this approach might be preferable to many lenders because it would closely tie their interest income with their interest ex \u0010 penses. Some opponents of this change contend that the current lender\u0010rate formula underestimates a fair market return. To compensate for that underestimate, lenders rely on occasionally earning more than the calculated rate, as they do when the student \u0010rate floor is in effect. Moreover, the lender\u0010rate formula has been adjusted downward several times in the past decade. Further reductions might induce some lenders to leave the FFEL program.

Ford Federal Direct Loan Program, and the Federal Perkins Loan Program. The Perkins Loan program is the smallest, with allo \u0010 cations made dire ctly to nearly 1,900 postsecondary schools. Financial aid administrators at those schools determine which eligible students receive Perkins loans. During the 2001 \u00102002 academic year, approximately 710,000 students receiv ed such loans. Funding for Perkins loans\u2014which totaled about $1.4 bil \u0010 lion in 2002\u2014comes from an institutiona l revolving fund that has four sources: payments on previous years' student loans, which sch ools collect ( $1.1 billion in 2002); federal payments for loan cancella tions, which are granted when students agree to teach in high \u0010need areas or undertake military or public service ($68 million in 2002); federal co ntributions from new appropriations ($100 million in 2002); and matching contributions from schools, which must equal at least one \u0010third of a school's federal contribution. This option would eliminate new appropriations for fed \u0010 eral contributions to the Perkins Loan program, thus low \u0010 ering outlays by a total of $427 million during the 2004 \u0010 2008 period. The extent to which funding for student loans declined would depend on the responses of post \u0010 secondary institutions, some of which might make up part or all of the lost federal money. If schools did notmake up any of the lost federal funds but continued to contribute to the program at the level of their previous matching contributions, approximately 60,000 fewer Perkins loans would be made annually. Supporters of this option would argue that enough low \u0010 interest loans are available through the Federal Family Education Loan and direct loan programs to render addi \u0010 tional federal capital contributions to the Perkins Loan program unnecessary. Furthe rmore, although the main goal of federal student aid is to eliminate financial barriers to postsecondary education, the Perkins Loan program may be failing to provide equal access to students with equal financial need. Federal contributions are allocated first on the basis of an in stitution's 1999 a llocation and then on the basis of the financial need of its students. Because campus \u0010based aid such as the Perkins Loan pro \u0010 gram is tied to specific institutions, students with greater need at poorly funded schools may receive less money than students with less need at well \u0010funded institutions. Opponents of this option would contend that eliminating new funds for Perkins loans would reduce the total amount of aid available and give schools less discretion in packaging aid to address the special situations of some students. Moreover, nearly half of Perkins loan money goes to students at private nonprofit institutions (com \u0010 pared with about 20 percent of Pell grant aid). Thus, cutting Perkins loans would make that type of school less accessible to financially needy students.

One type of program, campus \u0010based aid, includes the Federal Supplemental Educational Op \u0010 portunity Grant Program, the Federal Perkins Loan Pro \u0010 gram, and the Federal Work \u0010Study Program. The gov \u0010 ernment distributes funds for those programs to institutions, which in turn award grants, loans, and jobs to qualified students. Under a statutory formula, institu \u0010 tions are allowed to use up to 5 percent of those program funds for administrative costs. In another program, the Federal Pell Grant Program, schools also distribute fed \u0010 eral funds but eligibility is determined by federal law rather than by the institutions. The Higher Education Act provides for a federal payment of $5 per Pell grant to re \u0010 imburse schools for some of their costs in administering that program. The government could save about $167 million in budget authority next year if schools were not allowed to usefederal funds from the campus \u0010based aid programs to pay administrative costs. It could save an other $24 million that year if the $5 payment to schools in the Pell Grant program was eliminated. Together, those changes would save a total of $806 million in outlays over the 2004 \u0010 2008 period. Arguments can be made both for eliminating those ad \u0010 ministrative payments and for retaining them. On the one hand, schools benefit significantly from participating in federal student aid programs even without the pay \u0010 ments because the aid makes attendance at those schools more affordable. In 2003, stud ents at those institutions will receive an estimated $15.5 billion in fu nds under the Pell Grant and campus \u0010based aid programs. On the other hand, institutions do incur costs to administer the pro \u0010 grams. Furthermore, if the federal government did not pay those expenses, schools might simply pass along the costs to students in the form of higher tuition or lower institutional student aid.

States must match federal funds at least dollar for dollar and also meet maintenance \u0010of\u0010effort cri\u0010 teria (minimum funding levels based on funding in pre \u0010 vious years). Unless excluded by state law, all public and private nonprofit postsecondary institutions in a state are eligible to participate in the LEAP program. This option would eliminate the program, reducing fed \u0010 eral outlays by $296 million ov er five year s. The extent to which students' financial assistance declined would de \u0010 pend on the responses of the states, some of which would probably make up at least part of the lost federal funds.Proponents of eliminating the LEAP program argue that it is no longer needed to encourage states to provide more student aid. When the program was first authorized in 1972, only 28 states had stud ent grant programs; now, all 50 states provide such grants. Moreover, states cur \u0010 rently fund the program far in excess of the level to which federal matching funds apply. Opponents of eliminating the LEAP program argue that not all states would increase their student aid appropria \u0010 tions to make up for the lost federal funds, and some might even reduce them. In that case, some of the stu \u0010 dents who received less aid might not be able to enroll in college or might have to attend a less expensive school.126 BUDGET OPTIONS 500-11\u2014Discretionary Eliminate the Senior Community Service Employment Program Total (Millions of dollars) 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2004-2008 2004-2013 Savings Budget authority 450 459 468 478 489 2,344 4,954Outlays 76 433 460 470 480 1,919 4,481 The Senior Community Service Employment Program (SCSEP) funds part \u0010time jobs for people age 55 and older who have low income and poor employment prospects. To participate in the program in 2002, a person had to have annual income of less than $11,075\u2014or 125 per \u0010 cent of the federal poverty line for someone living alone. SCSEP grants are awarded to nonprofit organizations, the Forest Service, and state agencies. Those organizations and agencies pay participants to work in part \u0010time com\u0010 munity service jobs, up to a maximum of 1,300 hours per year. In 2002, nearly 100,000 people t ook part in the SCSEP, working in schools, hospitals, and senior citizen centers and on beautification and conservation projects. Partici \u0010 pants are paid the federal or state minimum wage or the local prevailing wage for similar employment, whichever is higher. They are also offe red annual physical examina \u0010 tions, training, personal and job \u0010related counseling, and assistance to move into unsubsidized jobs when they complete their projects. This option would eliminate the SCSEP, saving $76 mil \u0010 lion in outlays ne xt year and $1.9 bi llion over the 2004 \u0010 2008 period (compared with the 2003 appropriations en \u0010 acted on February 20, 2003, ad justed for inflation).Advocates of this option maintain that the SCSEP offers few benefits aside from income support and that the work experience gained by participants would generally be more valuable if it was provided to equally disadvantaged young people, who have longer careers over which to benefit from it. In addition, the costs of producing the services now provided by SCSEP participants could be borne by the organizations that benefit from their work; under current law, those organizations usually must bear just 10 percent of such costs. Shifting those costs would ensure that only the services that were most highly valued would be provided. Opponents of this option note that the SCSEP is the major federal jobs program aimed at low \u0010income older workers. Eliminating it could cause hardship for workers who were unable to find comparable unsubsidized jobs. In general, older workers are less likely than younger workers to be unemployed, but those who are take longer to find work. Moreover, without the SCSEP, community services might be reduced if nonprofit organizations and states were unwilling or unable to increase their spending to offset the loss of federal funds.550 Health Budget function 550 includes fe deral spending for heal th care services, di sease prevention , consumer and occupational safety, health \u0010related research, and similar activities. The largest component of spending is the federal/state Medicaid program, which funds health services for some low \u0010income women, children, and elderly people as well as people with disabilities. Mandator y outlays for Medicaid in creased by more than 10 percent per year in the early 1990s and have risen significantly again in the past few ye ars.

The federal matching rate is 50 percent for most administra \u0010 tive activities but is higher in certain cases. For example, the federal government pays 75 percent of the costs of skilled medical professionals who are employed in Medic \u0010 aid administration, 75 percent of the costs of utilization review, 90 percent of the costs of developing systems to process claims and manage information, and 75 percent of the costs of operating such systems. This option would set the federal matching rate for all Medicaid administrative costs at 50 percent. That change would save $970 million in 2004 and $7.0 billion over five years. Supporters of this option would argue that enhanced matching rates are designed to encourage states to de \u0010 velop and support particular administrative activities that the federal government considers important for theMedicaid program. Once the administrative systems are operational, however, there may be less reason to con \u0010 tinue to pay higher rates. Moreover, because states pay about 43 percent of the cost of health care for Medicaid beneficiaries, on average, they have clear incentives to maintain efficient information systems and employ skilled professionals. Opponents would counter that without higher matching rates, states might decide to cut back on some activities, with adverse consequences for the quality of care and for program management. For example, states might hire fewer nurses to conduct utilization reviews and oversee care in nursing homes, or they might make fewer im \u0010 provements to their information \u0010management systems. However, if the Congress wanted to support particular administrative functions, it could retain the higher matching rates for those functions while reducing the matching rates for others.

Before the 1996 welfare reform law, the federal government's three major public assistance programs\u2014Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC), Food Stamps, and Medicaid\u2014all reimbursed states for 50 percent of most types of admin \u0010 istrative costs. As a matter of administrative convenience, states usually charged the common administrative costs of those programs to AFDC. The welfare reform law replaced AFDC and some related programs with the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) block \u0010grant program. The block grants that states receive are based on past federal welfare spend \u0010 ing, including reimbursements for administrative costs. Thus, insofar as states had previously paid the common administrative costs of public assistance programs from AFDC funds, those amounts are now included in their block grants. Although the welfare reform law was silent about the cost allocation process, the Department of Health and Human Services requ ires states to charge part of those common administrative costs to Medicaid, even if the costs are already included in the states' TANF block grants. This option would reduce federal reimbursement for the administrative costs of Medicaid to reflect the share of those costs that is assumed to be covered by the TANFblock grant; it would also prohibit states from using TANF funds to pay those costs. (Assuming that states spend all of their TANF block \u0010grant funds in the long run, prohibiting them from using those funds to pay Medicaid administrative costs would increase the savings from this option in the early years, although it would have little effect over a longer period.) The reduction in funding would equal about one \u0010third of the common costs of administering the Medicaid, AFDC, and Food Stamp programs that were charged to AFDC during the base period used for determining the amount of the TANF block grant. (A similar adjustment has already been made in the amount that the federal government pays the states to administer the Food Stamp program.) The primary advantage of this option would be its sav \u0010 ings: federal outlays woul d decline by $280 million in 2004 and by almost $1.8 billion over the 2004 \u00102008 period. If the policy allowed states to use TANF funds to pay those administrative costs, the savings would be smaller in the short run: $150 million in 2004 and $1.7 billion over five years. In the long run, the savings would be about the same as under this option. Critics of this option would argue that reducing federal reimbursements could hamper states' outreach activities to enroll more eligible children in Medicaid and the State Children's Health Insurance Program or could prompt states to reduce eligibility or services. As a result, fewer people might be enrolled in those programs.

An alternative strategy would be to base those payments on matching payments for administrative costs in the period before the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) block \u0010grant program was established. Under this option, the federal government would cap the amount per enrollee that it paid the states for Medicaid administration. That cap would grow by 5 percent a year from the base \u0010year amount, which would be the admin \u0010 istrative costs per enrollee for which the states claimed matching payments in 1996. Savings from that change would total almost $2.2 billion in 2004 and $15.0 billion over the 2004 \u00102008 period.Under this approach, states that had allocated Medicaid's common administrative costs to the Aid to Families with Dependent Children program before TANF's creation would not have those costs included in their projected Medicaid administrative costs. But states that had claimed those common costs through the Medicaid program would have them built into their administrative cost base for Medicaid. Limiting federal payments to a 5 percent growth rate would produce large savings be \u0010 cause the actual growth rate of administrative costs aver \u0010 aged more than 5 percen t a year during the 1996 \u00102002 period and is projected to exceed 5 percent in 2003 and later years.

The program is financed jointly by the states and the federal government, with the government match \u0010 ing state spending at a rate of 50 percent to 83 percent depending on the state's per capita income. (The match \u0010 ing rate averages 57 percent nationwide.) Although the federal match helps states provide health coverage to dis \u0010 advantaged populations, it may also encourage over \u0010 spending by subsidizing each additional Medicaid dollar spent. In 2002, the federal sh are of Medicaid outlays amounted to $80.2 billion fo r acute care and $43.1 bil \u0010 lion for long \u0010 term care. This option would convert the federal share of Medicaid payments for acute care services into a block grant, as 1996 legislation did with welfare programs. (Long \u0010term care would continue to be financed as it is now.) Eachstate's block grant would eq ual its 2003 fede ral Medicaid payment for acute care, indexed to the increase in themedical consumer price index for urban consumers. That change in financing would re duce federal outlays by $3.2 billion in 2004 and by $64.0 billion over the 2004 \u00102008 period because federal Medicaid payments are projected to grow faster than that price index under current law. (Alternatively, block grants could be indexed to changes in a state's Medicaid caseload. In that case, savings wouldbe the same in 2004 but woul d grow at a slower rate thereafter, tota ling $55.6 billion over five years.) In ex \u0010 change for slower growth in payments, states would be given more flexibility in how they could use the funds to meet the needs of their low \u0010income and uninsured populations. The Administration has proposed a Medicaid block \u0010grant plan in its 2004 budg et request. Its proposal would givestates the option of operating under current Medicaid rules or choosing separate block grants for acute care and long\u0010term care. Those grants would include funds for both Medicaid and the State Children's Health InsuranceProgram and would allow significantly more flexibility in program administration. Supporters argue that subsidizing acute care with a block grant rather than a federal matching rate would give states more incentive to spend money cost \u0010effectively by re \u0010 quiring them to face the full cost of each additional dollarof health spending. Block grants would also give states more discretion in designing and administering their own programs. For example, some states might choose to offer a less generous benefit package in order to extend cov \u0010 erage to more people. In addition, block grants wouldend states' incentives to employ funding strategies that are designed mainly to maximize federal assistance. Opponents counter that converting acute care payments to a block grant would have various drawbacks. First, the block\u0010grant option as described here would reduce the total amount of federal support for Medicaid, whichcould increase fiscal pressures on states. Second, removing the matching rate could provide an incentive for states to scale back their Medicaid coverage. Unless states were willing to do more themselves or could find ways to pro \u0010 vide care more cost \u0010effectively, some people who would benefit under current law might receive less coverage or none at all. Third, distinguishing between acute and long\u0010term care for the purposes of financing could be dif \u0010 ficult administratively. For example, hospital patientsoften receive services that resemble long \u0010term care to facilitate their recovery after an inpatient stay. Fourth,having greater state discretion could widen the gaps that now exist between different states' Medicaid benefits and eligibility requirements.132 BUDGET OPTIONS 550-05\u2014Mandatory Convert Medicaid Disproportionate Share Hospital Payments into a Block Grant Total (Millions of dollars) 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2004-2008 2004-2013 Outlay Savings 680 760 850 930 1,000 4,220 10,480 Hospitals that serve a disproportionately large share of low\u0010income patients may receive higher payments from Medicaid than other hospitals do. Under broad federal guidelines, each state determines which hospitals receive so\u0010called disproportionate share hospital (DSH) pay \u0010 ments and the size of those payments. During the late 1980s and early 1990s, many stat es were able to increase the amount of federal Medicaid funding they received relative to the amount they spent on disproportionate share hospitals\u2014in effect raising the federal matching rate above the rate specified in statute for a given state. To accomplish that, states assessed special taxes, accepted donations, or obtained intergovernmental transfers from DSH hospitals; made a DSH payment back to those providers, financed wholly or partly by the tax, donation, or transfer; reported the DSH payment to Medicaid; and subsequently obtained federal matching payments for those funds. During the 1990s, lawmakers en acted a series of restric \u0010 tions on Medicaid DSH payments, culminating in fixed ceilings on states' DSH payments that applied through 2002. After 2002, those ceilings are adjust ed to keep pace with inflation. Consequently, federal outlays for Medic \u0010 aid DSH payments, which totaled $8.7 billion in 2002, are projected to rise to $9.5 billion by 2008 under current law. This option would convert the current Medicaid dispro \u0010 portionate share hospital program into a block grant to the states, as an alternative way to provide federal finan \u0010 cial support for health care institutions that serve a large share of poor and uninsured patients. The grant could be reduced below current \u0010law levels and its future growth limited to a slower rate than the rate at which Medicaid DSH payments would increase under current law. Inexchange for lower funding, states could be given greater flexibility to use the funds to meet the needs of their low \u0010 income and uninsured populations in the most cost \u0010 effective ways. In this illustrative option, the block grant for each state in 2004 would equal the state's Medicaid DSH allotment for 2003 minus 10 percent. In subsequent years, the block grant would be indexed to the increase in the con \u0010 sumer price index for urban consumers minus 1 per \u0010 centage point. Savings from this option would total $680 million next year and $4.2 billion over the 2004 \u00102008 period. Supporters of a block grant would argue that the in \u0010 creased latitude provided to states under this option could result in DSH funds' being targeted more appropriately and equitably to facilities and providers that serve low \u0010 income populations. For example, states would have greater flexibility to use those funds to support outpatient clinics and other nonhospital providers that treat Medic \u0010 aid beneficiaries and low \u0010income patients. Opponents of this option would argue that given the fis \u0010 cal problems facing many states today, state governments might not increase their contributions to make up for the reduction in federal subsidies. As a result, hospitals (and health care providers in general) could receive less in combined federal and state Medicaid subsidies. Addi \u0010 tionally, giving states more flexibility to allocate DSH payments could alter the distribution and amount of as \u0010 sistance among hospitals, possibly causing some large ur \u0010 ban hospitals to receive less public funding than they do now. Moreover, states may already have enough flexibility under current rules to allocate DSH payments to achieve the maximum benefit.

That ceiling, known as the upper payment limit (UPL), applied to ag \u0010 gregate payments for services provided in both private facilities and those operated by local governments. Since Medicaid's payment rates are typically lower than Medi \u0010 care's, most states had room to increase their Medicaid payments without exceeding the UPL. As a result, many states inflated their payment rates for services provided in local government facilities so as to generate additional federal matching funds and then recovered the inflated portion of those payments from the facilities. The addi \u0010 tional federal Medicaid funds could then be used for any purpose. That process effectively increased federal Medic \u0010 aid payments to states without raising the states' Medic \u0010 aid expenditures. To limit states' ability to generate enhanced payments, the Department of Health and Human Services issued regulations in January 2001 th at created se parate UPLs for private facilities and facilities operated by local gov \u0010 ernments. Those regulations (as required by the Benefits Improvement and Protection Act of 2000) take full effectat different times for different states. States that have used the enhanced \u0010funding mechanism the longest are allowed a transition period stretching to September 30, 2008, whereas some other states have a transition period lasting until 2005. (States that had only re cently sought to enhance their funding are already subject to the new rules.) The extended transition period was designed to give states with the longest history of relying on enhanced payments more time to adjust their budgets to the smaller federal payments that result from the new regulations. This option would require all states to be in full compli \u0010 ance with the UPL regula tions beginning in 2004. That requirement would reduce federal outlays by almost $2.8 billion in 2004 and $7.3 bi llion over five years. Supporters of this option argue that eliminating the extended transition period would treat all states the same, which is m ore equitable than allowing some states to con \u0010 tinue, in effect, to obtain a higher federal matching rate than the one specified by statute. Opponents counter that requiring quicker compliance would reduce federal pay \u0010 ments to some states at a time when they are already fac \u0010 ing severe budgetary difficulties.

Those patents can cover a drug's sub \u0010 stance (chemical compound), its use, or its formulation (such as an extended\u0010release dosage), as approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Such patents are listed in an FDA volume titled Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations , commonly known as the Orange Book. A manufacturer wishing to market a generic version of a brand \u0010name drug must either formally challenge a patent listed in the Orange Book or wait until the patent expires before the FDA can approve its application to produce a generic copy. Although the FDA publishes patent information in the Orange Book, it makes no judgments about whether the patent submitted by a brand \u0010name manufacturer actually covers the drug in question. As a result, some of the pat \u0010 ents currently included in the Orange Book may be in \u0010 appropriately listed, in that they do not claim the same use, formulation, or drug substance that the FDA ap \u0010 proved. (A single drug patent can make several claims.) This option would require that for each patent listed in the Orange Book, the brand \u0010name manufacturer would identify those claims that met the FDA's listing criteria and specify whether the claim related to the approved substance, use, or formulation of the drug. The FDA would publish that direct mapping of patent claims, by type of claim, in the Orange Book. Manufacturers of generic drugs could petition the Secretary of Health and Human Services to review specific listings on an ex \u0010 pedited basis. If the Secretary found that a patent or claim did not appear to cover the approved substance, use, or formulation, the Secretary could request that the brand \u0010 name company delist the patent or claim. Under this op \u0010 tion, any manufacturer interested in producing a generic copy would also be able to sue that brand \u0010name company over the appropriateness of the patent listing. Thosechanges would apply to both current and future patent listings. By helping to ensure that the information in the Orange Book was clear and accurate, this option could speed the marketing of generic drugs in some cases. Generic drugs have much lower prices than their brand \u0010name counter \u0010 parts; consequently, the Congressional Budget Office esti \u0010 mates that federal direct spending on drugs by Medicaid, the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program, the De \u0010 partment of Defense, and (to a limited extent) Medicare would decline by an average of 1 percent over 10 years. As a result, fede ral outlays would fall by $590 million over five years and $4.4 billion over 10 years. The FDA has proposed a rule that would require manu \u0010 facturers to submit patent information on a claim \u0010by\u0010 claim basis, as discussed in this option. That proposed rule would be limited to patents not yet listed in the Orange Book. Under this option, some brand \u0010name drugs would be likely to experience competition from multiple generic copies earlier than they would under current law. Not only the federal government but also states and private \u0010 sector purchasers would benefit from the lower average drug prices associated with earlier marketing of generic drugs. However, to the extent that brand \u0010name manufacturers' sales declined under this option, they would have less money available and less incentive to invest in developing new drugs. The effect on that incentive would probably be small, however, because any decline in profits would occur toward the end of a drug's market life and would thus be heavily discounted (in present \u0010value terms) when the decision about investing in research and development was made.

Many top \u0010 selling brand \u0010name drugs are protected by multiple pat \u0010 ents, which can cover the substance, use, or formulation of the drug as approved by the Food and Drug Admin \u0010 istration (FDA). Such patents, together with the brand \u0010 name products that they cover, are published by the FDA (see option 550 \u001007). If a generic manufacturer can suc \u0010 cessfully demonstrate that a patent is invalid or would not be infringed by its generic copy, it can enter the market before the patent on the brand \u0010name drug expires. Some observers believe that the patent \u0010challenge process estab \u0010 lished under the Hatch \u0010Waxman Act has encountered unanticipated delays that have lessened competition by slowing the marketing of generic drugs in some cases. Generic manufacturers apply to the FDA for approval to produce a bioequivalent copy of a brand \u0010name drug by filing an abbreviated new \u0010drug application (ANDA). When doing so, they must inform the FDA and the brand\u0010name manufacturer of any patents that they are challenging. If the brand \u0010name manufacturer does not sue to defend its patent within 45 days of receiving noti \u0010 fication, the FDA can approve the generic company's ANDA as soon as the company has successfully demon \u0010 strated bioequiv alence. If, however, the brand \u0010name man \u0010 ufacturer does sue, the FDA cannot approve the generic company's ANDA for 30 months or until a district court rules in favor of the generic company. That delay is refer \u0010 red to as a 30 \u0010month stay. When the brand \u0010name com \u0010 pany wins such a suit, the FDA cannot approve the ANDA until the challenged patent has expired. Con \u0010 versely, when a generic manufacturer that is the first to file an ANDA with a patent challenge obtains FDA ap \u0010proval and is able to enter the market before the chal \u0010 lenged patent expires, it ma y be eligible for 180 days of marketing exclusivity. (That exclusivity period gives ge \u0010 neric manufacturers an incentive to take on the litigation costs associated with challenging a patent.) One event that can slow down the patent \u0010challenge pro \u0010 cess is to have a new patent issued on a brand \u0010name drug after a generic manufacturer has already filed its ANDA. A report by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) found several recent cases in which a patent was listed after an ANDA had been filed, resulting in a new 30 \u0010month stay. Such patents are latecomers to the patent \u0010challenge pro \u0010 cess and can prolong litigation. Under this option, patents listed for a brand \u0010name drug after an ANDA had already been filed would no longer be entitled to a 30 \u0010month stay. Instead, if a generic appli \u0010 cant challenged the late \u0010listed patent, the brand \u0010name manufacturer would be required to sue within 45 days and obtain a preliminary injunction to place a stay on FDA approval. If no preliminary injunction was granted by the court, the late \u0010listed patent would not hold up the FDA's final approval of the challenger's ANDA. Further, if the brand \u0010name manufacturer did not sue within 45 days of being notified of the challenge to its late \u0010listed patent, it would lose the right to sue the challenger in the future for infringement of the patent. Together, those changes would help bring some generic drugs to market more quickly, thus reducing the average price of certain drugs. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that federal direct spending on drugs by Medic \u0010 aid, the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program, the Department of Defense, and (to a limited extent) Medi \u0010 care would declin e, saving $104 million over the 2004 \u0010136 BUDGET OPTIONS 2008 period. Nongovernmen t purchasers would also benefit from the lower average cost of drugs that experi \u0010 enced earlier competition from generic copies. The FDA has proposed a rule that would allow only one 30\u0010month stay per ANDA. Th at rule, which has not taken effect, is somewhat less comprehensive than this option. Whereas this option would require legislative action, the proposed rule would rely on the FDA's re \u0010 interpretation of the Hatch \u0010Waxman Act. Besides 30 \u0010month stays on late \u0010listed patents, another mechanism that can delay the marketing of a generic drug is an agreement to that effect reached by the brand \u0010name and generic manufacturers before a court ruling. More \u0010over, in that case, subseque nt generic applicants may be unable to obtain FDA approval while the agreement is in effect (because of interactions with the 180 \u0010day marketing exclusivity). Requiring that such agreements be reported to the FTC could help reduce their frequency and facilitate earlier marketing of some generic drugs. However, that requirement would produce relatively small savings in the federal government's drug spending, in part because the FTC has already increased its over \u0010 sight of such agreements. To the extent that sales of brand \u0010name drugs declined under this option, both the incentive to invest in the de \u0010 velopment of new drugs and the profits available for rein \u0010 vestment would be lessened.

Those subsidies primarily take the form of grants and contracts to schools and hospitals. Several programs provide federal grants to medical schools, teaching hospitals, and other training centers to develop, expand, or improve graduate medical education in primary care specialties and related health fields and to encourage heal th professionals to practice in underserved areas. This option would eliminate those grants and subsidies, saving $70 million in outlay s next year and $810 million over the 2004 \u00102008 period.Supporters of this option argue that even without those subsidies, market forces provide strong incentives for people to seek training and jobs in the health professions, so federal subsidies are unnece ssary. Over the past several decades, the number of physicians\u2014one of the health professions targeted by the subsidies\u2014has increased rapidly. In 2000, for example, the United States had 288 physicians in all fields for every 100,000 people, com \u0010 pared with just 142 in 1960. Critics counter that market incentives may not be strong enough by themselves to achieve desired levels of health professionals. For instance, third \u0010party reimbursement rates for primary care may not encourage enough physi \u0010 cians to enter those specialties and may not provide suffi \u0010 cient financial inducements to increase access to care in underserved areas.

It also ensures the safety of certain egg products. The FSIS employs about 10,000 inspectors, one or more of whom must be present at all times when a meat or poultry slaughtering plant is operating. In addition, in \u0010 spectors monitor processing plants daily for adherence to federal standards (for sanitary conditions, ingredient levels, and packaging) and sa mple and test processed meat and poultry products. Recently, the FSIS has also been charged with protecting the nation's meat and poultry products from bioterrorism. The agency gets most of its funding through annual appropriations\u2014which totaled $731 million in 2002\u2014but the meat packing industry pays for FSIS inspectors (through user fees) when its plants are operating on holiday or overtime hours. This option would finance all federal meat and poultry inspection activities (in addition to those that occur on holiday or overtime shifts) through user fees paid by m eatand poultry slaughtering and processing firms. That change would redu ce federal outlay s by $350 million in 2004 and by a total of $3.4 bi llion over five years. Proponents of this option argue that users of government services should pay for those services. Federal inspections benefit both producers and consumers of meat and poul \u0010 try products because they prevent diseased animals from being sold as food. But the meat and poultry industries benefit in other ways as well: for example, they can adver \u0010 tise their products as having been inspected by the De \u0010 partment of Agriculture, which may enhance the quality of those products in the eyes of consumers. Opponents of this option maintain that the current sys \u0010 tem of public financing is appropriate because the public at large benefits from meat and poultry inspections, since the inspections may prevent the transmission of infectious diseases from those animals to other food or water sources. Moreover, if the packing industry was required to pay user fees, consumers would probably face higher prices for meat and poultry products.CHAPTER TWO FUNCTION 550: HEALTH 139 550-11\u2014Discretionary and Mandatory Adopt a Voucher Plan for the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program Total (Millions of dollars) 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2004-2008 2004-2013 Savingsa Discretionaryb400 900 1,300 1,700 2,200 6,500 25,000 Mandatory 300 800 1,200 1,600 2,100 6,000 24,500 a. Estimates do not include any savings realized by the U.S. Postal Service. b. Savings measured from the 2003 funding level adjusted for premium increases and changes in employment. The Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) program provides health insurance coverage for more than 4 million federal employees and annuitants, as well as for their 4.6 million dependents and survivors, at an expected cost to the government of almost $18.5 billion in 2003. The cost \u0010 sharing structure of the FEHB program encourages federal employees to switch from high \u0010cost to lower \u0010cost plans to blunt the effects of rising premiums; cost sharing also inten \u0010 sifies competitive pressures on all participating plans to hold down premiums. The federal go vernment's share of premi \u0010 ums for employees and annuitants (including for family coverage) is 72 percent of the average weighted premium of all plans. (The employer's costs are higher for the U.S. Postal Service under that agency's collective bargaining agreement.) Policyholders are required to pay at least 25 percent of the premium of any particular plan. (Since October 1, 2000, employees' premiums have come out of pretax income, consistent with the practice for workers in the private sector.) This option would reduce fede ral expenditures by offering a flat voucher for health insura nce that would cover the first $2,800 of premiums for individual employees and retirees or $6,300 for family coverage. Those amounts, which are based on the government's average expected contribution for nonpostal employees in 2003, would increase annually at the rate of inflation rather than at the average weighted rate of change for premiums in the FEHB program. Index \u0010 ing premiums to inflation ra ther than to the growth of premiums would produce budgetary savings because the Congressional Budget Office expects FEHB premiums to grow more than twice as fast as inflation under current law.Savings in discretionary spending (from lower payments for current employees and their dependents) would be $400 million in 2004 and a total of $6.5 billion over five years. Savings in mandatory spending (from reduced payments for retirees) would be $300 million in 2004 and $6.0 billion over five years. Supporters of this option cont end that it would strengthen price competition among health plans in the FEHB pro \u0010 gram because nearly all current enrollees would be faced with paying the full amount of premiums above the level of the voucher. In addition, removing the requirement that enrollees pay at least 25 perc ent of their premiums should increase price competition among low \u0010cost plans to attract participants. In the lowest \u0010cost plans, the government voucher would cover almost the entire premium. Opponents of this option point out that participants would pay an ever \u0010increasing share of th eir premiums\u2014possibly more than 40 percent by 2008\u2014if premiums rose as ex \u0010 pected. The added cost to enrollees could exceed $1,300 per worker in 2008 and more in later years. Currently, large private\u0010sector companies' health plans provide better bene \u0010 fits for employees\u2014although not for retirees\u2014which makes it harder for the government to attract high \u0010quality workers. In addition, opponents note that for current federal retirees and long\u0010time workers, this option would cut benefits that have already been earned. Finally, the option could strengthen existing incentives for plans to structure benefits to disproportionately attract people with lower \u0010than\u0010average health care costs. That \"advers e selection\" could destabilize other health care plans.

Estimates do not include any savings realized by the U.S. Postal Service. Federal retirees are generally eligible to continue receiving benefits from the Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) program if they have participated in the program during their last five years of service and are eligible to receive an immediate annuity. About 78 percent of those new retirees elect to receive health benefits. For retirees over age 65, the FEHB program's benefits are coordi \u0010 nated with those of Medicare; the program pays amounts n o t c o v e r e d b y M e d i c a r e ( b u t n o mo r e t h a n w h a t i t would have paid in the absence of Medicare). Participants and the government share the cost of premiums. The government's share for annuitants and employees is 72 percent of the weighted average premium of all partici \u0010 pating plans (up to a cap of 75 percent of the total premi \u0010 um). In 2003, the government expects to pay $6.6 billion in premiums for 1.4 million nonpostal annuitants plus their dependents and survivors. This option would reduce health benefits for retirees with relatively short federal careers, although it would preserve their right to participate in the FEHB program. For new retirees only, the government's share of premiums would be cut by 2 percentage points for every year of service less than 30. For example, for a re tiree with 20 years of ser \u0010 vice, the government's cont ribution would fall from 70 percent to 50 percent of the average premium. (On average, the government pays a lower share of premiums for annuitants than employ ees because annuitants tend to enroll in more expensive plans.) In 2002, about 60 percent of the roughly 87,000 new retirees who con \u0010 tinued in the FEHB program had less than 30 years of service. The average new retiree affected by this optionwould pay 40 percent of the premium rather than 28 per \u0010 cent, an annual increase of $700 in 2004. The estimated savings to the government in mandatory spending would total $80 million in 2004 and $1.4 billion over five years. (Those estimates exclude savings realized by the Postal Service.) Proponents of this option contend that it would make the government's mix of compensation fairer and more effi \u0010 cient by improving the link between length of service and deferred compensation. It would also help bring federal benefits closer to those of private firms. Federal retirees' health benefits are significan tly greater than those offered by most large private firms, which have been aggressively paring and, in some cases (about 20 percent), eliminating retirees' health benefits for new hires in recent years. A survey of medium and large U.S. employers found that just over 40 percent provide medical benefits to retirees. Moreover, of those companies still offering such benefits, most have tightened eligibility rules for new hires (typi \u0010 cally requiring 10 or more years of service), implemented service\u0010related contributions for future retirees, and capped contribution s for new hires, according to a 2001 survey by Watson Wyatt, a benefits consulting firm. Opponents of this option assert that it would mean a substantial cut in promised benefits, the effects of which would be felt most strongly by the roughly 25 percent of new retirees with less than 20 years of service. The option could also encourage some employees with short federal careers to delay retirement, whereas others might accel \u0010 erate retirement plans to avoid the new rules.

The program pays higher rates to hospitals with teaching programs to cover their higher costs of caring for Medicare patients. In 2003, the additional percentage that those hospitals receive averages about 5.5 percent for each increase of 0.1 in a hospital's ratio of full \u0010time resi\u0010 dents to its number of beds. The additional payments to teaching hospitals are de \u0010 signed to compensate them for indirect teaching costs\u2014 such as the greater number of tests and procedures that residents are thought to prescribe\u2014and to cover higher operating costs from factors not otherwise accounted for in setting the PPS rates. Such factors might include a greater number of severely ill patients, an inner \u0010city loca\u0010 tion, and a more costly mix of staffing and facilities, all of which are associated with hospitals that have large teaching programs. The Medicare Payment Advisory Commission has esti \u0010 mated that a 2.7 percent adju stment to Medicare's pay \u0010ments would more closely match the increase in operat \u0010 ing costs associated with teaching. This option would lower the teaching adjustme nt accordingly, saving $2.6 billion in 2004 and $16 billi on over five years. Supporters of this option contend that it would better align payments with the actual costs that teaching institu \u0010 tions incur. Furthermore, proponents maintain, since the training that medical residents receive will significantly increase their future income, and since hospitals benefit from using residents' labor, it is reasonable for some or all of a hospital's indirect training costs to be borne by both residents and the hospit al. (Residents already bear some of those costs in the form of stipends that are lower than the value of their services to a hospital.) Critics of this option argue that a lower teaching adjust \u0010 ment would probably lead to smaller residency programs. In addition, if teaching hospitals now use some of their payments to fund activities such as charity care, this op \u0010 tion could reduce access to medical services for people without health insurance.

Instead, Medicare makes those payments separately on the basis of its share of a hospital's 1984 cost per resident , indexed for increa ses in the level of consumer prices. Medicare's direct GME payments, which about one \u0010fifth of U.S. hospitals receive, totaled $2.4 billion in 2002. Under this option, hospitals' direct GME payments would be based on 120 percen t of the national average salary paid to re sidents in 1987, upda ted annually for changes in the consumer price index for all urban consu \u0010 mers. In effect, th is option would reduce teaching and overhead payments for residents but continue to pay their salaries and fringe benefits. The option would also main \u0010 tain the current \u0010law practice of reducing payments for residents who have gone beyond their initial residency period. The savings from this option would total about $800 million in 2004 and $4.8 billion over the 2004 \u0010 2008 period. Unlike the curre nt system, in which GME payments vary considerably from hospital to hospital, this option would pay every hospital the same amount for the same type of resident. (Although the Congress recently took action to lessen some of the variation among hospi \u0010 tals in payments per resident, considerable differences re \u0010 main.)Advocates of this option argue that an overall reduction in the level of federal subsidies for medical education might be warranted because market incentives appear to be sufficient to encourage a continuing flow of new phy \u0010 sicians. Moreover, since hospitals use resident physicians to care for patients, and since residency training helps young physicians earn higher incomes in the future, both hospitals and residents might reasonably contribute more to those training costs than they do now. Residents would contribute more to those costs if hospitals responded to the change in reimbursement by cutting residents' salaries or fringe benefits. Opponents of this change note that if hospitals lowered residents' salaries or benefits, the costs of longer residen \u0010 cies\u2014in terms of forgone practice income\u2014could exert greater influence on young physicians' decisions about pursuing a specialty. More residents might choose to begin primary care practice rather than specialize further. That outcome could be negative for the individual resi \u0010 dent (although the Council on Graduate Medical Edu \u0010 cation and other groups believe that a relative increase in the number of primary care practitioners would be de \u0010 sirable for society). Finally, decreasing GME reimburse \u0010 ment could force some hospitals to reduce the resources they commit to training, possibly jeopardizing the quality of their medical education programs.

Currently, hospitals with teaching programs receive additional capital \u0010related pay \u0010 ments that are based on \"teaching intensity,\" measured as the ratio of their residents to their average daily num \u0010 ber of inpatients. An increase of 0.1 in that ratio raises a hospital's capital \u0010related payment by 2.9 percent. This option would eliminate those extra capital \u0010related payments to teaching hospitals. Doing so would save the Medicare program about $200 million next year and $1.0 billion over the 2004 \u00102008 period. Proponents of this option argue that paying teaching hos \u0010 pitals more than nonteaching hospitals for otherwise similar patients may discourage efficient decisionmaking by hospitals. In addition, Medicare's payment adjust \u0010ments for teaching intensity may distort the market for residency training by artificially increasing the value (or decreasing the cost) of residents to hospitals. If residents' training raises the costs of patient care for a hospital, sup \u0010 porters of this option argue, the hospital should bear those costs in order to encourage an efficient amount of training. Hospitals are likely to shift such costs to resi \u0010 dents in the form of lower stipends or greater workloads. Residents will engage in such training if they perceive that their future productivity, as reflected in their future in \u0010 come, will be great enough to outweigh those costs. Critics charge that eliminating the special capital \u0010related payments would reduce revenu es to teaching hospitals at a time when they already face pressure to cut costs in order to remain competitive. Teaching hospitals would probably have to reduce some services as a result, which could mean conducting less medical research or providing fewer services to people without health insurance.

Teaching hos \u0010 pitals now receive GME payments for participants in Medicare+Choice health plans in addition to their tradi \u0010 tional payments for fee \u0010for\u0010service Medicare patients. Several variables determine the total amount of GME payments to a hospital, including the number and diag \u0010 noses of Medicare patients discharged and numerical fac \u0010 tors used annually to update payments for inpatient op \u0010 erating costs and capital \u0010related costs. Because of changes in those variables over time, the Congressional Budget Office expects GME payments to grow at an average rate of 6 percent a year betw een 2004 and 2013 under current law. This option would replace the current payments with a consolidated block grant to fund the special activities of teaching hospitals. Under the present system, a hospital receives GME payments on the basis of formulas set forthin regulations, and Medicare's total GME spending is the resulting sum of what it owes each hospital. This option assumes that the switch to a block \u0010grant program would occur in 2004 and that the am ount of the grant would be based on spending in 2002, with incr eases for the overall rate of inflation. Compared with projected spend \u0010 ing under current law, this option would reduce federal outlays by $400 million in 2004 and by $4.8 billion over the 2004\u00102008 period. Advocates of establishing a block grant for the three types of GME payments argue that it would allow lawmakers to better monitor and adjust GME funding. In addition, Medicare would no longer pay different rates to hospitals for inpatient services merely because of differences in the size or presence of residency programs. Opponents argue that because this option would reduce total payments to teaching hospitals below the amounts expected under current law, such hospitals would, on average, receive less revenue than they would otherwise. In response, teaching hospitals might reduce the amount or quality of some of their services, including medical re \u0010 search and care for people without health insurance.

The Medicare disproportionate share hospital (DSH) adjustment was introduced in 1986 to accoun t for what we re assumed to be the higher costs of treating Medicare patients in such hospitals. Recently, however, the DSH adjustment has been seen mainly as a means to protect access to care for low\u0010income populations by providing financial support to hospitals that serve a large number of low \u0010income patients. Annual outlays for Medicare DSH payments rose rapidly between 1989 and 1997, reaching $4.5 bil \u0010 lion. Restrictions established by the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 caused those outlays to decline for a few years, but they resumed growing in 2000. Last ye ar, Medicare DSH payments totaled $5.2 billion. This option would convert DSH payments into a block grant to states. In 2004, each state's grant would be 10 percent less than the estimated sum of Medicare DSH payments made to hospitals in that state in 2003. In sub \u0010 sequent years, the block grant would be indexed to the change in the consumer price index for urban consumers minus 1 percentage point. In return for the lower pay \u0010ments, states would gain more flexibility in how DSH funds were used. Those changes would decrease Medicare outlays by $730 million in 2004 and by $7.3 billion over five years. (The estimated savings include the fact that lower Medicare DSH payments would reduce payment updates to plans participating in Medicare+Choice.) Supporters of this option argue that the added flexibility provided to states under this option could result in DSH funds' being targeted more appropriately and equitably to facilities and providers that serve low \u0010income popula \u0010 tions. For example, rather than going solely to hospitals, such funds might also be used to support outpatient clin \u0010 ics that treat low \u0010income patients. Critics of this option argue that state governments might not increase their subsidies to make up for the reduction in federal payments. As a result, hospitals as a whole could receive less in combined federal and state funding. Additionally, allowing states to allocate DSH payments could change the distribution of assistance among hospitals, possibly causing some large urban hospitals to receive less public funding than they do now.

Those payments are determined on a per \u0010case basis: payment rates vary wi th the patient's diagnosis\u2014 which Medicare classifies using a system of diagnosis \u0010 related groups (DRGs)\u2014and with the characteristics of the hospital. Those rates take into account reasonable variations in the treatment of patients within a given DRG and offer hospitals an incentive to reduce the cost of treatment. PPS payments do not cover all services rendered to patients during their hospital stay. In partic \u0010 ular, Medicare pays separately for physicians' services pro \u0010 vided on an inpatient basis. This option would give hospitals the choice to receive a single global payment for high \u0010cost, high\u0010volume inpa \u0010 tient procedures\u2014a change that has been explored by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. That pay \u0010 ment would be lower than the separate payments now made for hospitals' operating costs and physicians' ser \u0010 vices, thus saving Medi care $100 million in 2004 and $500 million over the 2004 \u00102008 period. The global payment would cover such procedures as heart bypasssurgery, cataract surgery, coronary angioplasty, heart valve replacement, and joint replacement. Advocates of this option note that during a demonstra \u0010 tion project in the 1990s in which Medicare made global payments to seven hospitals for heart bypass surgery, Medicare outlays for those hospitals were about 10 per \u0010 cent lower, on average, than they would have been other \u0010 wise. In that demonstration, discounted payment rates were established through negotiations with participating hospitals in conjunction with teams of physicians. Sup \u0010 porters argue that global payments give both hospitals and physicians an incentive to reduce operating costs while maintaining a satisfactory standard of care. Hos \u0010 pitals could offset the declines in their Medicare pay \u0010 ments by improving efficiency (with resultant cost sav \u0010 ings) or by increasing their volume of patients (using new marketing efforts). Opponents argue that this option would not be widely applicable because only a handful of hospitals perform a significant number of such high \u0010cost, high\u0010volume in \u0010 patient procedures.148 BUDGET OPTIONS 570-07\u2014Mandatory Further Reduce the Medicare Prospective Payment System Update Factor for Hospitals ' Inpatient Operating Costs Total (Millions of dollars) 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2004-2008 2004-2013 Outlay Savings 900 2,000 3,200 4,500 6,000 16,600 75,700 Under Medicare's prospective payment system (PPS), payments for hospitals' operating costs for inpatient ser \u0010 vices provided to Medicare beneficiaries are determined on a per\u0010case basis, according to preset rates that vary with the patient's diagnosis and the characteristics of the hospital. Payment rates are ad justed each year using an update factor that is determined in part by the projected rise in the hospital market \u0010basket index (MBI), which re \u0010 flects increases in hospital costs. Changes in the MBI also affect payments for Medicare+Choice plans, because those payments are calculated taking into account Medi \u0010 care's payments to hospitals. Under current law, the hospital up date factor for 2003 is the change in the MBI minus 0.55 percentage points. After 2003, the update factor reverts to the full change in the MBI. This option would reduce the Medicare PPS update fac \u0010 tor to the annual change in the MBI minus 1.1 percent \u0010 age points. That rate would take effect in 2004 and con \u0010 tinue through at least 2013. Sa vings from that reduction would total $900 million next year and $16.6 billion over five years (including savings from reduced payments to Medicare+Choice plans). Supporters of this option argue that further reductions in the update factor are justifiable because hospitals' profit margins on Medicare inpatient services are rela \u0010 tively high. In 2002, when the update factor was also thechange in the MBI minus 0.55 percentage points, hos \u0010 pitals were expected to have an average profit margin of about 11 percent on Medicare inpatient services. Fur \u0010 thermore, when the update factor has been lower in the past, hospitals have been able to maintain fairly high in \u0010 patient profit margins by achieving greater efficiencies. In 1999, for example, when th e update factor was the change in the MBI minus 1.9 percentage points, those profit margins averaged about 12 percent. Critics of this option note that Medicare inpatient profit margins are overstated because Medicare's payment sys \u0010 tems have given hospitals an incentive to allocate too much of their overhead and ancillary costs to outpatient services. Thus, hospitals' profit margins on Medicare out \u0010 patient services are unders tated. (In 2002, those margins were expected to average about \u001016 percent.) Opponents of this option argue that hospitals' overall Medicare profit margins, which were expected to average about 4 percent in 2002, indicate that Medicare's total payments to hos \u0010 pitals for all services are reasonable. Therefore, critics argue, Medicare's payments for inpatient services should not be reduced without carefully evaluating the adequacy of payments for hospital outpatient services as well. Fi \u0010 nally, critics say, even with inpatient margins overstated, about one\u0010third of hospitals have negative profit margins on Medicare inpatient services; further reductions in the update factor could cause considerable hardship for those hospitals.CHAPTER TWO FUNCTION 570: MEDICARE 149 570-08\u2014Mandatory Further Reduce Medicare's Payments for Hospitals' Inpatient Capital-Related Costs Total (Millions of dollars) 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2004-2008 2004-2013 Outlay Savings 500 600 600 700 700 3,100 6,900 In 1992, Medicare sw itched its method of paying hos \u0010 pitals for the capital \u0010related costs of inpatient services from cost\u0010based reimbursement to a prospective payment system. Under that system, hospitals receive a predeter \u0010 mined amount for each Medicare patient to cover capital \u0010 related costs, which include depreciation, interest, taxes, insurance, and similar expenses for buildings and equip \u0010 ment. The prospective system for capital \u0010related costs applies to about 5,000 hospital s that are also paid under Medicare's prospective payment system for operating costs. In both systems, a hospital's prospective rate is ad \u0010 justed for its mix of patients and other characteristics. Analyses by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Ser \u0010 vices (CMS) suggest that the prospective rates for capital payments set in 1992 were too high. Those rates were based on 1989 data projecte d to 1992, but in actuality, capital costs grew more slowly than expected between 1989 and 1992. Moreover, the leve l of capital costs per case in 1989 that was used to set rates was probably higher than would be optimal in an efficient market because of incentives created by the Medicare payments. Factors such as changes in capital prices, the mix of pa \u0010 tients treated by hospitals, and the \"intensity\" of hospital services contributed to the overestimate, which the Medi \u0010 care Payment Advisory Commission and CMS estimated at between 15 percent and 28 percent, with an averageof about 22 percent. Consequently, the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 reduced the federal rate by 17.8 percent for capital payments made to hospitals for patient discharges occurring in 1998 through 2002. (A small part of that reduction, 2.1 percen tage points, was restored beginning this year.) This option would further reduce the prospective pay \u0010 ment rate for hospitals' capital \u0010related costs by 5 percent \u0010 age points\u2014bringing the total reduction to about 22 per \u0010 cent from the initial level. That change would lower Medicare outlays by $500 million in 2004 and $3.1 bil \u0010 lion over the 2004 \u00102008 period. Proponents of lower payments note that Medicare's payments for capital costs are a small share (less than 5 percent) of hospitals' total revenues. Most hospitals would probably be able to adjust to the reductions by lowering their capital costs or partially covering those costs with other sources of revenue. Opponents of this option argue that hospitals in poor financial condition could have difficulty absorbing the reductions. As a result, the quality of the care they offer could decline, and they might provide fewer services to people without health insurance.150 BUDGET OPTIONS 570-09\u2014Mandatory Increase the Number of Postacute Care Discharges Treated as Hospital Transfers Under Medicare Total (Millions of dollars) 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2004-2008 2004-2013 Outlay Savings 300 400 400 400 500 2,000 4,800 Medicare's prospective payment system (PPS) pays hos \u0010 pitals for inpatient treatment of Medicare beneficiaries on the basis of the patient's diagnosis. The PPS amounts were developed using data on costs for an average length of stay in a hospital for each diagnostic grouping. Over time, the average length of stay has decreased, particularly for patients in certain diagnosis \u0010related groups (DRGs) who are frequently discharged to postacute care settings, such as home health agencies and skilled nursing facilities. (In turn, Medicare's payments to postacute care providers have increased.) Medicare reduces its payment to an admitting hospital if a patient is transferred from that acute care hospital to another for related care. The final discharging hospital receives full payment, whereas the admitting hospital re \u0010 ceives a per diem payment not to exceed the full amount. Beginning in 1998, Medicare a pplied a similar policy to hospitals that discharge certain patients to postacute care settings. Specifically, hospitals receive reduced payments for patients in 10 DRGs who are transferred to a post \u0010 acute care setting if their stay in the admitting hospital is shorter than the average le ngth of stay for that DRG. Researchers evaluating the im pact of that change found that it lowered Medicare payments in 2001 by about $400 million.This option would extend the postacute transfer policy to a further 13 DRGs with the next \u0010highest rates of dis \u0010 charge to postacute care facilities. Doing so would reduce Medicare outlays by $300 million in 2004 and $2.0 bil \u0010 lion over five years. Supporters of this option argue that extending the post \u0010 acute transfer policy would not only save money for Medicare but also give hospitals greater incentive to en \u0010 sure that patients were fully ready to be discharged before transferring them to a postacute care setting. Critics of this option, including many hospitals, contend that the transfer policy (even in today's limited form) undermines one of the original incentives in the prospec \u0010 tive payment system\u2014to reduce hospital costs by dis \u0010 charging patients as soon as is practicable. Moreover, they argue, the policy creates an administrative burden for hospitals, which must verify discharge destinations, and may diminish the quality of care for some patients by en \u0010 couraging hospitals to delay postacute care placements following hospital discharges.CHAPTER TWO FUNCTION 570: MEDICARE 151 570-10\u2014Mandatory Reduce Medicare Payments for Currently Covered Prescription Drugs Total (Millions of dollars) 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2004-2008 2004-2013 Outlay Savings 450 700 710 790 920 3,580 10,890 Supplementary Medical Insurance (Part B of Medicare) paid providers about $5.5 billi on in 2001 for certain out \u0010 patient drugs. Prescription drugs are covered by Part B when they must be administered under a physician's su \u0010 pervision, as is the case with many drugs requiring injec \u0010 tion or infusion. Medicare also pays for drugs that must be delivered by durable medical equipment covered under the program. In addition, some oral chemotherapy and antinausea drugs for cancer patients, immunosuppressive drugs for recipients of organ transplants, and vaccines and certain drugs related to end \u0010stage renal disease are covered. Medicare's payments for covered prescription drugs deliv \u0010 ered at home and in physicians' offices have varied over time. Since 1998, those payments have been set at 95 per \u0010 cent of a drug's average wholesale price (AWP), which is a published list price established by the manufacturer. As a list price, however, the AWP is not the actual price that providers pay for drugs. Pegging Medicare's payment to the AWP has meant that providers and suppliers could profit from dispensing or administering Medicare \u0010cov\u0010 ered drugs. This option would limit Medicare's reimbursements for most prescription drugs by reducing the allowed charge from 95 percent to 85 percen t of the AWP and by limit \u0010 ing increases in that allowed charge to changes in the rate of inflation (as measured by the consumer price index for all urban consumers, excludin g food and energy). As a result, net outlays for Medicare Part B would decline by $450 million next year and by a total of $3.6 billion be \u0010 tween 2004 and 2008. Proponents of this option point to recent evidence sug \u0010 gesting that acquisition costs for many Medicare Part B drugs are about one \u0010fourth less than Medicare's reim \u0010 bursement rate, on average. A 2001 report by the Inspec \u0010tor General of the Department of Health and Human Services examined pricing of the top 24 drugs that con \u0010 stitute 80 percent of Part B drug spending. The report concluded that if Medicare's reimbursement rates had been set at those drugs' acquisition costs, spending on the drugs would have been redu ced by 25 percent, or $761 million. An attempt by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to use market forces to gauge acquisition costs yielded similar results. CMS included several nebulizer drugs in a competitive \u0010bidding demon \u0010 stration project covering durable medical equipment and related supplies in Texas. On the basis of preliminary data, CMS reported that the reimbursement amounts set for those drugs using competitive bids were about 26 per \u0010 cent below the typical Part B reimbursement rate. Opponents of this option argue that it would encourage manufacturers to introduce new drugs at elevated AWPs in order to restore profit margins for physicians and other suppliers. Physicians would prescribe newly introduced drugs more quickly as a result. Therefore, the option's effectiveness in limiting the growth of Part B spending would gradually erode as new drugs replaced older ones in the mix of covered drugs. (Another approach for ap \u0010 proximating the acquisition costs of Medicare Part B drugs would be to require manufacturers to report their average sales price for a drug, including discounts and rebates. The reimbursement rate could be based on that reported transaction price.) Critics of this option also claim that the profit margins physicians now get when they dispense drugs to Medicare patients subsidize their administrative costs. Savings would be reduced and patient care might suffer if patients were diverted from physicians' offices to hospital out \u0010 patient settings, where Medicare payment rates are higher. (The estimate of savings from this option ac \u0010 counts for that possibility.) RELATED OPTION : 570\u001011152 BUDGET OPTIONS 570-11\u2014Mandatory Require Competitive Bidding for High-Volume Items of Durable Medical Equipment Total (Millions of dollars) 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2004-2008 2004-2013 Outlay Savings 0 20 60 110 160 360 1,480 Medicare paid about $5.3 billi on for supplie s of durable medical equipment (DME), orthotics, and prosthetics last year, the Congressional Budget Office estimates. Sup \u0010 pliers of DME are paid according to a fee schedule that reflects their historical charges to Medicare rather than current market prices. Both the General Accounting Of \u0010 fice and the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) have determined that Medicare's payments for many of those items far exceed the prices that other insurers pay or the prices charged in retail stores. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 authorized HHS to conduct several competitive \u0010bidding demonstrations for durable medical equipment. Two such demonstrations have taken place: first in Polk County, Florida, and m ore recently in San Antonio, Texas. Bidders competed on the basis of price and quality for several categories of medical supplies. (Some of those categories differed in the two demonstrations, but oxygen supplies and hospital beds were included in both cases.) Only a limited number of bidders were selected as Medicare suppliers for each prod \u0010 uct, and other suppliers were generally not permitted to provide those products to fee \u0010for\u0010service Medicare bene \u0010 ficiaries in the area. Savings from the Florida competition averaged 17 percent across all product categories and were as high as 30 percent for hos pital beds. Based on the bids it received in San Antonio, HHS set payment rates that averaged about 20 percent less than Medicare's current fee schedule for the items covered by that demonstration. Under this option, Medicare would use competitive bid \u0010 ding to buy high \u0010volume DME supplies in all areas of the country that have large numbers of suppliers. Savings would probably be lower in some competitive \u0010bidding areas than those seen in the demonstrations. Even so,using that approach to purchase just two high \u0010volume DME items\u2014oxygen supplies and hospital beds\u2014would reduce Medica re outlays by abou t $20 million in 2005 and a total of $360 million through 2008. (Savings would not begin until 2005 be cause of the time needed to implement the competitive \u0010bidding system.) HHS would incur additional administrative costs for imple \u0010 mentation, which are not included in CBO's estimate \u2014but those added costs would most likely represent only a small percentage of the savings shown here. Supporters of competitive bidding note that Medicare beneficiaries pay 20 percent coinsurance on DME items, so lower prices for those items would reduce their out \u0010 of\u0010pocket costs. In addition, beneficiaries pay about 25 percent of Medicare's costs for DME items through their monthly Medicare premiums, so the savings for Medicare would be accompanied by a proportional decrease in those premium payments. Critics of competitive bidding raise several concerns. One is that beneficiaries could find it more difficult to obtain DME items that were competitively bid. Beneficiaries' access to suppliers has been a major consideration in de \u0010 termining the number of winning bidders in the HHS demonstrations. In addition , beneficiarie s who were re \u0010 ceiving durable medical equipment at the start of each demonstration were allowed to continue using the same supplier even if it was not one of the winning bidders. Initial evaluations in both Florida and Texas found that no significant access problems arose (and that lesser prob \u0010 lems were resolved). Another concern is that fewer suppliers of oxygen and hospital beds would be participating in Medicare under this option than under current law. In cases in whichCHAPTER TWO FUNCTION 570: MEDICARE 153 Medicare represented a large share of the total market for those supplies, over time this option could reduce the extent of competition among suppliers or at least give HHS a large role in determining which suppliers wereviable. Competitive bidding could also create financial hardship for suppliers that were not selected in the bid \u0010 ding process if Medicare was a major source of their revenue.154 BUDGET OPTIONS 570-12\u2014Mandatory Increase Medicare's Premium for Supplementary Medical Insurance to 30 Percent of Benefit Costs Total (Millions of dollars) 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2004-2008 2004-2013 Outlay Savings 3,520 5,380 6,050 Medicare offers insurance coverage for physicians' services and hospital outpatient services through its Supple \u0010 mentary Medical Insurance (S MI) program, or Part B of Medicare. SMI benefits are partially funded from monthly premiums paid by enrollees, with the remainder funded from general federal revenues. Although the SMI premium was initially intended to cover 50 percent of the cost of benefits, that sh are declined between 1975 and 1983, reaching less than 25 pe rcent. The drop occurred because premium increases were limited by the cost \u0010of\u0010 living adjustment (COLA) for Social Security benefits (which is based on the consumer price index), but the per capita cost of the SMI program rose faster than that. Premiums are now set to cover about 25 percent of aver \u0010 age SMI benefits for an aged enrollee. This option would raise the SMI premium to cover 30 percent of the cost of Part B benefits, beginning in 2004. That increase would sa ve $3.5 billion in 2004 and $28.7 billion over five year s and would raise the 2004 premium for enrollees to $78.10 per month instead of $65.10. The estimated savings sh own here assume a con \u0010 tinuation of the current hold \u0010harmless provisions, which ensure that no Medicare enrollee's monthly Social Secu \u0010 rity benefit will fall because the dollar amount of theSocial Security COLA is smaller than the dollar increase in the SMI premium. (SMI premiums are deducted from Social Security checks for most enrollees.) Advocates of higher premiums argue that unlike pro \u0010 posals such as boosting cost \u0010sharing requirements, which could substantially raise out \u0010of\u0010pocket costs for SMI en \u0010 rollees who become seriously ill, this option would affect enrollees broadly and raise their costs only a little. More \u0010 over, the option need not affect enrollees with income below 120 percent of the federal pove rty line and few assets because they are eligible to have Medicaid pay their Medicare premiums (although not everyone who is eli \u0010 gible for Medicaid applies for benefits). Critics of this option argue that low \u0010income enrollees who are not eligible for Medicaid could find the higher premiums burdensome. A few might drop SMI coverage and either do without care or turn to sources of free or reduced\u0010cost care, which could increase demands on local governments. In addition, states' expenditures would rise because states would pay part of the higher premium costs for those Medicare enrollees who also receive Medicaid benefits.

For example, individuals with modified adjusted gross in \u0010 come of less than $50,000 and couples with income below $75,000 would continue to pay the current premi \u0010 um, set at 25 percent of SMI costs per aged enrollee. But premiums would rise progressively for higher \u0010income enrollees, reaching 50 percent of costs for individuals with income of more than $100,000 and for couples with income exceeding $150,000. Those premiums might have to be collected through the income tax system, so that rates could be aligned with income, rather than deducted from Social Security checks, as they are now for most enrollees. If this option t ook effect on January 1, 2004, savings would total $1.3 billion in 2004 and $12.1 billion over the 2004\u00102008 period. Those estima tes assume that the current hold \u0010harmless provisions would continue only for people subject to the basic 25 percent premium. (The hold\u0010harmless provisions ensure that no Medicare en \u0010rollee's Social Security check will decline because the dol \u0010 lar increase in the SMI premium exceeds the dollar amount of the Social Security cost \u0010of\u0010living adjustment.) Proponents of this option argue that it would affect only a small fraction of SMI enrollees. Roughly 84 percent of enrollees would still pay the basic 25 percent premium, only 4 percent would pay the maximum premium, and 12 percent would pay an amount in between. Opponents of this option counter that enrollees subject to the income \u0010related premiums could pay substantially more than they do today. For example, the maximum premium for 2004 would be $126.60 per month instead of the $65.10 projected under cu rrent law. That increase might lead some enrollees to drop out of the SMI pro \u0010 gram. Enrollees with retiree health plans that do not require Medicare enrollment (mainly retired government employees) would be most likely to drop SMI coverage. Some healthy enrollees who have no other source of health insurance might do so as well, if they were not averse to the risk that they could incur large health care costs.

That deductible is now $100 a year. This option would increase the SMI deductible each year, beginning in 2004, for the annu al growth in total spend \u0010 ing per enrollee for SMI services. That change would save the program $100 million in 2004 and $1.6 billion over five years. Supporters of an increase point out that the SMI deduc \u0010 tible has been raised only three times since Medicare began in 1966, when it was set at $50. Then, the deduc \u0010 tible equaled roughly 45 percent of average annual percapita charges under the SM I program, whereas by 2000 it equaled just 3 percent. Moreover, supporters say, rais \u0010 ing the deductible would give enrollees a greater eco \u0010 nomic incentive to use medical care prudently. Even with the increase, enrollees would not pay significantly more out of pocket. In 2004, the deductible would be $104, so no enrollee's out \u0010of\u0010pocket costs would rise by more than $4 in that year. Critics of a higher deductible argue that over time, the additional out \u0010of\u0010pocket costs under this option might discourage some low \u0010income enrollees who are not eli \u0010 gible for Medicaid from seeking needed care. In addition, states' costs would rise because their Medicaid programs pay the deductibles for Medicare enrollees who also re \u0010 ceive benefits under Medicaid.CHAPTER TWO FUNCTION 570: MEDICARE 157 570-15\u2014Mandatory Simplify and Limit Medicare's Cost-Sharing Requirements Total (Millions of dollars) 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2004-2008 2004-2013 Outlay Savings 970 require \u0010 ments vary significantly by the type of service provided. For example, Medicare beneficiaries who are hospitalized must pay a Part A deductible of more than $800 per spell of illness and can be subject to increasing levels of coin \u0010 surance for very long hospital stays. For outpatient ser \u0010 vices covered under Part B of Medicare, the deductible has remained $100 a year since 1991. Beyond that de \u0010 ductible, beneficiaries pay 20 percent of the allowable cost of most Part B services. Certain Medicare services, such as home health visits or clinical laboratory tests, require no cost sharing. As a result of those variations, beneficiaries may not consider relative costs accurately when choosing among alternative treatments. Moreover, if Medicare patients experience high medical costs, they can face unlimited cost \u0010sharing expenses, since the pro \u0010 gram does not cap those expenses. Medicare could simplify and limit cost \u0010sharing require \u0010 ments in its fee \u0010for\u0010service sector while also reducing federal costs. This option would replace the current com \u0010 plicated mix of cost sharing with a single combined de \u0010 ductible (covering all services in Parts A and B of Medi \u0010 care), a uniform coinsurance rate of 20 percent for amounts above that deductib le, and a cap on each bene \u0010 ficiary's total cost \u0010sharing liabilities. If the option took effect on January 1, 2004, fe deral savings would total $970 million in 2004 and $10.6 bi llion over five years. The combined deductible would be $600 in 2004, and the cap on total cost shar ing would be $3,400. In later years, those amounts would grow at the same rate as per capita Medicare benefits. Those estimates assume that the new Medicare cost \u0010 sharing rules would be mandatory. In contrast, some re \u0010 cent Congressional proposals to revise fee \u0010for\u0010service Medicare would allow beneficiaries to decide whether they wanted to enroll under new cost \u0010sharing require \u0010ments. If participation was voluntary rather than manda \u0010 tory, savings from this option would fall significantly and could even turn into costs\u2014particularly if the only parti \u0010 cipants were people who would pay less in cost sharing under the new rules than under current law. Supporters of this option argue that it would have several advantages besides reducing federal spending for Medi \u0010 care. First, the option would cap beneficiaries' out \u0010of\u0010 pocket expenses, which could particularly help people who have serious illnesses or require hospitalization. Sec \u0010 ond, it would increase the incentives for enrollees to use medical services prudently. By design, deductibles and coinsurance are mechanisms for exposing beneficiaries to some of the financial consequences of their choices about the use of health services. This option's combined deductible would be higher than the deductible under Part B (the vast majority of Medicare enrollees do not need to pay the Part A deductible in a given year); thus, people without supplemental coverage or with a medigap plan that did not cover the deductible would face the full cost for a larger proportion of the services they used. Moreover, the uniform coinsurance rate of 20 percent on all services would encourage enrollees without supple \u0010 mental coverage to consider relative costs when choosing among various treatments. Third, the resulting reductions in costs for Medicare's Part B program would translate into lower premiums for enrollees. Although this option is consistent with steps that some private insurers and employers are taking to control the growth of health spending, opponents would argue that, in general, it would increase Medicare's cost \u0010sharing re \u0010 quirements for most enrollees. Cost \u0010sharing expenses would fall substantially for about 8 percent of enrollees, stay the same for nearly 16 percent, and rise modestly for the other 77 percent. However, most Medicare benefi \u0010 ciaries would be insulated from those direct effects be \u0010158 BUDGET OPTIONS cause they have supplemental coverage; instead, some would see the effects in the form of higher premiums for supplemental policies. In addition, the option would make beneficiaries responsible for paying coinsurance oncertain services\u2014 such as ho me health care\u2014that are not now subject to cost sharing, which would increase admin \u0010 istrative costs for some types of health care providers.

On average, medigap policyholders use at least 25 percent more services than Medicare bene \u0010 ficiaries who have no supplemental coverage and about 10 percent more services than beneficiaries who have sup \u0010 plemental coverage from their former employer (which tends to reduce but not eliminate their cost \u0010sharing lia \u0010 bilities). However, it is taxpayers (through Medicare)\u2014 not medigap insurers or policyholders\u2014who pay most of the cost of those additional services. Federal costs for Medicare could be reduced if medigap plans were restructured so that policyholders faced some cost sharing for Medicare services while still having their out\u0010of\u0010pocket costs limited. This option would bar medi \u0010 gap policies from paying an y of the first $600 of an en \u0010 rollee's cost \u0010sharing liabilit ies for calendar year 2004 and would limit coverage to 50 percent of the next $2,800 in Medicare cost sharing. (All further cost sharing would be covered, so enrollees coul d not pay more than $2,000 in cost sharing that year.) If those dollar lim its were indexed to growth in the average value of Medicare's costs for later years, savings would total almost $1.9 billion in 2004 and $14.4 billion over five years. Those estimates assume that all current and future medigap policies are required to meet the new standards; savings would be much lower if\u2014as in some recent proposals\u2014the new medigap design was optional. Proponents of this option argue that most Medicare en \u0010 rollees who have medigap policies would be better off fi \u0010 nancially as a result. Because insurers that offer medigap plans must compete against each other for business, theywould most likely reduce premiums to reflect the lower costs of providing the new policies. Indeed, most medi \u0010 gap policyholders would have smaller annual expenses under this option because their medigap premiums would decline by more than their cost \u0010sharing liabilities would increase. (Part of the reason is that premiums for medigap policies are generally somewhat higher than the average cost \u0010sharing liabilities that the policies cover, be \u0010 cause of the administrative and other costs that medigap insurers incur, but the primary reason is that most of those liabilities are generated by a relatively small number of policyholders.) Greater exposure to Medicare's cost sharing could even lead some medigap policyholders to forgo treatments that would yield them few or no net health benefits. Indi rectly, the decline in Medicare's costs would also cause that program's monthly premiums (which cover about 25 percent of costs for Part B of Medicare) to fall, so other Medicare beneficiaries would also be better off. This option could have several drawbacks, however. Medigap policyholders would face more uncertainty about their out \u0010of\u0010pocket costs. For that reason, some policyholders might object to being barred from pur \u0010 chasing first \u0010dollar coverage, even if they would be better off financially in most years under this option. (Most medigap policyholders buy optional coverage of the $100 Part B deductible; new high \u0010deductible medigap policies have attracted only limited enrollment despite their sub \u0010 stantially lower premiums.) Moreover, in any given year, about a quarter of medigap policyholders would incur higher total costs under this option than they would un \u0010 der the current system, and those with expensive chronic conditions might be worse off year after year. Finally, the decline in use of services by medigap policyholders (which would generate the federal savings under this option) might adversely affect their health in some cases. RELATED OPTIONS : 570\u001015 and 570 \u001017160 BUDGET OPTIONS 570-17\u2014Mandatory Combine Medicare Cost-Sharing Changes with Medigap Restrictions Total (Millions of dollars) 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2004-2008 limiting Medicare's cost\u0010sharing requirements (option 570 \u001015) could be greatly increased by restricting medigap coverage at the same time (option 570 \u001016). In fact, savings from carrying out both changes together would be greater than the sum of savings from either one alone. Under this option, medigap plans would be prohibited from covering any of the $600 combined deductible for Medicare in 2004 (descr ibed in option 570 \u001015) and could not cover more than 50 percent of remaining cost \u0010 sharing requirements, up to a limit of $3,400 a year on out\u0010of\u0010pocket spending. Such a medigap policy would correspond to the one described in option 570 \u001016, with coverage limited to 50 pe rcent of the next $2,800 in Medicare cost sharing (thus capping out \u0010of\u0010pocket ex\u0010 penses at $2,000 in 2004). If those various dollar limits were indexed to growth in per capita benefits paid by Medicare, this option would save almost $3.0 billion next year and $26.1 billi on over the 2004 \u00102008 period. Those estimates assume that participation in Medicare's new cost\u0010sharing requirements would be mandatory and that all medigap policies would be required to follow thenew standards. That approach differs from some recent Congressional proposals, in which beneficiaries could de \u0010 cide whether they wanted to enroll in a new cost \u0010sharing system. With voluntary participation, savings would be lower\u2014or could even become costs\u2014if the only enrollees in the new program were people who would pay less in cost sharing than they would under current law. This option would appreciably strengthen incentives for more prudent use of medical services by raising the initial threshold of health costs that most Medicare beneficiaries faced and by prohibiting medigap plans from covering that deductible or more than half of Medicare's addi \u0010 tional cost \u0010sharing requirements. As a result, the five \u0010year savings from this option would be $1.1 billion larger than the sum of savings achieved from options 570 \u001015 and 570\u001016. Despite the new catastrophic cap, which would protect Medicare enrollees against very large out \u0010of\u0010pocket ex\u0010 penses, some enrollees would object to this option or any other policy that denied them access to first \u0010dollar sup \u0010 plemental coverage.

Medicare's payment is set by a fee schedule, and providers must accept that fee as full payment for the service. For most other services provided under Medicare's Supple \u0010 mentary Medical Insurance (SMI) program, beneficiaries are subject to both a $100 de ductible and a coinsurance rate of 20 percent. This option would impose the SMI program's usual de \u0010 ductible and coinsurance requirements on laboratory services, beginning on January 1, 2004. That change would yield appreciable fede ral savings: $670 million in 2004 and $5.3 billion ov er five years. Supporters of this option argue that besides reducing Medicare's costs, this change would make cost \u0010sharing requirements under the SMI program more uniform and therefore easier to understand. Moreover, enrollees mightbe less likely to undergo laboratory tests with little ex \u0010 pected benefit if they paid part of the costs themselves. Critics of this option counter that enrollees' use of labor \u0010 atory services would probably not be substantially affected because decisions about what tests are appropriate are generally left to physicians, whose judgments do not appear to depend on enrollees' cost \u0010sharing liabilities. Thus, only a small part of the expected savings from this option would stem from more prudent use of laboratory services; the rest would reflect the transfer to enrollees of costs now borne by Medicare. Moreover, the billing costs of some providers, such as independent laboratories, would be higher under this option because those pro \u0010 viders would have to bill both Medicare and enrollees to collect their full fees. (Currently, they have no need to bill enrollees directly for clinical laboratory services.) In addi \u0010 tion, states' Medicaid costs would increase for Medicare enrollees who also receive Medicaid benefits.162 BUDGET OPTIONS 570-19\u2014Mandatory Reduce Medicare Payments for Home Health Care Total (Millions of dollars) 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2004-2008 2004-2013 Outlay Savings 280 790 1,400 2,160 Last year, Medica re paid about $10 billion for home health care services\u2014including intermittent skilled nurs \u0010 ing care as well as physical therapy and speech therapy\u2014 for beneficiaries who were deemed to be homebound. Medicare spending on home health services grew rapidly in the mid \u00101990s, when agencies we re reimbursed sepa \u0010 rately for each home health visit, but fell sharply after new payment systems were implemented under the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. Since 2001, home health agencies have generally been paid a fixed amount for providing all covered services for a 60 \u0010day period (known as a home health \"episode\"). The payments are adjusted prospec \u0010 tively on the basis of factors related to each beneficiary's expected need for care; in 2001, payments ranged from $1,114 to $5,947 per episode. Un der current law, pay\u0010 ments per episode are generally indexed to annual changes in input costs. Although the per \u0010episode payment rates for 2003 were cut by about 7 percent because of statutory reductions in payment limits, an analysis by the General Accounting Office (GAO) suggests that those payments will exceed home health agencies' estima ted costs by an average of 25 percent. (GAO found that payments outstrip average costs in 75 of Medicare's 80 payment categories for home health care, with the extent of the difference ranging from a few percent to as much as 72 percent for the most com \u0010 mon payment categories.) The disparity between home health payments and agencies' costs primarily reflects the fact that the per \u0010episode payment amounts were based on the number of visits made under the previous pay \u0010 ment system, but the number of visits per episode has fallen by about one \u0010third under the current payment system. This option would freeze the base payment for each home health episode at its 2003 level ($2,159) through 2007to gradually narrow the gap between payments and costs. In addition, the option assumes that adjustments would be made among the 80 home health payment categories to bring payments more closely into line with costs in each case. Those changes would reduce Medicare outlays by $280 million in 2004 and by $7.2 billion over the 2004\u00102008 period. (The estimates of savings assume that cuts in average payment levels will be partially offset by an increase in the share of patients assigned to higher \u0010 payment categories, a practice called \"up \u0010coding.\" The estimates also take into account other responses that reduce the effect of those cuts on total spending.) Advocates of this option argue that if average per \u0010episode costs for home health agencies grew at the rate of infla \u0010 tion, this reduction would still leave average payments at least 10 percent above agen cies' average costs for 2007 and beyond. That difference would provide a margin for agencies whose costs were slightly higher than average or that experienced faster cost growth. Opponents of this option argue that it could reduce ac \u0010 cess to home health services for Medicare beneficiaries. If Medicare payments were moved closer to the average costs of home health agencies, agencies with substantially higher costs would eventually have to reduce their oper \u0010 ating expenses or cease participating in the program. If the remaining agencies did not have enough capacity to serve all of the Medicare beneficiaries requiring home health care\u2014or could not do so at costs that were at or below the revised payment rates\u2014some beneficiaries would have difficulty receiving home health services. Lower payment rates could also lead some of those agen \u0010 cies to reduce the level or quality of services they provided to beneficiaries during a 60 \u0010day episode (although such concerns arise under any system of fixed prospective pay \u0010 ments).

But the Congressional Budget Office projects that use of home health services and the resulting costs will grow rapidly over the coming decade. One reason for the unrestrained growth is that Medicare beneficiaries are not required to pay any of the cost of home health services covered by the program. This option would charge beneficiaries a copayment amounting to 10 percent of the total cost of each home health episode (60 \u0010day period of services) covered by Medicare, beginning on January 1, 2004. That change would yield net fede ral savings of $1 billion in 2004 and $8.7 billion over five years.By shifting part of the cost of each home health episode to beneficiaries, this option would reduce the use of hom e health services\u2014at least among the less than 10 percent of enrollees in fee \u0010for\u0010service Medicare who do not have supplementary coverage for their cost \u0010sharing expenses. However, it would also increase the risk of very large out \u0010 of\u0010pocket costs for those enrollees. Little or no drop in use would be expected among the more than 90 percent of enrollees who have Medicaid, medigap, or employ \u0010 ment\u0010based supplementary cove rage. Thus, the 31 per \u0010 cent of enrollees with private medigap policies would be likely to face higher premiums, and the costs of the Medicaid program would rise on behalf of the 17 percent of Medicare enrollees who also receive Medicaid benefits.

Those programs usually pay the differ \u0010 ence between 30 percent of a household's income (after certain adjustments) and a local payment standard. In 2002, the average federal expend iture per assisted house \u0010 hold for all of HUD's rental housing programs combined was roughly $6,200, the Congressional Budget Office estimates. That amount included both housing subsidies and fees paid to administering agencies. This option would increase tenants' rent contributions over a five \u0010year period from 30 pe rcent to 35 percent of their adjusted income. Savings in outlays would total $173 million in 2004 and alm ost $5.4 billion over five years, including $4.0 billion for Section 8 programs and $1.3 billion for public housin g. (The estimates shown here assume that lawmakers will provide budget authority to extend the life of all commitments for housing aid that are due to expir e during the 2004 \u00102013 period.) Supporters of this option might argue that to blunt the impact of the change on assisted tenants, state govern \u0010 ments\u2014which currently contribute no funds to the fed \u0010eral rental assistance programs\u2014could be encouraged to make up some or all of the decreased federal support. One rationale for directly involving states is that housing assistance programs generate substantial local benefits, such as improved quality of the housing stock. Moreover, since eligibility for housing aid is determined by each area's median income, tying states' contributions to rent \u0010 ers' incomes (assuming that every state increased its con \u0010 tribution) would ensure that lower \u0010income states would pay less per assisted family than higher \u0010income states would. Opponents of this option could argue that not all states would make up the reduction in federal assistance. As a result, housing costs could increase for some current recipients of aid, who generally have very low income. This option could also cause some relatively high \u0010income renters in assisted \u0010housing projects to move out, because paying an additional 5 percent of their income for such housing could be more expensive than renting an unas \u0010 sisted unit. As those tenants were replaced by new ones with lower income, the concentration of families with very low income in assisted \u0010housing projects would in \u0010 crease and the savings from this option would decline (in some situations, the cost of the public housing program could rise).

Support for that second type of assistance comes in the form of Section 8 vouchers, which generally reduce the amount that recipi \u0010 ents spend for housing to 30 percent of their income. Specifically, Section 8 programs pay the difference be \u0010 tween 30 percent of a tenant's income (after certain ad \u0010 justments) and a payment standard determined by local rental levels. The payment standard and the amount of the federal sub \u0010 sidy both vary according to the type of unit in which the tenant lives. Generally, one \u0010person households may live in apartments with up to one bedroom, whereas larger households may reside in bigger units. This option would link the rent subsidy for a newly as \u0010 sisted one \u0010person household (or for a currently assisted person who moves to another unit) to the cost of an effi \u0010 ciency apartment rather than a one \u0010bedroom apartment. That change would save $24 million in federal outlays next year and $659 mi llion over the 2004 \u00102008 period. Advocates of this option would argue that an efficiency unit provides adequate space for someone living alone. Opponents would counter that renters in some areas might have difficulty finding suitable housing under the new rule and, as a result, mi ght have to spend more than 30 percent of their inco me for available units.

Among other conditions, they must have income at or below 130 percent of the fede ral poverty li ne and have countable assets of less than $2,000. Countable assets exclude certain items, such as the value of a house and the value of a car up to a set limit. Once eligibility for the program has been determined, the value of the benefit is calculated. A household is expected to contribute 30 percent of its net income (gross income minus deductions for personal expenses) for food expen \u0010 ditures. The Department of Agriculture has determined the monthly cost of a \"Thrifty Food Plan\" for a given household size. A household's food stamp benefit equals the amount by which the monthly cost of the Thrifty Food Plan exceeds 30 percent of the household's net monthly income. For one \u0010 and two\u0010person households,a minimum benefit exists: if the calculated benefit is less than $10, the food stamp benefit is set at $10. This option would eliminate food stamp benefits for households whose calculated benefit is less than $10 a month. Savings from that change would total $90 million in 2004 and $455 million over the 2004 \u00102008 period. Proponents of this option argue that it would concentrate food stamp benefits on recipients with the greatest cal \u0010 culated need because the people who would lose benefits are those who have the highest expected contribution to their monthly food costs. Critics argue that eliminating benefits for households elig ible for less th an $10 a month might discourage those households from reapplying for the program if their financial situation changed. That dis \u0010 couraging effect could lessen the extent to which the pro \u0010 gram achieved its goal of aiding low \u0010income households.CHAPTER TWO FUNCTION 600: INCOME SECURITY 169 600-04\u2014Mandatory Target the Subsidy for Certain Meals in Child Nutrition Programs Total (Millions of dollars) 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2004-2008 2004-2013 Outlay Savings 85 555 655 670 680 2,650 6,125 The School Lunch Program and the School Breakfast Program provide funds to pa rticipating schools to sub \u0010 sidize lunches and breakfasts for children. Participating schools must offer free meals to children with family income below 130 percent of the federal po verty line, reduced\u0010price meals to children with family income between 130 percent and 185 percent of the poverty line, and full\u0010price meals to children with family income above 185 percent of the poverty line . Most schools that partici \u0010 pate in the lunch program also participate in the breakfast program. The subsidy rate per meal does not vary with the cost that the school incurs in providing the lunch or breakfast\u2014it depends solely on the family income of the student re \u0010 ceiving the meal. For the 2002 \u00102003 school year, the fed \u0010 eral subsidies amount to $2.14 per lunch and $1.17 per breakfast for students re ceiving free meals, $1.74 per lunch and $0.87 per brea kfast for reduced \u0010price meals, and $0.20 per lunch and $0.22 per breakfast for full \u0010price meals. (Schools with large numbers of participating stu \u0010 dents can get an additional subsidy.) The school sets theprices it charges students for reduced \u0010price and full \u0010price meals, although the reduced \u0010price meal cannot cost more than 40 cents. This option would eliminate the breakfast and lunch sub \u0010 sidy for full \u0010price meals for students with family income above 350 percent of the pove rty line, beginning in July 2004. At the same time, it woul d increase the subsidy for reduced\u0010price meals by $0.20 fo r both breakfast and lunch. Those changes would yield net savings of $85 mil \u0010 lion in 2004 and more than $2.6 billion over five years. Supporters of this option argue that there is no clear justification for subsidizing meals for children who are not from low \u0010income families. Opponents argue that if a school has been using funds from the full \u0010price subsidy to offset the cost of administering its breakfast and lunch programs, it might decide to raise meal prices for students from higher \u0010income families or drop out of the program. The latter outcome would mean that students who were eligible for free or reduced \u0010price meals would no longer receive them.170 BUDGET OPTIONS 600-05\u2014Mandatory Reduce the $20 Exclusion for Unearned Income Under the Supplemental Security Income Program Total (Millions of dollars) 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2004-2008 2004-2013 Outlay Savings 90 135 125 115 130 595 1,260 The federal Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program provides monthly cash payments\u2014based on uniform, nationwide eligibility rules\u2014to low \u0010income elderly and disabled people. In addition, many states provide supple \u0010 mental payments. Because SSI is a means \u0010tested program, recipients' outside income reduces their SSI benefits, subject to certain exclusions. For unearned income (most of which consists of Social Security benefits), $20 a month is excluded; SSI benefits are reduced dollar for dollar for unearned income above that amount. The pro \u0010 gram allows a larger exclusion for earned income (such as wages) to encourage SSI recipients to work. This option would reduce the exclusion for unearned in \u0010 come from $20 a month to $15. That reduction wouldsave $90 million in 2004 and $595 million over five years. Advocates of this option argue that a program designed to ensure a minimum standard of living for its recipients need not provide a higher standard for people who hap \u0010 pen to have unearned income. But opponents point out that reducing the monthly exclusion by $5 would de \u0010 crease by as much as $60 a ye ar the income of the roughly 2.3 million low \u0010income people (approximately 35 percent of all federal SSI recipients) who would otherwise benefit from the exclusion in 2004.

In addition, many states provide supplemental payments to SSI recipients. In 2002, children received approximately $5.3 billion, or almost one \u0010sixth, of federal SSI benefits. Unlike other means \u0010tested benefits, the SSI payment for an additional child does not decline as the number of SSI recipients in a family increases. In 2003, a family with one child qualifying for SSI benefits could receive up to $552 a month, or $6,624 a year, if the family's income (excluding SSI benefits) was under the cap for the maxi \u0010 mum benefit. If the family had additional eligible chil \u0010 dren, it could rece ive another $552 a month for each one. (A child's benefit is based only on the presence of a severe disability and the family's income and resources, not on the nature of the qualifying disability or on participation by other family members in the SSI program.) This option would create a sliding scale for SSI disability benefits so that a family would get smaller benefits per child as its number of children receiving SSI increased. The sliding scale used in this option was recommended by the National Commission on Childhood Disability in 1995. It would keep the maximum benefit for one child the same as in current law but reduce benefits for additional recipient children in the same family. If thatsliding scale was in place in 2003, the first child in a family qualifying for the maximum benefit would con \u0010 tinue to receive $552 a mont h, but the second child would get $333, and the thir d would receive $291. Bene \u0010 fits would continue to decrease for additional children. As with current SSI benefits, the slid ing scale would be adjusted each year to reflect changes in the consumer price index. This option assumes that the change would not be carried out until 2005 because the Soci al Security Administration does not maintain data on multiple SSI recipients in a family, so implementing the sliding scale would require significant effort on the agency's part. Savings from this option would total $70 million in 2005 and $485 million between 2005 and 2008. Proponents of a sliding scale argue that the reductions in benefits it would produce reflect economies of scale that generally affect the cost of living for families with more than one child. Moreover, the high medical costs that dis \u0010 abled children often incur, which would not be subject to economies of scale, would continue to be covered be \u0010 cause SSI participants are generally eligible for Medicaid. Opponents of this option could argue that children with disabilities sometimes have unique needs that may not be covered by Medicaid, including modifications to their housing and specialized equipment. With lower SSI bene \u0010 fits, some families might be unable to meet such needs.

The federal government pays 50 percent of most administrative costs for the programs, including costs for child placement services; state and local govern \u0010 ments pay the remaining share. However, the federal government pays higher matching rates for certain activi \u0010 ties to induce local administrators to undertake more of them. For example, the federal government pays 75 per \u0010 cent of the costs of training administrators and prospec \u0010 tive foster and adoptive parents. This option would reduce the matching rates for all ad \u0010 ministrative and training expenses in the Foster Care and Adoption Assistance program s to 50 percent, thus elim i \u0010 nating special rates for specific activities. That change would decrease fe deral outlays by $125 million in 2004 and by $765 million ov er five years. Proponents of this option could argue that because the higher matching rate for training and related expenses has been in place for many years, it is unclear whether states require that rate to provide those services. Reducing the matching rate to 50 percent would shed some light onstates' willingness to pay a larger share of those costs, as well as bring the matching rate in line with that for ad \u0010 ministrative expenses. Critics argue that states might respond to this option by reducing their administrative efforts, which could raise program costs and offset some of the federal savings. Spe \u0010 cifically, states might make less of an effort to eliminate waste and abuse in payments to providers. Or they might provide less training for administrators and parents or reduce the payments and other services that the programs offer. Such reductions could be especially likely because many states are facing budget shortfalls. Under the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995, cuts in federal funding for some entitlement grant programs \u2014including Foster Care and Adoption Assistance\u2014are considered mandates on state governments if the states lack authority to amend their programmatic or financial responsibilities to offset the loss of funding. Because some states may not have sufficient flexibility within the Foster Care and Adoption Assistance programs to make such changes, this option could constitute an unfunded federal mandate under the law.CHAPTER TWO FUNCTION 600: INCOME SECURITY 173 600-08\u2014Mandatory Limit Some Cost-of-Living Adj ustments for Federal Retirees Total (Millions of dollars) 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2004-2008 2004-2013 Outlay Savings 200 490 790 1,120 1,470 Annuitants under the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) receive annual cost \u0010of\u0010living adjustments (COLAs) that offer 100 percen t protection against infla \u0010 tion. Annuitants under the newer Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS) receive full protection only when the annual rate of inflation is less than 2 percent. If inflation in a year is between 2 percent and 3 percent, FERS annuitants receive COLAs of 2 percent. If inflation is over 3 percent, their COLA is the increase in inflation minus 1 percentage point. This option illustrates one way among many to limit COLAs for federal retirees. It would restrict COLAs for CSRS annuitants to half a percentage point below infla \u0010 tion. Moreover, when inflation was less than 3 percent, FERS retirees would receive a COLA that was 1 per \u0010 centage point below inflation. (Those two reductions would produce roughly comparable cuts in total retire \u0010 ment benefits for the two types of annuitants because FERS enrollees are also covered by Social Security.) The option would save $200 million in direct spending for civilian pensions in 2004 and $4.1 billion during the 2004\u00102008 period. Over five ye ars, the av erage CSRS retiree would lose $1,900. (The Congress could also con \u0010 sider limiting COLAs only for the FERS plan, which is more generous when Social Security and Thrift Savings Plan benefits ar e factored in.)Advocates of this option contend that federal pension plans offer greater protection through COLAs than most private pension plans do. COLAs are becoming less pre \u0010 valent in the priv ate sector. Accordin g to a 1999 survey, fewer than 10 percent of private \u0010sector retirement plans offered annuitants any automatic protection against infla \u0010 tion. Opponents of this option argue that cutting any retire \u0010 ment benefit hurts both retirees and the government's ability to recruit a high \u0010quality workforce. Further, when workers accept employment with the federal government, they count on the benefits promised. Federal workers may be accepting salaries below private \u0010sector rates for comparable jobs in exchange for better retirement provi \u0010 sions. (In essence, workers pay for their more \u0010generous retirement benefits by accepting lower wages during their working years.) This option would hurt those retirees\u2014 CSRS annuitants\u2014who are most dependent on their pensions. It would also renege on an understanding that workers covered under CSRS who passed up the chance to switch to FERS would retain their full protection against inflation. Finally, opponents note that federal retirees' protection against inflation has already been re \u0010 stricted to some extent. The General Accounting Office calculated that delays and reductions in COLAs between 1985 and 1994 effectively redu ced the adjustments to about 80 percent of inflation.

In 2002, outlays for be nefits under the two pro \u0010 grams totaled $48.9 billion. This option would use a four \u0010year average to compute benefits for people who retire under FERS and CSRS after September 30, 20 03. As a result, initial pensions would be about 1.5 percent to 2 percent sm aller for most new civilian retirees, saving the federal government $70 million in 2004 and a total of $915 million over five years. Proponents contend that this option would align federal practices more closely with those in the private sector, which commonly uses five \u0010year averages to calculate an employee's base pension. The change in formula would encourage some federal employees to work longer in order to boost their pensions to reflect the higher salaries they receive with more year s on the job. That incentivecould help the government keep experienced people, but it could hinder efforts to decrease the size of the federal workforce and promote the hiring of entry \u0010level workers. Opponents argue that by cutting benefits, this option would reduce the attractiveness of the government's civil \u0010 ian compensation package. In previous legislative ses \u0010 sions, the Congress took several actions to improve that compensation package, including rolling back required contributions by federal employees to their retirement plans. Under this option, FERS benefits (which include Social Security and the Thrift Savings Plan) would remain more generous than those offered by large private firms, but CSRS benefits (which do not include Social Security and the Thrift Savings Plan) would fall below those received by many retirees from the private sector. The average new CSRS retiree would lose $620 in 2004 and $3,200 over five years, whereas the average new FERS retiree would lose $190 in 2004 and just $1,000 over five years because of the smaller defined benefit under that system.

(That limit will increase over the next several years.) At the same time, federal agencies automatically contribute an amount equal to 1 percent of salaries for their FERS employees to the TSP. In addi \u0010 tion, they match the first 3 percent of workers' voluntary contributions to the TSP dollar for dollar and the next 2 percent at 50 cents on the dollar. Employees can con \u0010 tribute another 8 percent of pay but get no matching contribution. Thus, although federal workers can save up to 13 percent of their earnings in the TSP, they can re \u0010 ceive the maximum government match by contributing just 5 percent of their earnings. This option would restructure the TSP contribution schedule so that the government made the full 5 percent match only when employees contributed 10 percent. Specifically, the government would match voluntary con \u0010 tributions ranging from 1 percent to 6 percent of earn \u0010 ings at the rate of 50 cents per dollar (for a maximum 3 percent match) and contri butions ranging from 7 per \u0010 cent to 10 percent at 25 cent s per dollar (for a maximum 1 percent match). The government would continue to automatically contribute an amount equal to 1 percent of employees' earnings. That restructuring would save $375 million in 2004 and $2.2 billion over the 2004 \u0010 2008 period. Supporters of this option contend that changing the gov \u0010 ernment's matching schedule would bring federal prac \u0010tices more in line with those of defined \u0010contribution plans in the private sector, which usually provide lower matches and no automatic contributions. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the most prevalent practice among medium and large private firms is to match em \u0010 ployees' contributions up to 6 percent of pay at 50 cents on the dollar. Some federal employees, especially those currently contributing 5 percent of their earnings, would have an incentive to contribute more to the TSP and, as a result, would have more savings available when they re \u0010 tired. Furthermore, restructuring matching contributions might reduce the disparity between the government's two major retirement systems. Benefits under FERS\u2014which include Social Security and the TSP\u2014are currently higher and cost the governm ent m ore than benefits under the older Civil Service Retirement System for most par \u0010 ticipants. Opponents argue that this option would have several drawbacks. First, a lower government match on smaller contributions could reduce the retirement resources of some employees by weakening their incentive to con \u0010 tribute. Second, the government might achieve its savings at the expense of those employees who are least likely to contribute a higher percentage of their earnings to the TSP\u2014namely, young workers and others with relatively low pay. Third, changing the TSP could be considered unfair because many people accepted employment with the government or switched from the Civil Service Re \u0010 tirement System to FERS assuming that TSP benefits would remain the same.

The amount of compensation is based on a rating of an individual's impairment that is intended to reflect the re \u0010 sulting reduction, on average, in earnings capacity. Veter \u0010 ans' disability ratings range from zero to 100 percent (the most severe). Veterans who are unable to maintain gain \u0010 ful employment and who have ratings of at least 60 per \u0010 cent are eligible to be paid at the 100 percent rate. Veter \u0010 ans who have disabilities rated 30 percent or higher and who have dependent spouses, children, or parents are paid special allowances because of their dependents. Each year, about 45,000 more veterans with disability ratings below 30 percent be gin receiving compensation of $70 to $200 per month. This option would, for all future cases, narrow the eligibility for compensation to include only veterans with disability ratings equal to 30 percent or greater. That change would reduce federal out \u0010 lays by $953 million over the 2004 \u00102008 period.By not awarding new compensation to veterans with dis \u0010 ability ratings below 30 perc ent, VA could concentrate spending on the most impaired veterans. Furthermore, the need for compensating the least impaired veterans may be lessening. Performance in civilian jobs depends less now on physical labor than it did when the disability ratings were originally determined, and improved recon \u0010 structive techniques are now available. So physical im \u0010 pairments rated below 30 percent may not substantively reduce veterans' earnings. Examples of low \u0010rated impair \u0010 ments include conditions such as mild arthritis, moder \u0010 ately flat feet, or amputation of part of a finger\u2014 conditions that would not preclude working in many occupations today. However, veterans compensation could be viewed as career or lifetime indemnity payments that the federal government owes to people who were disabled to any degree while serving in the armed forces. Moreover, some disabled veterans might find it difficult to increase their working hours or otherwise make up for the loss of ex \u0010 pected compensation payments.

Veterans need not be performing military duties when those disabilities are incurred or made worse for the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to consider them service\u0010connected; for example, disabilities incurred while military personnel are on leave qualify. The federal gov \u0010 ernment also gives dependency and indemnity com \u0010 pensation awards to survivors when compensable disabili \u0010 ties cause or are related to a veteran's death. According to data collect ed by VA, about 290,000 vet \u0010 erans received a total of approximately $970 million in compensation payments in 2002 for disabilities that, ac \u0010 cording to the General Accounting Office, are generally neither caused nor aggravated by military service. Those diseases (excluding diabetes mellitus, which VA has since determined to be service \u0010connected for certain veterans) are:#Osteoarthritis, #Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (including chronic bronchitis and heart disease, #Crohn's disease, #Hemorrhoids, #Uterine fibroids, and #Multiple sclerosis. Ending new compensation benefits for veterans with only those seven diseases would save $18 milli on in outlays in 2004 and $449 million over the 2004 \u00102008 period. Eli \u0010 minating new compensation benefits for veterans whose compensable disabilities are also unrelated to military service would create significantly larger savings.

That care is rationed primarily on the basis of the nature of a dis \u0010 ability and income. Under certain conditions, a veteran may receive care at VA's expense in state \u0010operated or pri \u0010 vately run nursing facilities. VA can charge copayments to veterans with no com \u0010 pensable service \u0010connected disabilities and high enough income when they receive mo re than 21 days of care in VA\u0010run nursing homes. In 2003, VA may collect up to $50 million from prov iding such extended \u0010care services, including nursing home care, the Congressional Budget Office estimates. VA can spend those collections, which are outside of the appropriation process. According to the General Accounting Office, state \u0010operated nursing facili \u0010 ties for veterans and community long \u0010term care facilities that treat veterans charge co payments that offset a larger share of their operating expenses than VA does. Those facilities recover as much as 43 percent through copay \u0010 ments. (Estate \u0010recovery programs are another way that they offset costs.) This option would authorize VA to revise its cost \u0010sharing policies to recover more of the costs of providing care in VA nursing facilities. The department would be required to collect a minimum of 10 percent of its operating costs,but it could determine what type of copayments to charge and who would pay them. For example, it could apply the copayment to a broader category of veterans or re \u0010 quire veterans who make copayments to pay more. Re \u0010 covering 10 percent of VA's operating costs would save $214 million in 2004 and about $1.1 billion over five years. Achieving those savings would require depositing the receipts in the Treasury rather than allowing VA to spend them. Proponents of this option would argue that veterans in VA nursing facilities are getting a far more generous benefit than similar veterans in non \u0010VA facilities. Recov \u0010 ering more of the expense at VA facilities would make that benefit more equitable among veterans and different sites of care. Opponents of this option would argue that beneficiaries in nursing facilities might be less able to make copay \u0010 ments than beneficiaries receiving other types of care. They would also argue that a policy allowing VA to charge veterans with service \u0010connected disabilities would be inconsistent with the standard reflected by other medi \u0010 cal benefits that those veterans received. In implementing this option, VA could continue to exempt those veterans, but it would have to charge high \u0010income veterans without service\u0010connected disabilities even more to achieve the 10 percent recovery level.

Those hospitals remain open, however, because political consensus is lacking to close or realign excess facilities. This option would establish a process for VA similar to the base realignment and closure process that has been used successfully to close nonessential facilities of the Department of Defense (DoD). The Veterans Health Administration is reassessing its needs for facilities through the Capital Asset Realignment for Enhanced Services (CARES) program. That program examines who uses and who is projected to use VA facili \u0010 ties, defines market areas for serving those populations, and seeks to ensure an adequate supply and proper loca \u0010 tion of services to meet projected demand. The program's mandate includes considering closing or merging facilities where there is excess capacity or redundancy. Largely insulated from local political pressure, a realign \u0010 ment and closure commission for VA would facilitate the work of the CARES program by helping to develop the consensus needed to close hospitals and clinics with low demand and merge facilities that are located close to \u0010 gether. The commission would also serve as arbiter among interest groups and would help clarify VA's role and priorities in serving patients.As with DoD's process, this option would entail costs in the early years in order to conduct assessments and close facilities; however, over a 10 \u0010year period, it would yield net savings of $1.6 bi llion in outlays. Proponents of this option would assert that the current distribution of VA facilities is wasteful and inefficient, costing much more than is necessary to meet the demand of a few veterans for the convenience of having a VA facility nearby. The extension in recent years of health benefits to veterans who are neither disabled nor poor has created a surge in demand for VA's health care that does not reflect a growth in the size or needs of the depart \u0010 ment's core target groups\u2014veterans disabled because of their military service and very poor veterans. The needs of those core groups might be served with a much smaller VA system, perhaps supplemented by a modest program to help pay for care from private providers when travel to a VA facility was burdensome for patients. Opponents of this option would argue that an aggressive realignment and closure program would substantially reduce benefits for many veterans, particularly those who lived near facilities that closed. Moreover, opponents would point out, although VA will reimburse travel costs in many circumstances, the time and energy required to seek care at a distant facility is beyond many needy veterans.

The amount of compensation is based on a rating of an impairment's average effect on a person's earning ability. Additional allowances are paid to veterans whose disabilities are rated 30 percent or higher and who have dependent spouses, children, or parents. Veterans with disabilities may also qualify for cash pay \u0010 ments from other sources, including workers' compensa programs \u0010 ity Income; private disability insurance; and, for veterans under 65, Social Security's Disability Insurance (DI) pro \u0010 gram. An estimated 110,000 ve terans who receive dis \u0010 ability compensation from VA also receive DI payments from the Social Security Administration. When Social Security beneficiaries are eligible for disability benefits from multiple sources, ceilings usually limit their com \u0010 bined disability be nefits from public sources to 80 per \u0010 cent of their average earnings before they were disabled. Those DI payments\u2014after any reduction, if applicable \u2014are adjusted periodically for changes in the cost of liv \u0010 ing and the average wage level nationwide. Veterans' compensation payments for disabilities, however, are notincluded and do not apply toward the limit. Neither do means\u0010tested benefits and certain benefits based on public employment. This option would limit veterans' disability compensation for individuals receiving both it and DI payments. Under the option, disability compensation would be reduced by the amount of the DI benefit. Applying that change to both current and future recipients of veterans' compensa \u0010 tion would affect an estimated 110,000 recipients in 2004, saving more than $1 bi llion that year and an estimated $6 billi on over the 2004 \u00102008 period.

This option would eliminate duplicate payment of public compensation for a single disability. However, opponents could view this option as subjecting veterans' disability benefits to a form of income testing (they are currently considered an entitlement).

Specifically, the federal gov \u0010 ernment agreed to fund the operations of the District's criminal justice, court, and correctional systems. It also assumed responsibility for paying off more than $5 bil \u0010 lion in unfunded liabilities that the city owed to several pension plans, increased the federal share of the city's Medicaid payments, and provided special borrowing authority to the District. For 1998, the Revitalization Ac t included slightly more than $200 million in assistance for the District that was not related to the obligations specifically assumed by the federal government . Such funding increased to $232 million in 1999 and then pl ummeted to $28 million in 2000; it then rose slightly , to $59 million in 2001 and $60 million in 2002. The 2002 amount included funds for tuition assistance to city residents, emergency planning, and security cost s (plus $200 million in one \u0010 time supplemental appropriations for activities related to September 11). Eliminating that general fiscal assistance to the District would sa ve $61 million in 2004 and $318 million over the 2004 \u00102008 period.Supporters of this option contend that the federal govern \u0010 ment already relieved the District of Columbia govern \u0010 ment of the cost of a substantial, and increasing, portion of its budget\u2014criminal justice, Medicaid, and pensions. The proposed trade \u0010off for assuming responsibility for those functions was ending other assistance, including the annual federal payment. Eliminating general assistance would be consistent with that policy. Opponents of this option argue that the need for funding assistance continues. The Constitution gives the Congress responsibility for overseeing the District of Columbia (which the Congress has largely delegated to the city government), and the city still has major problems with its public schools, roadways, and other essential services. Moreover, the Congress prevents the District of Colum \u0010 bia from imposing commuter taxes, as many other cities do. Such taxes are levied on nonresidents who work in a city and benefit from its services. Two of three dollars earned in the District of Columbia are earned by non \u0010 residents. Finally, opponents argue that continued assist \u0010 ance is justified because more than 40 percent of city property, including property owned by the federal gov \u0010 ernment or foreign nations, is exempt from local taxes.CHAPTER TWO FUNCTION 800: GENERAL GOVERNMENT 185 800-02\u2014Mandatory Require the Internal Revenue Service to Deposit Fees from Installment Agreements in the Treasury as Miscellaneous Receipts Total (Millions of dollars) 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2004-2008 2004-2013 Savings Budget authority 83 84 85 86 87 425 875Outlays 83 84 85 86 87 425 875 The 1996 appropriation act fo r the Department of the Treasury, the Postal Service, the Executive Office of the President, and certain independent agencies authorized the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to establish new fees and increase existing ones. Under that law, the IRS can retain and spend receipts collected from those fees, up to an annual limit of $119 milli on. The IRS has used that authority mainly to charge taxpayers a fee for entering into payment plans with the agency. In 2001, the IRS collected $80 million in fee re ceipts. Last year, however, it collected only $72 million in fees. The IRS attributes the smaller amount in 2002 to various one \u0010time events, including the terrori st attacks of Se ptember 11, the tax rebate, and improvements in its information system. Requiring the IRS to deposit those receipts in the Trea \u0010 sury would eliminate the agency's ability to spend them. That change would reduce the IRS's direct spending by $83 million in 2004 and $425 million over the 2004 \u0010 2008 period (assuming that removing the spending au \u0010 thority did not substantially reduce the amount that the IRS collected each year in such fees).Supporters of this option assert that processing payment plans with taxpayers is an administrative function directly related to the IRS's mission\u2014getting citizens to pay the taxes they owe\u2014and thus is a function for which the agency already receives annu al appropriations. (For 2003, the IRS received a total of $8.89 billion in direct appro \u0010 priations, not counting transfers.) Moreover, the IRS does not directly use the receipts it collects from fees on install \u0010 ment agreements to fund the processing of those agree \u0010 ments. Proponents also contend that the agency's spend \u0010 ing authority could create an incentive for the IRS to unnecessarily encourage taxpayers to pay their taxes in installments. Similarly, it could encourage the agency to seek new and unnecessary fees. Opponents of this option argue that allowing the IRS to generate and use fee receipts helps ensure that the federal government's main revenue collector has sufficient fund \u0010 ing to fulfill its mission. Some critics would argue that even an annual decrease of roughly $80 million in fund \u0010 ing could negatively affect revenue collection. In addi \u0010 tion, eliminating the spending authority could reduce the IRS's incentive to allow installment payments or its ability to provide for them, thus hurting taxpayers who would benefit from such arrangements.186 BUDGET OPTIONS 800-03\u2014Discretionary Eliminate Federal Antidrug Advertising Total (Millions of dollars) 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2004-2008 2004-2013 Savings Budget authority 183 187 191 195 199 955 2,016Outlays 55 148 187 191 195 776 1,817 Funds provided to the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) can be used to test advertising, pur \u0010 chase media time, and evalua te the effects of national antidrug media campaigns. The agency is required to solicit donations from nonfederal sources to pay part of its costs. For 2002, the appropriation ac t for the Treasury Depart \u0010 ment, the Postal Service, the Executive Office of the President, and certain independent agencies provided $180 million for the antidr ug media program. Elimi \u0010 nating that program would save $55 million in outlays in 2004 and $776 million over the 2004 \u00102008 period. Proponents of this option argue that there is no solid empirical evidence that media campaigns are effective in either preventing or reducing the use of illegal drugs.Some analysts claim that me dia spots do not reduce drug use by minors as effectively as treatment or interdiction do. Furthermore, since nonprofit organizations, such as the Partnership for a Drug \u0010Free America, al ready conduct educational programs about the dangers of drug use, ONDCP's campaign may duplicate private or local ef \u0010 forts. Opponents of this option argue that educating young people about the hazards of illegal drug use is a national responsibility. Some point to the \"Just Say No\" campaign begun by former First Lady Nancy Reagan in the 1980s as an example of the successful use of the national media to raise young people's awareness of the dangers of drugs. They also argue that the cost of drug abuse to the country is so high that it is worthwhile to maintain a program that reduces drug use even slightly.920 Allowances The President's budget and the Congressi onal budget resolution som etimes include amounts in function 920 to reflect proposals that are not clearly specified or that would affect multiple budget functions. Since the Congress actually appro \u0010 priates money for specific purpose s, there are no budget author ity or outlay totals for func tion 920 in historical data. In this volume, function 920 includes option s that cut across programs and agencies and would affect multiple budget func \u0010 tions.188 BUDGET OPTIONS 920-01\u2014Mandatory Charge Federal Employees Commercial Rates for Parking Total (Millions of dollars) 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2004-2008 2004-2013 Added Receipts 140 140 140 150 150 720 1,540 The federal government owns or leases more than 200,000 parking spaces, which it allocates to its employ \u0010 ees\u2014in most cases at no charge. Requiring federal gov \u0010 ernment employees to pay commercial rates for their parking could yiel d receipts of $140 mi llion in 2004 and $720 million over five years. Federal workers in the largest metropolitan areas would bear most of the new charges. Those in the Washington, D.C., area would pay abou t 75 percent of the total charge. (Federal employees in less commercially devel \u0010 oped areas, where charging for parking is uncommon, would not face new parking fees.) Employees who con \u0010 tinued to use federally owned or managed parking would, on average, pay about $130 per month; employees who currently use free or heavily subsidized parking could choose alternative means of transportation, such as public transit or carpooling, to avoid the charge. Supporters of this option favor charging commercial rates for parking because it would encourage federal employees to use public transportation or to carpool. That shift would reduce the flow of cars into urban areas, cutting down on energy consumption, air pollution, and conges \u0010tion. In addition, commercial pricing would indicate the demand for parking by federal workers more accurately, enabling the government to allocate spaces to those who valued them the most. Moreover, if commercial rates re \u0010 duced the demand for spaces sufficiently, the government might be able to put the unused spaces to new, higher \u0010 valued uses. Finally, some supporters argue that the fed \u0010 eral government should not provide a valuable com \u0010 modity, such as parking, free to workers who could afford to pay for it. Opponents of this option argue that by charging for parking, the government would unfairly penalize workers in urban areas who have difficulty obtaining access to al \u0010 ternative transportation or who drive to work for valid personal reasons. Charging for parking would also reduce federal employees' total compensation. In addition, oppo \u0010 nents note that many private \u0010sector employers provide free parking. Some people have also argued that charging commercial rates would merely redistribute the existing parking spaces without reducing the number of people who drive to work. According to that view, the spaces would simply be allocated by willingness to pay rather than by rank, seniority, or other factors. RELATED CBO PUBLICATION :Comparing Federal Employee Benefits with Those in the Private Sector , August 1998CHAPTER TWO FUNCTION 920: ALLOWANCES 189 920-02\u2014Discretionary Raise the Threshold for Coverage Under the Davis-Bacon Act Total (Millions of dollars) 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2004-2008 2004-2013 Savings Budget authority 130 135 140 140 145 690 1,465Outlays 50 125 170 195 210 750 1,900 Since 1935, the Davis \u0010Bacon Act has required that \"pre \u0010 vailing wages\" be paid on a ll federally funded or federally assisted constructi on projects with contracts of $2,000 or more. The Department of Labor measures prevailing wages in an area according to the specific wages and benefits earned by at least 50 percent of workers in a par \u0010 ticular type of job or the average of the wages and benefits paid to workers in that type of job. Those procedures, as well as the classifications of workers who receive pre \u0010 vailing wages, favor union wage rates in some cases. In recent years, several bills have been introduced in the Congress that would raise the threshold for determining which projects are covered by the Davis \u0010Bacon Act. This option would increase the threshold from $2,000 to $1 million. That change woul d save $50 million in dis \u0010 cretionary outlays in 2004 and $750 million over the 2004\u00102008 period\u2014provided that federal agencies' ap \u0010 propriations were lowered to reflect the anticipated re \u0010 duction in costs. (The higher threshold would also save$1 million in mandatory spending in 2004 and $10 mil \u0010 lion over the five \u0010year period.) In addition, it would re \u0010 duce firms' and the government's administrative burden by restricting coverage to the largest contracts. Supporters of this option argue that the threshold has remained the same for more than 65 years and that rais \u0010 ing it would allow the federal government to spend less on construction. Moreover, this option could potentially increase the opportunities for employment that federal projects would offer to less \u0010skilled workers. Opponents of such a change note that it would lower the earnings of some construction workers. In addition, op \u0010 ponents argue that raising the threshold could jeopardize the quality of federally funded or federally assisted con \u0010 struction projects. They contend that since firms are re \u0010 quired to pay at least the locally prevailing wage, firms are more likely to hire able workers, resulting in fewer de \u0010 fects in the finished projects and more timely completion.190 BUDGET OPTIONS 920-03\u2014Mandatory Impose a Fee on the Investment Portfolios of Government-Sponsored Enterprises Total (Millions of dollars) 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2004-2008 2004-2013 Added \u0010sponsored enterprises (GSEs) are private financial institutions chartered by the federal government to promote the flow of credit to targeted uses, primarily housing and agriculture. GSEs achieve their public pur \u0010 pose by raising funds in the capital markets on the strength of an implied fede ral guarantee and lending or otherwise conveying monies to retail lenders. Investors infer a federal guarantee of GSE obligations from provi \u0010 sions in the GSEs' charters, such as those that exempt the enterprises from state and local income taxes, render GSE securities eligible to serve as collateral for federal and other public deposits, and authorize the Secretary of the Treasury to purchase debt securities issued by the enter \u0010 prises. The implicit federal guarantee\u2014for which the fed \u0010 eral government now collects no fee\u2014lowers the cost of borrowing for the GSEs and conveys a subsidy that gives them a competitive advantage in financial markets. Four GSEs\u2014Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, Farmer Mac, and the Federal Home Loan Banks\u2014have used their priv \u0010 ileged borrowing to acquire and hold large portfolios of securities. Those investments consist mostly of mortgage \u0010 backed securities but also include other asset \u0010backed secu \u0010 rities, corporate bonds, and mortgage revenue bonds. At the end of 2002, the investment portfolios of those four enterprises totaled $2 trillion , or 75 percent of their com \u0010 bined assets. The GSEs earn profits from the difference in yields on their investments and on their subsidizeddebt issues. Those profits, which owe much to the federal guarantee, accrue to shareh olders and other GSE stake \u0010 holders. This option would impose a fee of 10 basis points (10 cents per $100 of in vestments) on GSEs' investment portfolios. That change would provide the federal govern \u0010 ment with nearly $1.5 billion in added re ceipts in 2004 and $8.2 billion over five year s. Those proceeds from the fee would equal about one \u0010third of the federal subsidy estimated to be retained by equity investors and other stakeholders of the housing GSEs. Proponents of imposing the fee could argue that doing so would promote competition in financial markets and recover some of the federal subsidy retained by the GSEs without reducing their capacity to achieve their public mission. For example, the fee would not restrict the hous \u0010 ing GSEs' authority to guarantee mortgage \u0010backed securities or prevent them from purchasing those secu \u0010 rities, nor would it hamper the ability of the Home Loan Banks to make advances to members. Opponents of this option might argue that the GSEs either do not receive a government subsidy or that they pass all of it through to targeted borrowers and, hence, should not be subject to a fee.

Eliminating that \"cargo preference\" would lower federal transportation costs by allowing the government to ship its cargo at the lowest available rates \u2014saving $243 million in ou tlays in 2004 and nearly $2 billion over five years. Two federal agencies\u2014the Department of Defense (DoD) and the Department of Agriculture (USDA)\u2014 account for about 90 percent (by weight) of the govern \u0010 ment shipments subject to cargo preference laws. The preference applies to nearly all of DoD's freight and three\u0010quarters of USDA's shipments of food aid, as well as shipments associated with programs of the Agency for International Development and the Export \u0010Import Bank. Roughly 66 percent of the savings from eliminating cargo preference would come from defense discretionary spend \u0010 ing, with the other 34 percent from nondefense discre \u0010 tionary spending. Supporters of this option contend that cargo preference represents a subsidy of private vessels by taxpayers, which helps a handful of carriers preserve their market share and market power. Proponents also point out that DoD offi \u0010 cials question the national security importance of the cargo preferences. DoD has invested in a fleet of its ownspecifically for transporting military equipment. It also contracts with foreign \u0010flag ships when needed. In addi \u0010 tion, this option's advocates argue that the U.S. govern \u0010 ment is at a competitive disadvantage in selling surplus agricultural commodities abroad because it must pay higher costs to transport them. Opponents of this option argue that cargo preference promotes the economic viability of the nation's maritime industry. That industry has suffered from foreign compe \u0010 tition in recent decades. Under federal law, U.S. m ariners must crew U.S. vessels, and in general, U.S. shipyards must build them. Because U.S. \u0010flag ships face higher labor costs and greater regulatory responsibilities than foreign\u0010flag ships, they generally charge higher rates. Without guaranteed business from cargo preference, opponents contend, many U.S. \u0010flag vessels engaged in international trade would leave the fleet. They would do so either by reflagging in a foreign country to save money or by decommissioning if they could not operate compe \u0010 titively. This option's opponents also argue that cargo preference helps bolster national security by ensuring that U.S.\u0010flag vessels and U.S. crews are available during war \u0010 time. Finally, eliminating cargo preference could cause U.S. ship operators and shipbuilders to default on loans guaranteed by the government. (The possibility of such defaults is not reflected in the estimated savings from this option.)3 Options That Affect RevenuesCHAPTERCHAPTER THREE OPTIONS THAT AFFECT REVENUES 195 Revenue Option 1 Combine the Personal Exempti on and the Standard Deduction Total (Billions of dollars) 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2004-2008 2004-2013 Added Revenues Taxpayer only 11.4 27.2 24.0 21.4 20.3 104.3 233.7Taxpayer and spouse 15.7 37.5 33.1 29.7 28.3 144.3 328.7 Source: Joint Committee on Taxation. To compute their taxable income under current law, tax \u0010 payers subtract personal exemptions and either the stan \u0010 dard deduction or itemized deductions from their ad \u0010 justed gross income (AGI). The law allows personal exemptions for the taxpayer, his or her spouse, and any dependents. In 2002, each pe rsonal exemption that a taxpayer claimed re duced AGI by $3,000. High \u0010income taxpayers are treated differently, however; for them, the value of personal exemptions phases out above certain income thresholds. Taxpayers may further reduce their AGI by claiming either the standard deduction or certain itemized deduc \u0010 tions. In 2002, the standard deduction was $4,700 for single taxpayers and $7,850 fo r married taxpayers filing jointly. Itemized deductions are specific expenses that tax \u0010 payers are allowed to subtract from their income; they in \u0010 clude contributions to charities, home mortgage interest, state and local income and pr operty taxes, and certain medical expenses. Again, above certain income thres \u0010 holds, the law reduces the value of itemized deductions for high\u0010income taxpayers. In 1999, roughly two \u0010thirds of tax returns (86 million) claimed the standard deduc \u0010 tion, and the remaining 40 million claimed itemized de \u0010 ductions. This option would combine the personal exemption for the primary taxpayer with the standard deduction to yield a higher standard deduction. A corollary option would add the personal exemption for the taxpayer's spouse to that combination to provide a higher standard deduction for married couples filing a joint return. Combining the primary personal exemption with the standard deduction would increase revenues by $104.3 billion over the 2004\u0010 2008 period; if the spousal exemption was included, reve \u0010nues would increase by $144.3 billion over the five \u0010year span. Under this option, the tax liability of some people would rise, but most taxpayers' liability would be unaffected. Taxpayers who currently claim the standard deduction would see no change in their taxes. However, taxpayers who currently itemize but have itemized deductions that are less than the value of the combined personal exemp \u0010 tion and standard deduction would choose to claim the combined standard deduction; as a result, their taxable income would rise by the amount that their itemized de \u0010 ductions exceeded the current standard deduction. Tax \u0010 payers who itemize and have itemized deductions above the combined value of the personal exemption and stan \u0010 dard deduction would still choose to itemize, but they would see their taxable income increase by the amount of the personal exemption. High \u0010income taxpayers who could not claim personal exemptions because of their in \u0010 come level would see no change in their tax liability. By eliminating the primary personal exemption, the op \u0010 tion would shift 9 million taxpayers from claiming itemized deductions to clai ming the standard deduction; eliminating the personal exemption for a spouse would move an additional 5 million. Those taxpayers would no longer have to keep detailed records to justify their item \u0010 ized deductions, which would lessen the complexity of the tax system. Proponents of this alternative might also argue that it would increase economic efficiency, since taxpayers who no longer itemized would not receive tax \u0010 favored treatment that lowered the after \u0010tax price of se \u0010 lected goods, such as mortgage \u0010financed, owner \u0010occupied housing.196 BUDGET OPTIONS Opponents of this option would argue that the activities reflected in itemized deductions serve important purposes and should continue to be favorably treated under tax law. Some of those deductions are designed to encourage activities with social benefits , such as charitable giving, and a reduction in tax incentives for those activities, say opponents, would lead to less of them. Other itemizeddeductions, such as those for health expenses, casualty losses, and employee business expenses, are allowed be \u0010 cause they lower a taxpayer's disposable income; de \u0010 ducting them more accurately measures a person's ability to pay income tax. Eliminating the tax reductions associ \u0010 ated with those expenses for taxpayers who no longer itemize would create a less equitable tax system.CHAPTER THREE OPTIONS THAT AFFECT REVENUES 197 Revenue Option 2 Eliminate the Deductibility of Interest on Home-Equity Debt Total (Billions of dollars) 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2004-2008 2004-2013 Added Revenues 0.4 0.5 0.5 0.5 0.5 2.4 5.7 Source: Joint Committee on Taxation. The amount of mortgage interest that can be deducted from adjusted gross income is limited to the interest on up to $1 million of acquisition indebtedness and $100,000 of home \u0010equity debt. (The li mits do not apply to mortgages taken out be fore October 14, 1987.) As de \u0010 fined in the tax code, acquisition indebtedness is a mort \u0010 gage that is used to buy, build, or substantially improve a primary residence or a second home. Home \u0010equity debt is all other debt that is mortgaged against such homes. Eliminating the deductibility of interest on home \u0010equity debt would raise $0.4 billion in revenues in 2004 and a total of $2.4 billion from 2004 through 2008. Home\u0010equity debt can arise either from taking out a home\u0010equity loan or from refinancing an existing mort \u0010 gage with a larger one. If a homeowner takes out a home \u0010 equity loan for more than he or she spends on home im \u0010 provements at that time, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) considers the excess loan to be home \u0010equity debt. Similarly, if a homeowner refinances at a higher loan amount than the outstanding balance on his or her ori \u0010 ginal loan, and spends less than the increase on home im \u0010 provements, the IRS considers the excess to be home \u0010 equity debt. Home\u0010equity loans and refinancing have become com \u0010 mon, but the IRS would not classify all of that borrowing as home\u0010equity debt. In the late 1990s, 13 percent of homeowners had home \u0010equity loans and 16 percent of homeowners with mortgages had cashed out some of their equity when they refinanced. Most loans and cash \u0010 outs were well below the $100,000 limit; only about one \u0010 fourth of either type was for $25,000 or more. Both types of borrowing are commonly used to pay for home im \u0010 provements\u2014and to that extent qualify as acquisition in \u0010 debtedness\u2014but they are also used to pay off other debts, to invest in businesses or real estate, and to finance house \u0010hold spending for automobiles, medical expenses, educa \u0010 tion, and vacations. In general, taxpayers may not deduct from adjusted gross income so \u0010called personal interest\u2014that is, interest on credit card debt, car loans, and personal loans. An ex \u0010 ception is made for home mortgages because of the pub \u0010 lic benefits that are believed to result from home owner \u0010 ship\u2014for example, greater involvement in the com \u0010 munity and better home maintenance. Allowing a de \u0010 duction for interest on home \u0010equity debt results in cer \u0010 tain homeowners being able to circumvent the ban on deducting personal interest. Homeowners who itemize and who have sufficient equity in their homes can take out a home \u0010equity loan to pay off credit card debt, buy a car, or cover other personal expenses. Renters and homeowners who do not have sufficient equity or do not itemize cannot circumvent the personal interest ban. That differential treatment is not only inequitable but also encourages greater indebtedness on the part of taxpayers who are allowed to skirt the restriction on deducting per \u0010 sonal interest. Ending the deductibility of interest on home\u0010equity debt would still leave substantial tax incen \u0010 tives to encourage home ownership. Such inducements include the continued deductibility of debt to buy, build, or improve a home; the absence of taxation on the value of the housing services that owners provide to themselves; and the exclusion from taxation of most capital gains realized on home sales. The option has several drawbacks, however, that argue against its adoption. One is that it would subject many more homeowners to complex recordkeeping and tax \u0010 filing requirements. Today, only the relatively few owners who borrow more than $100,000 of home \u0010equity debt must keep track of the proportion whose interest is de \u0010 ductible. But under this option, most owners who took198 BUDGET OPTIONS out home\u0010equity loans or cashed out some of their equity when they refinanced would have to make those calcu \u0010 lations. A related drawback would be the cost of enforcing the option. Currently, the IR S enforces the $100,000 limit on home\u0010equity debt primarily through audits, very few of which are conducted for that purpose. Few taxpayers violate the limit, so noncompliance is not a major prob \u0010 lem. But under this option, enforcement would become more important because many more homeowners would be subject to a ban on deducting interest from home \u0010 equity debt. Furthermore, enforcement on a larger scale would require lenders to report more information than they do now and homeowners to provide documentation of their home \u0010improvement expenses. (However, any substantial increase in enforcement by the IRS would bring in additional revenues beyond the estimates above, which were based on current levels of enforcement.) Also of potential concern is that this option would treat owners who moved more favorably than owners who stayed put. Movers can borrow against their homes forother purposes by taking out a larger mortgage than they need to pay off the old mortgage and finance any increase in the price of the new home. The IRS considers all of that debt to be acquisition debt as long as the new mort \u0010 gage is smaller than the price of the new home. Thus, an owner who did not move would gradually pay down his or her mortgage and not be able to deduct interest on borrowing to buy, say, a new car. But an owner who moved to a similarly priced house would be able to take out a mortgage equal to the debt on the old house plus the cost of the car. The mover could then use the extra money from the loan to pay for the car and deduct all of the interest payments. Favoring owners who move not only seems inequitable but also encourages owners to relocate and therefore probably lessens their interest in becoming involved in their communities. In that way, the option undermines one of the primary purposes of allowing the mortgage interest deduction. The option also encourages home \u0010 owners to take out larger mortgages when they m ove than they otherwise would, which increases their chances of losing their home in the future.CHAPTER THREE OPTIONS THAT AFFECT REVENUES 199 Revenue Option 3 Eliminate Deferred Taxation of Like-Kind Exchanges Total (Billions of dollars) 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2004-2008 2004-2013 Added Revenues 0.2 1.2 1.2 1.3 1.3 5.2 12.6 Source: Joint Committee on Taxation. The tax code requires people who sell or exchange capital assets to report any capital gain or loss as part of their taxable income. An exception is exchanges of certain similar assets, mainly real estate. The law recognizes no gain or loss if property held for productive use in a trade or business or for investment is exchanged for property of a \"like kind\" that is to be held for the same reasons. In those exchanges, people carry over to the new property any gain that has accrued on the old asset, and they do not pay tax on that gain until the new property is sold. Like\u0010kind real estate assets are broadly defined as any properties located in the United States. In some exchanges, two owners swap like \u0010kind property, but in many instances, a single owner sells one property to a second party and purchases a replacement property from a third. For those transactions to qualify as like \u0010kind exchanges, the pro \u0010 ceeds from the sale of the original property must be held outside the seller's control\u2014for example, by a qualified intermediary\u2014 and used to purchase the replacement property. In addition, the like\u0010kind replacement property must be identified within 45 days of the sale and purchased within 180 days. By deferring taxation, the tax code treats capital gains from like \u0010 kind exchanges more favorably than gains that are made in trading many other assets. Any gain realized from selling one stock to purchase another, for example, or from selling a share in one partnership to purchase a share in another is taxable in the year of the exchange. Gains from trades of bonds, mort \u0010 gages, and other debt instruments are similarly taxed. This op \u0010 tion would eliminate the deferral for like \u0010kind exchanges, mak \u0010 ing the tax system more equitable. That change would raise $0.2 billion in revenues in 2004 and a total of $5.2 billion from 2004 to 2008. An argument that is sometimes used to justify the current treat \u0010 ment of like \u0010kind exchanges is that the new property is a con \u0010tinuation of the same investment as the previous one and no tax should be levied until the owner leaves that line of investing. Also, it is argued, when owners simply swap property, without cash changing hands, no money becomes available for paying the tax. Furthermore, allowing like \u0010kind exchanges helps prop \u0010 erty owners respond more easily to changing conditions in their lives or in property markets. But, as proponents of this option contend, those justifications apply as well to many exchanges of stocks, bonds, and partnership shares and therefore do not support treating real estate and certain other exchanges differ \u0010 ently from exchanges of assets such as stocks and bonds. One reason for either continuing the current treatment of like \u0010 kind exchanges or phasing it out slowly is that many investors purchased property with the understanding that they would be able to exchange it for other property without paying capital gains taxes. Changing the tax treatment abruptly would impose hardships on some investors and could depress property prices. Another reason for continuing the current treatment is that like\u0010kind exchanges are not the only such transactions on which gains taxes are deferred: the tax code permits deferral on swaps of corporate equities in business mergers as well as on exchanges involving property that is condemned, destroyed, or stolen\u2014 known as involuntary conversions. As that term suggests, how \u0010 ever, such transactions differ from like \u0010kind exchanges by being largely beyond the property owner's control. In the past, the Congress has considered limiting the amount of the gain that owners can defer under like \u0010kind exchanges of real property. Proposals have also been made to defer gains only on exchanges of properties that are related or similar in service or use. Although that stricter standard already applies to gains on certain involuntary conversions, applying it on a broader scale would present problems in administration because of the extensive effort required to determine whether assets are similar in service or use.

Under current law, taxpayers who itemize deductions may deduct the value of contributions they make to qualifying charitable organizations up to a maximum of 50 percent of their adjusted gross income in any year. Through that deduction, the federal government provides a significant incentive to support philanthropic activities. In addition to donating ca sh, taxpayers may contribute assets such as stocks or works of art. Taxpayers who con \u0010 tribute property that has appreciated in value receive spe \u0010 cial treatment under the tax code. As a general rule, if the taxpayer has held the property for more than 12 months, he or she may deduct its fair market value at the time of the gift\u2014regardless of its original price. This option would limit the deduction for appreciated property to its tax basis\u2014the initial cost of the asset plusthe cost of any subsequent improvements and minus any deductions for depreciation. That change would increase revenues by about $0.4 billi on in 2004 and more than $8.4 billion over five years. The existing provision allows taxpayers to deduct the en \u0010 tire value of assets that they contribute to charities even though they have paid no tax on gains from the assets' appreciation. That arrangement treats the donation of appreciated assets more adva ntageously than other types of donations\u2014for example, cash\u2014and expands the pre \u0010 ferential treatment of capital gains in the tax code (see Revenue Option 3). The current provision also encour \u0010 ages people to donate appreciated assets to eligible chari \u0010 ties during their lifetime rather than leave them to their heirs at death.

Note: * = less than $50 million. Policymakers added the earned income tax credit (EITC) to the tax code in 1975 to supplement the wages of low \u0010 income families. Originally, the law applied only to families with one or more children. Ho wever, in 1994, the program was expanded to include a small credit for low\u0010income individuals with no children. This option would eliminate the childless EITC, lessening the tax code's complexity and raising $3 billion in revenues over the 2004\u00102008 period. For 2004, the tax credit is sche duled to phase in at a rate of 7.65 percent\u2014the payroll ta x rate for employees\u2014over the first $5,110 of income, yi elding a maximum credit of $391. (As an example, a qu alifying individual with earnings of $2,000 would rece ive a credit of $153.) It then phases out at the same rate for earnings above spe \u0010 cified thresholds\u2014$7,150 fo r married couples filing jointly and $6,150 for all others . The phaseout range for the childless EITC begins at less than half the income threshold for families with children, which limits thenumber of people who are el igible for the credit. In 1999, 3.2 million taxpayers receiv ed credits averaging $200. Fewer than 400,000 people received the full credit. About 1.2 million recipients had income within the phase \u0010in range, and roughly 1.6 milli on were in the phaseout range. Proponents of this option might point out that in addi \u0010 tion to raising revenues, it would eliminate a program that provided little benefit but posed a substantial admin \u0010 istrative burden. The paperwork for the EITC is compli \u0010 cated, and almost every person eligible for the childless credit would not have to file a tax return if he or she were not claiming the credit. Opponents of the option might contend that the credit, though small, provides some assistance to low \u0010income workers. Eliminating the program would reduce govern \u0010 ment assistance to society's most financially needy indi \u0010 viduals. 202 BUDGET OPTIONS Revenue Option 6 Include Social Security Benefits in Calculating the Phaseout of the Earned Income Tax Credit Total (Billions of dollars) 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2004-2008 2004-2013 Added Revenuesa* 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.8 1.6 Source: Joint Committee on Taxation. Note: * = less than $50 million. a. Includes outlay savings. Under current law, the earned income tax credit (EITC) phases out as the larger of earned income or adjusted gross income (AGI) exceeds a certain threshold. However, AGI excludes most income from government transfer programs such as Social Se curity, and as a result, low \u0010 income families that receive sizable transfers can claim the EITC with the same total income that will reduce or deny the credit to otherwise comparable families whose income is fully included in their AGI. The tax code already requires some Social Security benefits to be counted: for single taxpay ers with income above $25,000 and joint filers with income above $32,000, AGI includes up to 85 percent of any Social Security benefits. This op \u0010 tion would require taxpayers to include all Social Security benefits in a modified AGI that would be used for phas \u0010 ing out the EITC. That change would increase federal revenues and decrea se outlays for the credit by $800 mil \u0010 lion over the 2004 \u00102008 period. One argument in support of this option is that it would make the EITC fairer. Counting all Social Security bene \u0010 fits in the calculation for phasing out the credit would give the same EITC to both low \u0010income taxpayers who receive Social Security and claim the credit and otherwise comparable taxpayers whose income derives entirely from sources that are fully included in their AGI. In addition, because the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) already re \u0010 ceives information on taxpayers' Social Security benefits,the administration of this option would require only minor procedural changes. But the modified AGI would still exclude some transfer income; hence, this option would not resolve the problem that families with the same total income receive different credits. The IRS does not currently collect information on most forms of taxpayers' transfer income other than Social Security. As a result, requiring taxpayers to count all such income would substa ntially expand the informa \u0010 tion reported to the IRS and markedly increase taxpayers' \"costs\" of compliance (for example, time spent filling out forms). Furthermore, because most transfer income that is not included in AGI is from means \u0010tested programs (which tie benefit eligibility to a test of need based on in \u0010 come and assets), counting all transfers in phasing out the EITC would offset, at least in part, the goal of providing support to low \u0010income recipients. Even so, excluding transfers from the income measure used to phase out the credit would treat otherwise similar taxpayers differently. Another consideration is that counting Social Security benefits for the EITC phaseout would increase the costs of compliance for Social Security recipients who claim the credit and would further complicate the already com \u0010 plex form such taxpayers must complete. Those outcomes would run counter to recent efforts to simplify proced \u0010 ures for claiming the earned income tax credit.CHAPTER THREE OPTIONS THAT AFFECT REVENUES 203 Revenue Option 7 Substitute a Tax Credit for the Exclusion of Interest Income on State and Local Debt Total (Billions of dollars) 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2004-2008 2004-2013 Added Revenues 0.3 0.6 0.9 1.3 1.6 4.7 14.5 Source: Joint Committee on Taxation. The tax code allows owners of state and local bonds to exclude the interest they earn on those bonds from their gross income and thus from income tax. As a result, state and local governments pay lower interest rates on such bonds than would be paid on bonds of comparable risk whose interest was taxable. The revenues that the federal government forgoes exceed $26 billion per year and effec- tively pay a portion of the costs that state and local gov- ernments incur when they borrow. This option would replace the exclusion of interest in- come on new issues of state and local debt with a tax credit that, unlike most credits, would be included in ad- justed gross income. Under the option, the bondholder would receive a taxable interest payment from the state or local government that issu ed the bond plus a federal tax credit that would provide the bondholder with anafter-tax return comparable wi th that provided by a tax- exempt bond. The option would retain existing restric-tions that now apply to the issuance of tax-exempt bonds. It would raise $0.3 billion in 2004 and $4.7 billion over the 2004- 2008 period. Switching to a tax credit rather than excluding interest paid on state and local debt from the gross income of bond purchasers would have several effects. It could re-duce state and local governments' borrowing costs by apercentage similar to the reduction that the exclusion provides but with a smaller loss of federal revenues. The loss would be smaller because switching to a credit would eliminate gains for bondholders in higher marginal tax brackets that exceed the investment return necessary to induce them to buy the bonds. In addition, the size of the tax credit could be varied to allow the Congress to adjust the size of the federal subsidy\u2014on the basis of the per- ceived benefit to the public \u2014for different categories of state and local borrowing. Nevertheless, substituting a taxcredit for the exclusion would keep the federal subsidy akin to an entitlement. Another effect of switching to a tax credit is that it might raise the interest rate on state and local government bor- rowing. For example, it would lower the bonds' after-tax returns for people with higher marginal tax rates and thus lead them to buy fewer bonds. If that drop in demand for bonds was not offset by increased demand from other in- vestors, state and local borrowing costs would be reduced by a smaller percentage than they currently are, and in- terest rates on state and local debt would rise. Payinghigher rates for borrowing could lead state and local gov- ernments in turn to reduce investments in capital facili- ties.204 BUDGET OPTIONS Revenue Option 8 Restrict the Tax Exclusion for Qu alified Parking to Locations from Which Employees Commute in Vans and Carpools Total (Billions of dollars) 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2004-2008 2004-2013 Added Revenues 0.7 0.8 0.8 0.8 0.8 3.9 7.9 Source: Joint Committee on Taxation. The tax code allows employees to exclude from their tax \u0010 able income the value of certain expenses for transporta \u0010 tion that are paid by their employers. Those expenses include transportation in a van or other commuter high \u0010 way vehicle, transit passes, and so \u0010called qualified park \u0010 ing. (Qualified parking can be parking at or near an em \u0010 ployer's place of business as well as parking provided at or near a place from which the employee commutes to work in a commuter highway vehicle or carpool.) The law limits the monthly amount that can be excluded from an employee's income to $100 for commuter highway vehicles and transit passes and $185 for qualified parking. In effect, the tax exclusion provides an incentive from the federal government (in the form of lower taxes) to use those means of transportation. Under this option, employees would be able to exclude only their costs for parking at sites from which they con \u0010 tinue on to work in a commuter highway vehicle or car \u0010 pool and not their costs for parking at or near their job. The option would increase revenues by $0.7 billion in 2004 and $3.9 billion over the 2004 \u00102008 period. By raising the cost of commuting by private vehicle, this option could lead workers to drive less and thereby re \u0010 duce air pollution and traffic congestion. Those outcomes might be more efficient than the current situation in which drivers do not bear the full cost of the pollution and congestion that they cause and so may drive more than is efficient. The incentive that the tax exclusion pro \u0010 vides for parking at work exacerbates that problem by further encouraging workers to drive. Moreover, because the incentive for parking exceeds the incentive for mass transit, workers who would otherwise be indifferent to which of the two modes of transportation they used will choose to commute by car. Some drivers would continue to drive to work even with \u0010 out the exclusion. For people who lack good alternatives to driving, eliminating it would be costly. Furthermore, the current incentive for mass transit may already offer an economically appropriate inducement for commuters to use public transportation rather than to drive. Finally, taxing the value of parking would increase the reporting required of employers and complicate the completion of tax returns for many workers.

Tax law excludes from taxable income the premiums that employers pay for employees' group term life insurance, but it limits that exclusion to the cost of premiums for the first $50,000 of insurance. (The exclusion is not avail \u0010 able to self \u0010employed people.) Of the fringe benefits that offer a tax advantage to their recipients, employer \u0010paid life insurance is the third most expensive in terms of lost revenues (after health insurance and pensions). If premi \u0010 ums for employer \u0010paid life insurance were included in employees' taxable income, individual income tax reve \u0010 nues would rise by $8.1 billion from 2004 through 2008, and payroll tax reve nues would increa se by $4.6 billion. Excluding life insurance premiums from taxation has ramifications for both efficiency and equity. Like the tax exclusions for other employment \u0010based fringe benefits, the exclusion for life insurance creates an incentive that induces people to purchase more life insurance than they would if they had to pay the full cost of it themselves. Furthermore, excluding premiums from taxation allows workers whose employers purchase life insurance for them to pay less tax than workers who have the same total compensation but must purchase insurance on their own.Those factors, which some people might view as argu \u0010 ments in support of this option, are reinforced by the relative ease with which it could be implemented. The value of employer \u0010paid life insurance, unlike the value of some other fringe benefits, can be accurately measured and allocated. Employers could report the premiums they paid for each employee on the employee's W \u00102 form and compute withholding in the same way as for wages. In \u0010 deed, employers already withhold taxes on the life insur \u0010 ance premiums they pay that fund death benefits above the $50,000 limit. Yet a tax incentive to purchase life insurance might be called for in certain circumst ances. One such case might be if people bought too little life insurance because they systematically underestimated the potential financial hardship for their families that their death might bring. Whether, in fact, people purchase too little insurance for that reason is unclear. Moreover, even if too little life in \u0010 surance was purchased, a more efficient way of encourag \u0010 ing people to buy it might be to extend the favorable tax treatment to all purchasers and avoid favoring only people with insurance provided by employers.

Life insurance policies and annuities often combine fea \u0010 tures of both insurance and tax \u0010favored savings accounts. (An annuity is a contract with an insurance company un \u0010 der which a person pays a single premium, or a series of premiums, and the company provides a series of fixed or variable payments to that person at some future time, usually during retirement.) The investment income from the money paid into life insurance policies and annuities, sometimes called inside buildup, is not taxed until it is paid out to the policyholder. If it is left to the policy \u0010 holder's estate or used to pay for life insurance (in the case, for example, of whole \u0010life policies), it can escape taxation entirely. The tax treatment of inside buildup is similar to the taxation of capital gains. Under this option, life insurance companies would in \u0010 form policyholders annually\u2014just as mutual funds do now\u2014of the investment income realized on their ac \u0010 count, and people would include those amounts in their taxable income. As a result, disbursements from life in \u0010 surance policies and benefits from annuities would no longer be taxable when they were paid. Making such in \u0010 vestment income taxable as it was realized would raise $11.2 billion in 2004 and a to tal of $105.2 billion from 2004 through 2008; in addition , its tax treatment would then match that of income from a bank account, taxable bond, or mutual fund. Tax on the investment incomefrom annuities purchased as part of a qualified pension plan or qualified individual retirement account would still be deferred until benefits we re paid. By taxing the investment income from life insurance poli \u0010 cies, this option would eliminate a tax incentive to pur \u0010 chase life insurance, which may or may not be useful. En \u0010 couraging such purchases would be desirable if people systematically underestimated the financial hardship that their death would impose on spouses and families. Such shortsightedness could cause them to buy too little life insurance or, similarly, t oo little annuity insurance to protect themselves against outliving their assets. However, there is little evidence of such shortsightedness. A drawback of using tax \u0010deferred savings as an incentive to purchase life insurance is that it provides no induce \u0010 ment to purchase term life insurance (because term insur \u0010 ance has no savings component). Under the assumption that some incentive to purchase insurance would, indeed, be useful, an alternative a pproach might be to encourage the purchase of life insurance directly, by giving people a tax credit for their insurance premiums or by allowing them to take a partial deduction. Annuities already re \u0010 ceive favorable tax treatment through special provisions for pensions and retirement savings.

Note: * = less than $50 million. Investment income that is received by a dependent child under age 14 and that exceeds specified limits is taxed at the parents' marginal rate (the rate of tax on the last dol \u0010 lar earned). In 2001, the applic able limit on such income was $1,500. The provision\u2014often referred to as the kid \u0010 die tax\u2014is intended to restrict parents' ability to reduce the income tax on their investment income by trans \u0010 ferring ownership of income \u0010producing assets to their young children. It does not, however, preclude parents from cutting their tax bill by giving such assets to child \u0010 ren older than 13. Under current law, income from assets in the name of a child over age 13 is taxed at the child's rate, which is generally 10 percent or 15 percent, rather than at the parents' rate, which can be as high as 37.6 percent in 2004. As an exampl e, the difference in rates on $10,000 in annual income from assets can cut the family's tax bill from $3,760 to $1,000, or by more than 70 percent. This option would raise the age limit\u2014from 14 to 18\u2014 below which a child's income from investments is taxed at the parents' rates. The option would increase income tax revenues by $400 million over the 2004 \u00102008 period. Extending the kiddie tax to the income of older children would help prevent parents from sheltering assets to re \u0010 duce the taxes they have to pay. But the assets of older children may be their own. A teenager may have earned and saved a substantial amount of money or may have received sizable gifts. In that case, it is reasonable to tax the income from those assets at the child's rate rather than the parents'. Indeed, imposing the parents' higher rate could discourage teenagers from saving their earnings or gifts.208 BUDGET OPTIONS Revenue Option 12 Include in Adjusted Gross Income All Income Earned Abroad by U.S. Citizens Total (Billions of dollars) 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2004-2008 2004-2013 Added Revenues 0.7 3.0 3.2 3.4 3.6 13.9 34.4 Source: Joint Committee on Taxation. U.S. citizens who live abroad are required to file a tax return but may exclude from taxation some of the income they earn there\u2014in 2002, up to $80,000 for single filers and as much as $160,000 for qu alifying married couples. That exclusion, along with one for foreign housing and the usual personal exemptions and deductions, means that Americans residing abroad and earning close to $100,000 may not incur any U.S. tax liability, even if they pay no taxes to the country in which they reside. U.S. citizens with foreign \u0010earned income above the exclu \u0010 sion amount also receive credits for taxes they pay to for \u0010 eign governments, which may eliminate tax liability on that income under the U.S. tax system. This option would retain the credit for taxes paid to for \u0010 eign governments but include in adjusted gross income all income earned abroad by U.S. citizens residing there. Thus, under the option, Americans living in foreign countries that have tax rates higher than those in the United States would generally not owe U.S. tax on their earned income, whereas those living in relatively low \u0010taxcountries could have some U.S. tax liability. The option would increase revenues by $0.7 billion in 2004 and $13.9 billion over the 2004 \u00102008 period. Proponents and opponents of this option part company on issues of equity and efficiency. Proponents argue that U.S. citizens should pay U.S. taxes under this country's tax system because they still receive the benefits of citizen \u0010 ship, even as foreign residents. They also maintain that U.S. citizens with similar in come should incur similar tax liabilities, regardless of where they live, and note the un \u0010 fair advantage gained by individuals who have moved to low\u0010tax foreign countries to escape U.S. taxation while retaining their American citizenship. In contrast, oppo \u0010 nents note that U.S. citizens who live in other countries do not receive the same volume of government services that U.S. residents receive. They also argue that the exclu \u0010 sion of foreign \u0010earned income makes it easier for U.S. multinational firms to find American employees who are willing to work and live abroad.CHAPTER THREE OPTIONS THAT AFFECT REVENUES 209 Revenue Option 13 Expand the Medicare Payroll Tax to Include All State and Local Government Employees Total (Billions of dollars) 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2004-2008 2004-2013 Added Revenues 0.9 1.1 1.1 1.0 0.9 5.0 8.0 Source: Congressional Budget Office. Certain groups of employees of state and local govern \u0010 ments are not covered by Medicare on the basis of that employment and thus do not pay the Medicare payroll tax. (All federal employees have been covered since 1983, as required by the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982.) The Consolidat ed Omnibus Budget Recon \u0010 ciliation Act of 1985 mandated that state and local em \u0010 ployees who began work after March 31, 1986, pay Medicare payroll taxes, but it did not make coverage mandatory for people hire d before that date. The Omnibus Budget Reconcilia tion Act of 1990 expanded Medicare tax coverage to in clude all state and local gov \u0010 ernment employees who were not covered by a state or local retirement plan. Making all state and local government employees who are not now covered under Medicare subject to the pay \u0010 roll tax would raise $0.9 billion in revenues in 2004 and a total of $5.0 billion fr om 2004 through 2008. The an \u0010nual gain in receipts would decline gradually as employ \u0010 ees who were hired before April 1986 left the payrolls of state and local governments. Only one out of 10 state and local employees is not cov \u0010 ered by Medicare through their employment, but most of those workers will still receive Medicare benefits when they retire because under current law, many of them will qualify for benefits on the basis of other employment in covered jobs or through their spouse's employment. As a result, requiring all state and local employees to pay Medicare payroll taxes could be justified on grounds of fairness. The program's broader coverage would lessen the inequity of the high levels of benefits received by those employees in relation to the payroll taxes they paid. Of course, expanding Medicare coverage to include more state and local employees would increase the federal gov \u0010 ernment's liability for future benefits under the program.210 BUDGET OPTIONS Revenue Option 14 Calculate Taxable Wages in the Same Way for Both Self-Employed People and Employees Total (Billions of dollars) 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2004-2008 2004-2013 Added Revenues On-budget 0.2 0.3 0.3 0.3 0.3 1.4 3.1Off-budget 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 1.0 2.2 Source: Congressional Budget Office. Social Security and Medicare levies come in two forms: the Federal Insurance Contribution Act (FICA) tax paid on wages and the Self \u0010Employment Contribution Act (SECA) tax paid on income from self \u0010employment. Un \u0010 der FICA, employees and employers each pay a Social Security tax of 6.2 percent on wages up to a taxable maxi \u0010 mum ($87,000 in 2003) and a Me dicare tax of 1.45 per \u0010 cent on all wages. Until 1983, the SECA rate was lower than the combined employer and employee rate under FICA. As part of the Social Security Amendments of 1983, the Congress increased th e effective SECA rates starting in 1984. The conference committ ee said that the law was \"designed to achieve parity between employees and the self \u0010employed\" beginning in 1990. Despite the Congress's stated intent, the current method for calculating SECA taxes allows a self \u0010employed tax \u0010 payer to pay less tax than a worker with the same nominal income who is not self \u0010employed. For example, an em \u0010 ployee who earns $50,000 and hi s or her employer each pay $3,825 in FICA taxes, so that employee's total com \u0010 pensation is $53,825 (the employ er's share is considered compensation), and the to tal FICA tax is $7,650. But if that worker's self \u0010employed sibling also earned total com \u0010 pensation of $53,825, he or she would pay only $7,605 in SECA taxes, or $45 less than the employee sibling would pay. The difference arises because the self \u0010 employed sibling will have a calculated taxable income base that is lower than that of the employee sibling. Un \u0010 der current law, the income base on which self \u0010employed people calculate their tax equals total compensation less 7.65 percent. Thus, the self \u0010employed sibling pays taxes on $49,707, but the employee sibling pays taxes on $50,000.Among people with earnings above Social Security's tax \u0010 able maximum, workers who are self \u0010employed pay the same amount of Social Security tax that employees pay, but they pay less Medicare tax. For example, an employee earning $100,000 and his or her employer each pay $5,394 in Social Security taxes and $1,450 in Medicare taxes, so that employee's total compensation is $106,844 and the total FICA tax is $13,688. That person's self \u0010 employed sibling\u2014with the same total compensation\u2014 pays the same maximum Social Security tax but only $2,861 in Medicare taxes, or $39 less. (The self \u0010employed person pays Medi care taxes on $96,824, whereas the em \u0010 ployee pays Medicare taxes on $100,000.) High \u0010income, self\u0010employed taxpayers may pa y as much as 6.3 percent less in Medicare taxes under SECA than employees with similar total compensation pay under FICA. That differ \u0010 ence has existed since 1991, wh en the Congress first set the taxable maximum for Medicare higher than the tax \u0010 able maximum for Social Security. Eliminating the differ \u0010 ence would require a slight change in Schedule SE (the income tax form for reporting self \u0010employment income), but it would directly affect only a relatively small per \u0010 centage of self \u0010employed taxpayers\u2014those with income above the taxable maximum. Changing the formula for ca lculating SECA taxes would increase on \u0010budget revenues by $1.4 billion from 2004 to 2008. Off \u0010budget SECA revenues, which are credited in the Social Securi ty trust funds, would increase by $1.0 billion. CHAPTER THREE OPTIONS THAT AFFECT REVENUES 211 Revenue Option 15 Subject All Earnings to th e Social Security Payroll Tax Total (Billions of dollars) 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2004-2008 Security\u2014which is composed of the Old \u0010Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance (OASDI) programs\u2014 is financed by a payroll tax on employees, employers, and self\u0010employed people. The receipts from that tax go to trust funds (essentially accounting mechanisms that the government uses to track receipts and spending for pro \u0010 grams with specific taxes or other revenues earmarked for their use). Only earnings up to a specified maximum amount are taxed, although that amount automatically increases each year. (In 2003, the maximum amount of earnings taxed un der Social Securi ty is $87,000.) This option would make all earnings subject to the payroll tax, generating $66 billion in re ceipts in 2004 and a total of about $468 billion from 2004 through 2008. Some of those revenues, however, wo uld be offset by the addi \u0010 tional retirement benefits that Social Security would pay to people with income above the current law's maximum taxable amount. When Social Security bega n in 1937, about 92 percent of the earnings from jobs covered by the program were below the maximum taxable amount. That percentage gradually declined over time because the maximum rose only occasionally, when the Congress enacted specific in \u0010 creases to it. In the 1977 amen dments to the Social Secu \u0010 rity Act, the Congress raised the percentage of covered earnings subject to the tax to 90 percent by 1982 and also provided for an automatic increase in the ceiling each year thereafter equal to the growth in average wages. Despite that indexing, the fraction of taxable earnings has slipped over the past decade as a result of faster \u0010than\u0010 average growth in the earnings of the highest \u0010paid work \u0010 ers. In 2000, approximately 85 percent of earnings from employment covered by OASDI fell below the maxi \u0010 mum.Subjecting all earnings to the payroll tax, proponents of this option argue, would have several positive effects\u2014for example, it would improve the balances of the OASDI trust funds. Proponents also contend that the option would increase the progressivity of the payroll tax. Be \u0010 cause people who have income above the ceiling do not pay the tax on all of their earnings, they pay a lower share of their total income in payroll taxes than do people whose total earnings fall below the maximum. Making all earnings taxable would raise payroll taxes for high \u0010 income earners, making the tax more progressive. Al \u0010 though that change could also entitle people with earn \u0010 ings above the old maximum to higher Social Security payments when they retired, the additional benefits would be small relative to the additional taxes those earners would have to pay. An alternative option would maintain a cap on earnings subject to tax but raise it sub \u0010 stantially above its curre nt level of $87,000. Doing so would generate less additional revenue and increase the progressivity of the tax system by less than would a com \u0010 plete removal of the cap. Opponents of this option could argue that improving the solvency of the trust funds on paper would not necessarily improve the economy's ability to pay future benefits, since the trust funds are only accounting mechanisms. Removing the earnings cap could also weaken the link between the taxes that workers pay into the system and the benefits that they receive, an important aspect of the Social Security system since its inception. Additionally, this option would reduce the rewards from working for people whose earnings are above the maximum now, be \u0010 cause those earnings would become subject to the payroll tax. As a result, such workers would have an incentive to work less or to take more compensation in the form of fringe benefits that would not be subject to payroll taxes.

U.S. multinational corporations generally pay U.S. tax on their worldwide income, including the income they earn from operations of their branches or subsidiaries in other nations. Foreign nations also tax the income from those operations, and the U.S. tax code allows multina \u0010 tional firms to take a limited credit for that foreign income tax. The credit is applied against what the firms would have owed in U.S. taxes on that income, but it cannot exceed what they would have owed if the income had been earned in the United States. If a corporation pays more foreign tax on its foreign income than it would have paid on otherwise identical domestic income, it accrues what the tax code ca lls excess foreign tax credits. In contrast to incom e generated by operations abroad, the income corporations earn from products that are sold abroad but produced domestically results almost entirely from value created or added in the United States. Hence, the income that U.S. firms receive from exports typically is not taxed by foreign nations. But the tax code's \"title passage\" rule specifies that the source of a gain on the sale of a firm's inventory is the place to which the legal title to the inventory \"passes.\" If a firm exports its inventory abroad, the title passage rule allocates the income from those sales in a way that, in effect, sources half of it to the jurisdiction in which the sale takes place and half to the place of manufacture. In practice, that means that if the firm's inventory is manufactured in the United States and sold abroad, half the income from the sale is still treated as though it were foreign in source\u2014even though the firm may have no branch or subsidiary located in the place of sale and the foreign jurisdiction does not tax it. The upshot of this rule is that a firm can classify more of its income from exports as foreign in source than could be justified solely on the basis of where the underlyingeconomic activity occurred. A multinational firm with excess foreign tax credits can then use those credits to off \u0010 set U.S. taxes on that foreign income. As a result, about half of the export income received by companies with such credits is effectively exempted from U.S. tax, and the income allocation rules essentially give U.S. multi \u0010 national corporations an incentive to produce goods domestically for sale by their overseas subsidiaries. This option would replace the title passage rule with one that apportioned income for the purpose of taxation on the basis of where a firm's economic activity actually occurred. The change would increase revenues by $1.8 billion in 2004 and $20.5 billion over the 2004 \u00102008 period. Export incentives, such as those embodied in the title passage rule, do not boost overall levels of domestic in \u0010 vestment and employment, nor do they affect the trade balance. They increase profits\u2014and thus investment and employment\u2014in industries that sell substantial amounts of their products abroad. But the U.S. dollar appreciates as a consequence, making foreign goods cheaper and thereby reducing profits, investment, and employment for U.S. firms that compete with imports. Export incen \u0010 tives, therefore, distort the allocation of resources so that the prices of the goods they affect no longer reflect the goods' production costs (either domestically or abroad). Foreign tax credits granted under U.S. tax law were in \u0010 tended to prevent business income from being taxed both domestically and abroad. But the title passage rule allows export income that is not usually subject to foreign tax to be exempted from U.S. taxes as well\u2014which means that the income escapes business taxation altogether. Hence, allowing multinational corporations to use for \u0010CHAPTER THREE OPTIONS THAT AFFECT REVENUES 213 eign tax credits to offset the U.S. taxes they would other \u0010 wise owe on export income may be an inappropriate use of such credits. Opponents of eliminating the title passage rule base their position on a perceived need to provide U.S. corporations with an advantage over foreign corporations that operatein the same markets. However, corporations without excess foreign tax credits receive no advantage. Thus, the rule gives U.S. multinational exporters a competitive ad \u0010 vantage over U.S. exporters that conduct all of their busi \u0010 ness operations domestically (and it gives U.S. multi \u0010 national exporters that have excess foreign tax credits an advantage over those that do not).

Under current law, U.S. \u0010owned corporations deduct state and local income taxes from their taxable income. How \u0010 ever, they receive tax credits\u2014a more favorable tax treat \u0010 ment in this instance than deductions\u2014for income taxes that they pay to foreign governments, including foreign subnational governments such as foreign states, cities, and provinces. This option would treat income tax payments to foreign subnational governments the way payments to domestic state and local governments are treated. That change would increase tax revenues by $2.6 billion in 2004 and $28.4 billion over the 2004 \u00102008 period. Specifically, this option would continue to allow corpora \u0010 tions to receive a credit for foreign taxes provided that those taxes exceeded a fixed percentage of either their foreign\u0010source income or their foreign income taxes. That percentage would be set to reflect the overall ratio of state and local to federal income taxes within the United States. Taxes for which credits were denied would be de \u0010 ducted from a corporation's foreign \u0010source gross income to yield its foreign \u0010source taxable income. The option could be structured to either defer to or override existing tax treaties between the United States and foreign govern \u0010 ments that call for other kinds of tax treatment.Proponents of this option would probably argue that its main benefit would be to level the playing field between domestic and foreign investment. The option would ac \u0010 complish that by reducing the slight incentive that U.S. \u0010 based multinational corporations now have to invest more abroad than at home, particularly in countries where the overall level of foreign income tax on a foreign investment is lower than the combined U.S. federal, state, and local taxes on a domestic investment. In turn, equal \u0010 izing the tax treatment of foreign and domestic invest \u0010 ment would allocate capital more efficiently worldwide. In some respects, however, removing the creditability of income taxes paid to foreign subnational governments would have drawbacks. The option would make U.S. corporations operating in a foreign country less competi \u0010 tive with other foreign companies operating there and would probably lead some firms to repatriate less income from prior overseas investments to avoid paying the ad \u0010 ditional U.S. tax. Furthermore, if foreign countries im \u0010 plemented similar rules for taxing income that their cor \u0010 porations earned in the United States, those firms might curtail their U.S. investments, and the amount of capital flowing into the United States might decline. RELATED CBO PUBLICATION :Causes and Consequences of th e Trade Deficit: An Overview , March 2000CHAPTER THREE OPTIONS THAT AFFECT REVENUES 215 Revenue Option 18 Set the Corporate Tax Rate at 35 Percent for All Corporations Total (Billions of dollars) 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2004-2008 2004-2013 Added Revenues 2.4 3.7 3.7 3.4 3.0 16.2 32.1 Source: Joint Committee on Taxation. Under current law, so \u0010called C corporations pay taxes on their income under a progressive schedule of four explicit marginal tax rates: 15 percent, 25 percent, 34 percent, and 35 percent. (The marginal rate is the percentage of an extra dollar of taxable income that a corporation must pay in taxes.) This option would tax all corporate taxable income at the single statutory rate of 35 percent, raising $2.4 billion in revenues in 2004 and a total of $16.2 billion from 2004 through 2008. (Of note is that replac \u0010 ing the current rate structure with the maximum rate would make debt financing more favorable than equity financing for those firms that are subject to a higher rate. As a result, this option might have some repercussions on how firms raise capital.) Under the progressive structure, corporate taxable income below $50,000 is current ly taxed at the 15 percent rate. Taxable income from $50,000 to $75,000 is taxed at 25 percent, and income from $75,000 to $10 million is subject to a 34 percent rate. Corporations pay the top tax rate of 35 percent on taxabl e income in excess of $10 million. But additional taxes are added to the explicit rates, which reduces the progressivity of the tax structure. As a result, firms with ta xable income of $18.3 million or more pay an average tax of 35 percent and receive no benefit from the progressive rate structure. The progressive rate schedule for the corporate income tax was designed to encourage entrepreneurship and to provide some tax relief to businesses with small and mod \u0010 erate levels of profit. Of the approximately 1 million cor \u0010 porations that have positive corporate tax liabilities each year, only a few thousand do not benefit from the sched \u0010 ule's reduced rates. Yet those few thousand firms earn ap \u0010 proximately 80 percent of all corporate taxable income.People who might favor this option would argue that corporations other th an small and medium \u0010sized firms receive favorable treatment under the progressive rate structure. For example, the structure allows large corpo \u0010 rations to shelter income or control the timing of income and expenses to reduce their taxable income for certain years. With the exception of owners of personal services corporations (such as physicians, attorneys, and consul \u0010 tants), whose firms are taxed at a flat rate of 35 percent, individuals can also benefit by sheltering income in the form of retained earnings in a small corporation. Another argument against a progressive rate structure is that it favors firms that may have relatively low profits because they are inefficient. Except in the case of new or small firms, low profits may imply a low return on capital investment. The earnings of C corporations are taxed twice, first at the corporate level and then at the individual level, if earnings are distributed to shareholders as dividends. Proponents of a progressive rate structure argue that it lessens the effect of that \"double taxation.\" Corporations may be able to avoid double taxation by operating either as an S corporation or as a limited liability corporation (LLC). Owners of such enterprises pay tax on total busi \u0010 ness income but at the rates of the individual income tax. However, the top individual rate is now above the cor \u0010 porate tax rate, making it relatively less advantageous for businesses that retain earnings to choose the S corporate form or that of an LLC.216 BUDGET OPTIONS Revenue Option 19 Repeal the \"Lower of Cost or Market\" Inventory Valuation Method Total (Billions of dollars) 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2004-2008 2004-2013 Added Revenues 0.2 0.6 0.6 0.6 0.3 2.3 2.9 Source: Joint Committee on Taxation. The lower of cost or market (LCM) method of inventory valu \u0010 ation provides favorable tax treatment to firms that use the first \u0010 in, first\u0010out approach to identifying inventory. Under the LCM method, firms are allowed to deduct from their taxable income unrealized year \u0010end losses on items in their inventory that have declined in value. (The losses are unrealized because the items have not actually been sold.) For items that have increased in value, they are permitted to defer taxes on unrealized gains until the year in which the items are sold. Similarly, under the sub \u0010 normal goods method of valuing inventory, firms may deduct inventory losses that arise from damaged or imperfect goods (or from similar causes), even if those goods may be sold and in \u0010 come realized in later years. This option would repeal the LCM and subnormal goods methods of inventory valuation over a three \u0010year period and require all firms to value their inventories at cost. (Under the cost valuation method, firms must include in taxable income both the gains and losses from any changes in the value of in \u0010 ventory when the goods are sold.) The option would increase revenues by $0.2 billion in 2004 and a total of $2.3 billion from 2004 through 2008. Inventory valuation is an integral component of determining a firm's taxable profits, which in accounting terms are the dif \u0010 ference between its receipts and the cost of the goods that it has sold. Under the accrual method of accounting, which firms typically use, the cost of goods sold is calculated by adding the value of the inventory at the beginning of the year to the cost of goods purchased or produced during the year and then sub \u0010 tracting from that total the value of the inventory at the end of the year. Firms may use either the LCM method or the cost method to value their inventory. Under the LCM method, the market value of each item in a firm's inventory is compared with its cost; the lower of the two values must be used for that item. The value of a firm's inven \u0010tory will be lower under the LCM method than under the cost method if the market value of any inventory item is below its cost. But the reverse is not true: inventory items that have appreciated in value over the year are still valued at their ori \u0010 ginal cost. Using the resulting lower value for a firm's year \u0010end inventory increases the cost of goods sold for a firm and lowers its taxable profits. In contrast, under the cost method of inven \u0010 tory valuation, gains and losses from changes in the value of inventory are included in taxable income only when the goods are sold. Opponents of repealing the LCM method of inventory valua \u0010 tion argue that for firms that incur inventory losses without gains to offset them, the method provides a \"cushion\" during economic downturns or periods of uncertainty created by shifts in markets. A taxpayer with inventories that have dropped in value has incurred an economic loss. If that loss is deferred (not accounted for) until the inventory is subsequently sold, the tax \u0010 payer may be viewed as being overtaxed. For firms that experience both inventory gains and losses, the LCM method provides favorable tax treatment. The asymmetric treatment of the gains and losses\u2014firms can recognize losses without counting comparable gains\u2014gives the LCM method a tax advantage over the cost method of accounting. As a result, a firm may claim a deduction for certain inventory losses even if the value of its entire inventory has increased. The LCM method has two other features that may offer unwarranted advantages to taxpayers that use it. First, once a firm has re \u0010 duced the value of its inventory, current law does not require i t t o r e c o r d a n i n c r e a s e i f m a r ket valu e s s u b s e q u e n t l y r i s e . Second, market values under the LCM method are based on the replacement cost of inventory items, not on their resale value. Thus, the method allows a firm to reduce the value of inventory items if their replacement cost has declined\u2014even though the firm may still be able to sell the inventory at a profit.CHAPTER THREE OPTIONS THAT AFFECT REVENUES 217 Revenue Option 20 Reduce Tax Credits for Re habilitating Buildings, and Repeal the Credit for Nonhistoric Structures Total (Billions of dollars) 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2004-2008 2004-2013 Added Revenues 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 1.0 2.4 Source: Joint Committee on Taxation. The Congress has enacted tax credits for rehabilitating buildings to induce people to preserve historic structures, prompt businesses to renovate their existing premises rather than relocate, and encourage investors to refurbish older buildings. The credit is 10 percent of expenditures on commercial buildings bu ilt before 1936 and 20 per \u0010 cent of expenditures on commercial and residential build \u0010 ings that the Department of the Interior has certified as historic structures because of their architectural signifi \u0010 cance. This option would reduce the credit for historic structures to 15 percent and repeal the credit for nonhis \u0010 toric structures, which woul d increase re venues by $0.2 billion in 2004 and by abou t $1.0 billion over the 2004 \u0010 2008 period. Repealing both credits would raise about $2.5 billion over the same period. Proponents and opponents of this option could mount several arguments to support their positions. On the one hand, proponents might say that the credits favor com \u0010 mercial structures over most rental housing and may therefore distort the allocation of capital. Moreover, in favoring renovation over new construction, the credits may encourage more costly ways of obtaining additional housing and commercial buildings. On the other hand, the option's opponents might contend that the credit may have social benefits when it encourages people to rehabilitate historically noteworthy buildings. The gov \u0010 ernment could promote that objective at a lower cost, however, by permitting a credit only for renovating certified historic buildings and by lowering the credit's rate. Some surveys indicate that a credit of 15 percent would be sufficient to cover the extra costs involved in undertaking rehabilitation that satisfied regulatory stan \u0010 dards for historic preservation.218 BUDGET OPTIONS Revenue Option 21 Tax Large Credit Unions Li ke Other Thrift Institutions Total (Billions of dollars) 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2004-2008 2004-2013 Added Revenues 0.6 1.0 1.1 1.1 1.2 5.0 12.0 Source: Joint Committee on Taxation. Credit unions are nonprofit institutions that provide their members with financial services\u2014for example, they ac \u0010 cept deposits and make loans. Originally, they were de \u0010 signed to be cooperatives whose members shared a com \u0010 mon bond\u2014in most cases, the same employer or the same occupation. Partly as a consequence of that distinc \u0010 tion, federal income tax law treats credit unions more favorably than competing thrift institutions, such as sav \u0010 ings and loans and mutual savings banks, by exempting their retained earnings from taxation. (Retained earnings are the portion of net income that credit unions reserve rather than pay out in dividends to members.) This op \u0010 tion would tax the retained earnings of large credit unions \u2014those with more than $10 million in assets\u2014similarly to the way retained earnings of other thrift institutions are taxed, but it would permit small credit unions (less than $10 million in assets ) to retain their tax \u0010exempt status. The option would ra ise $0.6 billion in revenues in 2004 and a total of $ 5.0 billion from 2004 through 2008. Initially, the retained earnings of credit unions, savings and loans, and mutual sa vings banks were all tax \u0010exempt. In 1951, however, the Congre ss eliminated the exemp \u0010 tions for savings and loans and mutual savings banks on the grounds that they were similar to profit \u0010seeking cor \u0010 porations. Since that time, large credit unions have come to resemble other thrifts. Beginning in 1982, credit union regulators have allowed a credit union to extend its ser \u0010 vices (subject to some restrictions) to members of organi \u0010 zations other than the one for which it was founded. In addition, most credit unions allow members and their families to participate even after a member has left the sponsoring organization. The result of that relaxation of restrictions is that mem \u0010 bership in credit unions has grown from about 5 millionin 1950 to about 70 million to day. Large credit unions, like taxable thrifts, now serve the general public and pro \u0010 vide many of the services offered by savings and loans and mutual savings banks. A significant number of credit unions offer mortgages and car loans, access to automatic tellers, credit cards, individual retirement accounts, and discount brokerage services. They also resemble thrift in \u0010 stitutions in that they retain earnings. Proponents of taxing the retained earnings of large credit unions similarly to the way earnings of other large thrift institutions are taxed might argue for it on the basis of efficiency. Similar tax treatment of like institutions pro \u0010 motes competition and the provision of services at the lowest cost. Proponents might also raise the issue of equity: other thrift institutions contend that credit unions use their retained earnings to finance expansion. Small credit unions are more like nonprofit organizations than like their larger counterparts, which supports the argument that their retained earnings should be tax \u0010 exempt, as those of nonprofit organizations are. Like those nonprofits, most small credit unions have members with a single common bond or association. And in some cases, their organizations are rudimentary: volunteers from the membership may manage and staff the credit union, and the level of serv ices may not be comparable with what other thrifts offer. Allowing small credit unions to retain their tax exemption for retained earnings would affect 8 percent of all assets in the credit union industry and about two \u0010thirds of all credit unions. However, a difficulty encountered in taxing the assets of large credit unions but allowing the assets of small ones to remain tax\u0010exempt is that the $10 mi llion cutoff in asset size could be viewed as arbitrary.CHAPTER THREE OPTIONS THAT AFFECT REVENUES 219 Revenue Option 22 Repeal the Expensing of Ex ploration and Development Costs for Extractive Industries Total (Billions of dollars) 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2004-2008 2004-2013 Added Revenues 2.9 3.9 3.0 2.1 1.2 13.1 15.7 Source: Joint Committee on Taxation. Through various tax incentives, the current tax system treats extractive industries (producers of oil, gas, and minerals) more favorably than most other industries (see Revenue Option 23). One incentive designed to encourage exploration and develop \u0010 ment of certain types of oil, gas, and hard minerals allows pro \u0010 ducers of those commodities to \"expense\" some of their explora \u0010 tion and development costs (deduct them from their taxable income when they are incurred) rather than capitalize them (de \u0010 duct them over time as the resulting income is generated). Eliminating the expensing of those costs would raise $2.9 bil \u0010 lion in revenues in 2004 and a total of $13.1 billion from 2004 through 2008. (The option incorporates the assumption that firms could still expense some of their costs, specifically those from unproductive wells and mines.) Immediately deducting costs contrasts with the tax treatment that other industries face, in which costs are deducted more slowly, according to prescribed rates of depreciation or deple \u0010 tion. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 established uniform capitali \u0010 zation rules that require certain direct and indirect costs related to property to be either deduct ed when the property is sold or recovered over several years as depreciation. (In both cases, the deducting of costs is postponed.) However, so \u0010called intangible costs (for example, maintenance of working capital) related to drilling and development and costs for mine development and exploration are exempt from those rules. Thus, the expensing of such costs provides an incentive for extractive industries that other industries do not have. (See Revenue Options 25 and 26 for other exceptions.)Costs for exploration and development that extractive firms can expense include costs for excavating mines, drilling wells, and prospecting for hard minerals\u2014but not for oil and gas. Al \u0010 though current law allows independent oil and gas producers and noncorporate mineral producers to fully expense their costs, it limits expensing to 70 percent of costs for \"integrated\" oil and gas producers (companies involved in substantial retailing or refining activities) and corporate mineral producers. Firms sub \u0010 ject to the 70 percent limit must deduct the remaining 30 per \u0010 cent of their costs over 60 months. The rationale for expensing the costs of exploration and devel \u0010 opment has shifted from its original focus. When the incentive was put in place, the argument was that such costs were ordi \u0010 nary operating expenses. Today, advocates of continuing the incentive justify it on the grounds that oil and gas are \"strategic minerals,\" essential to national energy security. But expensing works in several ways to distort the allocation of resources. First, it causes resources to be allocated to drilling and mining that might be used more productively elsewhere in the economy. Second, although the incentive might make the United States less dependent on imported oil in the short run, it encourages producers to extract more now\u2014perhaps at the cost of ex \u0010 tracting less in the future and having to rely more on foreign production. Third, expensing may result in production being allocated inefficiently within these extractive industries. Ineffi \u0010 ciency may occur because the magnitude of the incentive varies depending on factors that are not systematically related to economic productivity\u2014such as the difference between the im \u0010 mediate deduction and the true useful life of the capital\u2014as well as on whether the producer must pay the alternative mini \u0010 mum tax (in which case expensing is limited).

The current tax system in va rious ways favors extractive industries (producers of oil, gas, and minerals) over most other industries. One way is by allowing producers to de \u0010 duct immediately, rather than over time, the costs they incur for exploration and development (see Revenue Op \u0010 tion 22). Another is by allowing some firms to use the \"percentage depletion\" method to recover their costs rather than the standard \"cost depletion\" method. This option would repeal percen tage depletion, raising $0.1 billion in revenu es in 2004 and about $0.9 billion over the 2004\u00102008 period. The percentage depletion method of cost recovery is a tax incentive provided to certain types of extractive com \u0010 panies\u2014independent producers, owners of royalties, and \"nonintegrated\" firms (compa nies that are not involved in substantial retailing or refining activities). The tax code allows those firms to deduct from their taxable income a certain percentage of a property's gross income in each taxable year, regardless of the property's actual capitalized costs (that is, the deduction that should occur over time). In contrast, other industries (and, since 1975, integrated oil companies as well) use the cost depletion method. Under that approach, the costs that a firm recovers can \u0010 not exceed its expenses for acquiring and developing the property; under percentage depletion, they may. Thus, the percentage depletion method treats certain types of extractive companies more favorably than others. Unlike the expensing of exploration and development costs, however, percentage depletion applies only to a small portion of total oil, gas, and minerals production because it excludes the large integrated producers. Current law typically allows nonintegrated oil and gas companies to deduct 15 percent of their gross income from producing oil and gas, up to a ceiling of the income from 1,000 barrels per day. But the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 ma de percentage depletion even more generous for nonintegrated companies that are considered \"marginal\" producers (those with very low total production or production entirely made up of heavy oil). The deduction for marginal properties can be up to 25 percent of gross income if the price of oil drops low enough. Producers of hard minerals may also use per \u0010 centage depletion, but the statutory deduction percent \u0010 ages vary from 5 percent to 22 percent, depending on the type of mineral. Tax law limits the amount of percentage depletion to 100 percent of the net income from a prop \u0010 erty with oil and gas and 50 percent of the net income from a property wi th hard minerals. Percentage depletion has been justified on the grounds that oil and gas are \"strategic minerals,\" essential to na \u0010 tional energy security. But that method of recovering costs distorts the allocation of resources by encouraging more production in the oil and gas industry than among other types of firms. And, like expensing, percentage de \u0010 pletion can cause extractive businesses to allocate their resources inefficiently\u2014for example, by developing exist \u0010 ing properties rather than exploring for and acquiring new ones.

Oil producers currently receive a tax credit of 15 percent against their costs for recovering domestic oil by a quali \u0010 fied \"enhanced oil recovery \" (EOR) method. Qualifying methods are those that allow producers to recover oil that is too viscous to be extracted by conventional methods. The costs of labor, materials, equipment, repairs, and de \u0010 velopment as well as so \u0010called intangible costs related to drilling qualify for the credit, which phases out when oil prices rise above $28 per barre l (adjusted fo r inflation). The tax code also provides another incentive related to viscous oil. It allows producers to \"expense\" the costs of tertiary injectants\u2014the fluids, gases, and other chemicals that are injected into oil or gas reservoirs to extract highly viscous oil. Producers may deduct the full cost of those chemical injectants in the year in which they are used to extract oil. The expenditures for injectants also qualify for the EOR credit; however, the credit must be sub \u0010 tracted from the deduction if both are claimed for the same expenditure. Eliminating both the EOR credit and the expensing of tertiary injectants would increase reve \u0010 nues by $0.5 billion in 2004 and $3.0 billion over the 2004\u00102008 period. The Congress enacted the EOR credit as part of the Omnibus Budget Reconcilia tion Act of 1990. It was de \u0010 signed to increase the domestic supply of oil and reducethe demand for imported oil, particularly from producers in the Persian Gulf and other politically unstable areas. Legislators enacted the expensing of tertiary injectants in 1980 for similar reasons. However, without the tax incen \u0010 tives provided by the credit and expensing, the use of ter \u0010 tiary injectants to extract oil would not be economical, and enhanced oil recovery would not be an economically viable extraction approach (because it is more expensive than recovering oil by conventional methods). Advocates of retaining both provisions say they provide several benefits: they lower the cost of producing oil by unconventional, more \u0010expensive methods and enable pro \u0010 ducers to increase the extractable portion of a reservoir's oil beyond the normal one \u0010third to one \u0010half. Increased domestic production lessens short \u0010term dependence on foreign oil, but it also depletes domestic resources, en \u0010 couraging long \u0010term dependence on imports. Indeed, opponents of the tax incentives argue that these provi \u0010 sions are unlikely to reverse either the long \u0010term slide that has occurred in domestic production or the nation's growing dependence on imports. They also contend that the United States is now less vulnerable to disruptions in supply because it stockpiles oil in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and world oil markets have become increasingly competitive.

The tax code imposes excise taxes on motor fuels, but it par \u0010 tially exempts from those levies fuels that are blends of gasoline and alcohol (and that as a result have a higher oxygen content than gasoline alone). Repealing that partial exemption would raise $0.8 billion in revenues in 2004 and $4.4 billion over the 2004\u00102008 period. Those estimates incorporate the assumption that the Congress would also repeal the alcohol fuels credit, which producers may claim instead of the partial excise tax exemption. In almost all cases, however, the credit is less valu \u0010 able than the exemption and is rarely used. The tax incentive that the exemption represents applies only to blends that use alcohol fuels produced from nonfossil, or renewable, sources. One such fuel is ethanol, which is made primarily from corn and sugar. When used as a fuel, ethanol is eligible for a nonrefundable reduction in the excise tax\u2014 through the credit or the exemption\u2014of up to 53 cents per gallon. The magnitude of the reduction depends on the per \u0010 centage of alcohol in the fuel. For example, the exemption for gasohol, which is 90 percent gasoline and 10 percent ethanol, is 5.2 cents per gallon from the excise tax on gasoline of 18.3 cents per gallon. (The exemption goes to the firm that blends the ethanol with the gasoline.) It was first enacted in the 1970s and was scheduled to expire at the end of fiscal year 1999. But the Transportation Equity Act of 1998 extended it while grad \u0010 ually lowering the maximum amount. Thus, the exemption drops to 5.2 cents per gallon for 2003 to 2004 and 5.1 cents per gallon for 2005 to 2007. The entire exemption for gasohol is now scheduled to expire at the end of fiscal year 2007. The tax inducement had several main purposes when it was first enacted. One was to reduce the demand for imported oil, there \u0010by lessening U.S. dependence on foreign sources. Another was to provide an additional market for U.S. agricultural products by encouraging firms to produce ethanol domestically. Judging by sales of the motor fuel blends, the tax incentive appears to have successfully encouraged en ergy producers to substitute ethanol for gasoline. Today, as the incentive's supporters argue, the major justifica \u0010 tion for it is that using oxygenated fuels in motor vehicles generally produces less carbon monoxide pollution than using gasoline does. Those proponents might also point to the effect that repealing the incentive could have on federal outlays for price support loans for grains. Without the tax inducement to produce corn for ethanol, the price of corn might fall, which could lead the government to step in to help farmers. But any increase in outlays for price support loans, which is not in \u0010 cluded in the budget estimates for this option, would probably be much smaller than the projected boost in revenues from re \u0010 pealing the tax incentive. Regulations now in place under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, which mandate the minimum oxygen content of gaso \u0010 line in areas with poor air quality, raise questions about the continued need for the incentive. Further contributing to those questions are actions by the Environmental Protection Agency, which support the use of ethanol to meet the standards for oxy \u0010 gen content by restricting the use in gasoline of MTBE (an al \u0010 cohol fuel derived from fossil fuel sources). Another argument for repealing the exemption is that ethanol is more costly to produce than gasoline. The partial exemption might be eco \u0010 nomically inefficient if the adde d cost outweighed the value of the reduction in air pollution.

The current tax system allows timber producers to deduct from their taxable income, or \"expense,\" most of the costs of maintaining a stand of timber when those costs are incurred. (Such expenses include disease and pest control, brush clearing, and indirect carrying costs such as interest on loans and property taxes.) That tax treatment contrasts with the uniform capitalization rules that apply to such costs in most other industries. (See Revenue Options 22 and 24 for other exceptions to the rules.) Established under the Tax Reform Act of 1986 (TRA \u001086), the uni \u0010 form capitalization rules require that production costs be deducted only when goods or services are sold. When businesses are allowed to expense those costs (deduct them immediately), the effective tax rate on a producer's investment in them is zero. Thus, timber producers pay no tax on any income they use to cover those costs, and the tax code in effect favors timber production by defer \u0010 ring taxes that producers otherwise would owe on their income. (Under certain circumstances, however, the tax code limits losses from passive business activities, which may greatly curtail the deferral granted to noncorporate producers of timber.) This option would capitalize costs incurred after Decem \u0010 ber 31, 1999, for producing ti mber. It would raise $0.4 billion in revenues in 2 004 and a total of $2.4 billion from 2004 through 2008 by a ccelerating tax payments from timber producers. Various rationales have been offered for expensing the costs of timber production. The original justification was a general perception that such costs were for maintenance and thus deductible as ordinary costs of a trade or busi \u0010ness. When TRA \u001086 established uniform capitalization rules for other industries, one reason given for exempting timber production was that applying the rules to that in \u0010 dustry might have been unduly burdensome. But the exemption comes with an economic price. Allowing tim \u0010 ber producers to expense their production costs distorts investing in two ways: more private land is devoted to timber production than might otherwise have been the case, and trees are allowed to grow longer before they are cut (because producers do not have to harvest them quickly to finance their costs). Those outcomes could be considered beneficial if timber growing offered spillover benefits to society that market prices did not take into account. Otherwise, the tax \u0010favored treatment would lead to inefficiency in both the use of land and the rate of har \u0010 vesting. Whether timber production offers important spillover benefits is unclear. Standing timber provides some bene \u0010 fits by deterring soil erosion and absorbing carbon diox \u0010 ide (a gas linked to global warming)\u2014but producing and disposing of wood and paper products contribute to pol \u0010 lution. In the short run, capitalizing the costs of timber pro \u0010 duction might lower the price of domestic timber because producers would have an incentive to harvest trees earlier. In the longer run, however, it would raise prices and lower the value of the land used to grow timber. Another effect of capitalizing costs is that lease payments to private landowners by timber growers would probably decline, causing some land that historically has been devoted to growing timber to be used in other ways.

The income that local governments earn from any public utility, including electric power facilities, is exempt from federal income tax. In contrast, the income of investor \u0010 owned utilities is taxable. Taxing the income of public facilities for generating, tran smitting, and di stributing elec \u0010 tricity similarly to the income of investor \u0010owned facilities would raise $0.5 billion in re venues in 2004 and a total of $3.4 billion from 2004 through 2008. In the past, electricity was provided by local monopolies, in part to take advantage of cost \u0010saving economies of scale. Some of those utilities were public facilities, which devel \u0010 oped for a variety of reasons. For example, public facilities offered a feasible alternative in geographic areas where low population density caused the cost of power per customer to be high and private producers were reluctant to enter a market in which the potential for profit appeared inade \u0010 quate. Public utilities also developed in areas where citizens, worrying that a private provid er might exploit its position as a monopoly, wanted to ensu re that electricity would be available to all residential consumers at a reasonable cost. But times and circumstances change. States are in varying stages of deregulating electric power generation, in part because improved technologies have lessened the impor \u0010 tance of economies of scale and in part because electric ser \u0010 vice is almost universal in this country, even in areas of low population density. And the competition that the industry's restructuring brings, say advoca tes of this option, will pro \u0010 tect consumers from monopolistic pricing by private firms. Proponents of this option would contend that economic and technological changes, combined with the fact that approximately 75 percent of electric power is already provided by the private sector, cast doubt on the benefits society re \u0010 ceives from public \u0010sector involvement in this market. Even less clear are the benefits that federal taxpayers receive from treating the earnings of public providers of electricity more favorably than the earnings of private providers. Proponents might also argue that taxing publicly owned electric power facilities will spur competition, result in consumption of an economically efficien t amount of public power, and preserve the corporate tax base. One argument for exempting public power's income from taxation has been that it is a way to keep the price of power low and thus reduce the power costs of lower \u0010income people. But treating public utilities' income more favorably than other utilities' is an inefficient way of accomplishing that. The federal government helps lower \u0010income groups more directly with programs such as the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program of grants to the states. Taxing the income of public electric utilities might ad \u0010 versely affect consumers in some communities who rely on that source for their power. The tax would cause the price of publicly provided electricity to rise, and public utilities that found themselves uncompetitive might have to shut down some facilities that were inefficient. If those facilities were being financed with debt that had not yet been retired, state and local taxpayers could be left with significant costs. Further complicating a change such as the one described in this option are the numerous legal and practical issues that would have to be resolved if the federal government taxed income earned from what might be termed business enter \u0010 prises of state and local governments.

Corporations purchase life insurance policies in part to protect their firms against financial loss in case one or more of their important employees or owners dies. Pur \u0010 chases of life insurance that builds up a cash value provide a tax advantage if corporations pay the premiums on the policies indirectly (by increasing debt or other liabilities) and then deduct the interest they pay on that debt from their taxable income. The Internal Revenue Service will not allow corporations to deduct that interest if it can link a firm's increases in debt or other liabilities directly to its purchase of cash \u0010value insurance. Establishing a di \u0010 rect connection is difficult , however, because firms in \u0010 crease their liabilities for many purposes. This option would disallow a proportion of a firm's total deductions for interest equal to the proportion of its total assets invested in cash \u0010value life insurance policies. The option would not apply to insurance on the life of owners who had an interest of 20 percent or more in the firm. It would raise an estimate d $0.2 billion in revenues in 2004 and $2.4 billion over the 2004 \u00102008 period. The tax code's asymmetrical treatment of the investment income that a corporation receives from life insurance policies and its costs in relation to those policies is the source of the tax advantage. First, tax law exempts the in \u0010 vestment income (termed the \"inside buildup\") of a life insurance policy from corporate income tax. Second, it permits a corporation to deduct from its taxable income the interest on debt that is indirectly used to finance that investment. Such an approach opens the door to tax arbi \u0010 trage (broadly, gaining advantage from asymmetrical treatment of gains and losses in the tax code) because cor \u0010porations can generate interest deductions that they can then use to shelter other, taxable income. Individual tax \u0010 payers may not avail themselves of that advantage because the tax code does not allow them to deduct those interest payments. Over the past several years, corporations have been re \u0010 stricted from using life insurance policies to shelter in \u0010 come. After 1996, they could no longer deduct the inter \u0010 est on loans from an insurance company that used the cash\u0010value policy as collateral. (An exception was made, however, for insurance on certain key employees.) In 1997, the Congress and the Pres ident enacted a law that disallowed a proportion of a corporation's interest deduc \u0010 tions, but the law applied only to firms that purchased cash\u0010value insurance on the lives of people who were not employees or owners. This option would further prohibit such deductions except for purchases of insurance on the lives of people who own at least 20 percent of a firm. (This kind of disallowance has been used in other con \u0010 texts as well. In 1986, a propor tion of intere st deductions was disallowed for financial institutions that purchase debt issued by state and local governments whose interest is tax\u0010exempt.) Opponents of this option argue that a firm may have legitimate business reasons to purchase life insurance poli \u0010 cies on its employees and owners as well as other business reasons to issue debt, and that the firm may not be link \u0010 ing the two decisions to create a tax shelter. Proponents of the option argue, however, that firms in most cases intend to use the policies and debt to shelter income from taxation.226 BUDGET OPTIONS Revenue Option 29 Repeal Tax-Free Conversions of Large C Corporations to S Corporations Total (Billions of dollars) 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2004-2008 2004-2013 Added Revenues 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.5 1.0 Source: Joint Committee on Taxation. For tax purposes, the predominant forms of business enterprise are C corporations, S corporations, partner \u0010 ships, and sole proprietorships. Under current law, a C corporation may reduce taxes on some of its income by electing to be treated as an S corporation or by con \u0010 verting to a partnership. The income of C corporations faces a two \u0010tiered corporate tax; that is, it is generally taxed twice\u2014once when it is earned by the corporation and again when it is distributed to stockholders. Income received by S corporations and partnerships, in contrast, is taxed only once, at the individual income tax rates of the firms' owners. Over time, the distinction between S corporations and partnerships has blurred. Nevertheless, a C corporation that elects to change its tax filing status to that of an S corporation is treated more favorably than a C corpora \u0010 tion that converts to a partnership. Converting to an S corporation is tax \u0010free in many circumstances. Con \u0010 verting to a partnership is taxable; it requires the corpo \u0010 ration to \"recognize\" (include in its taxable income) any built\u0010in gain on its assets and requires shareholders to recognize any such gain in their corporate stock. Under section 1374 of the Internal Revenue Code, if a C corpo \u0010 ration converts to an S corporation, the appreciation of the firm's assets while it was a C corporation is not sub \u0010 ject to the corporate \u0010level tax\u2014unless the assets are sold within 10 years of the conversion. Thus, current law al \u0010lows a C corporation to avoid the two \u0010tiered corporate tax by converting tax \u0010free to an S corporation. This option would repeal tax \u0010free conversions for corpo \u0010 rations with a value of more than $5 million at the time of conversion. Thus, when a C corporation with a value of over $5 million converted to an S corporation, the cor \u0010 poration and its shareholders would immediately recog \u0010 nize the gain in their appreciated assets. This option would increase income tax revenues by $0.1 billion in 2004 and $0.5 billion over the 2004 \u00102008 period. Proponents of this option might argue that repealing tax\u0010free conversions by C corporations would treat economically similar conversions\u2014from two \u0010tiered cor\u0010 porate tax systems to single \u0010tiered systems\u2014in the same way. That equalization would, in turn, make tax consid \u0010 erations less important in decisions about the legal form that a firm might take. However, people who think S cor \u0010 porations more closely resemble corporations than they do partnerships might consider it beneficial to preserve the current differential tax treatment. According to that viewpoint, current law merely allows a corporation to change its filing status from that of a C corporation to that of an S corporation, providing it meets the legal re \u0010 quirements, without having to pay tax for choosing a dif \u0010 ferent corporate form.CHAPTER THREE OPTIONS THAT AFFECT REVENUES 227 Revenue Option 30 Tax the Income of Cooperatively Own ed Electric and Telephone Utilities Total (Billions of dollars) 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2004-2008 2004-2013 Added Revenues 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.5 0.8 Source: Joint Committee on Taxation.

They pay no tax on the portion of their income that they are required to distribute as dividends to their members, and they pay no tax on earn \u0010 ings from other sources, as long as at least 85 percent of their income comes from members for providing their primary service (electricity or telephone). Moreover, some forms of outside income\u2014including rental income from telephone poles that are leased to cable or telephone com \u0010 panies and income from the Yellow Pages, cable TV, and Internet access\u2014are not even counted toward the remain \u0010 ing 15 percent. Eliminating those exemptions, which essentially treat electric and telephone cooperatives more favorably than privately owned electric and telephone utilities, and tax \u0010 ing the co\u0010ops as ordinary for \u0010profit corporations would raise $0.1 billion in 2004 an d $0.5 billion over the 2004 \u0010 2008 period. In addition to exempting the co \u0010ops' in\u0010 come from the corporate income tax, current law does not levy taxes on their distributions of dividends to mem \u0010 bers\u2014whether as cash or as paym ents in kind in the form of household utility services. Eliminating that exemption could generate additional revenues. The tax breaks given to co \u0010ops, along with the low \u0010 interest loan program available through the Rural Utili \u0010ties Service, were created to encourage the wiring of rural areas for service. But now that most of the nation has telephone service, and the use of cell phones is wide \u0010 spread, there is little justification for the co \u0010ops' tax\u0010 favored status. As for electricity, most of the United States is already connected to the nationwide electricity grid, and the cost to distributors of providing electricity is probably the same for rural and urban customers. Moreover, the income of all electric cooperatives is exempted from taxation\u2014even that of generation co \u0010 operatives, which do not need the favorable treatment (because generating electricity does not cost more in rural areas). Finally, the market for electricity has been partially deregulated in the past few years. Continuing to provide this tax exemption in a more competitive environment gives cooperatives an advantage over utilities that are in \u0010 vestor owned and that pay corporate income taxes. Arguing against this option are its potential consequences for the co\u0010ops' customers. If the tax exemption was with \u0010 drawn and cooperatively owned electric and telephone utilities had to pay the same corporate income tax that other suppliers of electricity pay, rates might increase for the cooperatives' customers. Ending the exemption would also raise issues related to equity. Subjecting electric and telephone co \u0010ops to taxes that most other co \u0010ops do not pay would treat some kinds of firms more favorably than other, similar operations.

Note: * = less than $50 million. State and locally owned utilities, as well as a small num \u0010 ber of investor \u0010owned utilities, issue tax \u0010exempt bonds to finance the generation and transmission of electricity. Because the interest that utilities pay on those bonds is not taxed, investors are willing to accept a lower yield than they would otherwise require to purchase those se \u0010 curities. By allowing some utilities to finance new gen \u0010 erating and transmitting facilities through tax \u0010exempt bonds, the tax code treats those utilities more favorably than some others\u2014for example, most cooperatively or investor\u0010owned utilities that must issue taxable debt, on which investors require a higher rate of interest. This op \u0010 tion would eliminate the exemption and tax the interest earned on bonds used by state and locally owned utilities to finance new generating or transmitting facilities. The option would raise about $0.6 billion over the 2004\u00102008 period. State and locally owned utilities also use tax \u0010exempt bonds to finance the distribution and retailing of elec \u0010 tricity. This option does not apply to bonds for those purposes, although eliminating those tax exemptions could generate additional revenues. The option also does not apply to outstanding bonds that were used to finance existing generating and transmitting facilities. The market for electricity is becoming increasingly com \u0010 petitive. Many states have already deregulated the genera \u0010 tion sector of the electricity industry, allowing customers to choose their electricity supplier. More states are ex \u0010 pected to deregulate in the future. Utilities that have ac \u0010 cess to tax \u0010exempt financing have a lower cost of capital than do other providers of electricity. By using that lower\u0010cost capital to cut prices to their customers, such utilities not only encourage consumers to use more elec \u0010 tricity than they would otherwise have used but also gain an advantage over other utilities in competing for cus \u0010 tomers. Utilities that had access to lower \u0010cost capital and did not use it to cut prices would probably use it to sub \u0010 sidize other public services or support inefficient tech \u0010 niques for producing electricity. Opponents of eliminating the tax exemption argue that if it ended and state and locally owned utilities paid the same interest rate to attract capital for generation and transmission that other electricity suppliers pay, the rates charged for electricity by publicly owned utilities might rise. In addition, some people argue that the low cost of capital is necessary to finance universal service or afford \u0010 able electricity rates for some disadvantaged groups.

Note: * = less than $50 million. Taxpayers are generally allowed to recover the cost of depreciable business property under the tax code's modi \u0010 fied accelerated cost recovery system. They may also, under certain circumstances, expense rather than depre \u0010 ciate the first $25,000 of the c ost of deprec iable property \u2014that is, deduct it from taxable income in the year in which the property is placed in service, rather than over time, in scheduled increments . In addition , current law provides a temporary 30 percent expensing allowance for most depreciable equipment that is acquired after Sep \u0010 tember 10, 2001, and befo re September 11, 2004. But the cost recovery for vehicles with a loaded gross ve \u0010 hicle weight (GVW) unde r 6,000 pounds is generally subject to scheduled limits on those deductions. For tax year 2002, the depreciati on limits were $3 ,060 in the first tax year (or $7,660, if the te mporary 30 percent deprecia applied); in the third year; an d $1,775 in each additional year. (Those amounts are indexed for inflation as mea \u0010 sured by the consumer price index for automobiles.) As a result of those limits, the cost of acquiring a business \u0010 use automobile does not usually qualify for the full tax \u0010 favored treatment of expensing and accelerated deprecia \u0010 tion. However, the depreciation limits do not apply to vehicles with a loaded GVW of more than 6,000 pounds\u2014a cate \u0010 gory that includes most sport utility vehicles (SUVs) and light trucks\u2014whose cost can therefore be written off at a much faster rate. With that differential treatment, the tax code provides an incentive for business car buyers topurchase SUVs or other such heavy vehicles (that is, with a loaded GVW of more th an 6,000 pounds) when they might otherwise have purchased smaller automobiles. This option would apply the limited depreciation sched \u0010 ule to all business \u0010use SUVs and automobiles regardless of weight but would not change the tax treatment of other types of vehicles with a loaded GVW of more than 6,000 pounds. The option would raise $0.2 billion in revenues in 2004 and $1.0 billion over the 2004 \u00102008 period. Proponents of this option argue that SUVs are rarely needed for business use and that the option would in \u0010 crease economic efficiency by eliminating the tax incen \u0010 tive for businesses and self \u0010employed individuals to pur \u0010 chase them instead of smaller vehicles. Because heavy SUVs tend to emit more pollutants and have lower gas mileage than lighter vehicles, this option would also re \u0010 duce pollution and the consumption of fossil fuels. Opponents of this option would argue that the differ \u0010 ential tax treatment accorded to heavy SUVs used for business was appropriate in some cases (because the op \u0010 erations of some firms require that type of vehicle). Other opponents might also point out that this option does not eliminate the incentive for businesses and self \u0010employed individuals to purchase other vehicles with loaded GVWs exceeding 6,000 pounds, even though a smaller, less \u0010 polluting vehicle might be an acceptable alternative in those cases as well.230 BUDGET OPTIONS Revenue Option 33 Increase the Excise Tax on Cigarettes by 50 Cents per Pack Total (Billions of dollars) 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2004-2008 2004-2013 Added Revenues 6.6 6.5 6.5 6.6 6.6 32.8 65.5 Source: Joint Committee on Taxation. Taxes on certain goods and services can influence consu \u0010 mers' choices, leading people to purchase less of the taxed items than they might have otherwise. That taxation gen \u0010 erally leads to a less efficient allocation of society's re \u0010 sources\u2014unless some of the costs associated with the taxed items are not reflected in their price. Tobacco is one such product that creates \"external costs\" to society that are not covered in its pretax price\u2014for example, higher costs for health insurance to cover the medical expenses linked to smoking and the effects of cigarette smoke on the health of nonsmokers. But taxes increase prices and can result in consumers' paying the full cost (including the external costs) of smoking. In \u0010 creased taxes have also been shown to reduce the con \u0010 sumption of tobacco. Researchers estimate that each 10 percent increase in cigarette prices is likely to lead to a decline in cigarette co nsumption of 2.5 percent to 5 percent, with probably a larger decline for teenagers. Tobacco is taxed by both th e federal government and the states. Currently, the federal cigarette excise tax is 39 cents per pack; other tobacco products are subject to similar levies. In recent years, state excise taxes have in \u0010 creased from an average of 42 cents per pack in 2000 to an average of about 54 cent s per pack in 2002. In addi \u0010 tion, settlements reached between state attorneys general and major tobacco manufacturers require payments of fees equal to an excise tax of about 50 cents per pack. Federal tobacco taxes raised about $7.4 billion in fiscal year 2001, or about 0.4 percent of total fede ral revenues.This option would increase the federal excise tax on ciga \u0010 rettes by 50 cents pe r pack. It would generate $6.6 billion in added revenues in 2004 and a total of $32.8 billion from 2004 to 2008. No consensus exists about the magnitude of the external costs of smoking, which makes it difficult to judge the efficiency of tobacco taxes. Some economists estimate that the external costs of smoking are significantly less than the taxes and settlement fees now levied on tobacco. Other analysts think that the external costs are greater and that taxes should be boosted even more. Technical issues cloud the debate; for example, the effect of secondhand smoke on people's health is uncertain. Much of the con \u0010 troversy centers on varying theories about what to include in figuring external costs\u2014such as whether to consider tobacco's effects on the health of smokers' families or the savings in spending on health care and pensions that re \u0010 sult from smokers' shorter lives. Nevertheless, an increase in excise taxes on cigarettes may be desirable, regardless of the size of the external costs, if consumers underesti \u0010 mate the harm done by smoking or the addictive power of nicotine. Teenagers in particular may not be prepared to evaluate the long \u0010term effects of beginning to smoke, although all groups know that smoking has health risks. Arguing against taxes on tobacco is their regressivity; that is, such taxes take up a greater percentage of the earnings of low\u0010income families than of middle \u0010 and upper \u0010 income families. That imbalance occurs because lower \u0010 income people are more likely than other income groups to smoke and because expenditures on cigarettes by people who smoke do not rise appreciably with income.

In terms of the federal excise tax per ounce of ethyl al \u0010 cohol, current law treats alcoholic beverages in different ways. Levies remain much lower on beer and wine than on distilled spirits, and they are figured on different liquid measures. Distilled spirits are measured in proof gallons, a standard measure of a liquid's alcohol content; the current rate of $13.50 per proof gallon results in a tax of about 21 cents per ounce of alcohol. Beer, however, is measured by the barrel, an d the current ra te of $18 per barrel leads to a tax of about 10 cents per ounce of al \u0010 cohol (assuming an alcohol content for beer of 4.5 per \u0010 cent). The current levy on wine is $1.07 per gallon and results in a tax of about 8 cents per ounce of alcohol (as \u0010 suming an average alcohol content of 11 percent). In fiscal year 2001, federal excise taxes on dist illed spirits, beer, and wine brought in approximately $8 billion in revenues. This option would standardize the base on which the fed \u0010 eral excise tax is levied and use the proof gallon as the measure for all alcoholic beverages. It would also increase the tax to $16 per proof gallo n, raising about $4 billion in 2004 and a total of alm ost $24 billion between 2004 and 2008. A tax of $16 per proof gallon comes to about 25 cents per ounce of ethyl alcohol. It would boost the tax on a 750 \u0010milliliter bottle of distilled spirits from about $2.14 to $2.54, the tax on a six \u0010pack of beer from about 33 cents to 81 cent s, and the tax on a 750 \u0010milliliter bottle of table wine from about 21 cents to 70 cents. The consumption of alcohol creates costs to society that are not reflected in the pretax price of alcoholic beverages. Examples of those \"external costs\" include costs relatedto health care that are covered by the public, losses in productivity that are borne by others besides the alcohol consumer, and the loss of lives and property in alcohol \u0010 related accidents and crimes. Calculating such costs raises both practical and theoretical difficulties; however, a study reported by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism estimated that the external eco \u0010 nomic costs of alcohol abuse exceeded $100 billion in 1998. Increasing the price of alcoholic beverages through a hike in excise taxes would reduce the external costs of alcohol use and lead alcoho l consumers to pay a larger share of the costs of such consumption. Studies consistently show that higher prices lead to less consumption and less abuse of alcohol, even among heavy drinkers. Moreover, boost \u0010 ing excise taxes to reduce consumption may be desirable, regardless of the effect on external costs, if consumers are unaware of or underestimate either the harm that their drinking does to them and others or the extent of the addictive qualities of alcohol. Yet taxes on alcoholic beverages have their downside as well. They are regressive when compared with annual family income; that is, such taxes take up a greater per \u0010 centage of income for low \u0010income families than for middle\u0010 and upper \u0010income families. In addition, taxes on alcohol fall not only on problem drinkers but also on drinkers who impose no costs on society and are thus unduly penalized. Another consideration is that taxes may reduce consumption by some light drinkers whose intake of alcohol might produce be neficial health effects.

Federal taxes on motor fuel, which are used to finance highway construction and maintenance, are currently 18.4 cents per gallon of gasoline and 24.4 cents per gallon of diesel fuel. This option would raise those taxes by 12 cents per gallon, increasing revenues by about $15 billion in 2004 and$79 billion over the 2004 \u00102008 period. The total federal tax on gasoline under the option would be 30.4 cents per gallon. Imposing new or higher taxes on petroleum could have several beneficial effects. For example, making petroleum more expensive could encourage conservation and reduce pollution. Higher prices might encourage people to drive less or to purchase more \u0010fuel\u0010efficient cars and trucks. Less consumption of motor fuel would also lower carbon dioxide emissions and could therefore help moderate human impacts on the global climate. A further benefitis that the tax would offset, though imperfectly, the costs of pollution and road congestion that automobile use engenders. Increasing tax rates on motor fuels raises some issues of fairness, however. Higher rates would impose an added burden on the trucking industry and a disproportionate cost on rural households; yet the costs associated with vehicle emissions and congestion are greatest in densely populated areas, primarily the Northeast and coastal California. In addition, some researchers argue that taxes on gasoline and other petroleum products are regressive \u2014that is, they take up a greater percentage of the income of lower\u0010income families than of middle \u0010 and upper \u0010 income families. Other researchers find that the effects are proportionate.

Under the Clean Air Act, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) sets national standards for ambient air quality that are designed to protect the public's health and welfare. EPA defines acceptable levels for six \"criteria\" air pollutants: sulfur dioxide (SO2 ), nitrogen oxides (NOx), ozone, particulate matter, car \u0010 bon monoxide (CO), and lead. Along with emissions from natural sources, emissions of air pollutants from stationary sources (such as industrial facilities and commercial operations) and mobile sources (automobiles, trains, and airplanes) contrib \u0010 ute to the ambient levels of those criteria pollutants. Sulfur dioxide belongs to the family of sulfur oxide gases formed during the burning of fuel that contains sulfur (mainly coal and oil) and during metal smelting and other industrial processes. Exposure to high concentrations of SO2 may promote respiratory illnesses or aggravate cardiovascular disease. In addi \u0010 tion, SO2 and NOx emissions are considered the main cause of acid rain, which the EPA believ es degrades surface waters, damages forests and crops, and accelerates corrosion of build \u0010 ings. The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 adopted a program to control acid rain that introduced a market \u0010based system of emission allowances to reduce SO2 emissions. An emission allowance is a limited authorization to emit a ton of SO2. EPA allots tradable allowances to affected electric utilities on the basis of the utilities' past fuel use and statutory limits on emis \u0010 sions. Once the allowances are allotted, the act requires that annual SO2 emissions not exceed the number of allowances held by each utility plant. Firms may trade allowances, bank them for future use, or purchase them through periodic auc \u0010 tions held by EPA. Firms with relatively low costs for abating pollution have an economic incentive to reduce their emissions and sell surplus allowances to firms that have relatively high abatement costs.This option would tax emissions of SO2 from stationary sources that are not already covered under the acid rain program. The rate of the tax would be based on the average cost of an addi \u0010 tional reduction in SO2 emissions by those sources. That ap \u0010 proach would result in a tax of $200 per ton of SO2 and would raise about $2.6 billion in revenues over the 2004 \u00102008 period. Thus, the tax would both encourage further reductions in pol \u0010 lution and provide significant revenues. Major sources of pol \u0010 lutants currently pay user fees to cover the costs of a program providing operating permits (stating which air pollutants a source is allowed to emit) under the 1990 amendments to the Clean Air Act. Basing the tax described in this option on the terms granted in the permits would minimize the Internal Reve \u0010 nue Service's costs of administration. In general, taxes on emissions can help reduce pollution in a cost\u0010effective (least \u0010cost) manner. The tax described in this op \u0010 tion would lead to cost \u0010effective reductions in SO2 emissions by encouraging firms with abatement costs that are less than the tax to reduce their emissions and, at the same time, allowing firms with abatement costs that exceed the tax to continue emit \u0010 ting pollutants and pay the levy. Opponents of this kind of tax, however, might argue that it would impose a large burden on affected firms. Firms covered under this option would not only pay a tax on their emissions of SO2 but in most cases would also incur some costs for abate \u0010 ment (such as the cost of scrubbers and other equipment to reduce emitted pollutants). In contrast, regulatory approaches that mandated reductions in emissions would not require firms to pay that kind of levy on their allowed emissions.

Nitrogen oxides (NOx) usually enter the air as the result of high\u0010temperature combustion processes such as those found in automobiles and power plants. Emissions of NOx play an important role in the atmospheric reactions that generate ground \u0010level ozone (smog) and acid rain. Moreover, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) believes that NOx can irritate the lungs and lower a per \u0010 son's resistance to respiratory infections such as influenza. Nitrogen oxides and pollutants formed from them can be transported over long distances, so problems associated with NOx are not confined to areas where they are emitted. The Clean Air Act requires states to implement programs to reduce ground \u0010level ozone. Because of the transport \u0010 ability of NOx and ozone, the act requires upwind states to establish programs that will help downwind states meet statutory standards. In 1998, EPA promulgated the Ozone Transport Rule (commonly referred to as the NOx Sip call), which required 22 eastern states and the Districtof Columbia to revise their programs to reduce NO x emissions beyond the levels previously mandated underthe Clean Air Act. (The rule was subsequently revised to cover all or part of 21 states.) The rule did not mandate specific methods but instead gave each affected state a target for NO x emissions. In addition, EPA established a NOx budget trading program in which large electricity \u0010 generating units and industrial boilers may participate\u2014 provided that the state in which they are located ap \u0010 proves. Sources of emissions covered under that program would be issued a specific number of allowances that would entitle them to emit a limited amount of NOx each year. Firms would be required to hold an allowancefor each ton of NOx that they emitted and would be free to buy and sell allowances. Another way to help control NOx would be to tax emis \u0010 sions from stationary sources in states not covered by the NOx Sip call. Such a tax would apply to industrial facili \u0010 ties and commercial operations, including electricity \u0010 generating units and industrial boilers as well as other sources; it could provide significant revenues and encour \u0010 age further reductions in pollution below the level that current regulations require. Controlling NOx from sta\u0010 tionary sources costs be tween $500 and $10,000 per ton of emissions abated. Imposi ng a tax of $1,500 per ton of NOx emissions would encourage stationary sources that could reduce emissions at a cost below that amount to do so. Facilities with abatement costs that were higher than the tax could continue to pollute and pay the levy. A tax of $1,500 per ton would raise over $3.3 billion in reve \u0010 nues in 2004 and $21.0 billion over the 2004 \u00102008 period. Proponents of taxing pollution argue that such taxes dis \u0010 courage activities that impose costs on society and could help reduce air pollution in a cost \u0010effective (least \u0010cost) manner. Opponents of that kind of tax, however, might argue that it would impose a large burden on affected firms. Firms covered under this option would not only pay a tax on their emissions of NOx but in most cases would also incur some costs for abatement (such as the cost of scrubbers and other equipment to reduce emitted pollutants). In contrast, regulatory approaches that simply mandated reductions in emissions would not require firms to pay a tax on the emissions.

Under the Energy Tax Act of 1978, most automobiles whose fuel economy fails to meet a certain level are sub \u0010 ject to the gas guzzler tax. For example, the manufacturer of an automobile belonging to a \"model type\" whose ad \u0010 justed miles per gallon (mpg ) rate is under 22.5 pays a tax for each of those vehicles that it sells. (The adjusted mpg rate is a combined fuel economy measure that is cal \u0010 culated by assuming 55 perc ent city and 45 percent high \u0010 way driving.) The lower the gas mileage of the model type, the higher the tax that is paid. The maximum tax is $7,700 per vehicle with ga s mileage of less than 12.5 mpg. In fact, few vehicles are subject to the gas guzzler tax. Currently, the tax does not apply to vehicles that are rated at more than 6,000 pounds unloaded gr oss vehicle weight (GVW). In practice, it also does not apply to minivans, trucks, or sport utility vehicles (SUVs), a group collec \u0010 tively known as light trucks. One reason for that group's exclusion is that the tax code exempts \"non \u0010passenger vehicles\"\u2014as defined by th e Department of Transporta (DOT)\u2014from the tax. DOT's definition includes pickup trucks; vans; and most minivans, SUVs, and station wagons. Another reason is that the tax is imposed on the basis of the gas mileage of the model type to which the vehicle belongs. Model types are defined by the En \u0010 vironmental Protection Agency; each category comprises different vehicles that have one or m ore construction fea \u0010 tures in common. Hence, a vehicle with gas mileage of 15 mpg may not be subject to the gas guzzler tax because it is a member of a model \u0010type category that has an aver \u0010 age fuel economy of more than 22.5 mpg. This option would extend the gas guzzler tax to light trucks by increasing the tax's weight limit to 10,000pounds unloaded GVW, repealing the exemption for so \u0010 called nonpassenger vehicles, and calculating the tax per vehicle instead of on the basis of model type. The option would increase re venues by about $0.5 billion in 2004 and $2.9 billion over the 2004 \u00102008 period. Proponents of this option could argue that not applying the gas guzzler tax to light trucks creates an incentive for people to buy those large vehicles instead of smaller, more energy\u0010efficient ones. (In 1978, light trucks made up about 27 percent of retail sales of motor vehicles; in 2000, their share of the market was 50 percent.) Vehicles with low gas mileage generate more pollution than do vehicles with higher mileage, so taxing less \u0010efficient vehicles could reduce pollution. The tax was intended to encourage the manufacture and sale of energy \u0010efficient vehicles and the reduction of pollution, but it has been less effective than it might have been (because certain vehicles have been exempt). Opponents of the option might point out that many light trucks are used for purely commercial purposes and that this option would impose a burden on businesses that had economic reasons for purchasing larger vehicles. Op \u0010 ponents would also maintain that many light trucks carry more passengers than automobiles do, so pollution per passenger mile may be lower for those vehicles than for automobiles. Some observers would also argue that the gas guzzler tax should not be extended and that, in fact, the tax on passenger cars should be repealed and replaced with either a tax on the pollution that cars and light trucks emit or a tax placed directly on energy use (such as a gasoline tax). Those critics would say that such taxes would be more efficient than the current gas guzzler tax or a gas guzzler tax extended to light trucks.236 BUDGET OPTIONS Revenue Option 39 Impose a One-Time Tax on Emissions of New Automobiles and Light Trucks Total (Billions of dollars) 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2004-2008 2004-2013 Added Revenues 2.5 3.7 3.8 3.8 3.8 17.6 37.4 Source: Joint Committee on Taxation. The Clean Air Act Amendm ents of 1990 strengthened the provisions of the earlier law that sought to reduce emissions from mobile sources of pollution. The amend \u0010 ments raised the tailpipe standards for cars, buses, and trucks; they expanded inspection and maintenance pro \u0010 grams to include more regions with pollution problems and promote more stringent testing; and they introduced several regulations to reduce air pollution from mobile sources, including regulations for selling improved gaso \u0010 line formulations in some polluted cities to reduce levels of pollutants. In addition, the amendments tightened emission standards for vehicles to encourage the develop \u0010 ment of even cleaner cars and fuels. Despite progress to date in controlling air pollution from motor vehicles, mobile sources continue to significantly affect the nation's air quality. Nationwide, highway motor vehicles on average account for over one \u0010quarter of all emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), over one\u0010third of nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions, and more than half of carbon monoxide emissions. VOCs and NOx contribute to atmospheric reactions that gen \u0010 erate ground \u0010level ozone, which remains a pervasive pollution problem for many areas of the United States. Nitrogen oxides also contribute to the formation of acid rain, which the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) believes degrades surface waters, damages forests and crops, and accelerates corrosion of buildings. Carbonmonoxide reduces the ability of a person's blood to de \u0010 liver oxygen to vital tissues, affecting primarily the cardio \u0010 vascular and nervous systems. Taxing emissions of those pollutants from mobile sources could help reduce them by providing an additional incen \u0010 tive for consumers to purchase more \u0010fuel\u0010efficient cars and trucks. One option would be to impose a one \u0010time tax on new automobiles and light trucks. The tax could be based on the grams of VOCs (measured in grams of hydrocarbons), NOx, and carbon monoxide that a vehicle emitted per mile as estimated by the emissions tests that EPA requires for every new vehicle. The tax could be administered similarly to the current excise tax on luxury vehicles: the auto dealer would collect the tax from the vehicle's purchaser on behalf of the Internal Revenue Service. Such a tax, which would av erage $300 for each new pas \u0010 senger car and light truck sol d, could raise about $2.5 bil \u0010 lion in revenues in 2004 an d a total of $17.6 billion from 2004 through 2008. A disadvanta ge of the option, how \u0010 ever, is that it would leave out older cars and trucks, which account for a larger share of emissions from mobile sources than do new vehicles . A further drawback is that a one\u0010time emissions tax would raise the prices of new vehicles and might therefore induce people to delay pur \u0010 chasing them.

Under current law, firms that produce unconventional fuels or generate electricity from certain renewable forms of energy can claim a credit against their income taxes. Section 29 of the Internal Revenue Code offers credits to businesses that produce natural gas from coal seams (known as coalbed methane), oil from shale and tar sands, gas from geopressured brine and Devonian shale, energy from biomass (including landfill methane), and synthetic fuels from coal. Section 45 of the code offers credits to producers of electricity from wind, closed \u0010loop biomass (including landfill methane), and poultry waste. The tax credits may prompt some businesses to reduce the price of energy from those sources or may lead to larger profits for manufacturers. Lower prices\u2014or larger profits\u2014in turn may lead to greater reliance on uncon \u0010 ventional forms of energy. But that outcome has seldom been achieved. Only coalbed methane, landfill methane, and wind power have been commercially viable sources of energy. Eliminating the credits would increase reve \u0010 nues by $0.4 billion in 2004 and $3.0 billion over the 2004\u00102008 period. The credits were initially enacted to promote energy secu \u0010 rity and efficiency (by encouraging consumers to use al \u0010 ternatives to imported petroleum as well as energy that would otherwise be lost) and to foster a cleaner environ \u0010 ment (by encouraging the use of nonpolluting sources of energy). But proponents of eliminating the credits point out that the energy sources that benefit from them con \u0010 tribute very little to meeting the nation's energy require \u0010ments. Moreover, the limited success that markets for coalbed methane, landfill methane, and wind power have had is attributable less to the credits than to such factors as technological advances, rising natural gas prices, other federal programs (such as the Environmental Protection Agency's New Source Performance Standards), and sub \u0010 sidies from the states. Indeed, critics claim that far from benefiting the environment, the production of energy from some of the eligible sources causes environmental problems. (For example, wind rotors may endanger mi \u0010 gratory birds, and coalbed methane production may harm groundwater.) In addition, the credits may reduce eco \u0010 nomic efficiency by encouraging the use of relatively ex \u0010 pensive fuels. Finally, proponents of eliminating the credits believe that the goal of promoting a cleaner envi \u0010 ronment would be more efficiently achieved by imposing taxes on pollutants that reflect the damage they cause. Advocates of retaining the tax credits argue that they re \u0010 main an important part of the national policy to promote development of new sources of energy. Moreover, they believe that the credits help curb wasteful and polluting practices. For example, capturing landfill methane as a fuel rather than venting it into the air reduces odors and other hazards associated with emissions of landfill gas. And encouraging the use of poultry waste as fuel may help reduce the negative consequences\u2014such as water pollution and unpleasant odors\u2014of traditional means of its disposal. To the extent that the tax credits encourage the use of renewable sources of energy, they may also help moderate human impacts on the global climate.

Since 1981, the Superfund pr ogram of the Environmen \u0010 tal Protection Agency (EPA) has been charged with clean \u0010 ing up the nation's most hazardous waste sites. Most Superfund cleanups are paid for by the parties that are held liable for contamination of individual sites. In many cases, however, the liable parties cannot be identified, no longer exist, or are unwilling or unable to undertake the job. In such cases, EPA pays for the cleanup and, where possible, tries to recover the costs through subsequent enforcement actions. Money to pay for those EPA \u0010led cleanups and other pro \u0010 gram costs comes from an annual appropriation. Tradi \u0010 tionally, the Congress has designated two sources of funds in the appropriation: the general fund and balances in the Superfund trust fund (formally, the Hazardous Substance Superfund). Revenues credited to the trust fund have come primarily from taxes on petroleum and various in \u0010 dustrial chemicals and from a corporate environmental income tax. However, authorization for the taxes expired in December 1995, and the fu nd's balance has declined every year since 1997. The Congress has slowed the decline by relying more on the general fund as a source of the program's appropri \u0010 ated money. (Before 1999, the maximum contribution from the general fund wa s $250 million; in 2000, it was $700 million; in 2001, $634 million; and in 2002, $635 million.) Still, the available balance in the trust fund at the end of 2002 was expected to be just $427 million, or about one \u0010third of the program' s 2002 appropriation of $1.3 billion. Thus, future fu nding for the Superfund program will come almost entirely from the general fund unless the trust fund gets a new or renewed source of revenues. One option would be to reinstate the previoustaxes; doing so would yield revenues of $0.9 billion in 2004 and $6.7 billion over the 2004 \u00102008 period. Proponents of reauthorizing the taxes argue that they are consistent with the \"polluter \u0010pays\" principle. Specifically, proponents maintain that petroleum products and vari \u0010 ous chemical feedstocks and derivatives are common sources of contamination at Superfund sites and thus it is fair that producers and users of such substances, as well as corporations more broadly, foot much of the bill for the cleanup program. Some advocates of renewed taxa \u0010 tion also argue that EPA needs a stable source of funding for Superfund, for two reasons: to maintain multiyear cleanup efforts at the largest sites and to continue to pro \u0010 vide a credible threat that the agency will clean up sites and pursue cost recovery from liable parties who do not undertake cleanups themselves. Some people who oppose reinstating the taxes argue that the Superfund program should not be given dedicated funding until the Congress reforms the program's liability system and clarifies its future mission. Other opponents criticize the taxes themselves . They point to a 1995 analy \u0010 sis by the Brookings Institution and Resources for the Future, which found that the costs to administer and comply with the taxes were high, compared with the relatively small amounts collected. Also, they argue that the polluter \u0010pays principle may be relevant to Superfund's liability system but has no bearing on the question of who should pay for the cleanup of sites whose liable parties are recalcitrant or insolvent. Finally, opponents of reinstating the taxes argue that Superfund spending has always been subject to annual appropriations and thus dedicated taxes are no guarantee of stable funding.CHAPTER THREE OPTIONS THAT AFFECT REVENUES 239 Revenue Option 42 Consolidate Child-Related Tax Provisions Total (Billions of dollars) 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 tax code currently contains several provisions\u2014spe \u0010 cifically, the child credit and the exemption for depen \u0010 dents\u2014that benefit taxpayers with children. However, those provisions have different structures and rules for eli \u0010 gibility. The child credit equals $600 per child in 2003 and is refundable; the refundable portion\u2014the amount that exceeds tax liability and is paid to the taxpayer\u2014is limited to an amount equal to 10 percent of earnings above $10,500. The credit phas es out by $50 for every $1,000 of adjusted gross income over certain thresholds: $110,000 for married couples fi ling jointly, $75,000 for single taxpayers and heads of household, and $55,000 for married couples filing separately. Under the dependent exemption, a taxpayer may exclude (deduct) $3,050 from his or her taxable income for each child. The value of the exemption rises with the taxpayer's marginal tax rate (the rate on the last dollar of income), so upper \u0010income fami \u0010 lies receive greater tax savings from the deductions than their lower \u0010income counterparts do. This option would replace the two provisions with a single consolidated credit of $1,000 per child beginning in 2004. The consolidated chil d credit would retain a refundable portion, which would be determined in the same way as the refundable part of the current child credit. However, unlike the current credit, there wouldbe no phaseout, and the amount of the credit would be indexed for inflation. For the purposes of the credit, a child would be defined as either a son, daughter, stepson, stepdaughter, brother, sister, stepbrother, stepsister, or descendant of such individuals; as an adopted child; or as a foster child. The child would have to be under age 19 (or age 24, if he or she wa s a student) and live for more than half the tax year with the taxpayer (or tax \u0010 payers) claiming the credit. (Students would be exempted from the residence requirement.) The specific elements of this option are illustrative and could be modified to alter it s effect. As described, the option would reduce federal revenues by $0.4 billion in 2004 and $35.7 billion over the 2004 \u00102008 period. Proponents of this option might point out that consoli \u0010 dating the provisions into a single credit would substan \u0010 tially reduce complexity in this area of the tax code, as would the elimination of any phaseout. Opponents, how \u0010 ever, might express concern that some middle \u0010income taxpayers with children would see their taxes rise. They might also argue that the dependent exemption has been part of the tax code for a long time and many taxpayers may count on the money it represents when they make their financial plans. RELATED OPTION : Revenue Option 1240 BUDGET OPTIONS Revenue Option 43 Replace Multiple Tax Rates on L ong-Term Capital Gains with a Deduction of 45 Percent Total (Billions of dollars) 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2004-2008 2004-2013 Revenues 2.6 -4.4 -0.8 0.2 0.2 -2.2 0 Source: Joint Committee on Taxation. When a taxpayer sells an asset whose value has increased since it was purchased, he or she realizes a capital gain, which is subject to taxation. The gains realized on assets that are held for more than a year are taxed at lower rates than the rates that apply to ordinary income. Which capi \u0010 tal gains tax rate applies to a gain depends on the type of asset sold, how long it was held, when it was purchased, and the taxpayer's other income\u2014a level of complexity that requires numerous calculations by taxpayers to figure their tax. To simplify that process, this option would al \u0010 low taxpayers to deduct 45 percent of their net long \u0010term capital gains realizations from their taxable income\u2014 whether or not they itemized their other deductions. Taxpayers subject to the alternative minimum tax (AMT) would treat 30 percent of the deduction as preference in \u0010 come to adjust for the lower rate structure of that tax. (Revenue Option 44 discusses the AMT.) Although the five\u0010year total for the effects of this option shows a loss of revenues of $2.2 billion, th e option would be approxi \u0010 mately revenue ne utral from 2004 to 2013 (under the as \u0010 sumption that the change wo uld be enacted at the end of 2003 and become effe ctive January 1, 2004). The variety of long \u0010term capital gains tax rates in current law presents a substantial challenge to taxpayers who at \u0010 tempt to calculate their tax liability. For example, in 2002, a taxpayer who was in an individual income tax bracket of 27 percent or above and who sold stock owned for more than a year would generally pay tax of 20 per \u0010 cent on the realized gain. But if that stock had been an original issue of certain start \u0010up businesses and had been held for more than five years, the tax rate on the gain would be effectivel y 14 percent. If that stock had not been an original issue but had been purchased in 2001 or later, and if it was held for more than five years, thetax rate, as now scheduled, would be 18 percent. Fur \u0010 thermore, the taxpayer could face a 25 percent tax rate on some long \u0010term gains from real estate and a 28 per \u0010 cent rate on gains from the sale of gold, works of art, or other collectibles. Taxpayers in the 10 percent or 15 per \u0010 cent brackets of the individual incom e tax face lower rates on gains until they realize enough to push their income past the 15 percent bracket. Taxpayers who are subject to the AMT face different rates on gains from the sale of collectibles and from original stock issues of certain start \u0010 up businesses. Taxpayers with long \u0010term gains are required to go through many calculations to determine their tax. On their 2002 returns, ta xpayers with gains from the sale of general corporate stock, for example, have to complete 22 lines at the end of Sche dule D, Form 1040. Taxpayers with gains from collectibles, start \u0010up businesses, or depre \u0010 ciable real estate are sent to a 37 \u0010line worksheet. This option would reduce the number of lines that a tax \u0010 payer faced at the end of Schedule D to two or three, as was required between 1942 and 1986, when the tax code excluded gains from adjusted gross income. The deduc \u0010 tion under this option would be calculated like that ex \u0010 clusion but would not understate the income of taxpayers with gains in determining eligibility for tax credits and other options intended for lower \u0010income taxpayers. Under the option, a taxpayer's actual rate on capital gains would be 55 percent of his or her rate on ordinary in \u0010 come. In 2004, for example, someone in the 26 percent bracket for ordinary income would face a rate on gains of 14.3 percent, whereas som eone in the 37.6 percent bracket would face a rate on gains of 20.7 percent.CHAPTER THREE OPTIONS THAT AFFECT REVENUES 241 Switching to a uniform percentage deduction for long \u0010 term capital gains, however, would overturn several pro \u0010 visions of the tax code that were designed to improve effi \u0010 ciency or equity or to promote economic growth. As a result, careful consideration is warranted in weighing the benefits of those provisions against the benefits of sim \u0010 plification. A reduction of 2 percentage points in the gains tax rate on assets held more than five years was enacted partly to reduce the pressure on businesses\u2014which has been strong in recent years\u2014to meet quarterly earnings targets and produce short \u0010run increases in the value of their stock in order to attract investors. Excessively focusing on short \u0010 run results can deter businesses from undertaking more \u0010 productive actions that may take several years to reach fruition. However, much current short \u0010term trading is done by institutions, many of which are exempt from individual capital gains taxes. Furthermore, long \u0010term investors are not a necessary component of a firm's plan \u0010 ning for the long term. A string of investors who all hold a stock for short intervals can provide a market to main \u0010 tain the value of the firm's shares if the firm's long \u0010term plans are plausible. When the tax rate on gains held more than five years was lowered, an argument that was offered in support of the action was that gains resulting from inflation, which should not be taxed as income, grow over time. That argument is typically false, however, because it ignores the advantage that the tax code provides of deferring taxes on gains until an asset is sold. When deferral is accounted for, the effective tax rate on capital gains is still boosted by inflation, but the amount of that increase typically declines the longer an asset is held. Thus, if the lower statutory rate for gains (relative to ordinary income) was meant solely to account for inflation, that differential should decline the longer an asset is held. The current lower tax rate on capital gains realized from initial public offerings (IPOs) held at least five years was designed to encourage new enterprises that might develop new products and methods to benefit the entire economy. But evidence is lacking about how big those benefits actu \u0010 ally are; moreover, the costs from excess business forma \u0010 tion\u2014such as increased business failures\u2014must be con \u0010 sidered as well. Another question involves the size of thedifferential tax rate. When the differential was created in 1993, it reduced the ra te on gains from IPOs to half of the rate paid on other gains. But when the rates on other gains were re duced in 1997, that diffe rential was eroded. Now, the top rate of 14 percent on gains from IPOs may not be enough lower than the 20 percent and 18 percent rates on most other gains to justify the extra complexity that special IPO rates create. Gains on gold, works of art, and other collectibles are currently taxed at a higher rate (28 percent) than are gains on most other assets. Supporters of maintaining those higher rates justify their position by the lack of broader benefits\u2014in terms of innovation, new products, and higher productivity\u2014that society receives from those assets. But other observers argue that public benefits arise from the preservation of works of art. In any event, so few gains fall into this category that the economic efficiency resulting from having just the right tax rate for these assets may be less than the administrative costs of main \u0010 taining a separate rate. Certain gains from the sale of real estate are taxed at ordi \u0010 nary income tax rates up to a maximum of 25 percent (which is above the 20 percent rate levied on gains from most other assets). The higher rate could be justified on the grounds that such gains arise when tax deductions for depreciation turn out to have been excessive, a circum \u0010 stance that becomes evident when the structures are sold for more than their depreciated tax value. During the time that such property is being used to generate profits and rent\u2014which are taxed at ordinary income tax rates\u2014 the owners are taking deductions for the depreciation of the property's value that reduce their (ordinary income) taxes. Logic suggests that gains resulting from excess de \u0010 preciation deductions also be taxed at those rates; that rationale is followed in taxing\u2014at ordinary income tax rates\u2014the gains from all exce ss depreciation on sales of equipment and the portion of excess depreciation on real estate that results when depreciation for tax purposes is faster (because in some instances the tax code permits ac \u0010 celerated depreciation) than the conventional straight \u0010line method. However, the remaining fraction of the gains that owners derive from excess depreciation deductions on real estate is taxed at ra tes that are capped at 25 per \u0010 cent. This option would treat all excess depreciation de \u0010 ductions\u2014including that fraction\u2014as ordinary income242 BUDGET OPTIONS (and tax them at ordinary rates) on the basis of the above rationale and the goal of administrative simplicity. Argu \u0010 ments against taxing those gains at a higher rate than the rate imposed on some other gains could be based on the additional costs of administering a multirate system and the burden imposed on investors who have been taxed at gains rates since 1942. Current tax law also includes different capital gains tax rates for people with different levels of total income. Those rates reflect part of the progressive rate structure on ordinary income, but as separate rates, they add to the complexity of calculating overall tax liability. Under the option presented here, the progressive rates applicable to ordinary income would apply to capital gains as well.The benefits to be derived from multiple tax rates for capital gains may not be large, but the benefits resulting from simpler tax calculations may be no larger. The tax code's current complexity affects only the roughly one out of six taxpayers who report capital gains. Further \u0010 more, roughly three \u0010fourths of those with gains can avoid the most extended worksheets. Other taxpayers with sub \u0010 stantial capital gains typically use professional tax \u0010return preparers or computer software, both of which mitigate the burden of filling out the current forms\u2014although they impose added costs for filing. Finally, some of the current complexity could be eliminated by simply taxing all gains at the same rate, without turning to a deduction.

Under current law, the individual alternative minimum tax (AMT), as its name implies, is an alternate method of computing federal income tax liability. A minimum tax was initially en acted in 1969 amid concerns that tax- payers with substantial income were able to aggressivelyuse tax preferences to reduce their tax liability to very low levels\u2014in some cases, to zero. The present form of the AMT was largely enacted as part of the Tax Reform Act of 1986; it has since been mo dified several times, most recently by the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Recon-ciliation Act of 2001 (EGTRRA). To compute AMT liability, a taxpayer must add back several items to taxable income that are not regularly in- cluded in it, such as the deduction for state and local taxes, personal exemptions, and the standard deduction. AMT adjustments also include preferences that are gen- erally used only by taxpayers with complex financial cir- cumstances\u2014such as the preferences for certain intangi- ble costs of drilling for oil and gas. Those adjustments are replaced with an AMT exemption\u2014$33,750 for single taxpayers and $45, 000 for married taxpayers filing a joint return\u2014 that phases out at higher levels of income. The exemption is subtracted from income, yielding a tax- payer's alternative minimum taxable income (AMTI). AMTI is taxed at two rates: 26 percent on the first $175,000 and 28 percent on the remainder. Taxpayers must pay the higher of their AMT liability or their lia-bility under the individual income tax. Additionally, they may not take certain tax credits if the credit would make their individual income tax liability lower than their AMT liability.Unlike the schedule of brackets and exemptions for theindividual income tax, the AMT brackets and exemptions are not indexed for inflation. As a result, growth in nomi- nal income subjects more and more taxpayers to the alter- native tax. For a given level of nominal income, individ- ual income tax liability will decline over time as the value of personal exemptions and the standard deduction increases with inflation; in addition, the size of the lower tax brackets increases, so more income is taxed at lower rates. However, because AMT liability remains un- changed by inflation, with time it will exceed individual income tax liability over a larger and larger portion of the income range. Before passage of EGTRRA, the number of taxpayers subject to the AMT was projected to grow rapidly from 1.5 million in 2001 to 16 million in 2010. But EGTRRA lowered individual income tax rates with little change inthe AMT and so increased to 32 million the projected number of taxpayers who wi ll be subject to it in 2010. The law provided some relief from the AMT by in-creasing the size of its ex emption but only through 2004. Taxpayers who are subject to the AMT, or are close to being affected by it, have to calculate their taxes twice. As the number of those taxpayers rises sharply, the overall complexity of the tax system will increase. Many of those taxpayers will be in the AMT's ranks not because they are sheltering high income but rather because they have large numbers of dependents or high state and local taxes.244 BUDGET OPTIONS The AMT could be modified in several ways to provide some relief from its burdens. One option would be to make permanent the relief provided by EGTRRA and index the exemption amounts and brackets for inflation after 2004. Under that opti on, 21 million taxpayers would be moved off the AMT in 2010 (the peak year), and revenues for the 2004 \u00102008 period would fall by $71 billion. Another option would be to allow AMT \u0010 affected taxpayers to take the standard deduction, per \u0010 sonal exemptions, and the deduction for state and local taxes\u2014which would reduce the tax's rolls by 29 million in 2010 and lower re venues by $171 billi on over the five \u0010 year period. A third option would be to eliminate the AMT altogether. That approach would move 32 million taxpayers off the tax in 2010 at a revenue cost of $201 billion over five years. The primary benefit of these alternatives would be simpli \u0010 fication\u2014each one would simplify the tax system by re \u0010 ducing the number of taxpayers subject to the AMT. The first two options would provide relief to taxpayers with simple returns but maintain the goal of preventing high \u0010 income taxpayers from using tax shelters to avoid income taxes. The third option would reduce complexity the most. Proponents of AMT relief would also argue that many preferences that are not allowed by the AMT, such as personal exemptions and state and local taxes, represent differences in taxpayers' ability to pay taxes and conse \u0010 quently, equity calls for allowing those items to be sub \u0010 tracted from taxable income.Opponents of these options might argue against them on several counts. Because the options would reduce taxes, they would be costly, and the cost would rise as the amount of AMT relief increased. Equity could be at issue as well, given that higher \u0010income taxpayers would receive most of the options' tax relief. Approaches other than complete elimination of the AMT would leave in place some of the complexity of the current system; however, complete elimination would also result in cases in which high\u0010income taxpayers had little or no tax liability. A further consideration is that relief from the AMT would change the marginal tax rate (the tax rate on the last dollar of income) faced by taxpayers who are cur \u0010 rently subject to the tax and might thus alter their in \u0010 centives to work and save. Some taxpayers would see their marginal rates increase under these options, and others would see them decrease; on balance, though, more tax \u0010 payers would see marginal rate decreases. AMT relief might further affect incentives to work by reducing some taxpayers' tax burdens\u2014lower tax liability would allow those individuals to achieve the same level of after \u0010tax in\u0010 come with less income before taxes. How AMT relief on balance would affect incentives to work and save is not clear; it would depend on taxpayers' relative sensitivity to those incentives.CHAPTER THREE OPTIONS THAT AFFECT REVENUES 245 Revenue Option 45 Immediately Eliminate the Personal Exemption Phaseout and the Limit on Itemized Deductions Total (Billions of dollars) 2004 2005 2006 2007 current law, taxpayers subtract personal exemp \u0010 tions and either the standard deduction or itemized de \u0010 ductions from their adjusted gross income (AGI) to com \u0010 pute their taxable income. The value of both personal exemptions and itemized deductions is reduced for high \u0010 income taxpayers by gradually phasing them out above specified income thresholds. The provisions for the two phaseouts were enacted temporarily as part of the Omnibus Budget Reconcilia tion Act of 1990 and made permanent by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993. Under the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 (EGTRRA), both provisions are scheduled to phase out gradually over the next several years. In 2006 and 2007, their impact will be reduced by one\u0010third; in 2008 and 2009, it will be redu ced by two \u0010 thirds; and in 2010, the provisio ns will be repealed. Since EGTRRA remains in effect only unti l the end of 2010, the phaseouts will return, in their pre \u0010EGTRRA form, in 2011. This option would accelerate to 2004 the planned repeal of the phaseouts and make the repeal permanent. Im \u0010 mediate repeal would cost $5.5 billion in revenues in 2004 and $34.3 billion over the 2004 \u00102008 period. The personal exemption phaseout, often referred to as \"PEP,\" reduces the value of personal exemptions by 2 percent for each $2,500 of AGI above an income threshold. In 2002, that threshold was $137,300 for single filers and $206,000 for married couples filing a joint return. Thus, single taxpayers with AGI of $162,300 ($25,000 above the th reshold) would lose 20 percent of the value of their personal exemption. In2002, the value of personal exemptions was completely phased out for single filers with AGI above $259,800 and joint filers with AGI above $328,500. The limit on itemized deductions, often referred to as \"Pease,\" reduces them by 3 percent of the amount of AGI above an income thresh old\u2014which was $137,300 for all taxpayers in 2002. Thus, a taxpayer with $237,300 in AGI would have his or her itemized deductions reduced by $3,000, or 3 percent of the $100,000 in AGI above the threshold. Under current law, itemized deductions cannot be reduced by more than 80 percent. Repealing Pease and PEP woul d make the tax system less complex. Both provisions require numerous calculations by taxpayers to determine whether the provision applies to them and, if it does, to figure the impact of the phase \u0010 outs on their taxable income. Proponents of this option would argue that repeal would increase economic effi \u0010 ciency by lowering marginal tax rates (the tax rate applied to the last dollar of income). Currently, both provisions increase marginal tax rates over the portion of the income range that they affect and may thus reduce incentives to work and save. Opponents of this option might object to it largely on equity grounds. Because the tax system is progressive (rates rise with a taxpayer's income), higher \u0010income tax \u0010 payers get a bigger tax reduction from exemptions and deductions than do taxpayers in lower tax brackets. The Pease and PEP provisions reve rse that effect and increase the tax system's progressivity.246 BUDGET OPTIONS Revenue Option 46 Advance the Marriage Penalty Prov isions of the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 Total (Billions of dollars) 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 Committee on Taxation. Many married couples who file a joint return have higher tax liabilities than they would if they were allowed to file as individuals or as heads of household (single taxpayers with dependents). At the same time, many other married couples pay lower taxes than they would if they filed as single taxpayers. Whether a couple incurs a marriage \"penalty\" or receives a marriage \"bonus\" depends on the spouses' relative income: penalties generally occur when spouses have similar income, and bonuses occur when only one spouse works or when spouses have substantially different earnings. Penalties tend to be larger for couples with dependents who would qualify them to file as heads of household if they were not married. In 1999, just over 40 percent of married couples incurred marriage penalties averag ing $1,480, and about 50 per \u0010 cent received marriage bonuses averaging $1,600. Over \u0010 all, bonuses totaled $43 bi llion, or about $10 billion more than total penalties. High \u0010income couples were more likely to incur penalties and less likely to receive bonuses than were couples with lower income. About 70 percent of both penalties and bonuses affected couples with income above $50,000. Four provisions of the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 (EGTRRA) were designed to lessen the effects of the marriage penalty. Only one of those measures was fully im plemented in 2001; the others phase in over varying periods and at different times from 2002 through 2009. All of the measures expire on De \u0010 cember 31, 2010, leaving in plac e the same tax structure for married and unmarried taxpayers that existed before 2001. This option would fully implement those four pro \u0010 visions, effective in 2004, and make them permanent, at a cost of $16.7 billion for 2004 and $53.8 billion for the 2004\u00102008 period. A summary of the provisions follows.#EGTRRA established an individual income tax bracket of 10 percent, e ffective from July 31, 2001, through December 31, 2010. For a married couple filing a joint return, that bracket is twice the size of the corresponding bracket for unmarried individuals filing a single return. The bracket's upper dollar limits are fixed through 2007; they increase for single and joint filers by $1,000 and $2,000, respectively, in 2008 and are indexed to in flation for all taxpayers in 2009 and 2010. #From 2005 through 2009, the law gradually increases the standard deduction for married couples filing jointly from approximat ely 166 percent to 200 per \u0010 cent of the deduction for single taxpayers. Under that implementation schedule, the standard deduction for married couples filing jointly would be twice that for single filers in 2009 and 2010. #Between 2005 and 2009, EGTRRA widens the 15 percent individual income tax bracket for married couples filing jointly to twice that for a single filer. The current upper dollar limit on that bracket for joint filers is about 166 perc ent of that for single tax \u0010 payers. #Finally, for married couples filing jointly, EGTRRA increased by $1,000 the beginning and ending phase \u0010 out limits for income on which the earned income tax credit (EITC) applies in each of tax years 2002, 2005, and 2008. After 2008, those limi ts are indexed for in \u0010 flation. Before EGTRRA, the phaseout limits for single and joint filers were identical. Many analysts have observed that marriage penalties af \u0010 fect couples' decisions about whether to marry and howCHAPTER THREE OPTIONS THAT AFFECT REVENUES 247 much to work. Reducing marriage penalties would lessen the tax code's disincentives to marry and, if the changes in EGTRRA were made permanent, simplify families' financial planning. In addition, because this option would lower the marginal tax rate (the rate that applies to a taxpayer's last dollar of income) for many couples, it would help reduce the adverse impact of taxes on labor supply. Research has shown that how much the secondary earners in couples work\u2014that is, the spouses with the lower of the two incomes\u2014is particularly sensitive to tax rates. (An analysis published by the Congressional BudgetOffice in 1997, using si mulations and the pre \u0010EGTRRA tax code, indicated that higher tax rates for lower \u0010earning spouses could prompt them to work from 4 percent to 7 percent less than they might have if they could have filed individually.) Opponents of the option would argue that it would not only reduce marriage penalties but also increase marriage bonuses. The latter outcome would effectively penalize unmarried taxpayers relative to their married wealth to heirs during one's life through the strategic use of gifts (called inter vivos gifting), which is also a signi \u0010 ficant part of many taxpayers' estate plans, has also be \u0010 come more complicated under EGTRRA. Several options could be designed to modify the sched \u0010 uled phaseouts and eventual repeal of the estate tax (and generation \u0010skipping transfer taxes). They range from freezing EGTRRA's provisions as they stand in particular years (Options 1 and 2) to accelerating the repeal of estate taxes (Options 3 and 4). #Option 1 would retain the estate and gift taxes but permanently freeze the exemption and top rate at their levels in 2005\u2014for an estate exemption level of $1.5 million, a taxable gift exemption of $1 million, and a top marginal rate of 47 percent. In 2005 as well, the state death tax credit would be fully phased out and treated as a deduction. This option would increase revenues by $10.6 billion over the 2004 \u0010 2008 period. Under it, rece ipts would rise in 2007 and several subsequent years but would drop after 2011, when EGTRRA's provis ions would have ex \u0010 pired. Approximately 18,800 would be re \u0010 quired to pay some federa l estate tax in 2009 under this option, compared with approximately 12,300 under EGTRRA. #Option 2 would retain the estate and gift taxes but permanently set the exem ption at $3.5 million and the top tax rate at 50 perc ent, starting in 2004. The state death tax credit would be fully phased out in 2004, and state death tax paym ents would be treated as a deduction. Under this option, approximately 4,600 estates would be required to file federal estate and gift tax retu rns in 2005, compared with approxi \u0010 mately 15,700 under EGTRRA . The option would decrease revenues by $22.7 billion over the 2004 \u0010 2008 period. #Option 3 would permanently repeal the estate tax in 2004. It would retain the gift tax, with an exemption of $1 million, and set the top gift tax rate to equal the top individual income tax rate. As is the case under EGTRRA, the option would allow each estate to in \u0010 crease, or \"step up,\" the basis of the assets being trans \u0010 ferred by as much as $1.3 million. That element ofthe option affects the calculation of capital gains (or losses)\u2014and any applicable taxes\u2014when the assets are eventually sold. A capital gain or loss on an asset is measured by the amount of the proceeds received from its sale minus the taxpayer's basis in the pro \u0010 perty. A taxpayer's basis generally represents his or her investment in an asset. \"Carryover basis\" on inherited property means that the basis of an asset in the hands of the heir is the same as it was in the hands of the decedent. \"Stepped \u0010up basis,\" for estate tax purposes, means that the basis of the property passing from a decedent's estate is generally the fair market value on the date of the decedent's death or on the alternate valuation date, as specified by law. This option would also increase by $3 million the basis of property that could be transferred to a surviving spouse. It would reduce revenues by $137.0 billion over the period from 2004 through 2008. #Option 4 would make the repeal of EGTRRA's estate tax provisions permanen t in 2010 and permanently freeze the gift tax provisions as EGTRRA specifies for 2010. This option would re duce revenues by $161.7 billion over the 2004 \u00102013 period. Advocates of these options might argue that they would simplify estate planning by providing more certainty about future estate and gift tax law. Another potential benefit would be the options' exemption of smaller estates from the filing of estate tax returns, which would reduce the filing burden of those taxpayers. Under the options, smaller estates would also be more likely to avoid in \u0010 curring estate tax liability, which would reduce the poten \u0010 tial for small businesses to have to liquidate to pay estate taxes. Yet some observers criticize the first two options, which would retain the estate and gift taxes, as having the poten \u0010 tial to hurt small businesses. They point out that under the options, federal estate tax returns would still have to be filed for some estates and some estates would still incur estate tax liability. Other critics of these options would oppose the permanent increase in the exemption, prefer \u0010 ring that it return to $1 million in 2011. Opponents of the options for repealing the estate tax sup \u0010 port the progressivity of estate and gift taxes and believeCHAPTER THREE OPTIONS THAT AFFECT REVENUES 251 that they reduce the concentration of wealth in the United States. Some critics might also contend that re \u0010 pealing the estate tax would reduce charitable giving be \u0010 cause it would eliminate the tax deduction for charitable bequests and thus an incent ive that encourages individ \u0010 uals to make bequests. They also point out that, first, the negative impact of the estate tax on small estates and closely held businesses (for example, family \u0010owned firms) could be largely avoided by increasing the amount of the estate that was exempt from taxation; and second, evenbefore EGTRRA, very few businesses were forced to liquidate to pay estate taxes. Critics note as well that the repeal options do not eliminate the filing burden because many estates will still need to file returns and pay estate tax under state law. Both proponents and opponents of the estate and gift taxes make a variety of claims about the taxes' effect on savings, capital accumulation, and economic growth. However, research in those areas is inconclusive.4 Slowing the Long-Term Growth of Social Security and Medicare W ithout changes to federal programs for the elderly, the aging of the baby \u0010boom generation will cause a substantial deterioration in the fiscal position of the United States government. The demographics are inexor \u0010 able: the number of people age 65 and older will nearly double by 2030, while the numb er of adults under age 65 will grow by only about 15 percent. In addition to those demographic factors, the costs per enrollee in fed \u0010 eral health programs are likely to grow much faster than inflation. As a result, the amount that the federal government spends on its major retirement and health programs is projected to consume a substantial portion of what the government now spends on the entire federal budget. Beyond 2030, those pr essures will intensify as longevity continues to increase and health costs continue to grow, so simply weathering the demographic surge of the baby \u0010 boom generation will not be enough to restore the federal government's fiscal posture to its recent norms. To ac \u0010 commodate such growth in spending, either taxes would need to rise dramatically, spending on other federal pro \u0010 grams would have to be cut severely, or federal borrowing would soar. In recent years, the Congressional Budget Office has made a number of long \u0010range projections of spending. Those estimates are highly uncertain and very sensitive to even small changes in demographic and economic assumptions. Seventy \u0010five\u0010year projections prepared for this report merge CBO's assumptions for its current budget baseline for the ne xt 10 years with the long \u0010rangedemographic and economic assumptions of the Social Security and Medicare trustees. Like CBO's previous esti \u0010 mates, the 75 \u0010year projections reflect spending under cur \u0010 rent policies for the largest federal entitlement programs \u2014Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. The projec \u0010 tion for Social Security reflects growth in both the num \u0010 ber of recipients and wages (the latter being the basis on which individual benefits are calculated). The projections for Medicare and Medicaid also reflect a growing number of recipients as well as higher costs for medical care. For those projections, the rise in health care costs per recipi \u0010 ent is assumed to slow to a growth rate of 1 percentage point faster than gross domestic product per capita. While seemingly large, that rate is less than it has been in recent decades. According to CBO's new long \u0010range projections, which assume the current rules for benefits, outlays for Social Security, Medicare, and Medica id will grow as a share of GDP by more than two \u0010thirds by 2030, rising from 8 percent of GDP today to 14 percent. By 2050, outlays for the three programs could equal 17 percent of GDP and by 2075, 21 percent\u2014exc eeding the av erage shares of GDP absorbed by all federal spending and revenues over the post \u0010World War II period.1 1. For the purpose of the analysis pr esented in this chapter, the pro \u0010 jected shortfall of dedicated taxe s to finance Social Security and Medicare is ignored.CHAPTER254 BUDGET OPTIONS This chapter examines options for slowing the growth of Social Security and Medicare.2 Compared with the spend \u0010 ing trajectory under current law, the options would lessen the risk of unsustainable deficits and thus enhance the economic prospects of future generations. Of course, re \u0010 ducing the growth of Social Security benefits means lower future benefits than those currently scheduled under the law. However, the alternative of doing nothing could also mean lower benefits, given that the trustees for the two programs project that the Treasury Department's author \u0010 ity to spend for them will be curtailed abruptly\u2014in 2030 for the Hospital Insurance pa rt of Medica re and in 2041 for Social Security\u2014as the programs' respective trust fund balances would fall to zero in those years. (As ac \u0010 counting devices, the trust funds reflect spending author \u0010 ity, and their balances allow the Treasury to make dis \u0010 bursements for the programs, but they do not provide the resources to make benefit payments.) Moreover, that scenario does not reflect the potential strain on overall budgetary resources that is likely to occur when the reve \u0010 nues that the Treasury receives for the two programs fall below their spending\u2014which is projected to occur as early as 2010\u2014and the possibili ty that having to con \u0010 strain all other government activities will cause policy \u0010 makers to curb Social Security and Medicare spending much earlier than the dates projected for the depletion of the trust funds. That gap between the programs' spending and revenues grows wider with time. Any option to relieve the long \u0010term fiscal pressures re \u0010 quires either substantially constraining the growth of benefits or raising the burden on future taxpayers. There is no free lunch in addressing the looming strains that Social Security and Medicare could create. Economic growth that is greater than what is currently projected could help mitigate the problem but by itself is unlikely to render a solution. Greater economic growth could re \u0010 sult in higher incomes and thus higher tax receipts. But because expenditures for these two programs are driven in large measure by earnings in the economy (Social Security benefits are derived from an individual's wagehistory, and much of Medicare spending is composed of labor costs), a larger economy will also result in higher spending for the programs. A significant advantage of a larger economy comes from the timing of the higher potential receipts vis \u0010\u00e0\u0010vis the higher expenditures. The higher tax receipts would be collected while people were working, whereas a substantial portion of the higher ex \u0010 penditures would arise later, during their retirement years. That timing advantage may help, but given the magnitude of the projected fiscal pressures, it is unlikely by itself to be suffi cient to close the gap. The advantage of acting sooner rather than later is illus \u0010 trated by one of the options for Social Security discussed in the ensuing pages. Under the Social Security trustees' latest projections, in 2041 th e system will lack 34 percent of the resources that it needs to fully cover its benefit commitments. If the rise in the level of initial benefits was constrained by roughly 1 percent each year starting with people who retire in 2029, the system would still lack 29 percent of the resources needed in 2041. If that restraint started 10 years sooner (that is, with those retir \u0010 ing in 2019), the ga p in resources wo uld be 26 percent. If it started in 2009, the ga p would be on ly 14 percent, and if it started in 2004, the gap would shrink to 10 per \u0010 cent.3 Thus, the sooner action is taken, the less likely will be the need for an abrupt increase in taxes or a cut in the benefits of all recipients, not just a constraint on the incremental rise in initial benefits of new retirees. Social Security In 2002, the federal government spent over $450 billion to provide Social Security benefits to more than 46 mil \u0010 lion retired or disabled workers, their dependents, and survivors. According to CBO's projections, under the current structure of benefits, spending will exceed the tax 2. This chapter summarizes the situation for Medicaid; specific short \u0010 range options for that program a ppear in Chapter 2 on pages 128 to 133.3. For the alternatives that would begin to constrain the rise in initial benefits before 2029, CBO assu med that the normal retirement age for Social Security benefits would not increase beyond age 66\u2014 thereby keeping the alternatives from resulting in a decline in thereal value of benefits from one cohort to the next. Under currentlaw, the normal retirement age is scheduled to rise gradually from age 66 to age 67 beginning with people who become eligible in2017.CHAPTER FOUR SLOWING THE LONG-TERM GROWTH OF SOCIAL SECURITY AND MEDICARE 255 revenues earmarked for Social Security beginning in 2017. By 2030, total spending (in 2002 dollars) will reach about $1.2 trillion for 85 million bene ficiaries. On average, beneficiaries wi ll receive about $14,000 per year in 2030, compared with about $10,000 in 2002. Three broad approaches for slowing the growth in spend \u0010 ing for Social Security have received considerable atten \u0010 tion. First, policymakers could alter the formula used to calculate benefits for newly eligible Social Security benefi \u0010 ciaries to constrain the increase in initial benefits from one cohort to the next. Second, they could increase the age at which workers became eligible for full benefits, re \u0010 ferred to as the \"normal retirement age,\" which also would constrain the increase in initial benefits. Third, they could reduce the cost \u0010of\u0010living adjustments that beneficiaries received once they were on the rolls. Specific options to illustrate both the strengths and the weaknesses of those approaches are presented below, along with esti \u0010 mates of the savings they could bring. In general, workers are eligible for retirement benefits if they are at least age 62 and have had sufficient earnings on which they paid Social Security taxes in at least 10 years. Workers whose employment has been limited be \u0010 cause of a physical or mental disability can become eli \u0010 gible at an earlier age with a shorter employment history. Various rules apply to family members of retired, dis \u0010 abled, or deceased workers. If policymakers decide to slow the growth in Social Secu \u0010 rity benefits, equity and efficiency argue for enacting those changes long before they take effect. People view entitlement programs for the elderly and the disabled as long\u0010term commitments between the government and the citizenry, and they may have based their behavior on current provisions. Deciding soon on any future changes in such programs and making gradual changes in spend \u0010 ing and tax policies would give people more time to plan and adjust. The Congress set such a precedent when it amended the Social Secu rity system in 1983. When policymakers raised the age at which retired workers could receive full benefits, the first workers affected by that change were then only 45 years old. By announcing the change so far in advance, the government gave themthe opportunity to take that new policy into account when planning for retirement. Background on Social Security Social Security is, by far, the federal government's largestincome redistribution program, playing a critical role in supporting the standard of living of its beneficiaries. The Social Security system has two parts. The Old \u0010Age and Survivors Insurance (OASI) pr ogram is the part of the system that provides benefits to retired workers, members of their families, and their survivors. The other part, Dis \u0010 ability Insurance (DI), funds benefits for disabled workers younger than the normal retirement age and their de \u0010 pendents. OASI is by far the larger program: last year it accounted for about 85 percent of the spending for the two parts combined (referred to as OASDI). Benefits for both parts are financed primarily from payroll taxes paid by workers and employers on earnings covered by the OASDI program. The combined tax rate for 2003 is 12.4 percent of cove red earnings\u2014up to $87,000 annually. 4 In confronting the impending imbalance between bene \u0010 fits and the revenues designated to pay for them, the Congress will need to decide what the Social Security sys \u0010 tem should attempt to accomplish and what legislative changes will be needed to ensure that the system achieves those goals for the baby boomers and subsequent genera \u0010 tions. The current design of the Social Security system represents a trade \u0010off between ensuring a sufficient level of benefits for the poorest beneficiaries and distributing benefits so that workers who have paid more taxes for Social Security receive more in benefits. The progressive benefit structure of the program reflects the attempt to balance those two objectives. Retired workers with a his \u0010 tory of low wages receive benefits that replace a higher percentage of their preretirement earnings than do other 4. For a fuller discussion of how Social Security works and how changes to the program might affe ct the nation's ability to deal with its impending demographic shifts, see Congressional Budget Office, Social Security: A Primer (September 2001).256 BUDGET OPTIONS retired workers. Nonetheless, workers who earned higher wages receive a higher level of monthly benefits.5 Approaches and Illustrative Options for Slowing the Growth of Social Security To reduce the projected growth in spending for Social Security, legislation is needed to curtail the commitments made under current law. All of the approaches examined below have been proposed in recent years. The specific options shown here do not exactly replicate those ap \u0010 proaches; they are designed more to show their generic forms. The estimates of savings are intended to indicate relative magnitudes of change. Constrain the Increase in Initial Benefits . The most straightforward method of reducing the growth in Social Security spending is to slow the rates at which initial benefits rise from one cohort to the next. The effect of that approach would be to reduce the size of initial bene \u0010 fits going to each new group of eligible beneficiaries. The benefits awarded to them would still rise in nominal terms but only enough to keep up with inflation. That approach would not alter the benefits of those already on the rolls prior to its implementation. Procedures under current law base the benefits of retired (and disabled) workers on their past earnings, expressed as an average level of earnings over their working lifetime \u2014their average indexed monthly earnings (AIME). From that average, a formula calculates workers' primary insur \u0010 ance amount (PIA). The Social Security Administration then adjusts the PIA for a number of factors, such as re \u0010 ductions for early retirement, credits for later retirement, and increases for inflation. The Social Security Administration bases workers' AIME on wages in employment covered by the Social Securityprogram (up to the taxable maximum), with some adjust \u0010 ments. Earnings on which retired workers and their em \u0010 ployers paid Social Security taxes are indexed to compen \u0010 sate for past inflation and real (inflation \u0010adjusted) growth of wages. To convert the AIME to the PIA, the Social Security Administration applies a progressive formula in which the PIA replaces a higher proportion of preretire \u0010 ment earnings for people with low average earnings than it does for those with higher earnings.6 The thresholds used in that formula are in dexed to average annual earn \u0010 ings for the labor force as a whole. As a result of that fea \u0010 ture, benefits for future recipients are designed to grow in real terms. In general, workers will receive lower monthly benefits if they retire earlier than the normal retirement age. For example, workers who retire at age 62 in 2003 will receive a permanent 23 percent reduction. The size of that reduc \u0010 tion is intended to be actuarially fair: the present value of the reduced monthly benefits that average workers could expect at age 62 is roughly equivalent to the present value of the full monthly benefits they could expect by delaying initial benefits until the normal retirement age (for example, 65 years and 8 months for workers age 62 in 2003). Similarly, workers who delay collecting benefits beyond the normal retirement age receive a credit to compensate them for the reduction in the length of time that they will receive benefits.7 Workers who had average earnings throughout their career and retired at age 65 in 2002 were el igible for an annual benefit of about $13,500, which replaced 40 per \u0010 cent of their previous annual earnings. Under current law, workers with average earnings who retire at age 65 in the future will receive benefits that will replace a smaller per \u0010 centage of their past earnings. The scheduled increase in 5. Even though the formula for calc ulating monthly benefits is pro \u0010 gressive (in that it favors retired workers with low lifetime earnings), some people have questioned whether the overall benefit structureof the Social Security program is progressive. They point out that men with low lifetime earnings have shorter life spans, on average, than other men. Other people, however, observe that Social Secu \u0010 rity also provides benefits to th e survivors of deceased workers and to disabled workers\u2014features that contribute to the program's pro \u0010 gressivity.6. The following formula is used for workers who reach age 62 in 2003: PIA equals 90 percent of the first $606 of the AIME, plus32 percent of the AIME between and $3,653, plus 15 percentof the AIME over $3,653. 7. Starting with beneficiaries born in 1943, each year delayed beyond the normal retirement age will add 8 percent to their benefits. Thedelayed retirement credit for wo rkers reaching the normal retire \u0010 ment age in 2003 is 6.5 percent.CHAPTER FOUR SLOWING THE LONG-TERM GROWTH OF SOCIAL SECURITY AND MEDICARE 257 the normal retirement age, discussed below, will produce most of the decline in the replacement rate. Even with that decline, the real value of initial benefits will rise in the future as a result of the wage \u0010indexing ad \u0010 justments made in the calculation of benefits. An option that has received considerable attention would change the way benefits are calculated so that the real value of initial benefits would no longer rise. That option, which would link the growth in initial benefits to a price index, rather than to a wage index, would ensure that the purchasing power of future benefits was maintained, but it would no longer pass along gains in purchasing power that resulted from the growth of productivity in the economy. As a result, as long as average real wages continued to rise, the average replacement rate would fall for beneficiaries. Real benefits, however, would not decline.8 If such an option was im plemented in 2009, each cohort of newly retired and disabled workers thereafter would receive benefits that were lower than what they would have received under the current rules. The difference would increase over time\u2014cohort by cohort\u2014with its size determined by how much real wages grew. If the growth of real wages was ab out 1.1 percent per year, for example, the projected impact on future benefits would be quite large. For example, workers becoming eligible for benefits in 2030 would re ceive nearly 20 percent less than they would under the current rules, and workers becoming eligible in 20 75 would receive about 50 percent less. The value of the average benefits for each cohort would be similar to that for recent beneficiaries, but those benefits would replace a much smaller percent \u0010 age of earnings. CBO estimates that adoption of this op \u0010 tion would cut Social Securi ty outlays in 2075 by about 40 percent from what they wo uld be if bene fits remained as currently prescribed.9Raise the Retirement Age . Under current law, the age at which workers become eligible for full retirement benefits (or the normal retirement age) is 65 years and 8 months for people reaching age 62 this year and will gradually increase to 67. Fo r workers born before 1938, the normal retirement age was 65. That eligibility age increases in two \u0010month increments for workers thereafter, reaching 66 for workers born in 1943. It remains at 66 for workers born from 1944 through 1954. It then begins to rise again, in two \u0010month increments, until it reaches 67 for workers born in 1960 or later. Workers can still receive benefits at age 62, but with a larger reduction for taking them early (that is, prior to their normal retire \u0010 ment age). Some Members of Congress and others have recom \u0010 mended that the shift toward the normal retirement age of 67 be accelerated and that the age be extended further thereafter. Proponents point out that people age 65 today are projected to live significantly longer than was the case in the early days of the Social Security system, that life expectancy is projected to continue to increase, and that that otherwise favorable development will raise the cost of the program. Under the specific option illustrated here, the transition to the normal retirement age of 67 would be accelerated, followed by further increases so that the normal retire \u0010 ment age would keep up with assumed future increases in life expectancy ( see Table 4 \u00101). The normal retirement age of workers born in 1949 would be 67. Thereafter, the retirement age would increase by two months a year until it reached 70 for workers born in 1967. After that, it would increase by one month every other year. As under current law, workers would still be able to begin receiving reduced benefits at age 62, bu t the amounts of the reduc \u0010 tions would be larger. This option would produce sub \u0010 stantial savings in relation to projected spending levels under current law: by 2075, the savings would be about 20 percent. As with the option to constrain the rise in initial benefits, raising the normal retirement age to keep up with future increases in life expectancy would shift the nature of the government's commitment somewhat. Debate about the level of Social Security benefits tends to focus on how much beneficiaries will receive each month rather than8. To prevent real benefits from declining under this option, the normal retirement age was assume d not to increase beyond age 66. 9. The estimates for Social Security spending in this chapter are based on CBO's long \u0010term simulation model (CBOLT). The version of the model used here is based on a methodology and assumptionsabout key economic and demographic factors similar to those usedby the Social Security Administration's Office of the Chief Actuary.258 BUDGET OPTIONS Table 4-1.

Note: PIA = primary insurance amount. a. Under this option, the normal retirement age of workers who turned 62 in 2011 would be 67. After 2011, the retirement age wou ld increase by two months a year until it reached 70 in 2029, and then it would increase by one month every two years. on how much they will receive over their lifetime. But because of increasing longevity, a commitment to provide retired workers with a certain amount of monthly benefits at age 62 in, say, 2030, is actu ally more cost ly than that same commitment made to today's recipients. Linking the normal retirement age with future increases in life ex \u0010 pectancy is one way of dealing with that source of the program's rising costs. For most purposes, this approach to constraining the growth in benefits is equivalent to cutting replacement rates. However, the benefits of workers who qualify for Disability Insurance would not be reduced. Conse \u0010 quently, older workers nearing retirement would have a somewhat stronger incentive to apply for DI benefits in order to receive a higher monthly amount. For instance, under current law, workers retiring at age 62 in 2029 would receive 70 percent of their PIA; yet if they qualified for DI benefits, they woul d receive 100 pe rcent. Under this illustrative option for increasing the normal retire \u0010ment age, workers retiring at 62 in 2029 would receive only 55 percent of their PI A but would still receive 100 percent if they qualified for DI benefits. (To avoid in \u0010 creasing the incentive to apply for DI benefits, policy \u0010 makers could narrow that difference\u2014for example, by setting the benefits for workers who qualified for Dis \u0010 ability Insurance at the level they would have received upon retiring at age 65.) Reduce the Cost-of-Living Adjustment . Each year, the Social Security Administration adjusts monthly benefits by the increase in the consumer price index (CPI). For example, the 1.4 percent cost \u0010of\u0010living adjustment (COLA) effective for December 2002 wa s based on the increase in the CPI for urban wage earners and clerical workers (CPI \u0010W) between the thir d quarter of 2001 and the third quarter of 2002. The basic level of benefits is raised by the percentage increase in the CPI \u0010W beginning when workers become eligible for them, which for retired workers is age 62.CHAPTER FOUR SLOWING THE LONG-TERM GROWTH OF SOCIAL SECURITY AND MEDICARE 259 One way of reducing the growth in Social Security bene \u0010 fits is to reduce the automatic COLA. Some policymakers suggest that the law be changed to provide a COLA equal to the increase in the CPI minus a specified number of percentage points. To illustrate that approach, CBO esti \u0010 mated the effect of determining the COLA on the basis of the increase in the CPI minus 1 percentage point for December 2003 and thereaft er. Doing so would reduce outlays by about 10 percent in 2075; most of that reduc \u0010 tion (in percentage terms) would be achieved by 2030. Unlike constraining the increase in initial benefits and raising the retirement age, this option of reducing the cost\u0010of\u0010living adjustment could be used to reduce the growth in the benefits of current beneficiaries and work \u0010 ers who will soon be eligible for Social Security. The esti \u0010 mated impact on monthly benefits for those first two op \u0010 tions would progressively increase from one cohort to the next\u2014either because of real wage growth or increased longevity. Thus, the baby \u0010boom generation would incur a relatively small portion of the reductions in benefits. However, trim m ing the COLA would be one way of hav \u0010 ing the baby \u0010boom generation and future generations share more evenly in the reductions. Moreover, many economists believe that the CPI may overstate increases in the cost of living, but they disagree about the size of the overstatement. Devising a \"true\" cost\u0010of\u0010living index is problematic, and collecting and compiling data for such an index are difficult. For those reasons, economists have had trouble reaching a strong consensus on the issue. In 1996, the Advisory Commis \u0010 sion to Study the Consumer Price Index (known as the Boskin Commission) concluded that the CPI probably overstated the change in the cost of living by between 0.8 percentage points and 1.6 pe rcentage points a year.10 Since the commission's report was issued, the Bureau of Labor Statistics has made several changes to the way that it calculates the CPI and has thereby eliminated some of the problems with the index. But some thorny issues re \u0010 main, including how to measure the cost of living forSocial Security beneficiaries, whose purchasing patterns may differ from those of other consumers. To the extent that the CPI still overstates increases in the cost of living for Social Security recipients, policymakers could reduce the COLA by a corresponding amount without making benefits any lower in real terms than they were when the recipients became eligible for the program. In contrast to an equivalent across \u0010the\u0010board constraint on the increase in initial benefits (or an equivalent in \u0010 crease in the normal retirement age), reducing the COLA generally would most affect the oldest beneficiaries and those who initially became eligible for Social Security on the basis of disability. Alternatively, lawmakers might choose to reduce the COLA of only those beneficiaries whose benefits or income was above specified levels, but doing so would reduce the savings. (Some beneficiaries with low income and few assets would receive Supple \u0010 mental Security Income [SSI ] benefits, which would off \u0010 set some or all of the reduction in their Social Security benefits; the increased spending for SSI would help those beneficiaries, but it would also directly reduce the bud \u0010 getary savings from this option by a small amount.) The impact of even a relatively small reduction in the COLA would be quite large for older Social Security re \u0010 cipients in the future because their benefits would reflect the cumulative effects of a series of smaller adjustments tied to the cost of living. For example, if benefits were adjusted by 1 percentage point less than the increase in the CPI every year, beneficiaries at age 75 would incur a 12 percent reduction in be nefits compared with what they would have received under current law; at age 85, they would get a 20 percent reduction; and at age 95, they would get a 28 percent reduction. Conclusions About Social Security Reducing the growth in spending for Social Security would require cutbacks in the commitments that the law currently prescribes. Constraining the rise in initial bene \u0010 fits, gradually increasing the normal retirement age, or reducing the cost \u0010of\u0010living adjustment could all produce substantial savings and still preserve the basic benefit structure of the Social Security system. Each of the op \u0010 tions would also improve the outlook for the program's finances ( see Box 4\u00101).10. Advisory Commission to Study the Consumer Price Index, Toward a More Accurate Measure of the Cost of Living: Final Report to theSenate Finance Committee (December 1996).260 BUDGET OPTIONS Box 4-1. Impacts of Illustrative Options on Social Security's Finances When considering questions about the financial status of the Social Security program in isolation, analysts often use three measures. One looks at the relationship between the program's costs and income in any given year, as measured by the projected gap between the two, expressed as a percentage of payroll subject to the Social Security tax, focusing on the first year in which projected annual costs exceed projected revenues (other than interest). Another measure is the first year in which the combined Social Security trust funds are projected not to have an amount credited to them that is sufficient to pay that year's benefits. A third measure summarizes the expected adequacy of trust fund bal \u0010 ances over a specific projection period. The 75 \u0010year actuarial deficit is the difference between annual costs and income, expressed as a percentage of taxable pay \u0010 roll, summarized over the period. The table below pro \u0010 vides the Congressional Budget Office's estimates of those yardsticks under the current rules for calculating benefits and under each of the three options for Social Security that are presented in this chapter. By any of those yardsticks, the Social Security pro \u0010 gram's long \u0010term financial outlook is not good. In 2017, projected outlays for So cial Security will begin to exceed the tax revenues earmarked for the program. Once that happens, the federal government will need to draw on other resources to fund Social Security, eventhough the program's combined trust funds will con \u0010 tinue to be credited with interest on the balances. The trust funds themselves are projected to be depleted in 2041. The 75 \u0010year projected actuarial deficit in the trust funds is nearly 2 percent of taxable payroll\u2014 meaning that the present value of the projected finan \u0010 cial obligations of the program over that period sub \u0010 stantially exceeds the present value of the resources projected to be available to the program under current law. According to the program's actuaries, an immedi \u0010 ate, permanent 15 percent increase in the payroll tax or an equivalent reduction in benefits would be needed to eliminate that deficit. Each of the three illustrative options discussed in this chapter would improve the program's outlook, but only the option of constraining the increase in initial benefits would reduce the growth in costs by enough to ultimately close the gap between costs and income, prevent the trust funds from being depleted, and eliminate the 75 \u0010year actuarial deficit. The options of raising the normal retirement age and reducing the cost\u0010of\u0010living adjustment would delay the date at which the trust funds were depleted and would substantially reduce the actuarial deficit, but additional steps\u2014to slow the growth in benefits or to increase resources ear \u0010 marked for the program\u2014would be required to bring the program's finances into balance.

Federal Spending Under Illust rative Options for Slowing the Growth in Social Security (Percentage of GDP) Source: Congressional Budget Office. Note: See the text of this chapter for descriptions of the illustrative options. The option to constrain the rise in initial benefits by link \u0010 ing their growth to a price index rather than to a wage index would achieve the largest savings because once it was fully implemented, the nominal growth in Social Security benefits would no longer respond to the general growth in real wages in the economy. Thus, by 2075 projected spending for Social Security benefits as a share of GDP would be 4.2 percent of GDP (slightly below its current share) inst ead of rising to 6.6 percent, as pro \u0010 jected under current law ( see Figure 4 \u00101 and Table 4 \u00102). Neither of the other illustrative options would reduce the growth in benefits by enough to prevent outlays for the program from becoming a significantly larger share of national income once the baby \u0010boom generation retired. The option for increasing the normal retirement age would cut projected spendi ng in 2075 by about 1.4 per cent of GDP. Reducing the COLA would cut projected spending by about 0.7 percent of GDP. Considering Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid to \u0010 gether, CBO projects that, under current policies, the costs for the programs will increase from about 8 percentTable 4-2.

The effects of each illustrative option are considered in isolation; if joined together, the options would interact in ways that would reducethe combined savings.262 BUDGET OPTIONS this year to 21 percent by 2075. Even though constrain \u0010 ing the increase in initial benefits in the Social Security program by linking their growth to a price index\u2014the illustrative option producing the largest savings\u2014would solve that program's long \u0010term fiscal problem, it would eliminate only about one \u0010fifth of the projected increase in spending for the three programs combined. The other illustrative options would each make a notably smaller contribution toward slowing the growth in spending for all three programs. Additional savings could be achieved by combining the options, but doing so would further reduce the income of Social Security recipients. Medicare After changes in the reimbursement of providers were imposed under the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, per capita Medicare sp ending remained stable between 1997 and 1998, and it actua lly fell by nearly 2 percent in 1999. In 2000, it grew by only 2 percent. But that slowdown in spending was short \u0010lived. The growth in per capita spending resumed hi gher levels in 2001. CBO expects that growth to continue at high levels in the future, causing Medicare spending to increase from 2 per \u0010 cent of GDP today to about 9 percent in 2075. That long\u0010term projection is based on demographic forecasts similar to those used by the Social Security Administra \u0010 tion's actuary; and it assumes that spending growth per beneficiary from 2028 thro ugh 2075 will decline to 1 percentage point above the growth in per capita GDP \u2014which is similar to the intermediate assumption made by the trustees of the Medicare trust funds. That pro \u0010 jected rate of growth is considerably lower than the his \u0010 torical rate of growth for Medicare.11 Although CBO's projection is intended to reflect the path of spending under current law, it is based on the assumption that the private sector will act to cons train health care costs and that, in the long run, Medicare spending will have the same per capita growth rate as private health care.The same demographic trends contributing to growth in Social Security spending will drive long \u0010term growth in Medicare spending. The Medicare population will ex \u0010 pand rapidly as baby boomers retire and as longevity con \u0010 tinues to extend. Increases in the cost of the program per person will add to Medicare's long \u0010term cost growth. Medicare's payment schemes under its fee \u0010for\u0010service pro \u0010 gram, which covers approximately 88 percent of enroll \u0010 ees, create incentives for health care providers to increase the volume of services that they furnish. For each service (or bundle of services) from providers, Medicare makes a payment, so providers that are successful in increasing their volume of services increase their revenues. The pro \u0010 gram has limited ability to control through the payment system the total number of services furnished; instead, it generally can only set the amount of payment per service. That problem, driven by the volume of transactions, is most serious in physician services, although it also exists for durable medical equipment and laboratory services and other types of providers as well.12 Two broad approaches might be used to re duce federal spending on Medica re in the future: #Reducing the number of people who are eligible for benefits and #Lowering Medicare's costs per eligible person. Reducing the number of people who are eligible for bene \u0010 fits is a matter of determining which individuals would be affected and when to implement the change. Lowering Medicare's costs per person could be achieved in several ways. One would be to shift more expenses to enrollees by raising premiums or boosting cost sharing. Another way would limit what Medicare contributes toward health care expenses. A defined contribution could 11. For example, from 1970 to 2000 Medicare spending per beneficiary grew at an annual rate of abou t 3 percentage points above the annual growth in per capita GDP. Per capita spending on health care historically has risen faster than per capita GDP as a result of the introduction of new te chnology and muted concern by consumers about its cost because of insurance coverage.12. The Congress and the President have enacted legislation directed at controlling the volume of physician services (and thus the totalpayments to physicians) through a mechanism called the sustainablegrowth rate. That mechanism adju sts the payment rate per service to reflect the overall volume of services that has been furnishedin the past, relative to a target. If the volume of services exceeds the target, payment rates will be reduced; conversely, if the volumeof services comes below the targ et, payment rates will be raised.CHAPTER FOUR SLOWING THE LONG-TERM GROWTH OF SOCIAL SECURITY AND MEDICARE 263 strengthen consumers' and providers' incentives to seek efficient modes of care. Depending on the level of the benefit and the responses of consumers, providers, and health plans, such an a pproach could but would not necessarily increase the costs borne by beneficiaries. A re \u0010 lated approach would be to stimulate private health plans to compete through premiums to a greater extent than they do under current policies. Under competition, en \u0010 rollees could have the incentive to join the health plans that provided benefits at the lowest cost while maintain \u0010 ing acceptable quality. Another possibility for lowering Medicare's costs per eligible person would be reducing payments to providers. All of the approaches discussed in this chapter would lower total spending below the level to which it would rise under current policies, but most of the approaches would not change the rate of growth over time. For ex \u0010 ample, reducing the number of people eligible for Medi \u0010 care would decrease spending by the amount that those people would have cost the program each year, but the rate of increase in spending for the remaining Medicare population would still be driven by the same factors as before\u2014population growth and per capita increases in spending. However, some approaches, such as introduc \u0010 ing more competition, would have the potential to slow growth if they changed incentives for health plans, pro \u0010 viders, and enrollees to encourage them to use less\u2014or less expensive\u2014health care. As in the Medicare program, federal expenditures for Medicaid will grow significantly after the baby boomers reach retirement age. Medicaid is a federal/state program that, like Medicare, provides health coverage to a target population that includes Medicare enrollees who are poor or have medical costs that consume much of their in \u0010 come. Certain Medicare beneficiaries who are very poor or who spend a significant portion of their income on medical care qualify for fu ll Medicaid coverage, which provides not only payments for Medicare premiums and cost sharing but also services not covered by Medicare, such as prescription drugs and long \u0010term care. Other poor Medicare beneficiaries with somewhat higher in \u0010 come have more limited Medicaid benefits, consisting of payments to cover Medicare premiums and cost sharing or the premiums only.This chapter does not provide options to constrain Medicaid spending, but several options for the program appear in Chapter 2. Because many opportunities for cost cutting lie with the states, which have primary manage \u0010 ment responsibility for Medicaid and considerable discre \u0010 tion in tailoring their Medicaid plans, federal policies for reducing Medicaid spending are limited primarily to reducing the federal contribution to the program and restricting the coverage options available to the states. Both are approaches that have encountered strong resis \u0010 tance from state governments. Another option would convert to a block grant supplemental payments to hospi \u0010 tals that serve large numbers of the poor and uninsured.13 Over the past decade, many states have expanded eligi \u0010 bility for Medicaid and benefits far beyond federally man \u0010 dated levels. In a climate of cost reduction, states could reduce rates for payments to providers, cut back on eligi \u0010 bility standards, trim enrollment through decreased out \u0010 reach, and reduce the scope of benefits provided under the program. States could also increase cost sharing for Medicaid beneficiar ies, but only to a modest extent be \u0010 cause of federal limits. In any case, given the income lev \u0010 els of Medicaid beneficiaries, the potential savings from increasing cost sharing are modest at best. ( See Box 4\u00102.) Background on Medicare Medicare provides federal health insurance for 40 million people who are aged or disabled or who have end \u0010stage renal disease. Part A of Medicare, or Hospital Insurance (HI), covers inpatient services provided by hospitals as well as skilled nursing, home health, and hospice care. Part B, or Supplementary Medical Insurance (SMI), cov \u0010 ers services provided by physicians, tioners (such as chiropractors and podiatrists), hospitals' outpatient departments, home health agencies, and sup \u0010 pliers of medical equipment. Everyone who is eligible for Social Security benefits on the basis of age or disability is ultimately eligible for Medicare as well. For early retirees, eligibility for Medi \u0010 care is delayed until age 65. Similarly, after they become eligible for Social Security, disabled enrollees must wait two years to become eligible for Medicare. In addition, 13. See option 550 \u001005.264 BUDGET OPTIONS Box 4-2. Medicaid and Long-Term Care As with the Medicare program, federal expenditures for Medicaid are projected to grow significantly as the baby boomers begin reaching age 65 in 2011, but the most significant growth for the Medicaid program will probably materializ e around 2030\u2014when baby boomers begin to join the ranks of the \"oldest old\" (those age 85 or older) and many of them begin to need long \u0010term care services.1 The potentially large future demand for long \u0010term care services poses a major challenge for federal policymakers and for the economy. Spending from all sources for nursing home and home \u0010based services for seniors is expected to exceed $120 billion in 2002 (s ee the table). Increasing costs are driven by both the growing number of senior citizens and higher cost s for care. By 2040, spending on long\u0010term care is projected to reach $346 billion (in 2000 dollars), or 1.5 percent of gross domestic product (GDP), up from 1.2 percent of GDP in 2002. The Use of Long-Term Care Services by the Elderly Long\u0010term care comprises a variety of medical and social services for elderly and disabled people whose disabilities prevent them from living independently. Formal long \u0010term care services may be provided in the home or community or in institutions for those who can no longer remain in their homes. Not all people who could use such services receive them, however, because formal services are costly and may be less de \u0010 sirable than informal help from family and friends. Indeed, the most important sources of assistance for disabled elderly people who remain in the community are live\u0010in caregivers and networks of family helpers. 1. While a significant number of people under age 65 are disabled and consume long \u0010term care services, the bulk of such care goes to the elderly.Long-Term Care Expenditures for the Elderly, by Source of Payment, 2002 (In billions of dollars) Institu- tional CareHome CareAll Long- Term Care Third-Party Payers Medicaid 34.8 7.0 41.9Medicare 13.5 15.2 28.7Private insurance 2.5 3.7 6.2 Out-of-Pocket Payments 33.5 5.7 39.2 Other 1.2 3.6 4.8 Total 85.5 35.2 120.8 Source: Congressional Budget Office based on data fr om the national health accounts, the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey, the MedicalExpenditure Panel Survey, and the Centers for Medicare and Medic-aid Services and from the long-term care financing model preparedby the Lewin Group for the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Eval- uation of the Department of Health and Human Services. Despite recent rapid growth in spending for long \u0010term care, most services are still provided informally and are not, therefore, represented in the data on expenditures. In 1999, about 6.6 million seniors (or about 19 percent of the elderly population) required assistance because of physical or cognitive impairments. Of that number, 1.7 million were in nursing homes, and 1 million were severely disabled but sti ll living in the community, although they probably would have qualified for ad \u0010 mission to a nursing home. The remainder were less severely disabled but still potential users of long \u0010term care services.CHAPTER FOUR SLOWING THE LONG-TERM GROWTH OF SOCIAL SECURITY AND MEDICARE 265 Box 4-2. Continued Over the next 30 years or so, the elderly population will double, a level of growth that is also foreseen for the \"oldest old\" population, which of course is made up of people who are more likely to have disabilities that make them depend on others for assistance. In 2030, the number of senior s who are disabled is projected to be more than 12 million. Although the prevalence of disability among the elderly appears to be on the decline, the large increase in the number of people age 85 or older will more than offset that favorable trend. Those estimates are quite specula \u0010 tive, however, because of the uncertainty that sur \u0010 rounds future rates of disability and longevity among the elderly. Another uncertainty affecting the future demand for formal long \u0010term care services is whether or not in \u0010 formal caregivers will continue to provide as muchcare as they do now. Financing Long-Term Care for the Elderly The future growth of spending on long \u0010term care for the elderly has major significance for the federal budget as well as the overall economy. Medicare and Medicaid, the two largest public financing programs, paid for more than half of nursing home and home care expenditures for th e elderly in 2002. Medicare pays primarily for medical treatment for acute healthproblems but has become a de facto provider of long\u0010term care through its coverage of home health care and services in skilled nursing facilities. Al \u0010 though that coverage was originally intended to meet the short\u0010term needs, Medicare's hom e health bene \u0010 fit is increasingly important for chronic care pa \u0010 tients. During the latter part of the 1990s, Medicare spending for home health care fell in response toseveral factors, including changes in the reimbursement methodology and a crackdown on fraud and abuse, but such spending resumed it s steady growth in 2000. The federal government is the principal payer of formal long\u0010term care services for the elderly. That financing role steadily expanded in th e 1990s as a result, in part, of a rapid rise in Medicare spending for skilled nursing facilities and home health services. In 2002, the federal government accounted for about 45 percent of allspending on nursing home and home care for the el \u0010 derly and about 75 percent of the public expendituresfor those services. By contrast, the role of private insurance in financing long\u0010term care is small, though growing; in 2002 it accounted for about 5 percent of all spending on nurs \u0010 ing home and home care for the elderly. 2 Less than 10 percent of seniors have private long \u0010term care insur \u0010 ance, but employers, including the federal government, are increasingly facilitating such coverage as an em \u0010 ployee benefit. However, employees typically must paythe total premium. Without a major expansion of the market for private long \u0010term care insurance, the federal government's responsibility for financing long \u0010term care is likely to continue to grow. Yet the use of such services would probably rise significantly if a large per \u0010 centage of the population had long \u0010term insurance\u2014 especially if those policies covered in \u0010home services. 2. Payments by private insuranc e may be underreported because most insurers reimburse policyho lders for costs that they have already incurred and paid, rather than paying providers of ser \u0010 vices directly. As a result, those payments by insurers may be re \u0010 ported as out \u0010of\u0010pocket spending rather than as spending by pri \u0010 vate insurance.266 BUDGET OPTIONS people who are 65 or older and not eligible for Social S e c u r i t y b e n e f i t s m a y e n r o l l i n M e d i c a r e b y p a y i n g premiums. In total, 96 percent of the U.S. population age 65 or older is enro lled in Part A; 92 percent is enrolled in Part B. Hospital Insurance benefits are financed primarily from current workers' payroll taxes. Supplementary Medical Insurance is financed from two sources: 25 percent comes from enrollees who pay premiums, and 75 percent comes from general revenues. Medicare requires enrollees to pay part of the cost of most covered services through various arrangements and to various degrees. Inpatient hospital stays, for example, require patients to first pay a deductible ( $840 per benefit period in 2003) and then pa y additional daily copay \u0010 ments if they have more than 60 days of care. Part B services require a $100 deductible per ye ar. For physician and other medical services, patients generally pay 20 per \u0010 cent of the Medicare \u0010approved amount after they meet the deductible. Some services require no cost sharing, namely, laboratory, home heal th, and selected preventive services. The federal government and state governments incur additional health care cost s for the Medicare population through Medicaid. Because of the overlap in coverage between Medicare and Medicaid, efforts to control Medi \u0010 care spending generally will affect Medicaid spending; the magnitude and direction of the effect, however, will de \u0010 pend on the specifics of each proposal. For example, in \u0010 creasing Medicare's cost \u0010sharing requirements would raise Medicaid spending, but lowering Medicare's payments to providers would lower Medicaid spending. Other governmental and private entities also incur health care costs for Medicare enrollees. Government benefits programs, available through the Federal Employees Health Benefits program and the Departments of De \u0010 fense and Veterans Affairs, for example, provide health care coverage or services to eligible enrollees.14 Approxi\u0010mately 33 percent of Medicare enrollees have supplemen \u0010 tal coverage provided by a former employer or union. Another 23 percent of Medicare enrollees pay for individ \u0010 ual supplemental insurance, or medigap. Such supple \u0010 mental coverage typically pays for much of Medicare's cost sharing and occasionally for some items that Medi \u0010 care does not cover, such as prescription drugs. As described, most Medicare enrollees receive their care through a fee \u0010for\u0010service system. But 12 percent receive their care through private health plans (usually HMOs [health maintenance organizations]) that agree to take on the insurance risk for all Medicare benefits in exchange for a predetermined monthly payment. Operating under the Medicare+Choice (M+C) program, all plans receive payments that are based in part on historical costs in the fee\u0010for\u0010service sector, but they are guaranteed a minimum (floor) payment. If a plan's cost of providing Medicare benefits is less than the capitated payment it receives, it must return all of the excess to enrollees by covering additional benefits or by providing a rebate (which is limited to the amount of the Part B premium). M+C plans have typically offered enrollees lower cost sharing than that required under the fee \u0010for\u0010service system and often have enhanced the benefit package to include ser \u0010 vices that Medicare does not cover. Approaches and Illustrative Options for Slowing the Growth of Medicare Spending Two broad approaches could slow the growth in federal spending for Medicare: reducing the number of people who are eligible for benefits or reducing the costs per enrollee. Within those two approaches, the illustrative options discussed in this chapter could be combined to generate even more savings. All of the options involve difficult choices and political challenges. Reducing the number of people who are eli \u0010 gible or reducing the government's costs per enrollee by increasing the share of costs paid by enrollees would shift costs from the Medicare program to those people who 14. Under the Department of Defe nse's TRICARE for Life program, created in 2000, eligible people age 65 or older receive generouscoverage of cost \u0010sharing amounts within the Medicare program,as well as coverage of prescription drugs. Because that supplemental coverage insulates enrollees from ha ving to pay for any of the costs of services, Medicare spending for this population tends to be rela \u0010 tively high.CHAPTER FOUR SLOWING THE LONG-TERM GROWTH OF SOCIAL SECURITY AND MEDICARE 267 had lost their coverage or to enrollees (or to the govern \u0010 ment programs or insurance companies that paid the cost sharing for them). Reducing costs through competition offers the potential for savings through greater efficiency, though beneficiaries who do not wish to join private health plans might face higher premiums than those to which they have been accustomed. The timing of changes to the program is important from both a budgetary and a policy perspective. The longer legislators postpone changes designed to slow spending, the lower the impact that those changes will have on total spending over time. As with changes to Social Security, equity and efficiency argue for announcing any changes long before they take effect so that people have m ore tim e to plan and adjust to the changes. Reduce the Number of Enrollees by Raising the Age of Eligibility . The number of people who are eligible for Medicare could be reduced by gradually raising the age of eligibility, as two options presented here show. The first would gradually increase the age of eligibility for Medicare from 65 to 67 by 2026, to be consistent with currently scheduled increases in the normal retirement age for Social Security benefits. Although the gradual in \u0010 crease has already begun in the Social Security program, this option assumes that the increase in the age of eligi \u0010 bility for Medicare would not start until 2015, to allow people who are currently nearing retirement the time to plan and adjust. Beginning in 2015, the eligibility age would increase by two months every year until it reached 67 in 2026, where it would re main in future years. The second option assumes that the eligibility age would increase by two months ev ery year beginning in 2015 until it reached 70 in 2044, wh ere it would remain. This option is analogous to the one that would raise the normal retirement age for Social Security (described earlier in this chapter), but it would be phased in more slowly and would not raise the eligibility age above 70. According to CBO's estimates, the first option, once it was fully in place, would reduce Medicare's enrollment by about 7 percent and net sp ending by about 3 percent a year, compared with what they would be under current policies. Spending is projected to fall by less than enroll \u0010 ment is because people who are 65 or 66 are typically theleast costly enrollees. By 2075, the reduction in net spending for Medicare wou ld be about 0.3 percent of GDP. The second option, once it was fully in place, would reduce Medicare's enrollment by about 17 percent and net spending by about 9 percent a year. By 2075, the reduction in net spending for Medicare would be about 0.7 percent of GDP. The reduced spending for Me dicare would be partially offset by increased spending under Medicaid and the Fed \u0010 eral Employees Health Benefits program \u2014both of which would have to pick up part of the health care costs of their beneficiaries whose eligibility for Medicare had been delayed.15 However, spending would be reduced for the military's TRICARE for Life program, because eligibility for that program is limited to people who are enrolled in Medicare. The effects of raising the Medicare eligibility age on federal spending for these three programs through 2075 are not estimated here. Ho wever, to provide an in \u0010 dication of the likely effects, CBO estimates that raising the Medicare eligibility ag e to 67 or to 70 by 2013 would result in an increase in the combined spending for those three programs equal to about 13 percent to 14 percent of the savings for Medicare. Although raising the age of eligibility would reduce Medicare spending, it would do little to reduce total health care costs for those eligible for Medicare under current law. Further, it would lengthen the period of time during which those opting for early retirement under Social Security (at age 62) might have difficulty getting insurance coverage. That disadvantage could be lessened by coupling this approach with an option under which early retirees could buy Medicare coverage by paying an actuarially fair premium. Such coverage would be costly, however, and designing it so that it was budget neutral would be difficult because of the need to account for the fact that the people who participated would be expected 15. Raising the eligibility age would also increase state spending for Medicaid because about 17 percent of Medicare enrollees receiveMedicaid benefits as well.268 BUDGET OPTIONS to have a greater dem and for medical care than those who did not participate.16 Increasing Medicare's eligibility age would shift costs that are now paid by Medicare to enrollees and to employers. The higher costs to employers might reduce the number of them who offered health benefits to retirees, thereby accelerating a current trend. Another effect might be to increase the number of applications for disability from the affected population, which would reduce the savings that Medicare would otherwise realize; that effect is not estimated here. Decrease Medicare's Costs per Person by Raising Monthly Premiums . One way to decrease Medicare's costs per person would be to increase enrollees' premiums(see options 570 \u001012 and 570 \u001013 in Chapter 2). Premi \u0010 ums paid by Medicare's SMI enrollees now cover about25 percent of the average benefits paid through that pro \u0010 gram, although the premiums were intended to cover 50percent of the costs for SMI when Medicare was first established. Increasing collections from all enrollees to cover that percentage would reduce net Medicare spend \u0010 ing by about 12 percent, or 1.0 percent of GDP, in 2075. If premiums were higher for all enrollees, the increasecould impose a financial hardship on lower \u0010income en \u0010 rollees who were not eligible for Medicaid. In addition,it would raise Medicaid's costs for Medicare enrollees who were also receiving Medicaid benefits, since Medic \u0010 aid pays the Medicare premiums for those people. Theresulting increases in federal spending for Medicaid would offset the net savings for Medicare by less than 0.1 percent of GDP. Another likely consequence would be lower participation in Part B by people with alternative coverage, including coverage through federal programs like the Federal Employees Health Benefits program, andthus higher costs in those programs. Such costs are not estimated here. One alternative would vary the amounts that Medicare collected from enrollees on the basis of their financial re \u0010 sources (necessitating a process for determining enrollees' income). For example, premiums could be higher for enrollees with the highest income and the same as they are under current law for all other enrollees. Under the option presented here, individuals with an adjusted gross income of less than $50,000 (in 2003 dollars) would pay the Part B premiums now prescribed by law. For higher \u0010 income people, premiums would rise, reaching a maxi \u0010 mum of twice the current premiums for individuals withan adjusted gross income of more than $100,000. 17 Those thresholds would be adjusted over time to hold the pro \u0010 portions of beneficiaries constant. This alternative would reduce net Medica re spending by about 0.1 percent of GDP by 2075. A result would be higher implicit mar \u0010 ginal tax rates for Medicare enrollees due to phasing out the subsidy for higher \u0010income enrollees. The premiums that Medicare enrollees now pay average about 2 percent of their income and are projected to rise to nearly 6 percent on aver age by 2075. If premiums rose to cover 50 percent of SMI costs, Medicare premiums onaverage would amount to about 12 percent of enrollees' income by 2075. Under the op tion in which premiums would be higher only for the wealthiest individuals,premiums on average would be about 7 percent of enroll \u0010 ees' income by 2075. Those c osts for enrollees could be reduced only if the growth in health care costs slowed to a greater extent than the projections assume. Increasing premiums would reduce net federal spending for Medicare but only by shifting more costs to enrollees or their secondary payers. It would do little or nothing to lower beneficiaries' use of health care. Decrease Medicare's Costs per Enrollee by Raising Cost Sharing for Services . Another way to increase the portion of costs that enrollees pay would be to raise costsharing for services (see options 570 \u001014, 570\u001015, 570\u001016,16. Because of that anticipated \"adve rse selection,\" the Clinton Admin \u0010 istration's proposal to allow people ages 62 to 64 to buy into Medi \u0010 care called for a two \u0010part premium. Before age 65, enrollees would have paid premiums that reflec ted the average expected cost of benefits if everyone ages 62 to 64 had participated in the buy \u0010in. At age 65 and thereafter, participants would have paid a surcharge (in addition to the regular Medica re premiums) to account for the government's extra costs resulting from adverse selection in thebuy\u0010in program. 17. The adjusted gross income thresholds for couples would be $75,000 and $150,000 (in 2003 dollars).CHAPTER FOUR SLOWING THE LONG-TERM GROWTH OF SOCIAL SECURITY AND MEDICARE 269 570\u001017, 570\u001018, and 570 \u001020 in Chapter 2) . Raising cost sharing would both lower Medicare spending directly and make enrollees more sensitive to the costs of health ser \u0010 vices and thus more judicious in seeking those services. Increased cost sharing (as well as higher premiums for enrollees) has become more prevalent in the design of private\u0010sector plans over the past several years, as insurers try to limit premium increases for purchasers. Studies have found that higher cost sharing generally reduces the use of services with little effect on health outcomes, with the notable exception of patients with low income and certain health conditions.18 Cost sharing could increase in a number of ways to sup \u0010 port a variety of policy goals. For example, increases could be targeted toward services that are used relatively frequently at enrollees' election, such as doctor's visits. Or greater cost sharing coul d be more br oadly applied, such as through higher deductibles, regardless of the type of services used. Copayments\u2014fixed dollar payments per service\u2014have the advantage of giving Medicare enrollees a predictable amount of cost sharing, while coinsurance \u2014a fixed percentage of a bill\u2014sends a clearer price signal about the relative costliness of providers (to the extent that fees are permitted to vary). Private \u0010sector plans are experimenting with ways to simultaneously raise cost sharing and send clearer price signals about the costs of different health care providers.19 Although, in principle, cost \u0010sharing requirements can encourage enrollees to be more prudent consumers of health care, that effect is likely to be weak in the Medicare program because so many people have supplemental coverage that pays for cost sharing. Consequently, they would not directly experience the higher costs. The resultwould be primarily a shift in costs rather than a reduction in the use of services. To be effective at deterring the use of services, such a policy would need to be combined with rules that limited supplemental coverage. Medicaid pays cost sharing for most Medicare enrollees who are also eligible for Medicaid, although states may require enrollees to pay nominal cost \u0010sharing amounts. Thus, increases in cost sharing for Medicaid enrollees would only shift costs to the states rather than reduce total spending. Medigap plans typically cover most of Medicare's cost sharing. If Medicare increased cost sharing and medigap plans could pick up the additional amounts, enrollees would pay for the increases in higher medigap premiums rather than through higher out \u0010of\u0010pocket spending when they were deciding whether or not to use health services. For that reason, medigap supplemental coverage would dampen the savings from higher cost sharing. Other types of supplemental Medicare coverage pose a similar constraint on the effectiveness of increasing cost sharing. Medicare HMOs and employer \u0010based plans typically have lower cost \u0010sharing requirements than Medicare has. However, both types of supplemental cov \u0010 erage have increased cost sharing in recent years.20 Short of increasing Medicare's cost sharing requirements, changes to medigap alone that would expose enrollees to at least some of Medicare's existing cost sharing would generate savings. Enrollees would likely lower their use of some discretionary services if they had to pay more for them. Even greater savings would be realized by prohibit \u0010 ing all private supplemental insurers from paying for Medicare cost sharing. 18. Robert H.

Restructuring the Medicare market to introduce greater competition could reduce costs per enrollee. The option presented here would set up a system in which plans would compete for enrollees on the basis of premiums and other attributes such as quality of care and customer service. The system would include private plans such as HMOs and preferred provider organizations as well as providers in Medicare's traditional fee \u0010for\u0010service sector. But Medicare's pay \u0010 ments would be determined through competitive market forces rather than through administered pricing. Further \u0010 more, unlike arrangements under the current M+C pay \u0010 ment system, Medicare would capture some of the sav \u0010 ings if private plans provided Medicare benefits more efficiently than the fee \u0010for\u0010service sector did. In 1999, the Bipartisan Co mmission on the Future of Medicare developed a proposal for reform based on com \u0010 petition, but the proposal did not receive enough votes among the commission's members for it to be presented as a formal recommendation to the President and the Congress. Subsequently, some members of the commis \u0010 sion introduced a bill, S. 357, based on the commission's proposal. Other proposals for reforming Medicare through competition (which differ in important ways from S. 357) include the Cl inton Administration's pro \u0010 posal, a proposal passed by the House in 2002 (H.R. 4954), and a bill introduced in the Senate in 2001 (S. 358). In the option presented here, all participating plans would be required to offer a standard benefit package. Medicare would make a contribution toward the premi \u0010 ums of each plan up to a maximum amount, called the reference premium, or benchmark. Plans' premiums and perhaps the benchmark as well would be determined through competitive bidding. Beneficiaries would be required to pay premiums above the benchmark and would receive rebates for enrolling in less expensive plans. Plans would be permitted to offer supplemental benefits for which beneficiaries would pay an additional premium. Such a competitive bidding system could reduce Medi \u0010 care's costs by altering the incentives facing both benefi \u0010 ciaries and plans. Requiring beneficiaries to pay higher premiums for enrolling in more expensive plans wouldencourage them to be more cost \u0010conscious in their selec \u0010 tion. Competitive forces would therefore encourage plans to keep premiums low. But whether or not a restructured market produced sig \u0010 nificant savings for Medicare would depend on how it was designed and on how beneficiaries and plans re \u0010 sponded. A key design decision would be how to set the benchmark. One approach wo uld be to base the bench \u0010 mark on the bids submitted by plans, with the bids from all plans treated on an equal basis. For example, the benchmark could be set to equal the minimum or average bid in a market area or the national average bid, which would include the average cost in the fee \u0010for\u0010service sector. A second approach would be to set the benchmark to equal the average cost in that sector. This approach would give special status to the fee \u0010for\u0010service sector and would guarantee that beneficiaries in that sector would never pay higher premiums than the Part B premiums\u2014even if the care in that sector was the most expensive option avail \u0010 able. The approach would therefore have less potential for reducing Medicare spending. A third approach would be to set the benchmark inde \u0010 pendently of the actual costs of health plans, initially on the basis of a budgetary target, and then to update it by a predetermined amount (for example, the annual growth in per capita GDP). Medicare could be certain of con \u0010 trolling its spending under this approach because the financial risks posed by the growth in health care costs would shift to plans\u2014and ultimately to beneficiaries through premiums. However, if health care costs grew faster than the annual update in the defined contribution, beneficiaries could face very large increases in their premi \u0010 ums. This approach is analogous to the defined \u0010contribu\u0010 tion approach that some employers are considering. The effects of a competitive bidding system on Medicare spending would also depend on whether private plans could provide Medicare benefits more efficiently than the fee\u0010for\u0010service sector could and on whether those differ \u0010 ences in efficiency were revealed through plans' bids. There is evidence that HMOs provide care at a lower total cost than do other types of plans because those or \u0010 ganizations use hospital services and other expensiveCHAPTER FOUR SLOWING THE LONG-TERM GROWTH OF SOCIAL SECURITY AND MEDICARE 271 resources less. However, in recent years, in response to a backlash from consumers, some plans have eased their restrictions on care, and providers have gained greater leverage with HMOs in their contract negotiations. Those circumstances suggest that the cost advantages en \u0010 joyed in the past by HMOs have diminished, at least temporarily. Beneficiaries' preferences\u2014and particularly their willing \u0010 ness to switch plans in response to differences in premi \u0010 ums\u2014would also play an important role in determining whether a competitive bidding system significantly re \u0010 duced Medicare spending. Plans would be more likely to bid aggressively if doing so enabled them to capture a substantial share of the market. The limited evidence on the price responsiveness of Medicare beneficiaries suggests that they respond much less to differences in premiums than people under 65 do, but additional research on the topic is needed to draw definitive conclusions. Implementing a competitive bidding system would pose many challenges. First, the payment system would have to include an effective mechanism to compensate for the fact that some plans would be likely to attract enrollees who were healthier than aver age, while others would be likely to attract enrollees with below \u0010average health. An effective risk adjustor would pay plans fairly for the people they enrolled and would minimize the chance that plans would try to compete on their ability to attract en \u0010 rollees who were \"good risks.\"21 Another challenge would be educating beneficiaries about the new system and about the costs and quality of the available health plans. In addition, it would be necessary to determine whether and how benchmarks should reflect geographic variations in Medicare's costs, which reflect differences in utilization as well as prices and other factors. Finally, a method for setting the government's contributions in geographic areas with few competing plans would be needed.All in all, the effect of a competitive bidding system on Medicare spending is highly uncertain because of ques \u0010 tions about how plans and beneficiaries would respond. Presumably, a properly designed competitive system would lead to greater efficiency and reduced spending. However, there is insufficient evidence to predict with confidence the magnitude of any reduction in spending. For example, it is not known how the bids of private plans would compare with average spending in the fee \u0010 for\u0010service sector and whether vigorous competition would emerge in many geographic areas. Moreover, there is great uncertainty about whether, after being fully im \u0010 plemented, a competitive system would reduce the level of Medicare spending per enrollee and whether the long \u0010 term growth of spending per enrollee would be reduced as well. If the competitive system reduced Medicare spending per enrollee by 5 percent but did not change the growth in spending per enrollee, in 2075 net spending on Medicare would be reduced by ab out 0.4 percent of GDP. However, if the competitive system initially reduced spending by 5 percent and also reduced the growth in spending per enrollee from the projected 5.4 percent a year to, say, 5.0 percent a year, in 2075 net Medicare spending would be reduced by about 2.0 percent of GDP \u2014illustrating the power of compounding over a long period even when a policy option reduces the growth in spending by only a modest amount. The proportion of the savings that would come from lower payments to plans versus higher premiums paid by beneficiaries would depend on the design of the competitive system and the willingness of beneficiaries to switch plans in response to differences in premiums. Reduce per Capita Spending Using Other Strategies . Other approaches for reducing Medicare spending that affect aspects of the current fee \u0010for\u0010service program in \u0010 clude reducing payments to providers and introducing coverage of disease or case management\u2014programs that coordinate care among providers, ensure that patients comply with their treatment regimens, and encourage health care providers to adhere to evidence \u0010based guide \u0010 lines. Reduce Provider Payments . Over Medicare's history, the Congress often has changed payments to health care21. Medicare will implement a new risk adjustor for managed care plans that will incorporate information on the health status of en \u0010 rollees derived from their previous encounters with the health caresystem. Although the new risk adjustor is expected to be a signifi \u0010 cant improvement over the current one, whether or not it will beadequate is unknown.272 BUDGET OPTIONS providers to slow the growth in per capita spending\u2014 often lowering the increase, or update, to the annual pay \u0010 ment rate that would have otherwise applied (see options 570\u001007, 570\u001008, and 570 \u001019 in Chapter 2) . That sort of strategy might be effective in generating savings in the short run but would do little to address the underlying sources of spending growth. Further, such changes would tend not to be sustainable, since formulas for updates are based on increases in providers' costs. If payments did not keep pace with overall cost increases, reducing provider payments could restrict Me dicare enrollees' access to health care: because Medicare limits the amount that providers may charge enrollees over and above the pro \u0010 gram's payment rate, if the total amount that providers were allowed to charge was below their marginal cost of providing services, they could restrict Medicare patients' access to care. Introduce Disease Management and Case Management . Pro\u0010 ponents of disease management and case management claim that adding those benefits to Medicare will improve the quality of care that enrollees receive and lower federal costs at the same time. Because Medicare's expenditures are concentrated among a small number of high \u0010cost enrollees (for whom expenditures often persist over time), savings could come from preventing the use of expensive services by better coordinating existing resources or using preventive care. For example, a disease management pro \u0010 gram for patients with diabetes could ensure that enroll \u0010 ees received recommended foot and eye exams annually. By detecting problems earlier, such steps could prevent more\u0010expensive treatments, such as hospitalization or surgery. But whether or not disease management or case manage \u0010 ment can improve health outcomes, much less produce long\u0010term savings, is not yet known.22 The industry has developed programs that claim to improve the quality of care and to reduce costs, but the limited number of studies available and the methodological issues that theypresent raise questions about those claims. Even if disease management and case management programs were found to save money, determining how the programs applied within Medicare would still be necessary. Table 4-3.

However, none of the op \u0010 tions for which CBO developed long \u0010range estimates would reduce the growth in spending by enough to prevent Medicare outlays from consuming a significantly higher share of GDP once the baby \u0010boom generation retired. Among the options for which long \u0010range esti\u0010 mates were presented, doubling the Part B premiumswould achieve the largest savings, reducing net Medicare spending by 1.0 percent of GDP by 2075. However, net Medicare spending would still increase significantly under that option\u2014from 2.1 percent of GDP today to 7.2 percent in 2075 ( see Table 4 \u00103). Increasing the eligi \u0010 bility age for Medicare to 70 would achieve smaller sav \u0010 ings, reducing projected ne t Medicare spending in 2075 by 0.7 percent of GDP. Maki ng inroads that would be significant enough to change the long \u0010term outlook for Medicare could require a combination of approaches.Contributors to This Volume All divisions of the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) contributed to this report, which was coordinated by Arlene Holen.
