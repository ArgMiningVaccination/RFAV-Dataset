Mayo Clinic immunization guidelines are based on the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommendations for healthcare workers](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/adults/rec-vac/hcw.html) and are in alignment with the [AAMC standardized immunization requirements](https://www.aamc.org/professional-development/affinity-groups/gsa/cosr/immunization-form). Accepted and waitlisted learners will receive the required attestation forms as admissions offers begin at Mayo Clinic Alix School of Medicine. Students must submit completed attestation forms signed by an NP/PA/MD/DO as well as copies of all immunization records and any applicable lab reports indicating immunity. Full immunity from vaccination takes time, so even if you ultimately choose a different medical school, it is recommended you start your immunization review as soon as possible. If you have questions about these requirements, please email [mccmadmissions@mayo.edu](mailto:mccmadmissions@mayo.edu). Vaccination attestation Mandatory vaccines with no declination possible The below vaccines are mandatory with no declination possible.

Please be aware there are two types of lab tests of immunity. Qualitative immunity shows result as either positive or negative.

For students with a history of a prior positive TB skin test (>10mm), a blood test is required. If a blood test is positive, documentation of a chest X-ray and any treatment received is required.
