However, every inch of shelf space in the skincare aisle is hotly fought-after, and the fledgeling [clean beauty industry](https://www.vogue.in/content/these-natural-skincare-brands-are-making-clean-beauty-the-new-cool) can often find it hard to compete with the accessible price bracket of mass-produced, machine-made products. So, what makes it worth your while to pay the difference by upgrading to clean beauty and what exactly is driving up costs, to begin with? We went looking for answers, and here's what we learned. What is clean beauty? For Victoria Fu, one half of the popular Instagram account Chemist Confessions, the conventional meaning of clean beauty is devoid of certain [\"no-no\" ingredients](https://www.vogue.in/beauty/content/mineral-oils-in-skincare-products-all-you-need-to-know-about-this-much-debated-beauty-ingredient) that are deemed harmful to humans or the environment. She says, \"Our definition of clean beauty is a responsible formulation that is able to marry the best natural and synthetic ingredients and hold up to the highest standards of quality and safety. Skincare users, more than ever before, are paying attention to more than just pretty packaging and marketing claims. We believe this movement will force the industry to make better products and choices.\" Closer home, industry insiders believe that the definition of clean beauty coincides with the ancient wisdom of Ayurveda. Neha Rawla, head of brand communications for Forest Essentials, elaborates, \"In ancient Ayurvedic scriptures, skincare practices were subtly interwoven with the seasons. Furthermore, it does not advocate chemical fertilisers or ingredients grown out of season. They also don't leave a harmful footprint on the planet, particularly the soil, water, and air. While the definition of clean beauty is different across the industry, for us, the [Ayurvedic standard for beauty](https://www.vogue.in/beauty/content/common-mistakes-while-trying-ayurvedic-skincare-and-health-tips) has always been pure, fresh, seasonal and natural.\" Understanding the pricing of clean beauty Since the industry serves as a consumer-driven market, Rawla believes that the future is bright for clean beauty in the post-COVID world. \"Consumers are [rethinking and re-prioritising their consumption patterns](https://www.vogue.in/fashion/content/the-rise-and-rise-of-the-modern-ethical-consumer) to make them less conspicuous and more responsible towards society as well as the environment. There is an increased desire for transparency from brands, so consumers can seek out brands that align with their personal values,\" she says. However, if clean beauty is to ever make the transition from a trending buzzword to industry standard, there are a few mountains to climb along the way\u2014pricing can often serve as a make-or-break factor for everyday consumers. If you've been looking for further incentives to make the switch to a cleaner and safer standard of skincare, we asked the experts to break down exactly what goes into the pricing of a clean beauty product\u2014and why it's worth making the change. While clean beauty ingredients may not drive the same demand as their conventional counterparts, Siddharth Somaiya, founder of clean beauty brand Organic Riot, believes that lack of consumer demand is not the only factor driving up product pricing. \"We have gotten used to buying junk, which is why there is a misconception that clean beauty is expensive in comparison. But the fact is that when you're buying from smaller farms who don't have as much scale as large industrial farms, the [pricing for its raw materials](https://www.vogue.in/fashion/content/5-ways-the-fashion-industry-can-achieve-a-greener-future) will always be more expensive. It is important to remember that when you're buying safe skincare, we are buying from people who are foregoing a lot of profitability in order to provide quality products, in terms of harvesting and extraction methods,\" he explains. \"There can be a much longer [research and development timeline](https://www.vogue.in/beauty/content/the-new-rules-for-building-a-beauty-brand-in-2020) involved, especially if a brand is trying to create a clean version of an existing product. This can contribute to a higher overall price point,\" adds Fu. The notion is seconded by cosmetic chemist Ginger King. \"It's more about getting rid of the 'bad' guys and keeping the existing good ones, while also coming out with new ingredients that are clean to start with,\" she believes. As the author of How To Start Your Own Cosmetic Line: The Brutally Honest Truth From A Cosmetic Chemist, King can also confirm that part of the cost can be attributed to the need for preservation of formulas after manufacturing. \"In the pre-clean days, active ingredients were often preserved with [parabens](https://www.vogue.in/beauty/content/the-truth-about-the-ingredients-in-your-favourite-bottle-of-shampoo-haircare) and propylene glycol. Now, neither of these class of materials are clean and this has called for a change in the manufacturing of raw materials, which has since trickled down to the cost of the formulas,\" she explains. In a bid to dial down the impact on the environment, the world of clean beauty has been increasingly adopting recycled, sustainable packaging, which eventually plays its part in the bottom line. Gloria Lu, co-founder of Chemist Confessions, says, \" [Skincare packaging](https://www.vogue.in/beauty/content/recycling-beauty-packaging-challenges) is a big cost component in general, and it is even more so if it is recyclable or sustainable. However, we think advances in sustainable packaging are one of the most exciting developments in the over-arching clean movement. We can foresee the cost of sustainable packaging coming down in the next few years due to increased demand.\" The clean beauty movement often coincides with the slow beauty ethos which prizes batch-made production processes. Rawla affirms, \"We subscribe to an age-old method of fermentation our traditional fruit scrub, wherein ingredients are mixed in earthenware pots and buried beneath the shade of banyan trees. These [methods are sustainable](https://www.vogue.in/culture-and-living/content/35-things-you-can-do-to-help-save-the-planet-in-2021), but painstaking and labour-intensive, leading to higher costs than machine-produced products.\" Ultimately, Fu believes that the pricing of clean beauty products is dependent on multiple variables, which means that the process is not necessarily straightforward. \"If there's a huge demand for clean beauty, we might see brands taking on the challenge of coming up with a price-friendly line. At the end of the day, it's a complicated equation that ties together market demand, brand marketing, supply chain and product development.\" Why it's worth making the switch to clean beauty While Fu advocates the switch to clean beauty as a worthy cost if it aligns with your personal moral compass, for every one person that makes the switch, the industry benefits as a whole. \"With more people adopting clean beauty, sustainable packaging will become more mainstream and, ultimately, more cost-effective for all brands if you, the consumer, show that you care,\" she says. The good news is that a mindful future might be here sooner than expected with a global shift towards conscious consumption in the wake of the pandemic. As consumers become more discerning, the industry finds itself inviting greater transparency in all processes, Somaiya believes. \"The journey of a product from the ingredient to your home is a long one\u2014there are many links in the chain and it is filled with opacity. The endeavour is to make the [process more transparent](https://www.vogue.in/fashion/content/5-ways-the-fashion-industry-can-achieve-a-greener-future) and encourage consumers to only buy from places where transparency exists,\" he says. Rawla seconds the sentiment, and concludes, \"With growing awareness of environmental concerns, paired with new global standards and consumer demand, sustainability and clean beauty is no longer a philanthropic quest, but a business one.\" Also read: [Why is it still so hard to recycle beauty packaging?](https://www.vogue.in/beauty/content/recycling-beauty-packaging-challenges) [The new rules for building a beauty brand in 2020](https://www.vogue.in/beauty/content/the-new-rules-for-building-a-beauty-brand-in-2020) [Why are more skincare and makeup brands "}
