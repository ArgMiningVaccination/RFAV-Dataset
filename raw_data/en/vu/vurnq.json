Decades of research have failed to identify any specific therapeutic targets outside of antibiotics, infectious source elimination, and supportive care. More recently, vitamin C has emerged as a potential therapeutic agent to treat sepsis. Vitamin C has been shown to be deficient in septic patients and the administration of high dose intravenous as opposed to oral vitamin C leads to markedly improved and elevated serum levels. Its physiologic role in sepsis includes attenuating oxidative stress and inflammation, improving vasopressor synthesis, enhancing immune cell function, improving endovascular function, and epigenetic immunologic modifications. Multiple clinical trials have demonstrated the safety of vitamin C and two recent studies have shown promising data on mortality improvement. Currently, larger randomized controlled studies are underway to validate these findings. With further study, vitamin C may become standard of care for the treatment of sepsis, but given its safety profile, current treatment can be justified with compassionate use.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2020-01-22", "cleaned_text": "The Emerging Role of Vitamin C as a Treatment for Sepsis [https://doi.org/10.3390/nu12020292](https://doi.org/10.3390/nu12020292) [Vitamin [1](#B1-nutrients-12-00292)]. The incidence of sepsis continues to rise in hospitals and intensive care units worldwide: approximately 31 million cases of sepsis occur globally every year, with approximately 6 million deaths [ [2](#B2-nutrients-12-00292)]. In the United States, an estimated 535 cases of sepsis occur annually per 100,000 people, accounting for more than USD 23 billion in annual U.S. hospital expenditures in 2013 [ [2](#B2-nutrients-12-00292), [3](#B3-nutrients-12-00292)]. Despite new advances in critical care support techniques, 30-45% of patients die following hospitalization with severe sepsis and septic shock [ [4](#B4-nutrients-12-00292), [5](#B5-nutrients-12-00292)]. Sepsis can affect every organ system to cause morbidity and mortality. One particularly devastating complication of sepsis is acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), a severe form of sepsis-induced lung injury. Compared with other forms of acute lung injury, patients with sepsis-induced lung injury spend more days on the mechanical ventilator and have a higher mortality rate [ [6](#B6-nutrients-12-00292)]. Sepsis disproportionately affects elderly patients with comorbidities, such as impaired immune function and limited functional status [ [7](#B7-nutrients-12-00292)]. The most common infectious source of sepsis in patients is pneumonia, followed by intra-abdominal and endovascular infections [ [8](#B8-nutrients-12-00292)]. [9](#B9-nutrients-12-00292)]. Oxidants produced during sepsis promote endothelial dysfunction, injuring surface glycocalyx proteins (e.g., syndecan-1) as well as damaging cell membranes and promoting the expression of intercellular adhesion molecules. During sepsis, endothelial cell damage leads to the loss of microvascular barrier function, resulting in enhanced vascular permeability. Furthermore, oxidant-induced expression of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines upregulates endothelial cell surface adhesion molecules, which to activated neutrophil and platelet adhesion in the microvasculature. Despite uncovering the complex multicellular activation pathways that drive tissue injury, a \"cure\" remains elusive. Clinical trials have included over 15,000 patients and spent over one billion US dollars in randomized clinical trial costs [ [10](#B10-nutrients-12-00292)]. These trials have targeted mediators of inflammation or coagulation such as statin agents [ [11](#B11-nutrients-12-00292), [12](#B12-nutrients-12-00292)], activated protein C [ [13](#B13-nutrients-12-00292)], and monoclonal antibody to endotoxin [ [14](#B14-nutrients-12-00292)], but have not safely reduced sepsis mortality, suggesting that single-target therapy fails to meet the challenges of treating the complex pathophysiology of sepsis. Overall, this accumulated knowledge strongly suggests that a more \"pleotropic\" (i.e., broad-based) form of therapy that can interrupt multiple pathways is required to uncover the \"holy grail\" of treating sepsis. At present, in 21st-century critical care practice, antibiotics, \"source control,\" and maintaining hemodynamic stability with fluid administration and vasopressors constitutes the mainstay therapy for sepsis. More recently, there has been emerging evidence for the use of vitamin C as a treatment of sepsis. 2. Pharmacology and Physiology of Vitamin C [Figure 1](#nutrients-12-00292-f001)), is a water-soluble vitamin which is found in all fruits and vegetables, but is particularly concentrated in citrus fruits, green peppers, strawberries, broccoli, green leaves, and potatoes [ [15](#B15-nutrients-12-00292)]. It was first isolated between 1927 and 1930 from ox adrenals by the Nobel laureate Albert Szent-Gy\u00f6rgyi at Cambridge University and the Mayo Clinic. Most animal species synthesize vitamin C in the kidneys or the liver. Humans, some mammals (such as gorillas, monkeys, bats, and guinea pigs), birds, and fish, however, have lost the ability to synthesize vitamin C [ [16](#B16-nutrients-12-00292)]. More specifically, these species lost the ability to synthesize the l-gulono--lactone oxidase (GLO) enzyme, which catalyzes the last step in the vitamin C synthesis: oxidizing l-Gulono-1-lactone into l-Ascorbic acid [ [16](#B16-nutrients-12-00292)]. The human GLO gene was inactivated by random mutations somewhere between 38 and 92 million years ago [ [17](#B17-nutrients-12-00292)]. This gene loss was compatible with survival, however, because of the abundance of vitamin C in the human diet [ [18](#B18-nutrients-12-00292)]. 2.1. Vitamin C Homeostasis [19](#B19-nutrients-12-00292), [20](#B20-nutrients-12-00292)]. Normal plasma vitamin C concentrations range from 50 to 80 uM, but tissue concentrations can often reach millimolar levels (with the exception of saliva) [ [19](#B19-nutrients-12-00292)]. Vitamin C is moved intracellularly by carrier proteins known as sodium-dependent vitamin C transporters Two SVCT 12 transmembrane domains [ [21](#B21-nutrients-12-00292), [22](#B22-nutrients-12-00292)]. While almost all body tissues (including white blood cells and platelets) express SVCT2, SVCT1 is expressed exclusively by intestinal epithelial cells, the proximal convoluted renal tubules, and the liver [ [21](#B21-nutrients-12-00292), [22](#B22-nutrients-12-00292)]. [Figure 2](#nutrients-12-00292-f002)) actively transports vitamin C into the epithelial cells [ [21](#B21-nutrients-12-00292)]. Additionally, in the intestinal lumen, an oxidized form of vitamin C (dehydroascorbic acid (DHA)), is transported by the abundant facilitative glucose transporters GLUT into the intestinal epithelium [ [21](#B21-nutrients-12-00292)]. More specifically, GLUT2 and GLUT8, which are expressed on the apical (luminal) membrane of the intestinal epithelium, are integral to DHA uptake [ [23](#B23-nutrients-12-00292)]. Following absorption, the water-soluble vitamin C molecule distributes in the blood and the extracellular compartment. Tissues then take up the vitamin C via the SVCT2 transporters ( [Figure 2](#nutrients-12-00292-f002)) [ [23](#B23-nutrients-12-00292)]. Red blood cells are an exception, as they take up DHA and reduce it via the glutaredoxin protein or glutathione [ [24](#B24-nutrients-12-00292)]. Finally, the kidneys freely filter vitamin C and reabsorb it via SVCT1 in the proximal convoluted renal tubules [ [23](#B23-nutrients-12-00292)]. [26](#B26-nutrients-12-00292), [27](#B27-nutrients-12-00292), [28](#B28-nutrients-12-00292)]. Moreover, aging humans (who have a higher baseline critical illness mortality) require more dietary vitamin C to reach a desired plasma ascorbate concentration. These observations are confirmed in animal studies that show diminished SVCT1 mRNA expression with aging, resulting in a decline in the capacity of cells to absorb vitamin C [ [28](#B28-nutrients-12-00292), [29](#B29-nutrients-12-00292)]. [30](#B30-nutrients-12-00292)]. The bioavailability, which is the percentage (%) of the drug that reaches the systemic circulation, is 100% for a single oral dose of 200 mg but decreases to 33% with a single dose of 1250 mg [ [30](#B30-nutrients-12-00292)]. This is because the intestinal SVCT1 achieves maximal saturation around 500-1000 mg ( [Figure 3](#nutrients-12-00292-f003)). In addition, the bioavailability does not decrease linearly because of alterations in renal vitamin C excretion [ [30](#B30-nutrients-12-00292)]. Overall, the maximum peak plasma concentration that was achieved with long-term, high-dose oral dosing (i.e., 3 g every 4 h) is 220 uM [ [31](#B31-nutrients-12-00292)]. Intravenous vitamin C administration, however, can bypass the limitations of SVCT1-induced bioavailability to achieve 70-fold higher plasma concentrations compared to oral administration [ [31](#B31-nutrients-12-00292)]. In contrast to oral intake, intravenous administration can achieve a peak plasma concentration up to 15,000 uM [ [31](#B31-nutrients-12-00292)]. It is key to understand that most of the earlier trials did not appreciate the differential pharmacokinetics of vitamin C and made assumptions that the plasma levels achieved with oral administration are equivalent with the intravenous administration. 2.2. Pleiotropic Physiologic Functions of Vitamin C [25](#B25-nutrients-12-00292)]. These include direct antioxidant properties and cofactor properties for a wide array of enzymes in a wide variety of cellular structures and organelles, resulting in varied tissue and organ-system effects ( [Table 1](#nutrients-12-00292-t001)). 2.3. Vitamin C's and ARDS [26](#B26-nutrients-12-00292), [27](#B27-nutrients-12-00292), [32](#B32-nutrients-12-00292), [113](#B113-nutrients-12-00292)]. Furthermore, lower vitamin C levels correlate with higher incidence of organ failure and worse outcomes in septic patients [ [93](#B93-nutrients-12-00292)]. In fact, very low plasma vitamin C levels, averaging around 18 uM, are a predictable feature in severely septic patients [ [114](#B114-nutrients-12-00292)]. This is caused by the explosive cytokine release present in sepsis, which interferes with the cellular regulation of vitamin C absorption. Seno et al. showed that inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF and IL-1, known to be present in sepsis, negatively regulate endothelial SVCT2 activity; this results in the depletion of intracellular vitamin C levels [ [115](#B115-nutrients-12-00292)]. In addition, during this overwhelming disease state of oxidative stress and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, there is increased vitamin C consumption by the somatic cells and by leukocyte turnover [ [40](#B40-nutrients-12-00292)]. As [Figure 2](#nutrients-12-00292-f002)suggests, leukocytes can have an up to 100-fold increase in the concentration of vitamin C compared to plasma. The increased production and turnover of those cells contributes to vitamin C depletion in sepsis and vasopressin production [ [41](#B41-nutrients-12-00292), [117](#B117-nutrients-12-00292), [118](#B118-nutrients-12-00292)]. Furthermore, vitamin C protects against the loss of epithelial and endothelial barriers and enhances neutrophil function in a multidimensional way. Moreover, vitamin C promotes lymphocytic and neutrophilic activity while attenuating neutrophil necrosis and NETosis regulates nuclear cellular responses to stress and hypoxia by regulating in pleotropic ways ( [Table 1](#nutrients-12-00292-t001)). The combination of vitamin C's vital functions and its depletion in septic states justifies the use of high-dose intravenous vitamin C (HDIVC) in the early phases of severe sepsis and septic shock [ [116](#B116-nutrients-12-00292)]. [Figure 4](#nutrients-12-00292-f004). These include enhanced lung epithelial barrier function (i.e., via claudins and occludins) and by epigenetic and transcriptional enhancement of protein-channels which regulate the alveolar clearance, such as aquaporin-5, cystic fibrosis [ [128](#B128-nutrients-12-00292), [129](#B129-nutrients-12-00292)]. evidence that HDIVC treatment in sepsis-induced ARDS results in significantly lower levels of circulating cell-free DNA [ [108](#B108-nutrients-12-00292)], which have been associated with multiorgan failure. HDIVC treatment also resulted in significant reduction of plasma circulating syndecan-1, a component of the endothelial glycocalyx, whose levels closely correlate with and predict mortality in patients with severe sepsis and ARDS [ [107](#B107-nutrients-12-00292)]. 3. Clinical Trials [130](#B130-nutrients-12-00292)]. There was a dramatic reduction in mortality in the vitamin C group\u201437% versus 71% in the standard care group (p < 0.01) [ [130](#B130-nutrients-12-00292)]. A phase I trial in 2014 [ [114](#B114-nutrients-12-00292)] proved that plasma vitamin C levels in patients with severe sepsis were low, almost at scorbutic levels, and that HDIVC administration had a dose-dependent effect in the prevention of multi-organ failure, as measured by the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores [ [131](#B131-nutrients-12-00292)]. Patients who received a total of 200 mg/kg/day of HDIVC for 4 days (administered in 50 mg/kg/dose, every 6 h), had significantly lower SOFA scores than placebo, and even lower scores than the patients who received lower-doses of IV vitamin C (50 mg/kg/day administered at 12.5 mg/kg/dose, every 6 h for 4 days). In this trial, the patients in the HDIVC group (200 mg/kg/day) achieved plasma levels of up to 3000 uM at day 4. The patients receiving HDIVC also demonstrated statistically lower inflammatory biomarker levels (C-Reactive protein and procalcitonin) and lower thrombomodulin levels, which is a marker of endothelial injury [ [114](#B114-nutrients-12-00292)]. [132](#B132-nutrients-12-00292)] compared patients who received hydrocortisone (50 mg IV every 6 h for 7 days or until ICU discharge), thiamine (200 mg IV every 12 h for 4 days or until ICU discharge) and HDIVC (6000 mg/day, in 4 divided doses for 4 days or until ICU discharge) to control. This study showed a 31.9% decrease in absolute hospital mortality between cases who received the triple-therapy and controls (8.5% vs. 40.4% respectively). A small randomized controlled trial, performed around the same time, of 28 patients with septic shock who received moderate doses of IV vitamin C (25 mg/kg every 6 h for 3 days) showed significantly lower mortality in patients who received IV vitamin C\u201414.3% vs. 64.3% [ [117](#B117-nutrients-12-00292)]. The same trial found a significant reduction in average norepinephrine doses, total norepinephrine doses and total duration of norepinephrine infusion [ [117](#B117-nutrients-12-00292)]. A subsequent meta-analysis of the three above studies found a significant benefit of intravenous vitamin C, with \"marked reduction\" in mortality and duration vasopressor administration [ [133](#B133-nutrients-12-00292)]. [134](#B134-nutrients-12-00292)]. This multicenter, randomized, double-blinded trial included 167 patients with sepsis and ARDS who were randomized to receive 50 mg/kg every 6 h of HDIVC for 4 days versus placebo and showed statistically significant difference in 28-day all-cause mortality. The 28-day mortality was 29.8% in the vitamin C group versus 46.3% in the placebo group, although this was a secondary outcome. The statistical effect on mortality remained for up to 60 days following trial completion. The most dramatic reduction in mortality was noted during the period of HDIVC infusion ( [Figure 5](#nutrients-12-00292-f005)). Furthermore, the HDIVC group had a strong trend towards more ventilator-free days (13.1 in the HDIVC group vs 10.6 in the placebo group mean difference, 2.47, 95% CI 0.90-5.85, p = 0.15), ICU-free days to day 28 (10.7 in HDIVC group vs. 7.7, in the placebo group, p = 0.03), and more hospital-free days (22.6 in HDIVC group vs. 15.5, respectively, p = 0.04). This trial did not find significant reductions in the SOFA scores, C-reactive protein, thrombomodulin or procalcitonin. Those biomarkers and scores, however, were not measured among the patients who \"graduated\" early from the ICU (a group that was heavily shifted towards the HDIVC group) or in those patients who died (heavily shifted towards the placebo group), indicating a strong selection bias, which makes these results difficult to interpret. Several other randomized controlled trials of HDIVC are under way, such as the VICTAS trial, and the Clinical Trials Network for the Prevention and Early Treatment of Acute Lung Injury (PETAL Network) is currently planning a randomized controlled trial of HDIVC for the prevention of ARDS. 4. Adverse Effects of Vitamin C Therapy [35](#B35-nutrients-12-00292)]. The second was a study of infused vitamin C continuously at 66 mg/kg per hour for the first 24 h in patients with greater than 50% surface area burns showed that the therapy was well-tolerated with no reported side effects [ [135](#B135-nutrients-12-00292)]. One proposed side effect of HDIVC is an increased propensity for oxalate kidney stone production, but this has not been shown in any clinical trials to date. [136](#B136-nutrients-12-00292), [137](#B137-nutrients-12-00292)]. It does not, however, raise blood glucose readings from a basic metabolic panel or glucose results using blood gas laboratories that employ hexokinase technology for analysis. This finding has recently been questioned by a review of five patients where the artifact was not appreciated [ [138](#B138-nutrients-12-00292)]. For now, care must be taken to assure an accurate blood glucose level from a metabolic laboratory (i.e., basic metabolic panel (BMP)) or arterial blood gas panel (ABG) before initiating any insulin therapy, given the risk of hypoglycemia due to incorrect dosage of insulin from artefactual glucometer readings. 5.
