Heaters: Mats run in a very safe zone of 0.2-0.8 milligauss. (Global TOC criteria is 2 milligauss. Electrical field: Low EMF.) Usage: The product should only be used in the country where it was purchased and shipped. Usage outside those geographical locations voids any warranty and can cause severe damage to the product. HigherDOSE will not be responsible for any damages incurred because of this. Q: What are the technologies in the Infrared PEMF Mat and how do they work? A: PEMF (Pulsed Electromagnetic Field) sends electromagnetic waves through your body to help promote your body's own recovery process. Unlike the harmful electromagnetic waves found in devices like x-ray machines and microwaves, PEMF waves are delivered in small bursts at a low-frequency, mimicking the same kind of electromagnetic waves you'd find in nature. The longer you use it - both over time and during your PEMF session - the more you will feel the long-term benefits. The PEMF (Pulsed Electromagnetic Field) technology used in the Mat is based on optimized frequency, intensity and wave type of synergy with the other therapies which are part of the mat design; Far Infrared Therapy, Negative Ion Therapy, and Crystal Therapy HigherDOSE specializes in all things infrared. Far Infrared Heat , which can also be found in the HigherDOSE Infrared Sauna Blanket, deeply penetrates the body to promote healing, increase circulation, and quiet inflammation. Our infrared devices are low EMF and encourage whole-body relaxation. Q: What's the difference between the original Mat and the Go Mat? A: Both our Mat sizes - original and Go - contain the same powerful recovery technologies. The main difference is size! The original Infrared PEMF Mat is the size of a yoga mat: the perfect place to flow, meditate, recharge, or relax from at home. The Go Mat is more compact and sized for travel - or your WFH chair! Q: Who should use this device? A: The Infrared PEMF Mat is literally for every body. Whether you deal with chronic pain, workout frequently (and intensely), or just need a moment to relax, lying on the Mat for even a couple of minutes a day (or whenever you need it) will help ease your mind and body from the inside out. If you are a wellness practitioner, our mats are a great addition to help assist patients' recoveries and healing journeys as a part of your overall practice. Perfect for people suffering from: Minor muscle pain Minor joint pain Muscle spasms Minor sprains // strains Exercise-induced muscle tightness Stress Poor sleep Still have questions? [Contact our team](/pages/contact-us)! Investing in this mat for myself was just what I needed. I am a massage therapist who's been helping others feel their best for 20 years now. It's time to do the same for myself. So glad I purchased this! Helps me with aches & pains & helps me sleep like a baby & I dream every time I use it so I know it puts me in the brainwave place it says it will! Someday I'll buy myself a go mat but right now I'm investing in Tibetan and Crystal bowls as I opened a Sound Studio this past summer. I got this for the healing properties for myself and my chronic EpsteinBarr, but my boyfriend started using it, and he has found amazing results for his Ankylosing Spondylitis with much less pain and stiffness than he has had in many years. He is off of that strong prescription medicine that wiped out his energy, and is able to work most days now.
