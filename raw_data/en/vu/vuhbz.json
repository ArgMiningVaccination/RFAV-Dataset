And how can you heal your spiritual energy? Today, you'll learn all of this plus much more in our handy guide... Table of Contents What Is Spiritual Energy? Spiritual energy is also known as prana. Prana is known by different names across different cultures. In Japan they say \"ki\", in China it's \"ch'i\". It's a concept that is similar to the idea of \"pneuma\" in Greek, or the Hawaiian idea of \"mana.\" In Western culture it's known as the \"universal life force.\" These are all just different ways of saying the same thing. Spiritual energy is constant and it's everywhere. It fuels all of creation. Spiritual energy or \"prana\" is directed by love. Love is what drives the energy of the world. Spiritual energy and love are deeply and closely connected. Types of Spiritual Energy There are many types of spiritual energy, but there are four main ones. [These four are the most commonly understood](https://paranormal.lovetoknow.com/about-paranormal/what-is-spiritual-energy) and they all talk about life force energy with different words. Divine Love This is a term used by many different faiths - Christianity and Judaism being the biggest ones. These and other religions would say that [spiritual energy](https://yourspiritualrevolution.org/) is what comes from the divine love of God. This is a love that is pure. It can't be corrupted by anyone or anything. It's a love that is constantly around us and is everlasting. While this is the core belief of divine love, each religion has a different method of connecting to the divine love in a spiritual way. Mother Earth Spirituality This is the Native American understanding of spiritual energy. Many Native American nations populated America at one point, each with their own unique system of beliefs. The concept of Mother Earth spirituality was the one common ground between all nations. To them, the sky was the Father and the Earth was the Mother. Regardless of their specific beliefs, all nations came together in the total and complete respect for everything on and of the earth. Prana Prana is a Hindu word that means \"breath\" in their language of Sanskrit. While this is the exact meaning, it's more commonly understood as a life-sustaining force. Many Hindu writings say that Prana is an energy that thrives within all things. This includes intangible, abstract things like human thoughts. It's believed that this life force can survive the death of a human and come back through reincarnation. Chi Chi is Chinese and can also be spelled \"Qi\" but the two are pronounced the same. This is the life force of the world and they believe it contains both female and male energies - or yin and yang. When working with the two energies, the goal is to achieve the perfect balance between the two as they are opposites. You do this by opening your chakras to allow the chi energy to flow throughout your body and into your energy vortexes. Transformations Through Spiritual Energy Because spiritual energy is so all-encompassing and is present all the time, it's the ability to transform a person is incredible. You can receive spiritual energy in many different ways. This can include enlightenment or healing of your mind, body, and soul.

Yoga can improve your physical strength and balance while calming and balancing your mind at the same time. There are many different types of yoga, one being Kundalini yoga. [The Kundalini energy is located at the base of the spine](https://paranormal.lovetoknow.com/about-paranormal/what-is-spiritual-energy), also known as the root chakra. It needs to travel through all seven chakras of the body and the three knots before you can obtain enlightenment or nirvana. This is a type of yoga that is deeply connected to the concept of Prana. Some believe them to be the same thing. Others would say that activating prana is required before Kundalini can be achieved. Kundalini is a type of yoga that brings all other types and practices together to get the full spectrum of benefits. Most types of yoga use a combination of postures and breathing. Kundalini yoga takes it a step further and brings both meditation and chanting into the practice. It's the combination of all these elements at once that can lead to an extremely intense experience with noticeable effects.

When it comes to spiritual energy and experiencing its effects, there are [several different types of meditation techniques](https://paranormal.lovetoknow.com/about-paranormal/what-is-spiritual-energy) that can help you get there. Sitting Meditation Also known as Zazen, or \"zen meditation.\" This is the art of sitting in silence. There is no thinking, only breathing exercises that connect the mind and body. In this way, you can find enlightenment. Mindful Meditation Also known as Vipassana and is practiced by Buddhists. This type of meditation will eventually set the mind free and allow you to better observe thoughts rather than judge them. The mind will become quiet and when done properly, thoughts will cease entirely. Walking Meditation This technique is found in multiple religions and it is the art of walking and [meditating at the same time](https://relaxlikeaboss.com/best-time-to-meditate/). You can do this in nature or a labyrinth. There are also special paths designed for meditation that can be perfect for this. With walking meditation, you use the walking itself as your [point of focus](https://www.wildmind.org/walking/overview), rather than breathing, as is the case with many other types. Another difference is your attention. It is not drawn away from the outside world. You must remain aware of your surroundings. For some, this type of focus is easier to achieve than shutting out the world through regular sitting meditation. Praying Praying is another form of meditation that works differently from typical techniques. Most religions use prayer in some form or another, be it chanting, spontaneous prayer, or doctrine. Some describe prayer as a direct interaction with God which can bring results and resources. Others argue that it's more of a direct connection to spiritual energy which can bring enlightenment. Tai Chi Tai Chi is a form of moving meditation that is also a martial art. This practice is one that works to balance the yin and yang chi energies. There are many forms of martial arts, but Tai Chi may be the only one that is more of a meditation tool first. Vision Quest A vision quest is something that many Native American and Inuit people partake in as part of their beliefs. They believe it's a rite of passage or an initiation of sorts, that helps you establish a connection with the spiritual world. The quest itself requires intense focus. When on the quest you will be [ fasting](https://mybestessentials.com/benefits-of-fasting-for-a-day/) and not sleeping. The quest and its goal are the only things you think about. Transcendental Meditation This is a practice that originated with Hindu traditions. It promotes a state of deep relaxation. It does this through the use of a mantra and is based on the Hindu Vedanta. The [Hindu Vedanta ](https://vedanta.org/what-is-vedanta/)is an ancient philosophy based on the sacred scriptures of India. While it originated in India as part of Hindu, the philosophies are relevant to all countries, cultures, and religions.
