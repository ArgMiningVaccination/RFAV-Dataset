Late fees may apply. 100% NATURAL CANDLES Julie Shaw Not all candles are created equal! At N.A. & ETHIC we don't use any synthetic fragrances or petrol based waxes. Each natural candle is constructed from a signature blend of pure rapeseed and coconut wax, pure essential oils and an unbleached cotton wick. We don't use any other ingredients. We created N.A.& ETHIC to bring the power of nature into peoples homes I always loved the ritual of lighting a candle at home and instantly making it cosier. The flicker of candlelight produces an ambience that can't be replicated. Unfortunately, I found it hard to find a candle that didn't give me a headache while burning it. It was only after diving deeper into my 'Candle Related Research' that I learned why! Scents like 'pumpkin spice' are produced using synthetic petrochemicals derived from crude oil that carry carcinogens and have reproductive toxicity warnings. Our number 1 priority is your happiness and so trying our products should be a risk-free experience. That's why we offer a 100% money back guarantee within 30 days of receiving your candles - no questions asked. If you don't absolutely love our candles you can send them back to us for free and get a full refund! After spending thousands of hours developing our range of natural candles, and testing all others on the market, we stand by our products 100%. Every candle is handmade in the UK, by us, from scratch. We melt the wax in our London studio and hand blend it with essential oils. They are poured by hand one by one, each given as much attention to detail as the next. We also hand pack all candles into custom boxes, and dispatch them ourselves across the UK. Not a synthetic ingredient in sight, our candles are 100% synthetic free. From the wax, to the wick and the oils. Everything has come from nature. Our glass vessels are not only sustainable and durable, but completely elegant to fit seamlessly into your home. Our candle packaging as well as courier packaging are all either recyclable or biodegradable. The majority of so called 'natural candles' use a plant based natural wax and wick but they also use synthetic fragrance oils. We utilize the benefits of aromatherapy by only using precious essential oils for fragrance. "}
