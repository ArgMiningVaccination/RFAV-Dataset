From major cities to small suburbs, the use and abuse of opioids has spread like wildfire, consuming entire families and whole communities without prejudice. While the influencing factors associated with this tremendous upsurge in opioid dependence around the nation has varied, the death toll and utter destruction associated with the spreading addiction continues to rise. If you want to get clean, you must acknowledge that you can get and stay sober. Understanding your options in relation to treatment centers, and their various clinical approaches, is imperative to choosing a rehab facility best suited to meet your individual needs. Identifying the severity of your addiction and the personal goals you hope to achieve throughout the recovery journey can aid in selecting a treatment facility capable of managing your detox symptoms. In addition, choosing the most appropriate rehab program can best facilitate your transitioning into a clinically comprehensive therapeutic environment once the primary symptoms of your opioid detoxification are achieved. Will a [holistic approach to detox](https://ranchcreekrecovery.com/what-we-offer/holistic-and-experiential-therapies/) from your opioid addiction suit your personal needs? Easing Opioid Withdrawal: Can It Be Done? While the consequences of [long-term opioid addiction](https://ranchcreekrecovery.com/what-we-treat/opioid-addiction/) can be physically devastating, easing the withdrawal symptoms associated with opioid detox can be accomplished. A majority of opioid addictions require medical assistance in order to safely withdrawal the body from the grips of opioid addiction. This is due to the fact that when you first started abusing opioids, your body and brain built up a tolerance to the substance, forcing you to take larger and larger amounts to achieve the high you were looking for. Soon after starting your opioid use, your entire being became dependent on the substance in order to simply feel normal. Now, while you are attempting to withdrawal from your opioid addiction, your body is striving toward a natural homeostasis, but the damage done to your neurological and physical functioning is causing you to experience a tremendous amount of pain and discomfort. Easing these symptoms can be accomplished in a number of manners, from pharmaceutical interventions to some extremely effective holistic measures aimed at decreasing your discomfort and expediting your transition toward physical normalcy. Opioid Withdrawal Treatment The available options for opioid withdrawal treatment can vary from facility to facility, but focusing on a holistic approach is inherently specialized and individually tailored. This is due to the onus placed upon the personalized experience of opioid detoxification and the importance of approaching each person as a unique being. While the withdrawal process can be physically and mentally draining on the participant, the primary benefit of a holistic approach is the comprehensive method to therapy: implementing techniques that focus on every aspect of the recovering addict, including the mind, body, and soul. A few key holistic treatment potions for opioid withdrawal and therapeutic recovery include: - Mindfulness Training Mindfulness involves taking a moment to relax, to become aware of your present situation - the sounds, smells, and surrounding environment - and to think calmly about your emotions and feelings. By considering thoughts in this context, you're better able to achieve wellness, as mindfulness requires that you approach yourself without judgment and without thinking about what's right and what's wrong. It helps you find happiness within your present being through quiet reflection and meditations, during which you are taught to focus on, appreciate, and take in the smells, textures, and colors of your environment. - Equine Therapy This clinical intervention incorporates the technique of animal care and maintenance, enabling participants to engage in activities such as grooming, haltering and leading horses under the supervision of a mental health professional. The goal of this clinical treatment is to aid the participant in developing personal skill-sets, such as improved methods of self-control, expanded personal accountability, and increased self-confidence. The aim is to aid all participants in addressing behavioral and emotional challenges associated with their addiction recovery and personal improvement. - Amino Acid Therapy This clinical intervention focuses on the nutritional deficiencies associated with opioid addiction and withdrawal. This includes hormonal imbalances, chronic inflammation, pain, anxiety, and depression. Amino acids are the building blocks for neurotransmitters like Dopamine, GABA, Serotonin and Endorphins, which are closely tied to addictive behavior. With the use of various amino acids, brain chemistry can be adjusted to help normalize and restore deficiencies in these neurotransmitters that spur cravings that can lead to both addiction and relapse. Drugs Used to Help Withdrawal from Opioids While the holistic interventions available throughout the detoxification process are extremely effective, the fact remains that some individuals will require additional pharmaceutical interventions during their detox process. Specific drugs used to help an individual withdrawal from opioids include: - Methadone - Buprenorphine - Lucemyra All of these prescription interventions vary in their effectiveness and application. Deciding to use drug interventions such as these during the detox phase is for a medical professional to decide, so receiving a thorough and comprehensive medical assessment prior to beginning rehab is imperative to starting the process appropriately. The point to starting therapy is to achieve sustained health and sobriety; Make sure to follow the advice of medical and clinical professionals before deciding on any specific clinical approach and intervention.
