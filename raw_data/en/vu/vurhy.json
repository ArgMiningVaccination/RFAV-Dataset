The scope of the update was limited to program revisions that are editorial or technical in nature and, as such, typically would not be published for public review. However, owing to the re-insertion of reforestation as a project type under the protocol, the Reserve is providing an opportunity for public comment as a courtesy even though the reforestation provisions were previously available for public review when version 4.0 of the FP was developed. Components related to eligibility or other significant policies within the FP are otherwise not being considered as a part of this update. The draft protocol underwent a 30-day public comment period that ended on Friday, March 3, 2023.

A workgroup draft of the protocol, which incorporated public and workgroup comments since April, was released in August 2009, followed by a public workshop to discuss the draft protocol. A final version of the protocol was presented to the Reserve Board for adoption in September 2009. Version 3.0 Public Workshop The Reserve hosted a public workshop in Sacramento on August 17, 2009 to discuss revisions to the draft protocol and to solicit further public feedback.

See the agenda and presentation slides below. Version 3.0 Protocol Development in 2008 Since the adoption of the U.S. Forest Protocol Version 2.1 in September 2007, the Reserve worked closely with stakeholders, forest experts, environmental organizations and government agencies to update, improve and expand the protocol (see summary of changes section below). The first draft revision of the protocol was released for public comment in December 2008. Version 3.0 Public Comments Public comments were submitted on the draft U.S. Forest Protocol Version 3.0 in December 2008 and January 2009. See the draft protocol, staff responses to public comments, and public comments below.

The PIA set forth: (i) the project developer's obligation to comply with the U.S. Forest Protocol, and (ii) the rights and remedies of the Reserve in the event of any failure of the project developer to comply with its obligations, including compensation for any \"reversal\" of greenhouse gas reductions.

The bill mandated the establishment of protocols to encourage carbon sink activities by creating an incentive for forest landowners to undertake forest conservation, conservation-based management, and reforestation projects.
