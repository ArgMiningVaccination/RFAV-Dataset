Programs now enrolling for Fall 2023. [Apply Now](https://muih.edu/admissions/apply-now/) The Post-Master's Certificate (PMC) in Nutrition and Integrative Health provides evidence-based nutrition education for health professionals and those with advanced science training.It integrates a biochemical perspective of nutrition into a broader context of whole-food healing and whole-person health and wellness care. MUIH offers the only PMC in Nutrition and Integrative Health in the U.S., and it is one of the few nutrition programs to offer whole foods cooking labs that apply nutrition theory. This program sets graduates apart from their peers by building skills and knowledge to support patients and clients in the rapidly growing field of integrative nutrition. This 15-credit program can be completed fully online in 3 trimesters (one year). This program is designed for healthcare and wellness professionals who are not licensed nutritionists/dietitians but can legally provide nutrition care. [This includes](https://theana.org/NutritionRegulationsbyProfession) providers living in a state where: their healthcare license includes nutrition; their healthcare license is exempt from nutrition law; their profession is exempt from nutrition licensure requirements; nutrition care is not criminalized for those without a license; or there is no licensure law for nutrition. A variety of healthcare and wellness professionals may find this program useful and relevant to their work including physicians, physician assistants, registered nurses, advance practice registered nurses, acupuncturists, herbalists, health and wellness coaches, athletic trainers and fitness coaches, massage therapists, mental health professionals, physical therapists, occupational therapists, dentists, pharmacists, osteopaths, and chiropractors. The certificate provides healthcare and wellness professionals with skills and knowledge in nutrition to address patient and client health concerns and educate patients and clients on the role of whole foods and nutrition supplementation in the maintenance of health and wellness. Before enrolling in the program, applicants should check state laws to understand the parameters for nutrition practice within their state. A secondary audience for the program is healthcare and wellness professionals who wish to apply to the Doctor of Clinical Nutrition program, but lack the prerequisite graduate-level nutrition credits. Note: While anyone who meets the formal admission requirements is eligible to enroll in the Post-Master's Certificate, those who do not currently work with patients/clients, and those who wish to become certified or licensed nutritionists, are encouraged instead to enroll in MUIH's [Master of Science in Nutrition and Integrative Health](https://muih.edu/academics/nutrition/master-of-science-in-nutrition-integrative-health/) program. The Post-Master's Certificate alone does not provide foundational skills in patient/client-practitioner interactions or meet eligibility requirements for nutrition certification (see Licensure, Certification, & Credentialing section below for more details). This program explores contemporary nutrition science and traditional dietary practices and critically evaluates current paradigms of nutrition, food, and health. Students integrate a biochemical perspective of nutrition into a broader context of whole-food healing and whole-person health and wellness care. The program provides students the opportunity to study in a cohort of like-minded healthcare and wellness professionals in a scholarly community centered entirely on wellness. Together, students focus on practical patient/client applications such as creating nutrition care plans using whole foods and nutritional supplementation; helping patients/clients distinguish between food fads, trends, and sound nutrition information; and learning to apply and teach whole foods cooking. Of the 15 credits required for this program, students take 12 core credits and 3 elective credits. Elective courses provide the opportunity to focus on applied areas of interest, including life cycle nutrition, dietary supplements, mindful eating, whole food preparation, or laboratory assessment. |Trimester of Entry:||Fall| |Application Priority Deadline:|| | Complete Essay Questions in application: This program consists of 12 credits of required courses and 3 credits of elective courses.

The role of food in preventing and treating a variety of illnesses is now well known and recognized, and more health care professionals will be needed to provide care for patients with various medical conditions and to advise people who want to improve their overall health. Health care professionals with advanced nutrition skills and knowledge will support the continued projected growth of healthcare occupations in the U.S. Graduates of MUIH's nutrition programs are employed in a variety of settings including private practice; integrative group practices; nutrition clinics; health care systems; hospitals; community, non-profit, and outreach organizations; state and local health departments; school systems; culinary organizations; athletic and recreational organizations; and colleges and universities. Many graduates chose to have a portfolio career in which they have multiple positions and employers within one or more profession, rather than one full-time job. A portfolio career provides such individuals with variety in their work life and the opportunity to develop a wide and varied professional network. The U.S. Bureau of Labor and Statistics projects healthcare occupations to grow 13% from 2021 to 2031, much faster than the average for all occupations. The growth rate for nutritionists and dieticians is projected to be 7% during this same time period.
