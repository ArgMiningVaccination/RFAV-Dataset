However, standard vaccination does not induce a robust antibody response in these patients. Researchers from Yale Cancer Center presented results at the American Society of Hemotology (5-8 December 2015) [[1]](#fn_1) showing that the high-dose flu vaccine Fluzone, delivered with a booster injection 30 days later, can significantly reduce the rate of flu in PCD patients. Out of 51 patients, only three (5.9%) developed flu during the 2014-2015 flu season (median age 65 years), compared with 20% of patients given one standard flu vaccine (based on historical data). Seroprotection was also at the highest level reported in PCD patients, say the researchers. They are now planning a randomised trial to compare the strategy with traditional flu vaccination during the flu season in 2016.
