We loved it and it was gone before a year had passed. In July '18, we bought a 60 lb pale of the raw wildflower honey and picked it up in the store. Crystal's was very accommodating and allowed us to pick up they honey after normal store hours since we were only in the area for 3 days, and we had to work around our kids' nap schedules. This honey was even better than our first 20 lbs! It is really creamy with an almost butter like consistency, and tastes wonderful. So good that I sometimes sneak spoonfuls of plain honey. We highly recommend them and their honey! Kelly V. Traditional, unfiltered, wildflower RAW honey. I have been using this heaven fluid for decades, it keeps energized and healthy, diabetic friendly.
