Contemplative practices are activities that guide you to direct your attention to a specific focus\u2014often an inward-looking reflection or concentration on a specific sensation or concept. Many spiritual traditions have a long history of using contemplative practices to increase compassion, empathy, and attention, as well as quiet the mind. - Meditation can induce feelings of calm and clear-headedness as well as improve concentration and attention. Brain researcher Richard Davidson's research shows that [meditation](/explore-healing-practices/mindfulness)increases the brain's gray matter density, which can reduce sensitivity to pain, enhance your immune system, help you regulate [difficult emotions](/enhance-your-wellbeing/health/thoughts-emotions/deal-negativity-healthy-way), and relieve [stress](/node/528). Mindfulness meditation in particular has been proven helpful for people with [depression and anxiety](/conditions/anxiety-depression), [cancer](/conditions/cancer), fibromyalgia, chronic pain, [rheumatoid arthritis](/conditions/arthritis), type 2 [diabetes](/conditions/diabetes), chronic fatigue syndrome, and [cardiovascular disease](/conditions/heart-disease). - Prayer may elicit the relaxation response, along with feelings of hope, gratitude, and compassion\u2014all of which have a positive effect on overall wellbeing. There are several types of [prayer](https://www.takingcharge.csh.umn.edu/prayer), many of which are rooted in the belief that there is a higher power that has some level of influence over your life. This belief can provide a sense of comfort and support in difficult times\u2014a recent study found that clinically depressed adults who believed their prayers were heard by a concerned presence responded much better to treatment than those who did not believe. - Yoga is a centuries-old spiritual practice that aims to create a sense of union within the practitioner through physical postures, ethical behaviors, and breath expansion. The systematic practice of [yoga](/explore-healing-practices/yoga)has been found to reduce inflammation and stress, decrease depression and anxiety, lower blood pressure, and increase feelings of wellbeing. - Journaling is another, often overlooked, contemplative practice that can help you become more aware of your inner life and feel more connected to your experience and the world around you. Studies show that writing during difficult times may help you find meaning in life's challenges and become more resilient in the face of obstacles. "}
