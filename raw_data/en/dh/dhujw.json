Essential tremor of the voice (ETv) is another neurogenic voice disorder typically perceived as a shaky voice quality but sometimes associated with a similar voice quality to LD, making it challenging for clinicians to distinguish these voice disorders. A correct diagnosis is essential for accurate and effective treatment of these voice disorders. However, clinical voice experts often confuse these disorders and frequently disagree with each other when judging voice quality or observing speech structures. Development of clinical tools that help clinicians make the correct diagnosis of these disorders is a priority. Therefore, we propose studying a characteristic of dystonias, sensory tricks. A sensory trick is a phenomenon diagnostic of dystonias described as a short-term improvement of symptoms due to sensory cues like touching or supporting a body part or being distracted by a sound. This phenomenon is well studied in other kinds of dystonia but has not been systematically evaluated in LD. This pilot study aims to evaluate whether sensory tricks improve voice symptoms in those with LD compared to those with ETv. If successful, outcomes will help identify specific sensory trick(s) that most clearly change LD symptoms and show promise for improving correct diagnosis of those with LD. The sensory tricks studied should be accessible and affordable for use during assessment by clinicians to help distinguish those with LD from ETv. Importantly, findings will inform future studies to improve utilization by clinicians. - All genders - Over 18 years old - Healthy Volunteers - In Person - Paid Evaluation of the HAPPIEST program - a collaborative team summer research program (IRB#: IRB_00144170) The overall goal of this project is to evaluate the training program at University of Utah of undergraduate students from underrepresented racial/ethnic backgrounds in air pollution-related health research through a faculty-mentored summer program called Health, Air Pollution and Population Initiative in Education and Science Training (HAPPIEST).

Constipation happens when your child has fewer than 3 bowel movements a week. Functional constipation is a condition in which your child withholds stool, usually because they are afraid of the pain associated with passing of hard stools or due to social reasons. It is not due to a medical problem. When your child holds stool much longer than normal, this can cause the stool to become harder and packed (impacted) in the rectum. As a result, your child may have difficulties in passing stool. The study drug was approved in the United States in 2018 to treat adults with constipation.
