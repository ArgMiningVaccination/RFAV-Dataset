HTTP ://COBURN .SENATE .GOV/FFM/ 2 As part of my commitment to question ho w Washington spends your money, I plan to release a series of oversight reports on fede ral agencies. My hope is that this effort will assist federal agencies and those of us in Congress overseeing their budgets, to rein in wasteful spending, to demand measurable results from programs and grantees, and to reevaluate current spendi ng before asking Congress and taxpayers to send more. I hope that agencies and other congressi onal committees alike will welcome this oversight and work with us to help identify even more areas of waste, fraud, and abuse and new ways to better prioritize our nation's limited financial resources. As this report notes, \"CDC Off Center\" was not produced because of any personal animosity against the CDC, nor the good pe ople it employs. As a practicing physician, I have consulted CDC's experts and materials to help me successfully treat my patients, and I value the good work it is capable of doing. Unfortunately in many areas, CDC is just one among many federal agencies that I believe is not properly living up to its own mission. For some reason, the federal government has a difficult time prioritizing spending and demanding measurable results from th ose entrusted with billions of hard- earned tax dollars to help carry out its crucial missions. I believe that you, the American taxpayer, deserve better. As President Lincoln said, we are a \"government of the people, by the people, for the people\" and to uphold that principle we need your help. As part of my ongoing effort to shine the light on the federal government, I encourage anyone with examples of government waste, fraud, or abuse to let us know about it.

Yet while CDC has been given millions, and in some cases billions, of dollars to help prevent certain diseases among Americans, for many of these diseas es the rates have not d ecreased, but have stayed the same or even increased under CDC's watch. In the case of HIV, despit e spending billions of dollars, CDC cannot even repor t how many Americans have the communicable disease. 2 This is not to say that CDC is not trying to tack le these diseases, or that the people who work at the agency are intentionally mi susing taxpayers' hard-earned m oney. A review of recent CDC expenditures, however, demonstrates that a repr ioritization of CDC fundi ng and a review of the approach to certain types of di sease prevention are long overdue. In fiscal year 2007, the CDC has a budget of $10 b illion and a stated mission \"To promote health and quality of life by preventing and contro lling disease, injury, and disability.\" The CDC's website says the agency, \"pledges to the American people: To be a diligent steward of the funds entrusted to it. ...To place the benefits to society above the benefits to the institution\" and it lists as one of its core values \"accountability .\" The mission statement continues: \"As diligent stewards of public trust and public funds, we act decisively and co mpassionately in service to the people's health. We ensure that our research and our services are based on sound science and meet real public needs to achiev e our public health goals.\" 3 This report seeks to hold CDC accountable to the ta xpayers and to highlight spending decisions that, in some instances, appear to demonstrate questionable stewardship of public funds. 1 \"CDC, FAA, NIH, FDA, FBI and USDA Get the Highest Ratings of Thirteen Federal Government Agencies,\" Harris Interactive (R) online survey of 2,337 adults between January 11 and 18, 2007, http://www.prnewswire. com/news/index_mail.shtml?ACCT=104&STORY=/www/story/02-06- 2007/0004521666&EDATE= . 2 \"Disease Burdens in the United States,\" Congressional Research Service (CRS) Memorandum to Senator Tom Coburn (R-OK) from CRS Specialist in Public Health and Epidemiology Domestic Social Policy Division, dated March 12, 2007. 3CDC website, http://www.cdc.gov/about/mission.htm , http://www.cdc.gov/fmo/PDFs/half FY06AppropFactsheet.pdf , accessed October 2006. 5 I. BACKGROUND CDC's History1 The Centers for Disease Control and Preventi on (CDC) was founded in 1946 to help control malaria, and today it makes up one of the 13 ma jor operating components of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). CDC says it has \"remained at the forefront of public health efforts to prevent and control infectious and chronic diseases, injuries, work place hazards, disabilities, and environmental health threats.\" It is respons ible for applying \"research and fi ndings to improve people's daily lives\" and responding to health emergencies. Working with states and other pa rtners, CDC provides a system of health surveillance to monitor and prevent disease outbreaks (and other public safety threat s, including bioterrorism), implement disease prevention strategies, and main tain national health statistics. CDC also guards against international disease transmissi on, with personnel stationed in more than 25 foreign countries. The agency espouses the following ag ency-wide \"health impact goals\": Healthy People in Every Stage of Life All people, and especially those at great er risk of health disparities, will achieve their optimal lifespan with the be st possible quality of health in every stage of life. Healthy People in Healthy Places The places where people live, work, lear n, and play will protect and promote their health and safety, especially those at greater risk of health disparities. People Prepared for Emerging Health Threats People in all communities will be protected from infectious, occupational, environmental, and terrorist threats. Healthy People in a Healthy World People around the world will live safe r, healthier and longer lives through health promotion, health secu rity, and health diplomacy. 1 All information from CDC website, http://www.cdc.gov/about/default.htm , accessed February 2007. 6 CDC Funding1 CDC FUNDING STEADILY INCREASING : CDC's funding has almost tripled over the past decade, with large increases coming after the 2001 anthrax attacks and the 2005 avian flu scare. Yet, depending on which CDC document taxpayers refer to, the agency's funding is either increasing or decreasing. NOT \"COUNTING \" BILLIONS OF DOLLARS : For example, in one year's budget documents, CDC states in a small footnote to a chart, \"Funding does not include transfers to CDC from the Department of State Office of the Global AIDS Coordinator [OGAC] ($439.0 million in FY2005) , as part of the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief.\"2 Following publication of the budget with this footnote, an additional $600,000 was transferred from OGAC to CDC, bringing the tota l transfer to CDC to $439.6 million in FY2005.3 In other words, CDC did not \"count\" al most a half a billion dollars in its budget for HIV/AIDS, even though that money was transferred to and spent by CDC on HIV/AIDS. In subsequent budget documents, CDC again stat es in a small footnote to HIV/AIDS spending, \"Funding does not include transfers to CDC from the Department of State Office of the Global AIDS Coordinator ($604 million in FY 2006), as part of the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief.\" 4 Evidently, the number cited by CDC in its own budget documents, is not accurate. In fact, $604 million was not even a \"real\" number but only an estimate (though taxpayers would not know that from reading th e document) and the actual amount transferred from OGAC to CDC in FY2006 was $578.2 million. 5 In FY07, CDC so far has received $815 million from OGAC, a figure which CDC reports is \"likely to increase\" before the e nd of the fiscal year, as OGAC is \"likely to transfer additional money later this year.\" 6 Perhaps there is a budgetary reason why CDC does not \"count\" over a $1.8 billion dollars it has received and spent over the last few years on HIV/AIDS, but doing so makes it complicated for researchers to compare actual CDC expenditures from year to year. F OLLOWING THE MONEY : If researchers try to calculate CDC's budget by only counting what Congress appropriates directly to the CDC, they may leave out billions of dollars in spending such as the HIV/AIDS funding noted above. Taxpayers should follow the line in CDC budget tables that refers to the total program levels, rather than the line for total Labor, HHS , and Education Appropr iations funding, which sometimes does not include supplemental appropria tions (such as avian fl u funding) and does not count billions in transferred funds from other agencies to CDC. 7 7Figure 1. CDC's Budget http://www.c dc.gov/fmo/PDFs/FY06budgetreqsummary.pdf , page 29; CRS Health and Human Services, and Education: FY2006 Appropriations,\" updated February 22, 2006, http://www.congress.gov/ erp/ra/pdf/RL32952.pdf ; CRS report \"Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education: FY2007 Appropriations,\" updated March 21, 20 07, FY2006 the CDC's funding included $4.3 in the Labor/HHS/Education Appropriations bill and $76 million in the Interior Appropriations bill (for the Agency for Toxic S ubstances and Disease Registry (ATSDR)), as well as $1.6 billion in terrorism funds, $1.5 billion in vaccin es for children, and $2.2 million in user fees. 2 \"FY 2006 CDC/ATSDR Functional Table Financial Management Office,\" January 26, 2006, http://www.cdc.gov/fmo/PDFs/F Y06FundFunctAreaTable.pdf . 3 E-mail correspondence between CDC Program Analyst and the office of Senator Tom Coburn, May 2, 2007. 4 HHS Fiscal Year 2008 Justification of Estimates for Appropriation Committees, http://www.cdc.gov/fmo/PDFs /FY08_CDC_CJ_Final.pdf . 5 Footnote 3, op. cit. 6 Ibid. 7 See page 34 of CDC's FY06 Budget Summary, h ttp://www.cdc.gov/fmo/PDFs/ FY06budgetreqsummary.pdf ; page 31 of CDC's FY08 Justification of Estimates for Appropriation Committees, http://www.cdc.gov/fmo/PDFs /FY08_CDC_CJ_Final.pdf . 8 The FY95 through FY05 funding figures come from the \"CDC Funding History\" graph on page 36 of CDC's FY06 Budget Summary (http://www.cdc.gov/fmo/PDFs/FY06budgetreqsummary.pdf ). Based on the FY04-FY06 figures (see page 34 of same document), it appears the CDC Funding History chart reflects the historical total program funding levels, which would in cludes terrorism funding an d give a more accurate calculation for taxpayer funds CDC actually received. The increas e in FY02 funding reflects one-time terrorism preparedness funding not reflected in FY03, according to CDC. The additional $439.6 million shown in red for FY05 is the amount transferred to CDC from the OGAC, ac cording to a footnote in the FY06 Budget Summary and an updated and unpublished figure from CDC. The FY06 funding figure is from the table on page 31 in the FY08 Justification of Estimates for Appropriation Committees that reports th e total CDC/ATSDR funding level for FY06 was $8.6 billion, and that this funding level does not count $604 million in money spent on HIV/AIDS that was transferred from OGAC (http://www.cd c.gov/fmo/PDFs/FY08_CDC_CJ_Final.pdf ). According to updated and unpublished information from CDC, the report of OGAC transferring $604 million to CDC was an estimate (though the justification document fails to mention this fact) and the actual amount transferred to CDC was $578.2 million (shown in the figure above in red). Th e FY07 figure of $9.19 billion is from \"FY2007 Joint Resolution [CDC] Detail , . The OGAC FY07 transfer of $815 million (shown in the figure above in red) is based on an unpublished CDC figure which is \"likely to increase\" before the end of the fiscal year, as OGAC is \"likely to transfer additional money later this year.\" CDC budget totals Funds transferred to CDC from the Office of the Global AIDS Coordinator (OGAC) 8II. FINDINGS CDC FACILITIES : LAVISH SPENDING OR PRIORITY NEEDS ? CDC's $106 million Thomas R. Harkin Global Communications (& Visitor) Center: a Metaphor for Agency's Prioritization1 Since 1996 the CDC had a visitor center which drew 15,000 visitors a year. The agency itself is located in Atlanta, Georgia, home to one of th e largest 24-hour cable news networks. Yet when faced with static HIV transmission rates, e-coli outbreaks, and the thr eat of bioterrorism, CDC spent $106 million of taxpayers' dollars to build a lavish new visitor center, which includes a 70- foot-wide by 25-foot-tall video wall of rear-projection and plasma television screens inside its new communications center, which houses a $20 million new studio for communicating CDC \"information.\" The CDC spent $106 million to fund the new 202,000 square foot Thomas R. Harkin Global Communications Center in Atlanta, Georgia, which includes a conf erence center, an information center, and a media services facility. 2 In 2005, the U.S. Senate voted to name the building after Senator Tom Harkin, a Democrat from Iowa, who at the time was the ranking member on the appropriations committee which funds the CDC.3 The Center has been built amid a sloping \"greenscape\" with a stream running over and around artificial rocks where rainwater is collected and sent down the stream to a pond and then pump ed back up to the top of the slope and sent 9down again.4 It has limestone bridges, waterfalls a nd Japanese gardens an d fountains, according to the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) .5 The WSJ reports a CDC spokesman said that the Vis itor Center portion of the building will be \"a world class destination,\" with red ants, rats, monkeys, art wo rk and a giant model mosquito, all of which will make the museum a \"must-see place for tourists.\" 6 According to the Washington Post, CDC director Dr. Julie Gerb erding has dubbed this structure \"a metaphor\" for the new CDC. 7 The WSJ called it \"CDC's new Taj Mahal.\"8 In response to congressional inquiry, the CDC re ported that the visitor center portion of the building, which includes a scientific education and exhibit area, cost $6.9 million to construct and comprises 20,500 square feet or 10 percent of the building.9 Dr. Gerberding said \"this new building houses the distance learning capabilit ies, video and audio production facilities, conference space, and other information resources that are essential for quickly and effectively communicating CDC's science, re search and health-protection information to the many people who need it.\"10 The studio equipment, installation, and software programming cost $18.6 million, and the \"Audio Visual Integration\" equi pment, installation, and software programming cost $5.1 million.11 THERE ALREADY WAS A CDC VISITOR CENTER : The new center replaces another 3,500 square f oot CDC visitor center, in existence since 1996, which drew approximately 15,000 visitors a year.12 Called the Global H ealth Odyssey Museum, the museum was advertised as s howing visitors \"how public hea lth and the CDC's efforts reach into their daily lives\" with a mission of teaching its visitors about the CDC, public health, and the benefits of prevention.13 Emphasis was placed on increasing visitors' awareness of the role of the individual in preventing disease, injury, and death. The visitor center museum consisted of a small exhibit area w ith an attached theater and served as both a visitors' center and an interactive educational facility. The Global Health Odyssey tour began with a 5-minute introductory video and then visito rs viewed a series of four di splays illustrating CDC's work. Historic exhibits and artifacts followed, with an overview of CDC's herita ge and its development over the years. Visitors could also enter the Discovery Theater to view educational videos, demonstrations, and hear CDC volunteer speakers on a variety of topics.14 It is not clear why CDC prioriti zed its spending on a new visitor center when it already had one. CDC' S CENTER FEATURES WALL OF PLASMA 'S TV' S CALLED \"THE GLOBAL SYMPHONY \": According to the new Visitor Center's website: \"[The] Global Symphony [top right photo on previous pa ge] is an unparalleled multi- media installation highlighting the world of CDC and public health. ... Public health messages are communicated through intrigui ng narratives alternated with visual vignettes. The installation serves as an introduction to CDC and public health for all visitors. Recently, the Global Symphony featured three, three-mi nute stories that describe in depth CDC's contributions to the elimina tion of polio, the eradi cation of Legionnaire's disease, and the battle to stem the rise of obesity in the United States. The stories are 10complemented by a wide range of statistics on public health t opics ranging from HIV/AIDS to worker safety.\"15 It is unclear why an agency that is tasked with controlling and preventing diseases is spending millions of dollars budgeted for those fights on audi o visual equipment, including a wall of rear- projection and plasma television scre ens displaying \"visual vignettes.\" The 70-foot-wide by 25-foot-tall video wall is \"a very welcoming environment,\" and \"a complex ballet of light and display,\" according to Archi Tech Magazine . \"The program that would be displayed on this array of rear -projection and plasma screenage is a complex digital ballet of hundreds of video elements that play random ly ... The payoff was a unique information environment that makes what many consider to be an intimidating place at a time of global pandemic warnings a lot more welcoming.\" 16 Though the architectural community applauds its design, most taxpayers would agree a federal agency should not be working to make its l obby more welcoming, but to make its work more effective. According to the Congressional Research Service, the CDC spent more than $1 billion on construction and repairs of its buildings and facilities fr om fiscal years 2000 to 2005. 17 HARKIN CENTER EXHIBIT TEACHES ABOUT BENEFITS OF ENTHUSIASM : CDC argues that its visitor center can help educ ate Americans on healthy living. Few taxpayers would question the need for Amer icans to live healthy lives, but whether or not hosting an exhibit detailing the health bene fits of \"enthusiasm\" is the best use of CDC's resources is a question some rightfully might ask. From October 2006 through January 2007, the CDC's Ha rkin Center featured \"Through the Eyes of the Eagle: Illustrating H ealthy Living for Children\" where \"[t]hrough Native American characters and scenes, the stories engage childr en in the joys of physi cal activity and healthy living as they learn abou t diabetes prevention.\" 18 One of the components of the exhibit dealing with healthy living i nvolved \"enthusiasm.\" According to the CDC website: \"Enthusiasm can be reflected in joy, in determ ination, and in quests for learning. It can be part of keeping our bodies, minds, and spirits in balance. For many people, it has something to do with bei ng grateful for the gifts we have been given. \"It can be part of finding out what activities you like to do or want to try. People can be enthusiastic about many different things. Some are enthusiastic about dance or sports. Some people are enthus iastic about nature. They may enjoy hiking or camping. ...Others may enjoy fishing or walking along the beach. Some people are enthusiastic about go ing to school. They enjoy studying and learning many different thi ngs. ...Some people are enthusiastic about helping others. They may enjoy helping their fam ily at home or th eir neighbors in the 11 community. Some may enjoy doing voluntee r work to help people they do not know. Some people are enthusiastic about being artistic or creative. They may enjoy painting or weaving. Some ma y enjoy writing poetry or music. Enthusiasm can go up and down. And some times we have experiences that make us just very sad. Our energy and enthusiasm can get low. Remember, you are not alone.\" 19 HARKIN CENTER EXHIBIT FEATURES \"W OMAN \" MADE OF VEGETABLES Perhaps the CDC decided to invest $6.9 million in a new visitor center so it could highlight critical disease fighting tools such as a \"woman \" made out of vegetables, which was one display featured at the Harkin Center. The CDC did not simply feature this \"woman,\" but the agency actually helped pay to create the vegetable woman, though most taxpayers would put \"produce art\" on the bottom of the list of things CDC s hould be purchasing with limited federal funds. Meanwhile, CDC researchers have reported that fewer than a third of more than 300,000 people surveyed in 2005 said they at e the absolute minimum recomm ended number of fruits and vegetables, which health experts sa y should be at least five servings a day of fruit and vegetables, or, better yet, three to five servings of fruit and four to eight servings of vegetables every day. \"In 2005, approximately 32.6 percent of the U.S. adult population surveyed consumed fruit two or more times per day, and 27.2 percent ate vege tables three or more times per day,\" Heidi Blanck and colleagues wrote in the CDC's weekly report on death and disease. The authors concluded that that CDC and other agencies need to do more to persuade Americans to eat fruits and vegetables. 20 It's hard to imagine this task is accomplished by spending tax dollars to create a woman made of vegetables and putting \"her\" in the CDC's lobby in Atlanta. From January 22 through April 6, 2007, the Global Health Odyssey/Tom Hark in Global Communications Center featured an interactive exhibit entitled \"The Changing Face of Women's Health.\" The exhibit was created \"with funding from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Institutes of Health (N IH), MetLife Foundation, and Pfizer Women's Health.\" 21 ; http://www.splis.com/pdf/52dfb09be 832bffee6a9fceb542c9f30.pdf#sear ch=%22tvs%20harkin%20center%22 ; http://www.tvsa.com/index.asp . 2 February 13, 2006 HHS response letter to Senator Tom Coburn's January 11, 2006 written inquiry, signed by Charles Johnson, Office of the Secret ary, re: Building #19; Letter to the editor from Dr. Julie Gerberding, CDC Director, Wall Street Journal, December 23, 2005; Note: The building was or iginally going to be named the Visitor and Education Center according to the CDC Foundation, http://www.cdcfoundation.org/frontline/2004/helps _outfit_cdcs_new_visitor__education_center.aspx . accessed November 2006. 3 Senator Daniel Inouye ame ndment (S.Amdt. 2222) to the FY06 La bor/HHS/Education Appropriations bill (H.R. 3010), October 25, 2005, agreed to by the full Senate by voice vote. 4 \"CDC's Redesign Eyes Security, Collegiality,\" Washington Post, August 29, 2005. 5 \"Deadly Avian Spending Virus,\" Wall Street Journal, December 14, 2005. 6 Ibid. 7 Footnote 4, op. cit. 8 Footnote 5, op. cit. 9 Footnote 2, HHS response letter, op. cit. 10 Footnote 2, letter to the editor, op. cit. 11 Supra footnote 2, HHS response letter. 12 \"CDC plans snazzy new visitors center,\" The Atlanta Journal-Constitution , October 1, 2003. 13 \"Member Spotlight: Global Health Odyssey,\" E-Newsle tter of the National Association of Health Education Centers, May 31, 2002, http://www.nahec.org , accessed October 2006. 14 Ibid. 15CDC website, http://www.cdc.gov/gcc/exhibit/exhibitions_permanent.htm , accessed October 2, 2006. 16 \"Lighting The Way CDC Visitors Center; Facility de monstrates a complex ballet of light and display,\" Archi Tech Magazine , 2006, http://architechmag.com/avawards2006/visitor/ , accessed November 2006. 17 CRS response to Senator Tom Coburn's request, September 2005.

Whethe r or not taxpayers' funds are best spent on $10 million worth of top-of-the -line furniture, however, is another matter. The CDC spent $109.8 million to build the new 325,000 square foot Arlen Specter Headquarters and Emergency Operations Ce nter in Atlanta, Georgia.1 In 2005, the U.S. Senate voted to name the building after Senator Arlen Specter, a Republican from Pennsylvania, who at the time was the chairman of the appropriations committee which funds the CDC.2 According to the CDC, the new Headquarters building \"promotes coll aboration by consolida ting in one building employees from across the agency, particularly the Office of the Director, the Emergency Operations Center, and the Office of Terrorism Preparedness and Emergency Response.\"3 In response to congressional inquiry, the CDC repor ted that furniture in the Operations Center cost $9.8 million.4 According to one CDC source, this amounts to over $12,000 per person working in the building.5 CDC also reported that the buildi ng equipment systems, monitors/screens, [and] teleconferencing\" amounted to $6 million.6 According to a CDC source, TVS, the company that designed the furniture package for the building, included Scandanvian \"Randers guest chairs,\" which reportedly cost $590 each.7 According to the Congressional Re search Service, the CDC has spent more than $1 billion on building construction and repairs of its buildings and facilities from fiscal years 2000 to 2005.8 1 February 13, 2006, HHS response letter to Senator Tom Coburn's January 11, 2006 written inquiry, signed by Charles Johnson, Office of the Secretary, re: Building #21; building and room photos from architectural firm TVSA's website, http ://www.tvsa.com/index.asp , accessed October 2006. 2 Senator Daniel Inouye (D-HI) ame ndment (S.Amdt. 2222) to the FY06 La bor/HHS/Education Appropriations bill (H.R. 3010), October 25, 2005, agreed to by the full Senate by voice vote. 3 CDC website, http://www.c dc.gov/about/facilities.htm , accessed October 2006. 4 Photos from http://www.tvsa.com/index.asp ; Footnote 1, HHS response letter, op. cit., Building #21; \"furniture (chairs, tables, work stations, file cabinets, etc.) $9,872,413.\" 5 CDC Chatter, March 21, 2006 posting, http://www.cdcchatter.net/index.php?name=News&file =article&sid=100&thold=1&mode=thread&order=0 , accessed October 2006. 6 Supra footnote 1, HHS response letter, Building #21; \"equipment (audio visual systems, monitors/screens, teleconferencing) $6,014,900.\" 14 7Footnote 5, op. cit. chai rs pictured here http://moderndimension.com/en- eu/OS/catalog/seating/stacking_chairs/stacking_chairs/Also_Chair_o0.htm# , appear to match the chairs in the TVSA photo of furniture in the Specter build ing, thus seeming to confirm the posting. 8 CRS response to Senator Tom Coburn's request, September 2005. FY00-05 CDC construction and repair and \"mood enhancing\" light shows Keeping America healthy is part of the CD C's core mission. Many federal facilities, including Congress, have fitness centers for th eir employees to assist them in maintaining healthy lifestyles and many charge empl oyees to use the on-site facility.1 Some federal agencies have negotiated discounted rates for their employees at America's numerous private and non-profit sports and fitness clubs . The CDC choose to build a new state-of- the-art fitness center called th e Lifestyle Facility, located inside a $21 million, five-story building on the CDC's Atlanta campus, and give its employees free access.2 It is not necessarily the building of a new CDC fitness center that some taxpayers may question, but the decision to spend tax dollars on some of the center's more lavish attributes, such as on light shows, high-tech (and hi gh-cost) mood chairs, and saunas. The 16,000-square-foot center f eatures a large light-filled training room and over $200,000 in equipment, including more than 70 strength-training and cardiovascular- priming machines, according to the CDC and the Associated Press (AP).3 The center also features: a 12- bike indoor cycling room with images of the Tour de France and other race courses flashing on the wa lls, an aerobics room with seven Gravity Training System machines, saunas in the locker rooms, and two \"quiet rooms,\" reminiscent of \"Star Trek,\" that allow employees to sit in ze ro-gravity chairs in a dark room listening to music and viewing a panel of changing pastel lights. 4 The architecture firm TVS used bamboo and river stones \"to add extra, welcoming touches,\" according to the AP.5 In February 2006, in response to congressional inquiry regarding th e cost of the new CDC buildings, CDC told Congress \"The [f itness center] project does not fund any exercise equipment. CDC will use current fitness cent er equipment in the new space \" (emphasis added). 6 And yet, not even a year later, CDC admitted to Congress that it spent $200,000 in taxpayer funds for new fitness center equipment.7 \"No Sweat! [CDC employee] gets a sneak peek at the sauna before the opening of the new building and Lifestyle center.\" \"As you lie in the zero gravity chair in the quiet room, you can watch a mood-enhancing light show. The chair takes the stress and pressure off your joints and back.\" 16According to the CDC, its Office of H ealth and Safety purchased the $200,000 in exercise equipment from CDC's program suppor t funds. Included in that total are the following costs: 2 rotating pastel lights (pictured above) at a total cost of $2,000; 2 zero-gravity chairs at a cost of $1,750 each, for a total of $3,500; 2 \"dry-heat saunas\" (pictured a bove) at a cost of $15,000 each, $30,000 total; 1 sound system, with eight \"sound zones\" at a cost of $70,000; 12 bikes at a total cost of $9,540; 9 \"spinning certifications\" at a total cost of $2,249.558; and 7 Gravity Training System machines at a cost of $2,895 each, for a total cost of $21,143.9 According to a CDC employee newsletter, th e quiet rooms \u2014 which are to be made available by appointment \u2014 have \"music, and mood lighting, and each has a chair that is designed with a 'zero gravity' seating positi on which helps to relieve muscle tension, increase circulation and reduce pressure on your heart and spine. As you lie in the zero gravity chair in the quiet room, you can watch a mood-enhancing light show.\" One employee who had tested the light show reporte d, \"They change from green to blue, very soothing. Color can really affect your mood.\" 10 In response to congressional inquir y, CDC defended these expenditures: \"The rotating pastel lights, sound syst em, sauna and zero gravity chairs are facility attributes that enhance the ov erall health and welln ess experience for patrons. ...CDC's new fitness center adhe res to Federal guidelines for fitness facilities and is considered a modest fac ility by government and corporate sector standards. ...The rotating pastel lights, sound system, sauna and zero gravity chairs are comparable to health and welln ess attributes at De partment of Defense [DOD] Naval Installations at Bremert on and Bangor, the Ho me Depot Wellness Center, the YMCA - Buckhead in Atlanta, Blue Cross Blue Shield and Merrill Lynch.\"11 Some taxpayers might question why a taxpa yer-funded agency with a limited budget and a mission of fiscal accountability is modeling its fitness center on those of private, for- profit companies. In addition, the DOD Brem erton and Bangor facilities mentioned as models for the new CDC fitness center do no t appear to have gone through the regular funding process, but were instead funded throug h the earmarks of their home state's U.S. Senator.12 Earmarked projects are not subject to the regular federal ov ersight process and the process of earmarking has recently come under intense scrutiny, in part because it diverts funds from agency priorities to projects labeled home-state \"pork.\" Of the 15,000 CDC employees and contract wo rkers, the gym now sees visits from approximately 600 employees a month. 13 The new facility replaced an older, out-of-date gym that had only three treadmills (compared to the eight in the new facility), and reportedly frequently had at least one out of order. 17 A CDC spokesman told the AP, \"We want this to become a model for companies and others to copy.\"14 The CDC newsletter predicted, \"From quiet, meditation rooms for relaxation, to wonderful outdoor spaces fo r walking and stretching, to the massive strength and cardio areas, this center will turn heads for certain!\"15 Taxpayers might well question whether or not the CDC's mission of fighting and preventing diseases includes designing employee fitness centers that will turn heads, or be models for private companies. 1 Congress, unlike the CDC, charges its employees for use of the gym. 2 \"CDC Practices What It Preaches,\" CDC Connects (employee newsletter), July 19, 2006; photo captains taken directly from newsletter. 3 E-mail correspondence from HHS Legisl ative Affairs to the office of Sena tor Tom Coburn, dated December 8, 2006; \"CDC Opens Model Employee Fitness Center,\" The Associated Press (AP) , November 27, 2006. 4 AP, Ibid. 5 Id. 6 February 13, 2006 HHS response letter to Senator Tom Coburn's January 11, 2006 written inquiry, signed by Charles Johnson, Office of the Secretary, re: Building #20. 7 Footnote 3, e-mail correspondence, op. cit. 8 Spinning is a type of exercise class that uses stationa ry bicycles.

CDC is on track to do both with a recent announcement that the agency is likely opening a university-affiliated office in Honolulu that may serve as a model for other CDC-university affiliated offices. CDC WEST: A MILE FROM WAIKIKI ? At the suggestion of a former CDC employee, and current University of Hawaii Institute director Duane Gubler, CDC officials traveled to Hawaii to discuss the possibility of the agency opening an office in Honolulu in the summer of 2007. CDC would partner with the University of Hawaii, whose main campus is located just a mile fr om the famous Waikiki beach. The CDC is interested in the Hawaiian locat ion, according to a CDC official who visited, because of its proximity to Asian and Pacific nations and also because it hopes to collaborate with the NIH-funded secure laboratory at the medical school's Asia-Pacific Inst itute of Tropical Medicine and Infectious Diseases. 1 Gubler, who suggested the Hawaii-CDC partnershi p, was director of the CDC's Fort Collins, Colorado, infectious disease labo ratory before joining Hawaii's medical school three years ago, where he currently serves as Director of the Asia-Pacific Institute of Tropical Medicine and Infectious Diseases. 2 News reports indicate Gubler is considered a national authority on infectious disease, and he told a reporter that he was working with his former colleagues to develop a business plan \"to move ahead with CDC West and to embed a CDC office\" at the Institute he directs. 3 SENATOR ANNOUNCES CDC SAYS \"ALOHA \" TO TROPICAL ISLAND OUTPOST : That this new CDC office would be located in Hawaii, the state of the second highest ranking Senator on the committee that funds the CDC, could be just a coincidence. 19It also could be a coincidence that the same Sena tor, Senator Daniel Inouye (D-HI), was first to announce the finalization of what had been reported as a proposal. Hawaii news reported on April 10, 2007, that CDC was contemplating an office in Hawaii. On April 19, 2007, Senator Inouye issued a press release en titled, \"Centers for Disease Co ntrol and Prevention to Set up 'Forward Base' in Hawaii to Strengthen As ia-Pacific Disease De tection and Response.\"4 The release stated the Senator had been informed by the Director of the CDC that it was opening an office in his home state. This office is not the first time CDC and Hawaii ha ve teamed up; evidently the first project was done at the request of the Senator. \"Several years ago, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, at Senator Inouye's request , established a small occupational health center at the University of Hawaii at Hilo,\" the press release no ted (emphasis added). \"It has taken the lead in addressing the public health implications of volcano emissions and childhood asthma.\" 5 A SMALL STATE AND UNIVERSITY CONTINUE TO RECEIVE TOP DOLLAR IN EARMARKS : \"While the funding and the location of the [new] fi eld station still need to be worked out, it is clear that the CDC is committed to expanding its Asia-Pacific focus with Hawaii having a key role,\" Senator Inouye said. 6 Senator Inouye sits on the appropriations committee that funds the CDC, and will likely play a large role in securing funds for an agency under his jurisdiction to start an outpost in the state he represents. It appears Hawaii and its univers ity may have benefited from Se nator Inouye's appropriations committee seat in the past: The State of Hawaii received $432.7 million in earmarks in fiscal year 2005, which earned it the third-highest ra nking in earmarks per capita.7 In fiscal year 2005, the University of Ha waii was ranked eighth among the top earmark recipients in the entire nation, receiving $87.8 million from congressional appropriators.8 In 2003, the University of Hawaii-Manoa wa s ranked fourth among the \"Top Recipients of Pork\" because it received $30.6 million in earmarks from congres sional appropriators.9 In response to congressional i nquiry, CDC reported that in gran ts and contracts (not including the vaccines for children program) the state of Hawaii received a total of $22.2 million from the CDC in 2006. This amount included $818,349 for infectious disease and over $8 million for terrorism preparedness and emergency response. 10 UNIVERSITY DOESN 'T TRACK EARMARKS ... UNLESS THEY ARE BEING \"CUT\": On September 25, 2006, the University of Hawa ii (the location for the CDC's new office) responded to a congressional inquiry requesting a detailed list of a nd amount of federal appropriations earmarked to the University since 2000. The University wrote: \"We do not maintain a separate list of congressi onally directed appropriations [earmarks] at the University of Hawaii. We do maintain a listing of all Federal contracts and grants received that includes congressionally direct ed appropriations and competitively awarded 20contracts and grants. However, we do not annotate whether the contract or grant received is a result of a congressionally directed appropriation or a successful application to a competitive solicitation\" (emphasis added).11 Yet by March 5, 2007, (not even six months later) after Congress passed the fiscal year 2007 funding bill largely without earmarks, the Univ ersity of Hawaii's main campus at Manoa suddenly could track how many earmarks it received in fiscal year 2006 down to the exact dollar amount and specific grant number. The University was not tracking the earmarks to notify or even update the inquiring oversight committee in Congress, but to report on how much it stood to \"lose\" in federal funding because Congress funded the 2007 fiscal ye ar under a continuing resolution. The University claimed the absence of earmarks in the continuing resolution equaled a \"net loss\" of over $8 million for the campus from 2006 to 2007 \u2014 though no explanation wa s given as to why it assumed funds for 2006 earmarks would continue in 2007, when earma rks, by definition, are line-items added to one-year appropriations bills by Members of Congress. Though the University told Congress in 2006 that it did not track wh ether its grants or contracts were received as earmarks, not only did the Univer sity of Hawaii at Manoa report that it received $9,241,171 in fiscal year 2006 earmarks, but it actually titled the document \"CTAHR_Loss_of_Earmarks.pdf.\" 12 POLITICIAN KNEW BEFORE INSTITUTE : Raising additional questions about how and why CDC made its decision to open a new Hawaiian office, news reports indicate that those at th e future home of the CDC Hawaiian outpost first learned a decision had been made through the pr ess release of their home-state Senator. According to the Star Bulletin , \"Dr. Duane Gubler, director of the University of Hawaii's Asia- Pacific Institute for Tropical Medicine and Inf ectious Diseases, said he did not know of the decision until he saw [Senator Inouy e's] news release. 'I wasn't in the loop in discussions with the senator, so it caught me by surprise, but it's the kind of surprise you'd like to receive,' he said.\"13 CDC OFFICIAL SAYS IT'S HARD TO WORK WITH OTHER COUNTRIES \"FROM ATLANTA \": BUT CDC SENT EMPLOYEES ABROAD UNDER SAME JUSTIFICATION : Michael Sage, CDC's portfolio management project director who visited the Hawaii site, said opening a Hawaii office would help the agency ra pidly detect and res pond quickly to emerging threats and would help CDC work more clos ely with other countri es on responding to emergencies and building closer working relation ships with them. \"That's hard to do from Atlanta,\" he said.14 Sage told The Honolulu Advisor that CDC representatives in Ha waii could provide a front line for the agency and travel to areas in Asia and the Pacific more quickly than those coming from the headquarters. 15 This \"front line\" reportedly is goi ng to start with two CDC employees in Hawaii, even though dozens of CDC employees ar e already stationed in the countries and regions Sage discussed. For example, CDC curre ntly has officials stationed in Asia and the Pacific, many under this same front-line rationale. CDC also spends $3 million a year in 21taxpayer funds to lease a private jet for emergency travel, which the agency reports has helped get employees on location faster.16 In 2001, CDC told Congress that it had full- or part-time employees stationed with outside agencies in Asia and the Pacific, including in Ch ina, India, Vietnam, Korea, the Philippines, Thailand, Bangladesh, Cambodia, Indonesia, and Nepal. 17 These \"outside agency\" CDC employees join an unreported number of employees at official CDC offices, which are located in countries such as China.18 In response to congressional inquiry, to date CDC has not been able to provide documentation that describes a Hawaii office or any other office between mainland U.S. and Asia as part of its disease control and prevention planning. Nor ha s CDC been able to provide any documentation that such offices were included in or envisi oned in any of the agency's strategic plans. 19 In addition, a new office is not in the President' s fiscal year 2007 or 2008 budget, though news reports say the Hawaii office could ope n as early as the summer of 2007. OFFICE INITIALLY MAY HOUSE STAFF OF TWO, BUT FUTURE EXPANSION EYED: According to news reports, if a proposal to partner with the University of Hawaii's medical school is approved, the CDC will base a manager and medical epidemiologist in Honolulu. Reports also note the possibility of a future expansion of th e Hawaii office staff, including relocating CDC training and technica l personnel to the tropical island.20 CDC's Sage told the Honolulu Advertiser , \"CDC has never had a similar partnership with a university and it could serve as a mo del for others if successful.\" Once universities around the country (and their ho me-state politicians) ge t word that the CDC will set up outposts on college campuses, it is not hard to imagine the outposts multiplying exponentially, along with CDC's budget request a nd number of full-time federal employees. Simply locating offices at universities in the st ates of every Member of the House and Senate Appropriations Committee (the committee that ov ersees CDC's budget) would fill the national landscape with CDC outposts. If asserting a public hea lth interest is all that is needed to start a CDC office a mile from Waikiki beach, taxpaye rs should bunker down for big financial waves on the horizon. 1 \"CDC mulls opening Hawaii facility,\" United Press International (UPI) , April 10, 2007. 2 Ibid. 3 Id.; \"CDC eyes Hawaii as key defense for outbreaks: The federal agency would partner with UH to create an early warning system ,\" Star Bulletin , April 14, 2007. 4 Senator Daniel Inouye's press release, date d April 19, 2007, http://www.inouye.senate.gov/ , accessed April 2007. 5 Ibid. 6 Id. 7 Porkbusters' extrapolation of White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) list of 2005 appropriations earmarks, http://porkbusters.org/2007/04/omb_releases_earmark_data_fun.php#comments Politics: Top Recipients of Pork,\" The Chronicle of Higher Education , September 26, 2003. 10 \"CDC Funds for State and Local Health Departments, Un iversities, & Other Public and Private Agencies\" Draft FY2006, provided by HHS legislative to the Office of Senator Tom Coburn, ranking member of the Federal Financial Management Subcommittee. 11 Letter from University of Hawaii President David McClain to Senator Tom Coburn, Chairman of the Subcommittee on Federal Financial Management, Government Information, and International Security, dated September 25, 2006, http://coburn.senate.gov/ffm/index. cfm?FuseAction=Files.View&F ileStore_id=3c5fba3f-26d9- 46ff-ab17-45b1c6224f74 in response to request from Senator dated July 27, 2006, http://coburn.senate.gov/ffm/index.cfm?FuseAction= Files.View&FileStore_id=f 3737254-4808-4d32-a4c3- 9c3e09c6ce9f . 12 \"Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service Comparison of Actual FY 2006 and Estimated FY 2007,\" document posted on University of Hawaii at Manoa's website, dated March 5, 2007, http://www.ctahr.hawaii.edu/vincent/ earmarks/CTAHR_Loss_of_Earmarks.pdf , accessed April 2007. 13 \"CDC picks isles as epidemic outpost; The U.S. Center s for Disease Control and Prevention will put Hawaii at the forefront of a disease war,\" Star Bulletin , April 20, 2007. 14 \"CDC discusses Isle lab with UH med school, The Honolulu Advertiser , April 10, 2007. 15 Ibid. 16 \"Cabinet official is primary user of CDC jet,\" The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, June 16, 2006; \"CDC Plane Decreases Response Time, Increases Readiness,\" CDC website document, last modified June 14, 2006, http://www.bt.cdc.gov/planning/cdc_plane.asp , accessed April 2007. 17 Letter from CDC Director Jeffrey Koplan, M.D., to Repr esentative Mark Souder, dated April 26, 2001, which lists full- and part-time CDC employees stationed with \"outside agencies\" in Asia and the Pacific. 18 \"Most Chinese HIV-AIDS ca ses unaware of infection,\" AFP wire in Taipei Times, March 3, 2004. 19 Multiple e-mail and phone contacts between CDC legislativ e affairs and the Office of Senator Tom Coburn, April 2007. 20Footnote 13, op. cit. 23 CDC TARGETS DISEASES ... RESULTS STILL PENDING : CDC Versus HIV/AIDS $5 Billion over Seven Years in Prevention Funding Includes International Junkets, Fr aud, & \"Widespread Deficiencies\" Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) is a communicable in fection that causes the disease Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS), a nd one of the top-funded diseases at CDC. The agency will spend $837 million on domestic HIV/AIDS activities in FY2007, according to the HHS Budget Office.1 Each year CDC is given more than three-quarters of a billion dollars to fight and prevent HIV and AIDS in the U.S., and yet after spending billions of dollars, CDC year after year continues to report to Congress that an estimated 40 ,000 people are infected with HIV annually. 2 This number of new infections has rema ined unchanged for 12 years. Taxpayers are justified in asking if infection rates are not changing, what has th is agency \u2014 tasked with the nationwide prevention of HIV/AI DS \u2014 done with the $5 billion do mestic HIV/AIDS prevention budget it has received and spent over the past seven years?3 The answer lies in a complicated morass of politic s and missing statistics, as well as a lack of internal accountability and overs ight procedures. Like few di seases, HIV/AIDS funding levels are highly politicized, with attempts to modify funding or even question grant expenditures being met with extremely heavy resistance and freque nt ad hominem attacks on the questioner (one AIDS activist called those attempting to do oversight on prevention funding \"right-wing jihadists\"). 4 Even standard oversight practices, such as auditing gr antees' financial records, expected practice in other industries, are met among HIV/AIDS grantees with public relations campaigns and cries to the media of partisan attacks.5 Every year CDC presents its budget request to th e congressional appropriations committee, and every year, the witnesses testify that HIV/AIDS is a horrible, yet mostly preventable, disease plaguing our nation. The agency and the administ ration then request addi tional or level funding for domestic prevention efforts. Past financial irregularities and lack of measurably successful outcomes (such as a reduced rate of infections) do not appear to affect the funding level, or politicians' eagerness to direct f unds toward fighting the disease. This environment helps to continue the cycle of what some call AIDS \"exceptionalism\" and the creation of an \"AIDS industry\" that has grown up around and makes a living off government funding. 6 Inspector General and budget reports have que stioned how CDC spends its HIV/AIDS funding, whether the agency was measuring success as reducing the rate of HIV/AIDS, or whether \"success\" to the CDC meant merely detailing how the agency spent all the funds it received from the taxpayers. Recently the agency has be gun to reform by announcing goals and performance measures to account for the billions of dollars appropriated. Congress has responded to the lack of statistics by requiring that by 2011, states report the di sease's case numbers in a uniform manner. Meanwhile, the CDC's latest request fo r HIV/AIDS domestic prevention funding is an increase over its previous year funding. 24$5 BILLION OVER SEVEN YEARS IN CDC PREVENTION FUNDING : In FY2007, federal government spending on HIV/AIDS is estimated to be $23.3 billion, including $15.4 billion on treatment and $2.7 billion on prevention. 7 Approximately 93 percent of FY2007 HHS discreti onary funding for HIV/AIDS is allocated to three HHS agencies: CDC, which supports HIV/AIDS prevention programs; the National Institutes of Health (NIH), which supports HIV/AIDS research ; and the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), which administers the Ryan White CARE Act, an HIV/AIDS care, services, and treatment program. 8 In FY2007, HIV/AIDS programs within HHS acc ount for 71 percent of federal HIV/AIDS spending, a total of $16.5 billion for both discretionary and ent itlement programs. Within the HHS discretionary budget, funding for HIV/AIDS research, prevention, and treatment programs has increased from $200,000 in FY1981 to an estimated $6.2 billion in FY2007. 9 CDC will be spending $837 million on HIV/AIDS activities in FY2007, according to the HHS Budget Office. 10 (Note: This total includes the foll owing accounts not included in Figure 2 below: Infectious Diseases Control, Chr onic Disease Prevention, Health Promotion, and Genomics, and Birth Defects, Developmental Disabilities, Disabil ity and Health.) The $837 million figure does not include the almost $123 million that comes to CDC as part of the Global AIDS Program. 11 Nor does the total, it is wort h repeating, include the $815 million it has already received from the Department of State's Office of the Global AIDS Coordinator (OGAC) nor any additional funds in FY07.12 CDC does not \"count\" these hundreds of millions of dollars from OGAC when releasing its budget, which has the potential to mislead researchers and taxpayers alike when they try to determin e how much money CDC ha s been allocated to fight HIV/AIDS.\"13 Figure 2. CDC's Domestic HIV/AI DS Funding by Fiscal Year Appropriations Administrative Costs Assumed Administrative Costs FY08 Budget Request 25CHANGE IN BUDGET CALCULATIONS COMPLICATES YEAR-TO-YEAR COMPARISONS : In fiscal year 2004, CDC adjusted its budget calcul ation process; no longer listing administrative and management costs for HIV/AIDS in the HI V/AIDS budget. Instead, those costs now are counted elsewhere, thus complicating subseque nt year-to-year HIV/AIDS budget comparisons. The Congressional Research Service reported CDC' s administrative and management costs for HIV/AIDS in FY04 and FY05, based on CDC' s unpublished, internal calculations. Subsequently, CDC stopped calculating and providing such figures and thus FY06-FY08 administrative and management costs are unavailable.15 For Figure 2 above, it is assumed that administrative costs for the CDC's HIV/AIDS pr ograms have remained constant since FY05. Figure 3. HHS Discretionary SETS AND MISSES 5-Y EAR GOAL TO CUT HIV IN HALF: In January 2001, the CDC announced its \"three-par t plan to cut annual HIV infections in the United States in half within five years.\" Th e agency sought to reduce by half the number of Americans who contract HIV each y ear, from 40,000 people to 20,000 people.17 In 2006, CDC testified before Congress that there are still an estimated 40,000 people a year infected with HIV.18 In other words, the CDC goal has not yet b een met; in fact the number of new infections has remained unchanged, despite billions in domestic expenditures. CDC STILL DOES NOT KNOW HOW MANY AMERICANS HAVE HIV: Though the CDC is able to come up with sta tistics on how many Americ ans are bitten by dogs each year (4.7 million), it cannot report how many Americans currently are living with HIV.19 According to the CDC, approximately 40,000 new pe ople in the United States become infected 26with HIV each year.20 That estimate has been repeated in CDC statistics since 1995, regardless of federal HIV spending.21 Year after year, CDC releases volumes of data on HIV and AIDS, including estimated rates of infection for certain areas and states and rates of infection among racial and gender subgroups, but nowhere in these reports does CDC release th e numbers of Americans infected with virus that causes AIDS. In June 1988, a Presidential Commission on the HI V epidemic reported to President Ronald Reagan that CDC was an \"obstacle to progress\" in HIV. The Commission noted a \"Lack of strong CDC leadership in the public health community for obtaining and coordinating HIV infection data.\" 22 The 1988 Commission recommended that every \"reas onable effort\" be made to increase the precision of the HIV prevalence a nd infection rate. Despite year s of CDC funding to fight HIV, the Commission wrote that \"As of March 1988, CD C acknowledged that a precise statement of the prevalence and rate of spr ead of HIV infection in the general population is still not available.\" And yet, almost 20 years later, CDC still does not have an act ual count of Americans living with HIV, and still relies on an estim ate for the number of new annual infections. In 2005, at a national HIV prevention conference , CDC released two possible estimates for calculating HIV and AIDS cases from two years earlier. One of the estimates calculated that \"at the end of 2003 an estimated 1,039,000 to 1,185,000 pers ons in the United States were living with HIV/AIDS, with 24-27% undiagnosed and una ware of their HIV infection. Of these, 417,000 persons were living with HIV (not AIDS), 415,000 were living with AIDS, and 252,000-312,000 were undiagnosed.\" 23 This estimate is freque ntly used by HIV/AIDS groups and it has been repeated by CD C in congressional testimony. AFTER 20 YEARS OF FUNDING , NO UNIFORM STATE REPORTING OF HIV CASES : The CDC does not know how many Americans ha ve HIV because despite over 20 years of federal funding to support states' efforts to track the disease, there curren tly is not a uniform, nationwide reporting system for HIV cases. This ha s been due, in part, to the fact that some states adopted different repor ting protocols for HIV rather than following long-standing protocols for reporting cases of communicable disease. In 1998, 20 states and the District of Columbia had their own coded system for recording confirmed HIV cases using, for example, patients' in itials, or social securi ty numbers to create a coded record. 24 Reportedly these code-based systems were adopted under the political pressure of AIDS activists who claimed that due to the stigma surrounding HIV/AIDS in the early years of the disease, there was a fear that name -based reporting would discourage HIV testing.25 Instead of trying to require confidential, na me-based reporting for HIV cases, CDC actually opposed congressional legislation to implement it nationwide. De spite the fact that since the 1980s, all states have reported AIDS cases to the CDC under a confidential, name-based reporting protocol, in 1998, Helene Gayle, Director of the CDC's National Center for HIV, STD, and TB Prevention, testified before Congress th at proposed legislation requiring name-based reporting for HIV cases \"would not add further pub lic health benefit.\" She testified that the 27legislation \"departs from the CDC Guidelines and science-based publ ic health practice by mandating reporting of all HIV-positive tests, by client name, without any provision to support the continuation of anonymous te sting.\" When Gayle was asked how many states had reported breaches of confidentiality in name-based te sting, she admitted that none had reported any breaches.26 At the same time the agency was testifying against more accurate, name-based reporting methods, CDC itself would not count HIV reports fr om states if they did not come in following confidential, name-based reporting protocols. The agency left the coded reports out of its statistics due to concerns there was double c ounting of HIV patients a nd the fact that the different codes could not be reconciled with the name-based reporting system. 27 Before the reauthorization of the Ryan White Care Act in 2000, HRSA distributed funding to states through a formula using CDC data on AIDS cases in each state, because every state used a names-based system for AIDS reporting, unlike HI V reporting. This had the effect of some areas getting more HIV/AIDS funding even tho ugh their AIDS patients may have already died, while areas with high numbers of HIV cases which had not progressed to AIDS in large numbers, were not receiving ad equate treatment funds for th eir patients due to the funding calculations. In 2000, Congress requ ired that HIV data (from name s-based reporting states only) be included for fiscal year 2007 Ryan White f unding allocations. This deadline was delayed for some states with certain circumstances. As of December 2005, only 37 states reported thei r HIV/AIDS cases in a names-based reporting system which was tallied by CDC. 28 Thirteen states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico used a coded system and these 15 jurisdictions, according to one report, might have accounted for almost one-third of all AIDS cases in 2002 (28.7 percent).29 In other words, the CDC was collecting records but no t counting perhaps one third of all Americans with HIV/AIDS due to how the data were being reported. In December 2005, CDC sent a letter to governors of all the non-names-based reporting states warning, \"Data from non-name-based systems cannot be included in the counts for the [Ryan White HIV/AIDS federal funding] formulas. Ther efore, states that us e non-name-based systems are at risk for losi ng federal dollars.\" J UST AN EDUCATED GUESS ON NUMBERS FOR FIVE MORE YEARS : Starting in 2011, the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Tr eatment Modernization Act of 2006 conditions federal HIV/AIDS funds on states having name-b ased reporting of HIV/AIDS cases, not code- based systems.30 Facing the loss of millions of dollars, most jurisdictions reportedly will work to switch their systems, though such a switc h will be costly and time-consuming.31 States have slowly come into compliance with HIV reporting protocols and as of December 2006, 51 areas (46 states and five territories ) were conducting HIV surveillance using confidential, name-based methods. 32 According to the Associated Press , \"The names of people infected with HIV will be tracked in all 50 states by the end of 2007.\" Illinois switched to names-based reporting in 2006, Massachusetts switched in January 2007 and the remaining three states: Vermont, Maryland and 28Hawaii, are quickly moving toward adopting name s-based surveillance. That more than $1.4 billion will be distributed in 2007 based on the names-based fundi ng formula is credited with the switch of the final hold-out states.33 Despite the CDC's yearly budget of over $800 million to track and prevent th e spread of HIV in the U.S., until the states and territories all report uniformly, there will only be estimates of how many Americans live with HIV. The most recent estimate currently availa ble is for three years ago, and that estimate varies by 150,000 people, or more than 10 pe rcent of the cases. HISTORICAL ESTIMATES FOR U.S. HIV INFECTIONS : In response to congressional inquiry, CDC rel eased a graph which shows the estimated HIV infection prevalence. HIV prevalence includes all people with HIV infec tion who are alive at a given point in time, whether or not they have pr ogressed to AIDS. In addition to the estimated new HIV transmissions each year, newer drug ther apies are helping people with HIV and AIDS to live longer, a fact which contributes to some of the increases shown. FIGURE 4. PEOPLE IN THE U.S. LIVING WITH HIV/AIDS 34 29 FIGURE 5. PEOPLE IN THE U.S. LIVING WITH HIV/AIDS & YEARLY NEW HIV CASES 35 Figure 5 was included in the CDC's 2006 test imony before Congress. The light blue line shows the estimated incidence rate, wh ich is how many new people each year are estimated to have contracted HIV. Acco rding to the CDC's testimony, an estimated 40,000 people contract the disease each year, a statistic that has held steady since 1995. 30FIGURE 6. 480,000 NEW HIV INFECTIONS IN 12 YEARS According to unpublished CDC data, the HIV/AIDS prevalence in 1995 was estimated to be 903,265 cases. This means that according to CDC estimates, in 1995, over nine-hundred thousand people in the U.S. had HIV, whethe r or not the virus ha d progressed to AIDS.36 In 2006, CDC testified before Congress that each ye ar an estimated 40,000 new people are infected with HIV in the U.S.37 The flat HIV incidence line in Figure 5 may be read by the casual observer as if the infection rate is holding steady and therefore is und er control. But in actuality, it is an inexcusable failure that despite billions of dollars in CDC HIV prev ention efforts, each year an estimated 40,000 new people in the U.S. contract HIV, a communicable and preventable disease. 38 The full impact of 40,000 new infections each year is more clearly evident in Figure 6, which demonstrates the cumulative effect of 40,000 new HIV infections each and every year. This is not an epidemic that has \"stabilized,\" as some have suggested, bu t rather an epidemic th at continues to spread unabated. 39 Using CDC statistics, over the 12 years shown, an estimated 480,000 people in the United States contracted HIV. Figure 6 does not purport to show how many pe ople were living with an HIV infection that had not progressed to AIDS, because CDC does not have those numbers or historical estimates and it is possible that some of the 40,000 ne wly infected people each year progressed to AIDS and died and or died of some other cause. Currently, CDC can only provide a one year 2003 estimate of those with only HIV (as discussed above), or a historical estimate that combines HIV and AIDS cases (HIV prevalence shown in Figures 4 and 5). 31CDC' S GLOBAL AIDS FUNDING : In FY2000, for the first time, Congress provide d $34.8 million for CDC's Global AIDS Program (GAP), and an additional $11.9 million for globa l HIV prevention and research through the FY2000 emergency supplemental appropriatio ns. In FY2001, Congress appropriated $104.5 million to CDC's GAP (of which $3 million was committed to Health Resources and Services Administration's (HRSA) International Traini ng and Education Center on HIV). In FY2002, funding increased again to $143.7 million. Congress provided about the same level of funding in FY2003: $142.6 million for GAP and an additional $40 million for the Prevention of Mother-to- Child HIV Transmission (PMTCT) Initiative. Funding for GAP remained about the same in FY2004; when it received $142.7 million and an additional $149.1 million for the PMTCT Initiative. 40 These funding figures are in addition to global HIV/AIDS funding transferred from OGAC and totaling over $2 billion in the past FY2004: FY2007: $815 million so far (a figure that is likely to increase, according to the CDC). 41 HIV/AIDS PREVENTION EQUALS INTERNATIONAL TRIPS, FRAUD , & \"W IDESPREAD DEFICIENCIES \" The topics summarized below each appear in further detail in subsequent se ctions of this report: Taxpayer-Funded \"Prevention\" Ac tivities (see pages 42-47): CDC has used its prevention funds to support HI V/AIDS organizations, some of which have very targeted HIV/AIDS prevention missions. Reports indicate some of these groups have used taxpayer HIV/AIDS prevention dollars to hold transgender beauty contests, zoo trips, and classes where men are taught how to flirt and write erotically, am ong other activities. Conference Talk Isn't Cheap: In response to congressional inquiry, HHS reported that from FY2000 through FY2005, the CDC spent a total of $44.7 million on conferen ces, which includes its HIV/AIDS conference costs.42 CDC has spent millions on conferences, sending more than 500 CDC employees to international HIV/AIDS conferences, includ ing 157 employees to Vancouver, 90 to Barcelona and 20 to Thailand (down from th e 48 originally schedul ed to attend). Conference Circuit (see pages 48-60): Recent HIV/AIDS conferences supported by and attended by the CDC, its employees, and its grantees have been described as \"boisterous political circuses\" for the AIDS industry, and those in it that make a living off HIV and AIDS. 43 Some examples of CDC attended and funded conferences include: A 2002 Barcelona conference that cost U.S. taxpayers $3.6 million (in HHS costs alone, not including expenditures by USAID and th e State Department), where the U.S. Secretary of HHS was shouted down by prot estors during his speech. Also in the 32audience were 236 HHS attendees, includi ng 90 CDC attendees, though the Vatican, which through its Catholic facilities runs 26 percent of all AIDS treatment centers in the world and treats one-in-ever y-four AIDS patients, wa s not invited to attend.44 A 2003 CDC-funded conference in New Or leans featuring a sexually graphic \"entertainment\" segment about the Vice Presid ent of the United States and a workshop on how to defund abstinence education.45 Taxpayers paid at least $300,000 for this prevention conference and the HIV/AIDS pr evention group hosting the conference, the National Minority AIDS Council (NMAC), r eceived $4.7 million in federal funds the same year as the conference. 46 A 2004 Thailand conference attended by 17,000 delegates included more than 130 U.S. federal employees, 20 of whom were CDC em ployees (not including employees stationed in Asia).47 The event also featured Brazilian dr esses made of condoms, a drag show, art shows, and fashion parades. A 2006 Toronto conference, attended by 26,000 people, including 78 HHS employees (of whom many were CDC employees), which cost U.S. taxpayers $315,000.48 The conference included presentations from resear chers who said countries must recognize prostitution as \"legitimate legal work.\"49 One convention center exhibit featured three prostitutes lying on a satin-covered bed, which was designed to \"look like a typical workplace.\"50 One prostitute from Thailand was de scribed as \"standing amid pillows and sex toys in the [conference's Stiletto] L ounge. To cheers from a crowd of around 200 people, she demanded health insuran ce, paid vacation and job security.\"51 The conference also featured a workshop on findi ng a woman's erotic zone, one on how to apply condoms through \"sex stunts,\" and a disp lay of explicit artwor k, all of which were described as \"hugely popular\" at the 16th International AIDS Conference.52 A fall 2006 conference in Hollywood, Florida, drew 3,500 people, of whom 92 were federal employees, including 67 from the CD C. The HIV/AIDS prevention conference cost U.S. taxpayers over $410,000 and, among other things, included a session on lobbying, a Latin Fiesta featur ing a \"sizzling fashion show ,\" and a beach party that included a 15-foot-high sand sculpture of the CDC-funded sponsor's logo. 53 The executive director of the conference's spons or, NMAC (a group that in 2004 received $3.9 million in government funds and spen t $1.4 million on conferences and $1 million on consultants), questioned the governme nt's commitment to HIV/AIDS funding.54 Funds for Three International Trips to Talk About HIV Could Have Spared 150,000 Infants From HIV (see pages 50, 52, and 54): If the funds CDC spent to register 20 employ ees for a Thailand conference and to send 90 employees to a Barcelona conference to talk about HIV/AIDS, had instead been used to buy and administer Nevirapine (a retroviral drug that co sts less than $4 a dose and has proven to prevent HIV transmission from mother to child with the administration of just two doses), more than 115,000 infants around th e world could have been spared from HIV infection. This does not count the more than 40,000 infants that could have avoided HIV infection if HHS had not sent 78 empl oyees (including an undetermined number of CDC employees) to Toronto to talk about HIV/AI DS at a cost to the federal taxpayers of 33over $300,000. For the cost of these three inte rnational conferences alone, more than 150,000 newborns could have been treated with Nevirapine and prevented from contracting HIV. UNAIDS estimates that 1,800 children worldwid e become infected with HIV each day, the vast majority of whom are newborns. 55 UNAIDS estimates that in 2005, just less than eight percent of pregnant women in lo w- and middle-income c ountries had access to services that could prevent the tr ansmission of HIV to their babies.56 Inspector General Uncovers Significant Problems Among $2.6 Billion HIV/AIDS Prevention Grants (see pages 38-40): CDC's HIV/AIDS prevention grants were found to have \"widespread deficiencies\" during fiscal years 1999 through 2003 \u2014 during which time more than $2.6 billion was awarded by CDC for state and local HIV/AIDS grants. Th ese findings, contained in a September 2005 HHS Inspector General (IG) repo rt, show a pattern of mismanagement, a lack of oversight, and in one documented ex ample, a willingness of a CDC employee to make up grantee accomplishments simply to keep his projects running.57 According to the IG report, \"Awards for 14 of the 15 grants lacked clear, specifi c objectives providing a basis for assessing grantees' accomplishmen ts, and, in fact, 2 of those 14 grants contained no objectives at all.\" IG Finds HIV/AIDS Grantees Misuse CDC F unds, Including to Lobby (see pages 84-86): The HHS IG found a possible misuse of federa l HIV/AIDS funds in its audit of the CDC- funded Multicultural AIDS Cent er (MAC) of Boston, Massachuset ts. Over the course of two years, MAC received $948,000 from the CDC: $408,000 during 2001 and $180,000 during 2002 from CDC via the Commonwealth of Massachusetts Department of Public Health's HIV/AIDS Prevention & Educa tion Cooperative Agreement, and $360,000 in fiscal year 2002 from the CDC under th e Community Coalition Development (CCD) Project.58 According to the IG audit released in January 2003, \"two MAC employees, whose salaries were paid with CD C funds, appeared to be invol ved in lobbying activities \u2014 an unallowable charge under federal regulations. ...[I]t is possible that a portion of the [FY02] total charges of $360,000 to the CD C's Community Coalition Development Project may have supported unall owable lobbying activities...\" The misused CDC funds had been inteded \"to sustain, improve, and expand HIV prevention services for racial/ethnic minority populations.\" 59 Another IG investigation involved the Washington, D.C.-based National Latina/o Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Or ganization (LLEGO), which was awarded a five-year CDC HIV/AIDS education grant, including a first-year 2004 grant of $1.15 million. In August 2004, five months after it received its federal grant, LLEGO closed its doors and filed for Chapter 7 bankruptc y after drawing down $989,255 of its CDC funds.60 The federal government is seeking to reclaim more than $700,000 from LLEGO in bankruptcy court, though it has so far been an unsuccessful effort.61 34The HHS Inspector General determined LLEGO had incurred $703,181 in \"unallowable costs,\" instead of on the promised HIV/AIDS education efforts. \"LLEGO engaged in activities not covered by CDC's progr am announcement, including lobbying, fund- raising and advocating on behalf of gay issues,\" the report concluded.62 Funds Go Out, But Results Unknown (see page 41): Despite spending billions of dollars, the CD C HIV/AIDS prevention programs have been rated as \"not performing\" and having not dem onstrated results, according to the Office of Management and Budget's (OMB) program assessment.63 This rating indicates that a program has not been able to develop goals or collect data to determine whether it is working. 64 The OMB report noted that CDC's HIV/AIDS program \"does not have incentives and procedures to make gains mo re broadly or ways of measuring annual improvements.\" 1 \"AIDS Funding for Federal Government Programs: FY 1981-FY2008,\" Congressional Research Service (CRS), updated March 8, 2007.

But Are Funded Anyway CDC's HIV/AIDS prevention grants were found to have \"widespread defici encies\" during fiscal years 1999 through 2003 \u2014 during which time more than $2.6 billion was awarded by CDC for state and local HIV/AIDS grants. These findi ngs, contained in a September 2005 HHS Inspector General (IG) report, show a pa ttern of mismanagem ent, a lack of oversight, and in one documented example, a willingness of a CDC em ployee to make up grantee accomplishments simply to keep his projects running.1 This IG report shows a dist urbing trend that for years and years, once grantees were in the HIV/AIDS gr ant system, they had access to a never-ending pool of taxpayer dollars, regardle ss of their performance. NO OBJECTIVES NEEDED TO WIN SOME CDC HIV/AIDS GRANTS : According to the IG report, \"Awards for 14 of th e 15 grants [reviewed] lacked clear, specific objectives providing a basis for as sessing grantees' accomplishments , and, in fact, 2 of those 14 grants contained no objectives at all. \"...The objective of one grant, for example, was to evaluate the effectivene ss of other grants and to 'provide evaluation resources' to assist other grantees in measuring their own effectiveness. However, the grantee could not develop an ev aluation protocol acceptable to CDC during the 3- year grant period and was unable to perform an intended study, even though it expended all grant funds. A grantee official stated that the organizati on never understood what CDC wanted it to do.\" N O ACCOMPLISHMENTS NEEDED TO WIN ADDITIONAL FUNDS : Of the 15 grants audited by the IG, the CDC awarded continuation grants to 13 organizations, even though they had reported few or no accomplishments or had failed to submit required accomplishment reports. \"CDC awarded continuation grants to all of th e 13 organizations with multiyear projects even though the grantees had reported little in the wa y of actual accomplishments or had failed to report their accomplishments on a timely basis,\" the IG found. In some instances, the IG's office observed, and CDC project officers confirmed, that \"awards were based on the available funding levels rather than on a realistic dete rmination of the amount actually needed to carry out spec ific functions. When an existi ng grantee failed to reapply for continuation funds, for example, the previously earmarked funds were simply reallocated among the remaining grantees regardless of specific needs \" (emphasis added). One project officer \"termed a gr antee's performance 'abysmal' bu t told us that he had been instructed not to restrict funding on any grants,\" according to the IG report. 39NO BACKGROUND CHECK PERFORMED FOR CDC GRANTEES : Despite regulations requiring aud its, the IG noted, \"Files for 11 of the 15 grants did not contain an audit report for any of the 5 years in our audit period, or any eviden ce that the reports had been obtained, and none of the file s contained audit reports for ever y year. Further, 14 of the 15 grant files had no evidence that CDC personnel ha d queried databases that catalogued previous grant awards to identify grantees that had been debarred or placed on special restrictions because of significant operational problems. The 15th file indicated that CDC staff checked the databases for 1 of the 5 years but contained no ev idence that they analyzed the data. \"If CDC personnel had reviewed A-133 audit reports ... they would have noted that 8 of the 15 grantees were in weak financial positions or had significant manage ment and/or operating deficiencies.\"2 CDC CITES SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS BUT RENEWS GRANTS ANYWAY : The IG report notes, \"The gran t files showed that technical reviewers had not ed significant deficiencies in 10 of the 13 or ganizations applying for contin uation grants, but CDC did not require corrective action as a condi tion of the awards. The files contained no evidence that CDC personnel asked 5 of the 10 grantees to provide additional information in response to the noted deficiencies. Further, although grant files contained no evidence of any response from four of the five organizations that ha d been requested to provide ad ditional information, CDC took no additional action.\" ACCOMPLISHMENTS DOCTORED BY CDC STAFF : One project manager interviewed by the IG's auditors was found to have \"consiste ntly overstated grantees' accomplishments\" and \"acknowledged that he had done so because he had no choice but to characterize his grantees' accomplishments as at least acceptable to keep his project going.\" In another example, a project office told the auditors \"that he belie ved he had to prepare technical reports praising gran tees to maintain their funding and acknow ledged that he had prepared inaccurate and unsupported reports.\" D ESPITE $74 MILLION SPENT ON ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS , CDC CLAIMS LACK OF RESOURCES TO MONITOR GRANTS : The CDC, in response to the IG 's report cited above, admitted \"an overarching need to better monitor grants and to better comp ly with grant administration requirements ... At the same time, CDC recognizes that competing prio rities and restricted resources hamper the ongoing ability to better document all aspects of grant administration.\"3 The year CDC cited restricted resources as a r eason it was hampered in watching over grantees, it is estimated the HIV/AIDS prevention ad ministration and management budget was $74 million, or 9.4 percent of CDC's HIV/AIDS domestic budget. 4 40NEVER TOO LATE TO START MONITORING PERFORMANCE : In the summer of 2001, President George W. Bush 's Administration launched the President's Management Agenda, which requires agencies to work to improve government performance. In response to this, and a full twen ty years after the fe deral government started funding HIV/AIDS programs, \"CDC began in 2002 to identify high-quality outco me measures to more accurately monitor the performance of programs. CDC began including performance measures into all new grants and cooperative agreements as a term a nd condition of the award ... In addition, grantees are now required to address progress toward ach ieving the measurable outcomes of the performance goals ... and discuss measures of effectiveness in progress reports\" (emphasis added).5 1 All references in this section are from this Inspector General (IG) Report (unless otherwise noted): \"Management of HIV/AIDS Prevention Grants by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,\" HHS IG, September 2005, A- 04-03-08011, http://www.oig.hhs.gov /oas/reports/reg ion4/40308011.pdf . 2 OMB Circular A-133 contains information on Audits of States, Local Governments, and Non-Profit Organizations. 3 Letter to Deputy Inspector General for Audit Services from CDC's Chief Operating Officer, dated May 12, 2005, as contained in Appendix to IG report, http:/ /www.oig.hhs.gov/oas/reports/region4/40308011.pdf . 4 \"AIDS Funding for Federal Government CRS, updated April 18, 2006, http://www.congress.gov/ erp/rl/pdf/RL30731.pdf . 5 Footnote 3, op. cit. 41CDC's Domestic HIV/AIDS Program: Results Not Demonstrated Despite spending billions of dollars over th e past decade, the CDC HIV/AIDS programs \u2014 intended to prevent HIV infection and reduce the incidence of HIV-related illness through research, surveillance and grants for HIV/AIDS pr evention activities \u2014 have been rated as \"not performing\" and having not demonstrated results , according to the Office of Management and Budget's (OMB) program assessment.1 An OMB rating of \"Results Not Demonstrated\" i ndicates that a program has not been able to develop acceptable performance goals or collect data to determine whether it is performing. 2 The OMB review reported that initially the domestic HIV/AIDS program \"made progress on reducing new infections from 120,000 in the la te 1980's to 40,000 in the mid-1990's, but this level has not changed for several years. ...The pr ogram has taken steps to improve the efficiency of Federal operations, but does not have incentives and procedures to make gains more broadly or ways of measuring annual improvements \" (emphasis added).3 CDC TRACKS THE MONEY , JUST NOT THE RESULTS OR COST EFFECTIVENESS The following are the results of the OMB a ssessment of CDC's HI V prevention program4: Budget Review Question: Is the program budget aligned with the program goals in such a way that the impact of funding, policy, and legislative changes on performance is readily known? Answer: No. CDC's budget is currently aligned fo r financial accounting purposes, not for measuring performance. Budget Review Question: Does the program demonstrate improved efficien cies and cost effectiveness in achieving program goals each year? Answer: No. There are no measures of efficiency nor cost-effectiveness for this program. CDC's new initiative, \"Advancing HIV Prevention: St rategies for a Changing Epidemic,\" has the potential to improve agency effici ency in meeting the program goals. Taxpayers have a right to expect that an agency spending billions on preventing diseases should in fact be tracking whether or not those diseases are being prev ented, should be demanding results and efficiency from its grantees, and should be eliminating non-performing grantees from future eligibility for grants. While CDC currently is tr ying to reformulate its pr ocess in light of OMB's failing assessment, the fact that there was not a system in place for monitoring performance \u2014 after more than two decades and billions of do llars in HIV/AIDS spending \u2014 is unconscionable. 1 OMB Program Assessment, Domestic HIV/AIDS Prevention, http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/expect more/summary.10000254.2005.html , http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/expect more/detail.10000254.2005.html 1, op. cit. 4 Ibid. 42CDC-Funded Events Feature Porn Stars & Prostitute Tips, Transgender Beauty Contes ts, and Flirting Classes HIV is a deadly, communicable disease, with kn own transmission methods and identifiable high- risk populations. Yet, since 1995, CDC reports that every year an estimated 40,000 Americans are infected with HIV. Taxpayers may ques tion whether or not CDC's decision to award prevention grants to certain groups may in fact be to blame for some of these new in fections that could have \u2014 and should have \u2014 been prevented. Instead of focusing efforts on partner-notifica tion, risk avoidance, ear ly diagnosis through routine testing, and other proven epidemiological approaches for preventing the spread of communicable diseases, all too often many of CDC' s largest grantees were hosting events that produced questionable, if any, results and in some cases promoted activities in direct contradiction with known risk-behav iors for spreading the disease. One of CDC's largest HIV/AIDS grantees was ci ted for actually using CDC prevention funds to encourage sexual behavior. CDC guidelines for AIDS assistance programs direct that no funds are to \"be used to provide education or informa tion designed to promote or encourage, directly, homosexual or heterosexual sexual activ ity or intravenous substance abuse.\" 1 They further note that this shall \"not be construed to restrict the ability of an ed ucation program to provide accurate information about ... [AIDS], provided that any in formational materials used are not obscene.\"2 After years of congressional inqu iry, CDC finally sent a warn ing letter to the offending group whose activities were enc ouraging sexual behavior. RELATIONS WITH MALE PROSTITUTES : On April 10, 2003, the CDC-funded Stop AIDS Projec t of San Francisco, California hosted an event regarding \"Men for Hire.\" The featured speaker was Joseph Itiel, who, it was advertised, \"presents practical tips and cove rs the seven guidelines for safe and friendly relations with escorts.\"3 Mr. Itiel had authored a number of books, including A Consumer's Guide to Male Hustlers (which purports to \"acquaint readers who have a vigorous sexual appetite with a resource\") and Sex Workers As Virtual Boyfriends. Shortly after the event, he released Escort Tales: The Trophy Boy and Other Stories.4 Mr. Itiel told one newspaper that his workshop wa s an appropriate preven tion tool. \"Stop AIDS gives options to people where safe sex is discus sed and I did discuss sa fe sex at length. ...My subject was singled out because the powers that be don't view prostitution in a positive light.\" According to the Bay Area Reporter , Mr. Itiel argues sleeping with a sex worker is a way to engage in safe sex, \"If you pick up a sex worker , you have complete control of the situation. ... If you go to a sex club, you can have sex with say 10 people who had sex with another 10 people. If you go to a sex work er, you couldn't afford to see someone 10 times a day. Plus, he has less sex and is exposed to fewer diseases, logically.\" 5 43 FLIRTING 101: On February 10, 2004, the CDC-funded Stop AIDS Project of San Franci sco hosted a two-hour workshop that was advertised as in structing participants how \"to f lirt with greater finesse.\" The event was entitled \"Got Love? #2 - Flirt / Date / Score.\"6 ZOO TRIPS FOR HIV POSITIVE PEOPLE : In April 2002, the CDC-funded Stop AIDS Project of San Francisco hosted a zoo trip as part of its HIV prevention program for those who are alr eady infected with HIV. According to the CDC, zoo trips and other social outings are impor tant to prevention effort s because it helps to create a \"social network\" or \"peer group\" to \"influence positive behaviors,\" which described as reinforcing a nd promoting \"safe sex norms.\"7 The CDC reported a total of 27 people participated in the zoo trip. The costs included trans portation and staff time and the passes were provided by the zoo. E ROTIC WRITING CLASSES : In April 2003, the CDC-funded Stop AIDS Project of San Francisco hosted a four-part \"erotic writing workshop\" where participants were to \"S tart by exploring your fa ntasies and get support for you [ sic] creative writing process.\"8 AUDIT FINDS GROUP 'S ACTIVITIES ENCOURAGE SEXUAL ACTIVITY AND ARE OBSCENE ... YET CDC CONTINUED TO FUND GROUP : In response to congressional inquir y, it was reported that in 2000, the Stop AIDS Project of San Francisco received $698,000 in federal funds, in cluding CDC HIV prevention grants and that these funds were used to f und the activities listed above.9 In 2001, HHS's Inspector General (IG) noted th at two other CDC-funded STOP AIDS Project HIV prevention workshops, entitled \"Booty Call\" and \"Great Sex,\" violati on of CDC's guidance ... and as 'obscene,' and thus not in compliance with CDC guidance.\" 10 Despite the IG's 2001 findings, the CDC-funded or ganization advertised the next year for another \"Booty Call\" workshop, which again provoke d congressional inquiries, and subsequently was cancelled on the day of the event. The or ganization said the even t was cancelled for low turnout. 11 The IG followed up with the STOP AIDS Project and, according to a 2003 letter to the House Subcommittee on Criminal Justice, Drug Policy and Human Resources, the CDC claimed that \"the design and delivery of STOP AIDS preven tion activities was based on current accepted behavioral science theories in the areas of health promotion.\" 12 44CDC AUDITOR WOULD INVITE MOM TO GRAPHIC WORKSHOPS : One CDC auditor who was in California to revi ew the STOP AIDS workshops, such as \"Booty Call\" and \"Men for Hire,\" is reported to have told another CDC employee, \"I would take my mother to this.\"13 CDC WARNS GROUP , YET FEDERAL FUNDS STILL FLOW : Despite some CDC employees' comfort with th e federally funded workshops, in June of 2003, CDC Director Dr. Julie Gerberdi ng wrote to San Francisco-based STOP AIDS Project that some of the group's HIV prevention workshops violat e the ban on encouraging sexual activity and asked the group to discontinue the workshops. 14 According to news reports, she threatened to revoke as much as $500,000 in federal grants if the group failed to comply.15 STOP AIDS Project's spokesperson told one newspaper that she was \"shocked\" by the CDC letter and the director of the Sa n Francisco health department said that he supports the workshops and would use city funds to supplement the St op AIDS Project budget if the group lost federal funds. \"We in San Francisco believe that to re ach the men who have sex with men who are at highest risk of HIV transmission, we need to speak the same language they do, and we need to have workshops that draw them in.\" 16 One local AIDS activist questioned this rationale. \"Stop AIDS Project clai ms that they can only reach at risk gay men by putting on provocative programs like Booty Call,\" said AIDS activist Michael Petrelis of San Francisco. \"By their ow n admission, this program has a low turn out as those they are trying to reach have either been turned off or tuned out their provocative workshops. And while Stop AIDS Project is wa sting and misusing federal HIV resources, the City's HIV rate is soaring to the highest levels in 20 years, according to the SF [San Francisco] health department.\" 17 Another AIDS activist seems to imply that no amount of government ove rsight is reasonable when it comes to CDC prevention funding: \"The message you send not just to STOP AIDS Project, but to thousands of grass-roots preven tion groups across the coun try, is that a group of right-wing jihadists with political power will be looking over their shoulders as they attempt to meet the prevention needs of their communities, \" Terje Anderson, executive director of the National Association of People with AIDS, wr ote to CDC Director Julie L. Gerberding. 18 At the time of his \"jihadists\" comment, Anderson's gr oup, the National Associ ation of People with AIDS, was the recipient of $1.4 million in federal grant funds (much of it likely from CDC), and it continued to receive over $1.3 million a year for the next two fiscal years.19 PORN STARS HEADLINE CDC-F UNDED SAFE-SEX EVENT : In July 2002, a CDC-funded group in Missouri called Blacks Assisting Blacks Against AIDS (BABAA) hired Memphis gay porn star Edgar Ga ines, whose movie name is Bobby Blake, to attend a \"safe-sex\" event at the BABAA's Executiv e Director's downtown loft. Gains was paid $500 from a syphilis elimination grant.20 The porn star appeared at the event in a towel and cowboy boots.21 After an investigation, the money was subsequently reimbursed to the CDC and 45the group fired the two people in charge. \"We felt th at even with [Gaines] being at the event with just a towel and boots on was totally inappropriate and some thing we don't condone,\" said Donnell Smith, a lawyer and vice chairman of the group's board.22 The event also prompted the St. Louis Health Department to cancel the remaining $6,000 of its $96,000 syphilis prevention grant to Blacks Assisting Blacks Against AIDS, according to a news report. The grant reportedly was the smaller of two grants BABAA received through the city from the CDC. In 2002, it was reported that BABAA received a total of approximately $1.6 million in government assistance.23 According to one news report, the St. Louis C ity auditors' report noted the AIDS group bought $14,487 in equipment without following federal biddi ng rules and billed one of its grants $3,642 more for salaries than it actually paid employ ees. The chairman of BABAA's board told a newspaper the group hoped to win back the syphilis grant and would continue serving AIDS patients. 24 CDC-F UNDED DRAG CONTEST : 25 On May 12, 2001, the Mr./Ms. UTOPIA pageant entitle d \"Jewel of the Pacific\" was held at the Southeast Community College Auditorium. U.T.O. P.I.A is The United Territories of Polynesian Islanders' Alliance, a 501(c)(3) located in Sa n Francisco, California. The organization was formed \"to provide support to the Polynesi an Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, and Transgender community.\"26 A flyer for the event notes \"funding by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\" and \"Partial fundi ng by Centers for Disease Contro l and Prevention through Asian & Pacific Islander Wellness Center.\" Accordi ng to a person answering the phone number listed on the flyer, the event was primarily a transgen dered contest, although anyone was welcome to enter.27 HIV testing was advertised as be ing available on-site at the event. The Asian & Pacific Islander Wellness Center, the group noted in the flyer as passing CDC funding through to the pageant, has a mission \"t o educate, support, empower and advocate for Asian and Pacific Islander [A&PI] communities \u2014 pa rticularly A&PIs living with, or at-risk for, HIV/AIDS.\" In 2001, the Center's revenue was almost $3 million. In 2003, according to its website, its revenue was a little less than in 2001, but still near $3 million. While federal funding figures are unavailable for 2001, the group reports the federal government provided 38 percent of their 2003 budget, which would equal approxim ately a million dollars. In 2005, the federal government's portion grew to 49 percent of its $3.366 million budget, or over $1.6 million.28 46According to CDC data, Asian-Americans have one of the lowest HIV and AIDS rates in the United States. \"At the end of 2004, an estimate d 212,572 persons were known to be living with HIV (not AIDS) in the 35 areas with confid ential name-based HIV infection reporting since 2000: 49% were black, 34% white, 15% Hispanic, and 1% each were American Indian/Alaska Native and Asian/Pacific Islander . At the end of 2004, approxi mately 415,193 persons in the United States were living with AIDS: 43% were black, 35% white , 1% each were American Indian/Alaska Native and Asian/Pacific Islander \" (emphasis added). 29 Despite receiving millions of dollars from the federal government in the past few years, according to the Asian & Pacific Islander Wellne ss Center's website, in the last 17 years the organization only has \"served over 600 HIV-positive A&PIs.\" 30 1 \"Interim Revision of Requirements for Content of AI DS-Related Written Materials, Pictorials, Audiovisuals, Questionnaires, Survey Instruments, and Educational Sessions Used in Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Assistance Programs,\" Federal Register , June 15, 1992. 2 Ibid. 3 Stop AIDS website, http://www.stopaids.org/ ; http://www.stopaids.org/mod.php?mod= calendar&op=show_event&event_id=391 April 2003. 4 nb_ss_gw/104-2691215-9413507?url=search- alias%3Dstripbooks&field-keywords=Joseph+Itiel+&Go.x=12&Go.y=11&Go=Go , accessed October 2006. 5 \"Stop AIDS on defensive again,\" Bay Area Reporter , June 19, 2003. 6 STOP AIDS website, http://www.st opaids.org/programs/events/index.html , accessed February 2004. 7According to CDC officials on a conf erence call with the House Governme nt Reform Committee in response to congressional inquiries, April 19, 2002. 8 STOP AIDS website, http://www.stopaids.org/ , accessed April 2003. 9 \"Federal Funding of San Francisco Stop AIDS Project,\" Memorandum from HHS Inspector General Janet Rehnquist to Secretary Tommy Thompson, October 12, 2001.

Even conference participants acknowledg e that their colleagues travel from conference to conference essentially talking to each other and fighti ng each other over the pot of federal funding.2 It seems little time is spent reflecting on wh at could be done on the ground to actually fight HIV, for example, if taxpayer funds were not spent on transcontin ental flights, hotel a ccommodations, and large registration fees to attend conference after conference. In response to congressional inquiry, HHS reported that from FY2000 through FY2005, the CDC spent $44.7 million on conferences. 3 Taxpayers have a right to ask if the CDC spending $45 million on conferences in just six years al one was the best use of taxpayer funds. The following is just a sample of so me of the conferences CDC funded: Y OUTH CONFERENCE FEATURING ABORTION GROUPS , MTV, AND LOBBYING : The CDC was listed as a plati num sponsor for a June 1-4, 2004, Global Health Council youth conference in Washington, D.C., that was to feature International Planned Parenthood (IPPF), the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), M oveOn.org, and MTV, as well as an \"advocacy day\" on Capitol Hill.4 The event entitled \"Youth and Health: Generation on the Edge\" featured the head of the UNFPA as a keynote speaker. UNFPA lost U.S. federa l funding for violating U.S. law through its support of and involvement in Ch ina's coercive one-child policy. 5 In one undercover investigation, a UNFPA representa tive in China was found to shar e an office with the Chinese official responsible for enforcing the one-child policy \u2014 an official who carried out his work through coercive and forced abortion and sterilization.6 UNFPA has been unapologetic about its work in China and it started a grassroots effort in response to the loss of U.S. funding. The CDC-funded youth conference was not only honoring th e UNFPA head with a spot as a featured speaker, but it actually scheduled a conference session so the UNFPA could share how it was mobilizing its supporters to donate more money in response to the loss of U.S. federal funds. The CDC-sponsored conference also featured an IPPF speaker who helped develop a \"youth manifesto\" with a goal that \"society must r ecognise the righ t of all young people to enjoy sex and to express their sexuality in the way that they choose\" a nd that \"sexual and reproductive health services for young peopl e must be confidential.\"7 This terminology is frequently used by IPPF and others in the industry to oppose pa rental notice and consent efforts regarding contraception and abortion for minors. IPPF is one of the largest abortion-performing organizations in the world, and its director-gen eral was quoted as sayi ng abortion is a \"human right\" that her group would not sign away.8 49After congressional backlash, HHS, CDC, a nd USAID pulled their collective $365,000 in financial support for the conference, which accord ing to HHS spokesman Bill Pierce was due to a law prohibiting federal dollars to be spent on lobbying. He said the group's pl ans to hold an \"advocacy day\" on Capitol Hill would have violated that law.9 DRUG LEGALIZATION CONFERENCE : HHS and CDC sponsored an August 19-20, 200 5, Utah conference hosted by the Harm Reduction Project and the Harm Reduction Coa lition \u2014 organizations that support tacit legalization of drugs, including methamphetamine. Several sessions planned for the conference appear to promote illegal drug use and risky sexu al behavior such as, \"We Don't Need a 'War' on Methamphetamine,\" and \"You Don't Have to Be Clean & Sober. Or Even Want to Be!\"10 The CDC sent six employees to the conferen ce and $13,500 in CDC funds were used to support the conference. 11 According to the CDC Director, prope r protocols were not followed regarding the CDC grantee getting the re quired CDC approval for e xpenditure of federal funds.12 According to a press release, the Deputy Genera l Counsel of the Oklaho ma State Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs C ontrol canceled his par ticipation in the conference when he learned about its \"disturbing content [and t] he Oklahoma State Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs Control conve yed to Dr. Coburn's office th eir frustration about being misinformed by conference organizers.\" 13 One of the presenters had earlier been quoted as sa ying, \"For a lot of people, meth use is a rite of passage and it really does increase sexual pleasure.\" He also criticized current so-called safer sex messages promoting condom use every time as no longer effective and instead encouraged \"harm reduction techniques\" dur ing risky sexual behavior. 14 MILLIONS SPENT ON AIDS CONFERENCES : Atlanta 2001: In the spring of 2001, the CDC's HIV/ AIDS prevention director notified community-based HIV/AIDS organizations that they could use federal funds to attend an upcoming conference entitled \"Cap acity building for HIV Prevention\" in Atlanta, Georgia. Specifically CDC noted, \"Your c ooperative agreement funds may be used to support travel, lodging, per diem expenses, and re gistration fees for your attendan ce at this meeting\" which was to help enhance their skills in the areas of organizational and infrastructure development; intervention design, implementation and ev aluation, community mobilization, and HIV prevention community planning participation. One of the skills for thes e grantees: learning to dance. The preliminary agenda for Wednesday, April 4, 2001, included instruction on the skills of \"Cultural Dance \u2014 Latin Dan ce\" with a \"Disco to follow.\" Hundreds of CDC employees travel to talk: In response to congressional inquiry, CDC re ported the following number of CDC employees attending international AIDS conferences:15 1992/Amsterdam: 43 1993/Berlin: 50 50 1994/Yokohama, 2000/Durban: 68 2002/Barcelona: 90 2004/Thailand: 20 2006/Toronto: 78 HHS employees (includes CDC employees) 16 Barcelona conference attendee protests U.S. treatment of people with AIDS Barcelona 2002: The 14th International Conference on AIDS he ld in Barcelona, Spain, in July 2002 hosted 236 HHS attendees, including 90 CDC atte ndees, and cost taxpayers $3.6 million in federal funds. In response to congressional inquiry, HHS reporte d travel costs made up over $1 million of the total cost to taxpayers.17 The CDC alone, it was reported, spent $908,866 on travel to this conference.18 HHS Secretary Tommy Thompson flew to Barcelona to deliver an address on HIV/AIDS on behalf of the U.S. (which give s more money to fight the disease than any nation in the world), but was \"shouted down\" by protestors and was unable to be heard. Despite the fact that 26 percent of all AIDS treatme nt centers in the world are Catholic facilities, and that the Catholic Church looks after one-in-every-four AIDS pa tients, the conference held in Barcelona, Spain, excluded the Vatican. 19 CDC Trip Funds Could Have Spared More Than 113,000 Newborns from HIV If the funds CDC spent on travel to send 90 employees to Barcelona to talk about HIV/AIDS instead had been spent on Nevira pine (a retroviral drug that costs less than $4 a dose and has proven to prevent HIV transmission from mother to child with the administration of just two doses), more than 113,000 infants around the world could have been treated and spared from HIV infection . 51UNAIDS estimates that 1,800 children worldwide b ecome infected with HIV each day, the vast majority of whom are newborns.20 UNAIDS estimates that in 2005, ju st less than 8 percent of pregnant women in low- and middle-income countr ies had access to services that could prevent the transmission of HIV to their babies.21 New Orleans 2003: On September 18-21, 2003, the CDC- funded National Minority AIDS Council (NMAC) sponsored a 2,800-person AIDS conference in New Orleans featuring an entertainer who, in a skit described by attending AIDS activists as \"extremely graphic,\" boasted that she had sexual relations with Vice President Dick Cheney. Carole Bernard, director of communications for NMAC, said the song was well-re ceived, \"the feedback that we have gotten is that they loved her son g. People cheered and applauded.\"22 According to news reports, the conference received at l east $300,000 in funding from several HHS agencies (including CDC and the Health Re sources and Services Ad ministration (HRSA)), while the U.S. Agency for International Deve lopment (USAID) and the U.S. Department for Housing and Urban Development (HUD) also were listed on the conference program as \"government partners.\" The conference also fe atured a workshop entitle d \"Abstinence-Based vs. Comprehensive Sexuality Education,\" where a pres enter \"provided a bluepr int to get abstinence education defunded and out of sc hools,\" according to one attendee. 23 A separate workshop presenter argued that abstinence education is politically motivated and \"harmful\" to children.24 In 2003, NMAC received $4.7 million a year in federal funds. 25 Thailand 2004: The 15 th International AIDS Conference in Bangkok, Thailand, drew more than 17,000 delegates and according to one report, \"Science took a back seat to the concurrent sessions on social, economic, lega l, policy making and other aspect s of AIDS. Three elephants depicted on the conference logo became an unint entional symbol of the boisterous political circuses that AIDS conferences have become.\"26 Another report said, \"What began in 1985 as an annual gathering of scientists, aimed at shari ng laboratory findings and information from the battlefronts in the war on H.I.V., has been tr ansformed into a meeting of 17,000 consultants, bureaucrats and activists fighting one another for money to build a huge global AIDS treatment program, employing tens of thousands of people.\"27 The event also featured, \"Brazilian dresses made of condoms [and] a drag show from Indonesia ... [along with] dozens of other cultural performan ces, art shows, fashion parades and films from around the world [that] will be featured at the international AIDS conference this month in Bangkok to break the monotony of scientific se ssions,\" according to event organizers.28 In response to congressional inquiry, federal agencies reported that more than 130 federal employees, including 20 CDC employees, attended the event. This number does not include employees stationed in Asia.29 The CDC originally, and in violation of HHS restrictions, planned to send 48 employees.30 The registration fee was between $800 and $1,250 per person, which amounted to between $16,000 to $25,000 in registration fees alone for non-Asia-based CDC employees, not counting travel expenses and hotel costs. 31 If the originally planne d 48 CDC employees had attended, registration costs would have totaled between $38,400 and $60,000. 52The U.S. Ambassador on AIDS said of the Thaila nd conference, \"You really need to say was the value that was generated by this kind of a confer ence worth that kind of money or could part of that money be spent more efficiently in some other directions in or der to fight HIV/AIDS. ...There is a kind of an industry that's develope d of people who spend their time talking to each other ... I think we need to eval uate ... that the value that is generated by the cost of bringing them here, is something that's justified as oppos ed to putting that money in other parts of our HIV efforts.\"32 One report said, \"The sound bites from last w eek's AIDS conference in Bangkok were straight out of a Michael Moore movie.\" 33 AIDS activists denounced the Bush Administration and abstinence-until-marriage educati on. \"The United States contribut es more money for AIDS than any other country. Yet participants in Bangkok s till harshly criticized the Bush administration for doing too little, emphasizing a policy of abstinence and severely restricting the number of government scientists allowed to attend the conference.\"34 Philadelphia 2004: In March 2004, a CDC-sponsored STD Prevention Conference in Philadelphia included a 200-person, anti-abstinen ce education protest organized by, among other groups, Housing Works, a New York-based grou p that received more than $1.9 million in funding from the Department HUD in 1999 and 2000. 35 The same week the protesting grantees gathered, the House Government Reform Co mmittee voted to reduce the CDC's event and conference funding by $7 million calling the events \"luxuries\" and saying past conferences have been \"noted for ... political, rath er than public health content.\"36 A CDC spokesman said, \"The protest ... took place outside of the venue and it occurred after the session had ended,\" adding that the conference provided a forum for scientists to share \"new information about advances in STD prevention.\"37 CDC Trip Funds Could Have Spared Th ousands of Newborns from HIV Just using the CDC employees' Thai land conference registration fees, between 2,000 to 3,125 infants around th e world could have been treated with two doses of Nevirapine (a retrovi ral drug that costs less than $4 a dose and has proven to prevent HIV transmi ssion from mother to child with the administration of just two doses) and spared from HIV infection. 53Toronto 2006: Laxmi Narayan Tripathi, a transvestite from India, looks at a dress made of condoms by Brazilian artis t Adriana Bertini, along with another condom dress by the same artist, on exhibit at the International AIDS conference in Toronto38 \"T-shirts, condoms, grant proposals and 20,000 peopl e. It must be the International Aids Conference in Toronto ... the biennial jamboree for what now constitutes an 'Aids industry' engaging everything from big pharma to 'anthrop ologists for sex workers' rights' groups. Nearly every participant makes a living in this industry.\"39 The 16 th Annual International AIDS conference held August 13-18, 2006 in Toronto, Canada, included 26,000 participants from 170 count ries, approximately 3,000 of whom were journalists.40 One report estimated conferees were spending at least $13 million on the conference, assuming $500 per participant.41 In response to congressional inquiry, HHS reported it planned to spend $315,000 on the International AIDS Conference in Toronto, Ca nada, as well as send 78 federal employees. 42 The costs included $170,000 for hotel and per diem s, $45,000 for registrations, $65,000 for airfares, $15,000 for a share of a booth, and $20,000 for a satellite HRSA mee ting regarding the President's emergency plan for AIDS relief (PEPFAR).43 The conference included presentations from re searchers who said countries must recognize prostitution as \"legitimate legal work,\" in both criminal law and labor codes, to fight HIV and other diseases among \"sex work ers\" and the broader population. 44 One convention center exhibit, sponsored by Stella, the Montreal \"sex wo rkers\" alliance, featured three prostitutes lying on a satin-covered bed, which was designed to \"l ook like a typical workplace.\" According to a Stella representative, at least 24 prostitutes from 21 countries, whom she referred to as \"sex workers,\" were on scholarship to attend the Toledo conference.45 One prostitute from Thailand was described as \"standing amid pillows and sex toys in the [conference's Stilleto] Lounge. To cheers from a crowd of around 200 people, she de manded health insurance, paid vacation and job security.\" 46 The conference also featured a workshop on findi ng a woman's erotic zone, one on how to apply condoms through \"sex stunts,\" and a display of exp licit artwork, all of whic h were described as \"hugely popular\" at the 16 th International AIDS Conference.47 Also featured was clothing made 54from condoms, by artist Adriana Bertini of Sao Paulo, Brazil, who has \"been making her condom fashions for 10 years.\"48 Reports indicated that the Bu sh Administration, which has f unded the world's largest donor program for HIV/AIDS, repeat edly came \"under attack\" for focusing on abstinence and monogamous relationships over cond om distribution in the preventi on of HIV/AIDS and also for refusing to fund needle-exchange programs fo r drug addicts or any activities \"promoting prostitution.\" 49 (The U.S. focus on these areas and the restrictions on funds were enacted into law by the United States Congress by overwhelming majorities in both the House and the Senate. The law does not prohibit the federal government or its grantees from provid ing health assistance to prostitutes.50) According to the U.S. Global AIDS Coor dinator, the U.S. planned to distribute 477 million condoms in 2006, up from 320 million in 2001.51 Stephen Lewis, the UN Secretary General's Specia l Envoy for HIV/AIDS in Africa, said in his closing session keynote speech, \"What has to happ en, I think, is that we place a temporary moratorium on the endless, self-indulgent pro liferation of meetings, seminars, roundtables, discussion groups, task forces ad nauseam, plus the production of reports, documents, monographs, statistical data ad repetition, and concentrate ev ery energy at country level.\" 52 Federal Trip Funds Could Have Spared Almost 40,000 Newborns from HIV If the funds HHS spent sending 78 employees to Toronto to talk about HIV/AIDS had been spent on Nevirapine (a retroviral drug that costs less than $4 a dose and has proven to prevent HIV transmission from mother to child with the administration of just two doses), more than 39,000 infants around the world could have been treated and spared from HIV infection . If the 26,000 Toronto conference attendees, who it was estimated spent $13 million to attend, had instead pooled their resources for retroviral drugs, they could have treated 1.63 million infants. 55Hollywood, Florida 2006: Photo from NMAC registration form 53 More than 3,500 people involved in AIDS work gathered in Hollywood, Florida, in September 2006 for The U.S. Conference on AIDS (USCA), sponsored by the National Minority AIDS Council (NMAC).54 In response to congressional i nquiry, it was reported that 92 federal employees attended this conference, includi ng 67 from the CDC, and that over $410,000 in federal funds were spent on the conference.55 Conference registration ranged from $360 to $595 per person. 56 Thus, conference registration alone for CDC employees was between $33,120 to $54,740, not including transportation and lodging. According to one news re port, federal HHS funds paid fo r \"scholarships\" that enabled \"at least 950\" people to attend the conference, which may have cost $342,000 in registrations alone. 57 Activists attending the conferen ce said President Bush and Congress have cut money for education campaigns that teach youth and adults how to prevent the AIDS virus through safe sex and abstinence and are not increasing funds to treat additional cases of HIV that the widespread testing will find. NMAC's government relati ons director asked, \"Where's the money?\" 58 In fiscal year 2006, the federal government sp ent $21.05 billion in 2006 on HIV/AIDS, including $13.8 billion on treatment, and $2.2 billion on prevention. 59 Despite the federal government spending billions of federal HIV/AIDS funds (i ncluding grants to NMAC, one of the largest HIV/AIDS grant recipients), there are a reported 40,000 new cases of HIV each year.60 According to its 2005 IRS 990 filing, NMAC received $3.5 million in government funds, spent $1.5 million on conferences, and earned $435,695 milli on from conference registrations. The group paid its executive direct or $172,652 in salary and $8,633 in deferred compensation, and provided him with a $4,368 expense account. In 2005, NMAC spent $588,855 on consultants \u2014 down from the over $1 million it paid consultants in 2004. 61 The Hollywood, Florida conference included a se ssion on lobbying, a Latin Fiesta, featuring a \"sizzling fashion show,\" and a beach party that included a 15-foot high sand sculpture of the NMAC and USCA logo. 62 562006 STD CONFERENCE FEATURING THE DANGERS OF ABSTINENCE : The CDC scheduled a 2006 National STD Preven tion Conference with a panel entitled \"Are Abstinence-Only-Until-Marriage Programs a Threat to Public Health?\" The panel was to be made up of speakers who claim abstinence-until -marriage programs are not effective and are even dangerous. Among the announced panelists was the vice pres ident for public policy of the Sexuality Information and Education Council of the United States (SIECUS), a fe derally funded advocacy group that promotes contraception-based, sex- education programs and has spearheaded a campaign to stop federally funde d abstinence education programs. 63 The CDC scheduled the SIECUS panelist to speak about a report critical of abstinence cu rricula that was prepared by the partisan congressional staff on the House Government Reform Committee for Democrat Congressman Henry Waxman of California.64 Though the \"Waxman Report\" was released to the press, it was not a peer-reviewed scientific doc ument published in any scientific journal. Like SIECUS, Congressman Waxman, a long-time proponent of federally funded, contraceptive- based, (often graphic) sex-education programs, has repeatedly called for th e defunding of federal abstinence education programs. 65 This despite the fact that according to one report, in 2002 alone, the government spent $12 promoting contraception and condom use for every $1 it spent to encourage teens to abstain from sexual activity. 66 Another presenter was to focus on why states take federal abstinence funds and why some implement abstinence education instead of comp rehensive, contraception-based education to \"better understand the political pr ocess involved to modify thes e unfortunate circumstances.\" 67 Abstinence programs, the presenter was to argue , \"are not empirically s upported and have been tied to actually raising STD infection rates.\" Yet an April 2003 study published in Adolescent and Family Health found that increased abstinence accounted for 67 percent of the decline in pregnancy rate for teen girls ages 15 to 19, and 51 percent of the drop in the birth rate for si ngle teen girls was attributed to abstinence. A similar study releas ed in the August 2004 Journal of Adolescent Health attributes 53 percent of the decline in pregnancy rates for 15-17 year olds to decreased sexual activity, which was larger than the decline attributed to contraceptive use. 68 A study released in April 2007 of four of the 400 federally funded abstinence programs reported that \"Contrary to concerns raised by some critics of ... abstinence[-until -marriage] funding, however, pr ogram group youth were no more likely to have engaged in unprot ected sex than control group youth.\"69 The CDC's scheduled panel was in direct opposition to what the CDC's director called \"the first line of defense against HIV/AIDS.\" In he r 2002 speech accepting the appointment to the Director of the CDC, Dr. Julie Gerberding reminded those present that CDC's core identity is as an \"agency that promotes 'safer, healthier people' in all communities.\" She went on to define healthier people as including \"healthy youth - who are physically fit and abstain from smoking and sexual activity that poses a threat of HIV and STDs.\" Dr. Gerberding spoke of the successful HIV prevention program in Uganda and said, \"Abstinence and monogamy, along with the avoidance of risky behaviors, are th e first line of defens e against HIV/AIDS.\" 70 57 After a congressional inquiry from Congressman Mark Souder (R-IN) questioned the panel's balance, the CDC changed the panel to include two supporters of abstinence education programs, and cancelled the presentation on Congressman Waxman's report.71 In response to CDC actually balancing the panel with both proponents and opponents of fede ral abstinence-until-marriage programs, Congressman Waxman sent a letter to HHS Secretary Leavitt claiming, \"In effect, it appears that presentations at a public health c onference were censored because they criticized abstinence-only education. This attempt at thought control should have no place in our government.\"72 TAXPAYERS PAY FOR CONFERENCE TRIPS FOR GRANTEES IN ADDITION TO FEDERAL EMPLOYEES : It is not just the federal employ ees who use tax dollars to travel to conferences, but some of the grantees themselves use CDC grant funds to pay for their trips. A gr ant application from the Better World Advertising (BWA) company, wh ich received a $520,000, 12-month CDC contract for HIV prevention services, incl uded a provision that the grante e's \"Project Coordinator will attend at least one HIV Prevention re lated conference this funding cycle.\"73 The CDC continued to fund this group and pay fo r its conference travel, despite some of its previously controversial work. For exam ple, one CDC-funded BWA commercial, which included a shirtless transgender with breasts, was rejected for day-time airing by a local television station. BWA's owner evidently felt that the innocence of children was an unfair standard for buying air time. He told the Bay Area Reporter , \"What KGO [the local station] said is that children six or seven years old will se e it and ask their parents about it and they won't know what to say,\" said Les Pappas, president of Better World Advertis ing, which produced the ads and had offered the station $12,000 to air them during daytime TV . \"It's outrageous.\" 74 Two years later the group again came under fire for placing a cartoon penis and syphilis sores on bus shelters. The owner of the advertising space told the San Francisco Chronicle , \"Things like that come up, and we're sensitive to it, esp ecially when there are children around. ...We just asked them to tone down the graphics is all.\" Again BWA's Les Pappas pushed back, \"Since it's a public health thing, I thi nk it calls for people to be a little more enlightened.\" 75 CONCLUSION Whether or not it can be demonstrated that grantees benefit from attending federally funded conferences, one thing is clear: the conferen ce circuit appears to have taken on a life of its own, with grantees and federal employees travel ing from one conference to another on the taxpayers' dime. At some point , the CDC will need to decide whether or not spending $45 million over the last six year s on conferences is the best use of limited federal funds to prevent and c ontrol diseases.

Syphilis has been the focus of one such campaign costing hundreds of millions of tax dollars, and yet the rates of the disease are going up. In 1999, in a report calling for the elimination of syphilis, the CDC announced a national goal to \"to reduce [primary and secondary] P&S syphilis cases to 1,000 or fewer and to increase the number of syphilis-free counties to 90% by 2005.\" 1 Congress responded by nearly doubling the CDC's syphilis budget in 2001 to an amount that was three times the funds allocated to the disease just two years earlier. As the funding went up, unfortuna tely, so too did the reported cases of sexually transmitted syphilis. Fr om 1999 to 2004, the reported syphilis rates among men not only did not decrease but actually increa sed by 68 percent. CDC analysis suggests that 64 percent of all adult P&S syphilis cases in 2004 were among homosexual men, up from an estimated five percent in 1999. Syphilis rates also increased among African Americans in 2004, for the first time in more than a decade, in cluding significant increas es among black men (up 22.6 percent from 2003 to 2004).2 In 2005, CDC's own STD surveillance statistics reported: \"Syphilis: Cases Increase for Fifth Consecutive Year. The rate of primary and s econdary (P&S) syphilis \u2014 the most infectious stages of the disease \u2014 decreased throughout th e 1990s, and in 2000 reached an all-time low. However, over the past five years [from 2000-2005] , the syphilis rate in the United States has been increasing.\" 3 WHAT IS SYPHILIS ? Syphilis is a sexually transmitted disease caused by the bacteria Treponema pallidum . The disease usually can be cured with antibiotics. It is highly contagious during the primary and secondary stages: a single sexual encounter with a person who has syphilis results in infection about one third of the time. An infected pers on who does not get treatment may infect others during the first two stages when lesions (sores ) are present. The bacterium enters the body through mucous membranes, such as those in the vagina or mouth, or th rough the skin. Within hours, the bacterium reaches nearby lymph nodes, and then spreads throughout the body by way of the bloodstream. In its late stages, untre ated syphilis, although not contagious, can cause serious heart abnormalities, mental disorders, blin dness, other neurological problems and death. Syphilis also can infect an unborn child in th e womb, and can sometimes infect newborns, causing birth defects and other seri ous mental and physical problems. 4 This type of syphilis is known as congenital syphilis. Congenital syphi lis infections among infants are largely preventable if mothers receive appropriate diagno sis and treatment during prenatal care. Death of the unborn child or newborn infant occurs in up to 40 percent of pregnant women who have untreated syphilis.5 62In its early stages, this sexually transmitted di sease may produce open sores, making it easy for patients to spot and doctors to diagnose. Even asymptomatic infections are easily identified through testing, and the disease usually can be qu ickly and cheaply cured with just one dose of penicillin. Traditional approaches to STD c ontrol \u2014 patient education, easy access to testing and treatment, and door-to-door tracking of at-risk sexual part ners \u2014 reportedly are cost- effective ways to prevent and stop the spread of the disease. 6 CDC SPENDS $269 MILLION ON ELIMINATION EFFORT ... YET 58,116 NEW REPORTED million F IGURE 7. NEW CASES CLIMB DESPITE LARGE FUNDING INCREASES CDC Syphilis Funding vs. New of Reported Syphilis Cases Each Year Source: Center for Disease Control CasesFunding level CDC announces elimination campaign 63IF AT FIRST YOU DON'T SUCCEED , CHANGE THE GOAL'S DEADLINE ... TWICE : In 1999, the CDC first announced a national goal to \"to reduce P&S [primary and secondary] syphilis cases to 1,000 or fewer and to increase the number of syphilis-fr ee counties to 90% by 2005.\"8 In a 2004 program assessment, the CDC's long-te rm measures for STDs included \"eliminating syphilis by 2008\" (three years after the origin al elimination goal). 9 In May 2006, CDC announced a \"reframing\" of th e syphilis elimination effort. The agency named the effort, \"Together We Can: The nationa l plan to eliminate syphilis from the United States\" and declared that \"CDC's vision is to create a dynamic, evidence-based and culturally competent prevention and control action plan fo r the elimination of syphilis from the United States. By 2010 [five years later than the 1999 effort, and two years later than the 2004 assessment indicated], interim elimination targ ets will be to reduce rates of primary and secondary syphilis in the United States to less than 2.2 per 100,000 population; congenital syphilis to fewer than 3.9 per 100,000 live births; a nd Black:White racial disparities to a ratio of less than 3:1.\"10 ... OR CUT A FEW CASES BY NOT COUNTING U.S. TERRITORIES : Even though its prevention mission extends to prev enting diseases, such as syphilis, in U.S. territories, CDC frequently leaves out the U.S. te rritories of Guam, the Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico when reporting syphilis statistics to the press.11 While they are small territories with small populations, leaving these U.S. terr itories out of the syphilis case count results in hundreds of fewer new cases reported each year, thus some times making the picture rosier than it is. SYPHILIS ELIMINATION FUNDS USED TO HIRE GAY PORN STAR: During CDC's first campaign to eliminate syph ilis, one CDC grantee used federal syphilis elimination funds to hire a porn star. In July 2002, a CDC-funded group in Missouri called Blacks Assisting Blacks Against AIDS (BABAA ) hired Memphis gay porn star Edgar Gaines, whose movie name is Bobby Blake, to attend a \"saf e-sex\" event at the then executive director's downtown loft. He was paid $500 from a syphilis elimination grant.12 The porn star appeared at the event in a towel and cowboy boots. 13 After an investigation, the money was subsequently reimbursed to the CDC and the group fired the two people in charge (including the executive director). \"We felt that even with [Gaines] being at the event with just a towel and boots on was totally inappropriate and something we don't condone,\" said Donnell Smith, a lawyer and vice chairman of the group's board.14 The event also prompted the St. Louis Health Department to cancel the remaining $6,000 of its $96,000 syphilis prevention grant to Blacks Assisting Blacks Against AIDS, according to a news report. The grant reportedly was the smaller of two BABAA received through the city from the CDC. In 2002, it was reported that BABAA received a total of approximately $1.6 million in government assistance.15 64According to one news report, the St. Louis C ity auditors' report noted the AIDS group bought $14,487 in equipment without following federal biddi ng rules and billed one of its grants for $3,642 more in salary costs than it actually paid out to employ ees. The chairman of BABAA's board told a newspaper the group hoped to win back the syphilis grant and would continue serving AIDS patients. 16 HHS SECRETARY TELLS GRANTEES TO HIRE THEIR OWN STRIPPERS : After this event led to additional congressional inquiries and audit requests of federal prevention funding, AIDS-advocacy groups launched media e fforts claiming they were the \"target of intimidation\" by the Bush administration.17 According to one news report, \"Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy G. Thompson didn't beat around the bush when he sat down [ on October 31, 2002] with representatives of several AIDS-advocacy groups. ...'Now with the a udits, you've got to realize that not everyone agrees with you and me in Congre ss. When you take federal dolla rs and have a sex party or a gay stripper you're going to have audits. Mayb e you should use other money to hire a stripper. Audits are there to find out what's working. I believe in audits.'\" 18 Reports from the meeting did not indicate whether the HHS Secretary informed attendees that events with strippers are likely counterproductiv e to HHS's and CDC's disease prevention goals or, at the very least, are not on any respected lists of successful diseas e prevention strategies. E ASY TO CURE, YET CDC' S GOAL REMAINS ELUSIVE : The CDC's reframed 2006 elimination effort noted that, \"Despite recent challenges, generally low syphilis rates provide an opportunity to achieve this goal. Syphilis elimination is possible because the disease is easy to cure once dia gnosed, and because the syphilis epidemic is concentrated in a small number of geographic areas. In 2004, more than 50 percent of infectious (also called primary and secondary, or P&S) s yphilis cases were reported from just 20 U.S. counties. \"Elimination of syphilis would have far-reaching public health benefits because it would remove two serious consequences of the disease \u2014 increased likelihood of HIV transmission, and serious complications in pregnanc y and childbirth, such as spontane ous abortions, stillbirths, and congenital syphilis (syphilis among newborns who acquired it from their mothers).\" T HOUGH THERE IS SOME PROGRESS TO REPORT AMONG WOMEN AND INFANTS : According to the CDC, rates of congenital syphilis have declined 39 percent, while overall, there has been a 92 percent decrease in cases of congenital syphilis since 1991. Because, untreated syphilis during pregnancy can lead to stillbirth, neonata l death, or infant disorders, such as deafness, neurological impairment, and bone defo rmities, this progress has had a significant impact on many lives. Also, from 1999 to 2004, primary and seconda ry syphilis rates \"among all women have decreased 55 percent (from 2.0 to 0.9 cases per 100,000).\" 19 65PLAYING WITH STATISTICS : While there was temporary success with decr easing rates among African Americans, CDC statistics show the syphilis rates began to clim b back up among this subgroup in 2004. Instead of reporting this known setback, CDC's fiscal ye ar 2007 budget summary \u2014 which justifies the agency's budget request \u2014 uses old statistics to report \"significant progress\" in its syphilis elimination campaign. The report states, \"Between 1999 and 2004, primary and secondary syphilis rates among black Americans have de creased 37 percent (from 14.3 to 9.0 cases per 100,000)\" (emphasis added). 20 While this five year decreas e was significant, leaving out the years directly proceeding the 2007 budget (which showed something other than \"significant progress\"), could be an oversight or could be s een as CDC intentionally using statistics that advance the agency's requ est for additional funding. CDC THEORY ON SETBACKS \u2014 HIGH-RISK BEHAVIOR & \"HOMOPHOBIA \": The 2006 \"Together We Can\" CDC initiative notes: \"Despite these gains, however, overall rates of primary and secondary syphilis have been on the rise since 2001 presenting challenges and new opportunities for reframing our efforts. By 2004, more than 60% of new diagnoses of P&S s yphilis were estimated to occur in men who have sex with men (MSM), with HIV-positive MSM bearing a disproportionate burden of disease. The rising incidence of syphilis in MSM is in part attributable to recent increases in high-risk sexual behavior. High rates of new se x partner acquisition and partner change rates with rises in unprotected ... sex have been documented across the United States. \"The reasons for the increases are complex, however HIV sero-sorting [the practice of choosing or sorting one's sexua l partners based on their HIV status], safer sex fatigue, recreational drug use (especia lly crystal methamphetamine), and HIV treatment optimism combined with expansions in venues and networks that facilitate risky behaviors, have been identified among the major driving factors.\"21 One observer reports that, in fact, crystal me thamphetamine causes erect ile dysfunction (E.D.), but the advent of E.D. drugs such as Viagra has helped to counter the effect and, in combination with popular \"circuit parties\" among homosexua l men, has led to the spread of HIV (and presumably other sexually transmitted diseases, such as syphilis). 22 CDC, without explanation or s upporting evidence, appears to corre late an individual's decision to engage in risky sexual beha vior with the feelings that society reportedly has regarding homosexuality: \"All this has occurred within the context of hom ophobia and discrimination being experienced by many MSM.\" 23 Dr. Khalil Ghanem, assistant professor of medici ne at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, agrees increasing rate s among gay men could be attri buted to illicit drug use and \"safe-sex fatigue,\" but also notes that preven tion messages might have been \"drowned out\" due to publicized reports of how AIDS medications are working. \"We've been seduced by these amazing drugs and we've fallen behind in our prevention efforts,\" Dr. Ghanem told Medical 66News Today . \"We have to get back on track with prev ention messages. That's the only way we will curb this outbreak.\"24 CDC' S TUSKEGEE SYPHILIS EXPERIMENTS HINDERS EFFORTS ; CDC EMPLOYEE INEXPLICABLY SAYS BLACKS NEED TO TAKE \"THE RESPONSIBILITY \" FOR TUSKEGEE According to the CDC, syphilis elimination effo rts meet with distrust and therefore some resistance in the African American community b ecause of the federal government's involvement with a study later known as the \"ethically unjustified\" Tuskegee human experiments.25 In 1932, the United States Public Health Servi ce (PHS), in cooperation with the Tuskegee Institute (an institute founded to educate free men, former slaves, and thei r children), initiated a study in Macon County, Alabama, to determine the effects of untreated syphilis. The study would last until 1970 and follow 399 black men diagnosed with syphilis. Though in 1943 penicillin was widely known and us ed to cure syphilis, the study subjects were not offered penicillin and local physicians, dr aft boards and PHS vener eal disease eradication programs were given a list of the \"subjects\" to en sure they would not be treated. After the media exposed the study, it was halted in 1970. 26 The Tuskegee syphilis study was a covert medical research study. However, it was widely known in medical circles b ecause articles about it were publishe d in major medical journals. As late as 1969, a committee at the CDC examined th e study and agreed to allow it to continue. 27 In 1995, CDC brought together \"African American external consultants to participate in a consultation meeting with Center for Disease Control and Preven tion (CDC) staff, during which they could explore new ways to define and frame the problem of syphilis in the South among African Americans. The group was asked to consider potential inte rvention strategi es to address the epidemic.\" The group discussed \"the Tu skegee Study and its legacy\" and it was mentioned that that CDC had never officially apologized for the Tuskegee Study (though President Bill Clinton subsequently issued a national apology in May 1997). 28 According to the meeting minutes, a CDC employ ee appears to blame African Americans for the unethical experiments imposed on them: A CDC staff person commented, \"This is not as simple as people want to make it, like people do with racism. Racism is a very comple x thing, not as simple as we like to try to make it. The experiment could not have b een done without the help of the Tuskegee Institute. If blacks do not take the [their sh are of] responsibility, then such an incident could certainly happen again.\" Note: the phrase \"their share of\" is added in brackets by the CDC editor, thus indicating it was not in the original CDC employee's quote. 67MEETING THE GOAL: After steady increases in federal funding and m illions of dollars spent trying to eliminate syphilis, CDC is left with at least one gross misu se of funds in a community with rising syphilis rates, and with a fluctuating disease elimin ation deadline. As one commentator wrote, \"Eliminating syphilis was going to be another notch in the belt of public health. But the disease and the people spreadi ng it are not cooperating.\"29 Yet eliminating syphilis is still a worthwhile and hopefully attainable goal for the CDC. It is not clear whether CDC's third dead line for eliminating syphilis using an \"evidence-based and culturally competent prevention and control action plan\" will finally propel the agency toward meeting its goal. 30 Patient education, access to testing and treatment, tracking of at-risk sexual partners, and better screening of syphilis grantees should be an integral part of the CDC's syphilis elimination effort. Paying grante es to hire porn st ars should not be. 1 \"The National Plan to Eliminate Syphilis from the United States,\" CDC, October 1999, http://www.cdc.gov/stopsyphilis/plan.pdf ; http://www.cdc.gov/stopsyphilis/SEEPlan2006.pdf elimination is defined by the CDC \"as the absence of sust ained transmission of the disease.\" 2 http://www.cdc.gov/stopsyphilis/plan.pdf . 3\"Trends in Reportable Sexually Transmitted Diseases 4 Diseases, Syphilis,\" The Merck Manual of Medical Information--Home Edition, February 2003, http://www.merck.com/mmhe/print/sec17/ch200/ch200b.html ; \"Healthbeat,\" Illinois Department of Public Health, http://www.idph.stat e.il.us/public/hb/hbsyph.htm . 5 \"Sexually Transmitted Diseases, An Overview for Women,\" CDC/OD Office of Women's Health, November, 1997, http://www.thebody.com/cdc/stdoverview.html . 6 \"SYPHILIS: The Persistent Public Enemy: Syphilis is cheap and easy to cure.

Note: The number of cases corresponds to the calendar year, while the funding figures correspond to the fiscal year. For example, in calendar year 1998, CDC reported 7191 primary and se condary syphilis cases, while it received $2.4 million in fiscal year 1998, which encompassed October 1997 through September 1998.

The \"national, multicultural, social marketing campaign\" was called VERB, which comes from the \"verbs\" children are encourag ed to perform, such as run, splash, hike, jump, and dance. 2 The program's motto is \"VERB it's what you do!\" A ccording to its website, VERB aims to make \"physical activity cool and fun for tweens.\"3 CDC TAKES TO THE AIRWAVES & TAKES MILLIONS TO THE PR FIRMS : On average, American children 8-to-18-year s old watch three hours a day of television.4 CDC took advantage of this fact by buying large amo unts of advertising, mostly on cable channels such as Nickelodeon and Disney, essentially tel ling kids to watch less television and go be active.5 The following three advertising agencies collect ively received over $170 million in tax dollars: Frankel (Chicago), 6 Saatchi & Saatchi (New York City), and Garcia 360 (Hispanic/Latino audience). Garcia 360 then subcontracted to A Partnership, Inc. (Asian American/Pacific Islander audience), G&G Advertising (America n Indian/Alaska Native audience), and PFI Marketing (African American audience).7 The hundreds of millions of federal dollars were successful in raising awareness among so-called tweens about the VERB campaign \u2014 74 percent of those surveyed had heard about the campaign one year later \u2014 but whether or not the tweens did anythi ng about it is another question. 8 CDC justified spending millions to advertise VE RB to teenagers by noting that \"Obesity costs the country $117 billion dollars a year in medical expenses. Ma rketing programs like this one are proving to be successful in reducing the heal th and economic impact of this disease and are encouraging us to adopt similar strategies to address other prior ity health problems.\" 9 70SURVEY DOESN 'T SHOW CORRELATION \u2014 BUT CDC CLAIMS SUCCESS : In February 2004, CDC put out a press release cl aiming success because a survey showed VERB \"is Working\" and that \"Survey Findings Prove the VERB Campaign is Motivating Youth to Get Active.\"10 In actuality, the survey find ings, published in the journal Pediatrics found that tweens VERB had a very high level of awareness about VERB, and that some subgroups of children were more active, but what was less clear (des pite the authors' claims in one section) was whether or not VERB was causing or even affecting the children's activity levels. The survey's authors concl uded that, \"Promoting physical activity with child-focused commercial advertising shows promise,\" but also indicated that the survey found: \"no overall effect on free-time physical activity sessi ons was detected at the total- population level[;] \"At the total-population level, no relationship was found between levels of awareness and percentage of children engaging in organized physical activity [; and] \"No pattern of effects was detected for the previous-day physical activity measure or the measure of trying a new physical activity in the past 2 months\" (emphasis added). 11 KIDS DO ONE MORE ACTIVITY ... WORTH HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF TAX DOLLARS ? What the authors found, and what CDC highlighted in its press release claiming success, was that certain subgroups of interv iewed children were more active a year after the VERB campaign started than before. The fact that these children knew about the VERB campaign and were more active than their peers who did not know about the VERB campaign led the CDC to claim that VERB motivated the change. The study's authors reported, \"The finding that 9- to 10-year-old children overall engaged in 1.1 more sessions of activity in th eir free time than did those not exposed to the campaign is a notable difference\" (emphasis added).12 The conclusion: the VERB program is deemed by the CDC as a \"success\" story in fighting childhood obesity because after hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars spent on advertising, some children in a targeted group did one more ac tivity in their free time, which may or may not be related to their having watched a CDC-funded ad. The taxpayer-funded activitie s through VERB include: ViRTS: Tweens can create their own physical activity tracking log by creating a ViRT, \"a virtual player that tweens energi ze by recording the time they spend being physically active;\" Play Without Borders: \"Students can check out popular games from around the world and discover new ways to play;\" and Yellow Ball: VERB yellowball \"is a big, bouncy, world-changing idea that was created to spread play to ev ery kid in America. Here's the deal. We're scattering thousands of yellow balls all across the count ry. It's up to you to find one, play with it, and most importantly, pass it on. ...Nothi ng replaces the rush and exhilaration of 71physical activity. Yellowball igni tes desire for physical activ ity freeing kids to play out their dreams \u2014 I can't NOT play!\"13 CDC's VERB campaign also provided Cro ssover Community Organization Kits for organizations that directly serve tweens, whic h included taxpayer funded bracelets, wrist bands and vinyl inflatable basketballs.14 CONGRESS DEFUNDS VERB ... YET IT KEEPS ON GOING ... Congress defunded the VERB campaign in 2006 and yet CDC continued to promote and operate the campaign in 2006. In response to congressi onal inquiry, CDC repor ted that the 2006 VERB activities were funded through the previous year's appr opriations. The approximately $51.1 million in VERB 2006 expenditures included: $36.8 million for advertising, $8.6 million for events (including \"multiple in-market events to directly reach tweens across the nation in their communities such as the VERB mobile tour , VERB guerilla marketing, and VERB street teams\"), $1.9 million for Community & In-school pr ojects (including those at summer camps), $1.9 million for a Tween Website (http://www.verbnow.com/ ) featuring a \"places to play\" activity finder, \"pro e-cards, jokes, and the Yellowball \"blog-a- ball\" (which allows to blog their latest Yellowball acti vities), and $1.9 million for public relations outreach.15 According to CDC, the VERB program was to officially end on September 30, 2006, and the website was to end on December 31, 2006.16 1 Federal Register, December 4, 2006, http://a257.g.akamaitech.net/7/2 57/2422/01jan20061800/e docket.access.gpo.gov/2 006/pdf/E6- 20417.pdf ; Congressional Testimony by Diane Canova of Research to Prevention to House Subcommittee on Labor-HHS- Education Appropriations, May 14, 2003, http://www.researchtoprevention.org/html/pressevents/events6- 2003canova.pdf , accessed October 2006. 2\"VERB,\" House Republican Study Committee (RSC) document, dated February 2006, FY01 - $125 million, Olds,\" by Roberts DF, Foehr UG, by Duke and Carrie D.

While property owners, legislatures, and environmentalists battle it out in the publ ic square over land-use issues, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention provided the re sources to produce a pa per decrying \"sprawl.\" The CDC funded, and CDC employees co-wrote, a paper published in 2001 by the political advocacy group Sprawlwatch, which is a \"slo w-growth\" special interest organization. 1 The CDC-funded paper defines the term sprawl as \"uncontrolled, poorly pl anned, low-density, and single-use community growth [that] depends on individual motor vehicles to flourish.\" \"THOUGHTLESS DEVELOPMENT \" AT AMERICA 'S PERIL : The CDC-funded paper hypothesizes that the health of American s is suffering due to urban sprawl and a dependency on automobiles. The Director of the CDC' s National Center for Environmental Health criticize s (without defining) America's \"thoughtless\" development: \"As America increasingly becomes a nation that permits and even encourages thoughtless development and unmanaged growth, the impact of these factors grows clearer, and we ignore them at our peril.\" Though many new property developments are built with sidewalks and even bike paths, the CDC's Environmental Health Director asserts, \"T here is a connection, for example, between the fact that the urban sprawl we live with daily ma kes no room for sidewalks or bike paths and the fact that we are an overweight, he art disease-ridden society.\" Evidently, the CDC director implies, public health officials cannot encourage people to exercise, if they do not first ensure the people have \"welcoming\" exercise environments. \"It is dishonest to tell our citizens to walk, jog, or bicycle when there is no safe or welcoming place to pursue these 'life-saving' activities.\" 2 PAPER ASSERTS VIOLENCE STEMS FROM COMMUNITIES WITHOUT PARKS : The paper's authors might be accused of oversimp lifying America's woes when they write, \"The question that remains is whether communities wa nt to spend money up front to create an environment that prevents violence and increases psychological well-being or whether they want to spend money after the fact to address the violence and stress which results from communities without parks and communal areas.\" In fact, local police reports reflect the reality that parks sometimes can become hangouts for gang members and locations for neighborhood crime. 3 73... AND PARKING LOTS ENCOURAGE SEDENTARY LIVING : The paper describes residential areas that reflect \"the supposition that people will drive to most destinations.\" And says that certain designs \"en courage sedentary living ha bits\" such as parking lots \"built as close as possible to final de stinations to increase convenience and safety for motorists.\" Y ET CDC' S OWN STUDY SHOWS SUBURBANITES THE HEALTHIEST : Yet, an official CDC study released the same year, in September 2001, entitled \"Health, United States, 2001,\" found that suburbani tes are the healthiest people in the country, exercising more and living longer than resident s of rural and urban areas.4 The official CDC report, for example, found that suburban women are the group least likely to be obese. Furthermore, a 2000 study in the American Journal of Public Health concluded that city-dwellers face a greater mortality risk compar ed to people living in suburbs or rural areas, even after controlling for demographic differences such as age, race, sex, education, income, and marital status. 5 The same study also found that suburbanites are the most physically active group.6 In a letter dated January 14, 2002, Congressman Mark Souder (R -IN), the Chairman of the House Subcommittee on Criminal Justice, Drug Policy, and Human Resources, requested additional information about the study from the CDC, but to da te CDC officials have never responded. 1 \"Creating A Healthy Environment: The Impact of the Built Environment on Public Health\", undated 2001 paper by Richard J.

CDC CREATES SECTION TO INVESTIGATE GUN VIOLENCE : In the late 1980s, the CDC created the Intentional Injuries Secti on within the Division of Injury Epidemiology and Control. The section, accordi ng to its acting chief Dr. Patrick O'Carroll, was focused \"not on firearms, but on homicides. We 've tried to bring a somber approach to determining what role firearms ha ve in violence,\" he told the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA ) in 1989. \"Clearly, if th ree fourths of homicides are caused by firearms, we have to look at their role.\"2 Dr. O'Carroll's quotes in this JAMA article set off a firestorm re garding CDC's role with guns and gun control. The article said: \"Bringing about 'gun control,' whic h itself covers a variety of ac tivities from registration to confiscation, was not the specific reason for the [CDC's violence prevention] section's creation, O'Carroll says. However, the fact s themselves tend to make some form of regulation seem desirable, he says: 'The way we're going to do this is to systematically build a case that owning firearms causes death.'\" 3 Dr. O'Carroll also was quoted by JAMA as saying: \"We're doing the most we can do, given the po litical realities. The problem is you have polemicists from both camps [gun control advoc ates and opponents] exerting influence, and Congress is very wary. Even the question of parents restricting thei r own children's use of firearms causes some people to get upset\" (brackets inserted in original article).4 These quotes were used by gun rights defenders to show the CDC \u2014 an agency created to study and prevent diseases \u2014 was changing its mi ssion to not only study guns but to promote gun control. Dr. O'Carroll wrote a lett er to the editor of JAMA saying: \"... I do not 1989 JAMA article] accu rately portrays either my approach to injury prevention research or that of the Centers for Disease Control. ...I am correctly described as saying that the CDC will bring a sober, scientific approach to determining what effect the accessibility of fir earms may have on the risk of violent injury. Unfortunately, the next paragraph misquotes me and indicates quite the opposite \u2014 that the CDC is trying 'to systematically build a case that owning firearms causes deaths.' ...We at the CDC have been careful to avoid such a biased approach.\" 5 75GUN CONTROL NOW OR GUN CONTROL EVENTUALLY ? Three years later, CDC officials were still explaining their work with guns, again provoking controversy. In a June 10, 1992 article entitled, \"Let's Be Clear: Violen ce is a Public Health Problem,\" three CDC doctors, including Dr. O' Carroll and Dr. Rosenberg (who would later direct CDC's center studying guns) wr ote: \"Just as we were able to save countless lives from motor vehicle injuries without banning cars, we can save many lives from firearm injuries without a total ban on firearms.\" The use of th e phrase \"total ban,\" rais ed the specter that a partial ban on firearms was something the CDC re searchers and the agency itself may have been contemplating. The authors continued, \"Parents should be encouraged and assisted in every possible way to prevent their children from carrying guns or having unsupervised access to guns.\" 6 For the parents who teach their children to hunt using guns, this quote was also controversial. On June 25, 1992, soon after the violence-is-a-health -problem article appe ared, CDC created the National Center for Injury Prevention and Contro l (NCIPC), which increased the former section that studied firearms to an entire center dedicated to injury prevention. 7 The NCIPC's mission was to increase research and monitoring of injuri es caused by fire and accidents, which the unit determined included firearms-related injuries.8 By 1995, $2.3 million, or five percent, of the NCIPC's budget of $46 million went to firearm-related research.9 In 1993, the NCIPC Director's Mark Rosenberg was interviewed for a Rolling Stone article entitled \"Gunning for guns.\" The article said: \"[Government] Firearms [working group] co-cha ir Rosenberg says the group is looking to develop strategies to 'refra me the debate' on guns. 'We're trying to get away from this notion of gun control,' Rosenberg says. He envisions a long-term campaign, similar to those on tobacco use and auto safety, to c onvince Americans that guns are, first and foremost, a public-health menace. 'We didn't ha ve to ban cars,' he says 'We made cars safer. We made roads safer. We reduced drunk driving.'\" 10 Some skeptics might note that the end goal for those focused on \"long-term campaigns\" on tobacco use, for example, was to actually stop al l Americans from smoking and to use lawsuits to drive American tobacco companies out of business. CDC OFFICIALS FEATURED AT GUN CONTROL EVENTS AND AGENCY FUNDS USED TO ADVOCATE GUN CONTROL : According to a report sent to the U.S. Senate by the watchdog group Doctors for Integrity in Policy Research Inc. (DIPR) , at the Handgun Epidemic Lowering Plan (HELP) strategy conference in 1993 and again in 1995, the CDC's NC IPC researchers and staff were listed as faculty for a conference \"described by its organi zer as uniting 'concerned pr ofessionals' to assist in making it 'socially unacceptable for private citizens to have handguns.'\"11 76The CDC's NCIPC also funded a spring 1995 Injury Prevention Network Newsletter entitled, \"Women, Guns and Domestic Violence,\" which in cluded an article entitled \"What Advocates Can Do.\" The article included advice for resear chers and CDC public health staffers such as: \"Put gun control on the agenda of your civi c or professional orga nization. Release a statement to the media or explain in your organization's newslette r why gun control is a woman's (or nurses' or pe diatricians'...) issue. \"...Make your support for federal, state, and local gun laws known to your representative. This may include: Opposing repeal of the a ssault weapons ban; maintaining support for the Brady Law; restricting ammunition avai lability by caliber and quantity; increasing enforcement of federal firearm laws; maintain ing restrictions on issuance of concealed weapons permits... \"Organize a picket at gun manufacturing sites, perhaps with posters showing pictures of victims of gun violence. (Modeled after the Madres de los Desaparecidos in Argentina and Chile; this can evoke a ve ry powerful moral image.) \"Work for campaign finance reform to weaken the gun lobby's political clout. \"Boycott publications that accept advertising from the gun lobby or manufacturers ... Launch a program aimed at getting pediatri cians [involved] ... Get media attention for your events. Encourage your local police de partment to adopt a policy prohibiting officers from recommending that ci tizens buy guns for protection ...\"12 James Mercy, M.D., Director of the Violence Pr evention Division of the CDC, gave a March 11, 1995 interview that reported, \"Dr. Mercy and othe rs who are alarmed at the increase in handgun injuries and deaths hope that out of this broadened perspective, a perspective based on scientific inquiry, Americans will begin to move more cauti ously in regard to the purchase and ownership of firearms. Dr. Mercy said, 'The public often bu ys without taking into a ccount the risks. There is little evidence to show that handguns have a protective effect.'\" 13 The CDC Division Director is also quoted questioning th e marketing campaigns of gun manufactures. \"Efforts to highlight the risk s of handgun ownership have been made more difficult, however, by the adve rtising campaigns of gun manuf acturers that present what advocates of gun control regard as misinformati on, particularly with re gard to the protection claim. 'Some companies are trying to expa nd their markets by targeting women,' Dr. Mercy said, 'suggesting that women have most to fear from strangers, whereas the greatest danger of violence is from co-habitants.'\" 14 CONGRESS GETS INVOLVED : In October 1995, a letter signed by eight Senato rs, including Senators Bob Dole (R-KS) and Trent Lott (R-MS), said that the CDC's NCIP C agency was wasteful, biased and driven by \"preordained political goals and not from the desi re for scientific, balanced and unbiased inquiry. ...This CDC program can be cut with no diminuti on of service in administering the public interest, and at a savi ngs to the taxpayer.\"15 77CONGRESS QUESTIONED CDC' S INVOLVEMENT WITH GUNS: On March 6, 1996, the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education held a hearing where testimony focused on what one witness reported were \"the CDC's NCIPC's use of suspect da ta, skewed study populations, dubious research models, and result-oriented research.\" Tes timony, according to the same witness, was also offered \"concerning the inappropriate diversion of taxpayer monies to research for dissemination of partisan newsletters, as well as the particip ation of NCIPC staff and researchers in partisan anti-gun gatherings.\"16 In July 1996, the House Appropriations Committee passed an amendment by Congressman Jay Dickey (R-AR) to an appropriations bill to sh ift $2.6 million away from the NCICP, an amount determined to be equivalent to funds spen t by the NCIPC for its gun campaign. When the appropriations bill came before the full Hous e on July 11, 2006, Congresswoman Nita Lowey (D-NY) unsuccessfully attempted to restor e the NCICP's $2.6 million budget for firearm research. 17 Congresswoman Lowey argued, \"Gun violence in America is a public health emergency. According to Dr. George Lundberg, an editor of the Journal of the American Medical Association , 'There is no question now that violence is a public health issue. Research to end this epidemic of violence is absolute ly vital and it must continue.'\" Congressman Dickey countered that \"this is an issue of federally funded political advocacy. We have here an attempt by the CDC through the NCIP C, a disease control ag ency of the Federal Government, to bring about gun control advocac y all over the United States through seminars, through the staff members and thro ugh the funding of different effo rts all over the country just on this one issue, to raise emotional sympathy for those people who are for gun control. It is a blatant attempt on the part of government to federally fund lobbying and political advocacy. Rather than calling violence a di sease and guns as a germ, these people should be looking at the other root causes of crime: Poverty, drug trade, gangs, and children growing up without parental support, and the cruel trap of welfare dependency. Those things have more to do with crime control than trying to come at it from a disease definition.\" 18 Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi, the future Speaker of the House, urged support for the amendment saying, \"We need CDC research and expe rtise to help inform the Nation, to help gun owners have safety.\" 19 Congressman Bob Barr (R-GA) said, \"Look up the word 'disease' in the dict ionary, at least any legitimate dictionary. I have done it. There is no reference in any dictiona ry that I can find that says that accidents or handgun injuries or murders are a disease. There is a reason why they are not found within a definition of disease. They are not diseases. ...[T] he Centers for Disease Control have not eradicated disease. In other wo rds, they have work left to do, very important work they could be doing. Yet they are devoting scarce resources for a political agenda that is, pure and simple, a political ag enda ... [and t]he political agenda is well-documented.\" Barcia (D-MI) pointed out that NCIPC's work is duplicative, that \"firearms violence is studied already by a number of agencies within the De partment of Justice, including the National Institutes of Justice and the Bureau of Justice Statistics as well as the Bureau of Justice Assistance and other programs. In fact, Dr. Arthur Kellermann, an NCIPC grantee recipient who has received millions of taxpayer dollars to study firearms, recently received a grant from the Department of Justice to study firearms violence, a clear indication of the duplicative nature of NCIPC's work in this area.\" 21 Congresswoman Lowey's amendment to restor e funds was defeated by a 158-263 vote in the House of Representatives. The House-Senate conference did restore th e funds, but earmarked the money to study traumatic brain injuries in stead, and thus the CDC's 1997 budget for firearm injury related research dropped 80 percent to $500,000. 22 CDC CAN STILL STUDY GUNS BUT GRANTEES CANNOT PROMOTE GUN CONTROL : The final bill signed into law also included specific language inserted by Congressman David Obey (D-WI) and Congressman Bob Livingston (R-L A) that stated: \"None of the funds made available for injury prevention and control at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention may be used to advocate or promote gun control.\"23 Congress modified the CDC gun co ntrol provision in the annual a ppropriations bill for fiscal year 2003 to read: \"None of the f unds made available for injury prevention and control at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention may be used, in whole or in part , to advocate or promote gun control\" (emphasis added). The ap propriations committee also included new report language which reads in part: \"The conferees acknowledge that the purpose of this proviso is to prohibit Federal funds from being used to lobby for or against the passage of specific Fede ral, State or local legislation intended to advocat e or promote gun control. The conferees understand that the CDC's responsibility in this area is primarily data colle ction and the dissemination of information and expect research in this area to be objective and grants to be awarded through an impartial, scientific peer review pr ocess. The conferees instruct the CDC to provide a detailed report, within 90 days of enactment, on the steps the CDC has taken to ensure this restriction is being followed.\" 24 In an undated letter to its gran tees, the directors of the CDC' s NCIPC and the Procurement and Grants Office stated that: \"CDC interprets the appropria tions and conference report la nguage regarding gun control to mean that CDC's funds may not be sp ent on political action or other activities designed to affect the passage of specific Federal, State, or local legislation intended to restrict or control the purchas e or use of firearms. This new appropriations requirement still supports CDC's work to: collect and support the collec tion of data related to fi rearm-related injuries; 79 engage in objective scie ntific, public health rese arch awarded through an impartial, scientific peer review process, directed to preventing injuries related to violence and firearms; and publish and disseminate the results of firearm-related injury research and surveillance data. \"Importantly, recipients of CDC funds are su bject to the same limitations in using CDC injury prevention and control funds. Recipien ts are expected to establish appropriate fiscal control and other mechanisms to ensu re that CDC funds are not used to promote specific legislation that restri cts or controls the purchase or use of firearms through conferences, public events, publicati ons, and 'grassroots' activities.\"25 These provisions continue to be included in the annual appropriations bills, and thus CDC currently is not prohibited from studying guns and gun violence as a disease or a health problem, but merely is prohibited from allowing its gr antees and funds to be used for gun control advocacy.26 OVER A DECADE LATER CDC TASKFORCE SAYS EFFECTS OF GUN CONTROL LAWS UNKNOWN : In October 2003, the CDC published findings fr om the Task Force on Community Preventive Services which \"conducted a systematic review of scientific evidence rega rding the effectiveness of firearms laws in preventing violence, incl uding violent crimes, suicide, and unintentional injury.\" The Task Force \"found insufficient evid ence to determine the e ffectiveness of any of the firearms laws or combinations of laws reviewed on violent outcomes.\"27 The Task Force also found insufficient evidence to determine wh ether the laws reviewed reduce (or increase) specific violent outcomes because much \"existing research suffers from problems with data, analytic methods, or both.\"28 So after years of CDC classifying guns as a pub lic health threat and af ter years of CDC funding groups that advocate gun control laws, the CD C's own research conc ludes it is not known whether gun control laws reduce or even increase violent crimes. 1 \"Ideological and Civil Liberties Implications of the Public Health Approach to Guns, Crime and Violence,\" Raymond G.

Wh ile most Americans have grown to trust the statistics that come out of the CDC, so me of that trust, at leas t as far as obesity death statistics goes, might have been misplaced. O BESITY ANNOUNCED AS NUMBER TWO KILLER IN THE NATION : In March 2004, just months after CDC launched a high-profile effort against obesity, the CDC claimed obesity causes 400,000 deaths a year.1 The claim appeared in a study, published in the March 10, 2004 issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA ), which estimated there were 435,000 deaths associated with tobacco use compared with 400,000 deaths from \"poor diet and physical inactivity.\"2 The study's four authors included the CDC's Director, Dr. Julie Gerberding. As the study was released, CDC officials issued dire warnings and ur ged the nation to take action. 3 According to one news report, \"Some crit ics in the food industry and academia contend that the CDC ignored early signs that its death estimates were flawed to avoid undermining its ongoing crusade against obesity.\"4 A May 2004 article in Science magazine quoted various re searchers and anonymous CDC employees who said the evidence behind the obes ity numbers were \"weak\" or \"loosey-goosey.\" Critics noted that the study's authors added an arbitrary number of deaths from poor nutrition (15,000) to the obesity category, which inflated the statistics. 5 A CDC scientist says internal di scussions on these issues got \"very contentious\" months before publication and left some feeling that the conclusions were not debatable. 6 The authors disagreed and one explained that the stipulated 15,000 deaths fr om poor nutrition in the obesity section, for example, represent a \"conservati ve estimate\" obtained by tripling 4,242, the number of death certificates citing this cause in 2000.7 82In January 2005, the CDC admitted making calculati on errors and lowered its death estimate to 365,000 \u2014 but still ranked obesity as the number tw o most preventable cause of U.S. deaths.8 OBESITY ANNOUNCEMENT REVISED 1,400 PERCENT \u2014 NOT AS DEADLY AS ONCE THOUGHT : But in April 2005, in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA ), the CDC revised its estimate to put the annual death toll from obesity at only 25,814. Th e April 2005 numbers are 15 times less than the earlier estimate and drop ob esity to the seventh most preventable cause of death, behind car crashes and gunshot wounds.9 The study, led by Katherine M. Flegal of the Nationa l Center for Health St atistics, a branch of the CDC, analyzed mortality according to a pe rson's BMI, or body mass index, which measures weight and height. The study s howed that being modestly over weight, but not obese, \"was not associated with excess mortality\" or a shorter life expectancy. In fact, the research studied showed that being overweight is actually less of a mortality risk factor than being of normal weight. \"The major reason our numbers are lower is that we used some new data sets that provide more recent, better information,\" said David Williams on, senior epidemiologist for the CDC, who was an investigator in the study. Dr. Julie Gerberdi ng, the CDC's Director, said the CDC will strive to improve its methods for calculating the health consequences of obesity. 10 CDC PRESS CONFERENCE ANNOUNCES OBESITY IS STILL BAD: In June 2005, the CDC Director held a press co nference where she acknowledged potential flaws in the April 2005 JAMA study led by Flegal. \"It is not okay to be overweight. People need to be fit, they need to have a healthy diet, they need to exercise,\" she said. \"I'm very sorry for the confusion that these scien tific discussions have had.\"11 Some scientists from the Harvard School of Pub lic Health, the American Heart Association and the American Cancer Society have rejected the conclusions from Flegal's April 2005 study, saying the study's main flaw was that it included people with hea lth problems, such as cancer and heart disease, who tend to wei gh less because of those problems. No one discounts that obesity is a serious pr oblem in America. The American Obesity Association estimates that 64.5 percent of adu lt Americans, approximately 127 million people, are categorized as being overweight or obese. Accurately compiling stat istics in a nation of hundreds of millions of people is challenging, and accurately tracking weight, which many people consider private and pers onal information, obviously has its limitations. But the fact that CDC, the agency tasked with helping to preven t and control disease and which testifies yearly before Congress about the diseas es \"caused\" by obesity, released estimates adjusted by 1,400 percent within just one year, does not lead to confidence in CD C statistics and may lead to public confusion about obesity. Such confusion can be a deadly complication in an area of disease prevention that directly affects millions of people's lives. 83 1 \"Study is seen as clouding risks to the overweight,\" Boston Globe , May 9, 2005. 2 on Everyone's Plate,\" JAMA, 2004; 291: 5 \"Public Enemy Number On e: Tobacco or Obesity?\" Science , May 7, 2004. 6 Ibid. 7 Id. 8 \"CDC says obesity deaths overestimated,\" The Washington Times , April 20, 2005. 9 Ibid. 10 Id. 11 \"CDC Chief Backs Away From Report On Obesity,\" Associated Press , June 3, 2005. 84IG Investigates Abuse of CDC Funds Just three investigations find over a million dollars misused While some CDC grant recipients react with outrage at the mere suggestion that their books be audited, the Inspector General managed to find, in just three cases (two of which were HIV/AIDS grantees), the misuse of over a million dolla rs in CDC funds.1 MASSACHUSETTS : The HHS Inspector General (IG) found a possible misu se of federal HIV/AIDS funds in its audit of the CDC-funded Multicultura l AIDS Center (MAC) of Boston, Massachusetts. Over the course of two years, MAC received $948,000 from the CDC: $408,000 during 2001, $180,000 during 2002 from CDC via the Commonwealth of Mass achusetts Department of Public Health's HIV/AIDS Prevention and Educa tion Cooperative Agreement, and $360,000 in fiscal year 2002 from the CDC under the Community Co alition Development (CCD) Project.2 According to the IG audit released in January 2003, \"two MAC employees, whose salaries were paid with CDC funds, appeared to be involve d in lobbying activities \u2014 an unallowable charge under federal regulations. ...[I]t is possible that a portion of the [FY02] total charges of $360,000 to the CDC's Community Coalition Developm ent Project may have supported unallowable lobbying activities.\" The stated purpose of the program for which MA C received funds is \"to improve and support the health of the African American communities disproportionately affected by HIV, sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), tuberculosis (TB) and substance abuse within their respective communities.\"3 Funds made available under this program must support activitie s directly related to primary HIV prevention and the prevention of other STDs, TB, and substance abuse, according to the IG report. The misused CDC fu nds had been intended \"to sustain, improve, and expand HIV prevention services for racial/ethnic minority populations.\"4 In 2003, the House Subcommittee on Criminal Ju stice, Drug Policy and Human Resources asked HHS what, if any, actions were taken agains t MAC for violating federal lobbying laws and misusing funds for African American communities, though, to date, no response has been received. 5 In response to congressional inquir y in 2007, CDC reported that MAC has not received CDC funds since 2002.6 WASHINGTON , D.C.: CDC gave the Washington-based Lesbian, Bisexual and Transgender Organization federal funds for HIV/ AIDS education, includ ing $1.15 million in 2004, for the first year of a five-yea r grant. But in August 2004, five months after it received its federal grant, LLEGO closed its doors and file d for Chapter 7 bankruptcy after drawing down $989,255 of the CDC grant.7 85The HHS IG determined LLEGO had incurred $703,181 in \"unallowable costs,\" instead of funding promised HIV/AIDS education efforts. \"LLEGO engaged in activities not covered by CDC's program announcement, including lobbying, fund-raising and advocating on behalf of gay issues,\" the report concluded. In 2003, for instance, the organization's leaders rallied in Tallahassee, Florida, to s upport adoption by same-sex coupl es. The same year, the organization's leaders rallied in Sacramento to support same-sex marriages. According to a news report, the organization fu rther urged federal lawmakers to oppose a 2004 bill that would strip federal courts of the chance to hear cha llenges to the Defense of Marriage Act, which declares that states are not ob liged to recognize same-sex marriag es performed in other states.8 The federal government is seeking to reclai m more than $700,000 from LLEGO in bankruptcy court, though the group's bankruptcy attorney sa id the former employees \"are the only ones who are going to get paid, because of the limited am ount of money availabl e ... If there's anything left, it will go for taxes,\" he told a reporter. 9 In response to congressional i nquiry, CDC reported that it had f iled in bankruptcy court and was placed on the creditor list. As of Februa ry 2007, \"CDC has not recovered [any] funds.\" 10 GEORGIA : In May 2006, the Director of the CDC's Coordi nating Center for Health Promotion pleaded guilty in federal court to a char ge of theft of government funds for padding her travel expense accounts by an estimated $7,500. Over a three ye ar period, Donna Stroup submitted dozens of fraudulent claims and altered receipts for expens es not covered by the agency. Often, she wrote off personal expenses as FedEx or copying char ges. One such charge for $106.22 was described as PowerPoint slides, when instead it was a purch ase from Filene's Basement department store. According to the Atlanta-Journal Constitution , in 2004, Stroup \"was one of the authors of a widely reported study that said obesity was a bout to overtake smoking as the nation's leading cause of death.\" (See: \"CDC re vises U.S. obesity deaths by 1,400% ... then backtracks\" (page 81).) Stroup has since resigned.11 ARE THERE MORE CASES ? With billions of dollars spent annually on gr ant programs and hundreds of millions spent on grant administration and management, taxpayers would be justified in wondering how many more cases of waste and abuse exist, but have yet to be investigated. 1 \"Bush Administration Policies on Sex Education, Funding for AIDS Groups 'Hampering' Anti-AIDS Efforts, Organizations Say,\" Kaiser Daily HIV/AIDS Report , October 1, 2002; Daily HIV/AIDS Report, August 20, 2002; Inside the Beltway, The Washington Times, December 13, 2002. 2 \"Audit of HIV/AIDS Activities at the Multicultural AIDS Coalition for the Period July 1, 2000 through September 30, 2002, A-01-02-01503\", http://oig.h Plan, Congressional Justification Submission,\" February 2003, http://www.cdc.gov/od/perfplan/2003/2003perf.pdf , accessed January 2007. 5 E-mail correspondence from House Su bcommittee on Criminal Justice, Dr ug Policy and Human Resources to HHS, dated May 5, 2003. 86 6 E-mail correspondence from CDC Policy Analyst to office of Senator Tom Coburn dated February 5, 2007. 7 HHS Inspector General \"Review of grants issued to the National Latina/o Lesbian, Latino group asked to repay federal grants,\" McClatchy Newspapers, October 8, 2006, 9 Ibid.; Footnote 6, op. cit. 10 Supra footnote 6. 11 \"CDC staffer pleads guilty to fraudulent claims,\" The Atlanta Journal-Constitution , May 19, 2006. 87IT PAYS TO BE A CDC EMPLOYEE CDC Spends $1.7 Million fo r Hollywood Liaison Grant Terrorism and Toxic Subs tance Funds Tapped Former CDC Employee on Receiv ing End of Tinseltown Grant 1 Some employees watch soap operas on their lunch break or while their boss is not looking, but at the CDC watching soap operas is part of th e job description for the those with CDC's Entertainment Education Program. The CDC Entertainment Education Program collabor ates with \"entertainmen t industry leadership to provide accurate depictions of healthy livi ng at all life stages\" and also works to provide \"public health experts as a resour ce to entertainment industry writers.\" 2 It seeks to \"raise awareness and behavioral change\" by providing \"accurate depictions of healthy living at all stages of life ... to entertainment industry l eadership for possible inclusion in television storylines.\"3 In other words, the CDC spends tax dollars to ensure that when a made up character in a fictitious TV show talks about a health t opic, he or she talks about it accurately. 4 WHY CDC IS WATCHING DAYTIME AND PRIMETIME DRAMAS : According to the CDC, \"Popular entertainment provides an ideal outlet for sharing health information and affecting behavior.\" CDC says that since many Americas learn about health issues from television, \"we believe that prim e time and daytime television programs, movies, talk shows and more, are great ou tlets for our health messages.\"5 A question taxpayers might consider appropria te: should the CDC spend $1.9 million to help Hollywood develop its plotlines, and does this ty pe of assistance justify the use of terrorism funds? 88$1.75 MILLION CDC TAX DOLLARS SPENT SO FAR IN LIAISON WITH HOLLYWOOD (IN ADDITION TO $1.51 MILLION FROM THREE OTHER AGENCIES ); MORE IN THE PIPELINE : CDC's Entertainment Education Program began a co llaborative project with the University of Southern California Annenberg's Norman Lear Center on September 30, 2001, with $300,000 in federal funding. The Lear Center announced its \"Hollywood, Health & Society\" program in an April 2002 press release. 6 The Lear Center program has been the sole aw ard recipient of CDC's Entertainment Education Program. The total CDC funding awarded to the Hollywood, Health & Society program to date is as follows: $300,000 in fiscal year 2001 $400,000 in fiscal year 2002 $406,900 in fiscal year 2003 $281,500 in fiscal year 2004 $188,544 in fiscal year 2005 $158,500 in fiscal year 2006 $ 18,386 in fiscal year 2007 ____________________________ CDC Total: $1.75 million 7 The Lear Center has received fundi ng from three other federal agen cies in addition to the CDC. The National Cancer Institute (NCI) at the Nati onal Institutes of H ealth added additional taxpayer funds in 2006, along with the Agency fo r Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), and the Health Resources Services Administ ration's (HRSA) Division of Transplantation.8 Grants from these four federal agencies to the Norman Lear Center's Hollywood, Health & Society program equaled $513,500 in 2006 and $3.26 million from FY01-FY07. 9 The National Institutes of Health 's NCI found \"left over resources \" in its end of the year 2006 budget and used them to send $250,000 for the Hollywood-based liaison, according to the Institute's response to congr essional inquiry. NCI, fr om 2003 through 2006, has spent $1.25 million on the Hollywood, Health, and Society pr ogram. Of these funds , $1.1 million was \"for program operations\" and $150,000 was \"f or evaluation of outcomes.\" 10 The Hollywood, Health, and Society program received $55,000 from AHRQ in FY06, an agency which also paid out $55,000 in FY05 to the program. 11 HRSA contributed $50,000 in 2006 and $100,000 in 2007 to the Hollywood liaison grant and, according to the agency, its organ transplant expert s were able to correct \"misinformation\" about organ donations in fictitious television storyl ines such those FUNDS AMONG THOSE TAPPED TO FUND T.V. SHOW LIAISON : Of the $1.75 million CDC funds spent so far on the Hollywood liaison program, $1.31 million came from the Office of the Director's budget, $178,500 came fr om the Health Marketing budget, and $80,000 came from the Environm ental Health and Injury budget.13 Most puzzling, in a time of limited federal funds and agency calls for additional funds to prepare for potential bioterrorism att acks, is the decision to spe nd $55,000 from the CDC terrorism account (from the Health Education & Communi cation allotment), and $18,386 from the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Re gistry budget on the Hollywood program. 14 CDC SPENDS APPROXIMATELY $6,000 PER TELEVISION EPISODE CONSULT : CDC reported that efforts by the Hollywood, Hea lth & Society program under its cooperative agreement with the CDC have resulted in over 400 television episodes \"which have contained public health information\" nearly 90 of whic h \"presented public health issues in major storylines.\"15 In response to congressional inquiry, CDC re ported that from September 2001 through August 2006, there were 281 television epis odes requiring \"CDC Topics a nd Expert Consultations\" and an additional 29 episodes for the remainder of 2006 and the beginni ng of 2007 that received consultation (though it is not specified which of the four agencies performed these 29 consultations). 16 For $1.75 million in taxpayer funds, CD C's cooperative agreement with the Lear Center produced CDC topics and consultations for a tota l of somewhere between 281 and 310 episodes. This amounts to spending between $6,228 and $5,645 to consult per episode. S OLE AWARD RECIPIENT IS HEADED BY FORMER CDC EMPLOYEE : The Hollywood, Health & Society program (f unded by CDC's Entertainment Education Program) named Vicki Beck as its first program pr oject director. Beck's last job just happened to be running the Entertainment E ducation Program as a CDC employee. 17 In fact, not only had Beck run the CDC program, but she is credited with establishing the whole CDC entertainment program in the first place.18 How Beck created an office of entertainment at the CDC, watched as a Hollywood-based grantee won the sole grant from the federal agency, and then months later found herself as director of that very same grantee's CDC-funded program, is a case study in how it pays to be a former CDC employee. In response to congressional inquiry, CDC re ported that Vicki Beck 's CDC resignation was effective January 15, 2002, and though she was working for the Entertainment Education Program at CDC in September 2001 (when the L ear Center was informed of the CDC funding award), she \"did not participate in any as pect of the review or grant process.\" 19 The Lear Center's April 2002 release announcing its Hollywood program's launch bragged that its new director Beck was \"until earlier this year \" directing the Entertainment-Education 90Program at the CDC's headquarters in Atlanta.20 The fact that Beck did not personally choose the Hollywood, Health & Society program (that w ould later employ her) as a grantee, does not overshadow the fact that while she has been directing the Hollywood-based program, it received $1.7 millions tax dollars from an office she helped create at the CDC. HOLLYWOOD LIAISON GRANT TO RECEIVE $700,000 IN 2007; AND CDC LIKELY TO SEND $820,000 TO $1.2 MILLION OVER FIVE YEARS : Responses from the four federal agencies f unding the Hollywood, Health & Society program indicate the program has received over $3.2 million since its inception. But the Hollywood liaison program is not ending after receiving $1.7 million from the CD C (including from its terrorism budget), $1.25 million from the NCI, $150,000 from HRSA, and $110,000 from AHRQ. In fact, CDC has announced the availability of a one-year, $700,000 cooperative agreement for 2007 to continue the work begun by the Hollywood, Health & Society program in 2002. The agency is soliciting grant proposals through J une 7, 2007, for a non-profit, state or local government, or tribal entity to work with CDC in a cooperative agreemen t for a \"project period length\" of five years. 21 There is nothing precluding the Lear Center's \"Hollywood, Health & Society\" program from winning this next 5-year cooperative agreement. In response to congressional inquiry, CDC repor ted that the $700,000 award will come from four different agencies \u2014 CDC, NCI, HRSA, and AHRQ \u2014 with CDC contributing approximately $220,000 of the total amount. CDC' s 2007 portion of the cooperative agreement will include $160,000 from its Health Marketing budget and $60,000 from the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) budge t. CDC did note in its congres sional response that, \"it is possible that CDC will increase its funding allocation prior to and after the award date (September 30, 2007).\" 22 Despite CDC's report that three other agenci es will join it in funding the $700,000 grant for 2007, only HRSA has budgeted any funds. HRSA has contributed $100,000 toward the new grant in 2007. Of the two other agencies that are reportedly part of the interagency grant: AHRQ reported that it has no records \"of any funds for this [Interagency Agreement] in FY 2007\" and that \"There has not been a request submitted\" an d NCI stated, \"The availability of funds for obligation to CDC [contract with the Hollywood, Health, and Soci ety program for 2007] is still not known.\" 23 When asked how much CDC plans on funding for the remaining four years of this new five-year liaison grant, CDC replied \"We expect that CDC funding would be $150,000 to $250,000/year.\" So together with the $220,000 firs t-year award amount, over the next five years CDC expects to spend between $820,000 and $1.22 million to ensure that fictional television shows contain accurate health messages in their storylines. 91\"BEST INTEREST \" OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ? The CDC's new request for applications (RFA) not es the project period le ngth is five years, though continuation of awards for the entertainm ent industry liaison will be contingent on the \"availability of funds, evidence of satisfactory progress by the recipient (as documented in required reports), and the determination that cont inued funding is in the best interest of the Federal government.\"24 The RFA does not mention how awarding $700,000 for a Hollywood liaison is \"in the best interest of the Federal government.\" HOW A CDC EMPLOYEE STARTED A HOLLYWOOD LIAISON OFFICE (AND LATER BECOMES AN OFFICE GRANTEE ): CDC employee Vicki Beck \"established and was director of an entertainment education program\" at CDC \"where she conducted research and provided education and outreach to the entertainment industry.\"25 Though the program was not specif ically authorized by Congress, CDC appears to have used its broad mandate to di sseminate health messages as a justification for getting involved with Tinseltown.26 Beck's role at CDC's entertainment educati on program included \"conducting research on soap opera and prime time viewers,\" establishing an awards program for TV shows, and hosting an \"agenda-setting conference for entertainment education.\" 27 CDC PROGRAM BEGAN WITH SOAP OPERA AWARDS : While she was at CDC, Beck started \"The Sentinel for Health Award for Daytime Drama\" in 1999 to give awards to soap operas that accurately featured health themes. ABC's \"One Life to Live,\" CBS's \"The Young and The Restless\" and \"The Bold and The Beautiful\" were among the first to receive the CDC award. 28 The Award, which started in 2000 and previously went to four soap operas a year, has grown to also include the categories of prime time comedy, prime time drama, prime time minor storyline, and Spanish-language telenovela. From cruise ship sanitation to genital warts, the CDC Sentinel for Health Awards \"recognize exemplary TV storylines that best inform, e ducate and motivate viewers to make choices for healthier and safer lives.\" 29 FEDERAL HEALTH EXPERTS JUDGE T.V. SHOWS : According to the Health Awards website, CDC and NCI experts take time out of their busy days controlling, preventing, and studying diseases to judge fictitious television shows for accuracy. Finalists that survive the expert scrutiny th en move on to the second round of judging for \"entertainment value and potential benefit to the viewing audience.\"30 WHAT $1.7 MILLION TAX DOLLARS HAS BOUGHT IN HOLLYWOOD : CDC officials persuaded producers of NBC's \"E R\" to place a condom poster on the set \"as a roundabout way of getting the health message to TV viewers,\" and made sure that a bioterrorism 92scenario on Fox's \"24\" is accurate.31 CDC also makes sure th e proper federal agency is referenced in a show, trying to correct past mistakes where one show depicted NIH personnel doing tasks that would more likely have been the CDC's responsibility.32 And all these resources are provided to the entertainment indus try free of charge, courtesy of four federal health agencies spending American tax dollars. \"We've focused on being a resource for TV writers who call us all the tim e,\" Vicki Beck told one reporter. \"They've got an idea, they want, say, a certain character to suffer from a specific disease, and they need to talk to an expert on that topic to see, in fact, whether that makes sense. We then put them in touch with whomever can be st help them, whether th at person is with the CDC or UCLA or NCI or NIH, wherever.\" 33 Beck's federal funded program has worked w ith writers from \"ER,\" \"Grey's Anatomy,\" \"House,\" soap operas such as \"General Hospital,\" among others. F ROM FEDERALLY FUNDED TV TO FEDERALLY FUNDED VIDEO GAME CONSULTING ? The former CDC employee, turned CDC grant recipi ent is now looking to branch out to what she calls \"new emerging media\" such as video games, especially si nce the TV networks are putting more and more interactive t echnologies on their web sites.34 Vicki Beck told the Hollywood Reporter , \"For example, NBC curren tly has over a dozen games on its Web sites, including 'Wheelchair Challenge' on its 'ER' Web page, and we want to be a resource for the game makers, to assist them when, say, they need to know how a wheelchair needs to be used. We can put them in touch w ith the experts who the ga me developers' writers need for that sort of information.\" 35 CDC IS NOT ALONE IN FUNDING HOLLYWOOD LIAISONS : While CDC and its three collaborating agenci es (NCI, HRSA, and AHRQ) are paying for the Lear Center Hollywood liaison, federally funded forays into Hollywood do not end there. Evidently tax dollars also supported a CDC \"s moking prevention employee\" from 2002 to 2004 to try and get Hollywood movie produ cers to cut back on on-screen smoking. 36 The Department of Defense (DOD) and Departme nt of Homeland Security (DHS), the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) have all paid federal employees to outreach to Hollywood. 37 The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) hired Bobby Faye Ferguson in 2004 as DHS's \"liaison to the entertainment industry,\" a post that carried a yearly salary of over $100,000.38 She is still employed by DHS and spends an additional $10,000 a year to c over travel, expenses, and equipment/supplies.39 Ferguson previously helped fill the Hollywood liaison slot at NASA.40 The Department of Defense has an \"Air For ce Entertainment Liaison Office\" and a website entitled, \"Wings Over Hollywood.\" 41 The Department of the Army uses its public affairs office 93in Los Angeles as \"the entertainment industry's direct liaison to the United States Army.\" 42 The CIA has a \"Publications & Film Industry Liaison.\"43 COULD MEDIA AFFAIRS OFFICE MULTITASK ? No one is suggesting that CDC not answer que stions posed of it from the taxpaying public, including the taxpaying public in Hollywood. In fact, the CDC has a media relations department that fields similar questions and requests for expert interviews from members of the news media.44 The Entertainment Education Program at CD C functions to reach out to the \"media\" of entertainment. One possible solution that woul d save the taxpayers money, eliminate the need for a CDC entertainment office, and free up poten tially millions of dollars in funding, would be to have CDC's media affairs office field questio ns from the entertainment industry. If many Americans are getting some health news from fi ctional television shows, as CDC claims, then the media affairs office seems like a logical nexus. The Army, as noted above, currently uses public affairs employees to work with Hollywood \u2014 perhaps the CDC could set up a similar se rvice (without an on-location office). A ROLE BEST FILLED BY THE PRIVATE SECTOR ? It is hard to argue in this da y and age that television producers do not have an incentive, without federal taxpayer involvement, to get their storyl ines correct. Television shows that are entirely about medicine such as \"ER\" and \"House,\" for exam ple, risk losing credibility with their viewers unless they get their medicine and the health st orylines correct. Adve rtisers on those shows, including many related to the hea lth industry, serve as another la yer of built-in accountability. With the multi-billion dollar te levision industry, million-dollar-per-episode salaries for TV actors, and millions of dollars of revenue from daytime and prime-time dramas, should it be a priority for taxpayers to have CDC-funded Holly wood liaisons to help producers get the health storylines correct? If there is such an overwhelming need for a liaison to a multi-billi on dollar industry, perhaps CDC could use existing personnel whose job desc riptions already include connecting health experts with those reporting on health matters. Or, more fis cally prudent, perhaps Hollywood could fund the liaison itself. Conventional wisd om might cause taxpayers to ask, why would Hollywood pay for something if the federal government is giving it to them for free? 1 Graphic from 2007 entry form, http://l earcenter.org/pdf/S entinel07Entry.pdf , accessed April 2007. 2 2007 CDC Notice of Availability of Funds for Cooperative Agreement for the Development, Operation, and Evaluation of an Entertainment Education Program, CDC-RFA-HM07-702, http://www.cdc.gov/od/pgo/funding/HM07-702.htm , accessed May 2007. 3 Ibid. 4 Id. 5 CDC Entertainment Education website, http://www.c dc.gov/communication/entertainment_education.htm , accessed April 2007. 6 \"Public Health Expertise Brought to Entertainment Industry by USC Annenberg' s Norman Lear Center,\" USC Annenberg News , April 2, 2002, 94 http://annenberg.usc.edu/AboutUs/PublicAffairs/AbergNews/release20020402.aspx ; \"AIDS drives plots on TV,\" USA TODAY , August 7, 2007, http://www.usatoday.com/lif e/television/news/2006-08-07-aids-on-tv_x.htm ; \"A healthy approach to game development; Playing Hollywood Reporter , August 17, 2006, http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/search/a rticle_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003019257 . 7 May 11, 2007 e-mail response from CDC official in response to inquiry from Senator Tom Coburn's office. 8 Norman Lear Center website, http://www.learcenter.org/html/projects/?cm=hhs , accessed April 2007. 9 May 11, 15, 18 and 30, 2007 e-mail responses from CDC and HHS officials in response to inquiry from Senator Tom Coburn's office. 10 May 18, 2007 e-mail correspondence from HHS Legislative Affairs regarding NIH's contribution, in response to congressional inquiry from the office of Senator Tom Coburn. \"NCI support of the program has come at the end of each fiscal year, with left over resour ces being obligated for the CDC contract at the end of the fiscal year.\" NCI spent the following funds \"FY03: $300,000 for program operations and $50,000 for evaluation of outcomes; FY04: $300,000 for program operations and $50,000 for evaluation of outcomes; FY05: $250,000 for program operation and $50,000 outcomes; FY06: $250,000 for program operation; FY07 - The availability of funds for obligation to CDC [contract with th e Hollywood, Health, and Society program] is still not known. ...NCI does not know if it will have end-of-the-year funds available this year or if funds will be available in FY08.

Since Bush Administration appointee Dr. Julie L. Gerberding became the director of the CDC in 2002, the people managing the agency have seen their sh are of bonuses rise. According to the New York Times (NYT) , the top three CDC financial officers have taken in more than a quarter million dollars in bonuses over the last several years. Taxpayers have paid out $285,637 in bonuses since 2002 for the CDC's chief ope rating officer, chief financial officer, and director of finance. 1 Bonuses are as follows: $147,863 in premium bonuses (those greater than $2,500) from 2002 through the first half of 2006 for CDC's chief operating offi cer (COO), William H. Gimson III; $84,894 in bonuses from 2002 through the first half of 2006 for CDC's chie f financial officer, Barbara W. Harris; and $52,880 in premium bonuses from 2002 through early 2006 for CDC's former director of finance, John C. Tibbs. 2 CDC's COO William Gimson, bonus recipient, has st ated: \"These are one-time recognitions, and I'm proud to have received [them]. ...We are co mmitted to rewarding the outstanding achievers at CDC.\" According to a NYT analysis of CDC's financial record s, since Dr. Julie Gerberding became director of the centers in 2002, \"f inance and other management officials have received a growing share of the bonuses. The share of premium bonuses given to those within the director's office has risen at least tenfold unde r Dr. Gerberding's leadership.\"3 In 2005, the records show that officials in Dr . Gerberding's office received 60 premium bonuses totaling $515,075, or about four per cent of all bonuses granted with in the centers, compared to the $30,000 in bonuses given out in 2000 (0.4 percent of the bonuses distributed agency wide) in the office of the previous director. Before Dr. Gerberding's appointment, members of the CDC director's inner circle rarely received premium bonuses of $2,500 or more. Af ter her arrival, cash awards increased, the NYT reported. The bonuses for Mr. Gimson, the COO, which included seven cash awards, were approximately twice the amount gr anted to any other CDC employee. 4 CDC explained the bonuses as part of an Ad ministration priority to transform the CDC's management and told the New York Times , \"If we want to retain people, we need to recognize them. We are operating in a highly competitive environment.\" 5 1 \"Inner Circle Taking More of C.D.C.

In 1999, Arthur \"Jack\" Jackson retired as the CD C's chief financial officer and the head of management and operations after a 35-year career with the agency. A year after his departure, he became a CDC consultant, and since 2000, the CDC has given almost $22 million in work to two companies affiliated with Jackson, accord ing to reviews of federal documents by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution (AJC) . The CDC has hired Jackson's firms 79 times \u2014 67 times without competitive bidding \u2014 for jobs ranging from helpi ng to plan a sweeping reorganization of the agency's management to compiling five news clippings a day for top CDC executives. 2 Under a CDC program that gives contracting pref erences to small, minority-owned businesses, two firms employing Jackson (who is a white ma le) won CDC contracts. McKing Consulting Corp. (where in 2004 Jackson was a vice presid ent in charge of an Atlanta office) and Management Assistance Corp. (where he wa s a vice president from 1999 to 2002) both got contracts either without bidding or after competing only against other minority-owned firms. Lawyers for both companies told the ACJ that before they hired Jackson the firms had done little or no business with the CDC. In fact, before hiring Jackson, McKing Consulti ng had obtained only one contract from the CDC, said Joanne Zimolzak, a lawyer for the compa ny. Since the former CDC CFO came on board, CDC has awarded McKing 76 jobs, worth $14.6 million. In 66 instances, according to a database of CDC contracts reviewed by the AJC, the agency gave work to McKing without seeking competitive bids. For other work, Mc King competed with as few as three other minority-owned firms. CDC officials noted in purchasing documents that the company's 99employees \"already have a thorough understand ing of the organiza tional structure and administration\" of agency programs. McKing, the officials wrote, was \"perhaps the only available contractor.\" McKing helped the CDC update its smallpox re sponse plan, evaluated a women's health program, and provided laboratory analysts, among other jobs. The agency also hired McKing several times for communications and web design jobs. The CDC's Office of Terrorism and Preparedness Response hired Mc King to provide a consultant for \"administrative support.\" Among the consultant's required qualifications : \"knowledge of front office etiquette.\" When asked about the CDC/Jackson connect ion, Frank Rapoport, a lawyer for McKing Consulting, said \"this is not uncommon ... The revolving door is how the country seems to operate.\" When CDC officials n eed outside help, Rapoport said, \"it wouldn't surprise me if they felt more comfortable if they had someone like Mr. Jackson there.\" William Gimson, the CDC's chief operating officer, said companies connected with former CDC employees such as Jackson receive no special tr eatment. However, in an earlier interview, Gimson said, referring to Jackson: \"There's certa inly an advantage. He knows the people at CDC, and they know him. ...He would reach out to individuals he would know. Probably more so, they would reach out to him.\" About 45 minority-owned firms qualif y for contracting preferences at the CDC, Gimson said. Of the agency's 31 active co ntracts with minority businesses, McKing held 15, a government report from late 2003 indicated. In addition, 17 form er CDC employees work as consultants to CDC through contracts with Jackson's firm. Jackson was prohibited by federal law from doing business with his former agency for one year after his departure, and from working as a consu ltant on projects in which he had been directly involved as a federal official. According to CDC officials, Jackson went to some lengths to follow the law, and sought guidance on becoming a contractor for federal agencies. One former CDC ethics official noted, \"It's legal and et hical for them to come back under certain circumstances. Mr. Jackson walked a straight and narrow line.\" Records do reflect that he appears to have followed these guidelines. Before starting with McKing Consulting in 2002, Jackson worked for Management Assistance, another minority-owned business. A little over a year after he started there (which coincided with his having been retired from CDC for a little over a year), the company received its first contract from the CDC, the firs t of three it would get while employing Jackson. He \"marketed and obtained\" two of the contracts, worth about $6 million, a company lawyer told the AJC, but played no role in the third deal, worth $1.2 milli on. One of the contracts Jackson negotiated was awarded with no competitive bidding. 1 Drawing of Jack Jackson that appears on McKing Consulting website, http://mcking.com/execs.shtml , accessed March 2007. 2 All references from \"Former workers cash in at CDC: Ex -employees take 'revolving door' back to agency, where they steer millions to outside contractors,\" The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, May 19, 2004. 100CDC's Interim Ombudsmen and Former Employees Paid $250,000 to Help Build Employee Morale New Full-Time Morale Office to Cost Over $1 Million At a time of constrained budgets, growing threat s of bioterrorism and disease outbreaks, CDC decided to spend hundreds of thousands of dolla rs on outside contractors to help improve employee morale and the quality of life at CDC. It just happens that the two men hired under a temporary CDC contract are former CDC employ ees, who work for a firm founded by a former CDC official. The interim ombudsmen have reco mmended that CDC make the morale job a full- time post, a proposition that would likely cost taxpayers millions of dollars over the next decade. And the CDC wasted little time and ha s begun a search for a full-time ombudsman. On October 1, 2006, the CDC hired two former CD C managers to serve as interim ombudsmen under a one-year, $250,000 contract. 1 The interim ombudsmen, Joseph McDade and Gerald Naehr, both work for Carter Consulting, a firm founded by CDC's former Deputy Chief Operations Officer Joseph Carter 2 Their job is to serve \"as an additional resource for employees to use in addressing their workplace concerns,\" to help improve the workplace and also the \"quality of work-life at CDC.\"3 CDC employees can only contact the Atlanta-ba sed office seven hours a day, from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m., Monday through Friday. 4 According to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution (AJC), \"The idea of a CDC ombudsman came in part from discu ssions five former CDC directors had with Gerberding last spring when they raised con cerns that poor morale and an exodus of top managers were putting the agency a nd its public health mission at risk.\"5 ONE PERCENT OF CDC EMPLOYEES CONTACT OMBUDSMAN OFFICE : In a short, e-mailed report from the CDC ombuds men to all CDC employees, it was reported that from October 2006 through January 2007, the om budsmen have had a total of 26 inquiries involving 38 persons.6 They reported that of the 26 i nquiries, eight were about personnel problems (pay, promotion, or benefits); eight involved CDC policy or management systems; eight were concerns about the workplace environment; one was about office inefficiency; and one was about a technical problem. Nine of the 26 inquiries were resolved ; six were referred to other employee resources at CDC; and work on 11 inquiries was reportedly still in progress. In a March 2007 letter to Senato r Charles Grassley (R-IA), CDC Director Dr. Gerberding wrote, \"Approximately 50 persons, or less than 1 per cent of CDC employees, have contacted [the ombudsmen's] office since September 2006.\" 7 According to an April 2007 report from the om budsman's office, \"During the period from October, 2006-March 22, 2007, we had 98 visitors to the Ombudsman Office (i.e., persons who contacted us by telephone or e-mail or came to our office to discuss workplace-related problems).\" Collectively, these 98 visitors registered 89 concerns. 8 101TAXPAYERS FOOT BILL FOR PRICEY MORALE CONSULTATIONS : Out of the more than 15,000 CDC employees and c ontract workers, this contact rate amounts to taxpayers funding the ombudsman's office for approximately $2,551 per person visiting or $2,809 per complaint. The CDC ombudsman office staff also has visited ombudsman offices at the National Institutes of Health, U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and the Tennessee Valley Authority (the nation's largest public power company) \"t o understand how those offices opera te and to identify the best approaches for CDC's Ombudsman Office\" and has me t at least once with the CDC director to discuss problems and possible solutions. 9 THE GROWTH OF GOVERNMENT \u2014 CDC POSTS OPENING FOR FULL-TIME \"OMBUDS \": The interim ombudsmen recommended to the CD C director that the agency establish a permanent CDC ombudsman office with a full-time director to continue their work, and the director indicated that she pl anned to follow the suggestion. Dr. Gerberding's spokesman told the AJC , \"She's both impressed and pleased with th e work to date and is committed to moving forward with the next steps in th e creation of the ombudsman's office.\"10 On April 9, 2007, the CDC posted a job opening fo r a new, Atlanta-based CDC ombudsman to be paid at a GS-15 salary level. That salary level is between $107,800 and $140,200 per year, which amounts to $1.1-$1.4 million over the next 10 years. According to the posting, \"The incumbent will serve as an Ombuds for the CDC, and will interact with, listen to, and receive and analyze complaints, problems or questions from customers.\" 11 1 \"CDC to hire full-time ombudsman,\" The Atlanta Journal-Constitution (AJC) , January 23, 2007. 2 Carter Consulting, Inc. website, http://www.carterci.com/history.htm , accessed April 2007. 3 \"Subject: Report from CDC's Ombudsman Office, January 2007,\" e-mail from CDC Ombudsman Announcements, published by the AJC, January 23, 2007. 4 Ibid. 5 Footnote 1, op. cit. 6 Ibid.; \"Ombudsmen Program,\" e-mail from CDC Director Dr. Julie Gerberding, January 22, 2007, published by the AJC, January 23, 2007. 7 Letter from Dr. Julie Gerberding to Senator Charles Grassley dated March 5, 2007, published by the AJC, March 23, 2007, http://alt.coxnewsweb.com/ajc/pdf/cdc/gerberdingletter.pdf , accessed April 2007. 8 \"Ombudsman Quarterly Report,\" e-mailed report to a ll CDC employees from the Om budsman Office, April 4, 2007, published by the AJC, April 5, 2007. 9 Footnote 3, op. cit. 10 Supra footnote 1. 11 USAJOBS, Ombudsman GS-301-15, Open Period April 09, 2007 to Monday, April 30, 2007, http://jobsearch.usajobs.opm.gov/getjob.asp?JobID=56080704&AVSDM=2007%2D04%2D09+07%3A50%3A32& Logo=0&q=ombudsman&FedEmp=Y&sort=rv&vw=d&brd=3876&ss=0&FedPub=Y&SUBMIT1.x=0&SUBMIT1. y=0, accessed April 2007. 102HHS Secretary Uses CDC's Leased Jet for Meetings and Speeches: CDC Defends Use The CDC has a $3 million, annual lease on a 14-seat Gulfstream III jet, which costs $3,000 for every flight hour, in addition to the $252,000 a- month-cost the CDC pa ys for 24-hours-a-day, 365-days-a-year jet access. Since December 2005, th e agency has leased the jet through Phoenix Air Group, a Georgia aviation company. From January to June 2006, the Atlantic Journal- Constitution (AJC) reports that flight logs indicate the CDC had used the jet for 43 total hours, three times for emergencies and three times for training exercises, at a cost of $164,000.1 In addition to this jet, as of May 2007, CDC also has access to two other, smaller jets that remain on call in certain circumstances, su ch as dealing with stockpiles of medicines and supplies for public health emergencies. Together these two smaller jets cost $3.8 million a year for 180 flight hours, and cost $2,286 for each additional flight hour. 2 JET-SETTING HHS SECRETARY : According to an analysis of the CDC' s Gulfstream III's flight logs by the AJC, Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Michael Leavi tt used the jet for HHS business travel on 19 trips to more than 90 cities from January thr ough mid-June 2006, at an additional flight hour cost to taxpayers of $720,000.3 According to the Secretary's s pokesman, these trips fall under congressional authorization that allows the CDC to share the jet with the HHS secretary \"in times of emergencies\" and during \"significant events.\" However, according to ABC News, the law makes clear that those significant events should be \"unpr edictable\" disasters like Katrina, not scheduled meetings and speeches. 4 Secretary Leavitt's spokesman told the AJC that Secretary Leavitt used the plane to visit places around the country to help millions of senior ci tizens sign up for the new Medicare Part D drug benefit, to personally assess some of the early problems with the program, to help mobilize the country in its preparations for a possible influenza pandemic, and to travel to New Orleans to help the city rebuild its health care infrastructure. 5 Secretary Leavitt defended his use of the jet sa ying he makes use of it only when commercial travel is too slow to meet his schedule. \"Actually, there's nothi ng political about this,\" he told ABC News. \"This is carrying out the business of the Depart ment of Health and Human Services.\"6 103 On two occasions in 2006, the CDC needed the jet for medical emergencies, but Secretary Leavitt was using it so the CDC had to hire another jet at additional taxpayer expense.7 CDC CALLS SECRETARY 'S JET TRAVELS \"CRITICALLY IMPORTANT \": According to \"talking points\" from the CD C's communication direct or, e-mailed out the morning the original ACJ article appeared, \"It is absolutely imperative that CDC have access to these planes. These planes directly support our mission to be able to mobilize people and supplies on a moment's notice to protect our nation' s health.

CONGRESSIONAL EFFORTS TO RESTRICT USE FAIL: Language was inserted in the Senate version of the fiscal year 2007 HHS funding bill to restrict CDC aircraft travel \"for emergency use only,\" but the restriction language ultimately was dropped out of the bill passed in January 2007 by the new 110th Congress.10 1; \"Cabinet official is primary user (AJC) , June photo from CDC website, www.cdc.gov . 2 \"CDC rarely uses costly leased jets,\" AJC, May 28, 2007. 3 Footnote 1, Cabinet official, op. cit 4 \"HHS Secretary's Use of CDC Jet Cost Taxpayers $720 ,000: Michael Leavitt Authorized to Use Private Plane Only in Emergencies, Not for Political Business\" ABC News , June 17, 2006, http://abcnews.go.com/WNT/story?id=2085927 . 5 Supra footnote 1. 6 Footnote 4, op. cit. 7 Ibid. 8 E-mail from Donna M.

Research has demonstrated time and time again that drinking alcohol, especially in excess, is considered a risk factor for spreading sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), such as HIV. Alcohol has been shown to decrease a person's inhibitions, which in turn may lead to risky behavior, including risky sexual behavior. Unfortunately, in the case of one San Franci sco HIV prevention group, its risqu\u00e9 approach trumped sound public policy and taxpay ers were left footing the bill. CDC-F UNDED MAGAZINE DETAILS HOW TO THROW A HOUSE PARTY : The CDC-funded STOP AIDS Pr oject (SAP) of San Francisc o received nearly $700,000 a year in federal HIV prevention funds from the CDC. SAP published a Winter 1999/2000 resource magazine for black gay and bisexual men of the San Francisco Bay area entitled \"Our Love.\" The magazine, which states that it was funded \"with a gr ant from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,\" includes an article entitled \"Party at BJ's,\" which explains how to have a \"house part y\" and how much alcohol to serve.1 THE PARTY AT BJ' S ARTICLE EXPLAINS HOW ALCOHOL HELPS A HOUSE PARTY : \"The Drinks \"One more thing. It may not be a necess ity but it sure help s. And that is alcohol. You don't have to go broke trying to get enough booze for the whole creation to drink, but a selection is a must. Since you have invited people from all of your social circles, you know there will be wine-heads, the beer-nuts, the cocktail lushes, and a few fo lks who simply don't touch the stuff. And everyone should have a cup in their hand of something that will hit the spot. Here's what to do. And you may l ook like a suicidal drunk in the line at the grocery store, but go and buy a little bit of every kind of drink. At least two kinds of wine, red and white. Get at least two kinds of liquors, dark and light (rum and vodka). Have a few beer s in the fridge, maybe a 12 pack or two. Have enough juice and soft drinks to use as mixers and to drink straight. And splurge with a little gr enadine and some lime. It doesn't have to be a full bar, but keep smiles on the peoples faces with selection.\" 105TARGET AUDIENCE HAS HIGH PERCENTAGE OF HIV INFECTION : A May 2001 CDC study of men who have sex with men (MSM) in six major U.S. cities found that nearly one in every thr ee gay or bisexual African American men is HIV-positive, and prevalence rates in this population continue to climb.2 In addition, in 2005, black gay men still represented over 30 percent of the new HIV/AIDS cases among gay men and over 50 percent of the new cases are young adults.3 YET CDC FUNDING WAS USED TO ENCOURAGE USE OF ALCOHOL , A KNOWN HIV RISK FACTOR : According to CDC's own studies and resources, alcohol in creases the risk for HIV. \"The use of alcohol and illegal drugs c ontinues to be prevalent among some MSM and is linked to risk factors for HIV inf ection and other STDs. Substance use can increase the risk for HIV transmission through the tendency toward risky sexual behaviors while under the influence and th rough sharing needles or other injection equipment. ...[Methamphetamines and othe r \"party\" drugs] along with alcohol and nitrate inhalants (\"poppers\"), have been associated with risky sexual practices among MSM.\"4 So the STOP AIDS Project targ eted a high-risk, high-rate-of- infection population with an article on how to throw an alcohol party ... and it was done using CDC's HIV prevention funds. If the target audience followed the CD C-subsidized instructi ons and hosted a booze party that led to risky sexual behavior, it is possible that mo re HIV infections could have been the result. BAR NIGHT FOR HIV+ MEN: Two years later, the same CDC-funded gr oup hosted a \"Bar Night\" at Club Rendezvous advertised as \"A social event with other HIV+ men.\" According to the invite, \"Non- alcoholic drinks and bar nuts provided. Mixe d drinks, beer, and wi ne are available for purchase. Come find out what question is on everyone's mind!\"5 To recap: a group that receives federal funds sp ends money to target not only a high-risk population, but one actually carry ing the communicable disease HIV, and hosts the targeted event at a bar with alcohol, a known risk factor for spreading HIV. 1 Winter 1999/2000 STOP AIDS resource magazine for black gay and bisexual men of the San Francisco Bay area entitled \"Our Love,\" page 5. 2 \"Assessing the Impact of HIV/AIDS on African Americans, News and Features,\" AmfAR AIDS research, March 21, 2002, http://www.amfar.org/cgi -bin/iowa/news/record.html?record=58 , accessed December 2006. 3 \"Tracking AIDS,\" a PBS NewsHour with Jim Lehrer, June 15, 2005, http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/health/jan-june05/aids_6-15.html , accessed December 2006. 4 CDC website, http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/to pics/msm/resources/factsheets/msm.htm , accessed January 2007. 5 \"PF Bar Night Polk,\" Tuesday, May 7, 2002, sponsored by the STOP AIDS Project, http://www.stopaids.org/mod.php?mod= calendar&op=show_event&event_id=119 , accessed May 2002. 106CDC Sets Bioterrorism Results-Oriented Goals After Spending Billions While L.A. spends CDC grant money on gift bags, Hollywood actors, Santa Claus books, and a pool safety video ... 1 In the post 9/11 environment, Congress has significantly increased funding for homeland security threats such as bioterrorism. As political observers have noted, Members of Congress tend to fight over how this fundi ng gets distributed with nearly everyone claiming his or her state or district as a po ssible target for terrorism. The bioterrorism grants distributed to states through CDC have b ecame part of this political in-fighting, as Congress directed CDC to dole out the taxpaye rs' money across all 50 states, and directly to four metropolitan cities. Even though CD C was required to spread the grant money across the country, CDC does not appear to have developed an adequate system of measuring how states were spending the funding and whether or not states were prepared for bioterrorist attacks after spending the billions of taxpayers' dollars sent their way. In 2004, the CDC distributed $849.6 million for biot errorism preparedness grants, part of $1.3 billion Congress approved that year for states, territories, and four metropolitan areas: Los Angeles County, Chicago, New York City, and Washington, D.C. 2 It was the third installment since Congr ess increased public health preparedness grants following the terrorist attacks and an thrax mailings of 2001. According to the HHS Inspector General (IG), bioterrorism funding began in 1999, but CD C funding for bioterrorism preparedness increased 1,276 percent from $66.7 million in fiscal year 2001 to $918 million in FY2002.3 From August 1999 until 2004, CDC allocated over $2 billion to 50 states and 12 localities in bioterrorism preparedness grants.4 L.A. COUNTY SPENDS $2 MILLION IN CDC BIOTERRORISM FUNDS ON QUESTIONABLE EXPENSES ; CDC SAYS IT DOESN 'T HAVE TIME TO SCRUTINIZE GRANTS : 5 Over a two year period, from 2002 to 2004, th e CDC released more than $2.7 billion nationwide in bioterrorism grants, with Los Angeles County receiving $83 million \u2014 $14 107million of which went unspent. In 2006, the county was given an additional $27.9 million.6 Spending every federal dollar received, and not necessarily spending it wisely, appeared to be the goal of L.A. County in 2003. Th e county's bioterrorism preparedness director, according to a report in the L.A. Times , told her staff in May 2003 about a meeting to \"emphasize the importance\" of spending all th e grant money given to the county. \"We have repeatedly assured Dr. Fi elding [the county's public heal th director], and the Board [of Supervisors], that we will not forgo any of this money,\" Grigsby wrote. \"Please be able to demonstrate how we can make this happen.\" 7 And make it happen they did. An L.A. Times review found that L.A. County spent more than $2 million of its CDC bioterrorism grant money for questionable purchases of services and supplies unrelated to bioterrori sm, and found that \"at times, the spending has stretched the definition of terrorism readiness.8 The county used CDC bioterrorism funds to hire Hollywood actors to play patients in a half-day smallpox vaccination drill in 2004. The tab for taxpayers: $57,045 for the firm to hire the actors, $10,000 for gift certificates, $13,600 for pens, digital thermometers and bags to hold the gifts, and thousands more for food and transportation. 9 The county's public health director told the L.A. Times it was much cheaper to use paid actors than county employees. L.A. County also spent more than $128,000 in CDC bioterro rism funds \"for tchotchkes [trinkets] to be given away to the public, including letter openers, whistles, magnets, mouse pads, flashlights, pens , travel toothbrushes and emer gency kits. The department spent $1,000 on nylon discs for Public Health Week, emblazoned with the slogan 'Nutrition and Physical Activity: Keys to Health.' And it spent $4,145 on clipboards, notepads and stress balls to give away at a forensic epidemiology conference.\" 10 Some other expenditures funded by CDC's bioterrorism grants to L.A. County include: \"At least $170,000 to train department staff on how to put together videos to be viewed online. Two videos have been pr oduced: one on the role of public health, the other on home pool safety.11 \"A $4,675 teleprompter so that Fielding and others can 'face the camera and be able to read a prepared speech,' plus nearly $450 in upgrades to the teleprompter, $2,187 for a laptop to write scripts for the te leprompter and $3,392 for a 'very special portable microphone for excellent quality remo te interviews and scene descriptions,' according to the expense reports. Hundreds more went to replace a podium that had been 'damaged by rodents.' \"More than 70 high-end desk chairs at about $600 each and about 800 computers, although only 171 staff members are funded by the bioterrorism grant.\" [The County's public health director told the L.A. Times the computers are used by public health employees who may be need ed to respond to a disaster.] 108 \"$4,629 for printer cartridges because of an 'i ncreased amount of bite reports' related to West Nile. \"Assorted inexpensive but puzzling items such as motivational posters, a $46 mahogany tape dispenser and four copies of the book 'The Leadership Secrets of Santa Claus.'\" 12 [Note: The Santa book begins, \"Believe you me, having to smile and be jolly everyday when you're wearing the same thick, hot, red-wool suit (that itches like crazy) is no picnic.\" 13] P REPAREDNESS EQUALS DISTRIBUTING TOKEN GIFTS WITH EMERGENCY CONTACT INFORMATION : The director of the UCLA Center for Public Health and Disasters, which has received hundreds of thousands of dollars from the c ounty to conduct training exercises, told the L.A. Times , \"The county is better prepared than most counties in the United States to handle a large-scale public health emergency\" and that some of the questionable expenses are indeed related to emergency preparedness. He said the trinkets, for instance, have the health department's contact information or we b address, so they could be useful in an emergency.14 CDC DOESN 'T \"HAVE THE TIME\" TO DETECT WASTE : According to the L.A. Times , \"The CDC does not have the time to scrutinize every expense, [director of CDC's division of state and local readiness Alison] Johnson and [senior CDC official Donna] Knutson said. The agency expects grant recipients to commission outside audits.\"15 CDC REFOCUSES FUNDING GOALS TO MEASURE OUTCOME IN 2005: Though CDC bioterrorism funding began in 1999 and increased ove r 1,000 percent in 2002, it was not until 2005 that CDC announced a new results-oriented focus that would measure how states and localities were meeting bioterrorism goals. Previously, CDC funding guidelines focused on activities planned or areas reached, a measurement method one grantee describe d as asking, \"How many meetings did you have?\" 16 According to a 2004 Office of Management and Budget (OMB) review of CDC's bioterrorism grant program, CDC funding was not tied to accomplishment of annual and long-term performance goals. OMB reported that in 2004 the CDC was still working to establish \"outcome oriented goals and targets for preparedness.\" The review did note that congressional requirements to distribute th e funds to all the stat es and locations took 109some accountability measures out of CDC's ha nds: \"since states determine allocation of total funding, CDC can not ti e funding levels to achievement of specific goals.\"17 In May of 2005, when announcing $862.8 million in bioterrorism grant funding, the CDC announced it was switching to a focus on \"preparedness goals or measurements.\" 18 The CDC confirmed the goals were new: \"The preparedness goals or measurements \u2014 that is a new piece to the cooperative agreement,\" CDC spokesman Von Roebuck told one news outlet. \"They have not been in there before. They do build a bit up on the past recommendations as far as key points that we wanted to have covered. They actually are a work in progress.\" 19 The Atlanta Journal-Constitution (AJC) also made note of the new agency requirements, \"[In 2005], the CDC began asking states for information that shows how well they could perform in case of a bioterrorism attack\" (emphasis added).20 The new goals fall under the headings \"Preve nt, Detect/Report, I nvestigate, Control, Recover, and Improve\" and outline particul ar outcomes, tasks, and measures of performance required by grantees under each goal. 21 When determining whether or not they are meeting the goal of detecting and re porting dangerous agents in tissue, food, or environmental samples, for example, grantees are now required to measure their ability to send a sample potentially containing an infectious agent to a reference laboratory within 60 minutes of the sample collection. The CDC's measurement goals now call for spee ding up the identification of causes, risk factors, and appropriate interv entions for threats to public he alth, such as being able to start an epidemiologic investigation within th ree hours after an unusua l pattern of disease cases is detected. 22 \"We're very pleased to see the switch\" in approach, Aggie Leitheiser, assistant commissioner for the Health Protection Bureau in the Minnesota Department of Health, told one news outlet. \"Rathe r than 'How many meetings did you have?' [the CDC is asking], 'Can you show you're able to act effectively?'\"23 According to news reports, the Senate Finance Committee was working with a CDC whistleblower in the spring of 2006 to determ ine whether \"taxpayers have gotten their money's worth\" from the $3.8 billion grant pr ogram for states to bolster public health preparedness in case of a bi oterrorist attack. The whis tleblower reportedly expressed concern about whether the grants were being us ed effectively. That investigation follows on the heels of reports from the HHS IG raisi ng concerns about the suitability of some purchases and questioning why some of the biot errorism funding went unspent. Some IG reports have found that bioterrorism funding wa s inappropriately used to pay for general expenses affected by local budget cuts, the AJC reports. 24 BILLIONS SPENT ON PREPAREDNESS , BUT CDC SAYS IT DOESN 'T NECESSARILY KNOW HOW TO MEASURE IT: A full six years after bioterrorism funding began, the director of CDC's Coordinating Office for Terrorism Preparedness and Emergency Responses told the AJC that CDC still is trying to figure out \"how to quantify preparedness.\"25 110After billions of tax dollars were spen t funding preparedness gr ants, it would seem taxpayers could expect that CDC, the agency in charge of dispensing these funds, would have progressed beyond grappling about what it means to be prepared. 1 A microscopic view of the anthrax bacteria, Washington Post image from Fort Detrick, Maryland, http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/nation/specials/attacked/bioterrorism/ , accessed March 2007. 2 \"HHS Awards $849 Million to Improve Public Health Preparedness,\" HHS press release, dated June 17, 2004, http://www.hhs.gov/news/press/2004pres/20040617.html , accessed March 2007. 3 \"State and Local Bioterrorism Preparedness,\" HH S Inspector 2002, OEI-02- 01-00550, http://oig.hhs.gov/oei/reports/oei-02-01-00550.pdf . 4 \"Nationwide Audit of State and Local Government Ef forts to Record and Monitor Subrecipients' Use of Public Health Preparedness and Response for Bioterrorism Funds,\" HHS Inspector General Report, August 2004, A-05-04-00027, http://oig.hhs.gov/oas/reports/region5/50400027.pdf ; According to the IG report, CDC bioterrorism preparedness funding equaled: $40 million for FY2000, for FY2002-FY2003, and $1.016 billion for FY2004. 5 County of Los Angeles Public Health Emergency Preparedness and Response website graphic, http://www.labt.org/ . 6 \"County aims anti-terrorism cash at some unusual targets,\" Los Angeles Times , March 6, 2006. 7 Ibid. 8 Id. 9 Id. 10 Id. 11 The County has a pool safety video online, last updated in May of 2006, which may be the video referred to in the L.A.

RECOMMENDATIONS \"An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cu re,\" or so the adage goes. Prevention, measured in health care terms, is worth tr illions of dollars saved in medical costs, increased productivity, improved quality of life, and added years of healthy living. Over the last century, for example, the average U. S. lifespan has increased by more than 30 years, with 25 of these added years attributed to prevention.1 Billions of dollars are spent every year on prevention and health promotion by the federal government, but the cost of care for preventabl e conditions is growing. Federal efforts to prevent disease sometimes are hampered by pr ograms designed to spend taxpayer funds, but lacking methods to measure success and re quire results as a condition for receiving federal funding, and also by duplicative and overlapping prevention efforts among numerous federal departments and agencies. With its mission of preventing and control ling disease, the CDC stands in a unique position to positively affect the lives of millions of Americans. W HY CONSTANT CALLS TO INCREASE CDC FUNDING MISS THE MARK: Calls from CDC supporters, and, not surprisi ngly, CDC grantees, to increase CDC's funding year after year, ignore the fact th at CDC should undergo a reevaluation and a reprioritization process before the American taxpayers continue to increase its budget.2 The Campaign for Public Health, for example, seeks to increase the CDC's budget to $15 billion by 2012, which would add approxima tely $5 billion to the agency's FY2007 funding. The campaign seeks to advance effo rts \"in support of a le vel of funding that will enable the CDC to fulfill its mission 't o protect health and quality of life by preventing and controlling diseas e, injury and disability.'\" 3 The Campaign is built on the premise that more money is required for CDC to fulfill its mission, though nowhere does the campaign or its supporters call for an ex amination of current funding to see if funding is even the problem, or the onl y solution to the problem. Not surprisingly, the Campaign's website does not mention the fact that 21 of the 40 groups on its advisory council s upporting the effort to incr ease CDC funds actually get CDC funding themselves. Over the last five years, these 21 advisory groups have received over $300 million from the CDC. 4 In March 2007, the Campaign for Public He alth launched a D.C. media market ad campaign that had the tag line: \"Prot ect the CDC and In crease Its Budget.\" 5 The ad was signed by 21 organizations, 12 of which coll ectively received over $60 million in the last five years from the CDC.6 112It is not hard to s ee why organizations, even non-profit organizations, that receive money from an agency would have a self-interes t in promoting additional funding for that agency. While many of the groups in this campai gn, and others advocating funding increases, have altruistic motives to help those afflicted with some pa rticular disease, they overlook the possibility that reprogramming hundreds of millions of questionably targeted dollars (from conferences, for example), could go a long way toward meeting disease-specific funding goals. As this \"CDC Off Center\" report demonstr ates, hundreds of millions of tax dollars are used for questionable purposes with often unknown or immeasurable results. G ETTING CDC BACK ON TRACK : CDC should get back on track toward accountab ility and responsible disease control by implementing the following six recommendations: CDC (and the politicians that fund it) should require the re views of existing programs, the consolidation of overla pping programs, and the elimination of ineffective programs. CDC should reprioritize its funding and efforts toward preventing and controlling diseases. Period. Prevention programs should be science-ba sed, subject to rigorous audits and reviews, and continued funding should be tied to measurable outcomes. CDC programs and grantees should not promote or support unhealthy or risky behaviors, and those that do so should be defunded. CDC preparedness programs should include re gular drills and tests to assess and correct weaknesses in planning or execu tion and allow for a reprogramming or reprioritizati on of funding. CDC should reexamine the profligate spe nding in its own backyard. Creating a theme-park-like campus in Atlanta, with Japanese gardens, a wall full of plasma screen televisions showing vignettes to visitors, and installing employee saunas and mood-enhancing light shows, strays from CDC's mission to be good stewards of limited taxpayer dollars. 1\"Guide to Smart Prevention Investments,\" Partnership for Prevention, Fall 2001. http://prevent.org/images /stories/Files/publications/Invest_Final.pdf, accessed March 2007. 2\"Background: Mission and History, The Campaign for Public Health,\" http://www.fundcdc.org/cph_bkgd_main.htm , accessed March 2007. 3Ibid. 113 4 May 18, 2007 e-mail from CDC to Senator Tom Coburn's office in response to congressional inquiry.

CONCLUSION The Centers for Disease Control is one of the few government agencies that has been demonstrated to engender trust and confid ence among the American public. People are content to believe that those employed at the CDC are watching out for American citizens, whether or not it is respond ing to and tracking down the causes of E. coli outbreaks, preparing for bioterro rism attacks, or working to fight and prevent disease in America. \"CDC Off Center\" is not an effort to disc redit the good work that the CDC and those who work for it have carried out and the good work that will continue in the future. The report will hopefully be seen for what it is: an effort to shine some light on prevention efforts and funding decisions that may be hol ding the agency back from fulfilling its central mission of fighting and controlling disease. In 2007, the CDC has an estimated budget of $10 billion and a mission \"To promote health and quality of life by preventing and controlling diseas e, injury, and disabili ty.\" The funding level and the mission are, by most standards, substantial. This review of recent CDC expenditures dem onstrates that a reprioritization of CDC funding and a review of the appr oach to certain types of dis ease prevention are in order. The CDC says it \"pledges to the American peopl e: To be a diligent steward of the funds entrusted to it [...and to] place th e benefits to society above th e benefits to the institution.\" 1 If this pledge is to be more than mere sentiment, the CDC should commence a bottom-up and top-down review of how the agency is spendi ng the taxpayers' hard-earned money and should institute agency-wide and programmatic reforms where needed. It is hoped that this report and the recommenda tions contained within it will assist CDC in identifying areas to look first for that reform. 1CDC website, http://www.cdc.gov/about/mission.htm , http://www.cdc.gov/fmo/PDFs/FY06AppropFactsheet.pdf , accessed October 2006. 115APPENDIX CONTROL AND PREVENTION CDC HIV/AIDS PREVENTION1 FY 2001-2008 (Dollars in Thousands) Budget Activity FY 2001 Actual FY 2002 Actual FY 2003 Actual FY 2004 Actual FY 2005 Actual FY 2006 Actual FY 2007 Enacted11 FY Budget HIV, Viral Hepatitis, STD, $84,069 $72,972 Global $815,000+ by CDC and the Congressional Research Service (CRS), except where noted. 2According to CDC, from FY2003 to FY2004, funding for the Division of AIDS, STD, and TB Laboratory Re search was reallocated to v arious other areas within the CDC budget from the Infectious Diseases Contro l budget activity.

Funding in FY2006 is shown comparably. 6 Includes funds for School Health - HIV/AIDS, Safe Motherhood - HIV/AIDS, Oral Health - HIV/AIDS, and BRFSS - HIV/AIDS. 7 Because funding for the Birth Defects, Developmental Disabiliti es, Disability and Health accounts and the Infectious Disease Co ntrol account were reallocated within the CDC budget during the time period shown (as indicated by the dashes), this subtotal does not provid e a true reflection of the CDC's HIV/AIDS budget. 8These figures are taken from \"Trends in U.S. Global AI DS Spending: FY2000-FY2007,\" CRS, December 26, 2006, RL33771. 9Funding shown for the President's International Mother and Child HIV Prevention Initiative in FY2003 and 2004 is not counted in the subtotals or totals because PMTCT was transferred from CDC to the Departme nt of State's Office of the Globa l AIDS Coordinator (OGAC) in F Y 2005. Funding figures from Public Laws 108-7 and 108-199. 10CDC does not \"count\" in its HIV/AIDS budget those funds received from the OGAC, yet amounts shown are spent by CDC on HIV/AIDS prevention. According to CDC, additional funds are \"likely to be transferred\" in FY07 from OGAC (though the amount is not yet k nown), and an estimate for the FY08 transfer is not yet available. aThese totals do not include PMTCT f unds because they were only temporarily counted in CDC's budget. 11\"FY2007 Joint Resolution [CDC] Detail Table,\" http ://www.cdc.gov/fmo/PDFs/F Y_2007_JR_Detail_Table.pdf , accessed May 2007.
