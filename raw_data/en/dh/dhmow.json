Therefore, it is considered the most common mental disorder in modern society, presenting with symptoms such as nervousness, worry, or discomfort [1-3]. In excess, this problem can decrease the efficiency of the immune system, affecting the body's homeo - stasis and, consequently, exposing it to other diseases [3]. Anxiety can be related to depression, stress, and panic syndrome, among other emotional issues. These problems can have different origins, and their causes must be known to address them. Therefore, there are different therapies to reduce and prevent this disease, includ ing conventional drug therapy homeopathy, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), herbal medicine, and psychotherapy. Therefore, the present review aims to highlight the effectiveness of each of these treatments in providing physical, mental, and social well-being [4,5]. Clinical Features and Diagnoses Anxiety disorders include several different symptoms, such as: panic disorder, social and specific phobias, obsessive-compulsive disorders (OCD), post-traumatic stress, and generalized anxiety which is one of the most common and frequently seen [4-6].

This disorder manifests with a variety of symptoms, which can cause professional instability, clinical changes, and anti-social behavior. Actually, several forms of treatment are available, such as modern medicine, with the main use of antidepressants; homeopathy, an approach that treats the patient as a whole, in mental, physical, and social aspects; cognitive behavioral therapy, which treats anxiety by focusing on the individual's current problems; phyto therapy, which involves treatment of the disease using medicinal plants and psychotherapy methods. However, all of these treatments may have complications, presenting contradictory responses to what was expected. Thus, the choice of the best therapy is crucial in the management of anxiety to ensure less response time to treatment and with less physical and mental consequences for the patient.

Alternative Therapies for the Treatment of Anxiety. On J Complement & Alt Med. 4(2): 2020. OJCAM.MS.ID.000584. DOI: 10.33552/OJCAM.2020.04.000587 .Page 2 of 2ders (DSM-V), the characteristics of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) are excessive concerns for expectations created, which result in professional instability, clinical changes and social manifesta - tions. The frequency, intensity, and duration are not proportional to the impact, and there is difficulty in controlling this concern [1,3-6]. Thus, for the diagnostic criterion, three of the following symptoms: restlessness or feeling of nerves on edge, fatigue, muscle tension, sleep imbalance, irritability, and problems with concentration, need to be present for at-least six months. However, in children, only one of these symptoms is required for diagnosis. In some cas - es, there may be somatic physical effects such as sweating, tachy - cardia, palpitation, dyspnea, headache, etc., which may be related to panic disorder and stress [3-5]. Treatment Conventional drug treatments for anxiety include antidepres - sants (e.g. Buspirone) and anxiolytics like benzodiazepines which are commonly used because they have an immediate onset of ther - apeutic effect. These drugs cause effects such as sedation, hypnosis, decreased anxiety, and muscle relaxation [2,3]. The treatment through homeopathy is based on four princi - ples: the law of similars, experimentation in healthy men, minimal and dynamic doses, and the unique remedy. According to these laws, there are substances that have the potential to cure the same symptoms that they themselves are also capable of producing. The amount of these components is not of paramount importance, but the more agitated and diluted they are, greater the potential for healing energy they have. This therapy plays a role in treating the patient as a whole, in its mental, physical, and social aspects; and acts on the patient's body to strengthen and react to these symp - toms. For this reason, homeopathic treatment is an effective means of restoring health, since it uses the body's own ability to stimulate its vital energy and find balance [7-9]. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is based on a cognitive model of observing an individual's behavior and emotions, and stating that such attitudes are determined by the way the individu - al sees the world. This approach is very effective in treating anxiety by focusing on the patient's current problems and seeking to solve them through relaxation, sleep hygiene, and time management. Thus, CBT interferes with the cognitive model, seeking to contin - uously correct distorted beliefs, in the short-term, and aiming to help the patient in the control and stabilization of their thoughts [6,10,11]. Phytotherapy consists of the use of medicinal plants for the prevention and treatment of diseases. Among them, Passiflora In - carnate is widely used in the treatment of anxiety. It acts as a non - specific depressant of the central nervous system (CNS), in addition to its efficiency in reducing insomnia. The active ingredient or the portion with the therapeutic purpose of the plant is located in its leaves and stems. It is recommended to ingest these parts in a mix - ture, with one to two grams per 150 mL of boiling water 1 to 4 times a day. Another plant used to treat the disease is Valeriana officinalis , found in the temperate zones of the northern hemisphere, Africa, and South America. It has a calming, sleep inducing, and anxiolytic activity, in addition to increasing the concentration of GABA, which is an inhibitory neurotransmitter in the CNS, thus, it slows down brain activity and subsequently leaves the individual calmer [12]. Psychotherapy refers to a method of psychological treatment, exercised by a trained professional, which has the objective of influ - encing the patient and assisting him in his difficulties and suffering, which can be of cognitive, behavioral, or emotional. The goal of psy - choanalytic treatment is to make conscious the unconscious, with theoretical and technical concepts, and to promote the reconstruc - tion of the personality structure with resolution of basic conflicts that the anxious patient carries with him and that, with the help of a professional, has a greater chance of being elucidated [11]. Complications Modern medicine consists of the use of conventional drugs, industrially produced on a large scale or manipulated in pharma - cies when necessary, which can have several side effects and toxic - ities. Anxiety treatment based on this method can cause addiction, drowsiness, and vertigo, among other symptoms [2,3]. Complications through homeopathic treatment are minimal. However, worsening of primary symptoms may occur with incor - rect doses in excess of the recommendations. In addition, if the pa - tient complains of new symptoms during treatment, the use should be discontinued. On the other hand, even if initial therapy is consid - ered complete, there is a possibility that the symptoms will recur over time [9]. With cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), there may be compli - cations to reach the expected goals, due to the central beliefs, which most patients treat as absolute truths, and are difficult to correct [6]. With CBT as well as psychotherapy, adverse effects such as new symptoms, anguish, and tensions in family relationships are possi - ble. In addition, there are examples of more serious symptoms due to prolonged treatment or the use of incorrect methods, such as suicidal ideation, feelings of shame and guilt, intensive crying and emotional disturbances [13]. However, in both therapies, non-iden - tification by the methods and discontinuation of therapy is a fre - quent challenge [14]. Herbal treatment, if used in excess doses and for a long period, may have side effects such as nausea, headache, and vertigo among others, which disappear after suspension of therapy [12,15]. In addition, some medications cannot be consumed by pregnant pa - tients and by patients who are using other medications [12]. Other noticeable adverse symptoms are mild abdominal distension, acid regurgitation, and drowsiness [15]. Conclusion It is well known that anxiety can negatively affect the daily lives of individuals as well as hamper the effectiveness of the immune Citation: Mayra Fernandes Martins, Eriston Vieira Gomes, Laura Gomes Lima etc all...,.

There are several types of anxiety symptoms, with different characteristics expressed in different ways and intensities, unique to each individual. Therefore, various forms of treatment are neces - sary to reduce the effects caused by anxiety, such as modern medi - cine, homeopathic, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), herbal med -icine, and psychotherapy, (Figure 1). Consequently, the use of these methods can lead to complications and even worsen symptoms if they are used improperly. Thus, the correct approach is necessary for the effective treatment of this common and widespread disease.
