Meantime, see if this is useful for you. Holistic Veterinarian Resources Raising truly healthy Vital Animals takes learning wise choices. Let a veterinary insider guide you. Vital Animal Courses Now, more than ever, you need to make smart choices in how you rear your animals. You can no longer afford to just hand over your health care choices blindly to Dr. White Coat, the conventional vet. That's a recipe for man-made disease, heartbreak, and great expense. I'm here to empower you with knowledge, stretch your boundaries of thinking, and give your animals the most remarkably healthy lives they can have. I do that best with online courses. To be sure you don't miss these often limited time opportunities to enroll, be sure to sign up to [get first notice here](https://vitalanimal.com/vital-animal-courses/). How about this to get you started: [Rabies Short Course](https://vitalanimal.com/rabies-short-course/) (free) Raw Food Question: what could compare to raw wild game (deer and elk) made into dog food?

Wysong You'd have a hard time finding fault with the foods and treats coming from Dr. Randy Wysong's company in Midland, Michigan. He's been dedicated to great products and sound ideas for many years, and I cut my nutrition teeth on some of his writings. This just may be the \"sleeper\" food in the pet food world: so good it should be in every pet dish, but many haven't discovered it yet. Lots of cool products in wise packaging to keep the good in and the bad out. Not a Johnny come lately, Dr. Wysong's foods have served multiple generations of animals with great health benefits, and have weathered a large number of fads, the latest being \"grain free.\" If you're really thinking, you'll see \"starch free\" is what we're after for our carnivores, and Wysong has the first truly starch-free kibble out there, called [Epigen](https://vitalanimal.com/va/wysong-choices/). Do try them, and see which of his many foods I recommend by clicking on that happy girl and her best bud. And remember: Change it UP! (i.e. variety is important! Change foods monthly or so.)

[Eat Wild!](http://www.eatwild.com/index.html) World Class Supplements When you realize the food you feed is nutrient limited and can often be toxic (thanks, Bayer, your RoundUp is now showing up in 98% of Americans!), you'll want to supplement what you feed with some top quality products. Our sister company, [Venjenz](https://venjenz.com/?ref=drfalconer) began (originally as Vital Pet Health) when we realized the supplement world was bereft of all-natural supplements that actually DO something valuable for those innocents in your care. We began with two main products: [Rampart](https://venjenz.com/rampart-k9/?ref=drfalconer), to strengthen your animal's immune system to function as Nature intended it, to protect against challenges and stand down in balanced alertness when the threat has been neutralized.
