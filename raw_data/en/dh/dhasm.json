The company announced the year-over-year revenue spike ahead of its fourth quarter earnings report, which will come out Feb. 21. It also boosted full-year revenue expectations for 2018 but maintained fairly conservative guidance for 2019, according to Wall Street analysts. Still, the company's shares surged nearly 12 percent over the past two days on the news. They closed Tuesday at $131.52 on the Nasdaq exchange. \"Our success in 2018 was driven by increasing awareness of the importance of continuous glucose monitoring in managing diabetes, supported by the approval and launch of Dexcom's G6 Continuous Glucose Monitoring platform in the U.S. and internationally,\" said Kevin Sayer, Dexcom's chief executive. The revenue gain came despite increased competition in the continuous glucose monitoring market, with Abbott Laboratories FreeStyle Libre monitor launching in the U.S. in late 2017, and Medtronic also rolling out new glucose monitors. Dexcom executives have argued that the market for wearable glucose monitors is new, so the additional competitors would help raise awareness. That appears to be the case so far, said Baird Equity Research Analyst Jeff Johnson. \"It seems increasingly obvious that FreeStyle Libre is, indeed, helping to expand the overall continuous glucose monitoring market,\" said Johnson. \"Dexcom is one of the clear benefactors, along with Abbott, of this strong market demand.\" Dexcom said Monday that fourth quarter revenue will top $331 million. Wall Street analysts had been expecting sales of $284 million. For its full 2018 fiscal year, Dexcom said revenue is expected to reach $1.025 billion, up 42 percent from a year earlier. The company previously forecast annual revenue of $925 million. \"The fourth quarter was unequivocally a strong finish to the year, with Dexcom delivering record new patient additions and robust global revenue growth,\" said Kyle Rose, an analyst with Canaccord Genuity. \"Looking forward, Dexcom remains in the early stages of rolling out the G6 and continues to drive patient awareness with direct-to-consumer investments, which we expect will support robust new patient additions through year-end,\" said Rose in a research report. Wearable continuous glucose monitoring devices place a sensor just under the skin to alert people with diabetes when their blood sugar is too low or two high. To date, these devices have been mostly used by people with Type 1 diabetes, where spikes or falls in blood sugar levels can result in serious medical complications. The monitors are generally covered by insurance for Type 1 diabetics. About 2 million people in the U.S. and roughly 40 million worldwide have Type 1 diabetes. Of those, only about a quarter in the U.S. use continuous glucose monitors, according to analysts. An even lower percentage use the devices globally. As sensors become smaller and easier to use, Dexcom and its competitors are betting that the systems will eventually be adopted by the much larger group of people with Type 2 diabetes, which is typically controlled with medications, diet and exercise. Last spring, Dexcom received regulatory approval for its sixth generation of glucose monitor, the G6, which does not require finger pricks for calibration for insulin dosing - improving the quality of life for patients. Dexcom began selling the G6 last summer. High demand led to some delays in shipping monitors, as well as long wait times or an inability to connect with customer service personnel. It is unclear whether those problems linger, though Dexcom has ramped up hiring to deal with the demand. Efforts to reach the company on Tuesday were unsuccessful. Dexcom announced pricing for the G6 in June. A box of three sensors that last 10 days cost $349. Two transmitters are priced at $475 per bundle, and a touchscreen receiver goes for $365.
