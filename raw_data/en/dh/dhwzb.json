Keywords: pregnancy, macrophage, regulatory T cell, natura l killer cell, placental pathology, fetal growth restriction, stillbirth INTRODUCTION Five to ten percent of pregnancies is complicated by fetal growth restriction (FGR) ( 1). FGR is dened as a fetus that is unable to reach its intrinsic growth potential ( 2). It is associated with an increased risk of neonatal mortality and morbidity ( 3,4) and adverse long term eects, like impaired neurodevelopmentandcardiovascular,endocrine,andmetab diseases ( 5). Abnormal placentation leading to placental the in placental inflammation and oxidative stress ( 8). FGR is thought to be responsible for nearly one third of stillborn (SB) infants (1,5), however, a large part of intrauterine deaths remains unexplained ( 9). Numbers of SB are large, with an estimated 2.6 million cases in 2015 worldwide ( 10). Placental pathology is a common nding in SB and FGR ( 11,12). The main placental lesions found pregnancy as ogy (VUE)(13). The role of the maternal immune system in pregnancy complications has gained increasing attention, with specic interest for the involvement of immune cell subsets in placen tal development and functioning, and maternal-fetal tolerance. T he maternal immune system is subjected to paternal antigens expressedbythefetusviadirectcontactbetweenfetaltropho blast cells,presentinthevilloustissueandspiralarteries,andm aternal blood (14). Moreover, transfer of fetal and/or placental cells and DNA through the placental barrier into the maternal circulat ion occurs throughout gestation, referred to as micro-chimeri sm (15-18). This requires a state in which maternal immune cell subsets cooperate to ensure a tolerogenic environment for th e developingfetus( 19). In healthy pregnancies, immune cells are balanced toward an immunoregulatory phenotype. For example, macrophages predominantlyexpressananti-inflammatory,M2-likephenotype that is involved in tissue remodeling and homeostasis ( 20-24), numbers of Treg cells participate in preserving maternal-fetal tolerance ( 25-31), and numbers increase in response to fetal alloantigen ( 32), and NK cells show a reduction of the cytotoxic subset and an increase in NK cells with immunomodulatory potential ( 33-36). Furthermore, macrophages and NK cells have been attributed important roles in various aspects of placenta l development, including trophoblast invasion, spiral artery ( SA)remodeling, and tissue regeneration and angiogenesis ( 37- 43). Moreover, exaggerated maternal immune responses can be seen in combination with inflammatory histologically placen tal lesions that are commonly found in pregnancy complications (44,45).Inadequate adaptationof thematernalimmune system, in particular at the maternal fetal interface, has been widel y described in adverse pregnancy outcomes like preeclampsia ( 29, 46-49), preterm birth ( 50-52), and spontaneous pregnancy loss (28,53,54). However, little is known about possible immune cell imbalances in FGR and SB. As placental malfunctioning is thought to be a key factor in the cause or exacerbation of thes e complications of pregnancy ( 6-8,11,12), it is likely that altered immunecellbalancesareatplay. Obtaining more insight into the presence of decidual macrophages, T cells, Treg cells, and NK cells in healthy and complicated pregnancies provides a basis for better understandingtheroleoftheseimmunecellsinthepathogenes is of pregnancy complications. The present study therefore aims to explore the number of decidual macrophages, the M2 macrophage subset, T cells, NK cells in FGR and SB,andassociatedtypesofplacentallesions,MVM,FVM,DVM, CA, and VUE, in order to generate hypotheses on immune cell subsetsinvolvedinthesepregnancycomplications. MATERIALS AND METHODS Study Design Study cases with placenta samples and histology reports of three historical study cohorts were included. The DIGITAT cohort (Disproportionate Intrauterine Growth Intervention At Term) included women between 36 and 41 weeks of pregnancy with a singleton with suspected FGR diagnosed by a small for gestational age (SGA) fetus: a fetal abdominal circumferenc e below the 10th centile, estimated fetal weight below the 10t h centile or a decreased relative growth in the third trimeste r (as judged by a clinician) though still above the 10th centile. Exclusion criteria were a history of cesarean section (CS), serious congenital defects, ruptured membranes, renal disea ses, diabetes mellitus, or a positive fetal diagnosed antepartum after 20 week s of gestation. SB was diagnosed if fetal heartbeat ceased befo re labor. We included all women who gave birth from 36 weeks of gestation onwards. Exclusion criteria were pregnanc y terminations (for congenital malformations) and intrapart um deaths (56). The NORMA cohort comes from a local study Frontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org 2 August 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 1898Bezemer et al. Complicated Pregnancy Outcomes and Immunity performed at the University Medical Center Groningen that included healthy pregnancies. Fetuses with a birth weight ab ove the 10th centile and below the 90th centile were selected as our control cohort. Women who gave birth from 36 weeks onward were included, provided that their blood pressure was withinthenormalrange,theirpregnancieswerenotcomplicate d by preeclampsia, and women did not use medication. In total, samplesof250FGR,64SB,and42healthypregnancycasescould be included. The hematoxylin eosin (HE) stained tissue slid es werere-analyzedandclassiedforplacentalhistologicles ionsby asingleperinatalpathologistblindedforclinicaldetailsa ccording to the latest international criteria developed by the Amster dam PlacentalWorkshopGroup( 13). Immunohistochemistry After delivery, the placentas were xed in formalin; one full- thickness sample of normal-appearing parenchyma from within the central two-thirds of the placental disc for each case was taken, and embedded in paran. Biopsies were taken according to the hospital sampling protocol as later described by the Amsterdam Placental Workshop Group ( 13). Tissue sections of 3\u00b5m thickness were cut in consecutive slides where possible. Primary antibodies used were CD68 for CD206 and FOXP3. Slides were deparanized with xylene and washed in PBS. Antigen retrieval was performed with 10mM Tris/1mM EDTA pH 9.0 solution in the microwave for 15min at 300 or 500 Watt, cooled down for 20min at room temperature and washedwithPBSfor5min.Blockingendogenousperoxidasewas done using 500 \u00b5l 30% H 2O2in 50ml PBS for 30min. Slides were washed in PBS for 5min and incubated for 60min with the primary antibody FOXP3 in a dilution of 1:100, or with the primary antibody CD206 in a dilution of 1:800. Slides were 1:100 for 30min with an additional washing step after each antibody incubation. Slides were incubated for 10min in ultra 3,3-diaminobenzidine-tetrahydrochloride (DAB) peroxidase, diluted in 50ml PBS and 50 \u00b5l H 2O2. After washing in demi water, hematoxylin counterstaining w as performed. Slides were dehydrated, dried and covered with mounting medium and a cover slip. For CD68, CD3, and CD56, IHCwasperformedwiththeVentanaBenchmarkUltramachine withtheUltraviewDABKit(Ventana,USA).Deparanizingthe slides and blocking of endogenous peroxidase is an automatiz ed process performed in the machine at 72. Antigen retrieval was performed with a 10mM Tris/1mM EDTA pH 9.0 CD3 and CD56. Slides were incubated with the primary antibodies, for CD68 and 32min CD3 diluted to 1:100, CD3 and CD56 antibodies were delivered ready to use. For CD56, an Amplication Kit (Ventana, USA) was used to increase thesignal intensity of the CD56 primary antibody. The Tissue-Te k PrismaE2SmachinewasusedtoautomaticallyperformtheDAB reaction, hematoxylin counterstaining, and dehydration of the slidesandapplicationofacoverslip. Slides were scanned with the Philips Intellisite Pathology Solution Ultra-Fast scanner 1.6.1.1.12. In the scans for FOXP 3, thenumberofcellswasmanuallycountedduetothelownumber of cells in each tissue slide. Digital analysis was performed using Visiopharm version 2018.4. In order to create automati c detectionclassierstocountthenumberofcells,scansforCD 68, CD206,CD3,andCD56wereanalyzedwithQuPathversion0.1.2 (57).Inshort,distinctcelltypes(e.g.,stromalcells,immunece lls, background staining) were manually labeled in decidual tis sue basedonstainingpatternandcellmorphology.Withthislabeli ng set as example, an automatic detection classier was built and applied on all tissue slides to count the immune cells of interes t. Separate classiers were developed for each immune cell subset . Detailedinstructionscanbefoundonline( 58). An example of the detection classier developed to analyze CD68+macrophages can be found in SupplementaryFigure1 . In both programs, all decidua basalis tissue in the tissue section was encircled as region of interest. Availability o f viable decidual tissue, therefore size of the encircled area , varied per section. Placental septa, decidua tissue overlyin ble trophoblast and decidualized endometrium stromal cells and areas with hemorrhage were not included in the encircled surface area. The encircling of the decidua and the development of the detection classier was performed by two of the authors. As shown in SupplementaryFigure1 , the detection classier distinguished three levels of color intensity for each IHC stain. All positive stained cells were analyzed as immune cells, regardless of the detected intensity of staining. The decidual surface was given in \u00b5m2and the outcome calculated as number of cells/mm2 decidualtissue. Statistical Analysis IBM SPSS Statistics 23 was used for statistical analyses. QQ-plots and the Shapiro-Wilk test were used to test the normality of the distribution. The Chi-square test was used for categorical data, the independent sample T-test for normally distributed continuous data and the Mann-Whitney U-test for not normally distributed continuous data. To compare between multiple groups, the Chi-square test was used for categorical data with pairwise Chi-square with Bonferroni correction as a post-hoc test. The one-way ANOVA was used for normally distributed data with Tukey's HSD as apost-hoc test. The Kruskal Wallis test was used for not normally distributed data with the Dunn's non-parametric comparison as a post-hoctest. Similarity of distributions across the patient groups was conrmed by visual inspection of boxplots.Finally,todeterminewhethertheassociationsbe tween immune cell subsets and patient groups (FGR, SB, healthy controls, and placental lesion groups) were independent of smoking status, we performed linear regression analyses.

Ethics Approval of the Medical Ethical Evaluation Committee (METc) has been obtained for the DIGITAT (Leiden University medical Center, Leiden, the Netherlands: Medical Center Groningen, Groningen, the Netherlands: M02.00671). The present study has been conducted in accordance with the METc recommendations. For the NORMA study placental tissue was used according to the codeofconductforresponsibleusefollowingtheguidelinef rom the Federation of Medical Scientic Associations with approva l oftheMETc. RESULTS Patient characteristics are presented in Table1. No signicant dierences were found for maternal age, fetal sex, and parity between FGR and SB and healthy pregnancies. Gestational age (GA) at birth, birth weight, and placental weight were lower i n theFGRgroup( p<0.001,p<0.001,and p<0.001,respectively) andSBgroup( p<0.001,p<0.001,and p<0.001,respectively) compared to More neonates from the FGR and SB groups had a birth weight <p3 compared to the control group (p<0.001 and p<0.001, respectively). The percentage of women who smoke during pregnancy was higher in the FGR groupcomparedtocontrolgroup( p<0.05).Immune Cell Subsets in Adverse Pregnancy Outcomes For each immune cell, we determined the number of cells per mm2decidual tissue and compared this between FGR and healthy pregnancies, and SB and healthy pregnancies. In addition, we determined the CD206+/CD68+and FOXP3+/CD3+ratios. Immune Cell Subsets in the FGR Cohort: Higher Numbers of Macrophages With Lower M2/Total Macrophage Ratios, and Higher FOXP3+/CD3+ Ratios The number of CD68+macrophages was signicantly higher in decidual tissue of FGR pregnancies compared to control pregnancies ( p<0.001) and showed an increase of more than 50% in the FGR group. Although absolute numbers of CD206+ cells (M2-like macrophages) were comparable between the FGR pregnancies and control pregnancies, the CD206+/CD68+ ratio was signicantly lower in the FGR cohort compared to controls ( p<0.01). In addition, numbers of FOXP3+ Treg cells were increased in FGR ( p<0.01) ( p<0.01;Figures1 , 2A,B). Linear regression analysis and comparing the cohorts with exclusion of all women who smoke in the FGR and control cohort, showed that these ndings were independent of smoking status. Numbers of CD3+T cells, and CD56+NK cells were comparable between FGR and healthy pregnancies (Figure2A ).

Immune Cell Subsets in the SB Cohort: Higher FOXP3+/CD3+Ratios Signicantly higher numbers of FOXP3+T cells were found in SB compared to healthy pregnancies ( p<0.05), as well as a higher FOXP3+Treg/CD3+ratio in SB compared to control ( p <0.01). These ndings were independent of smoking status in the linear regression analysis, however, a signicant dier ence was not found after excluding all women that smoke from the cohorts ( Figures3 ,4A,B). Moreover, a trend was found for higher numbers of CD68+macrophages in SB compared to healthy pregnancies ( p<0.1), however, the higher numbers of CD68+macrophages did not remain to be a trend after correcting for smoking status. Numbers of CD56+NK cells and CD206+M2-like macrophages Immune Cell Subsets in Placental Lesions In addition to adverse pregnancy outcomes, we studied the numbersofimmunecellsinhistopathologicplacentalesions.Distribution of Placental Lesions in FGR, SB, and Healthy Pregnancies First, the prevalence of lesions was determined in each cohort (Figure5). Placental lesions were grouped into placentas diagnosed with a single lesion (MVM, FVM, DVM, CA, or VUE), a combination of multiple lesions (ML) and no lesions (NL). Cases with DVM were only observed in the SB cohort. The incidence of multiple lesions was highest in pregnancies complicatedwithSBcomparedtoFGR( p<0.01)andthecontrol group (p<0.05). In the FGR cohort, the multiple lesion group was predominated by VUE which was present in 45 out of 70 multiple lesions cases (64%). In the SB cohort, the multiple lesion group was predominated by CA present in 19 out of 24 multiple lesion cases (79%). The control cohort had only 4 case s of multiple lesions, predominated by VUE in 3 out of 4 cases (75%). Placentas without lesions were more frequently found in the FGR and control cohort, compared to the SB cohort ( p< 0.01) and ( p<0.01). VUE compared to SB cohort ( p<0.05), whereas placentas showing of nt dierencecomparedtotheFGRcohort( p<0.001).

Immune Cell Subsets in Placental Lesions in the FGR Cohort: Higher Numbers of T and Treg Cells and Higher Treg/T Cell Ratios in VUE Due to the low number of cases in each lesion group within the SB and control cohort, we decided to compare the immune cell numbers between placental lesion groups in the FGR cohort only. The number of decidual CD3+T cells was signicantly higher in VUE and multiple lesions compared to no placental lesions (p<0.01 and p<0.001, respectively). These higher numbers of CD3+T cells were accompanied by signicantly higher numbers of decidual FOXP3+Treg cells in placentas showing signs of VUE ( and multiple lesions placentas without lesions ( Figures6 , 7A). To determine if the observed higher numbers of FOXP3+ Treg cells were related to the number of CD3+T cells in the decidua, we determined the FOXP3+/CD3+ratio. Our results show a signicantly higher FOXP3+Treg cell/CD3+total T cell ratio in VUE and the multiple lesion group compared to no lesions ( p<0.01 and p<0.05, respectively), which was independent of smoking behavior. This could indicate not onl y an absolute but also a relative increase in FOXP3+Treg cells (Figure7B ). Higher numbers of CD206+M2-like macrophages were observed in placentas with multiple lesions compared to placentas with no lesions ( p<0.05), although this did not result in dierences in the CD206+M2-like/CD68+total macrophageratio( Figures7A,B ).Wedidnotnddierencesin and Since FOXP3+/CD3+ratios were increased in both FGR, SB, and the VUE and ML groups, we performed a sub analysis in order to determine whether the presence of VUE and multiple lesions could be responsible for the relative increa se of FOXP3+Treg cells in FGR and SB. We excluded all casesof VUE and multiple lesions from the FGR, SB and control cohorts and the dierences in FOXP3+/CD3+ratios did not remainsignicant. DISCUSSION The main nding of this study is that in FGR, decidual macrophages appear to have a more inflammatory phenotype comparedtohealthypregnancies.Ourndingsareinaccordanc e with previous studies that found preeclampsia, spontaneous pregnancy loss, and preterm birth to be associated with higher numbers of total macrophages with increased expression of an M1-like, pro-inflammatory macrophage phenotype ( 47,50, 53,54,59-61). Moreover, a recent study found an increase of placentalmacrophagesinpregnanciesinwhichthefetusshowed a decreased growth rate in the third trimester, accompanied b y elevatedpro-inflammatorymarkersintheplacentaandmaterna l blood (62). The authors propose placental senescence as a mechanism for placental dysfunction in FGR, underpinned by the absence of elevated CD45+leukocytes and clinical signs of infection, as well as upregulation of DAMPs, associated with oxidativestress,necrosis,andcellularinjury.Similarre sultswere seeninauric-acidinducedplacentalinflammationmousemodel , were pups developed FGR and an increase of macrophages was found in the placental junctional zone ( 63). Contrary to our results, another study has reported lower numbers of CD14+ macrophages in the placental bed in FGR compared to healthy pregnancies, although this did not reach a signicant level (49). These dierences could be due to the use of dierent markers and/or a dierent placenta sampling location.

Furthermore, the nding that the altered macrophage balance s in the decidua appears maternal in origin is an interesting nding in terms of preserving maternal-fetal tolerance and it could be hypothesized that an exaggerated maternal immune response to the fetal and placental tissue is involved. Our res ults indicate that altered decidual macrophage balances could be involved in FGR and mark the importance of more research on this topic. We suggest performing functionality studies on decidual macrophages and a broader characterization of thei r phenotypeatdierenttimepointsingestationtodeterminethei r contributiontoFGR. Overall, the incidence of placental lesions was higher in FGR and SB compared to the control group. Interestingly, chorioamnionitis(CA)formedanexceptionandwasfoundtobe more frequently present in placentas from healthy pregnancies , a nding that can most likely be attributed to dierences in onset of labor. In the majority of the controls, delivery occurred spontaneously in healthy pregnancies, whereas in th e pregnancies complicated by FGR and SB a majority of women had induction of labor. It has earlier been shown that CA is seen more often in pregnancies with spontaneous onset of labor, compared to induction ( 64) and compared to cesarean section(65).Thisndinghasbeenexplainedbythephysiological inflammatory process that precedes spontaneous parturition, associated with the presence of inflammatory markers in the myometrium, cervix and chorioamniotic membranes ( 64). Alsoin a sub analysis of the DIGITAT trial, CA was more frequently present FGR pregnancies with spontaneous labor compared to induction( 66). When examining the presence of immune cell subsets in common placental lesions within the FGR cohort we showed higher numbers of FOXP3+Treg cells and CD3+T cells, as well as a relative increase in FOXP3+Treg cells in cases of VUE and multiple lesions. VUE is characterized by an inflammatory inltrate of Hobauer cells and maternal CD4 +and CD8 + T cells (67,68) with irregular involvement of the chorionic villi and areas of placental parenchyma that remain unaected (69). The etiology of VUE remains poorly understood. Since not an infective organism can be identied, its cause has bee n explained by either a non-diagnosed underlying infection or a n exaggerated maternal immune response to the paternal antigen s expressed on the fetal villous tissue ( 67-70). Interestingly, placentas with VUE show upregulation of MHC class I and II on fetal trophoblast, accompanied by an increase of chemokine s withintheplacentaandmaternalandfetalcirculation,indi cating asystemicinflammatoryresponseinbothmotherandfetus.This nding supports the hypothesis of graft vs. host-like response in VUE ( 71). VUE has been abundantly associated with FGR (69,70,72-75). The reported incidence of histological ndings of VUE in FGR widely varies, which might be explained by dierences in diagnostic criteria. In our study, in which we u sed thelatestinternationalcriteriaforclassifyingplacental pathology (13),wefoundVUEtobepresentin18%ofFGRcasescompared to 7% in healthy controls. The increase of Treg cells in VUE at the inflammatory sites in the villous parenchyma, was rst shown by Katzman et al. They propose that Tregs inltrate these sites in order to regulate the immune responses that are potentially harmful toward the fetus ( 76). As we studied the Frontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org 8 August 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 1898Bezemer et al.

FGR, fetal growth restriction; VUE, villitis of unknown eti ology. decidua, we were able to discover higher numbers of Treg cell s and T cells in the maternal compartment of the placenta in VUE. We hypothesize that the decidual Treg cells increase in the decidua in order to home toward the villi. The migration of maternal Treg cells could therefore be seen as a mechanism of rescuingthefailedmaternal-fetaltolerance,whichcomplie swith the role of Treg cells in preventing maternal immune responses toward the allogeneic fetus and placenta ( 27,28). Earlier, it has been shown that cells inltrating the fetal villous tissueareindeedmaternalinorigin( 44,77).Weproposesimilar immunophenotyping and in situhybridization studies with X and Y chromosome probes in both the decidual tissue and placentalparenchymatoconrmifthisalsotrueforTregcells . Like in VUE, we found a relative increase in FOXP3+Treg cellsinbothFGRandSB,comparedtohealthypregnancies.The fact that this not correspond to a reduction in Treg cells that is found in most pregnancy complications, might be attributed to the high number of placental lesions within our study cohorts , since we showed that our results did not remain signicant af ter excludingVUEandmultiplelesionsintheanalysis.Moreover,itcouldbeexplainedbythefactthatwestudiedthedeciduaatte rm. A study in allogeneic mice showed that depletion of Tregs earl y in pregnancy caused implantation failure and higher resorptio n rates,whiledepletionlaterinpregnancydidnotcausepregnan cy complicationslikeFGR,hypertension,orproteinuria.Ithasbe en suggested that Treg cells are particularly important in the ea rly phase of pregnancy, but not necessarily for the remainder of pregnancy ( 28), which could explain why we do not nd lower FOXP3+expressioninourtermdecidualsamplesofFGRandSB pregnancies. Notably, numbers of FOXP3+cells are very low in our study cohorts (on average 2-3 cells/mm2), likely explained by the physiological decline in Treg cells as delivery approache s (32). We suggest studying Treg cells in the rst and second trimester, for example in maternal blood or in placental tissu e after pregnancy terminations, to observe possible alteration s in TregcellsoverthecourseofFGRandSBpregnancies. Concerning decidual CD56+NK cells, we did not nd dierences between FGR and SB and healthy pregnancies.

Because our detection classier is netunedfor variations in the intensity of IHC and background stains between tissue slides to prevent major dierences in cell count , the three levels of color intensity (as shown for macrophages inSupplementaryFigure1 ) cannot be used to distinguish Frontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org 10 August 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 1898Bezemer et al. Complicated Pregnancy Outcomes and Immunity CD56brightfromCD56dimsubsets.However,sincethesesubsets can, respectively, be attributed cytotoxic and immunoregul atory characteristics ( 34), it would be interesting to determine if decidualNKsubsetimbalancesmightbeinvolvedinFGRandSB . Interestingly, we found an exceptionally high number of women who smoked during pregnancy, 100 out of 250 (40%) in the FGR cohort, 18 out of 64 (28.1%) in the SB cohort, and 10 out of 42 (23.8%) in the control cohort. Smoking is known to be a contributing factor to lower birth weights and t o SB (79), and is known to directly harm placental development and vascularization ( 80). Alterations in immune cell balances in women who smoke during pregnancy ( >10 cigarettes per day) have been observed in rst trimester decidua and in peripheral blood (81). In order to see whether our results on macrophages and Treg cells in the FGR and SB cohort could be influenced by women's smoking behavior, we performed a linear regressio n analysis, showing that our results on macrophages and Treg cells in the FGR cohort and Treg cells in the SB cohort were independent of smoking status. Additionally, we conducted a sub-analysis in which we excluded all women who smoked from the three cohorts. Our main nding, the higher numbers of macrophages in FGR with a decrease of the anti-inflammatory subset,againremainedsignicant,indicatingastrongass ociation betweenFGRandalteredmacrophagelevels. In the selected cases with available histopathologic data fr om the DIGITAT (FGR) cohort, 203 out of 250 children were born with a birth weight below the third centile other known that focusing on SGA (usually cut- o<p10) in a study cohort of FGR provides an overestimation of the fetuses that are truly growth restricted in that SGA group (82). By using the worst cases ( <p3) for our analysis chances are low that the results are diluted by healthy SGA fetuses. However, we strongly advocate to routinely perform histopathologic examination of all suspected FGR pregnancies to gain a better understanding of the pathophysiology and immunologyofthiscomplication. Thehypothesesdiscussedinthisstudyarestrengthenedbyth e extensive number of placenta samples that were included from large databases derived from the DIGITAT (FGR), ZOBAS (SB), and NORMA (healthy pregnancies) studies. We have chosen to adopt the predened inclusion criteria from these studies, exceptfortheGAatbirthinordertomatchpregnancyduration between our cohorts. This could have compromised the use of a narrower denition of FGR, SB, and healthy neonates, howeve r, we feel that this does not outweigh the benets of analyzing a large study cohort. By developing a detection classier for each immune cell subset, we have been able to count the number of immune cells per surface area of decidual tissue in a systematic manner reducing observer variability. As the u se of historic patient cohorts limits the availability of the ti ssue samples, a selection of IHC markers had to be made. In order to investigate a variety of immune cells, we have chosen to use one IHC marker for each subset. No double staining wasperformed for this study. Although these markers were carefu lly selected, the use of one IHC marker for each subset does limit the reliability of immune cell identication. In the DIGITAT , ZOBAS, and NORMA cohorts, biopsies of the supercial part of the decidua basalis were taken. For future research, it wo uld be interesting to investigate placental bed biopsies in order t o determine the localization of immune cells with respect to spir al arteries. It must furthermore be mentioned that, as applies to any IHC study, the observed decidual immune cell populations could be the result of non-specic immune cell inltration that reflect a maternal immune response to mechanisms like infarction, hypoxia, or inflammation. The tissue was cut in consecutive slides were possible and it can therefore be assu med that numbers of total macrophages and T cells were rather equal so that CD206+/CD68+and FOXP3+/CD3+ratios could be determined in our samples. Since only paran placental tissue was available from our cohorts, no functionality test s could be performed. Even though we consider this to be a limitation of our study, we believe that this methodology doe s not compromise our results, nor the aim of this study. Our ndings bring focus to specic immune cell subsets that are likely involved in the pathogenesis of FGR, SB, and placental lesions and clearly show immune cell imbalances in these pregnancy complications. We urge for more in-depth research with elaborate immunophenotyping and functionality studies to bettercharacterizetheseimmunecellsubsets. CONCLUSION FGR and SB are complex and multifactorial pregnancy complications of which the immunologic background has received little attention. Due to our historical databases consisting of a large number of FGR and SB cases with systematicallyclassieddataonplacentalhistopathologic lesions, this study is the rst to analyze immune cell subsets in these adverse pregnancy outcomes and placenta lesions on a large scale. Our study indicates a role for macrophages in the pathophysiology of FGR, with an additional relative decrease of an anti-inflammatory macrophage subset in FGR. Additionally, our ndings point toward a relative increase of Treg cells in VUE, FGR, and SB, possibly explained by a compensatory response to rescue the failed maternal-fetal tolerance. The se insights highlight the importance of further investigating the functional activity and subset balances of macrophages and Treg cells in pregnancies complicated by FGR, SB, and placentallesions.
