[http://www.motherjones.com/blue-marble/2014/02/public-opinion-astrology-dumb] I'd guess this is a fairly accurate picture (that's a graph of the % of Americans who reject astrology as scientific). Seeing the position of these stars on this graph, I can predict it won't go better anytime soon... Too true! There is also \"common sense\" learning, that many never acquire.\"Although this undoubtedly included some techniques that could help identify these beliefs, there's no indication that the students applied them without explicit instructions to do so.\" - does this really bother anyone else? I mean, should students need to be told how and when to apply the techniques they have learned? I see what you're saying, but I think we have to remember what 'learning' actually is. Look at word problems in basic math. Yes, they're hated, but they really do prove that you've 'learned' the material. Rote memorization is one skill, and application is an entirely different skill. Most people can memorize a bunch of critical thinking techniques, but that's not the same as learning how to apply them, just like most people who have passed middle school math can do 25*.90*1.07 but don't necessarily know how to figure out the post-tax price of a $25 item is that's 10% off.

How quickly can we roll this out nationwide? Wow!no one is immune to bullshit. not even scientists. scientists will have their whole career made on the strength of a theory... then, gradually, it's discredited... but the progenitor of the theory fights it to the day they die, because, heck, man, that's their claim to fame. ideas can be seductive. passions work to blind us from \"truth.\" i can only imagine how it feels to work on a theory for a decade and slowly, undoubtedly realize that you are solidly wrong. there goes ten years of your life. you have a budget meeting next week to ask for more grant money... ouch. i think the \"debunking archeology\" class is a fantastic idea. just the ticket for an intellectually corpusculent america... but, let's not forget about cases like that of Lynn Margulis, who was \"debunked\" repeatedly before people realized that she was actually on to something. i feel like we need a few nutters that doggedly stick to outlier theories, because without such people, greater progress will slow or stop. without calmer minds to crunch the numbers, though, things would cross the x-files barrier rapidly ...

Any chance some of that is confusion between astrology and astronomy?Surveys show they're widely popular; nearly half the US population thinks astrology is either somewhat or very scientific, and the number has gone up over time. To be honest, if that question came up without any further explanation, I might answer it that way too. I can't ever keep the two straight... some scientific fields like geology end in '-logy' so I always get confused. Antikythera mechanismKeep in mind, while astrology and astronomy have existed nearly simultaneously, the former was \"relied\" on as a science for eons before astronomy ever had a chance. Until Copernicus, just trying to keep track of the motion of celestial bodies in the sky was a huge calculation challenge. You were as- or more likely to make testable predictions that came true with astrology than astronomy for a long, long time. Of course, many of those predictions would have been self-fulfilling given the beliefs of the cultures of the time.In defense of the uninformed consider the following: Astrology Archaeology Biology Physiology Psychology Pharmacology Dendrochronology etc and etc and etc the wikipedia reference actually lists -ology as \"a scientific discipline\" so you have to have specific knowledge of an exception to a general rule. Of course popular culture has co-opted ology for its own use, type bracketology in you search engine and it won't be a rigorous scientific field that comes up first. (Go Ducks!) His hands are much bigger, for a start.Sasquatch is very upset with you for impugning his character.Saying the Sasquatch does not exist is utterly ridiculous. He's been elected president As much as I hate to propose the possibility, I'm none-the-less awaiting the comment which asserts that the phrase: \"The study, done by Anne Collins McLaughlin and Alicia McGill ...\" ... somehow stands as \"proof\" that the study its self is a component of a much larger \"SJW Conspiracy\" organized to discredit and undermine the rightfully ordained societal status quo. I expect the comment to be offered by a 1st time \"curious patron\" of the Comet Ping Pong pizzeria.

If there's any evidence that acupuncture works, we need to see it, and I wantCalling \"alternative medicine\" unscientific is painting with too broad a brush. The Western medical establishment has many myths of its own, promoted by drug companies, foundations, and other influential actors who have a vested interest in certain theories. A true skeptic believes nothing, but looks at everything. Reductionist, disease-based medicine has a lot of difficulty seeing the complex interactions between our various bodily systems, our environment, and our minds (nervous system?). Often, substances or concepts from non-Western societies, many of them tried and accepted over a very long period of time, can be more effective than the latest wonder drug promoted for profit. If it's a \"substance... from non-Western societies\" it's subject to testing and can quickly become \"medicine\" and not \"alternative medicine\". The field of ethnobotany is the scientific study of how other cultures use botanicals with the aim of identifying useful ones. If it's a concept or procedure, that can be tested too. E.g. there's good support for some applications of acupuncture. There's no support for homeopathy. But for any of these, a critical thinking approach is necessary. It's entirely appropriate that a critical thinking class should take a look at what is and isn't supported by the evidence. Especially because that changes over time (as things that were not previously tested get tested). Medical Marijuana is the exception that proves the rule. It's one of the few \"alternative medicine\" substances that isn't obviously dangerous, and yet has not been thoroughly studied.There are more routes to health than only western medicine, and denying the validity of anything except that is a poor viewpoint... Western medicine has been methodically adapted to fold in tested and validated methods of treatment from around the globe. When a purported treatment is rejected as snake oil it's typically because it belongs on the pile with \"the Earth being 6,000 years old, the number 13 being unlucky, astrology, crop circles, the Illuminati, and the Moon landing being a hoax.\" One example that is likely to prove popular here on Ars is medical marijuana. It has not been proven to work, nor has it proven to be without harm, yet there is substantial evidence that it can provide better pain relief with lower harm than \"medically approved\" opiates, at least for some conditions. Thus, marijuana is currently \"alternative medicine\". Unproven does not mean false or without value. It just means unproven. That example is proving my point. Look at the complexity necessary to make a solid astronomical prediction. Also, it's only 2,300 years old or so. Mystics, shamans, diviners, etc. have been reading signs in bones, tea leaves, animal scat, and the stars for at least as long as recorded human history.Antikythera mechanismKeep in mind, while astrology and astronomy have existed nearly simultaneously, the former was \"relied\" on as a science for eons before astronomy ever had a chance.
