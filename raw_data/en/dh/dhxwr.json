During the 2022-2023 academic year, the College of Medicine is home to 740 M.D. students, 194 Ph.D. students, 118 students in the combined M.D.-Ph.D. program, and 255 postdoctoral research fellows at our Belfer Institute for Advanced Biomedical Studies. More than 9,000 Einstein alumni are among the nation's foremost clinicians, biomedical scientists and medical educators. When the medical school opened its doors in 1955, the New York Times was already noting that \"the new medical school's distinguished and talented faculty assured the institution of a place in the ranks of the great medical schools in the world.\" This prophecy has been more than fulfilled in the ensuing years. Among its pioneering educational initiatives, Einstein was one of the first major medical schools to integrate bedside experience with learning, bringing first-year students into contact with patients and linking classroom study to case experience. Einstein also led the way in developing bioethics as an accepted academic discipline in medical school curricula, was the first private medical school in New York City to establish an academic department of family medicine, and was the first to create a residency program in internal medicine with an emphasis on women's health. Einstein runs one of the largest residency and fellowship training programs in the medical and dental professions in the United States through Montefiore and a [network of affiliates](/health/affiliates.asp) that includes hospitals and medical centers in the Bronx, Brooklyn and on Long Island. In addition to its M.D. program, the College of Medicine offers programs for earning a Ph.D. in biomedical sciences, a joint M.D.-Ph.D., an M.S. in clinical research, and in collaboration with Cardozo Law, an M.S. in bioethics. Yeshiva University is an affiliate of Einstein, under whose auspices the College of Medicine was originally founded. Einstein became an independent degree-granting institution "}
