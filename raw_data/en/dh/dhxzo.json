Your little one is fully prepped for life outside the womb, with all systems (including organs and reflexes) a go. You're in good company if you've passed your due date: About 1 in 3 pregnancies will hit the 41-week mark! If you're 40 weeks pregnant, you're in month 9 of your pregnancy. It's almost time! Still have questions? Here's some more information on Right now, your baby probably weighs anywhere from 6 to 9 pounds and measures between 19 and 22 inches \u2014 though tons of perfectly healthy babies are born smaller or bigger. At 40 weeks pregnant, you're at the official end of your pregnancy. You, or actually the placenta, are still providing the antibodies she'll need to fight off infections for the first six months of her life. But if you plan on breastfeeding, The first thing you're likely to look for when your new arrival makes that dramatic \u2014 and possibly fashionably late \u2014 entrance: proof positive that your baby is actually a boy or a girl. That major mystery solved once and for all, you'll also notice that baby, besides being cute as can be, is wearing a little leftover travel dust consisting of blood, vernix, lanugo and amniotic fluid. From your baby's perspective, you'll look a bit blurry \u2014 at birth, babies' central vision is still developing \u2014 but that's okay. Just be sure to say hello to your new arrival, since your baby will very likely recognize the sound of your voice and your partner's. You'll notice your little one is still curled in the fetal position, although her arms and legs may flail a bit. That's because after nine months in such cramped quarters, it'll take a while before your baby realizes she has room to spread out. And because it's the only position she has really known, it's a comforting one to be in. That's also why so many newborns (though not all!) like to be When will your body know it's time to deliver this baby? Just because your due date is marked with pen on your practitioner's chart and red marker on your calendar doesn't mean that Mother Nature's gotten the memo. About 30 percent of all pregnancies last longer than 40 weeks, and it's anyone's guess when yours might end. Thankfully, your practitioner probably won't let it go longer than 41 weeks.

But your reality show will probably be a little different. First, fewer than 15 percent of women experience a rupture of the membranes before labor begins, and second, if your water does break in public, it's less likely to come as a torrential tidal wave and more likely to come as a slow leak, trickle or small gush. One thing you can be pretty sure of if your water breaks before your contractions have started: Labor will likely begin in earnest within 24 hours. Either that or your practitioner will start it for you within 24 hours. How can you tell if your amniotic sac has ruptured? Amniotic fluid is usually colorless and odorless. If you notice fluid that looks yellowish and smells of ammonia, you're probably leaking urine. Another test: You can try to stem the flow of the fluid by squeezing your pelvic muscles (Kegel exercises). If the flow stops, it's urine. If it doesn't, it's amniotic fluid. If your water breaks and the fluid is green or brown, be sure to call your practitioner right away. It could mean that your baby has had a bowel movement ( Many women share an unfounded Mother Nature knows the drill, and the majority of newborns are pretty well-matched to the size of their moms.

Feeling a little extra furry these days? A definite no-no: shaving in the shower, where a slip-up could be serious. Like When the contractions are upon you, you may want to soak in a warm bath or shower, or have warm or cold compresses placed on your lower back or pelvis. Or you may choose to labor in an actual tub and let the warm water soften your contractions. Once it's time to start pushing, however, you'll want to climb out of the bath. Babies born underwater are at risk of several potentially serious complications. Don't have the energy for a full sweat session? Do a mini workout.
