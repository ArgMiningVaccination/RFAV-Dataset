ideal body weight (IBW) also may be used to determine doses for patients who are neither underweight nor obese Conventional dosing Extended dosing interval - Initial: 5-7 mg/kg/dose IV qDay - Not for use in patients with ascites, burns covering >20% of total body surface area, cystic fibrosis, end-stage renal disease, endocarditis, infants, mycobacterial infections, or pregnancy - Measure gentamicin level between 6 and 14 hr after initiating gentamicin infusion; use institution-specific nomogram to determine appropriate dosing interval Surgical Prophylaxis (Off-label) 5 mg/kg IV as single dose 1 hr prior to surgical incision; alternativley, 1.5 mg/kg IV as single dose for gynecology procedures Dose is based on actual body weight (TBW) unless body weight is >20% above ideal body weight (IBW), in which case the dosing weight can be estimated by IBW + 0.4 (TBW - IBW) Infective Endocarditis Treatment 3 mg/kg/day IV/IM divided q8hr for 4-6 weeks in combination with a beta-lactam and for 6 weeks when administered wiht vancomycin - Organism sensitivity testing should determine choice of concomitant antiibotic and treatment duration S. aureus (prosthetic valve; methicillin susceptible or resistant); Off-label dose - 3 mg/kg/day IV/IM divided q8-12hr for 3-5 days for native valve infections or for 2 weeks for prosthetic valve infections in combination with other antibiotic - Organism sensitivity testing should determine choice of concomitant antibiotic Viridans group streptococcus and S bovis (native or prosthetic valve); Off-label use - 3 mg/kg/day IV/IM qDay (preferred) or divided q8hr for 2 weeks for native or prosthetic valve infections or for 6 weeks for prosthetic valve infections with relatively or fully resistant strains in combination with other antibiotic - Organism sensitivity testing and source of infection should determine choice of concomitant antibiotic Cystic Fibrosis (Off-label) 7.5-10.5 IV IM Maintenance clindamycin IV IV qDay May initiate transition from parenteral to oral therapy of either oral doxycycline or oral clindamycin within 24-48 hr of clinical improvement for total treatment duration of 14 days Plague (Yersinia pestis) Treatment (Off-label) 5 mg/kg IV/IM qDay for 10 days then 1.7 mg/kg/dose IV/IM q8hr for 10-14 days or until 2 days after patient is afebrile; doxycycline, ciprofloxacin, or chloramphenicol could be used as third-line alternatives Dosage Modifications Renal impairment - Conventional dosing - Once daily (interval adjustment of extended interval dosing) - Intermittent hemodialysis - Administer after hemodialysis on dialysis days - Dependent on patients size, site of injection, filter, duration and type of intermittent hemodialysis, it is ~30-50% guide subsequent dosing - Dosing dependent on assumption of 3 times/wk complete intermittent hemodialysis sessions - Peritoneal dialysis - Intermittent dosing: 0.6 mg/kg per exchange once daily for anuric patients; 0.75 mg/kg/dose IP for non-anuric patients qDay during long dwell periods; depending on infecting organism and patient's clinical status, may treat for 2-3 weeks - Continuous dosing: 8 mg/L loading dose; followed by 4 mg/L maintenance dose - Intermittent dosing: 0.6 mg/kg per exchange once daily for anuric patients; 0.75 mg/kg/dose IP for non-anuric patients qDay during long dwell periods; depending on infecting organism and patient's clinical status, may treat for 2-3 weeks - Continuous renal replacement therapy - Drug clearance is highly dependent on method of renal replacement, filter type, and flow rate; close monitoring of pharmacologic response, sign of adverse reactions due to accumulation, and target drug concentration necessary for appropriate dosing - 3 mg/kg/day IV/IM divided q8hr; may administer divided q6-8hr in life-threatening infections; peak; serum monitoring; concentration >12 mcg/mL should be avoided Dosing Considerations Gentamicin may be administered IV/IM Infuse over 30-120 min when administering IV Dosing regimens are numerous and are adjusted based on CrCl and changes in volume of distribution, as well as on the body space where distribution of the agent will occur Monitor peak (4-12 mg/L) and trough (1-2 mg/L) Monitor nephrotoxicity, neurotoxicity, and ototoxicity; assess at beginning of therapy and throughout Each regimen must be followed by at least trough level drawn on third or fourth dose, 30 min before dosing unless renal toxicity suspected May draw peak level 30 min after 30-min infusion has been completed or 1 hr after IM injection Use ideal body weight for mg/kg/dose; more accurate than total body weight Gentamicin is usually a first-line aminoglycoside against infections with well as against Staphylococcus (gram- positive) Bacterial organisms causing susceptible infections - Susceptible infections include the following: - Pseudomonas aeruginosa - Proteus species (indole-positive Escherichia coli - Klebsiella-Enterobacter-Serratia species - Citrobacter species - Staphylococcus species (coagulase-positive and - - Escherichia coli - Klebsiella-Enterobacter-Serratia species - Citrobacter species - Staphylococcus (coagulase-positive and Gentamicin liposome injection: infection Orphan indication sponsor - Liposome Company, Inc; One Research Way; Princeton, NJ 08540 Dosage Forms & Strengths injectable solution - 10mg/mL - 40mg/mL Intravenous Susceptible Infections Use of ideal body weight (IBW) for determining the mg/kg/dose appears to be more accurate than on the basis of total body weight (TBW) Infants: mg/kg IV/IM within 60 min piror to surgical incision or without antibiotics; procedure dependent Dose is based on actual body weight unless >20% above ideal body weight; then dosage requirement may best be estimated using a dosing weight of IBW + 0.4 (TBW- IBW) Dosage dialysis: 2 mg/kg/dose; redose as indicated 2-2.5 mg/kg/dose mg/L) Monitor nephrotoxicity, neurotoxicity, and ototoxicity; assess at beginning of therapy and throughout Individualization critical due to low therapeutic index Use ideal body weight for mg/kg/dose, except in neonates (in whom actual body weight should be used) Bacterial organisms causing susceptible infections - Pseudomonas aeruginosa - Proteus species (indole-positive and indole-negative) - Escherichia coli - Klebsiella-Enterobacter-Serratia species - Citrobacter species - Staphylococcus species (coagulase-positive and coagulase-negative) Interactions Interaction Checker No Results Contraindicated Serious - Use Alternative Significant - Monitor Closely Minor Contraindicated (0) Serious - Use Alternative (24) - agalsidase alfa gentamicin decreases effects of agalsidase alfa by pharmacodynamic antagonism.

Pharmacology Mechanism of Action Aminoglycoside antibiotic for coverage of gram-negative bacteria, including Pseudomonas species; synergistic with beta lactamase against enterococci; interferes with bacterial protein synthesis by binding to 30S and 50S ribosomal subunits Absorption Peak plasma time: IM (30-90 min); IV (30 min after 30-min infusion) Distribution Gentamicin crosses placenta; relative diffusion from blood into CSF is minimal even with inflammation CSF-to-blood level and decreased by dehydration Elimination Half-life: 2-3 hr (NRF) Renal clearance: Directly related to renal function Excretion: Urine (70% recovered as unchanged drug in patients with NRF) Administration single dose in 50-200 mL NS or D5W IV Administration Infuse over 30 min-2 hr After infusion, flush line with NS or DataBank, Inc. Patient Handout gentamicin ophthalmic (eye) Garamycin, Gentak USES: This medication is used to treat bacterial infections (such as blepharitis, conjunctivitis) of the eye and the skin around the eyes (such as eyelids). It is also used to prevent infection after eye injury or surgery. It belongs to a class of drugs known as aminoglycoside antibiotics. Gentamicin works by killing the bacteria.This medication treats only bacterial eye infections. It will not work for other types of eye infections. Unnecessary use or misuse of any antibiotic can lead to its decreased effectiveness. HOW TO USE: To apply eye drops, wash your hands first. To avoid contamination, do not touch the dropper tip or let it touch your eye or any other surface. Use in the eyes only. Do not swallow or inject.Do not wear contact lenses while you are using this medication. Sterilize contact lenses according to the manufacturer's directions, and check with your doctor before you begin using them again.Tilt your head back, look upward, and pull down the lower eyelid to make a pouch. Hold the dropper directly over your eye and place one drop into the pouch as directed by your doctor. Look downward, gently close your eyes, and place one finger at the corner of your eye (near the nose). Apply gentle pressure for 1 to 2 minutes before opening your eyes. This will prevent the medication from draining out. Try not to blink or rub your eye. Repeat these steps for your other eye if so directed or if your dose is for more than 1 drop. Wait several minutes for your vision to clear before driving or operating machinery. Do not rinse the dropper. Replace the dropper cap after each use.The dosage is based on your medical condition and response to treatment. Your doctor may direct you to use this medication more often at first, then use it less often as the infection improves. Follow your doctor's directions carefully. Your doctor may prescribe gentamicin drops for use during the day and gentamicin ointment at bedtime.If you are using another kind of eye medication (such as drops or ointments), wait at least 5 minutes before applying other medications. Use eye drops before eye ointments to allow the drops to enter the eye.Use this medication regularly in order to get the most benefit from it. To help you remember, use it at the same times each day. Continue using it for the full time prescribed. Stopping the medication too soon may allow the bacteria to continue to grow, which may result in a return of the infection.Tell your doctor if your condition lasts or gets worse. SIDE EFFECTS: Eye stinging/burning/redness or temporary blurred vision may occur. If any of these effects last or get worse, tell your doctor or pharmacist promptly.Remember that this medication has been prescribed because your doctor has judged that the benefit to you is greater than the risk of side effects. Many people using this medication do not have serious side effects.Use of this medication for prolonged or repeated periods may result in other types of eye infections, including fungal infections. Stop using this medication and contact your doctor if you notice new or worsening eye symptoms (such as pain, swelling, thick discharge or pus).Rarely, gentamicin products used in the eye may be absorbed and may cause serious side effects. Tell your doctor right away if you have any serious side effects, including: easy bruising/bleeding, mental/mood changes (such as hallucinations).A very serious allergic reaction to this drug is rare. However, get medical help right away if you notice any symptoms of a serious allergic reaction, including: rash, itching/swelling (especially of the face/tongue/throat), severe dizziness, trouble breathing.This is not a complete list of possible side effects.
