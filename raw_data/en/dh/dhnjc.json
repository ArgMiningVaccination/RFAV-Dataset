However the family of the so-called 'autism hero' insist that Bradstreet's death was not self-inflicted, and have hired a group of private detectives to investigate 'what really happened' to him, after raising over $35,000 online. An expose in [ The Washington Post](http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/07/16/the-mysterious-death-of-a-doctor-who-peddled-autism-cures-to-thousands/?tid=hp_mm) has shown that Bradstreet had been administering thousands of patients with an experimental, expensive and highly-contentious drug called GcMAF - a protein injection - which he claimed could completely cure autism after five months of treatment. The drug has not undergone safety testing, is not approved by the FDA, and experts say there is no evidence to suggest it would have any effect on autism spectrum disorder. But on June 19 - the day Bradstreet authorities said was found dead in Chimney Rock, North Carolina, from a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the chest - it emerged that five children being treated with GcMAF had died in Switzerland. Scroll down for video Mysterious death: Dr James Jeff Bradstreet was peddling an unauthorized and untested 'autism cure' through his Georgia clinic that was linked to the deaths of five children in Europe on the same day he committed suicide, reports say Dr Bradstreet had long been a champion of an unauthorized drug called GcMAF, specifically a brand produced in the UK by Immuno Biotech called First Immune (pictured). On the day Bradstreet was found dead it was revealed that five children in Switzerland being treated with First Immune had died The day before, agents from the FDA and the Georgia Drugs and Narcotics Agency had raided Bradstreet's private practice in Buford and seized vials of GcMAF, medical records, lists of clients, and other documents. They had been tipped off by officials in Britain, who earlier this year closed down a GcMAF lab in Guernsey, in the Channel Islands, That lab, run by [Immuno Biotech](http://immunocentre.eu/), had been producing GcMAF under the brand name First Immune. Bradstreet had been openly distributing First Immune among patients for at least 18 months and even filmed a promotional video for the drug inside the Immuno Biotech lab in Guernsey. However the Medicine and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) - the UK equivalent of the FDA - closed the lab upon raiding it, The Washington Post reported, finding the pharmacy to be unregistered, unlicensed and manufacturing GcMAF using blood plasma that was marked 'not to be administered to humans or used in any drug products'. After his own clinic was raided, Bradstreet fled town. He drove from Georgia to a hotel near Lake Lure in North Carolina. Immuno Biotech CEO David Noakes speaks with Dr James Jeff Bradstreet in a promotional YouTube video about the GcMAF drug called First Immune Around the same time, on June 19, news broke another First Immune clinic, this one in Switzerland, had been closed, following the death of five children, all of which were being treated with the GcMAF drug that Bradstreet had long championed. Swiss officials called it 'an illegal practice of medicine', however it has not been proven that the children died directly from First Immune. Bradstreet's patients had written online they were paying $90 per shot of GcMAF from the doctor, according to The Post. If he had been indicted, Bradstreet would have faced up to 20 years in prison, according to [Forbes](http://www.forbes.com/sites/emilywillingham/2015/07/09/government-search-of-autism-doctor-bradstreets-office-related-to-experimental-autism-treatment/), which first obtained the search warrant the feds used to raid his clinic. The Post reported that Bradstreet could not check in at the hotel when he arrived because his room was not ready, so he left. Hours later his body was found with a gunshot wound to the chest about three miles away in Chimney Rock. A handgun was found nearby. Police reported the death to be a suicide. But Bradstreet's family and supporters continue to cry foul, believing there is much more to the story. Scene: The body of Dr. James Jeffrey Bradstreet was found by fisherman in the Rocky Broad River in Chimney Rock, North Carolina, on June 19 'Jeff dedicated his life's work to finding answers, always pushing the envelope, and never giving up, even at the risk of being perceived as controversial,' wrote his niece, Cali Bradstreet Howell, on a [GoFundMe](http://www.gofundme.com/xscefs) website set up after Bradstreet's death. 'Now, in this moment, we find ourselves in a position, where we too are in search for answers... and we intend on finding them.' The GoFundMe page had raised $34,586 as of Thursday. Bradstreet's Wellness Center in Buford also used a 'mercury toxicity treatment' - among others - as an attempt to cure autism. He believed the heavy metal was a leading factor in the development of childhood autism and that it was supposedly introduced into the body by vaccines. He also published autism research based on the disputed claim vaccines cause autism. The medical community says such claims have been disproved. Dr. Peter Jay Hotez, Dean for the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine, told [The Washington Post ](http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/06/29/anti-vaccine-doctor-behind-dangerous-autism-therapy-found-dead-family-cries-foul/?tid=hp_mm)that this kind of mercury therapy is 'dangerous and without any benefit'. The FDA has warned against such 'chelation therapies', saying they can cause 'life-threatening outcomes'. When the FDA initially raided Bradstreet's clinic on June 18, they refused to explain what the purpose was, the [Gwinnet Daily Post](http://www.gwinnettdailypost.com/news/2015/jun/25/controversial-autism-researcher-jeff-bradstreet/) reported. Bradstreet published autism research based on the disputed claim that vaccines cause autism (stock photo) 'The FDA has yet to reveal why agents searched the office of the doctor, reportedly a former pastor who has been controversial for well over a decade,' the newspaper reported. Bradstreet is from Braselton, Georgia. He went from being a pastor to attending the University of South Florida, where he received a medical degree, and completed his residency at the Wilford Hall USAF Medical Center in Texas. His dedication to autism came after his son was diagnosed with the condition. 'Autism taught me more about medicine than medical school did,' he once said at a conference, [The Epoch Times](http://www.theepochtimes.com/n3/blog/doctor-vaccine-injury-dies-60/) reported. While his family haven't explicitly said they believe he was murdered, his supporters have. 'Self-inflicted? In the chest? I'm not buying this,' one person commented to Fox News, [inforwars.com ](http://www.infowars.com/mysterious-death-body-of-doctor-who-linked-vaccines-to-autism-found-floating-in-river/)reported. 'This was a doctor who had access to pharmaceuticals of all kinds. This was a religious man with a thriving medical practice. Sorry, but this stinks of murder and cover-up.' Bradstreet's clinic was raided by FDA agents with assistance from the Georgia Drugs and Narcotics Agency His body was sent to Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center for an autopsy on June 23 and the case is still under investigation by the Rutherford County Sheriff's Office. The investigator from the sheriff's office, Jamie Keever, said: 'I've talked to some of those people today. 'I don't know what to say. They have a right to their opinion.' Fiona O'Leary of Autistic Rights Together [ [ART](http://autisticrightstogether.ie/)], responded to Bradstreet's death and the call for an investigation into his death. She said: 'While it is very sad to hear of the death of Dr Bradstreet in such tragic circumstances, it is important to consider his position as one of the world's leading practitioners in the field of bio-medical treatments for autism. O'Leary continued: 'Many of these so called 'treatments' are unlicensed and unproven to be of any benefit to autistic people, indeed many can have serious and dangerous side effects on an individual's health and well being. 'Many supporters of Dr Bradstreet and the bio-medical industry are hailing him as a hero, claiming foul play at the hands of the government, yet the truth is more simple perhaps. 'None of the many so called treatments or cures could ever be substantiated and proven to be effective or beneficial outside of the bio-medicals own propaganda machine.'
