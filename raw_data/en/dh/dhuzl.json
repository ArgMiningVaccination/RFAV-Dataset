USDA and its partners established a c ooperative State/Federal Brucel losis Eradication Program more than 50 years ago to eliminate the dis ease from the United States. As a result of this program, all 50 states, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin I slands are considered Brucello sis Class Free. State s are not required to vaccinate against brucellosis. Each State decides whether vacci nation is needed in th eir state although APHIS does encourage it in State s with affected wildlife popula tions - including i n the Greater Yellowstone Area, where B. abortus is still found in wildlife. RB51 Basics In February 1996, the Animal Pla nt Health and Inspection Servic e (APHIS) licensed B. abortus strain RB51 vaccine for use in cattle as part of the cooperative State -Federal Brucellosis Eradication Program. B. abortus strain RB51 is a variati on of the naturally occurring B. abortus wild strain. This genetically stable variation pr oduces antibodies that are diffe rent from the antibodies produced by natural infection. This results in vaccinated animals not test ing positive on traditional brucellosis diagnostic tests. Using RB51 Strain RB51 vaccine must be adm inistered by an accredited veter inarian or by a State or Federal animal health official. Approxi mately 4,000,000 calves are vac cinated annually as part of ongoing efforts to maintain disease freedom. Given that B. abortus is now geographically limited to the Greater Yellowstone Area in wildlife, t he need for routine vaccination of calves has decreased. Strain RB51 is as effective as the previously used B. abortus strain 19 vaccine, and causes fewer abortions in cattle. It is curre ntly licensed for use in non-pr egnant female cattle 4 to 12 months of age. It should not be given to pregna nt cattle as it may induce abor tion. If given according to the label, it does not produce any readily observa ble clinical signs of disea se after vaccination, and does not produce a local vaccination reacti on at the injection site. Vaccinated calves (official calf hood vaccinates) must be identi fied with the standard official USDA vaccination eartag and a vaccina tion tattoo placed in the right ear. The tattoo is c omprised of an \"R\" to distinguish animals vaccinate d with RB51, followed by a shield, and the digit of the last year of vaccination. All vaccinations mus t be recorded on form VS4-26 available at: https://www.aphis.usda.gov/library/forms/pdf/VS_4_26.pdf Sample Brucellosis Tattoo of an animal vaccinated in 2012 2 Booster vaccinations, known as \"a dult vaccinations,\" may be use d as a disease management strategy in areas where B. abortus is endemic in wildlife or in case of an outbreak. Special Considerations Normally, the vaccine strain is cleared from the blood stream w ithin three days of vaccination and is not present in nasal secretions, s aliva, or urine. As a modifie d live vaccine, in rare cases, vaccinated animals may not clear the vaccine promptly and shed the vaccina te strain in milk or other secretions. Because strain RB51 can be shed i n the milk of vaccinated anima ls, all milk or milk products consumed from vaccinated anima ls should be pasteurized for food safety purposes. RB51 vaccine is not considered protective against Brucella suis (Olsen 2010) and therefore is not useful in areas where cattle may be exposed to B. suis. Brucellosis can affect many othe r domestic and wild animal spec ies, as well as humans. If people are exposed to strain RB 51, the disease can be treated by antibioti cs. However, strain RB51 is resistant to rifampin and penicillin. Strain 19 Vaccine B. abortus strain 19 vaccine has not been rem oved from the market or from the Brucellosis Eradication Program at this time. Some States no longer allow vaccination w ith strain 19, and APHIS has been advised that strain 19 vaccine i s no longer being produced. Bison While preliminary studies indicate that RB51 is safe and effica cious in bison calves, the vaccine is not yet licensed for use in bison. In order for RB51 to be conditio nally licensed in bis on, additional safety and efficacy trials must be com pleted. The vaccine is being us ed routinely in the Greater Yellowstone Area in farmed/owned bison. V accinated bison w ill be recognized as official vaccinates provided that the proper vaccination charts and identifica tion are completed as required under the Brucellosis Eradication Uniform Methods and Rules.
