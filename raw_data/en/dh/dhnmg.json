Today's product is the [Aromatherapy Associates : Balance Body Lotion. ](http://www.aromatherapyassociates.com/) This brand is basically from London, started 30 years back. They have a huge variety of products: aroma oils, skin care, bath and body care and much more. When you open the body lotion bottle, you get a nice fragrance of Aloe Vera. This product claims to contain shea butter also to make skin smooth. Well, as per my experience, this lotion is nice. The main advantage is that it is non greasy. The texture is smooth and the lotion is not too runny. It leaves the skin smooth for around 5-6 hours. But I dont think I would but it again as there is no mention of SPF or sun protection, which is important to me. My view: I think you can get good body lotions now with decent SPF protection . So its upto your preference really You can purchase their products from : [http://www.aromatherapyassociates.com/](http://www.aromatherapyassociates.com/) Key Ingredients: HO Wood, Ylang Ylang, Lavender, Aloe Vera, Shea Butter Quantity/Price : 40ml (Gift from a friend) Enjoy "}
