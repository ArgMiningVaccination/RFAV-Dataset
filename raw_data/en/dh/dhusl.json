It happens because of the body's response to a range of different allergens, such as pollution (PM2.5), food, pollen, dust mites, animals, insect stings, medicines and more. An allergy can affect any parts of the body. Allergic rhinitis, for example, affects the eyes and nose, while eczema affects the skin. According to some studies, food allergies normally affect the gut, skin, airways, lungs and sometimes the entire body through the blood vessels. With slightly different underlying factors but still closely related to allergy, conditions like asthma affects the lungs and oesophagus. Allergic reactions Although most reactions are of mild to moderate severity which can be treated with antihistamines, some can have dire consequence and require immediate medical attention. The most severe allergic reactions are known as anaphylaxis. People with known severe allergies should have a contingency plan which normally includes an adrenaline auto-injector in cases of severe reactions. A skin-prick testing or a blood test that checks whether their immune system has produced antibodies to an allergen can be done to confirm whether someone has an allergy. Once a person's adaptive immune system has developed antibodies, it will remember the allergen as a potential threat and hence likely to mount a strong attack on future exposures. Clinical history and test results can account for one's allergy trends. In the case of food allergy, people are given food challenge once determine that the possibility of an allergic reaction is low. An increasing amounts of suspected allergy triggering food are administered to the person while being closely monitored for any signs or symptoms of an allergic reaction. Allergies are becoming more frequent in many countries around the world. According to the Allergy, Asthma and Immunology Association of Thailand, the rate of Thai children with allergies is as high as 30% and about 20% with adults. At present, there are 3-4 more times people suffering from allergies than there were 10 years ago. Admissions into hospitals for anaphylaxis has doubled in the past few years and were several times higher in children under five years old within the same timeline. The trend shows that nowadays children are more susceptible to allergies faster than adults. Possible reasons There are several reason that comes to mind when thinking of the possibilities as to why allergies are on the rise. According to Theconversation.com, here are some theories: - Decreased exposure to infections or microbes - or both - in early life could lead to an increased risk of allergy. This is commonly referred to as the hygiene hypothesis. Research shows that children who have close contact with pets or livestock and those who come from larger families are less likely to develop allergies. - Delayed introduction of allergenic foods, such as eggs and nuts, until later in childhood could also have an impact. Randomised trial for early life peanut consumption in a population at increased risk of developing peanut allergies demonstrated that exposure to the nut early in life is protective against developing the allergy. According to some studies, a child with a nut allergy only has a 20% chance of resolving it by the time reaching adulthood. - Different food preparation methods can also have an impact on allergies and the degree to which they invoke an allergic response. For example, roasting peanuts, greatly increases allergy possibilities while boiling reduces it. - Altered gut bacterial species due to low-fibre diets and widespread antibiotic usage may alter the body's immune function and create an allergy. Whether your allergy improves over time often depends on the type of allergy you have. While we have treatments for the symptoms of allergy, what we need to do as a preventive measure is to get to the root cause. There is no such thing as a prefect test for predicting allergies, unless we expose the person to the suspected allergen. For now, we have Integrative Medicine to assist with the best curative path in managing this and at the same time adjusting the body's immune system. Please find below, some of the available treatments: - Diet therapy helps to reduce the inflammation of the body. In naturopathy medicine, we use natural nutrients as part of our protocol. For example: Omega fatty acid, curcumin extract from turmeric and cassumunar ginger extract, which works extremely well in restraining inflammation caused by allergies. These natural treatments also have less side effects than when treating with steroidal anti-inflammatories. - Checking IgG immunity for food intolerance and refraining from foods that cause allergic reaction, stop allergies or symptoms without having to take antihistamines. - Reducing factors that affect the allergies, especially physical and mentally stress. Stress will cause adrenal fatigue and stimulate inflammation in the body. Refrain from alcohol, smoking, and nightlife. Many people get better when they adjust their way of life or turn to meditation. - Allergostop is a vaccine that reduces allergies and stops the inflammation process naturally. It is done by extracting anti-bodies from the body to make these vaccines and reintroducing them back into the body in order to boost white blood cells for resistance. The anti-bodies are extracted once but will be processed and stored into 25 infusion sessions for immunity treatment continuity. - Adjusting the newly boosted immune system and targeting the problem at source, with the help of the thymus gland. It acts as scanner for the T cell immune system to recognize diseases and at the same time knows the functions of the system. Disorder of the thymus gland will cause the immune system to go haywire. Therefore, attacking the cause by recovering the thymus gland will make allergy a thing of the past. Treatments for allergies are necessary. However, medications might not be the right answer. At Absolute Health we emphasize on treating the problems from the root cause with non-toxic medicaments, lifestyle adjustments and minimizing any possible side effects for the best possible curative path.
