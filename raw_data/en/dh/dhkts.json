The Chiropractor will apply pressure, usually by hand, to the patient's spine in areas where they find dysfunction in order to return normal motion to that segment of the body. The Chiropractor needs to have a clear understanding of the patient's body to ensure they are not going to make the problem worse. This is why Chiropractors study for such a long time at University. To take this into further detail, the way the Chiropractic adjustment works is to improve the input from your body that sends messages to your brain. Instead of your body sending pain or restricted movement signals to your brain we want your spine to send the correct signals to the brain, that show you have a healthy spine. If a part of your spine is not moving very well or has some kind of muscular tightness on one side that is not on the other, it creates stress around the spinal joint and contracts muscles and ligaments in that area. The muscles and ligaments in the area have information signals that they send up into the brain to allow the brain to know how the spine is functioning. If these patterns are altered, then there is less information going from the spine to the brain and this causes more pain. When there is pain and reduced movement in the spine this alters muscle reflexes and can cause muscle tightness in small areas around the brain. This can cause changes to your brain, body and overall wellness. There will also be changes in muscular recruitment. This means that the muscles used to move can be changed by having pain in certain areas of your spine. Chiropractors use the theory that your body is designed in a way that allows for self healing, self regulating and to it develop by itself. For example, your body will heal itself when you have a papercut, your body will produce sweat to cool you down when you are hot. And your body knows how to develop when you are a young child growing into an adult, without you having to think about it. Given these three points are true Chiropractors will therefore believe that if we allow your spine to move properly, which will then send correct signals into your brain then your brain will be able to correctly and efficiently help your body to heal, regulate and develop. To go on further from this, Chiropractors believe that if their care and adjustment is applied to the spine in the correct way then they will be helping that person become better, regardless of how the person feels after the adjustment. This is why some people respond very well to low force Chiropractic and almost feel like nothing has been done at the time of the appointment, but then get great results later on. Other people can feel quite sore after an adjustment by a Chiropractor, but then feel great in the next few days. This is all because your brain is complicated and it's interaction with your body is important. Traditional Chiropractic care is not just to reduce pain and discomfort. It is to improve movement in your spine and to help the aforementioned areas of your spine produce proper signals to your brain to help you function better. The most common reason why people seek traditional Chiropractic care is for lower back pain, neck pain and muscular tension associated with a wide variety of symptoms including headaches or migraines. Chiropractors are also trained in the management and techniques for your head, shoulder, wrists, hips, knees, ankles, elbows and pelvis. This is why Chiropractors undertake a five year degree to learn all of the joints, muscles and tendons in your body, to have a full picture of what is going on in their patients and if they can help. The reason why most people want to get a Chiropractic adjustment is to treat their aches or pains, stiffness is for long-term pain conditions. The Chiropractic adjustment is an effective treatment technique for all ages however traditional Chiropractic care with the popping or clicking noise it's not recommended for children under six years old or adults over 60 years old unless there is good reason for it. For you to get started with a traditional Chiropractic adjustment at Croydon Innate Connection clinic by one of our Chiropractors you first need to have a appointment with one of our Chiropractors to discuss your health goals, and then they can take a medical history and perform a detailed physical exam. The Chiropractor can then decide what kind of imaging if any would suit your particular condition. Chiropractors have traditionally used x-rays for a long period of time, however they are trained to know when to refer for a CT scan or an MRI scan if this would be a better option. At our clinic patients are expected to get any recommended scans so that the Chiropractor has a clear picture of the patient's condition before administering any kind of treatment. During the Chiropractic treatment in our office you will lay face down on the table and the Chiropractor will identify areas of increased pressure or sensitivity. Our Chiropractors are trying to find these areas for you and then deliver small, quick thrusts with her hands to produce a popping noise, which is due to gas being compressed within a joint and a pressure change. There is often little to no pain during this procedure only the uncomfortable feeling of being pushed down into a table. There are risks involved in Chiropractic care. You should make sure your Chiropractor has explained the risks and that you understand them. Your Chiropractor will then let you know what the likely things you are going to feel after the appointment, most likely mild soreness the day after you wake up and sometimes tiredness for a few days after your first adjustment. Your body will eventually get used to these adjustments and will not become sore or tired over time. The Chiropractic adjustment has been around for over 100 years, so if it wasn't working very well it would no longer exist!
