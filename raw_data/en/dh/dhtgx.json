This collaboration marks a major milestone in the energy vertical of the Ocean data ecosystem. Energy Web is the leading decentralized energy ecosystem, trusted by influential energy companies including GE, Tepco and national operators the world over. The Energy Web consortium has more than 100 organizations. EW technology enables any energy asset owned by any customer to participate in any energy market. The Energy Web Chain (EWC) \"is a public, enterprise-grade blockchain platform designed for the energy sector's regulatory, operational, and market needs. Launched in mid-2019, it has become the industry's leading choice as the foundational digital infrastructure on which to build and run blockchain-based decentralized applications (dApps)\" [ [link](https://www.energyweb.org/technology/energy-web-chain/)]. The teams of Ocean and Energy Web have been quietly collaborating since 2017, when both projects were at inception stages. Ocean has contributed to EW's annual Event Horizon conference, for example with this 2019 talk \"Energy Data and Access Management\" [ [slides](https://www.slideshare.net/TrentMcConaghy/energy-data-access-management-with-ocean-protocol)][ [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lC50EARadwo&feature=youtu.be)]. Moreover, both Energy Web and Ocean have long-standing collaborations in the Kusama / Polkadot ecosystems. Ocean and Energy Web have grown up together. EWC is EVM-compatible, which allows it to run Ethereum smart contracts and use Ethereum-style ERC20 tokens. It's currently a [Proof-of-Authority](https://twitter.com/energywebx/status/1051832833579266049?lang=en) chain with a modern consensus algorithm built on [Parity Substrate](https://www.parity.io/technologies/substrate/) technology. This allows it to have low gas fees and low latency compared to Ethereum mainnet. With Ocean deployed to EWC, this means: - Users of [Ocean Market](http://market.oceanprotocol.com)can publish, swap, stake, and consume data assets in EWC. - Data marketplace builders and other dApp developers can use Ocean libraries (ocean.js, ocean.py) and frontend components ( [market](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/market)) with EWC. - Token holders can move their [OCEAN on Ethereum mainnet](https://etherscan.io/token/0x967da4048cd07ab37855c090aaf366e4ce1b9f48)to OCEAN on EWC, and back using [Energy Web Token Bridge](https://bridge.energyweb.org)or the [CarbonSwap OmniBridge](https://bridge.carbonswap.exchange/bridge). Ocean components supported in EWC include: Ocean smart contracts, Ocean Market, Provider (for data services), Aquarius (metadata cache), and Ocean Subgraph (The Graph queries). For more details, visit our [Supported Networks](https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/concepts/networks/#energy-web-chain) page. Cross-chain Mental Model Ocean is now production Energy Web Chain. An [Ocean Market](https://market.oceanprotocol.com) user can click on the network preference in the top right, and toggle which chains they would like to see the assets for. EWC is now in this list and selected by default for all new users. In each of these networks, tokens on the network have real value associated, so there need to be token bridges across networks. For EWC this is: [OCEAN](https://oceanprotocol.com/token)on Ethereum mainnet gets bridged across as OCEAN on EWC. - ETH for gas fees on Ethereum mainnet corresponds to [EWT](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/moonriver)for gas fees on EWC. For dApp developers, as with other networks, in [ocean.js](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/ocean.js) the Energy Web Chain chainId is passed to the ConfigHelper to get all required endpoints for initializing Ocean, while in [ocean.py](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/ocean.py) the respective RPC URL needs to be set as the [network](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/ocean.py/blob/main/READMEs/parameters.md) [ config parameter](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/ocean.py/blob/main/READMEs/parameters.md). Resources on Ocean [CarbonSwap OmniBridge](https://bridge.carbonswap.exchange/bridge) Announcement Statements With the decentralization of energy assets, energy market participants need your data to operate the markets. With Ocean marketplace, you can monetize your data whilst not giving up ownership. Welcome, Ocean, to Energy Web! -Walter Kok, Managing Director of The Lab (EW's innovation hub), former CEO of Energy Web I'm very happy to see this integration of Ocean and Energy Web Foundation. It''s something that both Ocean and EW been dreaming of for years. The world of energy has tons of data; let's unlock that data for the benefit of all. -Trent McConaghy, Founder at Ocean Protocol About Ocean Protocol Ocean Protocol's mission is to kickstart a Web3 Data Economy that reaches the world, giving power back to data owners and enabling people to capture value from data to better our world.
