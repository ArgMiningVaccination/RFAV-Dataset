Recent Submissions - [Sedentary death syndrome is what researchers now call America's second largest threat to public health](/xmlui/handle/10355/10361)(2001)Obesity has doubled, Type 2 diabetes has increased nine-fold, and heart disease remains the number one cause of death for Americans. Sedentary Death Syndrome, or \"SeDS,\" is a growing list of health disorders that are ... - [Cost and Consequences of Sedentary Living: New Battleground for an Old Enemy](/xmlui/handle/10355/10359)(2002)The purpose of this review is to update our earlier review by itemizing, as best we can, the costs and consequences of sedentary living, and thus provide cost reasons to fight a war against sedentary lifestyles. - [Integration of exercise sciences research: Achieving a balance between reductionist versus integrative approaches](/xmlui/handle/10355/10358)(2000)This presentation argues that exercise sciences will badly miss achieving a balance between reductionistic versus integrative approaches under the current NIH plan to reorganize NIH study sections. NIH wants to score ... - [Novel Nanostructured Organosilicate present novel nanostructured organosilicate particulate based films and demonstrate that these materials have a great potential for chemical-biological sensor development. With unprecedented high surface areas (> 1400 ... - [Shock Wave Based Cell Transfection and Fluorescent Organosilicate Nanoparticles for Targeted Drug Delivery [abstract]](/xmlui/handle/10355/6359)(2010)Nanotechnology is a multidisciplinary field that has applications in life sciences, alternative energy, national defense, and electronics. In the field of medicine, nanotechnology may enable intelligent drug delivery using ... - [Development and characterization of fluorescent dye-doped nanoparticles with enhanced fluorescence intensity and doped (DOSNPs) synthesized from poly-methylsilsesquioxane(PMSSQ), resulting high intensity and excellent photostability. The surface ... - [Self-Aligned Microchip Device for Automated Measurement of Quantal Exocytosis [abstract]](/xmlui/handle/10355/6221)(2010-02)Neurons and endocrine cells secrete neurotransmitters and hormones as a method for cell-to-cell communication through the process of exocytosis. Disruption of exocytosis underlie neurological "}
