Alternatively, you can visit a private clinic for: - a travel health risk assessment - advice - other travel vaccines You should arrange a travel health risk assessment 6 to 8 weeks before you travel. This gives time for any vaccines you might need to become fully effective. If your trip is sooner, remember it's never too late to get advice. Preventing risk whilst travelling Vaccines or anti-malarial tablets will not protect against all travel health risks. This means you'll need to take extra measures to protect your health whilst travelling abroad. Further advice on preventing health risks whilst travelling is available on the [fitfortravel website](http://www.fitfortravel.scot.nhs.uk/home.aspx). This includes advice on: Travel vaccines The following travel vaccines are free on the NHS in Scotland: - diphtheria, polio and tetanus (combined booster) - hepatitis A - typhoid - cholera It's likely that you'll have to pay for vaccines against: - yellow fever - Japanese encephalitis - tick-borne encephalitis [rabies](/illnesses-and-conditions/infections-and-poisoning/rabies/) Additionally, you might have to pay for the following vaccines if they're only required for travel purposes: - hepatitis B - meningitis - tuberculosis (TB) Coronavirus (COVID 19) Before booking any travel, check the entry requirements for the country you're going to. You can find this information on the [UK government website](https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice). Before travelling, you must consider that: - some countries may refuse entry to UK travellers if levels of coronavirus (COVID-19) are high in the UK - the UK Foreign Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) may advise against travelling to a country with high levels of coronavirus Information on travelling abroad during the coronavirus pandemic is available on the [fitfortravel website](https://www.fitfortravel.nhs.uk/advice/disease-prevention-advice/covid-19-health-considerations-for-travel#UK).

Please be aware GP practices cannot provide proof of COVID vaccine. Travelling abroad to visit friends and relatives If you're travelling abroad to visit friends or relatives, you may be at higher risk of developing travel-related illnesses like malaria or typhoid. This could be because: - you may be living with the local community - your trip might be longer than the average holiday - you might be visiting more rural areas where it's difficult to take precautions that reduce your risk The fitfortravel website provides information and advice on [visiting friends and family abroad](https://www.fitfortravel.nhs.uk/advice/general-travel-health-advice/visiting-friends-and-relatives). Travel safety advice You can find country-specific safety and security advice through the [UK government website](https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice). Travel insurance advice Many countries don't have the same access to medical treatments as the UK and can be expensive. [Comprehensive travel insurance is therefore strongly recommended for all travellers](https://www.fitfortravel.nhs.uk/advice/general-travel-health-advice/travel-insurance). When you return home If you become unwell and/or develop a fever when you return home, it's important to get medical advice as soon as possible. You should seek medical help even if it's up to 1 month after you've been travelling. Always make sure you tell the health professional that you've recently travelled abroad. This is especially important if you have been to a country where malaria is a risk.
