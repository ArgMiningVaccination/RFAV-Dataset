If you are having trouble with the order process please call me at (918) 948-2758 What is a QRS Mat ? State-of-the-art Quantron Resonance Stimulation system using Pulsed Electromagnetic Field Therapy (PEMF). Pulsed magnetic fields of the earth are natural energies of the earth that help sustain, energize and protect us (from solar winds, cosmic rays, etc). Plus, these energies are ESSENTIAL for life, just like food, water and oxygen. And modern science now has developed PEMF devices that simulate and duplicate the earth's natural PEMF frequencies. But just to be clear, PEMF therapy or any energy medicine device for that matter does not heal or cure disease. What it does is assists the body so it can heal itself. The body is self-healing, self-regulating and self-regenerating and can heal itself if it is given energy and the right elements needed to sustain life This system produces pulsed electromagnetic fields around an individual's body. This field then delivers healing energy to the body by producing negative ions and far infrared waves. Specifically, negative ions directly change cellular signaling and open cell channels, which improve cellular functionality (i.e. more nutrients enter, more waste is removed). Far infrared waves stimulate and strengthen the body's nervous, endocrine, circulatory and lymphatic systems. Widely used in Europe, and growing in popularity across North America, pulsed electromagnetic field therapy has been used for decades by doctors, chiropractors, naturopaths and even veterinarians. In terms of specific health benefits, to date, PEMF therapy has been used to: Decrease pain, Improve post-surgery healing, Treat psychological disorders, Improve sleep, Improve blood circulation, Provide chronic pain relief, Regenerate nerves, Improve wound healing, Improve immunity,, Increase bone density, Improve energy and vitality, Enable relaxation and reduce stress, Eliminate bodily toxins, Help burn calories, improve muscle tone and control weight, Reduce stress and fatigue, Relieve anxiety and promotes relaxation.New studies also point to the possibility that PEMF therapy can help diseases, positively affect cartilage homeostasis, and even increase nitric oxide activity, which is linked to a number of benefits such as: improved memory, stronger immune system, reduced inflammation, increased endurance and strength, improved gastric motility, and more. What do PEMF Sessions do? The PEMF device delivers a series of pulsating magnetic frequencies that creates a penetrating energy that will dynamically interact with cellular metabolism in order to produce a wide range of healing benefits. Those healing benefits to the body are increased ATP production, normalization of cellular membrane potentials, increasing oxygenation of tissues and improved removal of toxins from the cells. What is a PEMF Session like? A PEMF Session will essentially feel relaxing. All that is required of the client is to lie on a massage table that has a PEMF system on it. No action or physical activity is required but complete relaxation is recommended. Afterwards you arise from the therapeutic experience feeling rested, peaceful and energized...minus some aches and pains. In addition to the pad, there is a smaller \"pillow pad\" for application to specific areas. What should I experience during a PEMF session? Since everyone is unique and has different physical problems or conditions, each will experience something different. There are several intensity settings on the device, allowing the individual to increase or decrease the effects. Thus a person can experience many different sensations. Frequently, people will state that they feel a tingling in an area of an old injury, while others say they feel a sense of wellness and relaxation. Check it out for yourself and see what you experience! Who can use PEMF Therapy? Everyone can use PEMF therapy from the very young to the elderly, from sedentary individuals to those that exercise daily. Essentially, anyone at any age group and any level of wellness or fitness can benefit from using this technology while experiencing no negative side effects. How often can I use PEMF Therapy? You can use PEMF therapy as often as you choose. Whether you use it once a day or once a week. PEMF treatment is a safe, easy to use and effective treatment with no negative side effects. Using PEMF just 20-30 minutes per day offers long lasting, significant relief not only throughout the day but throughout the weeks and months, as it mobilizes the body's healing resources. Are there any contraindications to using PEMF Therapy? Yes, there are contraindications for PEMF therapy. It is recommended that individuals who have pacemakers, are pregnant or are epileptic do not use PEMF therapy What are the Health Benefits of using PEMF Therapy? The following is a list of the general health benefits from using PEMF therapy: - Improves recovery from physical exertion, strenuous activities and workouts, etc. - Balances the body's acupuncture meridians in just a few minutes - Strengthens the immune system - gentle magnetic intensity does not over-stimulate the body - Improves wound healing - post-operative wound healing, better scar healing, from injuries, etc. - Positively affects pain reduction resulting from various causes - arthritis, back pain, bursitis, muscle stress, etc. - Normalizes action of the cellular electrical voltage potentials for healthier metabolism. Body Systems: CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: - Strengthens the overall cardiovascular system. - Improves blood circulation and micro-circulation; reduces blood platelet adhesion (stickiness). - Positively influences secondary disorders, such as migraines and tinnitus. - Prevents Thrombosis (blood clots). (Patients using blood thinners must consult with physician before using PEMF therapy.) - Regulates high and low blood pressure; stimulates natural release of Nitric Oxide to relax and expand blood vessels. - Improves blood vessels, improves the cholesterol level, increases the oxygen partial pressure. RESPIRATORY TRACT: - Increases oxygen uptake and reduces respiratory problems and asthma attacks. SKELETAL SYSTEM: - Enhances the healing of muscle injuries from strains, sprains, tendonitis, and bursitis - Osteoporosis - measurable increases in bone density (20-30 percent) after only six months of daily use - Arthritis - reduces pain and inflammation, improves circulation and oxygenation. MUSCLES & TISSUE HEALING: - Enhances the healing of muscle injuries from strains, sprains, tendonitis, and bursitis - Positive effects on Fibromyalgia - not a cure but relieves symptoms with continued use - Speeds post-operative healing of tissues, scars, etc. METABOLISM AND HORMONE SYSTEM: - Improves metabolism functions - Stimulates ATP production to provide more energy for the cells - Moves waste products and toxins out of the cells - Provides positive effects in: Elderly diabetic, Rheumatic disorders, Allergies, Menopausal complaints NERVOUS SYSTEM: - Reduces stress - Provides positive effects in: Nervousness, Burnout Syndrome, Sleeping Disorders The Quantron Resonance System, QRS, was the first pulsed electromagnetic field (PEMF) system in the world. It is also the first to scientifically prove evidence of ion transport, which is an essential factor in producing cell energy. Backed by numerous clinical trials and empirical tests, and three worldwide patents the QRS has the most extensive research done on it of any other PEMF system on the market. The QRS is a result of more than 20 years of fundamental and applied research by leading international scientists in Europe and was first used in the Russian MIR Space Station program. Today, the QRS is designed for home use and is being used in homes and clinics around the world and has been proven safe and effective. Over 80,000 QRS systems have been sold worldwide. Restoring cell functioning By applying the full body mat or small pillow for 8 minutes twice a day, low pulsed magnetic frequencies stimulate cell metabolism, increase oxygen assimilation and accelerate the removal of toxic chemicals and waste. The human body consists of about 50 trillion cells that harmoniously work together. If a small energy deficiency arises in a cell or group of cells, imbalances occur within the body. By creating a resonance similar to those of the body's own cells, the QRS restores cell functioning and penetrates the body, reinforcing weak functional cycles in a natural way. Using extremely low frequency (ELF) programs, which are equivalent to the natural frequencies of the body, for example, the 4 brain states (alpha, beta, theta, and delta), soft tissues, bones, nerves, the heart, and other organs, allows the body to recover its own self-healing capabilities. While in most cases relaxation is an immediate effect of QRS treatment, it does not claim to be a 'quick fix'. Sometimes it takes weeks to months of treatment sessions to enable the body to balance itself. Electromagnetic fields are subtle, though proven to be effective and beneficial to the body. "}
