Did you know the flu vaccine provides good protection from severe symptoms? Or that people with [asthma](http://www.aafa.org/page/asthma.aspx) are at higher risk for more severe flu symptoms or complications? Here are a few answers to the most common questions about the flu. When Is Peak Flu Season? Flu season runs from fall through spring. It usually peaks from December through February. Get your flu vaccine as soon as possible at the beginning of flu season (by the end of October is best) so you can be protected before flu hits your community. Flu vaccines are usually available beginning in September. Is the Flu Vaccine Safe for People With Asthma? Not only is the flu vaccine safe for people with asthma, but it can also be life-saving. Asthma is a chronic disease where the airways are inflamed (swollen). Triggers, such as allergens, pollution, and infections, can cause this swelling. The [flu, also called influenza](http://www.aafa.org/page/influenza-flu-triggers-asthma-complications.aspx), is a lung infection caused by a virus. Many people recover from the flu without problems. But having asthma puts you at risk of serious health problems - called \"complications\" - from the flu, such as pneumonia, a lung infection. People with asthma already have sensitive airways. This means they have a higher chance of serious flu complications and worse asthma symptoms.1 To avoid these complications, it is especially important that people with asthma, and people living with them, get the flu vaccine.2 How Can I Tell the Difference Between the Flu, COVID-19, Asthma, and Allergies? Some symptoms are similar between the flu and other illnesses and conditions. See our chart below to compare symptoms between the flu, a cold, COVID-19, asthma, and allergies. Can I Get the Flu Vaccine and the COVID-19 at the Same Time? Yes! You can get the flu shot and the COVID-19 vaccine at the same time. Is the Nasal Spray Vaccine a Good Choice for People With Asthma? For the 2022-2023 flu season, some people with asthma can get the nasal spray vaccine. Here is what the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America (AAFA) recommends for people with asthma: - Ages 6 months to 4 years should get the flu shot. - Ages 4 to 49: If your asthma is under control with no symptoms, you can get the flu shot or the nasal spray vaccine. - Ages 4 to 49: If you have recent asthma episodes or wheezing, get the flu shot. - Ages 50 and older (whether you have asthma or not): Get the flu shot. Is the Flu Vaccine Safe for People With an Egg Allergy? Yes. If you have a [current or past egg allergy](https://www.kidswithfoodallergies.org/update-egg-allergy-flu-vaccine.aspx), you can get the flu vaccine, even if you have had severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis) to egg. The same is true for children. The following organizations recommend getting the flu vaccine every year, even if you have an egg allergy: - AAFA - Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) - American Academy of Pediatrics - American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology (AAAAI) - American College of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology (ACAAI) The take-home message? The flu vaccine is a critical part of keeping your asthma well-controlled. It could save your life or the life of a loved one with asthma.
