Unlike Western medicine that usually addresses a specific symptom or disease, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) views the entire body in terms of qi, its energy. When qi is flowing smoothly throughout the body, good health is enjoyed. However, if this flow of energy is blocked (ie, from trauma), acupressure can release qi to work toward restoring the body's balance. Qi flows through channels located near the surface of the body. Another name for channels is meridians, or meridian points. There are 12 channels linked to specific organs, such as the liver, heart, and kidneys. Acupoints, or pressure points, are located on the channels (meridians). When precise pressure is exerted onto an acupoint, the gate is opened and qi flows through. Think of qi in terms of blood circulating continually throughout the body to sustain life. If blood flow is blocked or interrupted, the affected part may starve from lack of oxygen and nutrients. The body responds by sending a warning signal in the form of symptoms. Some of these symptoms might include pain, inflammation, muscle spasm, or tingling sensations.
