It is the terminal protein to be added to the assembling virus to complete its assembly process. The P22 virus TSP is also involved in bacteriophage infection by binding to the initial receptor, host lipopolysaccharide. Although all functions of the TSP are of interest, the N-terminal domain (NTD) of the TSP is required for terminal assembly binding. This trimeric TSP NTD takes on a dome-like shape and this dome shape requires three hydrophobic amino acids. The presentation describes how this fact was determined. Biography: Dr. Villafane obtained his bachelor and doctoral degrees from the New York University and his Masters Degree at the University of California at Berkeley. His postdoctoral studies were carried out the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Dr. Villafane is currently Professor of Microbiology at the Alabama State University in Montgomery, Alabama, USA. His laboratory has studied how bacterial viruses and their proteins fold and how they assemble and interact with the cell surface to infect the cell. University of Verona, Italy MHC-I is an heterotrimeric complex composed by HLA-C/2-microglobulin/peptide. The different HLA-C variants can be grouped into stable and unstable clusters based on their binding stability to 2-microglobulin. The presence of unstable HLA-C molecules increases 2-microglobulin release. It is known that patients affected by AIDS Dementia Complex (ADC), a very severe neurological condition of HIV-1 infection, present high level of 2-microglobulin in the cerebrospinal fluid. We observed a higher frequency of unstable HLA-C alleles in ADC patients. We demonstrated that, upon HIV-1 infection, HLA-C molecules associate with HIV-1 virions, increasing viral infectivity. In addition, HIV-1 virions produced in the presence of unstable HLA-C variants are more infectious. We aimed to evaluate how each HLA-C variant affects the ADC onset in HIV-1 infected patients. To assess the contribution of each HLA-C variant in the modulation of HIV-1 infection, CRISPR/Cas9 was used to generate 293T HLA-C-/- packaging cells. The different HLA-C alleles were transfected in 293T HLA-C-/- cells, to develop different cell lines expressing a specific HLA-C allotype. The different cell lines will be used to produce HIV-1 pseudo typed viruses to be tested in infectivity assays conducted on TZm-bl cells. Furthermore, to assign a stability score to each HLA-C variant, based on their dissociation rate from 2-microglobulin, each HLA-C expressing cell line will be treated with an acid wash, to study the kinetic of 2-microglobulin dissociation from HLA-C. These analyses will be fundamental to clarify the relationship between HLA-C binding stability, HIV-1 infection progression and the development of HIV-1 related neurocognitive diseases.

Most common serotypes responsible for the disease in humans are S. typhimurium and S. enteritidis. S. enterica commonly live in astrointestinal tract of farming birds without causing any illness symptoms. However, any damage done to birds intestines during meat processing may result in bacteria spreading onto the meat and also onto the equipment in the abattoir. S. enterica is able to form biofilm on various surfaces, and thus it can be more resistant to different methods of eradication. In our work, we have analysed the formation of biofilms of S. enterica serotypes commonly associated with salmonellosis in different temperatures, under laboratory conditions using crystal violet staining and CFU count. We have also compared the effectiveness of antibiotics, disinfectant and bacteriophages in eradication of biofilms formed by those serotypes under different growth conditions. Moreover, we have analysed the effectiveness of phages and antibiotics against S. enterica in multi-species biofilm in order to compare therapeutic potential of phage therapy as an alternative to antibiotics. We have observed that bacteriophages tended to be equally effective as antibiotics in eradication of S. enterica biofilms formed under laboratory conditions. However, we have noticed that reapplying phages on previously treated biofilm did not cause its further decomposition. Therefore more research need to be conducted in order to evaluate the potential of phages as an alternative treatment of Salmonella-derived biofilms. Biography: Katarzyna Kosznik-Kwanicka, MSc graduated from University of Gdask with a masters degree in biology, specialisation: molecular biology in 2013. From 2013 to 2017 took part in the research regarding the evolution of bacteriophages. Took up PhD studies at the Institute of Biochemistry and Biophysics, Polish Academy of Sciences in October 2017 on the project focusing on comparison of effectiveness of phage preparations and antibiotics in eradication of Salmonella enterica under laboratory conditions and on experimental bird model. Indian Institute of Technology Delhi, India Chikungunya, a mosquito-borne viral disease is now a global public health problem. The chikungunya disease is potentially a global health intimidation and the therapeutic interventions are the immediate necessity. Since, the chikungunya disease has \"sporadic outbreak/ re-emergence\" across the world and hence the immediate potential therapeutics are obligatory. To curtail the virus in outbreak situation, a ready to use drug for chikungunya is necessary. We report the repurposing of approved molecules as an effective anti-chikungunya molecules conferring their antiviral effect validated through many biophysical, biochemical and in-vitro antiviral assays. Through this study we tried the repurposing approach against chikungunya which is a cost and time effective strategy with trust of safety due to continuous human use over time. Through this study, we have shown two approved molecules as an effective antiviral against chikungunya. These molecules were identified using the computational approaches, procured and validated for bimolecular interactions against the recombinantly purified full length nsP2 protein of chikungunya virus using tryptophan fluorescence The KD values as derived from the SPR experiments reported as 1.55\u00b5M and 35 \u00b5M respectively. The anti-protease property of the molecules were assessed by the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) derived protease assay. The half of maximum activity (IC50) and inhibition constant (Ki) for these molecules were found as ~ 1.25 \u00b5M/ 2.27 \u00b10.5 \u00b5M and ~ 2.20 \u00b5M /3.46 \u00b10.3 \u00b5M respectively. Moreover, the molecules displayed an effective suppression of the virus replication in post-treatment antiviral test assays with EC50 values as 20.70 \u00b5M and 48.58 \u00b5M in both molecules.

Center for Public Health Research, Nanjing University, China Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS), an emerging infectious disease caused by a novel phlebovirus, has been on the rise and become a persistent public health threat in the East Asia due to its high fatality. The anti-viral immunity and disease pathogenesis are poorly understood. We reported that defective antibody response to SFTSV was closely associated with disease fatality and a combination of impaired B-cell dependent immunity and T-helper-related cytokines contributed to the global disruption of the anti-viral immunity, characterized by the complete absence of specific IgG response to viral nuclear capsid protein and glycoprotein, the overwhelming expansion and impaired B cell class switch off IgM-secreting plasmablasts, severe apoptosis of monocytes in the early stage of infection, impaired antigen-presentation by myeloid DCs, as well as the impeded differentiation and function of Tfhs with continuous up-regulation of PD-1 expression. Besides, the significant inhibition of IL-4 and GM-CSF both in the serum and in the monocytes exacerbated the pathogenesis of the viral infection. In addition, the SFTSV infection drove macrophage differentiation skewed to M2 phenotype, facilitated virus shedding and resulted in viral spread. We identified miR-146a and b as key regulators in the skewed macrophage differentiation. Further analysis revealed that the elevated miR-146b but not miR-146a was responsible for IL-10 stimulation. We also found that SFTSV increased endogenous miR-146b-induced differentiation of macrophages into M2 cells mediated by viral non-structural protein (NSs).The M2 skewed differentiation of macrophages may have important implication to the pathogenesis of SFTS and the suppressed antiviral IgG response.

This study was conducted to evaluate differences in risk factors, pattern of presentation and DFS and OS between age groups below and above age of 40. Methods: 800 patients <40 years and 3000 patients 40 years were evaluated retrospectively from 2004 to 2018 to assess the differences in (DFS) and (OS) between age groups after adjustment of risk factors like (stage, LN, her2 Neu status and hormonal positivity, KI67) . Results: After median follow up of 39 months, we found that 70% of patients <40 years old were presented with stage III, due to lack of awareness that this cancer could occur in young also due to using of breast sonar only in diagnosis, only 5% have positive family history. When we compared them with older counterparts of >40 years and after stratification of the patients according to: stages, hormonal status and her2 Neu status. There were no significant difference between 2 age groups with regard to DFS P= 0.515 and OS P=0.634. However we found significant difference in the rate of bone metastases progression in young P=0.032 also in local recurrence after breast conserving surgery in patients P= 0.0412 compared to older ones. Conclusion: Patients <40 years exhibited more often of advanced stage compared to patients 40 years, our analysis revealed age<40 years is a real adverse prognostic factor for local recurrence after breast conservative surgery.

School of Life Sciences, Inner Mongolia University, China Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) as a bioactive lipid exhibits a variety of physiological and pathological roles via activation of six types of G-protein-coupled LPA receptors (LPAR1-6). Our preliminary study found that LPAR1 highly expressed in lung cancer tissues compared with paracancerous tissues, but the role of LPAR1 in lung carcinoma is unclear. This study aimed to elucidate the association between LPAR1 and lung tumour behavior at the cellular and animal model levels. We found that LPA promoted the migration, proliferation and colony formation of lung cancer cell line (A549 cell). LPAR1 and LPAR3 preferentially expressed in ONO7300243 (LPAR1 antagonist) completely blocked LPA-induced actions. The results were further verified by experiments in LPAR3 and LPAR1 over expressing A549 cells. Furthermore, the LPAR1 transgenic A549 cell was used in the study related to in vivo tumour-bearing animal model and the mechanism involved in LPA-induced actions. As results, the LPAR1 transgenic A549 cell - derived tumour volume significantly increased in animal model suggesting the LPAR1 is a regulator for in vivo tumour formation. Our results also proved that LPAR1 /Gi Kinases/NF-B pathway involved in LPA-induced oncogenic actions in A549 cell. Thus, targeting of LPAR1 may be a noval strategy for the treatment of lung carcinoma.

This new point of view in all medical specialties stems from the growing awareness of the gender differences with the ultimate aim of ensuring the best care to each person, both male and female, further strengthening the \"patient centrality\" and \"therapies customization\" concepts. Both in international and national cancer clinical trials the stratification is not expected, then this does not allow us to measure differences in the mechanism of action, metabolism, drug effectiveness and potential adverse events in man and woman. The lower women representation compared to men is also a selection bias in itself. Among the oncological pathologies we have selected colorectal cancer because in this pathology the incidence and prevalence data are comparable in both sexes. From the review of colorectal cancer studies conducted from 2000 to 2019 at the ASLBI, Local Health Unit of Biella, the data confirm that men participate more than women in clinical trials: while 57% of the enrolled population are male, 43% female. The same inequality applies to screened and unrolled patients (58.5% over 41.5%). Thus the analysis of the international literature confirms the figure and it stimulates us to deepen the research on the reasons for this difference. Why are women less enrolled than men? Are women more reluctant to enlist? These questions suggest approaching the problem with a new perspective and analyzing both the experimenter and the enlisted subjects psychological aspects, as well as the social context in which the proposal to participate in the studies takes place. Therefore in order to ensure equal opportunities for participation in studies, the gender-specific approach becomes necessary as new evidence suggesting that the effectiveness, tolerability and toxicity of treatments are different depending on gender.

Infection of wildlife ruminants in close contact with infected small ruminants has been proposed to play a role in SRLV epidemiology, but studies are limited. The aim of study was to estimate true prevalence of wildlife ruminants from Poland. Samples originated from 198 wild ruminants, including 142 European red deer and 56 roe deer were serologically tested using multi-epitope recombinant antigens representing subtype A1, A13, B1 and B2 of SRLV and commercial ELISA test. Procedures were carried out with modification allowing detection of IgG in plasma of wildlife ungulates. In the adopted protocols, the conjugate antibody was replaced by the protein G peroxidase-conjugated. True prevalence of SRLV infection in wildlife was calculated, in a Bayesian framework, with models that adjusted for the misclassification of animals because of the imperfect accuracy of the ELISAs and because sera from different species were tested. We chose a Bayesian approach that allowed for the incorporation of prior knowledge by specifying prior distributions for test properties and prevalence. Overall true prevalence ranged from 5.3% (95% CI 0.3, 12.5) to 24.6% (95% CI 3.3, 38.5) for ELISA with multi-epitope antigens while true prevalence using commercial ELISA was only 2.5% (95% CI 0.2, 6.6). These results may suggest existence of new SRLV reservoir in Poland and highlight the importance of surveilling and controlling SRLV infection in domestic and wild ruminants sharing pasture areas. Biography: Dr. Monika Olech works at the Department of Biochemistry in the National Veterinary Research Institute (NVRI) in Pulawy in Poland. In 2014 she received Doctor of Veterinary Medical Science degree. Within last couple of years she was involved in many studies concerning genetic and anitigenic characterization of Small Ruminant Lentiviruses (SRLV) in sheep, goats and wildlife ruminants. The special effort was directed to molecular analysis of field strains of SRLV as results of cross species infection and genetic recombination. 1Basic Medical Sciences Department, Faculty of Medicine, Hashemite University, Jordan 2Departments of Obstetrics & Gynecology, Faculty of Medicine, Hashemite University, Jordan 3Department of Pathology, King Hussein Medical Center, Jordan 4Pathology and Laboratory Medicine Department, King Hussein Cancer Center, Jordan Background: Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is spread worldwide. HPV is the most common Sexually Transmitted Infection (STI), and is closely associated with both cervical and head and neck cancers. In Jordan, the incidence and mortality rate of both malignancies are low. Our studies aimed at determining the prevalence of HPV infection among a subpopulation of healthy women, and its prevalence in a population of head and neck cancer patients in Jordan. Methods: During the period of January 2017 to June 2018, cervical samples from women, and formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) samples from the head and neck were collected to determine the presence of HPV DNA. After DNA extraction HPV infection was detected via PCR using the consensus GP5+/GP6+ and MY09/MY11 primer sets. Genotypes were determined using real-time PCR and reverse line blot assays. Results: Among Jordanian women, 14 out of 348 women tested positive for HPV with a prevalence rate of 4%. The most common genotype was HPV 16 HPV genotypes were (5/14) of infected women, while single HPV genotype infection was seen in 64% (9/14) of the women. High-risk HPV infection was detected in most cases with 78.6% (11/14) infection rate, potential high risk HPV infection was detected in 42.9% (6/14), and low risk HPV infection was detected in 7.1% (1/14) of the women. In head and neck cancer patients HPV DNA was detected in 13 of 65 (20%) samples. HPV 16 was the only genotypes detected. All HPV positive samples originated from tongue or base of tongue. Conclusion: This is the first study in Jordan to report the prevalence of HPV infection among Jordanian women. The prevalence rate of HPV infection in Jordan is the lowest in the Middle East region. On the other hand, a relatively high rate of high-risk HPV infection in SCCs of the head and neck regions was observed.

This cross-sectional study aimed to investigate the prevalence, and the genotypes of HPV infections in the oral cavity, compared to those in the genitals, among males diagnosed with sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in Vietnam. Oral, urinary, penile, and urethral samples were collected from 198 male Vietnamese patients with STIs (median age 31.0 years, range 17-68). HPV DNA was isolated and amplified with PCR, with modified and/or original GP5+/GP6+ primers. Samples were genotyped with a gene array assay and/or population sequencing. HPV DNA was detected in 69 (34.8%) of 198 patients. Of these, 16 patients (8.1%) had infections in the oral cavity and 58 (29.3%) had infections in the genitals (4.5% in the urine, 25.8% in the penis, and 8.1% in the urethra). The concordance of HPV infections between the oral cavity and the genitals was poor (kappa = 0.01). Of the 16 patients with oral HPV DNA, 11 (68.8%) had no HPV DNA in the genitals. In the remaining five patients, HPV DNA was found at both sites, but only one showed similar strains at both sites. In the other four patients, the HPV genotypes were completely discordant between these sites. HPV18 was the most common high-risk HPV genotype in both oral (9/16, 56.3%) and genital (10/58, 17.2%) sites. The low concordance of HPV genotypes between oral and genital infection sites suggested that the acquisition, persistence, and/or clearance of HPV infections were different between these sites.

Department of Pharmacy, The General Hospital of Western Theater Command of PLA, China Viral myocarditis (VMC) refers to the diffuse caused by viral infections or focal myocardial inflammatory cells infiltration and myocardial fiber necrosis or other degenerative diseases, lead to different levels of heart disease and other system damage. The virus that causes VMC mainly intestinal and respiratory viruses, about 50% of coxsackie B group virus, adenovirus, influenza virus, cytomegalovirus, etc all can cause myocarditis.There is no specific treatment in viral myocarditis (VMC), and treatment of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has a certain advantage. Mangiferin, a traditional Chinese medicine, is a major glucoside of xanthone in Anemarrhena rhizome, and has been reported to maintain anti-inflammatory, anti-fibrotic, anti diabetic and anti-viral effects. In vivo and in vitro studies from our latest research indicated mangiferin has definite effect for the treatment of VMC by inhibiting CVB3 reproduction, immune regulation and inhibiting cell apoptosis. In addition, mangiferin can also prevent the process of acute VMC to chronic dilated myocarditis, reduce the expression of white blood cell surface CAR levels, which the expression level of white blood cell surface CAR can be used as a testing index of virus persistent infection. Our research illustrated that TCM has an effect on whole multiple organs and systems, play the role of overall adjustment and avoid the adverse effect, thus TCM has great value on CVB3.

Department of Comparative Biomedical Sciences, Royal Veterinary College, University of London, UK Glioblastoma is a lethal brain cancer with very poor prognosis that activates a number of receptor tyrosine kinase activities driving tumour growth and/or metastasis can be predicted to be inhibited by extracellular Sulf1 and Sulf2 enzymes due to their ability to desulfate heparan sulfate proteoglycans required for RTK ligand receptor interaction. The present study, however, demonstrates marked functional divergence in Sulf1, Sulf2 activities in U251 glioblastoma cells. Our gain and loss of Sulf1/Sulf2 function in U251 cells in the presence and absence of some ligands and their inhibitors show marked diversification of Sulf1 and Sulf2 function in glioblastoma cells. For example, Sulf2 up regulates PDGF cell signaling while full length Sulf1 has little effect, yet shorter inactive variant of Sulf1 fails to exert such effect and thus shows some similarity to Sulf2. This Sulf1/Sulf2 functional distinction is also observed in EGF cell signaling promotion by Sulf2 but not by full length active Sulf1 while shorter inactive variant of Sulf1 promotes both PDGF and EGF cell signaling similar to promotion of both these pathways by Sulf2. This study will describe the role of Sulf1 and Sulf2 enzymes in cell signaling and hypoxia as well as their differential roles in TMZ drug resistance during in vitro growth of some cell lines. Biography: Professor Dhoot graduated from university of London and gained PhD and DSc qualifications from university of Birmingham UK before working on regulation of muscle development and regeneration in the context of muscle nerve interaction. Following the discovery of Sulf1 and Sulf2, her subsequent work has exploited the properties of these enzymes in their ability to regulate cell signaling in both a positive and a negative manner. The Sulf1/Sulf2 mediated cell signaling modulation thus offers the potential to not only improve tissue regeneration but also the potential to inhibit tumour growth in which cell signaling and Sulf1/Sulf2 activities are highly dysregulated. 1Hematology Department, Medical Research Institute, Faculty of Medicine, Alexandria University, Egypt 2Hematology Department, Faculty of Medicine, Alexandria University, Egypt Background: Human organic cationic transporter1 (hOCT1) is a plasma membrane transporter responsible for the main influx of Imatinib into chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cells. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the gene coding for hOCT1 are important factors causing Imatinib resistance. We investigated the frequency of hOCT1 SNP C480G among Egyptian CML patients and its relation to early molecular response as an indicator of treatment outcome. Materials and Methods: Two groups of CML patients were included in this study. Group I consisted of 25 patients responding to Imatinib treatment (Imatinib responsive) and group II consisted of 25 patients resistant to Imatinib (Imatinib resistant). Response criteria were assessed according to the NCCN (National Comprehensive Cancer Network) guidelines 2017. Twenty healthy controls of matched age and sex were also included (group III). For all patients, we studied hOCT1 C480G at initial presentation using Taqman drug metabolism genotyping as well as BCR-ABL percent at diagnosis and after 3 months interval. Results: hOCT1 C480G was present in 32% of studied CML patients. CC (wild) was detected in 68% of group I and 64% of group II. CG (mutant heterozygous) was present in 28% of group I and 36% of group II while GG (mutant homozygous) was detected in only one case in group I. CG was also detected in 15% of control subjects. There was no significant difference between hOCT1 C480G polymorphism and Early Molecular Response = 0.765). Conclusions: hOCT1 C480G polymorphism has no association with Imatinib resistance in Egyptian population. However, further studies on a larger number of patients are still needed to confirm this finding.

Method: We conducted a semi-structured interview aimed at nurses and we administered a questionnaire of 57 items to women who had undergone surgery for breast cancer. Results: 11 nurses were interviewed and 81 women were involved. The majority of women stated that it is extremely important to have complete information during diagnosis, in agreement with the nurses (11/11), who also believed that at the time of diagnosis the woman must receive all the needed information. From the communication of the diagnosis to the end of the treatment, the interviewees have assessed that almost all the needs proposed in 57 items are extremely important with particular reference to clear communication with the professionals, as well as to know, the time that is going to take to get rid of the disease. Conclusions: The transmission of information must respect the cultural background and the global capacity allowing women to participate in decisions that affect their health. Biography: P.

The NF1-related gliomas appear to have a different clinical behaviour compared to the sporadic cases. Patients and methods: Consecutive 60 children with low grade glioma were registered (42 sporadic cases and 18 cases with NF1) were treated. Thirty-nine patients (28 sporadic cases and 11 cases with NF1) underwent exclusive or post-surgical chemotherapy (with a Vincristine /Carboplatin-based regimen). The median follow-up was 5 years and 5 months. Results: Brain MRI allowed the identification of patients with decreased and stable disease (according to RANO criteria). The disease reduction was achieved in 12 of 28 patients (42.8%) among sporadic cases and in 9 of 11 patients (81.8%) among those with NF1, with a statistically significant difference between the two groups (p < 0.05). The response to chemotherapy in both patient groups was not significantly influenced by gender, age, tumour site and histopathology, although the disease reduction occurred more frequently in children under 3 years-old. Conclusions: Our study shows that paediatric patients with low-grade glioma and NF1 are more likely to respond to chemotherapy compared to non-NF1 patients. Biography: Prof. Ruggiero received his medical degree from the Catholic University in Rome in 1992. He holds Board of Pediatrics in 1996 and Board of Pediatric Haematology and Oncology in 1998 at the Catholic University of Rome. He is currently an associate professor in the Department of Pediatrics at the Catholic University of Rome where he is responsible for teaching Pediatrics and Pediatric Hematology and Oncology. Examples of activities include producing guidelines for prevention of healthcare associated treatments and improvements in basic safe medical practices. His research interests focus on pediatric clinical trials, clinical pharmacology of antineoplastic drugs, pain therapy and pediatric drugs. 1Institute of Chemistry, University of Campinas (UNICAMP), Brazil 2Institute of Biosciences, University of Sao Paulo (USP), Brazil 3Boldrini Childrens Hospital, Brazil Information about metabolic changes in cancer cells is known and studied, but studies in younger populations (aged 1 to 19 years) are scarce because they present a group of very peculiar diseases, where genetic differences and mutations are not the primary causes of cancer occurrence. Cancer is already the leading cause of death due to illness among children and adolescents nevertheless around 80% of patients can be cured, if diagnosed early and treated in specialized centers. Most will have good quality of life after adequate treatment, however, the effects of treatments received via chemo- and/or radiotherapy may compromise longevity, since after 20 to 30 years of anticancer treatment, individuals may have recurrence or cancer of another type. Thus, it is necessary to propose follow-up, personalized treatment and diagnosis- early, accurate and robust, which may allow the correct use of chemo- and/or radiotherapy drugs. Three diseases were picked as study targets: (a) nephroblastoma; (b) osteosarcoma and (c) hepatoblastoma. Samples from patients with solid tumors (nephroblastoma and hepatoblastoma) are assessed by semi-solid-state NMR. Also, sera from the same patients and patients suffering from osteosarcoma are assessed by liquid-state NMR. It is expected to verify whether metastatic activity and/or resistance to chemotherapeutic treatment can be observed in tumor tissue and/or serum metabolome and to discover possible candidates for prognostic or therapeutic markers. We hope that early detection, follow-up treatment, as well as, better understanding of altered biochemical pathways may be of great importance in increasing clinical efficacy and anticancer therapy in pediatric malignancies.

We may note chemotherapy, immune therapy, tracers for imaging purposes, supportive parenteral nutrition, antibiotics and more. Our group has chosen to study device-related adverse events during clinical use. Among those are infection and thrombosis. In addition, there might appear unwanted effects from interactions between the catheter material, infused compounds and the tissue during prolonged clinical use. We presently collected data on adverse effects during the first period of treatment with chemotherapy (4 months) of a malignant breast tumor, comparing the use of a subcutaneous venous port (Port-a-Cath) with the use of a PICC-line. We aim to randomize n=250 patients. In addition, we are ageing the same type of catheters in-vitro in a simulation chamber, where chemotherapy is given in accordance to current guidelines. Material analyses are performed on the catheter material and preliminary results show that significant degradation of the catheter material does take place over time1. In other studies, coated central venous catheters (CVC) have been compared to a standard CVC2. We propose that above mentioned interactions and the ageing process of catheter materials have to be taken into account when adverse events during oncology therapy are discussed. References: 1.
