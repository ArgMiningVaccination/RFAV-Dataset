This research area explores the capacity for repair, replacement or renewal of these tissues to enable continued function. Within the Department a range of technologies explore the role of materials (both synthetic and natural) to support tissue replacement, but also the capacity for cells (in particular stem cells) and biologically sourced or biomimetic molecules to support regeneration and repair of tissues. These activities focus on a wide range of applications including implantable neurotechnology (including nerve guides and bionics devices), wound healing, cardiac technologies and prosthetics Academic staff in this area Dr Ben Almquist [](http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/people/b.almquist) Dr Ben Almquist Dr Ben Almquist Bionanotechnology and biomaterials for wound repair and tissue engineering Professor Anthony Bull [](http://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/a.bull) Professor Anthony Bull Professor Anthony Bull Design and development of ligament, cartilage and meniscus replacement tissues Professor Rylie Green [](http://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/rylie.green) Professor Rylie Green Professor Rylie Green Tissue engineered implants for bionics, neurotechnology and cardiac devices Dr Claire Higgins [](http://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/c.higgins) Dr Claire Higgins Dr Claire Higgins Cell therapies for tissue repair, stem cell differentiation, skin and hair follicle regeneration Dr. Jun Ishihara [](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/j.ishihara) Dr. Jun Ishihara Dr. Jun Ishihara Protein design and immuno-engineering for development of new regenerative medicine technologies Dr David Labonte [](http://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/d.labonte) Dr David Labonte Dr David Labonte Fracture mechanics of biological ceramics Dr Huai-Ti Lin [](http://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/h.lin) Dr Huai-Ti Lin Dr Huai-Ti Lin Neuromechanics and bio-inspired technologies Professor James Moore Jr [](http://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/james.moore.jr) Professor James Moore Jr Professor James Moore Jr Cardiovascular and lymphatic biomechanics and device development Dr Naomi Nakayama [](http://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/n.nakayama) Dr Naomi Nakayama Dr Naomi Nakayama Plant regeneration and biomaterials Professor Danny O'Hare [](http://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/d.ohare) Professor Danny O'Hare Professor Danny O'Hare Biocompatible Jorge Hydrogels to promote skin and cartilage regeneration and enable smart drug delivery Dr Tom Ouldridge [](http://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/t.ouldridge) Dr Tom Ouldridge Dr Periklis Pantazis Capturing the dynamics of development and disease through cutting-edge live imaging Professor Molly Stevens [](http://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/m.stevens) Professor Molly Stevens Professor Molly Stevens Stem cells, "}
