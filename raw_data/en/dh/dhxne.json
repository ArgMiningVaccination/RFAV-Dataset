The vaccine efficacy against severe cases of COVID-19 in population aged 18 years old and above is 100% , achieved the secondary efficacy endpoint. uSafety Within 28 days after the second vaccination, placebo group and HB02 group had an AE incidence of 49.01% and 44.90%, respectively. Population aged 60 (29.25%) and above had lower AE incidence than population aged 18-59 (45.22%) after 2 doses of vaccination. Adverse event was mainly concentrated on grade 1 AE , and the grade 3 AE had an incidence of 0.77% . No grade 4 vaccine related AE . uImmunogenicity After 14 days following 2 doses of immunization, the positive seroconversion rate (4 fold growth rate), GMT and GMI neutralizing antibody were 100% , 156.0 and 68.689 respectively, which were significantly higher than those of placebo group. 49uCross-Neutralization Protection Effect of Subject Serum The results of the true virus cross-neutralization test by blindly drawing serum samples from the subjects in this phase III clinical trial showed that, the serum of HB02 groups at 28 days after whole immunization had good cross-neutralization ability with 10 SARS-CoV-2 strains epidemic at domestic and abroad. The positive seroconversion rate of neutralizing antibody in HB02 groups can reach 100%, and there is no significant difference in antibody titers among these strains. The vaccines have extensive cross neutralization reactions to the current domestic and abroad epidemic or representative SARS-CoV-2 Wild Viruses. 505152 lAs of 31 March 2021, AEFI reports from 65.58 million people vaccinated have reactions: 7355 reported (11.22 /100,000) ; fatigue, headache, reactions; 1617 reported (2.47 /100,000) were reported lMost common reactions were allergic rash, other allergic reactions, and urticariallMale 37.4% female 62.58% lAgemajority are 18-59 years old 60 years:79 cases 53 lAs of March 31, 2021, a total of 1,123,413 doses of BIBP COVID-19 vaccine have been administered to people 60 years of age or older in China, 79 cases aged 60 and above were reported lAmong the 79 cases, 35 cases were mainly general reactions, accounting for 44.30%; lFollowed by coincidental events, with a total of 19 cases, accounting for 24.05%; l86% cases have improved or been recovered. lFrom the age distribution, the age of the majority of recipients is concentrated in the range of 60-69 years old: lamong them, the age group of 65-69 years old is the most (30 cases); Followed by 70-74 years old group, with 15 cases in total; lFewer cases were reported in the age group 75 years and above.lThe 79 AEFI cases reported 125 adverse reaction lamong which dizziness was the most, with 23 cases; lFollowed by headache and fatigue, with 9 cases each; lThe terms reported more than 5 cases were nausea (7 cases), fever (6 cases), vomiting (6 cases), allergic dermatitis (6 cases), rash (5 cases), palpitation (5 cases), lthe other AEs reported less than 5 cases; AEFI cases are mainly general reactions, followed by abnormal reactions and coincidental diseases. The known adverse reactions are mainly dizziness, fever, allergic dermatitis, fatigue, etc. The reporting rate of serious adverse reactions is less than 0.1%, which is very rare. To sum up, the safety profile of Covilo-BIBP in this reporting period are basically consistent with the safety data in the package insert, with good benefits/risks.
