Individual vaccine trade names are not identified here. CAS Numbers: Not applicable Other Codes: Approximately 13 GMO vaccines are registered 11 with the USDA/APHIS Center for Veterinary 12 Biologics for use in livestock animals (see Table 13 1). Individual registration codes are not 14 identified. 15 16 Characterization of Petitioned Substance 17 18 Vaccines are administered to livestock species to control infectious diseases, which limit production in 19 animal agriculture and pose disease risk to humans who consume infected animals. Although wild 20 populations are sometimes vaccinated when there is a risk of transmission to humans (e.g., rabies in wild 21 animals), vaccination is more effective in food animals such as pigs, cows, and poultry. Traditional 22 veterinary vaccination involves injection of an inactivated or live (but weakened so as not to cause disease) 23 bacteria or virus strain in addi tion to various adjuvants . The vaccine causes the animal's body to create 24 antibodies (i.e., white blood cells) that are able to recognize bacteria and viruses and kill them, preventing 25 future disease. The creation of antibodies is called humoral immunity. The benefit of live vaccines is that 26 these vacci nes can also trigger cell -mediated immunity, which is required to fight off viruses and bacteria 27 that are able to get inside of host cells, where humoral immunity is ineffective. 28 29 In recent decades, advancements in immunology, biotechnology, and many oth er fields have lead to the 30 development of vaccines produced using genetic engineering technology. Genetic engineering of vaccines 31 includes the process of deleting, adding, or otherwise genetically modifying the viral or bacterial organism 32 used for vaccina tion. These vaccines include live genetically modified vaccines containing live, weakened 33 strains of the disease; genetically modified inactivated or \"killed\" vaccines; and DNA vaccines (containing 34 \"naked\" DNA ). As will be discussed in later sections of this report (see Evaluation Questions #4 and #11, 35 and Additional Questions #5, #6, and #7 ), genetic engineering has been applied to vaccine development to 36 improve upon traditional vaccines in a variety of specific ways . In particular, traditional vaccines have 37 been developed to improve their ability to be tracked in vaccinated animals, reduce viral shedding from 38 animals, increase efficacy against specific diseases, and increase stability during storage and transport. 39 40 Composition of the Substance : 41 42 GMO vaccines are composed of inactivated or weakened viral or bacterial organisms that have had genetic 43 material added, deleted, or otherwise modified. Vaccines may also contain suspending fluids, adjuvants 44 (additives that help stimulate an immune response , most commonly aluminum salts and oil/water mixtures ), 45 stabilizers, preservatives, or other substances to improve shelf -life and effectiveness of the vaccine (CDC, 2011) . 46 Additives in GMO vaccines do not differ from conventional vaccines (OIE, 2010) . 47 48 Technical Evaluation Report Vaccines Made with Genetically M odified Organisms Livestock November 29, 2011 Page 2 of 17 Prop erties of the Substance : 49 50 This report concerns vaccines, which are biological agents with varying physical properties. In general, 51 GMO vaccines are either live or killed pathogens (viral or bacterial) to which specific modifications , 52 additions, or deleti ons have been introduced into the pathogen's genome. Types of GMO vaccines are 53 defined further in Additional Question #1 below. 54 55 Specific Uses of the Substance : 56 57 As described above, vaccines, including GMO vaccines, are administered to livestock species to control 58 infectious diseases. 59 60 Approved Legal Uses of the Substance: 61 62 Under regulations issued by the USDA's National Organic Program (NOP) pursuant to the Organic Food 63 Production Act of 1990, genetic modification is considered an \"excluded method,\" which is generally 64 prohibited from organic production and handling under 7 CFR 205.105(e). However, the prohibition of 65 excluded methods includes an exception for vaccines with the condition that the vaccines are approved in 66 accordance with \u00a7205.600(a) . That is, the vaccines must be included on the List of Allowed and Prohibited 67 Substances (hereafter referred to as the National List) . At present, the National List identifies all vaccines, 68 as a group, as synthetic substances allowed for use in organic livestock prod uction (7 CFR \u00a7205.603(a)(4)) . 69 Vaccines are not individually listed on the National List, but rather are included on as a group of synthetic 70 substances termed \"Biologics \u2014Vaccines ,\" that may be used in organic livestock production (7 CFR 71 \u00a7205 .603(a)(4)) . 72 According to livestock health care standards specified in 7 CFR \u00a7205.238, organic livestock producers must 73 establish and main preventive healthcare practices , including vaccinations. In addition, 7 CFR \u00a7205.238 74 specifies that any animal dru g, other than vaccinations , cannot be administered in the absence of illness . 75 Any animal treated with antibiotics may not be sold, labeled, or represented as an organic (205.238(c)(7)). 76 Livestock vaccines are regulated by the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) 77 Center for Veterinary Biologics under authority of the Virus -Serum -Toxin Act of 1913. In particular, all 78 vaccines used in agricultural animals must be licensed, and vaccines created using biotechnology (i.e., 79 made with G MOs) must adhere to the same standards for traditional vaccines. Specifically, vaccine makers 80 are required to submit a Summary Information Format (SIF) specific to the type of vaccine (Roth and 81 Henderson, 2001). A SIF must present information regarding t he efficacy, safety, and environmental 82 impact of the vaccine being registered. The purpose of the SIF is to characterize the vaccine's potential for, 83 and likelihood of, risk. Occasionally, peer -review panels are formed to complete risk assessment of 84 vacc ines; this was the case for the currently licensed live vector rabies vaccine (to reduce rabies in wildlife). 85 86 Action of the Substance : 87 88 The action of vaccines is described in the Characterization of Petitioned Substance section above. Briefly, 89 most va ccines are injected intramuscularly and once inside the body, cause the immune system to create 90 antibodies (i.e., white blood cells) that upon subsequent exposure, are able to recognize bacteria and 91 viruses and kill them (humoral immunity) . Humoral immunity can be strengthened by cell-medi ated 92 immunity, which involves other types of cells (e.g., \"natural killer cells\") that are able to fight off viruses 93 and bacteria that enter inside of the animal's cells . 94 95 Combinations of the Substance : 96 97 As stated above, v accines may contain suspending fluids, adjuvants, stabilizers, preservatives, or other 98 substances to improve shelf -life and effectiveness of the vaccine (CDC, 2011). In addition, live vector 99 vaccines ( see Additional Question #1 for a definition ) contain two different viral strains, providing 100 immunity for two diseases in one vaccine. Other non-vector vaccines may contain more than one disease 101 strain as well. 102 Technical Evaluation Report Vaccines Made with Genetically M odified Organisms Livestock November 29, 2011 Page 3 of 17 103 Status 104 105 Historic Use : 106 107 Vaccines have been used in humans and animals for several hundreds of years. The first documented use 108 occurred in 1798 when Edward Jenner vaccinated humans with cowpox virus to protect them from 109 smallpox. Vaccines utilizing recombinant gene technology di d not appear on the market until the mid - 110 1980s. Before the introduction of GMO vaccines, substantial portions of food animals were dying due to 111 infectious disease, even with the use of traditional vaccines and other medical treatments. In 1984, 10% of 112 the 45 million cattle and 15% of 94 million swine born that year died of infectious disease (Faras and 113 Muscoplat, 1985). Growth in the veterinary vaccines industry over the past few decades has been 114 primarily the result of new technological advances, drug r esistance by pathogens, and new diseases (Frey, 115 2007) . 116 117 OFPA, USDA Final Rule : 118 119 In general, the use of genetic engineering is prohibited in organic production and handling. Substances, 120 methods, and ingredients that may and may not be used in organic production and handling are defined in 121 7 CFR \u00a7205.105 . Among the provisions of this section is a requirement that organic products must be 122 produced and handled without the use of \"excluded methods ,\" which are defined as follows: 123 124 \"A variety of methods us ed to genetically modify organisms or influence their growth and development by 125 means that are not possible under natural conditions or processes and are not considered compatible with 126 organic production. Such methods include cell fusion, microencapsulatio n and macroencapsulation, and 127 recombinant DNA technology (including gene deletion, gene doubling, introducing a foreign gene, and 128 changing the positions of genes when achieved by recombinant DNA technology). Such methods do not 129 include the use of tradition al breeding, conjugation, fermentation, hybridization, in vitro fertilization, or 130 tissue culture. \" (7 CFR \u00a7205.2 ) 131 132 However, vaccines are specifically excluded (7 CFR \u00a7205.105(e)) from the prohibition of excluded methods, 133 provided that the vaccines are ap proved for use by inclusion on the National List. At present, the National 134 List identifies all vaccines, as a group, as synthetic substances allowed for use in organic livestock 135 production (7 CFR \u00a7205.603(a)(4)). Vaccines are not individually listed and no distinction is made between 136 vaccines made with and without the use of genetic engineering. This has led the NOP to suggest that the 137 NOSB review GMO vaccines as a class of materials according to the provisions at \u00a7206.600(a) (OMRI, 2011). 138 Livestock vaccines also are regulated by the Center for Veterinary Biologics , within USDA's APHIS, under 139 authority of the Virus -Serum -Toxin Act of 1913 . 140 141 International 142 143 The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) regulates veterinary biologics in Canada. Vaccines and 144 vaccine manufacturing facilities are licensed pending an initial evaluation of the vaccine product. The 145 CFIA prepares an environmental assessment for all GMO vaccines that discusses the vaccine's safety to the 146 target animal, non -target animals, humans, and the environment. 147 148 However, GMO vaccines are not allowed in organic agriculture in Canada. The list of permitted 149 substances for organic agriculture indicates that veterinary biologics, including vaccines, may not utilize 150 \"organisms from genetic engineering or their products (e.g., recombinant gene technology)\" (CGSB, 2009). 151 152 According to the Codex Alimentarius Com mission 's guidelines for organic agriculture, \" where specific 153 disease or health problems occur, or may occur, and no alternative permi tted treatment or management 154 practice exists, or, in cases required by law, vaccination of livestock, the use of parasiticides, or therapeutic 155 use of veterinary drugs are permitted.\" The standards do not clarify whether vaccines should be free of 156 Technical Evaluation Report Vaccines Made with Genetically M odified Organisms Livestock November 29, 2011 Page 4 of 17 GMO organ isms; however, it is noted in the guidelines that anything contained in animal feed must be 157 from non -biotechnology -derived sources (Codex Alimentarius Commission, 1999). 158 159 In the previous organic standards in Europe, GMO vaccines were allowed exceptions to the general ban on 160 genetically modified products ( EC No. 2092/91 ). However, the updated EU standards (EC No. 834/2007 161 and 889/2008) do not explicitly discuss GMO vaccines. 162 163 According to the International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements (IFOAM) draft 2010 164 standards, while \"the deliberate use or negligent introduction of genetically engineered organisms or their 165 derivatives is prohibited \" for animals, seeds, fertilizers, and other materials, IFOAM makes an exception 166 for vaccines (IFOAM, 2010) . 167 168 Recombinant technology is generally prohibited in the production of livestock products under the Japan 169 Agricultural Standard (JAS) for Organic Productio n; however, a discussion of vaccines derived with GMO 170 organisms is not prov ided ( JMAFF , 2005 ). 171 172 Evaluation Questions for Substances to be used in Organic Crop or Livestock Production 173 174 Evaluation Question #1: What category in OFPA does this substance fall under: (A) Does the substance 175 contain an active ingredient in any of the following categories: copper and sulfur compounds, toxins 176 derived from bacteria; pheromones, soaps, horticultural oils, fish emulsions, treated seed, vitamins and 177 minerals; livestock paras iticides and medicines and production aids including netting, tree wraps and 178 seals, insect traps, sticky barriers, row covers, and equipment cleansers? (B) Is the substance a synthetic 179 inert ingredient that is not classified by the EPA as inerts of toxico logical concern (i.e., EPA List 4 inerts) 180 (7 U.S.C. \u00a7 6517(c)(1)(B)(ii))? Is the synthetic substance an inert ingredient which is not on EPA List 4, 181 but is exempt from a requirement of a tolerance, per 40 CFR part 180? 182 183 The substance is a medicinal produ ct used to prevent illness in food animals. It does not fall under EPA 184 List 4. 185 186 Evaluation Question #2: Describe the most prevalent processes used to manufacture or formulate the 187 petitioned substance. Further, describe any chemical change that may occu r during manufacture or 188 formulation of the petitioned substance when this substance is extracted from naturally occurring plant, 189 animal, or mineral sources (7 U.S.C. \u00a7 6502 (21)). 190 191 Vaccines are composed of either weakened live or killed pathogens from a va riety of sources. The 192 production process begins when the virus/bacteria are replicated from a \"reference\" organism and grown 193 in a protein growth medium ( viruses are grown on a bovine kidney cell line or in chicken egg s, and 194 bacteria are grown in bioreactors ) in the laboratory (DHHS, 2005). After replication, the pathogens are 195 inactivated, killed, and/or modified, depending upon the vaccine being created. Traditionally, live 196 vaccines are weakened by passing them through the laboratory host system. Alternatively, pathogens can 197 be inactivated using one or more chemicals. Other vaccines are created by extracting and purifying a 198 particular part of the pathogenic organism (CAST , 2008). As explained in the Characterization of 199 Petitioned Substance sect ion above , GMO vaccine production differs from traditional vaccine production in 200 that GMO vaccine organisms are altered by d eleting, adding, or otherwise genetically modifying the 201 bacteria or virus. 202 203 Evaluation Question #3: Is the substance synthetic? Di scuss whether the petitioned substance is 204 formulated or manufactured by a chemical process, or created by naturally occurring biological 205 processes (7 U.S.C. \u00a7 6502 (21) ). 206 207 Yes, vaccines produced using genetically modified organisms are classified as synt hetic. According to the 208 current National List, these vaccines are synthetic substances allowed for use in organic livestock 209 production (7 CFR \u00a7205.603(a)(4)) . While they are derived from naturally -occurring pathogens, vaccines 210 Technical Evaluation Report Vaccines Made with Genetically M odified Organisms Livestock November 29, 2011 Page 5 of 17 are produced by replication in the laboratory. In addition, chemicals may be used to inactivate live 211 pathogens and/or added to the final product for preservative or enhancement purposes (CAST, 2008). 212 213 Evaluation Question #4: Describe the persistence or concentration of the petitioned substance and/or its 214 by-products in the environment ( 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 6518 (m) (2)) . 215 216 GMO vaccines are not expected to persist in the environment any longer than traditional vaccines. CFIA 217 (2007 and 2008a) stated that any pathoge nic bacteria created from gene transfer would be unable to persist 218 in the environment for long periods of time . While viruses or bacteria shed from vaccinated animals may 219 survive in the environment for a short time, the amount of shed pathogen is generall y low and may not be 220 excreted from all vaccinated animals. A safety assessment of a human V. cholera live genetically modified 221 vaccine indicated that the shedding of pathogenic vibri os from GMO vaccine -inoculated patients was 222 considerably less than patien ts administered the non -GMO vaccine strain and that the GMO vaccinated 223 patients shed 106 to 108 times fewer vibrios than those infected with cholera . Furthermore, shedding 224 occurred in only 20 -30% of patients inoculated with the GMO vaccine for a maximum of 7 days (Frey, 225 2007). It is also advantageous that gene -deleted GMO vaccines (e.g., bovine rhinotracheitis, pseudorabies, 226 and classical swine feve r vaccines) can be tracked in the environment, as the survival of the organisms in 227 the animal and the environment can be investigated during GMO strain construction . However, vaccines 228 with inactivated (rather than deleted) pathogens cannot be tracked in t his way because both vaccinated 229 and infected animals will produce the same antibodies against the disease (Frey, 2007). 230 231 Evaluation Question #5: Describe the toxicity and mode of action of the substance and of its 232 breakdown products and any contaminants. Describe the persistence and areas of concentration in the 233 environment of the substance and its breakdown products ( 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 6518 (m) (2)) . 234 235 All vaccines (conventional and GMO) can be shed in the animal's feces and other secretions , although not 236 all anim als will shed vaccine DNA . This shed DNA could potentially infect other animals and spread the 237 virus or bacteria in the environment. However, as discussed in Evaluation Question #4, vaccines cannot 238 survive in the environment for long periods of time. Va ccines contain aluminum salts and other chemical 239 adjuvants or additives; however, it is unclear if these substances are released in high quantities or whether 240 they may impact the environment. Moreover , for both conventional and GMO vaccines, regulatory 241 authorities consider additives when licensing them, establishing residue limits and withdrawal periods 242 (required time between vaccination and slaughtering or milking) when necessary (OIE, 2010) . 243 244 Evaluation Question #6: Describe any environmental contaminat ion that could result from the 245 petitioned substance's manufacture, use, misuse, or disposal ( 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 6518 (m) (3)) . 246 247 Although accidental spills may occur during vaccination and some environmental contamination may 248 occur during proper use (e.g., in coarse spray vaccine administration), a s discussed in Evaluation Question 249 #4, extensive contamination of the environment with vaccine organisms is not anticipated due to low rates 250 of shedding and the low survival rate of many pathogens in the environment ( CFIA 2007 and 2008a). If 251 manufacturers/livestock farmers do not correctly dispose of unused or expired vaccine materials, there is a 252 potential for contamination of the environment with vaccine additives such as mercury -containing 253 thimerosal (MDH, 2011). The impact of this contamination would depend on the specific circumstances of 254 the manufacturing process or disposal. 255 256 Evaluation Question #7: Describe any known chemical interactions between the petitioned substance 257 and other substances used in organic crop or livestock production or handling. Describe any 258 environmental or human health effects from these chemical interactions ( 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 6518 (m) (1)) . 259 260 Vaccine additives may interact with other additives/adjuvants ; however, r eactions are limited due to the 261 generally small amounts of chemical constituents present in vaccines. Furthermore, preservative /adjuvant 262 combinations such as thimerosal and aluminum salts are common, and generally any vaccines causing 263 adverse reactions would not be allowed on the market unless risks were mitigated (Roth and Henderson, 264 2001) . 265 266 Technical Evaluation Report Vaccines Made with Genetically M odified Organisms Livestock November 29, 2011 Page 6 of 17 Because some vaccines (e.g., influenza and yellow fever vaccines ) are produced with egg products, people 267 with allergies may have allergic reactions to them ( CDC, 2011). For the same reason , additives in livestock 268 vaccines could cause allergic reactions in inoculated animals ; however, these reactions should not differ 269 based on the vaccine's status as GMO or conventional . 270 271 Vaccines may also interact with each other (termed \"vaccine -vaccine interactions\") , which c an reduce the 272 efficacy of one or both vaccines or cause adverse effects. Otto et al. (2007) studied the possibl e interactions 273 between Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) and meningococcal group C (MenC) con jugate vaccines , used 274 in humans; results indicated that the two vaccines did not degrade each other or induce significant 275 interactions (Otto et al., 2007). Studies on the other potential vaccine -vaccine interactions involving GMO 276 vaccines have not been i dentified. 277 278 Evaluation Question #8: Describe any effects of the petitioned substance on biological or chemical 279 interactions in the agro -ecosystem, including physiological effects on soil organisms (including the salt 280 index and solubility of the soil) crop s, and livestock ( 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 6518 (m) (5)) . 281 282 GMO vaccines are meant to improve immunity to disease in vaccinated livestock animals. There are 283 vaccines that are used to control reproduction (Meeusen et al., 2007), but these should be evaluated 284 separately from vaccines intended to control disease. 285 286 All vaccines, inc luding GMO vaccines, can cause unwanted side effects in vaccinated animals including 287 swelling and irritation at the site of injection, fever, coughing (after nasal administration), respiratory 288 distress, and reduced fertility (Morton, 2007). However, there is no difference in these symptoms between 289 GMO and traditional vaccines, and all vaccines are evaluated for side effects by manufacturers. 290 291 Evaluation Question #9: Discuss and summarize findings on whether the petitioned substance may be 292 harmful to the environment ( 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 6517 (c) (1) (A) (i) and U.S.C. \u00a7 6517 (c) (2) (A) (i)) . 293 294 Because live vaccine pathogens cannot survive long outside of a host, environmental damage is not 295 expected from accidental release or shedding from vaccinated animals. Furthermore, although there is a 296 possibility that non -target species in close proximity to vaccinated animals may become infected with 297 pathogens from vaccine shedding, studies have indicated that this has not been a problem historically. 298 Once again, the abil ity for the pathogen to spread is limited by its short lifespan in the environment. In 299 addition, some GMO vaccines have been tested in non -target species (e.g., the GMO Salmonella typhurium 300 vaccine in rats, mice, calves, and pigs) and have not shown to ad versely affect these species (CFIA, 2006). 301 302 Evaluation Question #10: Describe and summarize any reported effects upon human health from use of 303 the petitioned substance (7 U.S.C. \u00a7 6517 (c) (1) (A) (i), 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 (c) (2) (A) (i)) and 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 6518 304 (m) (4)) . 305 306 Regulators have noted that farmers or vaccine applicators could become infected during care of vaccinated 307 animals that shed viral or bacterial organisms (CFIA, 2007 and 2008a) . However, many of the disease s for 308 which food animals are vaccinat ed cannot reproduce in either the target animal or human s (CFIA, 2007 and 309 2008a). For example, the vector for the porcine circovirus vaccine is Baculovirus, which is an insect virus 310 not associated with disease in humans or animals. Risk assessments for G MO vaccines conducted by the 311 Canadia n Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) predicted that human health effects in workers would be 312 minimal, as long as handlers took the necessary safety precautions to protect themselves (e.g., safety 313 equipment such as gloves). 314 315 Some r egulators and scientists have questioned whether the meat from GMO vaccinated animals may be 316 harmful to humans who consume it (CFIA, 2006; Tr aavik, 1999) . This issue is examined before licensure of 317 a GMO vaccine. For example, the risk assessment report from the CFIA (2006) indicates that the Salmonella 318 typhurium vaccine (live culture GMO vaccine) has a low health risk to humans exposed through spills or 319 shedding by vaccinated animals. The vaccine strain is entirely eliminated before the broiler c hickens are 320 sold, so salmonella exposure to humans consuming vaccinated animals is unlikely. If any viral DNA is left 321 Technical Evaluation Report Vaccines Made with Genetically M odified Organisms Livestock November 29, 2011 Page 7 of 17 in meat from vaccinated animals, it is expected to be broken down in the human gastrointestinal tract, thus, 322 health problems are not anti cipated from consumption (CFIA, 2010). 323 324 Evaluation Question #11: Descr ibe all natural (non -synthetic) substances or products which may be 325 used in place of a petitioned substance ( 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 6517 (c) (1) (A) (ii)) . Provide a list of allowed 326 substances that may be used in place of the petitioned substance (7 U.S.C. \u00a7 6518 (m) (6)) . 327 328 Organic livestock producers may choose between traditional and GMO vaccines when treating for most 329 diseases (See the \" OFPA, USDA Final Rule \" section above for further discussion of the regulatory status of 330 traditional and GMO vaccines.) However, there are some disease s or combinations of diseases for which a 331 GMO vaccine is the only available product (Foley, 2011). For example, there is no c onventional Avian 332 salmonellosis vaccine and there is no conventional combination vaccine for Fowl Pox and Mycoplasma 333 Gallisepticum (note that there are conventional vaccines available for the two diseases separately) (USDA, 334 2011). In addition, the number of available GMO vaccines and conventional vaccines vary with time due to 335 new license issues and previous license terminations on an ongoing basis. It should also be noted that 336 GMO vaccines are sometimes safer, and often more efficacious and cheaper than their traditional 337 counterparts (Shams, 2005; see Additional Question #7 ). 338 339 Homeopathic remedies may also be used to supplement or replace vaccines. For example, nosodes are a 340 homeopathic remedy made from a pathological product (e.g., blood, saliva, or diseased tissue) that are 341 administered orally (ECCH, 2008 ). Nosodes act similar ly to vaccines by facilitating natural resistance 342 mechanisms and increasing the cure rate of existing infections in animals. However, some studies have 343 indicated that nosodes are not highly efficacious in preventing disease (McCroy and Barlow, in Morris and 344 Keilty, 2006). Natural herbal supplements like dandelion and chicory may also be used, but these are 345 usually used to treat infection once it occurs, rather than to prevent infection (Morris and Keilty, 2006 ). 346 347 Evaluation Question #12: Describe any al ternative practices that would make the use of the petitioned 348 substance unnecessary ( 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 6518 (m) (6)) . 349 350 Vaccines are an integral part of animal agriculture to prevent disease and animal suffering (Morton, 2007) . 351 It is unlikely that homeopathic or other methods would render vaccinations unnecessary. However, as 352 explained in Evaluation Question #11 , many traditional vaccines can be used in place of GMO vaccines for 353 common diseases. 354 355 Additional Evaluation Questions for GMO Vaccines Used in Livestock 356 357 Additional Question #1 . What constitutes a GMO vaccine; i.e., are there different levels of GMO use 358 that could determine if a vaccine is labeled GMO? 359 GMO (genetically modified organism ; also commonly referred to as genetically modified [GM] or 360 genetically engineered [GE]) vaccines include all of those vaccines in which specific modifications , 361 additions, or deletions are introduced into the viral or bacterial genome. These vaccines can be made of 362 either live or killed pathogens. Specific types of GMO vaccines include: 363 364 Gene -deleted vaccines have a gene deleted or inactivated. Marker vaccines are a type of gene - 365 deleted vaccine that allow differentiation from field strains for diagnostic purposes ( e.g., foot and 366 mouth disease vaccines), 367 368 Subuni t vaccines from isolated genes , which contain only part of the virus' or bacteria's DNA 369 (e.g., the vaccine for post -weaning multisyste mic wasting syndrome in swine), including c himeric 370 virus vaccines , which combine parts of genes from more than one type of virus (examples: recently 371 developed poultry avian influenza vaccine), 372 373 Vector vaccines contain live virus or bacteria strains that have been injected with a protective gene 374 from another disease agent. T hese vaccines protect against both the host virus/bacteria and the 375 injected virus/bacteria, 376 Technical Evaluation Report Vaccines Made with Genetically M odified Organisms Livestock November 29, 2011 Page 8 of 17 377 DNA vaccines are made up of \"naked\" DNA (in other words, the DNA has been removed from 378 the bacterial or viral organism), which is directly injected into the anima l (not currently used for 379 livestock animals). 380 381 A 2010 report by the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE), the Food and Agriculture Organization 382 (FAO), and the World Health Organization (WHO) suggested that animals vaccinated with GM O vaccines 383 should not be considered GM animals (OIE, 2010). Further, they clarified the difference between GM foods 384 and the use of GM O vaccines. With engineered foods, the intention is to introduce a new trait into a food; 385 this trait will be present in the food eaten by t he consumer. On the other hand, the intention of genetically 386 modified vaccines is to introduce into food animals \"a protective immune response by means of an 387 immunogen that is often no longer itself present at the time the animal is slaughtered.\" However , OIE 388 noted that this is a generalization and there may be exceptions. It recommended that e ach vaccine should 389 be evaluated independently for risk. 390 391 There do not appear to be different \"levels\" of GMO use in vaccines; all examples described above use 392 some form of genetic engineering. 393 394 Additional Question #2 . Are there [livestock] diseases that are only covered with GMO vaccines? 395 396 Yes. According to sources at the USDA Center for Veterinary Biologics (Foley, 2011), a GMO vaccine is the 397 only option available for some diseases or combinations of diseases in food animals. For other diseases, 398 conventional and GMO vaccines are available. However, the number of available GMO and conventional 399 vaccines vary with time due to new license s and previous licen se terminations on an ongoing basis. See 400 Additional Question #3 for more information. 401 402 Additional Question #3 . What is the proportion of GMO/non -GMO vaccines currently available [for 403 livestock]? 404 405 According to the USDA Center for Veterinary Biologics (20 10) and Foley (2011), approximately 73 vaccines 406 are licensed for use in wild and domesticated animals as of September, 2010. Of these, 28 are GMO 407 vaccines (about 39%) and 13 (about 18%) are given to livestock animals (e.g., the Escherichia Coli bacterin - 408 toxoid for neonatal diarrhea in swine and the Newcastle disease -fowl pox vaccine with live fowl pox vector 409 for use in poultry). B ecause organic certifying agents generally do not consider GMO status, no data are 410 available on how many GMO vaccines are being used in organic production at this time. However, Frey 411 (2007) stated that conventional , non -GMO live bacterial vaccines are still used extensively and that GMO 412 live bacterial vaccines are still very rare in veterinary medic ine (Frey, 2007). GM viral vaccines are more 413 prevalent than GM bacterial vaccines, although there remain many conventional viral vaccines.

Are there effective alternative(s) to GMO vaccines, such as a combination of 420 conventionally produced vaccines, nosodes, etc.? 421 422 According to the European ical Homeopathy (ECCH), nosodes are \"h omeopathic 423 remedies of biological origin that are derived from pathologically modified organs or parts of organs that 424 are of human or animal origin, or from cultured micro -organisms that have been killed, or from produ cts 425 of the decomposition of animal organs, or from body liquids containing pathogen s or pathological 426 products \" (ECCH, 2008) . Nosodes act similarly to vaccines by facilitating natural resistance mechanisms 427 Technical Evaluation Report Vaccines Made with Genetically M odified Organisms Livestock November 29, 2011 Page 10 of 17 and increasing the cure rate of existing infections in animals. Nosodes have been used to treat bovine 428 mastitis, or inflammation of the mammary glands, in dairy cows. This condition is usually caused by 429 bacteri a entering the udder. Vaccines have been s hown to be ineffective in preventing most cases of 430 mastitis. However, E. Coli J-5 vaccine for E-Coli-caused mastitis can decrease the severity of the condition 431 (McCroy and Barlow, in Morris and Keilty, 2006). In a randomized study by McCroy and Barlow 432 (performed in 1997, reported in 2006), over 1,000 cows and 300 calves were studied for the effect of nosodes 433 on bovine mastitis and calf scour (diarrhea). The authors reported that the treatment with nosodes did not 434 alter the incidence in new cases of masti tis, compared to controls. Authors did not investigate how 435 nosodes affected severity of mastitis infection. In addition, the E. coli nosodes did not reduce the incidence 436 of scour in calves (McCroy and Barlow, in Morris and Keilty, 2006). This report ind icates that nosodes 437 alone were not effective in reducing the incidence of mastitis or calf scour in the population studied. 438 439 However, nosodes may be more effective if combined with conventional vaccines or if other homeopathic 440 remedies are used. A study by Werner et al. (2010) found no difference between the cure rates of 441 homeopathic treatments versus antibiotic treatments (allowed in conventional livestock only) for mild to 442 moderate mastisis at the end of a 56 -day treatment period. However, authors rep orted that the 443 homeopathic remedy significantly increased the cure rate compared to placebo treatments. The antibiotic 444 treatment consisted of cloxacillin followed by cefquinom and the homeopathic treatments were tailored to 445 the treated animals based on th eir symptoms and included oral doses of Phytolacca decandra (poke root) , 446 (made from honey bees). 448 Despite the improvements compared to placebo -treated animals, authors noted that both home opathic and 449 antibiotic treatments had a relatively low cure rate, suggesting low efficacy for these two treatments 450 (Werner et al., 2010). 451 452 No oth er nosodes or homeopathic remedies were identified for use in food animals. 453 454 Additional Question #5 . Studies on the potential harm from the use of GMO vaccines. 455 456 Studies concerning the potential harm from GMO vaccines are described below. It is important to note that 457 there are various forms of GMO vaccines with different safety concerns; each vaccine has its own safety 458 considerations as well. For example, many GMO vaccines , including live canarypox vector vaccines in 459 horses and live Marek's disease vector vaccines in chickens, are derived from existing disease strains that 460 have been used in conventional vaccination for a long period of time. A record of safe use of the disease 461 strain in the past improves the expected safety of the genetically modified version of the vaccine (OIE, 462 2010). 463 464 One of the concerns commonly expressed over the safety of GMO vaccines is the possibility that the non - 465 pathogenic (not able to cause disease) strain present in the vaccine may mutate or combine with other 466 genes to become pathogenic (virulent; disease -causing) after administration (Traavik, 1999; Roth and 467 Henderson, 2001) . While this can happen with both conventional and genetical ly modified vaccines , the 468 likelihood depends upon the type and the specific characteristics of the vaccine (see below) . With bacterial 469 GMO vaccines (which are predominantly administered via the mouth), there are concerns that the 470 engineered bacteria may r ecombine with natural bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract. Furthermore, it is 471 unclear how long the altered virus/bacteria will remain in the vaccinated animal (Traavik, 1999). 472 473 Another general concern for GMO vaccines made from live virus or bacteria is the shedding of DNA from 474 vaccinated animals. All vaccines (conventional and GMO) can be shed in the animal's feces and other 475 secretions , although not all animals will shed vaccin e DNA . This shed DNA could potentially infect other 476 animals and spread the virus or bacteria. Theoretically, shed viral DNA in the environment may 477 recombine with naturally occurring viruses, forming altered virus strains with unpredictable 478 characteristic s. The biological and ecological consequences of such changes are difficult to predict, but 479 could be harmful (Traavik, 1999). However, with GMO vaccines, it is possible to locate the mobile, active 480 gene elements needed to cause disease and delete or inac tivate them. For example, with the cholera 481 vaccine V. cholerae CVD 103 -HgR, developers deleted 95% of both chromosomal copies of the ctxA gene, 482 Technical Evaluation Report Vaccines Made with Genetically M odified Organisms Livestock November 29, 2011 Page 11 of 17 which is responsible for its toxicity. The advantage to pathogen gene deletion is that it decreases the 483 likeli hood of gene transfer from live vaccine to other organisms (Frey, 2007). Risk assessment during strain 484 construction should consider these factors and each vaccine's ability to be traced in the environment. 485 Below is a summary of potential advantages, disa dvantages, and safety concerns for each of the major 486 GMO vaccine types. 487 488 Gene -deleted Vaccines 489 490 Gene -deleted vaccines made from live or killed virus are created using organisms that have had specific 491 gene(s) deleted or rendered inactive. The development of these vaccines means that the genetic basis for 492 reduced virulence is understood, which allows researchers to predict and /or monitor the ability of the 493 vaccine to revert to virulence. Like subunit vaccines, genes that induce i mmune suppression or 494 hypersensitivity to the vaccine can be deleted, improving vaccine safety. Gene -deleted vaccines are also 495 used for the production of marker vaccines, which allow for the identification of animals that have been 496 vaccinated. Gene -deleted vaccines and companion diagnostic tests have been developed for pseudorabies 497 virus in swine, bovine herpes virus I in cattle, and classical swine fever virus (hog cholera). Although 498 gene -deleted vaccines may interact with the virulent organism in the animal, thus restor ing the disease - 499 causing ability of the organism, the genetically modified organism should not be any more virulent or 500 pathogenic than the strain found in the e nvironment. The exception is if two gene -deleted organisms in the 501 same animal recombine to form a disease strain the animal did not previously have. This emphasizes the 502 need to have the same deletion in all gene -deleted vaccines for a specific organism ( Roth and Henderson, 503 2001). 504 505 Subunit Vaccines 506 507 Subunit vaccines contain only a portion of the infectious, disease -causing agent (e.g., only parts of a virus' 508 proteins) . Roth and Henderson (2001) indicate that these vaccines are relatively safe, efficient, and 509 inexpensive. An important advantage is the ability to remove or weaken the immunological gene 510 processes that cause hypersensitivity reactions to the vaccine. Disadvantages of subunit va ccines include 511 limited immune protection because these vaccines o nly express a few antigens1. Subunit vaccines also 512 require the use of adjuvants, or additives, to increase the immune response. Use of adjuvants can result in 513 a higher likelihood of adverse reaction to the vaccine. 514 515 Live Vector Vaccines 516 517 Live vectored vaccines are produced by placing genes that code for a protective antigen into another 518 organism (the vector); this organism then replicates (makes copies) and express es the antigen in the 519 vaccinated animal . These vaccines have been developed for viruses and bacteria. One of the most 520 important advantages is the ability to administer live vectored vaccines through the nose (intranasally) or 521 in the mouth (intraorally) rather than by injection under the skin, as is done for most vaccines. Vectored 522 vaccines contain pathogens that have had their genetic material deleted or inactivated . They do not have 523 the potential, like conventional modified vaccines do, to revert to virulence or cause disease in vaccinated 524 animals with suppressed immune system s. Live vector vaccines may also be able to overcome the 525 interference with immune response caused by the maternal antibodies young animals inherit from their 526 mother (a difficult task for many pathogens). Roth and Henderson (2001) emphasize that live vect ored 527 vaccines must be engineered without the use of markers (strands of DNA) that are resistant to antibiotics in 528 the vaccine organism. These resistant organisms are commonly used in helping to select organisms to use 529 as vaccine vectors, but they could re duce the efficacy of antibiotics used to treat illness. Licensed viral 530 vector vaccines include a rabies vaccine (with a vaccina virus vector) and Newcastle disease vaccine (with a 531 fowl pox vector). 532 533 1 Any substance that stimulates an immune response in the body (especially the production of antibodies) Technical Evaluation Report Vaccines Made with Genetically M odified Organisms Livestock November 29, 2011 Page 12 of 17 DNA Vaccines 534 535 DNA vaccines consisting of purified recombinant DNA (artificial DNA created by combining several 536 sequences of DNA) are somewhat different than other GM vaccines. Only a few live DNA vaccines have 537 been formulated, and so far none are registered for food animals. It is difficult to illicit the same immune 538 response in all animals given DNA vaccines (Roth and Henderson , 2001). The OIE concluded that these 539 vaccines would not pose a significant food safety risk if used, as only low amounts of administered DNA 540 would be present in vaccinated anima ls at the time of slaughter and any DNA left in the tissue would be 541 rapidly degraded during digestion (OIE, 2010). Furthermore, these vaccines cannot revert to vi rulence nor 542 become virulent in animals with suppressed immune systems that are given the vacc ine (Roth and 543 Henderson , 2001). Howe ver, there is some concern that DNA from these vaccine s may integrate into a 544 host's chromosomes and initiate a cancer -initiating event, although results have been negative in 545 experiments thus far (European Commission, 1999) . In addition, the modified DNA could theoretically 546 integrate into the sperm or egg cells and be passed on to future generations. 547 548 Case Studies of Select GMO Vaccines Currently Licensed in the United States 549 550 The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA ) has posted online a number of risk assessments of GMO 551 vaccines performed by the agency for the purpose of licensing. The following is a summary of the safety 552 concerns covered in the assessment of a live vector vaccine for laryngotracheitis -Marek's disea se (serotype 553 3; Marek's disease vector). This vaccine has been licensed in the U.S. since 2007. 554 555 Fowl laryngotacheitis is a contagious respiratory disease mainly infecting chickens in commercial layer and 556 broiler flocks. Marek's disease is a widespread viral, cancer -causing disease of poultry, which is difficult to 557 remove once flocks have become infected because it spreads easily and quickly. Vaccination does not 558 prevent the disease, but reduces shedding and thus spread of the virus. 559 560 CFIA (2010) discus sed the theoretical risk of horizontal gene transfer (when an organism incorporates 561 genetic material from another organism) of this particular vaccine, saying that the risk was low based on 562 existing in vitro and in vivo data. Furthermore, the risk of reco mbination of the virus, allowing it to 563 become virulent again, was considered low, based on other studies of similar viruses (not cited). CFIA 564 (2010) also reported that in vivo studies conducted by the manufacturer indicated that the virus could not 565 replic ate in any other avian species besides chickens and turkeys, and that there was no transmission of the 566 GMO between vaccinated and unvaccinated chickens. Shedding of the GMO would be mostly contained 567 to the indoor environments of the chickens, although ris k from accidental spills and release of vented air 568 may allow for some spread of the GMO to the outdoor environment. 569 570 In considering the safety of the GMO vaccine for humans, CFIA (2010) evaluated the potential for exposure 571 to humans through consumption of the meat of vaccinated birds. Exposure would be low because the 572 virus is localized to visceral organs and feather follicles, which are not commonly consumed. In addition, 573 any trace amounts of viral DNA present in the consumed meat would be digested in th e gastrointestinal 574 tract. Any exposure that did occur was not expected to cause adverse human health effects. The report 575 concluded that no significant public health issues were expected to result from widespread use of the 576 vaccine. 577 578 The CFIA has performe d similar risk assessments for the Salmonella typhurium vaccine (live culture); the 579 porcine circovirus 2 chimera (killed virus); vaccine type killed - disease vector; 581 and the Escherichia coli live culture vaccine. 582 583 The Salmonella typhurium vaccine (live culture) is used for immunization of healthy chickens in order to 584 reduce the colonization of Salmonella typhurium bacteria in internal organs. The report from the CFIA 585 (2006) indicates that the vaccine has a low health risk to humans exposed through spills or shedding by 586 vaccinated animals. The vaccine strain is entirely eliminated before the broiler chickens are sold, so 587 salmonella exposure to humans consuming vaccinated animals is unlikely. Studies also show that 588 Technical Evaluation Report Vaccines Made with Genetically M odified Organisms Livestock November 29, 2011 Page 13 of 17 reversion to virulence has not occurred in the vaccine and no safety concerns have been reported in over 10 589 years of use (primarily in the United States and Germ any). Finally, there are no additives or adjuvants in 590 this vaccine, reducing the potential risk associated with these ingredients. 591 592 The porcine circovirus vaccines are used to prevent porcine circovirus type 1 (PCV1) and/or type 2 are assoc iated with post -weaning multisystemic wasting syndrome in swine. The killed 594 Baculovirus vector vaccine and the chimeric vaccine were evaluated separately by the CFIA (2007 and 595 2008a). Authors reported no concerns with the chimeric vaccine in either anima ls or humans; studies in 596 pigs and guinea pigs have showed no adverse reactions and there have been no reports of human disease 597 from porcine circovirus. Both forms of the vaccines contain inactivated, or \"killed\" virus, further reducing 598 their transmission risk. The CFIA reported that the porcince circovirus vaccine, type 2, killed Baculovirus 599 had \"acceptable\" levels of adverse effects in pigs and as with the chimeric viruses. The Baculovirus vector 600 (a virus of insects) can infect mammalian cells, but it c annot replicate. This virus is not associated with 601 disease in humans or animals. 602 603 The bursal disease -Marek's disease live vector vaccine is used to prevent infectious bursal disease in 604 chickens (i.e., Gumboro disease), which can result in lack of coordination, watery diarrhea, and death in 605 infected chickens; and Marek's disease (discussed previously). According to the CFIA report (2008b), the 606 theoretical risk of recombination of the Marek's disease viral DNA and host DNA or other related viruses 607 is low. Furthermore, any genetic changes would likely not be harmful and any effects from irregular gene 608 expression would be minimized by the short life span of chickens. Risk of horizontal gene transfer is not 609 higher or more severe than the risk from wil d type (i.e., non -genetically modified) viruses. As discussed in 610 the context of fowl laryngotacheitis Marek's disease vaccine, individuals working with chickens are at risk 611 of being exposed to the recombinant viruses. However, exposure is not a significa nt health risk because 612 Marek's disease does not readily infect mammals, and the Marek's disease viruses do not reproduce in 613 vaccinated animals. 614 615 The live culture Escherichia coli (E. coli) vaccine consists of a live E. coli bacterial strain that has been 616 inactivated by partial deletion of a gene required for growth. It is used to prevent disease caused by E. coli 617 in poultry and other avian species. The CFIA (2008c) reported that the deletion of such a large part of the 618 gene renders reversion back to patho genicity unlikely. The vaccine cannot survive and persist in the target 619 animal well; thus, the potential for the virus' genes to combine with the host's genes (termed \"genetic 620 recombination\") is low. While there is a theoretical risk of horizontal gene t ransfer, the CFIA stated that 621 any pathogenic bacteria created from gene transfer would not be more pathogenic than wild type strains 622 and would be unable to persist in the environment. Waiting 21 days after inoculation for tissue residues of 623 the vaccine to decrease (the \"withdrawal period\") before slaughtering animals reduces the likelihood of 624 humans being exposed to the vaccine through meat from inoculated animals. 625 626 Additional Question #6 . Can animals, or their offspring, be tested to determine GMO vaccin e use? 627 628 One benefit of some GMO vaccines is the ability to track vaccinated animals. Traditional vaccines induce 629 immune reactions that cannot be separated from immune reactions caused by natural exposure. However, 630 marker vaccines (a type of subunit vacc ine), which are made by deleti ng the genes of one or more 631 microbial/viral proteins, allow the identification of vaccinated animals versus infected animals using a 632 diagnostic test for a protein that is not present in the vaccine. Antibodies can be detected in both 633 vaccinated and unvaccinated animals within a few weeks, including in milk from vaccinated animals 634 (Radostits et al., 2000). 635 636 Additional Question #7 . Benefits of GMO vaccines vs. non -GMO vaccines in the broadest sense, not 637 just cost of production or time required from research to market. 638 639 GMO vaccines have potential advantages over conventional vaccines. For example, GMO vaccines are 640 much more stable than conventional live vaccines during storage and handling. Modified live vaccines 641 (MLVs; a common form of conventional vaccine ) must be stored and handled properly or they risk loss of 642 Technical Evaluation Report Vaccines Made with Genetically M odified Organisms Livestock November 29, 2011 Page 14 of 17 potency (Radostits et al., 2000). The stability of vaccines is particularly important in areas where 643 refrigeration is difficult (Roth and Henderson , 2001). 644 645 The virus in MLVs may become latent, resulting in generalized infection in immunized animals. This has 646 been documented with conventional BHV -1 vaccine (Radostits et al., 2000). As discussed in Question 5, 647 GMO vaccines may also become pathogenic if they mut ate or recombine with other genes. However, as 648 noted, the relative risk of recombination to virulence or ability to become virulent when administered to 649 animals with suppressed immune systems is considered low for many GMO vaccines (Frey, 2007; Roth et 650 and Henderson, 2001). In the case of BHV -1 vaccine, studies showed that the GMO BHV01 vaccine was 651 both effective (with a hundred -fold reduction in viral replication and a shorter period of virus shedding), 652 with reduced virulence and higher safety (Shams, 20 05). This demonstrates that in some cases, GMO 653 vaccines are safer than their traditional counterparts. 654 655 GMO vaccines have an advantage over conventional vaccines because they are assessed for risk in vitro 656 prior to clinical trials, based on the known, del iberate genetic modifications. Conventional vaccines are 657 produced using random mutagenesis of unknown target genes; without knowledge of the genetic 658 background, safety testing is difficult. Most conventional vaccines were evaluated for safety through 659 observations of adverse reactions and stability in clinical trials in experimental animals, without prior 660 testing. There have been a number of conventional vaccines removed from the market after reverting to 661 virulence or causing unintended effects. Furtherm ore, since conventional vaccines are not designed to be 662 traced in the environment, environmental monitoring has historically not been done for these vaccines. 663 GMO vaccines can be clearly distinguished from virulent pathogens and tracked (Frey, 2007). 664 665 It is also important to note that increased vaccination programs have resulted in lowered consumption of 666 veterinary drugs. Livestock produced in accordance with o rganic standards can be given veterinary drugs 667 if they ar e ill; however, any animal treated wit h antibiotics cannot be sold as organic. Because certain 668 GMO vaccines are more efficacious than their conventional counterparts (e.g., DNA vaccines that induce 669 cell-mediated immunity; conventional vaccines only induce humoral immunity ) replacing them with the 670 GMO vaccine would be expected to reduce d isease in livestock, thereby reducing the need to use 671 unapproved drugs on sick animals. 672 673 Additional Question #8 . Does scale, or amount of use, impact type of vaccine developed (i.e., does the 674 organic market warrant development of non -GMO vaccines)? 675 676 Economics appear to be the main driving force behind vaccine development. The goal of veterinary 677 vaccines is to improve overall production for the primary producers, with cost-benefit analysi s being the 678 major consideration. Currently, vaccines represent about 23% of the global market of animal health 679 products, with growth mainly due to biotechnological advances facilitating GMO vaccines (Meeusen et al., 680 2007) . Based on the restrictions on antibiotic use in some farmers in the US and the European Union, the 681 demand for efficacious vaccines will likely grow. According to Meeusen et al. (2007), the factor that 682 determines the success of a new vaccine is successful commercialization and use in the field. 683 684 According to a USDA survey, l ivestock represented 10% of total sales of organic products (USDA, 2008). 685 However, organic food sales made up only about 3% of total U.S. food sales in 2006 (AMRC, 2011). 686 Livestock shares a relatively small percentage of the entire market for meat (organic and conventionally 687 raised) . For example, t he market share of organic beef was 1.6% of the total market for meat (in terms of 688 volume) , based on a 2007 survey (AMRC, 2011) . Organic poultry and eggs are more popular among 689 consumers than organic beef products , although it is unclear what the market share is for organic poultry 690 among all poultry sales (AMRC , 2011 ). 691 692 693 Technical Evaluation Report Vaccines Made with Genetically M odified Organisms Livestock November 29, 2011 Page 15 of 17 References 694 AMRC (Agricultural Marketing Resource Center). 2011. 695 http://www.agmrc.org/commodities__products/livestock/ . 696 697 CAST (Council for Agricultural Science and Technology). 2008.
