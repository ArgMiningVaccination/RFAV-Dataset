That's what awaits you if you do not drink enough water every day. That's the message American Qigong Grand Master Dame Dr. Effie Chow, Ph.D., wanted to get across as she recently returned to talk with Water Life Science\u00ae creator Sharon Kleyne on Kleyne's nationally syndicated weekly radio program, The Sharon Kleyne Hour Water Life Science\u00ae/Nature's Pharma\u00ae, The Power of Water\u00ae & Your Health sponsored by Nature's Tears\u00ae EyeMist\u00ae on VoiceAmerica produced by Rose Hong, founder/director of Global Dragon TV in Washington, D.C. In her opening remarks, Water Life Science\u00ae host Kleyne taught her listeners that \"water is vital. Water is life. Water is who you are. Water Life Science\u00ae is the subject of this radio show every week.\" You are nothing without water! You cannot live without the Power of Water\u00ae, the natural mystery of water, the water of water! As she drove home this critical truth, Water Life Science\u00ae advocate Kleyne announced that she was going to begin to involve insurance companies in the ongoing research and discussion, encouraging them to become involved in Water Life Science\u00ae, water education and alternative medicine. \"If the insurance companies become more involved,\" said Water Life Science\u00ae practitioner Kleyne, \"they will save a lot of money, people will be healthier and live happier lives, and the world's water crisis will be addressed in a positive way.\" \"Water is so important,\" Chow agreed. An energy healer, acupuncturist, humanitarian, international speaker, Futurist and Visionary, Chow has spent more than 40 years integrating traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and Qigong with western medicine. Through the Chow Healing System, Chow works with students and patients to improve posture, breath, diet, sleep and emotions. Chow proudly points to the fact that alternative medicine has now been integrated in all medical schools in the U.S. and Canada. 'Still,\" Chow added, \"there is far to go in Power of Water\u00ae education.\" Chow and Kleyne discussed big step in the right direction, Chow's Global Healing Alliance, through which Chow is also trying to find more affordable health insurance for people who could benefit from alternative medicine. \"Too much alternative therapy is not covered by insurance,\" said Chow. \"People become trapped on a healthcare see-saw. A patient comes to alternative medicine but can only afford a few treatments. They start to feel better, but then must go back to western medicine. Soon, they feel sick again and come back for a little more alternative medicine. This goes on and on.\" Chow described how she has dynamically helped many patients discover improved health by increasing the amount of water they drink on a daily basis. She dramatically told the story of treating one woman and preventing a heart attack because she convinced the woman to drink at least 8 glasses of water a day. A similar regimen saved and improved the life of an older man who had suffered a debilitating stroke. Water Life Science\u00ae researcher Kleyne added that people who care about their health and quality of life should drink 8 to 10 glasses of water every day. She added that people should drink the water one glass entirely at a time rather than sipping. \"Sipping does not deliver maximum absorption!\" Kleyne warned. For eager listeners willing to learn and live longer, healthier lives, Chow described alternative medicine in this way. \"Qigong is the umbrella, the grandmother. Underneath Qigong one finds the martial arts, such as Tai Chi and other practices. There is also the system of traditional Chinese medicine, meditation, posture and breath exercises.\" Chow also recommends touch and three good belly laughs a day for happier minds and healthy bodies. * If you would like to listen to the program featuring international healer Dame Dr. Effie Chow, Ph.D. and Water Life Science\u00ae educator Sharon Kleyne talking about the global water crisis, the importance of drinking enough pure water for health, Qigong and healing, please follow this link: https://www.voiceamerica.com/episode/112360/global-healing-requires-global-healing-alliance Date aired: January 7th, 2019 Guest: Dame Dr. "}
