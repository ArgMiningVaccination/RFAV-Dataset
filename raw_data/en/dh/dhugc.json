Next time you're experiencing a toothache, back pain, or any other pain, you can try an herbal and natural pain reliever like turmeric. If you have a toothache, backache, or any other type of pain, your first impulse may be to reach for a pain medication. Many people rely on medications, but they can come with a risk of side effects, drug interactions, and sometimes misuse. While certain circumstances may require a prescription or over-the-counter (OTC) pain medication, it may also be possible to find some of the relief you need from a variety of natural pain relievers. Many [herbs](/nutrition/anti-inflammatory-herbs) and spices have a long history of being used to relieve inflammation and pain. These natural pain relievers fall under a category of treatment known as alternative medicine, which also includes [acupuncture](/health/dry-needling-vs-acupuncture), [yoga](/health/fitness-exercise/top-yoga-iphone-android-apps), [reiki](/health/reiki), and other practices. There can be a lot of benefits to easing pain and inflammation more naturally, but keep in mind that these natural remedies can occasionally interfere with other medications you are taking. Furthermore, some natural pain relievers have not been well studied in humans (especially when it comes to dosage), and many [supplements](/nutrition/how-to-choose-high-quality-vitamins-and-supplements) are not tested by an independent lab to ensure quality or safety. Supplements are also not regulated for quality by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) like drugs are. If you're dealing with pain or chronic issues, it's best to talk with a doctor before buying any natural remedies. [Integrative medicine professionals](https://integrativemedicine.arizona.edu/alumni.html), which are physicians who have training in more natural remedies, may be a great option if you're seeking alternative forms of pain therapy. It's also important to consult a qualified health professional before adding any supplements to your routine, especially if you have any underlying health conditions or are taking other medications. Boswellia, otherwise known as frankincense, is often used in [Ayurvedic medicine](/health/ayurveda-and-aruna-bhargavas-story). The resin from Boswellia serrata trees is what is typically turned into tinctures, pills, or topical treatments. What is it used to treat? Boswellia is often used [to treat](https://www.mskcc.org/cancer-care/integrative-medicine/herbs/boswellia): - asthma symptoms - arthritis [colitis](/health/colitis)(inflamed colon) - general inflammation - reduction of fluid cerebral edema ( [brain swelling](/health/cerebral-edema)) - reduction of radiotherapy A [2020 study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7368679/) [osteoarthritis (OA)](/health/osteoarthritis), easing pain and stiffness. Possible side effects While Boswellia is generally safe, topical application can cause an allergic reaction in some people. It may also negatively interact with certain medications, including [anticoagulant and antiplatelet drugs](/health/anticoagulant-and-antiplatelet-drugs). If you're taking one of these drugs, Boswellia extract may increase the possibility of bleeding. [Turmeric](/nutrition/top-10-evidence-based-health-benefits-of-turmeric) is the spice that gives curry its signature yellow hue and unique flavor. It contains the compound curcumin, an antioxidant that helps [protect](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC5664031/) Though most commonly used as a spice, turmeric is also available in supplement form and is often paired with piperine, a compound found in black pepper, to increase its absorption. What is it used to treat? Turmeric may be useful for the treatment of many conditions, [including](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31255636/) [indigestion](/health/indigestion) [ulcers](/health/stomach-ulcer) - stomach upset [psoriasis](/health/psoriasis) - inflammation caused by conditions like OA Possible side effects Though turmeric is generally considered safe, several side effects have been reported. Some of the most common side effects [include](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC5664031/) - nausea [diarrhea](/health/diarrhea) - headaches [rashes](/health/rashes) [yellow stool](/health/digestive-health/yellow-stool) Be sure to talk with a doctor before using turmeric supplements. Stop using them if you experience any negative side effects. Whole [cloves](/nutrition/benefits-of-cloves) are often used to spice up meat and rice dishes. Ground cloves are used in pies and many other foods. Cloves are also [widely used](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7072209/) Cloves can be found in capsule or powder form. [Clove oil](/health/clove-essential-oil) is also available and can be applied topically to reduce pain. What is it used to treat? Clove is often used to [treat](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7072209/) [nausea](/health/nausea) [colds](/health/cold-flu/home-remedies) - [arthritic inflammation](/health/inflammatory-arthritis) [toothaches](/health/toothaches) - indigestion - diarrhea Some [research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6766912/) Possible side effects When used as a supplement, cloves may be [associated](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/318683607_Pharmacological_and_Toxicological_Properties_of_Eugenol) with side effects such as: [liver problems](/health/liver-diseases) - allergic reactions - skin irritation - increased bleeding Though clove oil can be applied topically to treat issues such as [toothache pain](/health/clove-oil-toothache), undiluted clove oil may actually [hurt](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC7072209/) People with [bleeding disorders](/health/bleeding-disorders) or those who are taking [blood-thinning medication](/health/heart-disease/blood-thinners) should also be careful when consuming clove products, as clove and clove oil can increase the risk of bleeding. For this reason, it's important to consult a doctor before using herbal supplements that contain clove. This ancient Chinese medical practice seeks to [relieve](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30335320/) For this practice, acupuncturists insert tiny, thin needles into your skin. The location of the insertion is related to the source of the pain. Based on the qi, a needle may be inserted far from the part of the body experiencing pain. Acupuncture may relieve pain by [causing](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29250675/) [serotonin](/health/mental-health/serotonin), a \"feel-good\" brain chemical that eases pain. It is also believed to reduce stress levels and promote healing in the body. What is it used to treat? Acupuncture may help provide relief from several types of pain, [including](https://www.aafp.org/afp/2019/0715/p89.html): - knee OA [migraine](/health/migraine) [myofascial pain](/health/myofascial-pain) - acute and chronic low back pain [fibromyalgia](/health/fibromyalgia) [neck pain](/health/neck-pain) Possible side effects Acupuncture may be [linked](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK532287/) Some of the most common side effects [include](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC4538973/) - organ, tissue, or nerve injury [infections](/health/signs-of-infection) - allergic reactions - increased bleeding [loss of consciousness](/health/consciousness-decreased) To make sure it's safe for you, talk with a doctor before trying acupuncture if you: - have a pacemaker - are pregnant - have bleeding disorders - use blood thinners, such as warfarin Among the most common home pain remedies is [applying heat and ice](/health/chronic-pain/treating-pain-with-heat-and-cold) directly to sites of pain. While this treatment may seem obvious, not everyone is clear on exactly when to use ice versus heat. Applying an ice pack to reduce [swelling](/health/swelling) and inflammation shortly after you experience a strained muscle, tendon, or ligament may bring relief. Interestingly, once the inflammation has decreased, heat may help reduce the [stiffness](/health/muscle-stiffness) that comes with [sprains and strains](/health/sprain-vs-strain). A heating pad or cold pack used briefly on the head may also help reduce the pain of a headache, while an ice pack can help relieve low back pain. If your painful problem is arthritis, moist heat applied to the affected joint will help more than ice. Moist heat packs can be warmed in the microwave and used many times, making them effective and easy to use. What is it used to treat? Applying an ice pack may help treat issues like: - swelling - bleeding [inflammation](/health/inflammation) - headaches - low back pain [strained](/health/strains)muscles, tendons, or ligaments Meanwhile, applying heat can provide relief from conditions such as: Possible side effects Applying heat or ice to an injury for too long could increase the risk of burns and other side effects. Some of the most common side effects of heat or cold therapy include: If you get injured or experience chronic pain, talk with a doctor or pharmacist about how to best use heat or ice to help ease the pain. The natural pain relievers described above may only be effective for specific causes of pain and may not work for everyone. However, these natural options may at least give you a few options to try, either alone or paired with prescription or OTC medications. Remember, pain is the body's signal that something is wrong. It may be temporary, as with a strained muscle, but it may also signify a serious health problem that requires medical treatment. Don't hesitate to seek out a healthcare professional to diagnose the source of your pain and discuss the best options for treating it. Additionally, always talk with a doctor or pharmacist before using any supplements or herbal products, especially if you have any health conditions or are taking other medications. "}
