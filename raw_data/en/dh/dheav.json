Integrating Ancient Wisdom with High-Tech Medicine Recent surveys show that more than half of all Americans use some form of complementary or alternative therapy to enhance their healing or maintain their health. Research has shown that relaxation techniques such as Massage Therapy, Therapeutic Touch, Reflexology and Reiki help to decrease anxiety, strengthen the immune system, diminish pain and accelerate healing. While we often focus on the physical aspects of healing, we are learning that healing incorporates the mind, body and spirit. When mind-body techniques are used, benefits are often experienced on all three levels and there is often a greater sense of participating in the healing process.

Benefits of our services are a general sense of well-being, better sleep quality, increased range of motion, improved digestion, pain relief and relaxation.
