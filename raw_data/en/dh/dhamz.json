Service providers will follow existing guidance for positive case management. - While MCCSS congregate living settings have been identified by the Ministry of Health as a priority for PCR testing, where such testing is not available, any positive results from a rapid antigen test will no longer require a confirmed laboratory-based PCR or molecular point of care test (e.g. ID NOW). - Regularly screen all visitors entering a congregate living setting, regardless of the visitor's vaccination status. - A visitor with a positive result on a rapid antigen test must not be permitted entry and should be encouraged to follow public health direction for persons presumed positive for COVID-19. - Make rapid antigen screening available for residents who return to a congregate living setting from an overnight absence, regardless of vaccination status. - For clarity, it is not mandatory that returning residents undertake the test. However, service providers are strongly encouraged to promote the use of rapid antigen screening by returning residents as a measure to help protect others in the congregate living setting. - Testing new admissions and transfers, regardless of vaccination status, where PCR testing is not available in a timely manner. - Rapid antigen screening is to be used on the day of admission/transfer, as part of active screening upon entry, and day four following admission/transfer. - Testing residents who are symptomatic where PCR testing is not available in a timely manner.
