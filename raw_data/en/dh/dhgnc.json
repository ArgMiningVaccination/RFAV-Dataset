In addition to a meditation practice since his early teens, and over 30 years of training under a world-renowned spiritual teacher, he spent three years in India studying and performing volunteer medical work, culminating in an inner transformation that radically changed his approach to life and healing. Now in addition to practicing as a chiropractic physician, he offers healing work which goes beyond the boundaries of most other mainstream and alternative therapies, wedding Eastern and Western medicine --along with his spiritual insight -- into a powerful synthesis to offer new hope in healing the physical and emotional pain of others. Dr. Michael Ackerman has been in private practice for over 36 years. His background includes a bachelor's degree from Whitman College in the field of psychology. His professional education was completed at the National University of Health Sciences in Chicago, where he graduated with honors as class valedictorian, receiving two degrees: Bachelor of Science in Human Biology and Doctor of Chiropractic Medicine. Healing sessions are offered in-office, via Skype video call, or phone, serving clients living in the United States, Europe, the Middle East, South America, and Australia. \"I would estimate that approximately 98 out of 100 clients who come for healing truly reach the very lofty goals we set for their sessions, including leaving in a state of feeling total joy. It's rare that other kinds of healing methods or therapies can achieve this.\" - Dr. Michael Ackerman, D.C. \"Michael has an unusual gift. Even over the phone he is able to lucidly assess many internal problems -- both physical and emotional - and also heal them. I consider Michael an invaluable ally on my spiritual and healing journey.\"* \u2014 David Sawyer, \"Converge For Impact\"; Portland, OR \"Michael Ackerman is the most extraordinary healer I've ever known. His rare psychic ability and potent spiritual awareness, combined with his professional chiropractic and medical knowledge, give him access to cutting edge healing powers, allowing mental, emotional, physical and spiritual healing to occur in even a single session. His deep connection with Amma (Mata Amritanandamayi), known in the West as \"the Hugging Saint\", makes him a conduit for the highest kind of grace. Not only that...he's a sweetheart of a guy. Highly recommended!\"* \u2014 Ram Das Batchelder, Author of \"Rising in Love\" \"I feel that the work with Dr Michael felt exactly like a relationship that facilitates more openness and receptivity! I felt the trust was there from the very start which allowed me to feel safe enough to share those dark corners of myself I tried to keep hidden for so long. The work I've done with Dr Michael has been some of the hardest in my life yet I feel lighter and clearer than ever in the almost 66 years I've had in this lifetime. Eternally grateful for the surprising path this work put me on. Wouldn't want to be anywhere else.\"* \u2014 Lisa Jacoby, Fairfield, CT \"Despite 20 years in psychotherapy and little change with persisting thoughts of suicide, my therapist referred me to try healing work with Dr. Ackerman. Within just a few weeks, I felt the first taste of freedom from these thoughts in as long as I can remember. Soon, my therapist also began doing phone sessions with him.\"* \u2014 Joan K.; Brooklyn, NY \"I've had panic attacks and depression for more than 15 years. I tried CBT & DBT therapy, different meds, and also psychiatrists and psychologists. None of that ever worked, in fact most made me way worse. I worked with Dr. Michael Ackerman for only a few short months but after a few sessions I learned to relieve my stress and anxiety in such an easy way that I have not had a single panic attack since I worked with Dr. Michael. I have also stopped taking all meds, and all other forms of therapy. Thank you Dr. Michael!\"* \u2014 Fernando A., H.R. Specialist; San Diego, CA \"I walked into Dr. Ackerman's office with a broken heart from a cheating spouse, which literally felt like living with the pain of a constant heart attack. With just one session, Dr. Ackerman released all of the negative feelings, showing me the \"light\" within, and teaching me the connection between the power of inner healing and my spine and body. He is the 'real deal', a 'dream package': integrity, knowledge, heart and soul, passion, compassion, and extraordinary techniques! I owe him more than words can express.\"* \u2014 Dr. Irene Lee, Ph.D.; La Jolla, CA \"Dr. Ackerman is a medical gem hidden in a nondescript building on Torrey Pines Road. His healing modalities are unlike anything I've experienced or heard of with other medical practitioners. He has developed an uncanny sense of intuition about the connections between thoughts, emotions and health that gives him a great advantage in solving issues rather than just managing symptoms. I'm fairly rational and \"left brained\". Seeing what Dr. A can tap into and how accurate his non-traditional healing techniques are has given me solid evidence that there is a much bigger picture related to total health than traditional Western medicine accepts.\"* \u2014 Justin Beattie, Commercial Realtor; Carlsbad, CA \"For me, Dr. Ackerman has bridged the gap between the scientific and intuition. And, in my opinion, Dr. Ackerman achieves this synergy on a daily basis... Perhaps the most impressive part of Dr. Ackerman's treatments is his ability to assess his patient's problems intuitively and then make corrections scientifically. He is able to sense the limits within his patient's consciousness and free them from the psychological patterns that are hampering their bodies. I highly recommend Dr. Ackerman.\"* \u2014 Brett Dickinson, Tennis Pro; La Jolla, CA \"Thank you also for an amazing session. I feel it went deep and it was subtle and when any hidden/shadow thoughts or beliefs were brought to light, I didn't feel judged, but felt benevolence. That is amazing. Thank you for your gift of intuition and how you use it to get to the root of where I'm stuck. I couldn't get to such depths at all or even know such healing existed on such a deep level if I hadn't experienced what I have so far. I feel something has/is already shifted inside. I'm thankful that I found you and that I have this opportunity to work in this way . I'm thankful I have some resources available to give this to gift myself in this way. So grateful. Many Blessing for what you do.\" \u2014Valerie Horsley, Sherwood, U.K. \"In addition to decreasing the frequency and intensity of my migraine headaches, on one notable occasion he took away painful back spasms that had been bothering me for several days, while talking to me on my cell phone during my son's soccer game.\"* \u2014 Dr. M. L., Internal Medicine, La Jolla \"To put into words what an incredibly positive impact Dr. Ackerman has made upon my life seems all too limiting. He is an incredible human being who embodies spirituality, wisdom, and compassion; each element spilling over into his work as a chiropractor. He is always patient and kind, shedding light on areas of my life which at times seem overwhelming. I always feel listened to. I always leave feeling like my eyes are more opened than when I entered, ready to live life more fully and with greater clarity. He spends a significant amount of time EVERY time. I was recommened to Dr. Ackerman by two friends who have received the same benefits and sing his praises as loudly and fully as I. If you are looking for help in physical, emotional, and/or spiritual areas please do yourself a favor and call Dr. Ackerman.\"* \u2014 Christopher Wilhelm, M.S.W.; San Diego,CA \"Dr. Ackerman is absolutely a fantastic healer who focuses on helping you to feel better and more clear than you have ever felt before. In addition to his quite remarkable chiropractic abilities, Dr Ackerman is incredibly intuitive enabling True Healing to occur. I, along with numerous family members and friends, have been helped by Dr. Ackerman for years and although we have seen many Doctors and Healers, none compare to Dr Ackerman. I highly recommend Dr. Ackerman -- he literally can help to change your life in the most positive of ways.\"* \u2014 Mike Mollenhauer, Author, Healer; San Diego, CA Past C.F.O. of The Brigantine Corporation \"My girlfriend and I are still together thanks to all of my work with Michael, who helped us to clear away many of the issues and challenges which periodically arose in our relationship.\"* \u2014 P. H., Architect, La Jolla, CA \"I rarely drink to excess, but this one morning I came into Dr. Ackerman's office after my girlfriend's birthday party with a smashing hang-over and headache that I rated as an '8' in intensity on a '0-10' scale. I didn't believe he could do it, but he got my headache down to \"0\" using only his energy healing work!\"* \u2014 Lauren K., Restaurant Manager, San Diego, CA \"Over the past 4 years, I have found the weekly sessions with Dr. Ackerman to be truly transformational with my own personal issues and of great service in enhancing my own professional work with psychotherapy clients.\"* \u2014 Dr. Mary M., Ph.D., Psychologist; Stockton, CA \"Hi Michael, I just wanted to write you and let you know that I'm forever grateful for the couple of healing sessions that I recently had with you! My life has made so many changes in a positive direction, and I have been able to see things differently and approach different challenges in ways I have not done until now. I would refer any one that is willing to come and make serious changes to there life. Thank you so Much!!!\"* \u2014 Jeff Denison, Escondido, CA \"One day I was having severe menstrual cramps and I just happened to mention that years ago I used to feel relief by having my puppy lie on top of my stomach. Using emotional healing techniques, in just a few minutes, Dr. Ackerman magically took all my pain away without even touching me... I had to admit he did even better than my puppy!\"* \u2014 Angela Scrivano, Real Estate Marketing, San Diego, CA \"I would like to express my deep gratitude and thankful that you have given great blessings and added great tools in my life Path or Work Path. I would not have been able to walk through alone in the quantum Jungle without your blessings and grace. Lately I have been able to perform the Clearing Processes you gave me for Total Peace, Total Joy, Tranquility & Meditative Mind, and Relationship Clearing which removes lots of karma ...as well as running the Orb's of EJ Gold. I am truly grateful as my life has more than just transformed. I truly owe a great deal of Appreciation and am thankful for the Grace given by Rohit that he approached me to work with Dr. Ackerman.\" \u2014 Jayesh Patel, Software Engineer, Texas * [CLICK HERE FOR OUR GOOGLE REVIEWS](https://www.google.com/search?aqs=chrome.0.69i59l2j0l2j46l4.3208j1j7&ie=UTF-8&oq=san%20diego%20chiropra&q=san%20diego%20chiropractic%20and%20healing%20center&sourceid=chrome) * *Legal Disclaimer: Although these testimonials are representative of the experiences of many healing clients, your individual results may vary.
