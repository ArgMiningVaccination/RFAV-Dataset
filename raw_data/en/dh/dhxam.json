'Prana' is a Sanskrit word, which means life-force that is an invisible form of vital energy. This life force influences a person's natural healing force and tries to bring a harmony. History Master Chao Kok Sui, who worked and projected principles of yoga, Pranic healing and similar spiritual practices for the betterment of the society. He is also an author and speaker and has worked on many projects of Pranic healing. Principle Pranic healing is an energy medicine, mainly based on the principle of healing without touch. It believes in a person's ability to heal oneself and hence works on the energy plane to bring about the healing process. It aims at providing energy to the body to repair itself and bring back harmony into life. By stimulating the life force of an affected body part, it can help in speeding up the healing process. Ailments are believed to affect the energy planes before they are actually seen as physical health problems. Pranic healing tries to tap these disturbances and imbalances at the energy level or on the electromagnetic field called aura of a person. It aims at setting the imbalances right at the same level and allow the person's natural life force to get into action for healing. For this purpose pranic healing involves absorbing the energy and circulating it in the whole body. The concept includes the presence of inner aura, health aura and outer aura, which are instrumental in this healing process. Method Pranic healing is practiced in the form of energy medicine and works on the energy that surrounds a person. It harmonizes and balances the energy flow process and helps in healing. This is generally performed in the form of meditation. This can also include maintaining specific postures or chanting specific words that help in healing the disrupted aura. A person who needs to practice this therapy and wishes to get healed with it should be willing to do so, as it works on the energy level. A trained practitioner is able to guide about the method and the duration can be decided. Pranic healing does not use the method of touch or medicines and focuses only on the aura to restore health. Benefits Pranic healing is useful in a variety of physical and emotional problems. "}
