I am continuing to take all necessary precautions (as listed below), to protect against the possible transmission of COVID -19. This is in line with the Australian Government's Federal and State public health guidelines in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. **If you do have cold and flu symptoms or have come into contact with a confirmed COVID-19 case - you will need to be tested. It is vital that you self isolate and for the rest of us - stay safe, stay healthy, wash your hands, social distance, wear a mask and get vaccinated.** For more information follow this [link](https://www.nsw.gov.au/covid-19) or call Health direct on 1800 022 222 What does this mean for Kirsten Hill Naturopathy?

COVID Safe Practices As a health care worker I have been fully vaccinated (including booster on 5/01/22), against COVID-19. To provide a safe environment I need you to be fully vaccinated (including booster once due), for Remedial Massage and face to face Naturopathy Consults. You will need to reschedule your appointment if you have returned from overseas in the last 14 days, are suffering from cold or flu symptoms, have a temperature greater than 37.5 degrees Celsius, are in isolation or have been in contact with someone who has tested COVID-19 positive. . Hand washing facilities and/or hand sanitiser will be available for anyone attending the clinic. Face masks need to be worn by the practitioner and the client during the consult. This is to provide a safe environment as it is difficult to adequately social distance. Adequate social distancing will be implemented in the clinic by spacing out chairs in the waiting room and in the clinic, only seeing one person at a time and staggering appointment times. The massage table and consultation area will be cleaned with disinfectant after each client. Linen will continue to be replaced after each client. Surfaces and equipment in and near the clinic will be cleaned with disinfectant between clients and on a regular basis. This is the time you need your health to be at its very best and remain productive in both work and play. "}
