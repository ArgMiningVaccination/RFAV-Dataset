These challenges involve developing vaccines to create protective T-cell response, cellular immune monitoring for protective response early in patients, and cellular prediction and cytokine level monitoring for toxicities related to cytokine storms. Download this eBook to learn how IsoPlexis helps you overcome these challenges by functionally defining each cell type involved in the immune response. "}
