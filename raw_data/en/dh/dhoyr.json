Many are seeking to bolster traditional Western medicine with more holistic approaches to healing, which focus not only on the physical body, but the emotional and spiritual spectrums as well. The focus of yoga is to energize and balance all of the seven major chakra systems. A chakra is simply an energy center within the body, ruling over certain aspects of the culmination of our existence. The chakra system is derived from an Indian belief system, and is implemented throughout many religions, including Hinduism and Tantric Buddhism. Many who are Christian or Jewish also practice chakra healing and meditation. The act of aligning your chakra centers does not have to be religious, as it does spiritual. If you choose to align your meditation with the divinity of your choosing, that's entirely up to you. The ultimate end of chakra alignment is to fulfill you emotionally and spiritually, while energizing you physically as a direct result of the alignment of your higher energy centers. (Also known as your personal vibration caused by natural electromagnetism.)

Of course, the healing art lends itself well either way- making it ideal for people subscribing to either school of thought. The Physical Benefits Of Meditation Those who rely on meditation regulate their blood pressure, stimulate the nervous system, achieve better sleep, improve their ability to focus, experience less stress, and boost the immune system. Crystal Chakra Healing 101 According to Chopra there are seven major energy centers corresponding to \"massive nerve centers in the body.\" Each of these energy spheres, or chakras influence nerves in ruling over each of our critical organs. When blockages in energy occur, we experience sickness, disease, or emotional unrest. Chakra healing balances any under or overactive centers for physical, spiritual, and emotional health! The names of all seven are the Root Chakra, Sacral, Solar Plexus, Heart, Throat, Third Eye, and Crown. In this post we'll cover the first three, Root, Sacral, and Solar Plexus, as building a firm foundation in chakra healing is essential before moving onto the more spiritual energy centers. Below you'll find a rundown of the first three chakras, and how imbalances may contribute to addiction. You'll find actionable solutions to restore imbalances you can do at home to promote recovery and help you stay on the path to emotional wellness and sobriety! The Root Chakra In Sanskrit the Root Chakra is called Muladhara. The color most associated with this energy center is red. The root chakra center is located at the base of the spine and governs our primal forces. When properly aligned one feels whole, at peace with one's sense of self, and is overall secure in themselves and the environments surrounding them. The physical organs associated with the root chakra include the first three vertebrae, the bladder, and the colon, according to Chopra. In terms of addiction, an imbalance in the root chakra may cause a propensity to cling to money, food, and stagnation. Those with an overactive root chakra may experience laziness, excessive [weight gain](https://zinniahealth.com/substance-use/alcohol/weight-gain), overeating, an unhealthy love for things material, avarice, anxiety over change, and addiction to security \u2014 meaning, one may hold onto people or circumstances which are more harmful than helpful, in a desperate attempt to hold onto \"security.\" Underactive root chakras manifest in fearfulness, chronic anxiety, restlessness, a tendency to under-eat, disorganization, and may lead to financial instability, according to Reiki. Many who have had to fight for survival may struggle with an unbalanced root chakra. Healing your base energy center is absolutely imperative to create a solid foundation for your mental, physical, and spiritual growth. Remedying the root chakra will require you to dig deep and finally accept that, \"Yes!\" you do belong here, you have a purpose, and you are important. Affirmation For The Root Chakra Try saying this daily affirmation in times of stress or uncertainty: I am rooted firmly to this sacred ground. In myself I feel whole. I am needed. I have purpose. I will manifest my ambitions everyday. Crystal Healing For The Root Chakra The laying of stones is one of the traditional means of healing unbalanced chakras. For the root chakra, place your crystal or gemstone on the base of your spine and visualize the red petals of this energy center radiating throughout your lower body. See the petals of a the red lotus spin clockwise \u2014 if that doesn't feel right, envision the petals spinning counter clockwise, until eventually the flower comes to rest. At this point visualize bright, white light pouring into the center of the flower to connect the red lotus into the stream of your consciousness. Feel the lotus flow freely through your feet, legs, stomach, chest, arms, hands, all the way up to your head. Know that when your root chakra is aligned and energized, nothing can derail you from your path. Use the following healing crystals: red jasper, carnelian, garnet, smoky quartz, and obsidian. When selecting a crystal to use for healing your root chakra, choose one that feels right. If I haven't listed it here, trust your intuition! Typically the rule of thumb is to use stones associated with grounding, or that are red or \"earthy\" in color. The Sacral Chakra In Sanskrit the name of the Sacral Chakra is Svadhisthana (meaning sweetness). The color ruling this energy center is spritely orange! This chakra rules our sexuality and creative side. Artists, writers, singers, and all people creative experiencing writing block, or lull in their creative spirits may suffer from an unbalanced Sacral Chakra! In terms of addiction treatment, an overactive second chakra will foment overwhelming feelings, perhaps precipitating instances of self medication. Obsessive attachment to people is common with an overactive Sacral Chakra, and may come with the tendency to manipulate others. Emotional dependency is another indication something may not be quite right. An underactive second chakra manifests in social awkwardness, an unhealthy fear of intimacy, the absence of excitement, passion, or the self inflicted denial of pleasure (whether that is physically or emotionally). Healing the Sacral Chakra is essential to enjoy life again! You may feel empty without the use of your substance of choice, but balancing the second chakra can help you reclaim your sense of joy and pleasure in the smaller things in life. If you can't derive joy from the people and things around you, who used to brim you with happiness- look to your sacral chakra as a possible cause. Affirmation Of Sacral Chakra Come planes of joy! I am the essence of spirit and soul. I am the creator of my own happiness. I am beautiful and one with my body. I will accept happiness because I am deserving. I am the spirit. I am life. I am home. Crystal Healing For Sacral Chakra The second chakra exists right above your pubic bone, and is the essence of your creative expression. Being able to freely express yourself will eliminate the chances of relapse, because you will have an active means to expunge the high stress situations which may have otherwise lead you to relapse. [Heroin](https://zinniahealth.com/substance-use/heroin) and alcohol addiction are specifically mentioned in relation to the disharmony of this chakra by Reiki, Balancing the Sacral Chakra will allow you to pursue the things in life that bring you joy, without berating, or second guessing yourself. Place your healing crystal right below your navel and envision a brimming, sunkissed lotus blooming in the same place your stone is resting. Visualize the lotus emanating orange light, and feel it spin clockwise. While breathing deeply, invite its energy to surge through your entire body, bathing your head in its light. Envision yourself actively writing, singing, or doing whatever it is you're passionate about. Soak up this energy as long as you need. When you feel that you are whole and at peace with yourself channel this energy back into the petals of your lotus and feel its presence radiating for the days to come. Crystals to use: citrine, amber, yellow topaz, fire opal, moonstone Again, trust your intuition when selecting which stone to use, and expand beyond this list! You may find the first time using this meditation you prefer one stone to another, but change your mind after a second time. Select stones that are golden or orange in hue. The Solar Plexus Chakra Manipura, or lustrous gem, is the name of the Solar Plexus Chakra in Sanskrit. The third chakra rules our sense of personal power and helps to keep us on the right path, by acting on our aspirations and lifelong dreams. The Solar Plexus Chakra controls our sense of will, and allows us to achieve our goals, and pull from our inner font of vitality. A healthy third chakra allows for a measure of healthy spontaneity! Addiction associated with an unbalanced third chakra include amphetamines, cocaine, and caffeine. Many will also experience unwarranted aggression. An overactive third center results in controlling and dominating behavior, an inflated arrogance, hyperactivity, and behavior that is excessively combative and competitive. An underactive third chakra reveals itself in low [energy, lack of will, low self esteem](https://zinniahealth.com/substance-use/co-occurring-disorders/self-esteem), passivity, physical and emotional coldness, and escapism \u2014 always blaming others. A balanced Solar Plexus will allow you to complete your goals, take responsibility for your actions, and rise to any occasion. You will achieve self acceptance, and acknowledge the power locked away inside of you. Affirmation For The Solar Plexus Chakra I recognize the power within myself. I am the ruler of my own fate. I will let go of all negativity. I will continue to grow. Crystal Healing For The Solar Plexus Chakra The third chakra's color is yellow, and it's place is above the naval. To restore your sense of personal power, and relinquish all enfeeblements preventing you from achieving your full potential, envision a blooming golden lotus bud resting on your abdomen (where you will place your healing crystal). Focus and pour your energy into the lotus to make it bloom. Visualize all of the petals unfurling in immaculate pearls of sunrise rays. As each stream of light reveals itself, feel the beams dance over your body, and empower you with the will to achieve your goals. Allow this radiance to cascade and traipse the entirety of your frame, emanating from your third energy center. As the beams become more accessible, visualize your yellow lotus blossoming entirely. Once you feel at peace visualize your personal sun rays encircling your lotus clockwise, ultimately coming to rest in the center of it.
