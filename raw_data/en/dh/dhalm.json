Also, I just want to say THANK YOU! I wake to your 6phase morning meditation daily, and... after COVID and fibromyalgia, it's helping me to regain my senses! Thank you, [Vishen Lakhiani](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vishen?trk=public_post_comment-text) for sharing this as I feel fully aligned with the view that SLEEP is our \"everything\" and the natural humanbeing's remedy to fight many of the problems. We need to cherish it and not sacrifice for anything, as it is a great gift to be able to fall asleep quickly and to have a good quality, rejuvenating sleep! I am guilty of sactificing it from time to time, but quitting that habit :). I used malatonin, which is quite popular in the US, and which worked quite effectively and mildly for me without ant feeling of sidr effects in the morning. But I used it infrequently not to get used to it. Will check out the \"one\" supplement you recommended as well.

Melatonin is a prescription drug here in Denmark. I wonder why?
