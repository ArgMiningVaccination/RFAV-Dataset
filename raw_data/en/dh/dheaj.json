Among influenza viruses typed since week 40, virtually all have been influenza A , with just under 70% subtyped as A(H1N1)pdm09 overall since season start. More recently, however, A(H3N2) viruses have comprised a greater share of influenza A detections, accounting for just over 70% of subtyped influenza A viruses in week 13. For this second influenza A wave (due to A(H3N2)), the proportion of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza A in week 13 (37%) is comparable to that during the peak of the first wave (due to A(H1N1)pdm09) in week 51 (34%). However, it remains too early to determine whether this second influenza A wave has peaked. Ongoing monitoring is required. In week 13, eight laboratory -confirmed long- term care facility (LTCF) outbreaks of influenza A (7 with subtype still pending and 1 influenza B ) were reported. The number of LTCF outbreaks reported in weeks 8 through 13 represent s more than a 60% increase over the cumulative tally of LTCF outbreaks reported since the beginning of the season (week 40 to week 7), consistent with the incr ease in influenza A( H3N2) in recent weeks. While this late -season A(H3N2) wave is ongoing, clinicians are reminded to maintain a high index of suspicion for influenza. Early empiric treatment with influenza antiviral medication should be considered for high-risk, severely ill , or hospitalized patients with suspected influenza illness, regardless of the patient's influenza vaccination status and without awaiting laboratory confirmation.

Nine (35%) sentinel sites reported data for week 13 and rates are subject to change as reporting becomes more complete (Figure 1 ).

BC INFLUENZA SURVEILLANCE 2018 -19 4 Figure 4 Interior Fraser Vancouver Coastal Vancouver Island Northern BC INFLUENZA SURVEILLANCE 2018 -19 5 British Col umbia Laboratory Reports Methodological explanation With expanded influenza testing by additional laboratories across British Columbia (BC) , adjustments to data analysis methods have been required in order to reliably interpret trends in laboratory findings . Derivation of the percentage of respiratory specimens testing influenza positive has been revised to enable more reliable comparison from week to week. The percentage influenza positivity is now presented, by influenza type, based on primary specimens submitted for influenza testing at the BCCDC Public Health Laboratory (PHL) and other external sites that share complete testing data with the BCCDC PHL. It should be recognized that this report does not include data from all influenza test ing sites across the province. The BCCDC PHL conducts the majority of influenza subtype characterization for the province, including for primary specimens submitted directly to the BCCDC PHL for influenza diagnosis, as well as for specimens that have tested positive for influenza at other external sites and f or which secondary subtyping is requested of the BCCDC PHL. Laboratory surveillance observations To date, of 14,033 known specimens tested for influenza across BC since week 40 (s tarting October 1, 2018) , 3563 (25%) tested positive for influenza A and just 92 (0.7%) tested positive for influenza B. Virtually all (97%) influenza detections have therefore been influenza A so far this season . In week 13, 246/658 (37%) specimens tested positive for i nfluenza A, an increase compared to week 12 (309/951; 32%) and consistent with an unusual late-season wave of influenza A . In week 13 , influenza B positivity remained stable at 2% ( 15/658), maintaining the unusual ly low levels of influenza B observed this season (Figure 5 ). Since week 40, a mong influenza A viru ses subtyped (67%) to week 12 (2728/3 951; 69%) and consistent with increasing A(H3N2) contribution in recent weeks . Since week 40, 3 influenza A/B co- infections have been detected (1 A(H1N1)pdm09, 1 A(H3N2), and 1 subtype pending). Of the 343 influen za viruses typed in week 13, 323 (94%) were influenza A and 20 (6%) w ere influenza B. In week 13 , among the influenza A viruses, 116 (36%) were identified as A(H3N2), 45 (14%) as A(H1N1)pdm09, and for 162 (50%) subtype was still pending. Among subtyped influenza A viruses in week 13, therefore, the majority ( 116/323; 72%) were A(H3N2), a slight increase from week 12 (220/313; 70%) (Figure 6). Note that subtype remains pending for half of influenza A specimens in week 13 ; therefore, these proportions may change as subtyping becomes more complete. Nevertheless, these findings continue the trend of greater A(H3N2) contribution relative to A(H1N1)pdm09 observed in recent weeks. Of note, the proportion of respiratory specimens testing influenza A positive in week 13 (37%) of this second back -to-back influenza A wave (predominantly A(H3N2) subtype) is comparable to that during the peak of the earlier influenza A wave (predominantly A(H1N1)pdm09 subtype) in week 51 (34%). I t remains too early to determine whether this second influenza A wave has peaked. Ongoing monitoring is needed. Since week 40, approximately half (52 %) of A(H1N1)pdm09 detections were among adults 20- 64 year s of age (Figure 8 ). Twenty -one percent of A(H1N1)pdm09 detections were observed among children 9 years who comprise about 10% of the BC population1. Children aged 10-19 years comprised a smaller proportion of cases (5%). Twenty two percent of A(H1N1)pdm09 detections have been among elderly adults 65 years of age. Conversely , the majority ( 57%) of A(H3N2) detections have been among elderly adults 65 years of age, despite comprising about 18% of the population in BC1. The BCCDC PHL also conducts testing for other respiratory viruses (ORV) among specimens from select sites across the province. Other external sites perform their own ORV testing and this report does not include data from all sites across the province. Among ORV testing at the BCCDC PHL during week 1 3, respiratory syncytial viruses (n=38) were the most commonly detected (excluding influenza) (Figure 6 ). 1 Government of British Columbia, BC Stats.

BC INFLUENZA SURVEILLANCE 2018 -19 8 BC Children's and Women's Health Centre Laboratory In week 13, 111 tests for influenza and 100 tests for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) were conducted at the BC Children's and Women's Health Centre laboratory. Of these, 16 (14%) were positive for influenza A (not subtyped), 3 (3%) were positive for influenza B, and 13 (13%) were positive for RSV. Influenza A positivity has decreased considerably between week s 12 and 1 3 (26% versus 14 %, respectively ) while RSV positivity has remained relatively stable (11% vs 13%, respectively) as has influenza B positivity at around 3% (Figure 9). Figure 9: Influenza and other virus detections among respiratory specimens submitted to BC Children's and Women's Health Centre Laboratory, 2018-19 * Positive rates were calculated using aggregate data. The denominators for each rate represent the total number of tests; multiple tests may be performed for a single specimen and/or patient. BC INFLUENZA SURVEILLANCE 2018 -19 9 Influenza -like Illness (ILI) Outbreaks Eight laboratory -confirmed long- term care facility (LTCF) outbreaks of influenza A ( 7 subtype unknown and 1 influenza B ) were reported in week 13. Since week 40, a total of 76 LTCF outbreaks (22 A(H3N2), 18 A(H1N1)pdm09, 34 subtype unknown, and 2 B), 20 acute care facility outbreaks, 32 school outbreaks, 1 correctional facility outbreak, and 1 mental health facility outbreak hav e been reported ( Figures 10 and 11 ). The cumulative tally of LTCF influenza outbreaks to date this A(H1N1)pdm09- dominant season has been far below that of prior A(H3N2) -dominant seasons in 2017 -18 and 2016- 17 (76, 1 76, and 193 outbreaks, respectively). Ho wever, the number of LTCF outbreak s reported between weeks 8 and 13 represent more than a 60% increase over the cumulative tally of LTCF outbreaks reported since the beginning of the season (week 40 to week 7), consistent with increased A(H3N2) contribution in recent weeks.

BC INFLUENZA SURVEILLANCE 2018 -19 10 National FluWatch (week 12, March 17 to March 23, 2019) Influenza activity continues to be reported in almost all regions in Canada, but is circulating at higher level s in eastern areas . In week 12, the proportion of laboratory tests that were positive for influenza remained stable in comparison to week 11 at 21.8%. To date, i nfluenza A is the most common influenza virus detected in Canada (98%); the vast majority of these viruses are A(H1N1)pdm09 (81% of subtyped influenza A viruses). However, detections of influenza A(H3N2) have been steadily increasing since mid- January and accounted for the majority (72%) of subtyped influenza A detections in week 12 . There is currently very lit tle influenza B circulation compared to previous seasons. The majority (84%) of lab- confirmed A(H1N1)pdm09 detections have been reported among individuals under the age of 65. Conversely, the majority (57%) of influenza A(H3N2) detections have been reporte d among adults 65 years of age and older. Details are available at: https://www.canada.ca/en/public -health/services/ diseases/flu- Laboratory (NML): Strain Characterization From September 1, 2018 , to April 4, 2019 , the National Microbiology Laboratory (NML) has characterized 1745 influenza viruses [ 244 A(H3N2), 1445 A(H1N1)pdm09 and 56 B (22 Yamagata lineage and 34 Victoria lineage)] received from Canadian laboratories. Influenza A(H3N2): 85 influenza A(H3N2) viruses were considered antigenically similar to A/Singapore/INFIMH - 16-0019/2016, the WHO -recommended A(H3N2) component of the 2018- 19 northern hemisphere influenza vaccine. However, 29 viruses showed reduced titer with ferret antisera raised against egg- propagated A/Singapore/INFIMH -16-0019/2016. 64 influenza A (H3N2) viruses characterized belonged to genetic group 3C.2a1, 17 belonged to genetic group 3C.2a, and 32 belonged to genetic group 3C.3a. Sequencing is pending for the remaining isolate. Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09: 1404 A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses antigenically characterized were found to be similar to the A/Michigan/45/2015 virus: the WHO -recommended influenza A(H1N1) component of the 2018- 19 northern hemisphere influenza vaccine. However, 41 viruses showed reduced titer with ferret antisera raised agai nst cell culture- propagated A/Michigan/45/2015. Influenza B: 22 influenza B viruses antigenically characterized were considered similar to the B/Phuket/3073/2013 virus, which belongs to the B Yamagata lineage: the WHO -recommended influenza B component of t he 2018- 19 northern hemisphere quadrivalent influenza vaccine. The WHO -recommended influenza B component of the trivalent vaccine is a B/Colorado/06/2017- like virus of the B Victoria lineage. 15 influenza B viruses characterized were antigenically similar to B/Colorado/06/2017. 1 9 viruses showed reduced titer with ferret antisera raised against cell culture- propagated B/Colorado/06/2017. National Microbiology Laboratory (NML): Antiviral Resistance From September 1, 2018 , to April 4 , 2019 , the NML received influenza viruses from Canadian laboratories for drug susceptibility testing. Amantadine: Of the 412 influenza A viruses [ 71 A(H3N2) , 341 A(H1N1)pdm09] tested against amantadine, all were resistant. Oseltamivir: Of the 1057 influenza viruses [ 109 A(H3N2), 903 A(H1N1)pdm09, and 4 5 B] tested against oseltamivir, 1053 were sensitive, and 4 A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses with an H275Y mutation were resistant. Zanamivir: Of the 1056 influenza viruses [ 109 A(H3N2), 902 A(H1N1)pdm09, and 4 5 B] tested against zanamivir, all were sensitive. BC INFLUENZA SURVEILLANCE 2018 -19 11 International USA ( week 12, March 17 to March 23, 2019) In week 12, influenza activity decreased but remained elevated in the United States (US) . While influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 predominated from October to mid-February, influenza A(H3N2) has been more frequently reported since mid -February . Very little influenza B activity has been reported throughout the season. The majority of influenza viruses characterized antigenically are considered similar to the cel l-grown reference viruses of the 2018- 19 northern hemisphere influenza vaccine; however, an increasing proportion of influenza A(H3N2) viruses are antigenically distinguishable from the A(H3N2) component of the 2018- 19 northern hemisphere influenza vaccine. All tested viruses showed susceptibility to zanamivir and greater than 99% of the viruses tested showed susceptibility to oselt amivir and peramivir. In week 12 , the proportion of deaths attributed to pneumonia and influenza increased above the system -specific epidemic threshold. One influenza -associated pediatric death was reported in week 12 . The proportion of outpatient vis its for ILI decreased from 4.4% in week 11 to 3.8% in week 12, but remains above the national baseline of 2.2%. The US CDC has posted a summary of influenza activity in the United States and elsewhere, available at: https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/index.htm Given this late -season surge in A(H3N2) - against which the vaccine is typically less effective than other kinds of influenza viruses - on March 28th, the US CDC issued an official health advisory reminding clinicians to maintain a high index of suspicion for influenza and reinforcing early empiric antiviral use among high- risk, severely ill , or hospitalized patients with suspected or confirmed influenza illness . The full advisory can be read here: https://emergency.cdc.gov/han/han00419.asp WHO (April 1, 2019, based on data up to March 17, 2019) In the temperate zones of the northern hemisphere, influenza activity decreased overall . While increased detections of influenza A(H3N2) and B(Victoria- lineage) have been reported in recent weeks in East Asia, influenza activity has appeared to decrease overall in the United States , Europe, Southern Asia, and most countries of Western Asia. Activity continued to be reported in some countries in North Africa and was generally low in the Caribbean, Central America, and in tropical countries of South America. In the temperate zones of the southern hemisphere, influenza activity remained at inter -seasonal levels, with the exception of some parts of Australia where influenza circulation remained above inter -seasonal levels. Worldwide, influenza A has accounted for the majority of detections. Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 has predominated in East Asia and in North America; however, a shift towards A(H3N2) dominance has been observed in recent weeks. Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 predominated in Southern Asia and bot h A viruses have circulated in Europe. From March 4 2019 to March 17 2019, the WHO GISRS laboratori es tested more than 176, 726 specimens. Of these, 43,084 were positive for influenza viruses, of which 39 ,652 (92%) w ere typed as influenza A and 3, 432 (8%) as influenza B. Of the subtyped influenza A viruses, 8,769 (49.9%) w ere influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and 8,795 (50.1%) were influenza A(H3N2). Of the characterized B viruses, 119 (5.1%) belonged to the B -Yamagata lineage and 2,193 (94.9%) to the B -Victoria lineage. The full WHO report is available at: https://www.who.int/influenza/surveillance_monitoring/updates/en/ On 11th March 2019, the WHO released a Global Influenza Strategy for 2019- 2030 aimed at protecting people in all countries from the threat of influenza. The strategy aims to reduce the burden of seasonal influenza, minimize the risk and control the spread of zoonotic influenza, and prepare for (and mitigate the impact of) the next influenza pandemic. The report, Global Influenza Strategy 2019- 2030, is available at: https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/311184/9789241515320- eng.pdf BC INFLUENZA SURVEILLANCE 2018 -19 12 2018/19 Vaccine Effectiveness Estimates Canadian Mid -Season 2018- 19 Vaccine Effectiveness Estimates On January 24th, 2019, the Canadian Sentinel Practitioner Surveillance Network (SPSN) published the first mid- season estimates of influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE) for the 2018- 19 season in the northern hemisphere. The Canadian SPSN reported substantial VE of 72% (95% confidence interval (CI): 60- 81%) against medically - attended outpatient A(H1N1)pdm09 illness . Substantial vaccine protection was observed across all age groups , notably young children, who also appear ed to be disproportionately affected by this year's A(H1N1)pdm09- dominant epidemic. The Canadian interim estimate for 2018- 19 is comparable to preliminary estimates of VE against A(H1N1)pdm09 using the same vaccine component reported from Australia (78%; 95%CI: 51- 91%) for their 2018 season. It is substantially higher than reported for Canada during last year's A(H3N2) -dominant epidemic (for which VE against A(H3N2) viruses was less than 20%). Consistent with global trends, sequencing analysis of viruses collected by the Canadian SPSN showed considerable genetic diversity among circulating clade 6B.1 viruses of A(H1N1)pdm09; however, a dominant drift (immunologic escape) variant was not identified. The full report is available as an open- access publication in the online journal Eurosurveillance : https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560 -7917.ES.2019.24.4.1900055 Hong Kong Early Season Estimates - 2018/19 Vaccine Effectiveness Against Pediatric Hospitalization On January 31st, 2019, i nterim VE estimates for the 2018- 19 northern hemisphere influenza vaccine were reported from Hong Kong for the prevention of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 hospitalization in children. Authors report substantial VE of 92% (95% CI: 82-96%) against A(H1N1)pdm09- attributed hospitalisation in children (aged 6 months -17 years). This estimate is comparable to the VE estimate reported earlier by the Canadian SPSN for the prevention of medically attended outpatient A(H1N1)pdm09 illness in children 1- 8 years of age (91%; 95%CI: 67- 98%). The full report is ava ilable as an open- access publication in the online journal Eurosurveillance: https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560- 7917.ES.2019.24.5.1900056 United States (US) Interim Estimates of 2018 -19 Seasonal Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness On February 14th, 2019, mid- season VE estimates for the prevention of laboratory -confirmed influenza associated with medically -attended acute respiratory illness (ARI) were reported from the US CDC. Authors report an overall VE of 46% (95% CI: 30- 58%) against influenza A( H1N1)pdm09, which is lower than the recently reported interim VE estimates against A(H1N1)pdm09 of 72% in Canada during the 2018- 19 season and 78% in Australia during the 2018 southern hemisphere influenza season (see above). A higher VE of 62% (95% CI: 40- 75%) against A(H1N1)pdm09 among those aged 6 months to 17 years was reported in this study. Discrepancies in VE estimates across studies may be attributed to multiple factors including differences in the stage of the influenza epidemic relative to the ini tiation of the immunization campaign, variation in circulating viruses, as well as methodological differences including contributing sample sizes (and statistical power), participant profiles, and clinical outcomes assessed. The full report is available as an open- access publication in Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report : https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/68/wr/mm6806a2.htm?s_cid=mm6806a2_w Europe an Interim Estimates o f 2018- 19 Seasonal Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness On February 21, 2019, mid- season VE estimates were also reported from Europe, where there has been co- circulation of both influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2) viruses this season. VE estimates were generall y higher against A(H1N1)pdm09 than against A(H3N2) for which no vaccine protection was suggested among 3/4 studies in the outpatient setting; however, wide confidence intervals require cautious interpretation.
