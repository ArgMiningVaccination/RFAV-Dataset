MEAGHER, ASSOCIATE SUPERINTENDENTJUNIOR HIGH SCHOOLS - MIDDLE SCHOOLS itl PHILOSOPHYThis curriculum guide is another step forward in the constanteffort to rneet the needs of our pupils, teachers, and the changingtimes.Its preparation involved the talents and high professionalcompetence of many experienced teachers, as well as supervisoryand administrative personnel.The suggestions it makes rJprcling scope and sequence of subjectmatter and teaching procedures are the product of carefully consideredjudgments as to what pupils should learn in certain areas and howbest to present the material. This provides some degree of constancy, validity, and practicality to the learning-teaching process. Further, it protects the people's right to know what is being taught in the publicschools of this city.However, this necessary and desirable structuring does notmilitate in any way against the flexibility of the curriculum guide.Working around the skeletal core provided by this guide, enthusiasticand ingenious teachers will use their creativity to both adapt and ex-pand its contents. Only thus can pupils possessing a broad range ofabilities and capabilities be challenged.The effectiveness of this curriculum guide, as that of any othertool, w'll depend upon the skill of the user. It is to be hoped that all teachers will make it a vital part of the educational equipment theyuse daily, and assume a degree of personal responsibility for itsevaluation and revision. From this constant refinement, on a broadbase, there will evolve a curriculum of superior quality and everincreasing usefulness to the teachers it guides in the effective instruc-tion of all pupils.

It has been and is the indispensable factor in man's development as asodal, moral, and intellectual being. Any course of study inEnglish should, therefore, equip the student with the linguisticknowledge necessary to participate effectively in modern society.The student in the middle school is experiencing one of themost difficult phases of life, physically, emotionally, socially,and intellectually. He has left the security of the elementary schoolto enter this vague transitional period in which he must explore,experiment, and try to discover his way into an adult society.This English cu:riculum guide attempts to capitalize on theseadolescent characteristics to meet the student's needs.Any course of study must gear itself to the nature of thestudent.This particular curriculum encourages the student toexplore, discover, and experiment with his language to helphim in his initial efforts to adjust to and cope with the adult world. viii q TO Tir2, TEACHER The English program in the Junior High School and the Middle School is basedon a concept so old that it is new; that the curriculum shculd fit the student. The student's command of reading, writing, listening, and speaking skills must alwaysbe the dominant factor in deciding what to teach, when to teach it, and the techniquesin teaching it.With this concept in mind, the committee has provided a flexible structure withsufficient options to accommodate the slowest and the most gifted of students. The judicious choice and use of alternative materials from the suggested and supplementarylists in meeting the additional needs of the students is left to the wisdom and discre-tion of the teacher.The teacher must accept the fact that he cannot adhere to a fixed or rigid sch-edule nor can this committee prescribe such a schedule. On the other hand, thiscommittee must and does require minimum standards of achievement and, teachersmust see that their students meet these requirements.The objectives set forth M this document are to be considered as the minimumstandard. A teacher, for example, should never feel that he cannot refine a skill,heighten a perception, provide a greater insight, or meet further objectives becausehe will be impinging on the province of next year's teacher. The teacher must alwayshe prepared to enrich, develop, sad expand this material as the individual talents ofthe students dictate.In meeting the objectives in this curriculum guide, it is expected that the studentdevelop his mind more than his memory. Therefore, the inductive method will beused unless, after careful e7amination and reexamination, it is decided that a part-icular objective cannot be met using the inductive approach.For the sake of new teachers, the following suggestions are made:1.Make use of diagnostic tests.2.Set specific mectives in each lesson.3.Make the student aware of the objective (s) to be met and thecriteria to ba met for evaluation.4.Provide variety in daily and weekly planning.5.Integrate the language, composition, and literature materialsas they were meant to be integrated.8.Use the teacher's manual to the texts as a tool, a resource andstimulus for your creativity.7.Emphasize constantly the learning of skills and the acquisitionof good study habits.In the past the conscientious and dedicated teacher accepted the standards ofthe curriculum guide as a starting point and set his sights by the stars; the teacherof today can do no less. ix10 CONCERNING SUGGESTED TEXTS It should be borne in mind that the criteria for selecting texts are based uponthe assumptions underlying the various slactiolis of this course of study.LANGUAGEThe choice of a language text generally revolves about grammar, usage, andthe history of language. To the extent that these aspects are included, the committeeis inclined to recommend a given language text, depending, of course, upon otherfactors such as format, integration with literature and composition, excellence oftreatment, etc.The committee also assumes that grammar will not be confused withthe more prescriptive usage, nor will it be equated with the subject English. Whetherthe approach be traditional, structural, or transformational, grammar is now recog-nized as a self-contained, descriptive science of language, not intended to be presentedas \"proof\" of liguistic correctness. Finally, it is assumed that the broad study, linguistics, including less traditional aspects of secondary school English such assemantics, etymology, phonology, morphology, and the history of language, is asmuch a part of English as composition, literature, or grammar.LITERATUREThe essential reason for the choice of a literature text lies simply in its con-tents.Individual selections are chosen for true literary merit, pertinence to contem-porary living, and interest value to students. Literature texts, however, are chosen primarily with the question, \"Do these texts include selections that serve the needsof Boston school children?\" Moreover, consideration has been given to the tendencyaway from anthologies and toward the organization of courses around a core book.Therefore, this curriculum increasingly inclines towards the use of paperbacks.SUGGESTED TEXTSIt should be further understood that while the inclusion of a text is by no meansa mandate for its use, neither should its exclusion be inferred necessarily to suggestunsuitability. A myriad of texts having been perused by this committee, someone'sfavorite, however, may unfortunately have been omitted. Comments upon the textsare objective and r biased in intention. If, for example, the approach of a language t'xt is designated 'traditional\", \"structural\", or \"transformational\", the terms areused for classification reasons only. An effort has been made to point out the ex-tent to which a text integrates composition, literature, and language, the approximatescholastic level at which it may be used, the extent to which its approach is inductive,its use of models and exercises, the inclusion of fine art reproductions, flexibilityin provicli 17 for the slower as well as the brighter student.C OM PCSIT ;ONBased on the following premises certain composition texts are suggested. In composition, for example, the student should, before he reaches high school, bethoroughly traine+l Li sense perception; for he cannot hope to express what is not x in his mind. This accomplished, the student should have a minimum proficiency innarrative and descriptive writing. Such minimum requirements in narrative anddescriptive writing do not, of course, exclude experience in the writing of the moreadvanced critical and expository forms by students of ability. xi The Rudy of Language INTRCDUCTION TO GRADES VI Vli, VIII AND IX Noah Webster once said, \"A living language must keep pace with improvementsin knowledge and with the multiplication of ideas.\" MAIcter continually emphasizedthat language, if constantly used, constantly chanjr point 6:lich students cannot realize too soon.This chiming nature of languagt. is the theme to be stressed in all the unitscalled \"The Study of Language \". Students must realize that linguistics is the science which studies and describes language and that all types of grammar make up only oneaspect of this study.Teachers are cautioned not to confuse the \"transformational generative grammar\", \"Study of Language\" unitis material purposely designed to assist the teacher in meeting the objective.: statedwithin it.Many students find information regarding etymology, th:.. history of language,and the inter-relationships among languages both interesting and enlightening. The teacher must cultivate in his students a desirable humanistic overview of language,not confine himself and his students to the ee:ausive prescribing of Latin-orientedrules.Students mt,st discover the nature, changes and levels of language and explorethe field of linguistics.They should not be forced to memorize lengthy lists of names,dates, places, etc. A steadily developing appreciation of the power and beauty oflanguage is to be fostered.All too often, however, the teacher cannot find all the linguistic material hewishes to have on hand as a resource. These \"Study of Language\" units are, there-fore, vital to the teacher as they supply him with important linguistic information.Other reaaFr aids, a chronology and bibliography, appear at the end of the languagesection.This material serves as a handbook of pertinent information which willenrich the teacher's presentation of all aspects of the English language. xi 1 GRADE V1LANGUAGE 14 GRADE VI THE FORMS OF COMMUNICATION\"Language most shows a man; speak, that I may see thee.\"Ben Jonson OBJECTIVESThe student will discover that oral language is the easiest and most effec-tive means of communication.The student will realize that all other forr .s of communication - gestures,facial expressions, noises - are severely limiting.The student will learn that words are combinations of sounds, and that suchcambinations are arbitrary symbols which communicate only when a mutualagreement as to their meaning exists among the users.The student will learn that English is analytic in nature, 1.e., word orderis essential to the meaning. Part IGesturesBackground:In this first section, as well as throughout the unit, the teacher should proceed .as inductively as possible.Generally the methods used should lead students to discov-er that communication without sounds leads to confusion and is highly impractical.Classroom Activity (First Phase)The teacher, through gestures only, motions a student to come forwat As the student approaches, the teacher raises his hand, using a \"Stop\" signal. The teacherthen gestures the student back to his seat. (Repeat with /.:other student.)The teacher then questions the class:a. \"Why did John and Mary cone to the front of the mum?\"b. \"Why did they stop?\"c. \"Why did they return to their seats?\"Students will probably respond, \"You told them to.\" The teacher might object,didn't say a word.\" \"Ho-v did they know what I wanted?\" Review gesture. 3151 Give the clasE other examples of gestures and have them interpret. (The salute, th,3 goodbye *rave, etc.)Classroom Activity (Second Phase)The students now realize that gestures can communicate; now it is necessaryfor them tc -discover that such paralanguage is very limited. What could be a dra-matic and effective way of communicating to any class the importance of oral lang-uage? Why not have the students attempt communication without it? The teachercould arrange a specific situation, and through carefully chosen questions lead thestudents to an awareness of what they normally take for granted.1.Select two students.Give one a copy of the following statements:a.\"T am hungry.\"b.\"My stomach aches.\"2.Tell one of the students to communicate the first idea without speak-ing or writing. The student must communicate only through gestureor facial expressions. The student should not indicate, as in cha-rades, which word comes first or last.3.After allowing the student sufficient time to prove your point askhim to go on to the second idea and again use the same procedures.The clore relationship of the two ideas should heighten the confusionand produce the desired effect.4.Allow the students to progress until you feel that they realize thefrustration of attempting to communicate through gestures.5.What happens if the student does communicate? The teacher thenemphasizes the length of time it took to communicate through ges-tures. No matter how cleverly the student employed gesture andhow quickly he communicated, simply saying it would have beenquicker.Review the situation. What caused confusion? Why did the stopsignal communicate so quickly; whereas, the student gestures com-municated slowly and vaguely? What value does gesture have incommunication? What limitations? 16 \\1 Part IIGesture and SoundBackground:The student should realize that certain sounds (exclamations) can communicatepain, joy, anguish, etc. , and that these sounds coupled with gestures can communi-cate quite vividly. They should also understand that such a form of communication isprimitive and infantile.Classroom Activity:Although it would be ideal to procefld through this lesson :nductiv )1y, the teacherrealizes best the attitudes and abilities of particular classes. Methodology, therefore, is totally at the discretion of the teacher. Part IllWordsBackground:Words are combinations of sounds which are usually familiar to the nativespeakers of a language. The native speaker of American English can usually identifya word which belongs to his language. These particular sound patterns will varyfrom language to language, but in all cases the users of a language assign meaningsto particular sounds and thus the sounds become words.Classroom Activities:1.The teacher could write the following \"words\" on the board.glizzlezdraystruyte (Russian)zwahgrubbledziekuje (Polish) (Old English) The inforniation in the parentheses is for the teacher.When the students attempt to pronounce the words, they will immediatelyrealize that some words are familiar sound patterns while others are not. The pat-terns they can pronounce are nonsense words - Ozzie, grubble, bottle, bore -;the patterns which were difficult or even linposeloTrlie meaningful worabuTnotto the native speaker of American English. The students should realize that particu-lar sound patterns are characteristic of a language,i.e., the patterns of Polish arenot the patterns of American English. 517di 2.The student now knows that he can recognize the sounds of American Eng-lish; he should now learn that these sounds must be arranged iu definite ways. Theteacher might prepare the obta(boat)repu(pure)bsoorutthh(toothbrush) oohst (shoot)uoshe (house)keta(take)Note: teacher might refer to \"Gnu Wooing\"p. 260, \"Llyric of the Llama\" p. 261 by Burgess Johnson, and \"No,Noe, Nough\" p. 259 in Directions published by Chas. Merrill andCompany.Select the first two \"words\" on the list (gdo, anm) and have the studentsindicate all the possible letter combinations for each.anmgdomna 'CogmangodnamdgonmaodgamnogdThe students sbould immediately recognize which combinations are mean-ingful and which are not. The teacher should ask why \"man\", \"dog\", and \"god\" commu-nicate while the other arrangements of the same letters do not? What do \"dog\" and\"god\" indicate about the sound arrangements in words?3.The teacher should also help the students discover that particular groupsof people develop a habit of using certain groups of sounds (man, tan, pan, can, etc. -dog, fog, tog, smog, etc.)4.The students should also realize that similar sound patterns can have dif-ferent meanings ikl various languages. ''We\" in English and Oui in French. \"See\" in English and Si in Spanish. To further emphasize just how arbitrary word mean- ing is, the teacher might tell the students that each language used its own particularsound pattern to designate r particular object: English ''dog\", French chien, Ara-bic kalbSpanish perro.5.In order to further reinforce the fact that a word is an arbitrary symbol,the teacher should initiate a cliscussi.,n on visual symbols: the flag, the skull andcross bones, the eagle, etc. Part IVWord OrderBackground:In the English language word order is essential for meaningful communication.Unlike the inflected languages such as Latin, the meaning of an English sentencecan be completely changed if word order is altered. The words in the Latin sentencePuer amat puellam can puer,Puellam puer amat, and yet anyone translating the idea into English would say,\"The boy loves the girl.\" The words in Latin can be arranged in any order becausethe inflections, the endings, indicate the function of the word in the sentence. In Eng-lish, however, my changes would communicate either a different idea or nonsense.The rative speaker of English instinctively knows that words must be arrangedin a particular way to convey meaning, but he must be constantly aware that word or-der is vital in order to avoid ambiguities and in order to be able to discuss and recog-nize at a later time stylistic variations.Classroom Activity:1.The students should be made to realize that they can recognize the ele-ments of a simple English sentence even though they cannot understal.1 the wordmeanings. The teacher might start with a quote from Lewis Carroll's \"Jabberwocky\":\"...the slithy toves did gyre and gimble in the wabe.\"The teacher might ask the following questions:a.What is the sentence talking about?b.What is the action? How do you know?c.What key words exist to help you understand? (the, did, and,in) .. The teacher might then wish to explore the sentence in more depth depend-ing upon the class situation. Although it is not really necessary at this time, theteacher might introduce some grammatical terminology.2.Other possible approaches:a.The teacher could lead tit- students in tracing the development ofan infant's speech from the early nonsense syllables and noises toisolated words, to word groups, and finally sentences.b.The student might work with the following word groups and attemptto arrange each group in different word orders to convey differentmeanings, if possible. 719. (1)the, paint, house(2)people, guys, few, like, nasty(3)hit, John, ball, the(4)football, Jack, the, is, player, best(5)trains, the, man, the, guard(6)eaten, the, by, tiger, fast, man, was, the(7)please, it, to, him, easy, is3.Student Projects:a.Small groups of students might attempt to create their own inflectedlanguage.b.Students might scramble the word order of famous quotations orlines in poetry; the class might attempt to unscramble them. THE STUDY OF LANGUAGE OBJECTIVES:The student will learn what a linguist is.The student will know what the science of linguistics does.The stuobat will understand the concept of a dyad language.The student will kilow what \"borrowings\" are.The student will be able to identify examples of \"borrowings\". Teacher Background:From the Latin word lingua, meaning tongue or language, come the Englishwords \"linguist\" and \"linguistics' , and, of course, the word \"language\" itself. \"Ling-uist\" is the word used to designate one who studies a language. More specifically,today's linguist studies according to the scientific method.The scientific method consists of:1.deciding what the problem is and what question is to be answered,2.stating this in the form of a question,3. rcollecting information, r';4.arranging the information, =5.making a tentative conclusiou,6,testing and revising,7.stating a final theory. 8 Linguistics itself is language study orthe science that examines speaking. It includes phonology, morphology, and syntax.1.Phonology (phonetics) is the study of sound systems and soundsthemselves (phonemes).2.Morphology is the study of the structure of words and units ofmeaning.3.Syntax is the study of the placement of words and word groups formeaning and the lelathmship among words and word groups insentences.Language Is speaking, a communication system using vocal symbols that havemeanings a community has agreed upon. Both anthropologists, to whom linguistics is very important, and linguists use time ana again the phrase, \"the primacy of speech\".The phrase is used to encompass the following ideas:1.In man's communication, speech came first. It is estimated that man was speaking two hundred and fifty thousand years ago, where-as the remains of man's first writings are approximately five thou-sand years old.2.Approximately ninety percent of all human communication takesplace through spoken language.3.Though we all talk, unless we are handicapped or choose not to talk,legs than half the world's people read and write.\".1.There exist between 2,500 and 2,800 languages in today's world,but many of them have no system of r(present Won in writing. .Languages have three systems: sounds, structure, and representa-tion in writing. The first two are the most important and are de-veloped orally.There are three types of linguistics: historic 1, comparative, and descriptive.I.Historical linguistics studies the development of one language fromits origins to its present form. .Comparative linguistics is the study of the features of two or morelanguages. Modern linguistic study, beginning in the late eighteenthand early nineteenth centuries in Germany, was led by Friedrich, Schlegel, Jakob Grimm, of fairy tale fame, and Franz Bopp. It wasthen called \"comparative philology\". The findings of these men ledto the classification of language families. 9 3.Descriptive linguistics, also called general or structural linguistics,is the otudy of languages as they a-.e actually spoken and the attemptto describe, through the examination of phonology, morphology,and syntax, how bey convey meaning. This study attempts to dis-cover rules that apply to all languages. The movement was led byFerdinand de Saussure, a Swiss, during the early 1900's.Linguistics is not a new study. It is probable that Sumero-Babylonia, Egypt, and Phoenecia had scholars involved in linguistic work. From the ancient Greeks wehave received numerous linguistic tracts. Plato wondered how man spoke; Aristotle defined the basic parts of the sentnce and the parts of speech. Zeno and the Stoics classified linguistics as a separate branch of philosophy, distinct unto itself. The Sophists authored and taught, for a fee, much linguistic material. Hebrew scholars,studying the Old Testament, gave birth to the field of etymology, word o,..igins.Eighteenth- and nineteenth-century scholars learned their linguistics principlesfrom two Indian language experts, Panini and Pantajali, who lived in the fourth andsecond centuries before Christ, respectively. Their examination and description of Sanskrit, which was an ancient language even then, set the groundwork for all linguis-tic study.In Alexandria and Rome ancient scholars produced volumes of linguistictexts.To the linguist, a dead language, one that is no longer used in the regular busi-ness of a community, is as importaLt an item of study as a living language. Indeed, a dead language is easier to study because what it was is finalized, whereas a livinglanguage changes constantly because of its constant use. When Panini and Pantajaliworked with Sanskrit, it was no longer used in ordinary communication. Its use was confined to temples where Hindu priests read from the Veda, religious books written inSanskrit.Sanskrit seems, at that time, to have servedrfiriinduism the same purposethat Latin fulfilled in Roman Catholicism centuries after it t eased to be spoken inordinary conversation.Languages, like civilizations, have come and gone. There are hundreds of deadlanguages, including Sanskrit, Hittite, Latin, Gothic, and classical Greek. Eachcentury has seen some languages die out. Today many of the African ind North and South American Indian tribal Languages are dying out because of the ever-increasinguse of Spanish, French, and English. There are some exceptions. Navajo, one American Indian language, picks up more speakers each year. Some languages hatecome close to dying, only to he revived. Hebrew, which is now the national languageof Israel, is one example. Israel has been very successful in reviving Hebrew, butthe Irish have had only limited success with `.iaelic. English is evidently too strong a language to be replaced.Even the limited Gaelic used is filled with English :.lorrow-ings.Of course, all languages borrow iron. each other. English is filled with wri4t are called borrowings, words, prefixes, suffixes, and riots taken from one languageinto another. One of the distinguishing characteristics of the English language is thehabit of borrowing which was established in tile Middle English period. Today English is borrowed from, more than it borrows, indicating its importance among the world's 10 ;T2 languages. Though the French Academy frowns on \"un2c,-..c,ptable\" words such .3 lehot dog,les blue jeans, and le drugstore, the French use them widely. Italian, Spanish, Japanese, and even Russian have English borrowings as part of their vocab-ularies.Thousands of English words are classified as hybrids, that is they contain rootsfrom two or more languages. \"Automobile\", for example, is a combination of theGreek prefix \"auto\" and the Latin root \"mobiles\".This fixed habit of borrowing from other languages accounts for the fact that inits current vocabulary of approximately 600,000 words, contemporary English con-tains more Latin, Greek, and French words than it does Old English (Anglo-Saxon)words.Logically enough, however, the most used words in English are predominant-ly Anglo-Saxon. Of the thousand most used words in English, six hundred twenty fallinto the Anglo-Saxon category.Some examples of borrowings which show the international flavor of contempo-rary American English are:From Greece:psychology, monarchy, logic, comedy, tragedy, asparagus, cyclone,elephant, xylophone, encyclopedia, philosophyFrom Rome:compute, part, fragile, separate, masculine, feminine, educate, drama,vacuum, altar, temple, school, sock, priestFrom Scandinavia:sky, gift, will, skirt, ugly, scrap, call, they, them, theirFrom Wales:cardigan, flannelFrom France and French explorers:prairie, tax, etiquette, renaissance, chowder, empire, treaty, judge,jury, male, female, veal, tacon, depot, caribou, cabbage, royal,frail, buccaneerFrom Arabia:zero, algebra, admiral, assassin, hashish, guitar, almanac 11 23 From Italy and Italian immigrants:broccoli, pizza, balcony, design, macaroni, solo, antipasto, ravioli,granite, stanza, spaghetti, pasta, canteen, violin, volcano, aria, frescoFrom the Netherlands and Dutch settlers:cookie, tt4, chile, coyote,rodeo, mantilla, alligator, cafeteria, marijuana, banana, potato, tobacco, California, tornado, canyon, plazaFrom Iadia:dungarees, madras, shawl, cashmere, loot, zombie, realize that society dictates standard usage and whilethere may be nothing \"incorrect\" about some of the expressions withinhis own group, ; such usage mii,ht not be found acceptable by othersocial and business groups.The student will realtza that a person's use of language reveals moreabout him than physical appearances or material possessions. Theway a person uses his language characterizes him for better or worse. Background:The problems in tisag_c will often vary with the backgrounds of the students sothat the teacher must modify any unit on usage tc the needs of aparticular class orperhaps even an individual vrithin'that clasr,. 13 Sample Problems in UsageVerb forms:a.Lack of agreement and are\"\"between for \"between students might examine the language used by a variety of character; on atelevision show. How does the character's use of language characterize him? Whatcharacters tend to use expressions which are not standard? 14 2 WORD STUDY OBJECTIVES:The student will be able to distinguish between. general and specific terms,and learn to usi the specific word.The student will distinguish between the concrete and the abstract termand will learn to be cautious in his use of the abstract term unless ithas been carefully defined.The student will be able to define synonym, antonym, and homonym.The student will know the differeces in the spelling and meaning of cer-tain homonym groups.The student will enrich a.id increase his vocabulary. Part 1General and_aiecific WordsBackground:Students in grade six realize nat word order is essential to meaningful commu-nication. Although words in logical or natural order cal communicate, title: a group-ing does not always ensure clear and effective communication. The student must notremain satisfied with the trite and the vague. The teacher must make the studentaware of the wealth of word choices available in English and must also demand thatthe student use the specific term.Suggested Classroom ActivitiesThe following terms are general:walk, sit, say, lc,ok, soft, man, child, drink.The teacher might prepare a list of the words and perhaps use the word \"walk\"in a few sentences.a.He walked to school.b.The boy walked in the parade.c.The boy walked quietly to school.The students might be asked if \"walk\" communicates the same meaning in eachsentence. They should realize that the boy would not be \"walking\" in the same man-ner on each occasion. For example, 15 a,The boy trudged to school.b.The boy stitted in the parade.C.The boy tiptoed to escape detection.How many more specific terms can the studerts provide for the general term\"walk\"?Sample:GeneralSpecificwalkanFIT,strut, saunter, stroll, stride, stagger,shuffle, trudge, prance, limp, tiptoeThe student 1.houid realize that the specific term creates an image, i.e. , a per- son can visualize how the boy is walking. The students should now provide specificterms for the rest of the words on the list. If the teacher wishes to provide another example, the word \"say\" might be used. The term is constantly used in conversationand yet people \"say\" things in many different ways.Sample:GeneralSpecificsaydemand, plead, utter, stammer, drawl, promise,threaten, stutter, declareThe teacher may very easily check to see if the students realize the distinitionbetween the general and the specific. Simply give a list of terms and have the stu- dents identify them. Part IIThe Use of Specific Terms and the Composition of the SentenceBackground:The study of specific synonyms has little value if the students do not practiceusing such terms in sentences. They should be able to recognize when the diction in a sentence is too general and learn to revise from general to specific.Suggested Classroom ActivitiesStudents should attempt to rewrite the following sentences in order to createmore vivid images:1.A truck was parked in the street.2.Our relatives have a place in the country.3.His room was a mess.4.The little boy was standing in the yard. 162f Sample revisions:1.The grimy, gray garbage truck was double-parked in the narrowside-street.2.Our Uncle Ephraim and Aunt Hepzibah have a one room log cabinin the Green Mountains.3.The boy's usually neat bedroom was cluttered with colorful giftwrappings and empty boxes.4.The smiling little boy was leaning against the birch tree in his frontyard staring at the bluejay in the bird bath.The teacher should impress upon tha students that adding specific detail is notpadding the sentence; it is an attempt to be clear and precise.Other Suggested Classroom Activities1.The students might investigate the types of words used in advertising.Are the words specific or general? Why does a particular commer-cial select particular words ?2.Better students might check the dictionary to discover the distinc-tions which exist among synonyms.Correlate the study of specific words with composition by supplyingmore general sentences for revision. Part IIIConcrete and Abstract WordsBackground:The classroom teacher knob ,q Jest the ability of a particular class and therefore can determine the depth of any disc,,ssion of abstract terms. Most students, however,should be able to distinguish between concrete and abstract and should realize that theuse of abstract terms without clear definition will often hinder effective communication.Suggested Classroom Activities: Enrichment Activities for Better Students1,In order to dramatize the ambiguity of many of the abstract terms,the teacher might ask the students to write their own definiticais ofsuch terms as \"love'', \"liberty\", \"hatred\", etc. A variety of defi-nitions will probably result. The teacher might also provide exam-ples from the newspaper or from various magazines to demonstratethe various meaairgs of terms such as \"democratic\", \"free,\" \"lawand order\", and if possible show the confusion which can result whenthese abstract terms are used without clear definition. 17 2.The students might take their cue from the teacher's demonstrationand use the newspapers and magazines to eFamine the use of abstractterms. Part IVSyno,.yms and AntonymsBackground:Students have already dealt with synonyms in the section on general and specificwords, so the concentration should be on the antonym. Students should be able to de-fine \"antonym\", and if a vocabulary list is kept, they should include the antonyms ofthe words on their list. Part VHomonymsBackground:Homonyms - words which souni alike but have different meanings and spellings -can cause problems for the student in his written composition. The following is a listof common homonyms. The students should know the meanings of the words and learnto spell and use the called homophones. Another term,homographs, is used to mean words written the same, some-tinibs pronounced the same, which have different meanings.(e. g,, \"record\" as in \"Recoi.cl the information.\" and new \"lie\" as in \"Tie your shoe.\" and a \"tiescore.\") 18 WORD CLASSIFICATION OBJECTIVES:The student will know the difference between lexical and structure(function) words.The student will realize that the lexical words are classified as nouns,pronouns, verbs, and modifiers (adjectives and adverbs).The student will learn to identify the classification of a term by its lexical,functional, and morphological characteristics.The student will learn the various ways plurals are formed.The student will know and understand the function of the pronoun andthree types of pronouns: personal, interrogative, and indefinite.The student will be able to identify a verb, the combination of a verband its auxiliary, and the three types of verbs.The student will be able to identify the modifiers - the adjective andadverb - and will be able to form the comparative and superlativedegrees.The student will understand the function of the determiners, preposi-tions, and coordinating conjunctions. Background:In order to discuss and analyze the sentence and its parts, the students mustlearn a vocabulary of grammar. Such a vocabulary should start with the classifica-tion of words. Such a classification will have two basic divisions: (1)lexical words or words wit:. meaning - nouns, pronouns, verbs, modifiers, and (2) stWarire orfunction words that are vital to the structure and meaning of a sentence but have littlemeaning in themselves - determiners, conjunctions, prepositions.Part INounsI.Methods of Identification:a.Lexical:A noun is the name of a person, place, thing,idea, quality, or action. 19 PT1 b.Functional:A noun, or its substitute, the pronoun, is theonly part of speech which can be the subject ofthe verb or the object of the verb or preposi-tion.Nouns are also the only class of wordswhich can be preceded by a determiner: the,a, or an.c.Morphological:There are suffixes which are characteristic ofthe noun class,(See section on prefixes andsuffixes.)2.Types of Nouns:a,Properb.Commonc.Collectived.Concretee.Abstract3.The Formation of Plurals4.The Formation of the Possessives Part HVerbs1.Methods of Identification:a.Lexical:A verb is a word that states action, being, orstate of being.b.Rinctional:The verb is essential to the sentence and indi-cates the action, links the subject to a word inthe predicate, or is an auxiliary in a verbphrase.Morphological:(See prefixes and suffixes.)Types of Verbs:a.Transitiveb.Intransitivec.Linking 20 Part IIIPronounsI.The class of pronouns includes that relatively small group of Englishwords which can be used as substitutes for nouns.2.Some types of pronouns are:a.Personalb.Interrogativec.Indefinite Part IVThe Modifiers: Adjectives and of Identification; - Although adjectives and adverbs have mean-ing, they are best identified through their functions. An adjective limitsor modifies a noun or preaoui and will generally precede the noun in sen-tences. An adverb modifies a verb, adjective, or another adverb.2.Comparison of Adverbs and Adjectives:a.Positive, comparative, superlativeb.Irregular forms, as: good, better, bestbad, worse, worstlittle, less, least Part VStructure Or Function WordsThe structure words should not be studied in isolation since they have littlemeaning outside the sentence structure. The students should not memorize . list ofprepositions, conjunctions, or de( .miners, but should be able to identify themthrough their structural function in the sentence.As in the case of the use of the coordinating conjunctions, the accurate use ofthe preposition should be stressed.Suggested Classroom Activities for Word ClassificationTextbooks will provide the teacher and the students with sufficient materials forthe study of the word classes. Excessive drill should be avoided. 21 DICTIONARY SKILLS OBJECTIVE:The student will develop skill and efficiency in using the dictionary. 1.Alphabetizing - by initial, second, third, fourth letter, etc.2.Use of guide words3.Skill in syllabication as an aid to pronunciation and spelling4,Knowledge of dictionary symbolsa.abbreviations - parts of speech, singular, plural, languagesymbols (L., Gr., Fr.)b.pronunciation of phonetic spellingsNote: Transparencies by Field Publications, inc. and by S. R. A. , and Filmstrips by Encyclopedia Brittanica are all available and arehighly recommended. PREFIXES AND SUFFIXES OBJECTIVE:The student will know and recognize prefixes and suffixes. Background:Since a student cannot rely entirely on the use and availability of a dictionaryevery tinie he meets a new word, he will have to learn how to infer the meanings ofwonio. A knowledge of common prefixes and suffixes gives the student clues to themeanings of thousands of English words. 22 Obviously students will become confused ii they are asked to memorize lists ofprefixes and suffixes.For this reason, the section on prefixes and suffixes is not de-signed to be taught as a u.ut. Instead it should be divided into small segments that can be presented over an extended period of time, perhaps in weekly lessons or inte-grated into other areas of language study.Suggested Classroom Activities1.Students are more likely to remember the meanings of a prefix or a suf-fix if they can examine a group of words containing the same prefix or thesame suffix.For example, to introduce students to prefixes, the teachermay write the following groups of words on the board:unarmundounrollunbendunfoldunscrewuncaputhitchunsnap unchainunlockuntieuncorkunlooseunwindHave students study the words for a moment to discover what they all have incommon. They should discover that they all have the same prefix, \"un\", all haveonly two syllables, and all are verbs. Ask students what effect the common prefixhas on each verb. They should be able to discover with little difficulty that the pre-fix \"un\" reverses the action of each verb. Students will be able to add more verbs to the list, some containing more than two syllables.2.The prQfix \"un\" can also precede adjectives, adverbs, and sometimesnouns. When used with these parts of sp2ech it means \"not\" or \"opposedto\".Follow the same procedure as with the first list of words:unableunattachedunaware unbearableunbelievableuncertainunemployedunexpecteduncertaintyunfeelinglyunknownunlinedunsafeunsafelyunsureIf students used each of the words in sentences, they wonld see that some func-tion as nouns, some as adjectives, ar... some as adverbs. Again, they should be ableto add many words to the List.PrefixesNumberDirectionNegativemiladuncentsubimunitransitbi (di)exin triinil OBJECTIVES;The student will know it.at all sentences contain two essential elements:subject and predicate.The student will learn the basic sentence patterns.The student will reallze that interrogative, negative, and passive sen-tence constructions are transformations of the basic patterns.The student will be able to distinguish between simple and compoundsentences.The student will learn the coordinating conjunctions or coordinatorsand realize that each coordinator performs a particular function whichwill alter the meaning of the sentence. Background:Since the sentence is the basic unit of communications the speaker or writershould be aware of its nature :.nd its possible variations.Part IThe Two Essential Parts: Subject and PredicateSuggested Classroom ActivitiesI.Prepare a list of relatively short sentences and have the students divideeach list into subject and predicate.2.Prepare a list which will offer only the subject or the predicate and havethe students supply the missing element. Part IIBasic Sentence PatternsBackground:Most linguists agree; that there are basic sentence patterns; however, they maydiffer in the number of sentences they list, and they do vary the terminology used todescribe the elements within the sentences. The four basic patterns or kernel sen-tences offered as examples below are generally agreed to and the terminology used istraditional. 25 other sentence structures are built upon or generated from the four kernelseither through the addition or deletion of words of through the change of the word posi-tions (transformations). Note that all basic patterns are simple declarative sentences.Suggested Classroom Activities1.The students should compose their own kernel sentences.2.The teacher might prepare a list of sentences which will include bothbasic patterns and transformations of basic patterns. The students should identify which sentences are kernels .end explain what has hap-pened to those which are not. Part IIIInterrogative, Negative, and Passive ConstructionsSuggested Classroom Activities1.:The teacher should perform some simple transforms for the students'benefit. The following are samples:a.Basic patternThe boy hits the ball.NegativeThe boy dees not hit the ball.InterrogativeDoes the boy hit the ball?PassiveThe ball was hit by the boy.b.Basic patternThe man snores.NegativeThe man does not snore.InterrogativeDoes the man snore?c.Basic patternThe girl is pretty.NegativeThe girl is not pretty.InterrogativeIs the girl pretty? 26 2.Students should construct transforms of their own basic sentence patterns.3.The te:.cher might ask the following questions:a.What must be added to all but the linking verbs when the interrogativeis formed? When the negative is formed?b.Why is it impassible to construct the passive sentence with the in-transitive and linking verbs?Part IVSimple SentencesThe teacher should review the structure and nature of the simple sentence andreview the types of sentences: declarative, interrogative, imperative, and exclama-tory. Such a review might also include a discussion of intonation. Part VCompound SentencesBackground:The student should know the important coordinating conjunctions o: coordinatorsand should practice the appropriate use of each in order to eliminate the constant useof \"and\".The coordinators: and, but, yet, or, nor, for, so, either-or, neither -nor .Students should not just memorize the coordinators; they should learn how touse them.Suggested Classroom Activities1.The teacher might provide exercises in which the coordinating conjunc-tions are omitted. The students should complete the sentences and beable to provide reasons for their choice of conjunctions.2.At this time the students should learn the proper punctuation of the com-pound sentence.3.The teacher might also discuss the problem of the run-on sentence. LOGIC AND ADVERTISINGBackground:The young people of the mid-twentieth century have more purchasing power thanthe young of any other generation, and, therefore, have become targets. Television 27 and radio commercials aim directly at these young people. Since the students are constantly subject to the sales pressure of these media, they should develop a cri-tical attitude toward the commercial.Prior to any investigation of the nature of television and radio commercials,the student must become acquainted with some basic rules of logic and methods ofrhetoric which will serve as the basis for the developmint of logical thinking. Part iFact and Opinion OBJECTIVES:The student will learn to distinguish between fact anti opinion.The student will learn to evaluate opinions. Background:There are obviously manyactivitiesateacher may select to develop this basis oflogical thought, but all will agree that it is necessary to provide a definition of terms.Ideally, the approach to the definitions of fact and opinion should be inductive; realis-tically, the approach in many cases will be deductive.Suggested Classroom ActivitiesThe students will determine which of the following statements are fact and whichare opinion and hopefully give the reasons for their decisions.1.Lisa is the most beautiful girl in town.2Lisa is five foot two and has blue eyes.3.John is the terror of the neighborhood.4.John is three years old.5.Ted Williams is the greatest baseball player who ever lived.6.The Scots are the stingiest people in the world.7.Columbus discovered America in 1492.8.ColumbuP came to America in 1492.9.George Washington was the first President of the United States.10.Thomas Jefferson was the best President of the United States.A longer list could be made and one will probably be needed, but the teachermight have the students quiz one another as to whether statements made in the class-room are fact or opinion. 28 The students should realize that facts are verifiable and will demand agreementfrom all, while opinions cannot be completely verified and do not demand generalagreement. Part IIEvaluating Opinions.111..OBJECTIVE:The student will undereta_nd that opinions based on fact and spoken by acompetent person in the particular field deserve consideration. Suggested Classroom ActivitiesThe students should decide which speaker is in the better position to offer themore valid \u00b0gallon.Statement Whose opinion is more valid?1.\"Joe, if you work hard atpractice, you are going tobe a great ballplayer!\"2.\"The Fiat is the best carmoney can buy.\" 3.'It's go$D.g to be a long,hard winter.\"4.\"There is life on mars.\"Joe's father, who is an Englishteacher, or Joe's coach, who is aformer major leaguer ?Joe Proud, who has uwned threeFiats in ten years, or Mike Meehan,the auto mechanic who has workedon all car models?A meteorologist, or an old farmer? The science fiction writer, or thescientist? Part IIIFact and Opinion in AdvertisingBackground:The purpose of the first two sections was to provide a rather simple, but yetpractical, logical basis for a sixth grade study of the advertising aspect of radio andtelevision commercials. 29 t Suggested Classroom ActivitiesEach student or small groups of students should report on five commercials(or a number decided by the teacher). Both radio and television should be included. The student sliould be ready to answer the following questions and defend his opin-ions?1.Is the statenient made about the product fact or opinion?2.If it is opinion, is the commercial tioating it as such or is ittrying to pass it off as fact?3.Who is the speaker in the commercial? Is he or she qualified tooffer an opinion that deserves attention?4.Can you offer any reason why a particular personality is the speak-er in the commercial? (Why does Miss Jean on Romper Roomspeak for toys ? Carl Yastrzemski, shaving cream ? Bob Richards,Wheaties ? Arthur Godfrey, Axior ? Ben Cartwright, for Chevrolet?) Part IVTypes of Commerdals OBJECTIVES:The student will realize that radio and television commercials are directedat a particular audience, and the audience determines the method of deliver-ing the message.The student will be aware of various types of commercials: the testimon- ial, the bandwagon, the purposely comical, etc. Background:Teachers should explain that the sole purpose of the commercial advertisementis to create a desire on the part of a panicuIar audience to purchase a specific product.The advertiser must then make certain that his commercial is directed at an audiencewho can afford and perhaps use the product, and that the commercial must be writtenand dramatized in a manner which will appeal to that particular audience, must bepresented at a time when a majority of that group will be listening or watching, andmust sponsor a program whose content appeals to that audience. 30 Suggested Classroom Activities1.Students should view particular types of television presentations: news,sports, soap operas, children's shows, etc. and listen to a variety ofradio stations whose broadcasting policies differ: rock and folk, talkshow, pop music, and classical music stations. Students should then attempt to catalogue the products which are advertised on each type ofpresentation and on each type of station. Perhaps the following ques- tions may serve as a guide:a,What products are advertised on sports presentations?b.What do these products have in common?c.At what audience are they directed?2.What types of presentations are there ?a.Students should examine how many commercials feature personal-ities from show business or the sports worli. Why is a particularpersonality chosen for a particular product? Can the students dis-cover to what type of audience the person should appeal?b.The student should also find examples of the following types ofcommercials:(1)Bandwagon: This type of commercial urges its audience to'get with it,\" to follow the crowd.(2)The demonstration:I you tie watch to an outboardmotor ?\" 3143 GRADE VIILANGUAGE 3344 GRADE VII ORIGINS OF LANGUAGE Part ITheories of Language Origin OBJECTIVES:The student will explore the various theories of language origin.The student will discover the unscientific nature of such theories.The student will investigate the basic problems in tracing language origin. Background:... Any study Into the origins of language is necessarily considered highlyspeculative because no evidence can be collected before written language.There is, however, little mystery about the origin of written language. The oldestwritten language records are Sumerian, dating from aboutf800 B.C. Writtenlanguage was created as a substitute and auxiliary to spoken language.It developed from trade and the need to keep records. Written language is, therefore, relatively new. Oral language, on the other hand, has been estimatedto have existed on earth as early as two hundred and fifty thousand years ago.Because of the lack of evidence as to the origin of oral language, scholarscould at best make \"educated guesses\" about its origin. None of these theories is accepted in its entirety, since each is limited in its scope. All \"scientific\"theories about the origin of language remain unprovable. The labels that scholarsthemselves have attached to such theories suggest their unscientific nature.I.The \"Bow-Wow\" Theory. Language originated from the imitation ofsounds in nature.Man's first words were onomatopoeic ones splash, buzz,etc.). A dog's bark sounded like\"bow-wow\", so man designated the dog as bow-wow. However, the samesound may be interpreted differently by different peoples. (English cock-a-doodle-do, French- cocorico Italian - chtchirichi, all dif-ferent peoples' interpretation of the sound of a rooster).2.The \"Ding-donr Theory. A mystic connection exists between soundand meaning. When man first saw a dog, he immediately said \"dog\"because the sound seemed to fit the object. (Again, difieiA peo- ples seemed to find different sounds to fit the same object: Dog ischien in French, perro in Spanish, and cants in Latin). 35r; 3.The \"Pooh-pooh\" Theory. Language originated from exclamationsand interjections fear, pleasure, pain, etc.(Oh:, Ugh:, etc.)4.The \"Yo-ho-ho\" Theory. Language of physical exertion.5.The \"Sing-song\" Theory.Language originated from primitive,rhythmic chants, parallel to the sounds animals make during courting.6.The \"Ta-ta\" Theory. Language arose from the attempt to mimicgestures and bodily movements with the mouth and face. Thelips, tongue, and jaw mimic the gestures of the hands. These move -ments combined with sound created language. (Darwin's theory)7.The \"Goo-goo\" Theory, Any sound uttered eventually gainsmeaning and leads to the development of language. Thisparallels the baby talk of infants.8.The \"Go-Go\" Theory.Language originated \"break\", \"kill\", etc.Thus, not nouns as suggestedin the \"Ding-dong\" theory.Since each theory obviously shows limitations, this approach to thediscovery of language origin has proved impractical. As a result, most modernlinguists have agreed that such theoretical attempts are futile, and recentresearch has more or less given up the search for the origin of language.Student Enrichment Activities1.Oral, written, and group reports defending or attacking thevarious theories.2.Humorous illustrations of any or all of the theories.3.investigate the history of written language. (Sumerian andBabylonian cuneiform, Egyptian hieroglyphics, Sanskrit,Pheonecian alphabet, etc.)4.Examination and discussion of the scientific method.5.Creation of original theories of language origin. 6.Investigation of prehistoric cave paintings as a form ofwritten language and Indian picture language.7.Diagrams, reports, and illustrations of the physiology ofvocal apparatus and the speech :enters of the brain. 36 1 8.Read related literature- \"By the Waters of Babylon\" by StephenVincent Benet.9.Investigate research on animal communication:a.insects- the honey bee, arts, etc.b.birds- \"talking\" birds, migration, bird callsc.apes - the gibbon ape, orangutan, gorilla, chimpanzeed.porpoises 10.Related literature - fiction and non-fiction dealing withunusual and intelligent animals. Part RProtospeech - The Indo-European Language OBJECTIVES:The student will understand the concept of language families.The student will recognize the importance and magnitude of the Indo-EuropeanLanguage Family in particular.The student will develop an understanding of the growth and change of theoriginal language and how it relates to his language. Background:Since \"scientific\" guesswork proved impractical in the investigation ofthe origins of language, linguists began to approach the problem from the smallamounts of evidence available in written language records. The search turnedto the concept of a basic, universal tongue that was the common ancestor of alllanguages. This concept of language arose from various sources. One,certainly, was the Bible: \"And the whole earth was of one language and of onespeech... ,until at Babel, ... the Lord did therefore confound the language of allthe earth.\" (Genesis 11)Actual investigation into the theory began as early as the 1500's when tradedeveloped between India and the Italian city of Venice. Aroused by storiesof adventure, the Italian write... Sassetti visited the east. In the course of his travels and writing, he bt:came aware of similarities between hisnative Italian and Sanskrit, tl.e ancient and scholarly tongue of India.For example, Sassetti discovered that the Italian word for \"seven\", setti,showed similarity to the same word, tivta in Sanskrit. The Italian w7iTior \"snake\" was serpe, while in Sanskrit-WT(7mnd it to be sarpa. These and 37 elq other similarities among key words led Sassetti and later scholars to beginthinking of the idea of a \"mother\" tongue from which all languages werederived.The concept became a definite study when in 1786 Sir William Jones, anEnglish linguist, discovered that most of the languages of Eurasia (Europe,India, and Persia) were members of the same linguistic family. Linguists in the early nineteenth century began to analyze ancient Sanskrit. They discoveredsimilarities between Sanskrit, ancient C7eek and Latin, and other Europeanlanguages.The word \"me\", for example, had the same meaning in Sanskrit,Greek, Latin, Persian, and Celtic. Other key words were traced through several languages. One word serves to illustrate the process:Sanskrit - bhrataPersian -Celtic - and t..sted through scientific methods, led tothe conclusion that there was a common ancestor to most European and someAsian languages.This \"mother\" tongue was labelled Indo-European.Approximately one hundred and thirty languages stem from the originalIndo-European mother tongue. Among these are ancient languages lii a Sanskrit,Greek, and Latin, and modern tongues like English, French, Spanish, Italian,Portuguese, and Armenian.Through their examination of languages within the family, linguists wereable to reconstruct the Indo-European language as it must have been.Eventually, they reconstructed about two thousand words. They used these keywords to discove\" what kind of people the Indo-Europeans were. For example, all the languages that came from the mother tongue had similar words forwinter, cold, and snow. The scholars, therefore, assumed that the Incio-European came from a relatively cold climate. To support this assump-tion they offered the fact that no Indo-European words were found fo? lion, tiger,monkey, rice, or bamboo, all items found in a warm climate. There were Indo-European words for aspen, oak, beech, bear, wolf, beaver, sheep, eagle, hawk,owl, and bee.Considering that no beech trees or bees are found east of the BlackSea, and that there wab no Indo-European word found for ocean, scholars placedthe origin of the Indo-European people inland in the area of eastern Europe orsouthwestern Russia.(Other researchers place their origin in Persia.)Many Indo-European words reveal facts about the life of the Indo-Europeanpeople.Their wordsand melg indicate that they had cows that gave milk.Similarly, owl (ewe)anewana rridreate that they had sheep from whom theygathered wool, which theiiiiirlearned to webh (weave) and siw. 38 44! 1Betwee.i 3000 and 2000 B.C. the Indo-Europeans began to migrate,They carried first stone and then bronze weapons. During their migration theyconquered many Stone Age peoples. The reason for their migration remains a mystery.It could have been caused by a natural disaster, overpopulation,or invasion by other tribes.In any event, It is believed that some Indo-Europeans migrated southeast towards Persia, and India; others migratedsouth towards tha Mediterranean, and others north towards the North Sea.As they migrated. they carried the Indo-European language with them.Thus, the language spread throughout Eurasia. By 1700 F.C. the Indo-Europeans had conquered all of Europe and imposed their language on theconquered peoples.Today, one half of the world's population speaks languages derived fromthe original Indo-European tongue. With a knowledge of key Indo-Europeanwords, linguists have been able to trace its influence on other languages.The Indo-European word mat is one of these words. Its influence illustratesdramaticolly the wide dispersion of the Indo-European - - mairtaLithuanian - moterPersian - matar Other key Indo-European words can be traced in the same manner. Rad( gnaw) has come down to English in the words razor, erase, rat, and rodent. Mel (grind) has been traced to the words molar, meal (ground grain), and mill.TE(1 stretch) has been traced to tense, tent, and tendon.Indo-European words can enter a language through other languages withinthe family, since languages borrow from one another freely. English, in particular, contains many borrowings. For example, the English word\"mother\" is derived from the Anglo-Saxon word modor, which in turn, isderived from the Indo-European mat. The same won mat, however, became mater in Latin. From the LatinTaivative, English borrowed such terms asER-anal, maternity, matron, matrimony, matricide, and mrriarchy.The research associated with the discovery, reconstruction, andanalysis of the Indo-European protospeech has proved far more valuable thanearlier theorizing.Indo-European has offered insights into the history of notonly English, but also all the other tongues derived l.-orn the mother language.Its contribution to language study has elevated such study to the level of a science. The science of linguistics offers an extremely valid approachto the study of humanity through a un'quely human media, language. 39 1 49,3: Student Enrichment Activities1.In most Indo-European languages the numerals one to tenand the words of close family rela'ionships (mother, father,sister, brother) show similarities. Students can investigate these key words and attempt to reconstruct their own Indo-European words.2.Investigate and trace Greek and Latin word borrowings and theetymology of English words.3.Read related literature: Greek, African, and AmericanIndian creation myths, Biblical stories (Genesis and the Tower of Babel).4.Encyclopedia research on Indo-European, Sanskrit, etc.5.Map work indicating the origin and migratory routes of theIndo-Europeans and the languages within the Indo-EuropeanFamily.6.Investigate other language families:a.Sino-Tibetan Family. Second largest languagefamily.Includes Chinese, Thai, and Tibetan.Seven hundred million speakers.b.Semitic Family. One hundred fifty million speakers.Arabic, Hebrew, and North African Berber tongues.c.Uralic-Altaic Family. One hundred million speakers.Finnish, Hungarian, Turkish, and Mongol.d.Japanese-Korean Family. One hundred thirtymillion speakers.e.Dravidian Family.Languages of southern India.One hundred fifty million speakers.f.Malayo-Polynesian Family. Languages of Indonesia,Hawaii, Phillippines, New Zealand, and most of theislands of the Pacific and Indian Oceans. Onehundred fifty million speakers.g.Mon-Khmer Family.Languages of Southeast Asia,Thirty million speakers.h.African Negro Languages. 40 '50 into families: Bantu,and IIIFeatures of Human Language OBJECTIVES:Fifteen million IThe student will know and understand the features of human language(speech):1.Human language has to be learned.2.Human language depends on agreement for meaning andunderstanding.3.Human language transcends the limitations of time andspace.4.Human language has an incredible variety of phoneticresources.5.Human language is symbolic. The fundamental feature of human language is that it has to be learned.Animal sounds are inborn and remail essentially the same wherever a particularspecies exists. The dog's bark has remained the lame over thousands ofyears. Human language has changed drastically and is still changing. Anelephant born in a Boston zoo makes the same trumpeting sound as an elephantborn in the jungles of Africa or India. Incredible variety exists in human languagz; among language families, individual languages within a family,and levels within specific languages.Suggested Classroom Activities1.The student should be led to discover what human language would belike if it followed the same pattern as animal communication. 4151 2.Trace the development of infant speech from discovery andexperiment with sound, baby talk, single word:, phrases, andfinally, sentences. Ask students to gather evidence from theirown younger sisters and brothers.3.Students should discover that language is learned throughimitation. Studies of isolated children have proven that a childrearTdEY animals, abandoned to live on its own, or otherwiseisolated from humaY, society fails to develop speech.4.Discuss with students how they learn a foreign language, and howthey learn new words.Human language depends on agreement within each linguistic community.The relationship between the sound and meaning of a word depends on localconvention.Learning to talk is a matter of learning the meaning attachedto certain vocal rounds.Suggested Classroom Activities1.Again, trace the development of infant speech. Why does a babygive up \"baby talk''? Why does he make errors in pronouncingwords? Students should discover that infants must learn thevocal \"code' of the adults around him. How does he use theprocess of trial and error?2.Vocabulary from foreign languages illustrates the need foragreement in order to determine meaning. The following words,listed on the board without explanation, would appear to benonsense words. Ask the students to pronounce tho words andattach meanings to them.krzeslo of these words becausethe sound \"code\" is different from that of English. They will see no meaninbecause they have not agreed on meanings for each word. When the meaningsare attached, they can use the words correctly. Would a Japanese, Polish,or Russian person understand the words \"chair\", \"shirt\", \"bird'', etc. ?Why?(In a similar exercise the teacher could list a group of nonsense wordson the board.Have the students determine how the \"words\" are to bepronounced and affix meanings to them. The students could then use the 42 words, realizing that they have created a language which only their com-munity has agreed upon)3.The same exercise can be applied to one word. All the following words mean \"dog\" in the classroom wall is a good instrument to illustrateto students the need for agreement. Ask students whether we couldkeep time by dividing the clay into twelve rather than twenty-fourhours. How many seconds would there be in a minute? How manyminutes in an hour ? Hours in a day? Days in a week? Havestudents figure their own system of days, weeks, and months. They should discover that the only ingredient necessary to make theirnew time system work is agreement by its users.Human language has the ability to transcend the limitations of time anctspace. Man can describe the past and forecast the future. He can speak of different places and of actions far removed in both time and place. Mancan talk about anything.Suggested Classroom Activities1.Sentences writter on the board whic:i indicate variety of time (tense)will illustrate to students their ability to leap the barrier of time.a.Insects carry germs.b.The Indian squaw carried her baby on her back.c.The spaceship will early three astronauts.The teacher could, at this point, introduce the concept of tense. Askstudents to compare and compose sentences indicating present, past, andfuti re tenses.2.To illustrate the ability of language to transcend both time andspace, the teacher could supply the students with a list of wordsand ask them to use them in sentences. The sentences shoulddeal with past, present, and future time and offer a variety ofplaces.camelColumbusdinosaurleopardRobin HoodmatadorcaravanPresident NixoncaliphjungleCarl YastrzemskiZeusmoonshipApollo 11Vietnam 4353: Human language has an incredible variety of phonetic resources.

No human language uses all the soundsthat man can make.English uses only about forty speech sounds (phonemes)and has created over one half million words from them. Some languagesuse as few as thirteen speech sounds, others as many as sixty. Thousands of speech sounds are possible. Each language has its own system of speechsounds.Suggested Classroom Activities1.A comparison of words from several languages will illustrateto students the variety of vocal sot'nds man can make.

Languages, expecially English, borrow freely fromone another.Using dictionaries, have students determine the languagefrom which each the following words As a spiritual and mystic creature, manis a maker of symbols. He is always looking for deeper meanings. Throughthe ages man has found symbols in nature and has created symbols to avertcatastrophe and to appease the gods. Tribal dances, religious rites, chants, monuments, flags, and tombstones are all man's symbolic creations. Of all forms of symbolism, language is the most highly developed and complicated.Human beings, by agreement, can make anything stand for anything. Moreoverthere need not be any connection between the symbol and that which issymbolized. Words are Arbitrary Symbols.Suggested Classroom ActivitiesI.Lead students to discover and understand the concept of asymbol and its referent. A symbol is anything used to stand for orrepresent anything else.Its referent is the object or idea for which itstands. Use common symbols to lead students to a definition.dovehawkfour-leaf cloverskull and crossbonesflaggoldowl 46peacewargood luckpoisoncountrywealthwisdom Students may supply more than one referent for each symbol. Forexample, a dove could be a religious symbol, and a skull and cross-bonescould signify piracy.It should be stressed, at this point, that agreementon the referent is necessary for understanding among the users.1.Ask students to make a list of other common symbols andtheir referents.2.Have students collect visual symbols such as those usedin advertising and political cartoons.3.Discuss and make a list of symbols found in reading.This particularly applies to students' reading inmythology.4.Discuss current prestige symbols. (clothing, cars, homes,jewelry, etc.5.Discuss and find examples of symbols used in variouscultures.(Indian headdresE, cowboy hat, native masks, etc.)2.Just as an object or picture may be a symbol, words are symbols.When two or more speakers agree upon a sound or word to re-present something in the real world, they have agreed upon asound or word symbol. The most important concept to beunderstood is that the word is not the thing symbolized. For example, a \"dog\" could have just as easily been mlied a \"cat\".The \"sun\" could have been called \"moon\".Since neither \"dog\" nor \"sun\" are the objects, but merely thesymbols agreed upon to represent them, the symbol could bechanged if everyone agreed upon it. The sun and dog would exist whether a word symbol existed for them or not.Students should understand that there is little or no relationshipbetween the symbol and that which is symbolized. Words are arbitrarysymbols. The same object is symbolized differently by different peoples.Thus, we could call a horse a pferd as Germans do, a caballo as Spaniards do,an alogo as Greeks do, a ioshat as Russians do, or a mail as the Chinese do.The same arbitrary quality appears in one language. A frappe invarious parts of the United States is labelled a \"frosted\", \"milk shake\",\"malted\", and even a \"cabinet\". 47 ,) THE STUDY OF LANGUAGE OBJECTIVES:The student wi'1 understand the term \"renaissance'',The student will learn that great numbers of Greek and Latin wordsand roots filled the English language as a result of the Renaissance.The student will be able to explain the phrases \"coin a phrase\" and\"coin a word\".The student will understand what a language family is.Teacher Background:One of language's more encompassing hybrid words is \"renaissance\",formed from the French prefix re, meaning \"again ', and the Latin rootraso, meaning \"to be born\". \"Renaissance\" literally means rebirth orrevival.Western culture gives the word a capital \"R\" and uses it to mean thegreat revival of art, literature, and learning which occurred in Europe in the 14th,15th, and 16th centuries.The culture of ancient Greece and Rome, at leastthat part which had survived barbarians, overly-righteous Christians,and natural disasters, had lain dormant for almost a thousand years.Slowly, this great body of learning was rediscovered and re-evaluated.It was the foundatim for the sudden flurry astonishing achievement in all fields of human evdeavor which launched Vostern Man into themodern era.If one place is to be pinpointed as the cradle of the Renaissance, itmust be the Italian city of Florence. Though no one person can ever becredited with a movement of such scope as the Renaissance, The Medicifamily, bankers whoeventually became rulers of Florence, must besingled out for recognition as tha guiding lights of the movement's spirit.Though not great artists themselves, they patronized the struggling greatsof their day, gave thm commissions, and were indirectly responsible formany of the works of Michelangelo, Donatello, Verrochlo, andinnumerable other writers, painters, sculptors, and scholars. It is alleged that Lorenzo the Magnificent, the greatest of the Medici, authoredone of the first Italian grammars himself, as well as running the city,patronizihg the greats, and playing power polities.It is impossible to date the Renaissance, for like all great culturalmovements, it had preceding and following periods of transition. Also, in an age Af limited communication, word of new ideas travelled slowly,explaining why Italy was out of the Renaissance, ai.d into the Elaroctueperiod while England was just reaching its heights of Renaissance accomplish-ments. S48 Perhaps the best transitional figure linking the late medieval worldwith the world of the early Renaissance is the Florentine writer DanteAlighieri.Dante's Divine Comedy exhibited the following characteristicswhich are the forerunners of the spirit of the Renaissance:1.Increased interest in people rather than total emphasis uponGod, the angels, saints, and demons.2.Increased interest in and use of styles, ideas, and devicesfrom the classical past.Virgil, for instance, is acharacter in the Divine Comedy , which itself is stylisticallyan imitation of Th-e-3.The use of the vernacular as an acceptable, indeedpreferable, writing language, rather than the classicalLatin used almost exclusively in the Middle Ages.Dante has medieval zharacteristics also. Predominant is the fact that, although his interest lies in people, his people still inhabit the worldof life after death through which he is first guided by Virgil, then by hisbeloved Beatrice.It took humanists of a later date to define the centralfeature of the Renaissance, namely, interest in man as he lives in and isaffected by the material world.The Renaissance is usually divided into two parts: The Early Renaissanceand the High Renaissance, with the advent of Leonardo da Vinci as thedividing line.Included in the period of the Early Renaissance are thewriters Petrarch and Boccaccio (both of whom were greatly admired the painters Giotto, Cambue, Fra Lippo Lipp!, Fra Angelico,Botticelli, and a host of other painters, sculptors, architects, anddesigners. The High Renaissance is the era of da Vinci, Michelangelo,Bramante, Machiavelli, the Burgias, the Sterzas, the d'Estes, Lorenzothe Magnificent, to mention some of the myriad greats. In the High Renaissance, the vernacular was established as the language of literature;humanism became the accepted philosophy of the educated; non-religiousschools were established; perspective was perfected as a technique inpainting; the Americas were discovered and explored; contacts with Asia andAfrica were expanded; linguistic studies of the various national tongues wereassembled; scientific exploration was begun; superstitions were questioned;and the world view which marks modern man was set.During the Renaissance the English language underwent explosivereowth in vocabulary.English scholars developed a passion fcr theclassics of Greece and Rome and mattered Greek and Latin so theycould read ancient literature in the oriOnal tongues. As mastery of theselanguages increased, v.ords from them began to flood into English and tobe used as English vocabulary by ordinary men and women who had noknowledge of Greek and Latin. Scientific and medical language was expanded by the addition GI \"genius\", 'pollen\", \"area\", more. Shakespeare'splays contain many words which appeared in print as English fur the first49 5.9 time, for he, like other writers of his day, borrowed freely. Shakespearean firsts include: \"accommodation\", \"dislocate\", \"frugal\", ' indistinguishable\", \"misanthrope\", and \"obscene \", to mention only a few.At this time hybrid words flourished also. The most usualcombination was Greek or Latin prefixes and suffixes combined withAnglo-Saxon, Scandinavian, or French roots, This process gave us \"scientist\", \"jurist\", \"demoralize \", \"slenderize \", \"anti-vivisectionist\",\"pro-suffrage\", \"ex-king\", and many others. This process is what led eventually to that triumph of English linguistics, \"antidisestablishment-arianism\".During the Renaissance at least 10,000 new words entered theEnglish lexicon. These were mainly of Latin and Greek origin, but alsoincluded borrowings from Spanish, Italian, and Dutch. Most are stillin use today, although some were invented, played with, and then droppedas too awkwarf' it unnecessary. Words like \"adnichilate\" (to be reduced tonothing), \"obtestute\" (to call upon), and \"invigilate\" (to be watchful) r .me and went quickly.This process of inventing ,a word to cover some meaning one wishesneatly summed up is called \"coining a word\". When one coins a word, one invents it or \"steals\" it from another language, and then uses it for thefirst time in one's own language. The same process takes place withgroups of words. Coining phrases has been one of the indirect contribu-tions of writers and speakers for centuries. Shakespeare was the firstto say, \"backing a horse \"sweetsto the sweet\", \"a rose by any other name is still a rose\", and many more expressions in common use today.Perhaps the main reason English is able toborrow from, and makecompounds of words from Latin, Greek, French, Italian, Dutch, German , and Spanish is that these languages are all members of the same languagefamily, the Indo-European family of languages.A language family consists of all the languages that have been formedfrom one ancient parent language. Language families have various branches, and each branch has its own set of languages. For example, one branch ofIndo-European is Italic. From Italic was developed Latin. Latin itself gave birth to the Romance languages: Italian, Portuguese, Spanish,French, Rumanian, and Provencal. The Indo-European parent languagehas eight separate branches containing 192 different languagea, somedead, many living.Other language families of interest to Americans are:1.Japanese - Korean family which contains only the twolanguages of its name. 5060 2.African Negro family which contains three branches:a.Hottentot-Bushmanb.Sudanese-Guineanc.Bantu-One member language of the Bantu familyis Swahili, in which there has been increa...edinterest recently on the part of some blackAmericans.3.Ural (Uralic) -Altaic family which contains:a.Finnishb.Hungarianc.Turkishd.,L Mongole.Manchu4.Semitic family which contains:a.Arabicb.Hebrewc.Amharic - one of the Ethiopian languages5.Sino-Tibetan family which contains the world's mostspoken language, Chinese. Others in the family include:a.Burmeseb.Tibetanc.Thaid.Laoe.Vietnamese PREFIXES AND SUFFIXES1OBJECTIV.38:The student will learn common Greek and Latin prefixes and suffixes.The student will learn how to use the dictionary to find word derivations. 1 5181I Background:Seventh grade students should become aware of the rich heritageof Greek and Latin words within the English language. A study of Greekand Latin prefixes and suffixes offers an opportunity for students todiscover and explore the influence of Greek and Latin on English.Students should not be required to memorize lists e Creek and Latinprefixes and suffixes.This unit is intended to be .-tiiEFON arT-JZ--act en eperiod of time.It might be taught in weekly lessons, or integrated withthe unit called the Study of Language.Suggested Classroom Activities1.Students are more likely to retain the meanings of prefixes andsuffixes if they examine groups of words with the same prefixor the same suffix.For example, the teacher may write thefollowing group of words on the board:exitexhaleexpand ex1,e1exileexcludeStudents should study the words to determine what they have incommon. With little difficulty, they should be able to determine thatthe prefix \"ex\" means \"out of'. Have students affix meanings to thewords and add to the list.2.Students may supply words whose definitions are not quite clear.In the following list, the prefix \"ex\" has the same meaning, butit is less obvious.exaggerateexcerptexampleexhaustexcavateexecute (to carry out)excelexerciseexceptexpenseSuch words offer an opportunity for dictionary work. The studentsshould be able to determine the derivation and original meaning of thewords. They should be able to answer the following questions:For example:exhaust (L. exhaustus, pp. ex-, out + haurirej to draw)a.Where in a dictionary entry do you find thederivation of a word? 52 62 b.What does L.

Suggested Classroom ActivitiesTo arouse pupils' curiosity, cards with words on them which will haveenough variety to show the changing nature of language should be placedaround the room. Suggested words are:coal-hod, medicare, seabee, forsooth, smog, laundromat,scuba, jeep, dyne!, astronaut, aureomycin,These words may be more easily written on the board,Establish what the students already know about the dictionary. Whatis it ? When does one use a dictionary? Does it tell anything more than a word's meaning? Of what value is the syllabication of words ? Does thedictionary help one learn to spell a word, or does it require some knowledge of spelling? The teacher might ask pupils to lock up \"phlegm\" or \"gnarled\" thertby showing that some spelling knowledge is essential 54 64 even before a dictionary is consulted. Students then should look up such items as \"Yellow River\", \"Montezuma\", \"Salerno\", \"Marie Antoinette\"and \"Antigone\". Using will allow students todiscover the dictionary's extra value.Each student should have access to a good dictionary, preferably acollege edition.All too often, the \"junior\", \"student\", or \"high school\"editions are so simplified that they lack much useful information,particularly information of an etymological nature.From the school library, the local library, or his own resources, the teachershould have on hand several dictionaries, different from the classroom set; an un-abridged one (Webster's new Third International is excellent), various paperbackdictionaries, and those specializing in certain areas such as music, art, sports, andmythology.Students should explore these and discover their purposes and differences.Students must also realize the importance of publication dates asthey affect a dictionary's entrfr o. They will discover as they begin to look up the words hunt, around the room or written on the board thatsome words to not appear in older dictionaries. Some will not be inpaperbacks. The changing nature of language must De emphasized.A subsequent series of lessons involving encyclopedias and variousrecord books (students enjoy browsing through Guinness's Book of WorldRecords, a new edition of which appears annually iTa natural developmentof this dictionary work.Student Enrichment ActivitiesI.Student reports on dictionary making2.Student reports on the history of dictionaries3.Biographical studies of Dr. Samuel Johnson and Noah Webster4.A slang dictionary, to be circulatA,d throughout the school,created as a group projectNote: There are excellent audio-visual materials which the teacher mayuse in presenting both the dictionary and the encyclopedia to These 55 GRADE VII DENOTATION AND CONNOTATION OBJECTIVES:The student will know the difference between denotative andconnotative meanings of words.The student will realize that words have several levels ofmeaning.le student will learn that words carry associative meaninoften have little relation to their dictionary meanings. that Background:In Through the Looking Glass, Lewis Carroll recorded thefollowing conversation between Alice and Humpty Dumpty:\"When I use a word... it means Just what 1 choose it to mean-neither morn or less.\"\"The question is\", said Alice, \"whether you many things.\"\"The question Humpty Dumpty, \"which is to be themaster-that's all.\"The general purpose of this unit is to make students masters of thewords they use, see, and hear. Do words mean what we want them tomean? Can we \"make words mean so many different things\" ?A study of the denotative and connotative meanings of words willhelp students become, if not masters over words, at least aware of levelsof meaning that words carry and the power of words.Part IDenotationBackground:Denotative meanings of words are generally the dictionary meanings ofwords. The notion that every word has a \"correct meaning' should beclarified. One word can have several denotative meanings. The meanings 66 66'1 of words are constantly shifting and changing, and the dictionary writeris constantly revising in order to keep up with this change. No onedictionary can contain all the words and meanings in Engigh because ourlanguage is ever growing, ever changing. The dictionary attempts toexplain, as carefully as possible, the common core of meanings assignedto a word. These core meanings -are the word's denotations. (For seventh grade students the term \"dictionary\" meaning may be substitutedfor \"denotative\" meaning.)Suggested Classroom Activities1.In order to illustrate to students the levels of meaning associatedwith one word, ask them to define a simple word like \"table\".Students may ask, \"What kind of table 7\" Right away they areattaching levels of meaning to the word. All the definitionsoffered by the class should be put on the board, and thenstudents should check their definitions using a dictionary.Webster's New World Dictionary of the American Languagecites the following definitions for the word \"table\":1.a thin slab of metai, stone or wood used for inscriptions;tablet2.a piece of furniture consisting of a flat top sethorizontally on legs3.such a table set with food for a meal4.food nerved at table5.the people seated at the table6.a compact, systematic list of details, contents, etc.7.a compact, orderly arrangement of facts, figures, etc. ,usually In rows and columns: as, the multiplication table8.a tableland9.any flat, horizontal surface, piece or layerAfter completing this process with more words, the studenta shouldbe able to determine what a dictionary or denotative meaning is. They should realize that very often one \"correct\" meaning is insufficient andthat words have levels of meaning.2.The same objectives can be reached in a similar exercise.Again, the teacher chooses a simple word and presents it tothe class in a group of senZerces. The word should be, one 57 67,. with several levels of meaning. For example:1.The student strAted across the room with an air oftriumph.2.After the compliment, she felt she was walking cnair.3,He gave her the air.4.Want some air in your tires, mister ?5.She certainly does put on airs!6.The summer air was warm and fragrant with thesce:it of flowers.7.There was a suspicious air about the two men.8.In 1860 v change was in the air.9.The students were allowed to air their views to thestudent council.10.Will the ballpme be or the air tonight ?.a.Have students determine the various denotations ofthe word \"air\" as it is used in the sentences. Thisprocess, it might be pointed out to the students, isvery similar to the process that the writers ofdictionaries use to determine the meanings ofwords. ,\" yb.Have students formulate as many sentences aspossible that illustrate the denotations of thefollowing words:tabledatehorseric hwalkflightslftledogarmwater 58 IConnotative language is language which affects us rather than informsus. This affectivequality of words is relayedthrough tone of voice, rhythm,alliteration, or through the pleasant or unpleasant feelings which surroundthe word. Word connotations can be gained through personal experience, orlearned from one's family orsociety. For example, most students wouldbe unable to give the denotative meaning of the word \"communism\", yetwould react unfavorably to the connotative meaning of the word. Sincemost students have neverknown a communist or studied communism,their reaction would be trulyemotional. The power of words, therefore,lies not in their denotative meaning but also in their associatedmeanings;the emotions they evoke, theimages they stir up in the mind, and the sensoryreaction they produce.S'iggested Classroom Activities1.The use of the following poem by John E. Donovan, which appearedin The Saturday EveningPost, provides an effective way tointroduce the concept of connotative meanings to the students.\"Semantics\"Call a woman a kitten, but never a cat;You can call her a mouse, cannot call her a rat;Call a woman a chicken. but never a hen;Or you surely will not be hercaller again.You can call her a duck, cannot call her a goose;You can call her a deer, but never a moose;You can call her a lamb, but never a sheep;Economic she lives , but you can't call her cheap.You can say she's a vision, can't say she's a sight;And no woman is skinny, she's slender and slight;If she should burn you up, say she sets you afire;And you'll always be welcome, you tricky old liar.a.Before presenting the poem to students, have themdetermine the denotative slightchickenlamb\"burn up\"hensheep\"set afire\" On reading students react to the connotative meaning of thewords, not their denotative meanings. They are aware that words like catkitten, mouse and rat, mean totally different things in the poem than they 59 tql do in the dictionary. To Illustrate this to students, the teacher may writeseveral of the words from the poem on the board and ask students for boththe dictionary definition of each word and its connotative meaning in thepoem. (Again, with seventh grade students the term \"associated\" meaningsmay prove easier to work with than \"connotative\")Related Activities1.Have students make up lists of other animal names oftenapplied to humans. They should distinguish between thedenotative and associated meanings of the words.wolfbuzzarddogwormvultureswinesnakemuleowldorkeycrowshrewfoxsharkweaselgorilla2.Have students list and explain common phrases which incorporatehuman-animal comparisons or human-object comparisons:\"gentle as a lamb\"\"a bull in a china shop\"\"clever a fox\"\"a dog's life\"\"timid as a as brass\"\"solid a rock\"3.Develop 113ts of ate how personal connotative meanings can be,write a word on the board and have students write quicklyany associations that come into their heads.

GRAMMAR: THE SENTENCE AND ITS PARTSI.ReviewA.The basic patterns or kernel sentences and the simplenegative, interrogative, and passive transformationsb.The functions of the modifiers-adjectives andadverbs - as preparation for phrase and clause work II.Introduce Embedding of Phrases and Clauses OBJECTIVES:The student will understand the function of the prepositionalphrase in the sentence.The student will be able to identify the subordinate and mainclauses and understand the function of each in the sentence. Background:\"Embedding\", a transformation in which one kernel or basic patternis made a part of another kernel, is a term used in transformationalgramniar; however, it is a process which occurs in the language andcan be studied in any grammatical approach. Basic Pattern No. I The house is old.Basic Pattern No. 2 The house is on the corner.Embedding transformations:a.Prepositional phrase The house on the corner is old.b.Relative clauses. The house which is on thecorner is old.Students should realize that phrases and clauses can be stated in basic 62 \"i2t 1Jpatterns or kernels and then combined or embedded in another sentenceaccording to its function.Practice in embedding sentences should make thestudents realize the variety of choices offered by the English language.The teacher should try to avoid an approach which demands onlymechanical identification of the sentence parts and strive to prov:de thestudents with an understanding of the relationships which exist within thesentence.The following is an outline of the sentence parts required to bearalyzed in this gradc.A.The prepositional in number OS definite pronounOne of the boys (is, are ) going.Several of the boys (is , are 1 going.B.The compound subjectThe boys and I (is, are) going.Either the boys or Joe (is, are) going.Either Joe or the boys (is, are) going.C.The relative pronounThe girls who (is, are) absent will make up thetest tomorrow.Anyone who (is, are) present today will receiveextra credit. LOGIC AND THE MASS MEDIABackground:In grade six the students analyzed commercials in two media:radio and television. They determined whether the message was fact oropinion, and what part the audience played in determining the methodof selling.Students in grade seven should build upon the foundation setin grade six n.rld learn more about vary common fallacies in logic andthen apply this knowledge to a study of commercials or advertisements notonly in radio and television, but also in the magazines.Note: The teacher should avoid the pedantic lab&3 attached to thevarious fallacies; the student should discover errors inreasoning processes and not memorize terms.I.LogicA.The hasty generalization OBJECTIVES: LThe student will learn the difference between a particular and auniversal t.tatement.The student will discover that the hasty generalization is fallaciousreasoning. 6474.1 Suggested Classroom Activities1.Students should first learn the key words which distinguish theparticular statement from the universal or general. A verysimple illustration should be the most effective. What is thedifference between these two statements: 1.Some of the dogs are spotted.2.All of the dogs are spotted.Students should realize immediately that the first statement speaksonly of a partial number of the dogs while the second statement refers toall the dogs. The words \"some\" and \"all\", therefore, determine that onestatement is particular and the other is universal or general.More exercises or examples should be provided until the teachercan be reasonably certain that the students have grasper; the concept.2.After the students have achieved the first objective, they shouldthen study the logical basis of univernal or genera'. statements.They should realize that a general. or universal statement can bereiuted if one exception can be found, . 9. , all dogs are notspotted if one can be found that is a solid color.The teacher should provide more activities so that the students mayexmice hasty generalizations. The degree of difficulty or sophisticationwill depend upon the classroom activities.B.The limited choice OBJECTIVES:The student will dise:Jvar that many statements which offer onlytwo choices or alternatives are frequently misleading or fallacious. Suggested Classroom Activities1.The teacher should proceed as inductively as pc, Bible.Provide some samples ce. the limited choice fallacy and havethe student attempt to discover what is missing from thestatements.Samples:a.You are either with us or against us. 1357 ty b.Love America or leave it.c.Either we go to war or we lose everything.d.You are either a Republican or a Democrat.2.Work with the magazine to discover how many advertisementsare based on this \"either-or\" fallacy. How many ads imply only two alternatives ? Hrnv many are based on generalizations ? 1, GRADE VIIILANGUAGE 67 THE STUDY OF LANGUAGE OBJECTIVE:The student will explore the Old English, Middle English, and Modern Englishperiods.The student will learn how certain changes in the English language were prompt-ed by historical events.The student will know the contributions to the language of:1.Augustine2.Alfred the Great3.Geoffrey Chaucer4.William Caxton5.William Shakespeare6.Samuel Johnson7.Noah Webster Teacher Background:The development of the English language is divided into three periods: OldEnglish, Middle English, and Modern English. The Modern English period separates into Early Modern and Later Modern. Placing dates on these periods is quitearbitrary and Ignores that Important idea of transition between movements in cul-ture.Scholars disagree even on the arbitrary dates. More often than not, however,Old English is dated 450-1100 A.D. ; Middle English is dated 1100-1500 A.D. ; EarlyModern dates from 1600-1700 A. D. and Liter Modern dates from 1700 A. D. to thepresent: The dates for the beginning and end of the Middle English period are themost disputed..;j$4,.,,---.Old English, or Anglo-Saxon, is the most Germanic language of the three. It has all the features of the Ficisian, Dutch, and German languages of the same era. Its basic features are: *.-;-,!! ,1.Every tette*. stands for a sound; there are no silent letters. There s, are no spelling standArds, but this creates few problems, as OldEnglish is quite phonetic. )-..2.Verbs, nouns, pronouns, and adjectives have inflected endings.Verbs have six different forms in both the present and past. Ad-jectives have various endings depending on what they ?re modifyingNouns and pronouns have four cases. 60 words (nouns, pronouns, verbs, and modifiers) ::avechanges subject to tense, person, number, gender, and mocU.4.The syntax is synthetic, or merely dependent upon the writer. Asmost words show their functions through their endings, word place-ment is relatively unimportant.5.Punctuation and capitalization rules are different and fewer.6.Vowel sounds are pronounced as they are in tv ertieth centuryEuropean languages other than English.Borrowing is not common. Old English prefers lo coin new wordswhen new ideas need names. Some Celtic play e-name holdovers areused: Londcn, Dover, Thames, Avon, etc. Latin gives religious terms, but only a few non-religious terms fitter )n, such as \"spend\",\"rook\", and \"radish\". Many words are taken from the always the stressed syllable.9.The alphabet has no j, g, v, or z. Two different signs, howevet, are are used to represent \"th\".10.No paragraphing is used in writing.11.Dcmble consonants have extended pronunciation.12.\"Schwa\" vowel (\"e\" on the word \"name\") has stressed pronunciationMiddle En: lultith is the result of two languages living side by aide for centuries,before one,tins Abandoned. For almost three hundred years after theNorman Invasion in 1086, French via& the language of culture, government, and law.It was spoken exclusively by the upper classes who looked upon Anglo-Saxon as low,vulgar, and graceless. Those Anglo-Saxons who wished to ingratiate themselvesinto Norman favor, or who wished to pass themselves off as \"better than the rest\",learned French.Slowly, however, the Normans lost their French holdings, inter-married with Anglo-Saxons, and became more conscious of being English. Ashostilities reiaxed, more and more French borrowings slipped into English. When the Hundred Years War broke out in 1337, the Normans were passionately English. Whenit was used, French was totally differeht (tom the French of Paris, and Middle Eng-lish had fully developed the following characteristics:1.Borrowing from other languages became habitual.2.;Many words were stressed on syllables other than the first.t 70 3.Most case endings were gone from nouns. The \"s\" in the possessivewas a major exception.4.Analytic syntax was developed. A word's function was the result ofits place LI a sentence, ratifier than its inflected ending.5.The \"ed\" on verb consonants drawn out pronunciations.'I.The schwa vowel was still pronounced.-8.No standards existed for spelling, which because of French influence,became more complex. The Old English word \"queen\" for example,was spelled \"queen\", \"queene\", \"even\", \"kweine\", and dialect of London and its surrounding Midlands wasstandard Middle English, mainly as a result of the writings orGeoffrey Chaucer.10.The end of the period saw the start of the Great Vowel Shift, whichadded immeasurably to the spelling and pronunciation difficulties inthe English language.For some unknown reason, the vowel symbolsbegan to represent sounds different from those that the vowel signsrepresented in other European languages. Long vowels became diphthnn0, and short vowels became long. This peculiar linguisticevent explains why a Spaniard would pronounce \"this big ship\" as\"Vices beeg sheep\".Vowels did not shift in his or other Europeanlanguages.His letter \"i\" has an \"e\" sound, as in the Spanish si,meaning yes.11.Though it locks more like modern English, Middle English soundsmore like Old English.'Early Modern English, the langlage of the Elizal:ethan Era, England's GoldenAge, re easily recognisable to the twentieth century reader,of English, although how much one would understand hearing it spoken is a matter of e holarly dispute. Some of the features of Early Modern English are:1.Analytic syntax was firmly established and followed basically thesame system as t wnntleth century syntax.2.Usage was often elfferent from twentieth century usage. One cca-mon difference was the frequent use of double, triply, and evenquadruple negatives, umially for emphasis as in these examplesfrom Shakespeare: \"Thou iast spoken no word all this while, norunderstood none neither. \"; and \"Nor never none shall mistressbe of it save I alone.\" Another difference in sage was in the 71 comparative and superlative forms of adjectives. Expressions Like \"more larger\" and \"most unkindest\" ill istrate the use of thedouble comparative and superlative.3.Latin and Greek words became English words in greater numbersthan before or since.Spanish, Dutch, and Italian words were alsoborrowed in great numbers.4.There was still much variety in spelling. For instance, an author's spelling of th\u00ae same word two or three different ways inthe same work was not uncommon. 5.\"s\" and \"es\" began to replace \"est\" and \"th\" on verbs.6.Writers began to view the language as plastic and developed thehabit of using one part of speech as another. This habit becomes quite typical of Later Modern English. Examples from Shakespeareonce again are: \"Write this down and history it for all ages. \";\"Strangered with an oath. \"; \"Wouldst thou be windowed backward and abysm of time.\"7.Compoundings increased amazingly.8.The language reached heights of magnificence which have never beensurpassed and rarely equaled. As Richard Mulcaster, an Elizabethaneducator, so perceptively observed, \"1 take this present period ofour English tongue to be the very height thereof.\"Later Modern En lish, the English of today, though more like than unlike Early!Iodern English, stiferentiating characteristics which include:1.Much needed standardized spelling was attained through the im-pressive dictionary accomplishments of Dr. Johnson and NoahWebster.2.Eighteenth century linguists began to apply rules of Latin grammarto English, thereby cutting off much of the plasticity exhibitedearlier.They forbade double negatives, prepositions at the ends objective case pronouns verbs, etc. .3.\"Americanisms\" became respectaLle; later the term AmericanEnglish became recognized as English in America subject to manydifferent influences expanding and changing more rapidly thantraditional Britieb \"thee\", accompanied \"thou\"; \"thougoest\" became \"you go\". 72 5.Borrowings became wore international, coming from India, theAmerican Indian Tribes, and the masses of immigrants who enter-ed the United States.6.The process of coining words and phrases becomes more freqnentthrough the influence of science, medicine, journalism, pioneering,ranching, politics, and the mass media.7.English becomes more borrowed from than borrowing, indicatingits importance amJng the world's languages.Certain historical events are intimately associated with the various periodsof the English language. The Old English period is the result of thi: Anglo-SaxonInvasion.Three Gerranic tribes entered Celtic England r.nd in a century had itunder their control.The .lutes entered Kent in 449 A.D.; the Saxons arrived insouthern England in 477 A. D. and the Angles, after whom England is named,entered eastern England in 547 A.D. These three tribal invasions planted Ger-manic language in England. The coming of Christianity around 590 A. D. pre-sented the Anglo-Saxons with the Roman alphabet which they quickly adopted.Although Viking raids had been occurring for a century, it was not until 866 A. D. that the Vikings, called the Danes, invaded England with the intentionsof staying.The valiant efforts of Alfred the Great kept the Danes from over-whelming the country, but the Danes did stay, occupying one-third of England,which they called the Danelaw, and giving to Old English its only set of wordborrowings which were stillGermanic in origin.1066 is one of those rare red-letter years in a nation's history. Duke William of Normandy, later King William I of England, also called William theConquerer, claimed the English tiuon6 Anglo-Saxon nobles had elected a Saxon lord, Harold, as king that year, when Edward the Confessor died without an heir.William claimed that he was Edward's choice for England's king, and invaded.Harold and his men, after defeating the Danes who were troublesome once agate,rushed to Hastings, where the Normans, several elf..Isaac's strong, had encamped.In the battle Harold was killed, and England became a Norman possession. Frenchwas introduced as the official language. In the following centuries English changedtremendously in both structure and vocabulary.The Italian Renaissance was the next historical era which proferndly influencedthe English language.This movement was treated at some length in the GradeSeven Background.It was the period in which new Greek and Latin words, theintroduction of the printing press, and the delight in new words prompted bydiscovery and exploration, combined to lift English into the Early Modern period.he gradual ascendency of the United States to a position far more weightyth4.3 that of Great Britain, and the age of the mass media are the final historicalphases to influence the English language. The first explains the more casual useof the language, which in the opinion of scholars, is much more like theElizabethan approach than that of modern Britain. The second explains the 73 8? \"fad\" quality of so many words and phrases, and also the Americanization of otherlangi.wges, influenced by American films and television.Several men take positions of primacy in the history of the English languagebecause of their contributions ant innovations.St. Augustine, not the neo-Platonist, North African philosopher, but '..heRoman missionary sent to England by Pope Gregory in 5c,9 A. D. , is credited with introducing the Roman alphabet into Anglo-Saxon England. He was not the first Christian in England. A few years before his arrival Irish monks had begun thework of conversion in northern England. Legend has it that Pope Gregory, seeing Angle boys being sold as slaves in Rolle, said they were angels, not Angles, anddetermined to get to England to convert them. Instead he was elected Pope and sentAugustine.Augustine's !list converts were Jutes and Saxons. The Irish mis-sionaries were already amor- the Angles. During Roman occupation, there were many Christians in Engiam i, Indeed, the church 6. Canterbury used by Augustine was not built by Him, but was a Christian chapel erected by RomanizedCelts many years before. Auguqine's contribution to the language, then, is theintroduction of +he Roman alphabet and the first, thovgh few, Latin words to beaccepted in English.The only English monarch to be Piv en the title \"the Great\", was the monumentalKing Alfred, a Saxon who united the Anglo Saxon_\"3 in their struggle against the Danes.Ms contributions to the English language are as vital as his service to his country:1.Alfred began the famed \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\" Ithieh continuedin existence until 1154.2.He established the West Saxon dialect as the literary language ofEngland.3.He rebuilt estroyed schools and established many new ones.4.He taught himself Latin and then personally translated many Latinworks into Old Z.nglish.Geoffrey Chaucer was to Middle English what Alfred was to Old English:1.He made writing in the vernacular not only acceptable, but fashion-able.2.His Canterbury Tales is the greatest single work of the MiddleEnglish period.9.Through him many of the styles and ideas of the early Renais-sance entered Enghuici.4.He established the London dialect as the preferred dialect ofEnglish. 74 In 1440 a German aristocrat, Johannes Gutenberg, invented a printing presswith movable type.An Englishman, William Caxton, brought the printing pressto England and in 1476 began printing books. The import of Caxton's work is im-measurable. Tha wowing middle class who desired learning but could not affordhand-crafted manuscripts were able to purchase printed books at relatively cheapprices.Caxton also put into print many great works which received tremendouscirculation. Among them were Malory's Le Mort D'Arthur and Chaucer's Canterbtu yTales. Caxton also printed the Bible.The giant in the English language is, without doubt, William Shakespeare. It was he wore than anyone else who recognized the plastic quality of the Englishlanguage. Many English words appear for the first time in his works, and hiswriting vocabulary was a stunning 20,000 words, more than any other writer in anyage.He corned more phrases that have become part of the language's mode ofexpression than any other author. With a mastery of expression t'dat was both a model for and a reflection of the Elizabethan delight in language, Shakespearebrought the English language to its full flowering and richness.In 1755, Dr. Samuel Johnson published his 40,000 entry Dictionary of theEnglish Language.Johnson believed that it was the duty of the lexicograpffeiT. oshow how Language is used, to attempt to establish standards of usage to easecommunt,:ation. Johnson believed that enelling shoulc: be standardized and simpli-fied wher.ever possible.It is now fashionable to point to the unsophisticated, per-haps primitive, dictionary style employed by Johnson. His syllabication was over- simplified, breaking only on the accanteu syllable. He had no phonetic spellings, no etymologies, and no sets of synonyms or antonyms. However, the magnitude of his concept in a field that was little worked in is impressive. Previous dictionaries had comparatively few entries and frequently specialized. In the early seventeenth century, for instance, Henry Cockeram published The English Diction-ew an Interpreter of Hard English .cords designed to give explanations ofnew English words from Latin and Greek. U. Johnson's valiant attempts tostandardize spellings, give examples of good usage, and encompass the full scopeof the English language for the first time has left a lasting mark on the language.Undoubtedly, the greatest American linguist was Noah Webster, a toweringfigure in America's version of the English language. It was he who insisted that Arericans use the English language as it suited them, not as English scholars orAmerican Anglophiles dictated. He declared that \"Americanisms\" had a distinct, necessary, and valuable place in the language. His doing so did much to give earlyAmericans confidence in themselves and it the culture which they had evolved and towhich they were adding each year. The international recognition accorded Bryant,Emerson, Thoreau, and Poe during Webster's lifetime more than proved his point.Super patriot, devout scholar, indefatigable traveler, Revolutionary Waveteran, prolific writer, American humanist, Webster is all these, as well as beingthe greatest single figure in the compiling of English language dictionaries. His two editions of An American Dictionary of the En lish Lan a ,, the first in 1828,the second in 11117 two years before his derma h at age , esfished the basic principles for all succeeding dictionaries: 75 84 1.Inclusion of scientific, medical and technical terms2.Arrangement of meanings in numerical order, the etymologicallyprimary definition coming first3.Inclusion of coirloxte etymological information, which is a goldmineof knowledge for the interested linguist4.Inclusion of words used by speakers of English regardless of theircondemnation by grammarians in EnglandAlso influenttal was Webster's The American Spelling Book, which sold betweeneighty and one hundred million copies during the nineteenth century. The inconsistencyof English spelling annoyed Webster as much as it was to annoy the great GeorgeBerard Shaw.Webster's book, also called the Blue Backed Speller, attempted tosimplify spelling with at least some recognition of phonetics. Seventeenth and eighteenth century grammarians, entranced with Latin and the artificial applicationsto English of Latin rules, had put a \"b\" into \"debt\", a \"gh\" into \"delight\", wordsthat in In Webster's speller,\"publick\" and \"hed\" and \"head\" and dozensmore simplifications. Some were accepted; others were rejected, to the everlastinggrimaces of schoolchildren who have suffered through the inconsistent, oftengrotesque, patterns of English spelling since.G. B. Shaw invented the word \"ghoti\", which, said he, was pronounced \"fish\"since \"gh\" is \"f\" in words like \"cough\" is \"I\" in \"women\" such words as \"nation\" and \"station\". Shaw's joke, which is indeed valid, and his play,on, which illustrates the fine points of phonetics, pokesfun at linguistics and crucities the notion that there is only one \"correct\" and \"intel-ligent\" way of speaking English, strongly reinforce Webster's premise.Webster introduced American English into the language's mainstream and co-ordinately invited the English speaking world into America's dynamic, spiritedculture.His brilliant dictionary, far surpassing Johnson's, earned him an eminentposition among the greats of the English language. 76 85 it OBJECTIVES: The student will realize that meanings of words change in time.The student will learn that a word means what a particular communityThe student will be able to identify and explain four processes of lexicalchanges: elevation, degradation, specialization, and generalization. I1at a particular time intends it to mean.CHANGE AND VARIETY IN LANGUAGEPart IWords Change Meaning in Time Background:The study of how meanings change should be preceded by some investigationof the history of the English. language so that the student will be familiar with the basichistorical and lingulotic terms. This section of the unit will also test and hopefullyimprove the student's facility in using the dictionary.Words do change and normally such changes occur in one of the following ways:1.There is an elevation or improvement in meaning.2.There is a degradation or deterioration in meaning.3.Words become generalized.4.Words become specialized.Note,: in this section the concern in not with lexical changes determined by con-text, but with the history of lexical changes.ELEVATIONfl !i [1Background:Whist do the terms \"Lady\" and \"lord\" mean to a person in the 20th century?Although there may be various shades of meaning illustrated through context,generally the wordssuggest,respect and esteem. The 20th century meanings, however,are not always the accepted meanings. \"Lady\", for example, once designated awoman in charge of baking bread, and the \"lord\" was the guardian of the bread. Theword \"fond\" has also undergone changes it once meant \"'oak h\". Such words haveimproved in meaning; that is, they have developed pleasing and dignified meanings.The Oxford English Dictionary provides a more detailed account of lexical changes, andthe students shouldbe encouraged to use this work in the activities suggested inthis unit. A rather vivid example of the elevation (and generalization) of meaning is 7786 illustrated by the OED in its description of the term \"bonfire\". The term now refers to any type of fire used to symbolize a celebration; however, this favorable meaningstarted with Samuel Johnson when he altered the spelling from \"bonefire\" to \"bon-fire\".Notice how the meaning has changed through the centuries;14th c.to 15th c.-a fire of bones burnt in the open air16th c.to 17th c.A fire to consume corpses17th c.to 18th c.A fire for destruction, as of heretics,proscribed books, trash, etc.18th c.to 19th c.The modern meaning of a fire of celebrationSuggested Classroom ActivitiesStudents could trace the changes or elevations which occurred in thefollowing terms:1.jewel 6.companion2.paradise 7.bible3.nice 8.dean4.knight 9.blesi5.squire 10.EasterThe results of such research could vary in depth. Some students may be con- cerned with the earliest recorded meaning as compared with the contemporarymeaning; others may use the OED to present a detailed account as seen in theexample of \"bonfire\".B.DEGRADATIONWord meanings are not always elevated; some are degraded. \"Silly\", for example, once meant \"good, blessed, innocent.\" An \"idiot\"WEL13\"one who did not hold office.\" A bribe was \"a scrap of bread.\"Suggested Classroom ActivitiesTrace the degradation process in the following terms using the same approachas employed in elevation:oniondeliriousdoom\",caitiffduncegiddy 787.crafty8.daft9.villain10.bedlam11.wanton12.boor C.GENERALIZATIONBackgroundVery specific meanings have become more general. A \"chest\" originallyreferred to a \"coffin\" and now refers to a container for any variety of commodities.Suggested Classroom Activitiesa.Again, using the dictionary, and in pF.rticular the OED, trace the gen-eralization process in each of the following:I.Caesar8.2.arrive9.3.Journey10.4.train11.5.chattel12.6.barn13.7.box14.grotesquebracedisasterhumorousquarantinetestlunatic15.alcohol16.candidate17.coach18.influence19.decimate20.marmalade b.Some students may investigate the history of the term \"humor\" and, ingreater depth, report on the \"Theory of the Humors.\"D.SPECIALIZATIONBackgroundSome meaning3 have generalized; others have meant wild animal\".

Why is that specific item designated by that particularterm?Note: Although this unit Is concerned primarily with the history of lexicalohanges, it also offers a fine opportunity to examine the etymology ofparticular terms,to review the history of the language, to increasefacility in dictionary use, and to reinforce the fact that words arearbitrary symbols. Part IIWords Change Meaning in Context OBJECTIVES:The student will define \"context\".The student will realize that, since many words have a variety ofmeanings, he must make it very clear through the structure ofhis sentence what meaning is intended.The student will know that a dictionary does nct prescribe meaning;it describes meaning. 80 8 fif s BackgroundIn part I of this unit the student investigated how word meanings change intime; he should now realize how he frequently changes word meanings in context.Such a study should again remind the student that his language is varied and versa-tile, and that ultimately a word's meaning is determined by context or actual use.Note: This lesson is beet done inductively.Suggested Classroom Activities1.Demonstrate how context can change the meaning of a particular word.The word \"run\" is commonly used to illustrate that context changes meaning. Askthe students to use the term in as many ways as possible,2.Select one of the following terms and use it in five different sentenceswith five different meanings. A sentence will not be satisfactory unless the meaningof the term is clear.a.fixb.cutc.deadd.ringe.flight3.,Rewrite the following sentences to eliminate ambiguous and vaguemeanings.a.He's dead.b.He ran.c.He gave her a ring.Note: The teacher should also select samples from student writing. 81 90) Part IIIVariety in Vocabulary, Grammar, and Pronunciation OBJECTIVES:The student will broaden the scope of his language choices so that he willbe able to adapt to a variety of social, academic, and professionalsituations.The student will realize that variations in language choices cannot beautomatically labeled correct or incorrect, that usage is relative.The student will be able to define and explain the followi..g terms:regional dialect, standard, English, formal and informal usage, col-loquialism, slang, jargon, prestige dialect. Background:1.VocabularyThe first two parts of this unit have been concerned with lexical changes asthey have occurred in time and as they occur in context. This final section willexamine the geographical, social, and situational variations in vocabulary, gram-mar, and, to a limited degree, pronunciation.A.Regional Dialects:What is a dialect? Too often people consider it an inferior form or variation ofa given language, and they associate the term with the stereotyped backwoods illiterate.Linguists, however, do not consider this term in a pejorative sense. A dialect is aspeech pattern in a language which varies from other speech patterns in the samelanguage in vocabulary, pronunciation, and grammatical structures. The most obvious dialects are those which are characteristic of particular geographical regions,but there are also variations within the social levels. Since regional dialects are the most obvious, a study of them seems the logical starting point.Linguistic geographers have divided the Untted States into three majorareas*Northern, Midland, and Southern. Each of these major areas contains further subdivisions.Northern:Eastern New England, New York City, Upstate New York and Western Vermont, across the northern section of the ccuntryto include northern Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Min-nesota, and also the very northern sections of Ohio, Lidiana,Illinois, Iowa, and South Dakota 8291 I IT Fl flNorth Midland:Just to the south of the Northern section and includesparts of Delaware, Maryland, Pennsylvania, West Virginia,Virginia, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Iowa, and Misson.i.iSouth Midland:Eastern Virginia, Virginia, West Virginia, Kentucky,Missouri, Arkansas, Tennessee, No..th Carolina, OklahomaEastern Southern:Parts ol North Carolina, South Carolina, Southern:Mississippi, Louisiana, Eastern Texas, SoithernArkansas, Eastern AlabamaWestern Southern:Western Texas, part of OklahomaNotice that lines are rather arbitrary; speech habits do not change at a particular line.For further refinements see A WORD GEOGRAPHY OF THEEASTERN UNITED STATES (Ann Arbor, Michigan: University OFFIIThigan Press,1949) ii3; Hans Kurath.All of these areas have their characteristic speech patterns, and withineach area there are further variations (Boston and Maine, for example). It has been noted above that a dialect is a variation in vocabulary, pronunciation, andgrammatical structures.There are many variations in word choice. What is cal- led a \"faucet\" in Northern, is called a \"spigot\" or a \"spicket\" in Midland mit.iSouthern.A baby \"creeps\" in Northern, but \"crawls\" in Mid' ...1c1 and Southern.To most people the most obvious variations occur in the ...lamer of pronun-ciations.The television medium has made most people vei y conscious of dialectalpronunciations of \"accents\". In Eastern New Angland the \"r\" is dropped in words such as ''barn\" and \"car\", whr ',vas, in New York and the Middle Atlantic area the\"r\" is added to words \"idear\". .\"le word \"greasy\" is used repeatedly as an example. In the Northern region it is pronounct d with an \"s\"; in the Southern area, with a \"z\".Grammatical differences are also plentiful. The Northern area will use, \"This is as far as I go. \";the Southern region will say, \"This is all the farther 1go\".Suggested Classroom ActivitiesThe first activity should be introductory and motkational in nature. The teacher might give the students the following list af terms and ask them to identifythe putt,' 'lar term which they use. It possible attempt to allow the students to in- vestigate any inquiry into the other terms. Some students may be acquainted with terms that are not characteristic of tke Northern or the New England dialect. Suchstudents rhould be asked how they made contact with the term. After the students have selected the familiar terms, then the teacher might tart a discussion of the arious geographical area\u00b0. (The scope of such a study should be adjusted to thelevel of the class.) 8392 cheese, clabber Ives pop For flymosquito hawkgutters corn ponecorn breadgoobersrxlapopsoda pop the literature read or the television watched makea list of terms that az' 3 not part of the local regional dialect. 85 3.Write a short narrative utilizing the vocabulary o! a non-local dialect.Perhaps students could create a conversation between two peoplespeaking different dialects.4.The students will have noticed that certain terms are commonly used:frying pan, siding, cottage cheese. Perhaps the students might offer reasons for their common acceptance. How does advertising tend toeliminate regional variations?5.What differences in vocabu!ary exist in American English and British English?Samples of other variations:Northern Midland Southernquarter of elevenquarter till on his stomachsick at his stomachsick in his stomachB.Social aspects of languageBackground:Language use varies geographically, but it also varies within a geographicarea.The speech habits of the Boston teenager are not those of an erudite Harvardprofessor' those of the Italian immigrant are not those of the Boston Brahmin; thoseof the black are not those of the white; those of the educated are not those of theuneducated.Language use varies not only according to age, education, or culturalbackground but also according to occupation or profession. Each of these units orgroups which share common speech habits are called speech communities. Does theexistence of so many speech communities deny the existence of a standard usage? Notat all.There Is an obvious standard used by the people who conduct the importantaffairs of the nation - economic, governmental, and educational business of the country.They must be able to adapt to the standardThis unit will examine the varieties of social usage. $695 r 1.Standard Usage IOBJECTIVE:The student will understand what standard usage is and realize thatany improvement in his social and economic status is dependent uponhis ability to communicate according to the standard. 11Background:Standard usage is not easy to define, but students should realize that it is thetype of language used to run the important affairs of the country. There are twogeneral groups within the standard: formal, and informal or colloquial. Formalusage is a very dignified variety, and is normally employed in circi'mstances which aresocially rigid.Informal or colloquial usage is chiefly conversational and is the mostpredominant variety. ..Variations in PronunciationBackground:The study of vocabulary variations offers no particular problems, but the studyof pronunciation (or accents as they are often called) is more complex. The teacheris the best judge of a particular class and can most competently determine its ability.In some classes the students might investigate how certain words vary in pronuncia-tion from region to region. An activity for such an approach is suggested below.Other students might progress beyond this point to a study of graphemes and phonemes.bested Classrcom Activities1.The teacher might provide the class with the following list of v.ords andgive them a few days to investigate the different pronunciations. The studentsmight listen to television as well as watch it; carefully listen to conversations;perhaps interview various people with cpri.f ally prepared questions which will re- )quire the person to use the word the student wants to hear. The manner of student 1reporting should be kept fairly simple. The students might Just try to spell thevariations as they hear them.

The word \"clove\", for instance, is the usual form in the Northern area, whereas \"dived\" Is the common expressionin the Southern and Midland.Student Enrichment Activities1.The student might examine the text of a Presidential address. How doesthe language differ from the language of the sports cohitan. How does it differ from the language used by the President in a news conference?2.Students, working in groups, might select a topic for a speech. They are to write two versions: one to be delivered at a school assembly, theother In a more informal situation where only their peers will be present. 8891' 2.Slang, cant, and jargon OBJECTIVES:The student will discover that slang expressions can limit effectivecommunication.The student will realize that some slang terms disappear from use,some remain slang forever, and others are absorbed into the standardusage.The student will discover the various ways slang originates.The student will distinguish slang from cant and jargon. Background:What is slang?Paul Roberts declares that \"it is one of those things thateverybody can recognize and nobody can define.\" Definition difficulties are perhapscaused by the ever-changing nature of slang expressions. The slang of one generation may very easily be the standard of another. How then can slang be distinguished from cant, jargoL, barbarisms, and informal English? In order to separate knowed\", OttoJespersen distinguishes between \"words conscious contrast to the natural ornormal Speech\" (slang) and expressions such as ''them men\" which are the normalspeech patterns of the uneducated (barbarism or vulgarism). Thus, when a per- son consciously chooses to -.se \"squash\" or \"bean\" for \"head\", he is using slangexpressions.The distinction between cant and jargon on the one hand and slang on theother is easier to see.Cant is designed to be unintelligible to those outside aparticular speech coramunW, e. g., the underworld community will create wordsand phrases to ensure secrecy in communication, Jargon is a term applied to the special vocabulary used in any given walk of life, an it will be unintelligible to people outside the particular Cusiness, profession, or trade. Some terms which originate as cant or Jargon do not always remain so; often such terms beco:nemore generally understood and thus enter the world of slang and may even becomepart of standard usage.The word \"slang\" was first used in England in the eighteenth century andmay have been derived from \"slanguage\" with the initial \"s\" coming from such anexpression as \"thieves' language.\"Although the term \"slang\" may be relatively new, the practice of wag slangdates back to the earliest records of writter. language. Mario Pei in The Story of Language cites this example:8998' The slang use of the name of a piece of pottery for the head, similarto our \"crackpot\", has counterparts in many ancient languages:Sanskrit used Rapala (literally, \"dish\"), while the Latin use of testa(\"pot\") in the place of the legitimate caput gave rise to the French andItalian legitimate words for \"head\", tese and testa.There are, in fact, many linguists who believe that the Romance languages are theoffspring of the Vulgar or slang Latin.Where does slang originate? How are various slang terms formed? Slang expressions originate in various speech communities and terms are formed throughrather simp!e, and yet frequently creative, means.1.Slang from cant. - Many expressions and terms make the t* ansitim:from cant to slang when they become more generally intell, ;ibleoutside the speech community which has initiated them. Certain gangster terms, for example, have become part of the generalslang through their use in the movies, on television andin the comics.The following terms were once the private for other weapon.2.Slam fromJargon.- Words and expressions which were once apart of the entertainment world are now quite commonly understoodalthough they may not yet be considered as part of the standardvernacular:'for notthe only field which has produced jargon whicti has become \"marine\",\"swabby\" expressions such as \"goldbrick\",\"doughboy\" and \"jeep\", are known beyond this particular speechcommunity.3.Slang from innovations and important world events., - Wars, massimmigrations, changes in fashion, etc. , contribute to the develop- ment of slang expressions dixieland, folk rock, pop, long hair 40 99,''III I J Ie.Hair styles: butch, crewcut, whiffle, bleached blonde,peroxide teaseThe limitless.4.Slang from borrowings- The term \"crank\"(a disagreeableperson) is from 5.Clippings- The most popular meansof forming slang expres-sions is or clipping of standard terms:a.vet-veteran or veterinarianb.doc-doctorc.phone -telephoned.prof-professore.exam -examinationSome clippings have outlived the. original words:a.bunk-buncombeb.bus-omnibusc.cab-cabriolet6.Semantic charge -Some words may not be considered as slangermsse, bet can be used as slang.

PHONEMES OBJECTIVES:The student will know what phonemes are.The student will be able to distinguish between phonemes and graphemes.The studentknow the terms \"voiced\" and \"unvoiced\" phonemes.The student will the phonemic difference between consonants and vowels. Background:The primacy of speech over written language is a basic tenet of all linguistic study. Any investigation Into the nature of language leads to the discovery that language is primarily a set of speech sounds. Although humans are able to make unlimited numbars of speech sounds, only those from which we distinguish mean- ings become basic units of our language. There seems to be no limit to the sounds 92101:I that could be recognized and described, even in the speech of one person. Sounds, therefore, which are represented alike in writing are really different in speech.Variance in speech sound occurs due to vocal pitch, \u00b0tress, and intonation.Each language has its own system of speech sounds, and the basic speechsounds of any language are arbitrary. Speakers of a language choose the basic sounds of their language and attach meaning to them. These \"chosen\" or agreed upon sounds are phonemes.Phonemes, therefore, may be defined as minimal units of meaningful sound.In English, linguists distinguish forty-five distinctspeech sounds.Written symbols have been devised to represent these phonemes.They are generally represented by placing a symbol, letter, or letters betweendiagonal Hues.(/p/, /0/, /ey/, etc.)Written phonemes should not be confused with graphemes, which are writtensymbols that do not distinguish between variances in sound for the same writtensymbol. The principal graphemes of the English language are the letters of the alpha-bet, plus phonemes. Thegraphemes to illustrate the difference between graphemes andphonemes. The symbols are always written the same as graphemes, but are repre-sented six different ways as phonemes:A.graphemephonemein \"any\"/e/\"a\" as in \"father\"/a/\"a\" as in \"above\"/e/\"a\" as in \"tall\"/o/\"a\" as in \"hat\"/ae/\"a\" as in \"gate\"/ey/\"o\" as in \"women\"/i/\"o\" as in \"hot\"/a/\"o\" as in \"son\"/a/\"o' as in \"wolf'/u/\"o\" as in \"note\"/ow/\"o\" as in \"move\"/uw/B.The same phoneme sound can be represented several different waysas a grapheme.The sounfl of \"a\" /a/ in \"across\" can be written a, al, e,ea, i, la, o, oe, ol, oo, ou, u.C.Students should gain some awareness of how they create distinctivespeech sounds:1.English speech sounds basically are made through controlof a stream of air expelled from the lungs. The air is con- 931021'. trolled, stopped or in some way impeded through the use ofthe lips, tongue,and teeth.Students should pronounce a few simple words aloud toobserve the movement of their tongues, lips, and the use ofthe teeth.(the, and, like, find, put, all, etc. )2.The vocal cards may or may not be vibrated as the stream ofair passes over them.If the vocal cords are vibrated, thesound is termed a voiced phoneme. If the vocal cords are not vibrated, the sound is termed an unvoiced or voicelessphoneme.Students can practice placing their fingers on their Adam'sapples (part of the larynx) and speaking aloud. When they feel a vibration they have used a voiced phoneme. A similareffect is achieved by placing their hands over theirVoiced phonemes produce a humming sound.3.Consonants are sounds made when the lips or tongue stop orimpede th3 stream of air.Some are voiced; others are un-voiced.Again, have students pronounce the consonants aloud. They should become aware of how they uncwisciously use theirtongues and lips.They should also be able to distinguishthe voiced and unvoiced consonants.4.Vowels are sounds made with the clear passage of air throughthe mouth.The tongue, lips, and jaw are used to controlthe sound, but not to stop or impede it. All vowels are voiced.Teachers interested in a more thorough study of phonemes and graphemesare referred to the following texts.1.Language and Rhetoric.Holt, Rinehart a is Winston, Inc.2.New Approaches to Language and Composition.

Background:A study of morphemes is littended to help students understand how English wardsare constructed.Knowledge and understanding of morphemes will enable students tounderstand better the workings of prefixes, suffixes, and root words, as well as theformation of plurals a, Id porditessives. Ultimately it is hoped that such an under-standing will help students to increase their vocabularies and overcome spellingdifficulties.If students were asked whatthe smallest unit of meaning was in the Engi,language, they would probably say that it was a word.In answering this waywould only be partially correct. Some words are the smallest possible unit:meaning, but many are not.To illustrate this concept, the teacher might askdents what \"un\", or \"In\" means. What does the\"s\" mean in the word \"dogs\"or the \"ed\" in the word\"walked\"? Students should have little difficulty defined,such \"non-words\".Obviously these letters and groups 1 letters are not wordthey do have meaning.These units of meaning areidentified by linguists as morphemes. Lingodefine a morpheme as the smallest unit of meaning in the language; morphemethe smallest units of word formation. Morphology Is tha description of morph(and their combinations to form words. Whereas syllables are divisions of wox dunits of sound, morphemes are divisions of words into units of meaning. Forthe word \"dogs\" would be described as having one syllable because it consistone sound unit. A linguist,however, would describe the word as having twophemes: \"dcg\" (the root or base morpheme) and \"s\" (the plural morpheme).Aithougl. the \"s\" is not a word, it does carry meaning, and is, therefore, als(morpheme. The word \"apple\" could be described as having two syllables,because it consists of two units of sound. Yet the linguist would describe itconsisting of one morpheme, because it contains only owl unit of meaning,It is important to note that a morpheme does not always consist of a se(part of a wo.'cl.It may simply be represented as a sound change within a weword \"men\", for example, consists of two morphemes; \"man\" and the plural 95104 Have students distinguish the be distinguish between division by syllablesand division by morphemes.Basically n.orphemes are divided into two groups, free morphemes and boundmorphemes:1.Free morphemes can stand alone as words. The morpheme \"tie\" in the word \"untied\" is a free morpheme because it can standalone as a word.2.Bound morphemes cannot stand alone and must be attached to other morphemes.The \"un\" and \"Li\" in \"untied\" are boundmorphemes.Words consist of combinations of free and bound morphemes.Morphemes are further divided into kinds:1.Base or root morphemes are morphemes that carry the principalmeaning a word.In the word \"leadership\", \"lead\" is the basemorpheme.Bases may be free or bound morphemes. in the word \"democracy\", \"demo\" is the base or root, but cannot standalone as a word; it is, therefore, a bound morpheme. 96 1 WI:t Ir2.Affixes are morphemes that are attached before or after a base.These include prefixes, suffixes, plurals and the free morphemes, \"ship\", \"less\",and \"super\".Perhaps it would be sufficient to point out to stu-dents that morphemes are affected by their function and maytherefore appear as both bound and free, depending on how theyare used.If a morpheme is used as an affix, it is bound: if itis used as a base, it is free.In their study of wcrd formation, students should be able to distinguish betweenfree and bound morphemes. They should generally be able to see that prefixes, suf-fixes, plural endings and possessive endings axe all hound morphemes. Roots canbe free morphemes, but when they are derived from Latin and Greek borrowings,they are bound morpnemes. GREEK AND LATIN ROOTS OBJECTIVES:The student will learn common Greek and /-Aatin roots.The student will learn to trace word derivations in the dictionary. Background:Since thousands of English words are Greek and Latin derivatives, aknowledge o: common Creek and Latin roots will help students to infer the meaningsof unfamiliar words and help them to increase their vocabulary. In studying roots,students should be cautioned to consult their dictionaries often. Words containingGreek and Latin roots change and shift in meaning, although the roots remain teesame.TI:e word \"prevent\", derived from the Latin prae and venire, originallymeant \"to come beforer'.Su h changes in meaning malTit necessary to checkp-eseat meanings in the dictionary. Students should be aware that original ..ieaningsare not always current meanings.The teacher should not require students to memorize lists of Greek andLatin roots.Students are more likely to remember root meanings if they studyseveral words with the same root. This unit is intended to be taug in small seg-ments throughout the year.It might be taught in weekly lessons or integrated withstudy of the history of the English language. students form as many present -day words as possible by addingprefixes and suffixes to roots. Words should be checked in the dictionary for original and current meanings.2.Have students trace the derivations of an opportunity for students to review prefixes and suffixes)3.The teacher should also review with students those parts of a dictionaryentry which they will need to use to determine word derivations.4.Have students keep a record of words with Greek and Latin roots whichthey collect from their veading throughout the year. THE DICTIONARY OBJECTIVES:The student will study in depth three dictionary entries selected by the teacher.The student will understand the terms:1.syllabication1syllable3.phonetic spoiling4.etymology5.archaic wordThe student will be able to identify the major symbols used in a typical entry:1.parts of speech2.singular and plural3.etymological abbreviations4.synonyms and antonyms Suggested Classroom ActivitiesReview what should already know about dictirnaries. See \"Grade VIIDictionary\". 991Q8 Review units on synonyms and antonyms and Greek and Latin prefixes andsuffixes.The teacher should choose three word:,i, each of which is rooted in a differentlanguage.\"Monotheism\", \"renaissance\" and \"housewife\" are suitable examples.The teacher will lead the class through a &tailed study of the first of the three 1.vords.Careful questioning should enable the student to know what boldface type is, whythe initial section of an entry (the word itself) is bold - faced, what the syllabicationof a word is and what a syllable is.Next, the student will realize what the phonetic spelling is for, that ofteng. eat differences exist between phonetic and actual spellings and that the accentmark is the sign of the stressed syllable. The student should also know that polysyllabic words have primary and secondary accent marks. The various partsof speech symbols should be reviewed as well as the concepts of singular and plural.In brackets, before definitions are offered, comes a word's etymology.Students should know that etymology examines word origins and that it is an ancientstudy, probably originating in Hebrew scholars' examination of the Old Testament.Students should be able to recognize and identify the common language symbols: L forLatin.OE for Old English, Ar for Arabic, Gk for Grath., etc. This makes a good prelude to comparisons of Old, Middle and Modern English which are includedin the Grade VU1 \"Study of Language\" unit.Finally, students should understand the order of arrangements of definitionsand the ideas of antonyms and synonyms.The second and third words should be studied with students providing explana-tions of each item of the entries based upon previous learning.Student Enrichment ActivitiesTo illustrate the great differences in the English language, most scholarssuggest a comparison of Old, Middle, Early Modern, and Later Modern versions of\"The Lord's Prayer\".Higher groups, using mimeographed sheets with a fe'v linesin each period's language will illustrate the changes.Students will explore the thesaurus. 100 ' THE SENTENCE AND ITS PARTSPartReviewA.Classification of sentencep,1.declarative2.interrogative.3.imperative4.exclamatoryB.Forms of sentence31.simple2.compound3.complexG.Prepositional (participle)Part VVerbal PhrasesA.Gerund phrasesB.Participle phrasesNote: The teacher should use diagnostic tests to determine if review of thismaterial is necessary. 101110x; Grade VIII - Reference Books OBJECTIVES:The student will become aware of the many and varied sources of informationavailable, other than the standard dictionary and encyclopedia.The student will visit a branch library. Suggested Classroom Activities:The introduction to the use of reference books, other than dictionaries andgeneral encyclopedias, should be timed to coincide with a field trip to the nearestpublic library.Librarians are most cooperative if teachers consult them first, in-vite them to the school, or schedule class visits in advance. Boston Public School librarians are most helpful also. When the librarian's assistance is sought in advance, she will assemble samples of variouk. reference books to show students.Before the librarian arrives, or the class goes to the library, the teachershould provide the students with several questions, the answers to which are notreadily found, if found at all, in the classroom dictionary or encyclopedia. These questions might come from tie fields of medicine, sports, etc.At the end of the teacher's or librarian's presentation of reference books,students should find answers to their questions, after first having attempted to guessat the answers.All students should become aware of and be able to use:1.The atlas2.Who's Who3.Encyclope-ala of Sports4.Guinness Book of booksAll how to use a standard encyclopedia. Good en- cyclopedias available include:1.pluclopedir. JuniorStudent Enrichment Activities:Higher groups should become familiar with the following reference books:1.Bartlett's Familiar Quotations2.Reader's Guide to Periodical Literature3.Living Authors4.Roget s ThesaurusNote: Publishers of audio-visual materials to be used in the teaching ofreference books are listed in the Grade VII unit on the dictionary. MASS MEDIA - 7' HE NEWSPAPER OBJECTIVES:The student will know the parts of a newspaper.The student will becomv skilled ,n reading and using the newspapereffectively for the services it offers to the public.The student will become aware that newspapers attempt to influence aswell as inform.The student will learn to read the newspaper critically, to distinguishbetween fact and opinion, and to become aware of the effective useof language.Background:The study of the newspaper in the classroom should be viewed, not in isola-tion, but from the broader aspect of the mass media. Students should becomeaware of the overwhelming influence and power of all forms of mass communications:television, radio, magazines, newspapers, and all manner of advertising. Fromthis viewpoint, the newspaper should be presented both as an instrument of service,and as a commercial venture subject to the pressures and pitfalls of free enter-prise.Students should learn that because of its commercial nature, a newspaperoften falls short of its goal of objectivity, that it often attempts to influence as well. asinform its readers.The study of the newspaper offers almost limitless opportunity for the examin-ation of languagP.Perhaps its greatest asset is that the newspaper is current. 103112 It keeps pace with the changing world and our changing language. Newspapers reflect levels of language, variety in language, correct and incorrect use oflanguage, and even beauty in language. They offer examples to illustrate the power of language, for good and bad, when used by skilled professionals, and provide theopportunity to develop critical thinking in students.Because the newspaper presents current, pertinent, and self-motivatingreading material,it offers a bridge between the world of the student and the school.It speaks of things that interest him; it contains something for everyone. Since all students will become somewhat dependent on the services that the newspaperprovides, and many will use the newspapers as their major source of readingmaterial when they finish school, it is vital that they read it with skill. The a.!;ility to read critically, be able to distinguish between fact and opinion, and usethe newspaper effectively for the services it provides are realistic ond practicalgoals to be achieved.Excellent materials for use of the newspaper in the classroom are availablefrom both the Boston Herald-Traveler and Boston Globe. Both newspapers are willing and, indeed, eager to provide these materials for the interestedteacher.These newspapers also make editions available at reduced rates forclassroom use.Suggested Classroom Activities:1.Perhaps the best way to begin a study of the newspaper is to determinehow familiar students are with newspapers and what their readinghabits are.This can be accomplished through the use of a question-naire.Questions should include such items as:a.Do you like to read?b.Do you read the newspaper regularly?c.When you do read the newspaper which one do you read mostoften?d.What sections of the newspaper interest you most?e.What newspaper does your family buy?f.From what source do you receive most of your information aboutcurrent events?g.What do you think a newspaper is?h.List as many services or parts contained in a newspaper aspossible.104 Such a questionnaire will supply the teacher with a general view of a background ofa particular class and guide his teaching.2.Students should become familiar with the parts of a newspaper.a.News storiesb.Editorialsc.Features(1)Entertainment1 (a)comics(b)radio-T.

This activity offers opportunity to examine the front page of a newspaper. Students should discover the areas covered by a news story (local, national, and international), and become aware of its source(staff reporter, wire service, etc.). Analysis of the structure of the news story isa valuable aid to composition.1.headline2.leada.Whob.Whatc.When .1 d.Wheree.Whyf.How3.Supporting details (body)Have students analyze news stories and label the sections of the lead.The Feature StoryIn contrast to the news story, the feature story is characterized by aleisurely style and structure, It deals essentially with topics meant to appeal to the emotions, arouse curiosity, evoke pity, entertain, or stir the imagination.Feature stories fall generally into four categories:1.social comment2.human interest3.humor4.informative materialIn a feature story the writer expresses opinion supported by fact. Students, therefore, should be able to analyze the feature story to determine if the writer 106 11 I offers facts to support his opinione, and what qualifications he has to form opinionson specific topics.The EditorialEditorials are valuable to bring about in students an awarenet,s of the powerof the printed word w,..en used skillfully. They should be able to distinguish between fact and opinion in editorials, and further, how many facts are cited to support aneditor's opinion.Editorials have essentially four purposes:1.to inform2.to influence3.to interpret the news4.to entertainThe style, structure, and level of language in an editorial vary depending upon theeditor's purpose.Students should examine editorials which offer examples of theformal, informal, and colloquial use of language.In a related activity students shouid examine and compose letters to theeditor.They should be aware that the level of language they use will reveal certaininio7mation.5.The newspaper offers a valuable source of written material with ahigh interest level which can be used to teach grammar, usage, andmechanics.a.sentence varietyb.use of vivid, forceful verbsc.use of picturesque nouns and colorful adjectivesd.devices used for brevity appositives, phases, clauses.e.synonyms, acronyms, neologisms, etc.f.use of connotative languageg.use punctuation, quotation marks, ab-breviations, etc.Student Enrichment Activities1.Political cartoons offer opportunity for the study of the use of symbols,exaggeration, satire, opinion vs. fact, caricature, etc. Students shouldbecome familiar with common symbols; the donkey, elephant, UncleSam, eagle, etc. 107116. 2.Practice in use of the index and listings.3.Comics offer an entertaining media for analysis of:a.human frailtiesb.didactic approachc.realistic approachd.satiree.levels of languagef.effective use of language - puns, jokes, connotative meanings, etc.4.Students might compare various newspapers and become familiar with\"prestige\" newspapers.Boston Record - American - tabloidBoston Herald-Traveler - metropolitan dailyChristian Science Monitor - Internationally knownNational Observer - national weeklyHide Park Tribune - local weeklyQuincy Patriot Ledger - suburban daily 5.Field trips to newspaper plants.6.Have students compose classified ads.7.Compare letters to the editor to letters appearing in advice columns forlevels of language, vocabulary, etc.8.Prepare crossword of newspaper terms.9.Send for out of state and foreign newspapers.

Teach.l.r Background:There are many definitions of what writing is. One thing is definite; writing is an artificial; unnatural, invented process, differing markedly from speech,which is a natural aspect of being human. Man was speaking at least 250,000years ago; some experts claim that man's speech is more than a million yearsold.Writing is a much more recent occurrence. Man first wrote about 3100 B. C. ,appoximately t',000 years ago. Of the myriad definitions offered of writing, perhaps these are the most succinct:I.Writing is an arbitrary set of symbols invented to represent inone of many ways, - syllabic, alphabetic, hieroglyphic, - thelanguage of a people.2.Writing is the act or art of using characters to record in visiblesigns, the ideas, words, or sounds of a language. 113120 When writing's origin is dated 3100 B. C., scholars Jo not mean to infer thatbefore then there were no signs carved or painted in various places which could com-municate meaning.Indeed, there were many of these meaningful signs used perhapsfor hundreds of thousands of years. But these signs are not classified as writing per se, ; they are called pictographs. The pictograph is a very simple painted or carved picture, which means exactly what it looks like. Thus, a picture of a deer carved into a tree trunk or painted on a rock one hundred thousand years ago possiblymeant that there were deer near the area, and that the area was a good huntingground. Why the pictograph, though a forerunner of writing, is not classified aswriting is apparent. The symbol could be so badly inscribed that its meaning was notclear,Only a few simple messk7es could be communicated and perhaps not interpre-ted as their creators intended.A bit more sophisticated in the pre-writing, sign-making process is theideograph. An ideograph, again, is a painted or carved picture. However, it represents not the object it looks like, but the idea that the object conveys. Implied here is the concept of an agreeing community, which is knit well enough to enableall the members to see the same idea when the picture is used. One example ofthe ideograph is a picture of a crown which could stand for the community's ruler.Seeing th, crown, carved or painted on anything, would mean to all that this wasthe property or province of the monarch.Another type of sign-message is the lo ra h.It permits simpler signs and allows for more exact transmission of i eas. Each sign used represents one particular idea or word in the spoken language. In a system of logographs, the reader, as long as he is part of the community, understands the signs exactly anddoes not have to gu,,ss at meaning or read into and possibly misinterpret the sign.If a crown meant the word \"king\", and an arrow the word \"kill\", and a circle theword \"animal\", then a crown followed by an arrow, followed by four circles, wouldread: \"The king killed four animals. \"Pictographs, ideographs and logographs were used by man perhaps hundredsof thousands of years before writing appeared on the plains of Sumero-Babylonia.Sometime late in the forth millenium before Christ, the date 3100 B. C. isarbitrary, Sumerians in Mesopotamia (Iraq) realized that the pictures that theyhad been using for years could stand for sound combinations, or syllables. Thiswas not an overnight discovery, but a logical progression from the pictograph.The Sumerians began to use pictures as symbols for sounds, not for objects, ideas,or whole words. They were this able to reduce the needed number of signs, andslJwly the cuneiform method of writing evolved. In cuneiform, wedge-shaped im- pressions in various meaningful arrangements are made on a clay tablet with asharp slender implement called a stylus. Centuries and cultures later, the stylus and tablet were still com,nonplace. Indeed, Julius Caesar fended off the first blows of his assassins with a stylus, according to Luigi Barzini. Oddly enough, it was 'merchants, concerned with bills of lading, receipts, accounts, and records,who gave wiling its unglamorous beginning. Unglamorous it may be, but to mosthistorians the development of writing was the most vital step from barbarism tocivilization that Mall made. 114121' Shortly after cuneiform appeared in Sumeria, Egypt, in the process ofraising the world's first brilliant imperial civilization, gave birth to a form ofhieroglyphic writing.Egyptian priests and scribes were the chief users of hiero-glyphics which went through stages of development as did the nation which spawnedit.At first, with an involved set of pictographs and ideographs, the Egyptianhieroglyphic system slowly became simplified into a syllabic form of writing whichmade it eminently more usable.By 2500 B. C. a similar hieroglyphic writing system appeared in Crete. At other spots along the Mediterranean various forms of writing, based no doubt onthose of Egypt and Crete, great trading nations, became used.In Egypt writing was not at a standstill. Gradually signs began to take on newsignificance.They were being used not to represent a whole syllable, but thevarious initial sounds of the syllables. This was the advent of alphabetic writing, writing in which the signs are called letters, each of which represents one sound.The people of Crete developed a similar system by 1600 B. C.And yet this most important step, the origin of alphabetic writing, is creditedneither to Egypt nor Crete. A small commercial nation, Phoenecia, receives thehonor, not because Phoenecians invented alphabetic writing, but because theyquickly adopted it, all through the Mediterranean region. By 800 B. C. the Greeks had taken over the system, making changes in the process, and calling it by theSemitic names \"aleph\" and 'beth\", which became the Greek \"alpha\" and 'beta\",and filially alphabet.Originally each letter in the alphabet represented one sound in the spokenlanguage, but with borrowings, coinings, and vowel shifts, this has changed. The alphabet which the Phoenecians spread consisted of twenty-two symbols, all forconsonant sounds.Vowels had no written representation; the reader supplied hisown to the context.After the Phoenecians, alphabets appeared to represent theArabic, Persian and Indian languages. Whether the Hebrew alphabet pre-dates thealphabet spread by the Phoenecians is a matter of cebate.The Greeks changed many of the letters' shapes and added visual. representation(letters) for vowel sounds, a worthy and needed addition. Etruscans, the brilliant, cultivated, but still mysterious people who ruled Italy before the Romans, pickedup the alphabet from the Greeks. The Etruscan language has not yet been deciphered, presenting to the twentieth century much the same riddle that hieroglyphicsoffered to the nineteenth.The Romans received the concept of an alphabet from theEtruscans whom they overwhelmed.One of history's more interesting speculat'.ons concerns the Etruscanlanguage. Emperor Claudius, who ordered the conquest of Britain, was a notedlinguist and grammarian before his unexpected ascent to the imperial throne.Claudius' most important project, before the business of empire and the dalliancesof his wife, Messalina, undividedly occupied his attention, was the compilation ofa Latin-Etruvan dictionary. The Etruscan language was almost dead, andClaudius realized the importance of preserving its meaning for history. This dictionary is mentioned by many scholars, contemporaries of Claudius, and later 115122 wr Lers, yet there is no trace of it with which modern scholars might crack themysterious Etruscan language. What happened to this celebrated volume? Will it, or a copy of it ever be discovered, serving as a type of Rosetta Stone for Etruscanlanguage.By the time the Romans were asserting themselves on the Italian peninsula,Egyptians had ceased to use hieroglyphic writing and the beautiful symbols hadbegun to lose meaning, slowly becoming mysteries even to Egyptians who werewriting in Demotic, a type of shorthand, part Egyptian-part Greek, which was moreefficient though less aesthetic. For more than two thousand years, hieroglyphics were consider,d nothing more than part of the exotic decoration in which the highlyembellished Egyptian c1-iilization revelled. Then in 1799, as Napoleon's expedition- ary army forged through Egypt, several French soldiers discovered a strange stoneat the Rosetta mouth of the Nile Delta. Napoleon had, opportunely, brought a legion of scholars with him (of much more benefit to civilization than his soldiers) whowere opening up Egyptology. The stone, called the Rosetta Stone, was examined and three sets of inscriptions were perceived. One, in Greek, was understandable.The others, Demotic and hieroglyphic, were incomprehensible. The Stone was brought to Europe where a young French linguist, Jean Clamp\u00b0 Mon, devoted sometwenty-odd years to decoding its inscriptions. First he cracked Demotic, and afterpainstaking work decoded the hieroglyphics. The results of his work were publishedin 1822, and since then knowledge of Egypt has multiplied immeasureably.The Egyptian system 13 not the only hieroglyphic writing system man had devel-oped.It is necessary to remember that Olmec, Maya, Toltec and Aztec civilizationsin Central America were using highly sophisticated hieroglyphic systems at the sametime the Egyptians were.This has led to much speculation about inter-relationships,most flamboyantly illustrated by the recent voyage of Thor Hyerdahl's ill-fated \"Ra\".The Roman version of the alphabet, fully developed by 100 A. D. , originallycontained twenty-ona letters. On official documents and monumental inscriptionsonly capital letters were used. These were basically the same letters today'sworld is familar with and calls the Roman Alphabet. Ordinary writing, such as business matters, letters, etc., was another matter. The Romans used cursives which were small, rounded, joined letters. Words were connected and punctuation was not used, making cursives much less familiar looking than the easily recognizablecapital letters.This Roman alphabet is the same one Augustine and his monks brought toEngland with them.There were no signs for the sounds now represented by theletters \"j\", \"g\", \"v\" and \"z\". Old English did use two different symbols for the\"th\" sound.The monks and later the laymen who worked in secular writing shopscalled scriptora continued to use the capital letter', often beautifully adorned andelaboratedupon, and the small joined cursives all through the Middle Ages withoccasional changes in style. The movable metallic type, invented by Gutenberg and brought to England by Laxton, used the Roman capitals, called majuscules, andsmall letters, based on the cursives of the time, called minuscule. With theRenaissance came Italic writing, much more recognizable to modern man who still 118123 uses a form of it called \"italics\". Since then styles in handwriting have changed.Elizabethan writing was wild, individualistic and highly indicative of the writer'spersonality.Later, in the eigateenth century, writing became highly stylized,formalized, and occasionally quite artistic. Like the pendulum, writing styles vary from the rigid to the free and back again, but what is vital is that writing exists andis used extensively, so much so that it even has fashions.Voltaire once said, \"I want to know what were the steps by which men passedfrom barbarism to civilization\". Perhaps those steps were three: 1.The development of the idea of writing.2.The refinement of writing into an alphabetic system.3.The rapid spread and wide acceptance of alphabetic writingwhich, enabled recording of knowledge, assembling ofliterature, and exchangint, of ideas internationally, all ofwhich comprise history.English history is shrouded in myth, mystery, and hints of migration longafter the mists have cleared from the civilizations of the Near, Middle and Far East.The first fact scholars are sure of as regards England is that by the year 2000 B. C.it was inhabited by Iberians, a short, dark people related to tribes in Spain, Portugaland the Basque region.All these tribes are thought to have originated inMauretania, North Africa.Between 2000 and 1700 B.C., these Iberians, who ob-viously spoke, but of whose language there Is no trace, erected on Salisbury Plainthe impressive, puzzling assemblage of massive monoliths, Stonehenge. Some ofthe stones, weighing many tons, were brought hundreds of miles. How they wereembedded, how the crossbars were raised, is all a matter of conjecture, butsurely a piercing Intelligence supervised this seemingly Impossible project. Moreimpossible still, yet apparently true, according to the recently publishedStonehenge Decoded, written by a Boston University professor, is the fact that thestones, their surrounding rings, and central boulder comprise a sophisticated,highly accurate astronomical computer which marks seasons, midsummer lunareclipses, and solar eclipses. Another bothersome fact about Stonehenge is that for all its technical expertise, nothing but one tiny dagger-like mark possibly placedthere by Celts, is carved on any of the stones, not even a picture. Stonehengepuzzles, to say the least.Evidently, the Iberians were either wiped out or assimilated into the GaelicCelts (Gaels), an Indo-European tribe which invaded England around 600 B. C. TheGaels considered Stonehenge, constructed by the non-Indo-European Iberians, asacred place.There, the Druids, priests even more powerful than the Celtic chiefs,practiced human sacrifice.Swathed in white wool robes and religiously significantoak leaves, the Druids held a stranglehold over Celtic minds and gave the earlyChristian missionaries as much spiritial philosophical, and often physical opposi-tion as they encountered anywhere. 117124; A century after the arrival of the Gaels, around 500 B. C. more Celtic tribes,the Cymrii or Cymric Celts and the Britons battled their way through westernEurope and vished into England displacing the Gaels who retreated to Cornwall,Wales, Ireland, Scotland and the Isle of Man. For five centuries the Celts ruled the British Isles, painting themselves blue, dying their hair red, and terrifyingany non-Celt who happened into Britain. The Celts did not write, so knowledge of them is limited to what others said of them. They were much taller than the Romans who were impressed by Celtic height, extraordinary good looks, ferocity andpromiscuity.The Romans first appeared in England in the summer of 55 B. C. led byJulius Caesar.Unsuccessful, Caesar returned with a larger force earlier the nextsummer, 54 B. C.Yet he made no wide range conquest and pulled out after makingonly sketchy trade arrangements. Theorists suggest he was merely attempting to frighten the Celts in Britain, who had aided their fellow tribesmen (the Gauls) onthe continent in their wars against the Romans.The Celts battled fiercely but were subdued or pushed into the backwoodsareas of Scotland, Wales and Cornwall when the Romans came to stay in 43 A. D.These areas remained determinedly independent. After an abortive revolt, led by Boadicea, one of the Celtic tribes' queens, was crushed in 60 A. D., Romesolidified her hold on England. Military camps, called \"castra\", sprinkled through- out the country, became towns and cities connected by a network of highly efficientRoman roads. Reminders of these \"castra\" exist in the many English place namesderived from the word \"castra\" itself: Lancaster, Westchester, Manchester, Worcester, Gloucester.For three and a half centuries, England was a Romancolony; Latin was the official language, and slowly many Celts became Romanized.When Christianity became an influence in Rome, it had an impact in England also.Long after the Romans left, pockets of Christianity remained. The chapel Augustine used at Canterbury had had continuous Christian services since it wasbuilt.When Augustine arrived, a Celtic queen was conducting services there.The withdrawal occurred in 410 A. D. The emperor Honorious, threatened by barbarians, summoned to Rome's defense the legions which were scattered through-out the world.The Cells were in control of England once again, but they wereharried by the Picts and Scots. Seeking help, the Celts unwittingly invited theAnglo-Saxon Invasion.The Anglo-Saxon Invasion and the various events which influenced languagechanges since then were treated in the Grade Eight Background. Treated there also were the characteristics of the periods of English language: Old, Middle,Early Modern, and Later Modern.The concept of a language !amity is discussed in the Grade Seven Backgroundand in the Grade Seven section entitled \"Origins of Language\". was made ofthe Japanese-Korean, African-Negro, Ural-Altaic, Semetic and Sino-Tibetanlanguage families in the Grade Seven Background and the \"Origins\" section usedcognates for the concept of mother to illustrate relationships in the Indo-European 118125 Cognates are words in different languages which closely resemble one anotherin meaning and form or sound. They bear this close resemblance because bothcame from the same parent tongue. For example, \"arm\", meaning an upper limb of the body appears in exactly the same form, \"arm\" in English, Swedish, Danish,German and Dutch.Another example is the English word \"sun\", the star aroundwhich the solar system revolves. Cognates for this idea are:1.Frenchsoleil2.Spanishsol3.Portuguese sol4.Italiansole5.Swedishsol6.Danishsol7.Dutchzon8.GermanSonne (German nouns are always capitalized. )Throughout the sixteenth, seventeenth, and eighteenth centuries, writers,scholars, and observers commented on various seeming similarities between lan-guages.Sasetti mentioned the similar characteristics of Italian and Sanskrit.Englishmen noticed similarities between Hindustani, a descendant of Sanskrit, andclassical Greek and Latin.Sir Henry Jones defined the basic Indo-Europeanrelationships in 1786.Jacob Grimm proved that Germanic languages were Indo-European in 1822, and in 1861 August Schleicher reconstructed a basic grammarand vocabulary of the long lost, never recorded, Indo-European parent languageitself.This is the prehistoric tongue which gave birth to eight language branchescontaining 132 separate languages which are or were spoken in most of Europe andin Persia, Afghanistan and India. Today the Indo-European language family is theworld's most important.Although the language with the most speakers, MandarinChinese, is Sino-Tibetan, not Indo-European, at Least half the world's people speakone of the Indo-European languages as their native tongue.Because many of the Indo-European languages are politically, commercially,or culturally important, millions learn one of them, most often English, as asecond Language. A breakdown of the eight living branches of the Indo-Europeanfamily and some of the important languages in each branch follow:1.Indo-Iranian, the branch which grew out of ancient Sanskrit,the language closest to - died out in the fifth century A. D.b.North (Scandinavian) - the language of the Vikings(1)Icelandic(2)Norwegian(3)Danish(4)Swedishc.West(1)High German(a)Modern German(b)Yiddish(2)Low German(a)Dutch(b)Frisian(c)EnglishIt is interesting to note that some of the Indo-European branches consist ofonly one language while others contain large numbers of closely related tongues.Oddly enough, Low German left Germany, its derivatives being spoken outside ofGermany proper.The spread of High German from the mountains of SouthernGermany to the northern lowlands during the Renaissance is a result of Luther'stranslation of the Bible.English, then, is a variety of Low German of the West Germanic branch ofthe Teutonic or Germanic branch of the Indo-European language family.Although it is true that Mandarin Chinese, spoken by several hundred millionpeople, is the world's most spoken language, English is quite possibly the world'smost influential tongue.Not confined primarily to one geographical area, Englishhas more than four hundred million native speakers, one in ten of the world'spopulation, scattered over the globe. England, the United States, Australia, New Zealand, and the Union of South Africa use English as their native language.Canada, with two official languages, French and English, has many more speakersof English than French.Most Irish, Scots and Welsh speak English more often thanthey speak their Celtic tongues. Countries like Ghana and India conduct much of their official business in English to overcome difficulties created by differing tribaldialects.In these countries most educated people speak English fluently.It is estimated that approximately one hundred and fifty million people through-out the world use English as a second language. Most school children in countries as diffaent as Italy, Nigeria, Russia, Kenya and the Latin American nations studyEnglish in the course of Owl; school careers. English exerts tremendous influ- ence worldwide because it is the native language of the world's leading commercialcountry.In the last cenlury it Was British English which was exported to other 1211: nations.More and more in the twentieth century, with the rise of the United States,American English, more idiomatic, slangy and casual, has become the Englishinfluencing others.That there are distinct differences between British English and AmericanEnglish was pointed out as early as the eighteenth century by Thomas Jefferson,\"'The change in American English will in time sep: rate it from the mother tongue,\"and Noah Webster envisioned a language \"as different from the future language ofEngland as modern Dutch, Danish and Swedish are from the German.\" The differen-ces were rot noted only on this side of the Atlan.ic. The celebrated Dr. Samuel Johnsondenounced\"American dialect\" as \"a tract of corruption\" some twenty yearsbefore the American Revolution. Said Oscar Wilde, \"We and the Americans have much in common but there is always the language barrier.\" Quipped GeorgeBernard Shaw, \"England and America are two countries separated by the samelanguage.\" Hundreds of words and expressions meaning the same thing but differingin form can be listed.For example, British say carriage\".Jefferson, Webster, etc. did not, or could not, foresee the technological ad-vances which characterize the twentieth century and which serve to draw Englishspeaking peoples closer together, though their versions of the language differ. Astime passes, history seems not only to be drawing various dialects of Englishcloser together, but also to be preparing the English latguage for the role ofacknowledged international language.The whole concept of an international language has intrigued man since hefirst had to deal with speakers of a language he did r )t recognize. The alphabet,which the Phoenicians borrowed from the Hebrews and Egyptians and spreadthroughout the world, was plastic enough to be adapted by many languages, re-quiring no coming together Of word meanings. It could be used from right to left orleft to right, up and down, or down and up. It didn't demand exclusive use. (Eventoday, the same language can be represented in different alphabets. Arabic inMalta uses the Roman alphabet, in North Africa, the Arabic alphabet symbolizesthe same language in print.)Through the ages traders and explorers developed various languae francaelsimple hybrid languages limited to business terms and basic needs, like pfaginEnglish, but none of these ever became adopted by a nation. From the days ofRoman influence until the Renaissance and its interest in national languages, Latinserved as an international tongue, Its use was limited after the Empire collapsed in the West to the educated who comprised only a small fraction of the population.In the seventeenth century, the French essayist and philosopher, Rene Des-cattes, concerned with the difficulties, misconceptions, and misunderstandingscaused by ever-increasing proliferation of language differences, proposed theidea of an international, world-wide language. His idea was ignored in his ownday, a period of chauvinism. As the nineteenth century drew to a close, linguists,influenced by the work comparative linguists had accomplished in defining the 122129 existence of an Indo-European parent language, began to create international lang-uages and to promote them to a more interested world.Johann Martin Schleyer, a German priest, developed around 1880, the firstwidely used international language. It was called Volapuk.The word Volapuk itselfmeans \"world-speak\" in that language. Schleyer got some of his inspiration fromone of the widest spread linguae francae, a Mediterranean commercial tongue madeof Italian, French, Greek, Spanish and Arabic. In 1885 Schleyer's book, also calledVolapuk, was published.Both book and language enjoyed great popularity. Volapuksocieties were founded and an 1899 survey listed two hundred thousari speakers inEurope and the United States. Despite its initial popularity and succass, Volapuk died out rather rapidly after the turn of the century. There were many reasons.Because Schleyer wanted much more than a simple lingua franca, his vocabulary,which drew on German, Latin, Greek, English and all the Romance languages con-tained many difficult words. The grammar which he invented was extremely com- plicated. Then too, the violent nationalism which was to explode into World War Iwas already on the rise, an-i the cause for a universal Tanguage is never successfullyadvanced when national feelings run high.A much more successful international language is Esperanto, devisedby Zamenhof, a that language means \"hopeful\", in 1887. It is based on the roots of modernEuropean languages.Esperanto uses the Roman alphabet with the exceptions to English's twenty-six letters. Slow gettingstarted, Esperanto came to the fore after World War L Interest In the League ofNations prompted interest once again in a common language. Esperanto's cause waschampioned by George Bernard Shaw among others. Today Esperanto flourishes.The Esperanto Society's offices in New York City estimate that eight million peoplecan use Esperanto with facility. The Society is campaigning for United Nations' sponsorship of Esperanto throughout the world. Whether it will die out as Volapukdid, or thrive in the future is a matter of conjecture.In 1951 the first dictionary of a language called Interlingua appeared. Moreof a medical-scientific lingua franca than a full-blooded language, Interlingua isdesigned to be used in technical reports and medical and scientific papers whichexpect international circulation. Like Esperanto, Interlingua is based on roots frommodern European languages, and New York City has an Interlingua Society whichspreads information and campaigns for the use of Interlingua among professionals.Some form of international language is desperately needed. Today there areone hundred and fifty languages, which have over a million speakers each.Of thesehundred and fifty, thirteen boast more than fifty million native speakers. Thethirteen are:1.Chinese (Mandarin)2.English 123 130 3.Hindi-Urdu (Hindustani)4.Spanish5.German6.Russian7.French8.Indonesian- Malay9.Bengali10.Portuguese11.Arabic12.Japanese13.ItalianMost of the world's children learn to speak one of these languages as theirmother tongue.With the world continually being drawn ever closer together by technologyand the mass media, how long can such language differences survive? There areserious problems posed by sponsoring an artificial universal language like Esper-anto, and there are objections to establishing one native language above all othersin such an international position of honor, but one or the other seems inevitable.Centuries ago Descartes pointed out that most of the world's problems originate incommunication difficulties caused by such a great profusion of national tongues.Can a world that has watched men walk on the moon much longer afford the luxuryof a plethora of native languages which seriously hinder international untierstarling? 124121. THE SENTENCE AND ITS PARTS1.Check grammar requirements for grades 6,7, and 8. Use a diagnostic test to determine students' proficiency. Reviewonly what is necessary. 2,Clauses - Introduce clausea.as objectc.as an adjective(3)as an adverbd.Introduce infinitive phrases PROPAGANDA OBJECTIVES:The student will understand the meaning and the purpose of propaganda.The student will discover some techniques of propaganda.The student will continue to develop a more rationally critical attitudetoward what he hears, reads, and sees. Background:Propaganda may be described as a \"selling tool.\" Whether his concern isa political idea, a consumer product, or a personal image, the propagandist willappeal to the emotions in his attempt to persuade. Since propaganda can exist in every method of communication, the student must learn to be wary and to developthe habit of judging messages rationally. 125 Although the ninth grade student cannot be expected to absorb all the prin-ciples of logic or to analyze critically the propaganda beyond his experience, heshould be aware of the more obvious propaganda devices:1.Name calling2.Glittering generalities3.The hasty generalization4.Testimonials5.The limiting of choices6.Association7.Identification8.Band WagonNote: Teachers should not attempt to cover all these techniques inone unit, but should spread discussions of the various devicesover the year. 1.Name calling: When the propagandist indulges in name calling,he uses derogatory or insulting language in order to denouncea particular person or cause. Name calling is strictly nega-tive in its appeal to the fears and prejudices of people.2.Glittering generalities. \"Name calling\" appeals to the nega-tive attitudes, and the glittering generalities appeal to thepositive or idealistic attitudes. Whereas the name callerwill employ words which he Ithows will stimulate fear andhatred, the propagandist who uses the glittering generalitiesrealizes that their word choice will appeal to hisaudience's sense of love, patriotism, justice, courage, etc.This positive approach never employs ..pecific terms and doesnot bother to define the abstract or general. Terms such as:\"truth,\" \"freedom \" \"honor,\" \"patriotism\" dominate hasty generalization fits man'sen ency to s mp ify everything. How often does a person attempt to settle an argument with a well-chosen proverb orslogan: \"You can't change alwaysbe with us. \"; \"The poor will always be with us. \"; To err ishuman.\".The testimonial: The testimonial has been treated ac somelength in the grade six unit on logic and advertising. Thestudent should be constantly reminded to evaluate the cem-petency of the so-called authority. 12613a,. 5.The limiting of choices: \"Give me liberty or give me death.\"These words sa-Patrick Henry are perhaps the most famousexample of this logical fallacy and propaganda device. Whenpresented with such \"either-or\" situations, the student shouldexamine the matter carefully and decide whether there arereally only two alternatives.6.Association: Association is a device by means of which thepropagandist tries to establish a connection between the ideahe presents and some object, person, cause, or idea whichpeople respect and cherish or which they may hate and fear.(The grade seven unit on connotative and denotative meanings.should be extremely helpful in teaching this propaganda device.)Students should realize that different groups of people, de-pending upon their backgrounds and experiences, associatedifferent emotional meanings to words and phrases. Theterms \"Hitler\" and \"Nazi\", for example, will elicit a veryspecial reaction from the Jewish community than from others;the term \"ghetto\" will have different emotional impacts uponthe slum dweller and the suburbanite.7.Identification: This device is always used to inspire trust.The propagandist, in trying to sell himself to a particularaudience, tries to become one of them. The Presidential candidate who claims to be \"just an ordinary guy\" is usingthis technique; the candidate who kisses babies and standsoutside factory gates is hoping that his audience will thinkof him as part of its group.8.Band Wagon: This device was also treated in the grade sixtuirtOn logic and advertising. The student should be wary of any appeal that is calculated to make him \"follow the crowd\",Suggested Classroom Activities1.Students should carefully read newspaper and magazine accountswhich deal with public or popular personalities and attempt to findexamples of name calling and glittering generalities. Group work might resutt in better work.2.Students should examine various proverbs and slogans to determineif they are truly universal in nature. How can they zeconcile, forexample, \"Haste makes waste: and the fact that the fastest piece-worker makes the most money?3.A group of students might conduct their own propaganda campaignto a1t'r a dress code, elect a class president, etc. The rest of the class will act as the audience and will be encouraged to analyze thelogic of the campaign. 127 .134.: 4.If it happens to be an election year, the students should follow veryclosely the words and actions of the candidates to determine whatpropaganda devices are employed in the political campaign. 128 1THE STUDY OF LANGUAGE...

Paradox- ically enough, neither the Angles nor the Saxons have as yet ar-rived in England.The Roman Empire in the West collapses.

'. The GREAT VOWEL SHIFT takes place in the English language.Europe's other languages do not undergo it, This movement in English accounts for the frequently bizarre opellings of Englishwords. At this time, short vowels took on long vowel sounds,long vowels became diphthongs, the schwa vowel (e on the end ofname) lost most of its pronunciation but was kept to illustrate thedifference between pin and pine etc. This differentiates English from all other Latins alphabet writing systems; Spanish, German,Italian, etc.Johannes Gutenberg, a German aristocrat, invents the printingpress in Mainz.

When doing any written ,o,k. he shouldhave his dictionary on his desk for free consultation.2.All teachers, not just the English teacher, should ein )liasize the needfor accurate spelling.3.A programmed spelling activity, such as the SRA spelling wheels, shouldbe employed as a means of correcting each student's particular weaknesses.4.Word Power, or vocabulary growth, should be stressed Words should hetaken from student's reading in all classes. As the word becomes part ofthe student's vocabulary, at the same time he masters the of it. 143 IISTENING SKILLSC! One of the most important skills needed in today's world is the ability to listen.Communication today depends more on listening and speaking than on writing. Radioand televist m have had a tremendous influence, so that the student of today requireslistening skills almost as much as reading skills. Most teachers will agree that in many classrooms, well-disciplined student are sitting quietly apparently listening tothe teacher. These young people may give the appearance of attention, but in reality,there exists a passive state. In many cases the students are all but oblivious to the teacher, and completely unaware of what the teacher is saying. Perhaps these stu- dents have encountered too many times the teacher who gives directions once, twice,and maybe even a third time. Who needs to listen to the same thing over and over ?In the attempt to teach the pupil to listen actively, Step one must be to urge theteacher to give directions slowly and clearly once, and once only. The student willnot take long to learn the need for concentration immediately. Step two also involvesthe teacher. Everyone tends to listen more attentively to something that interestshim. L the teacher is aware o a lack of attention on the student's part, it might bewise for the teacher to choose his material more carefully. The class may not beready for a particular story, excellent though it may be.If the teacher of English is definitely committed to he'ping his students acquiregood listening skills, he can plan a definite program to accomplish this aim. He willteach his pupils to concentrate on tie subject he is going to read to them, as soon ashe reads the title.Immediate concentration means that the students start to thinkimmediately. Thinking suggests that questions come into their minds. As the stu-oent listens, he will be seeking answers to his questions. As the listening sessik nreaches Rs conclusion, the pupil will recall or review what he has heard. Such re-call may be done orally, by writing one sentence, or by answering short questionsi-ut the material.Acquiring skill in listening caruot be accomplished in one step. Frequent prac-tice is needed. The SRA reading laboratory provides excellent material toward thisaim. Utilization of T.Q. L.R. formula as presented by SRA is perhaps one of t bestways to teach students to listen.Finally, the cooperation of teachers of other disciplines must be sought. Lis- tening skills, just like spelling, punctuation, etc. must not be confined to the Englishclass. With the help of all teachers, the goal of intelligent, active, skillful listeningcan be met.See Composition section for detailed information on teaching listening skills. 150144 GRADE VI -IX LITERATURE \"The study of literature must remain at the heart of th.-: Englishcurriczilum in the secondary schools, for it is only through a literature-cantered program that the course of English retains its identity as ahumanistic euperience. Dwight L. Burton '151145 OVERVIEW An understanding and appreciation of great literature forms a very vital part ofthe cultural tradition of American society. From literature of the past and from thewritings of today, a mutual understanding among races and religions, a love of free-dom, and an appreciation of the value of the individual and society evolve. Literature gives the student vicariously, the experiences of all people, all over the world, fromall time.Literature helps the child to think, to understand life, and to place trueworth on moral values. Beyond all these factors, literature serves to stir the emo-tions.The curriculum presented in the following pages includes a wide range of mate-rials, from the classics to the current. The reading requirements may be modifiedwithin a school when, in the reasoned judgment of many teachers, not just one teach-er, modification is desirable or necessary.No teacher should use the books of the next year, but he may certainly substi-tute any selection listed for a lower grade, but as yet untaught. Such proceduremakes the keeping of a permanent record of literature used in each grade mandatory. 152146 IJLITEFtATURE VI - IX GENERAL OBJECTIVES:The student will:meet material chosen to stimulate his imagination and broadenhis intellectual horizon.develop an understanding of his literary heritage.become acquainted with a sampling of the best of contemporaryliterature.gain insights into our times and into personal and social problems.have desirable moral values reinforced.explore many types of writing.develop standards for critical evaluation of literature.discover the groat possibilities literature has for recreation.broaden his background with hopes of improving his writing skilland talents.develop an understanding that the literature of an era accuratelyreflects that era,be encouraged to delve into literature on his own during the schoolyears and be so gratified by this exploration that he will wish tocontinue experiencing literature throughout his life. 153147 SUGGESTED TECILNIQU:1S FOR TEACHING LITERATURE VI - IX Competent teachers 4re familiar with a variety of methods for teaching litera-ture.Essential factors are enthusiasm on the pare of the teacher, a broad back-ground in literature, especially books for young people, and a firm belief that everyliterature lesson can bt.: a pleasurable and purposeful experience. The literaturelesson begins with an introduction. The introduction aims to arouse '.-he student'sinterest, give him the background necessary for complete understanding, remove thedifficulties in his path (word meaning, for example) and provide foam when necessary,e.g., character, plot, theme, etc. The body of the lesson ii.dudes reading and dis-cussion.The conclusion of the lesson is composed of a summation, the student's re-action, assignment, or perhaps evaluation, and the student's re-statement of thetheme.Many times the same piece of literature should be studied and discussed by theentire class as a unit.For slower students or poor readers, the teacher may find itprofitable to do much of the reading himself. Lack of student reading ability should not preclude the enjoyment of literature.When the teacher wishes to gi-re opportunity to supplement the reading, or pro-vide for individual tastes and abilities, directed and guided individual reading plays apart.Individual reading by the pupils requires much from the teacher. He mustknow the pupil and also the available material. He must motivate the pupil, arousehis interest or curiosity, give him time to do the'reading, and be available to offerassistance when it is needed. When students in a class do individual reading, theteacher must provide opportunity and means for the students tc share their knowledgewith other classmates.Finally, the teacher must vary his plans and methoeN for the type class he isdealing with. Younger students or poorer readers make greater gains from shortreadings of varied types. The udvanced student is expected to do more in-depth studyof any book read.The creative teacher will be constantly adapting the material listed in the fol-lowing guide, and frequently developing interesting activities to supplement the read-ings and discussions.For example, to assist teachers, a suggested list of enrich-ment activities follows each genre shidik:u in grade nine; with modifications these ac-tivities may well be adopted for use in the other middle grades. 154148 LITERATUREGRADE VI 155.149 OBJECTIVES:In the sixth grade, for the first time, the student will begin to treat litera-ture as literature. The student will:read literature for its sheer beauty.focus his attention on :literature's economy and precision in lang-uage.develop the theme in the story so as to see its universal ideas.see the applicability of these universal ideas.begin to use the basic tools of literary study: comparison andcontrast.maintain, refine, extend and use the rich background of litera-ture provided in the earlier grades.enjoy a variety of vicarious experiences.begin to understand himself through an understanding of others.through his explorations in literature, foster:1.love and understanding of the ideas and ideals of ourAmerican heritage.2.deep respect for the ideas and ideals of other peoples.3.a sense of spiritual values.cultivate the skill of good listening. 156' 151 LITERATUREUnit ITales from Many LandsMinimum Required: 5 stories and BA.Bible stories\"The Tower of Babel\" (required)\"Abraham's Sacrifice\"\"The Story of Lot\"'The Finding of the Child Moses\"\"The Escape Across the Red Sea\"\"The Golden Calf\"\"The Conversion of Ruth\"\"David and Goliath\"\"The Story of Job\"\"The Story of Esther\"\"Daniel in the Lion's Den\"\"The Sermon on the Mount\"\"The Parable the Good Samaritan\"\"The of the Lost Sheep\"\"The Parable of the Prodigal Son\"\"The Good Shepherd\".Fables\"Androcles and the and the Crane\"\"The Pendulum\"\"Education of a Lion\" ,\"The Hare and the Tortoise\"!'The Lion and the Mouse\"\"The Town Mouse and the Country Mouse\"Selections chosen from Aesop's FablesC.Folklore and fairy talesRequired: 5 selections from books C (Outside Reading)Arabian Nights LandAfrican sampeon HarmonTWrwiffMTWiirior Serraillierboa c Negro BontempsA Vavalk, de of Witches Hope-SimpsoniTvcrr STairy Tales Told in by HavilandaiTtia Fairy Book LangGrimm's Fairylitlel L Olcott Editwn 152 How the Mouse Deer Became King (Indonesian) BroKing Who Rides a Tiger NeiTana tale) HitchcockSerendipity Tales (Persian) ) HodgesStone of Victory (Irish) ColumTricky Peik (folklore from many lands) Ed.

Let the students try to guess national origins of the proper names. This should add some interest.List several definitions of myths or as many elements as thestudents can come up with. As the stories are developed, the studentscan and should add or subtract from these elements. Students will probably be led to retell the story of Pandora since many students shouldhe familiar with it from their own experiences. If no student is familiar with the Pandora myth, the teacher can read it to the class orshow one of the several filmstrips which have been done on this myth.Students will also volunteer the Biblical account of the creation. This is to be encouraged for purposes of character delineation and treatment ofthe theme. Discussion should be reserved until the students have readat least one more story of creation for comparison and contrast.7.ProcedureNow, the teacher may consider several methods of attack, choosingone which he finds most suitable to student study habits, reading abilities,or the teacher's individual style. What is essential is not the order in which the stories are read, or whether summary questions are answeredorally or on paper, but that the summary questions are basically thesame for each of the stories and that the stories are continually relatedto each other.ClassworkA.Students read \"Kintu and the Law of Love\". After the story is completed, they are to answer the following summary questions:1.Who is Kintu?2.Can he be likened to anyon' else whom you have met before?How?3.Is Kintu a creator or a creature? 160 4.Is he like any creatoi or creature you have met before? 5.Why does Kintu leave?6,Do you know of anyone else who has done something like him?7.What makes Kintu come back?8.Is there anything god-like about Kintu?9.How is Kintu do takes place? Why?B.Home AssignmentStudents read \"Blackfoot Genesis\" and answer the following questions:1.Who is Old Man?2.Is he like anyone you have met before?3.Whom does he create first? From what?4.How is he like Kintu? Anyone else?5.What is the reason for sleep?6.How is the reason for sleep like the reason for Kintu'sdeparture?7.List some god-like traits of Old Man.8.Lifi. some human traits of Old Man.9.Where do you think this story takes place? Why?C.Classwork for day 2 or 3Students read \"Tree With Animal Fruit\", and make up a series ofquestions similar to those given for \"Kintu\" and \"Blackfoot Genesis\".The questions will be answered individually or through class discussion.Later the students again refer to those elements of a myth recorded inthe Introduction and the students show.d come up with a reasonablefiefinition of N.-Nat a myth is.D.Review, Reinforcement, Enrichment, Integration 1.Have the students write their own myth. For example, from motion pictures, the student may be familiar with the nomadic life of the 170 Bedouin. The students will see the importance of sheep and goatsin providing sustenance through meat and milk, shelter through theskins and wool of the animals, implements from bone and horn,beauty in the rugs woven by the nomads from the wool of theiranimals.The student might then be asked to write a myth on,How the Oases Came To Be Sprinkled Across the Desert. The student could also explain in the form of the myth the origin of\"Puddingstone in Roxbury\" (cf. \"The Roxbury Giant\") or theorigin cf Noodle's Island (East. Boston) or other prominent land-marks of local geography.2.Observe creation in the scientific-literary sense in tha openingparagraphs of Michener's Hawaii. (Volcanic slides would be greathere.)3.In art class, illustrate one of the myths.4.Make a mural or collage representing one or more of the myths ofcreation.5.Make ceramic or clay statues of key figures in the creation myths.6.Using a different myth, show how it too reflects Geography or otherelements of the myth.7.Using colored chalk, put scenery on the blackboard and dramatizethe myth (s).8.Write a class play, perhaps using the group of travellers techniqueHave each traveller tell his people's story of creation while othermembers of the class act it out, Student Enrichment Activities - MythsNote:The number of these activities to be included in the plans will of necessitybe determined by the teacher to meet the needs and abilities of a particula,group of students.It is hoped that the above average student will beencouraged to accomplish a great deal of imaginative, creative work inan independent manner. The slower student should be encouraged topartake of activities which will make his reading more meaningful andwill reinforce his classroom experiences.1.Go on a field trip Fine ArtsPeabody MuseumMrs. Palace names in advertising. Consult theYellow Pages.3.List mythological names in the space program.4.Write a modern myth.5.Dramatize one of the myths.6.Draw cartoons or pictures to illustrate' a myth.7.Draw a map of ancient Greece, Africa, Near East, Tribal America8.Make a crossword puzzle based on mythological terms.9.Explain classical allusions in a short selection of poetry.10.Listen to music r4fiated to myths.11.Write one of the myths as it would appear in a newspaper.12.Make a linoleum print.13.Pain. a mural related to a myth.

UNIT I- PROVERBSProverbs are a distillation of the wisdom of a people. As such they indicatebasic differences between peoples and basic similarities among peoples. One mayfind proverbs which present the same general idea or proverbs which presentdiametrically opposed notions. For these reasons, proverbs are ideal vehicles for comparing and contrasting approaches to a problem, ideas, and values. In addition they often reflect their origins in the images and language they use. During the courseof the year, a minimum of 10 shou .1 be analyzed, so that the proverbs retain theirvalue for comparison and contrast, no fewer than two at a titre should be attempted.Students should be encouraged to introduce additional proverbs from their own storeof knowledge and try to compare and contrast technique with them.\"Education is an ornament in prosperity and a refuge inadversity.\" Greek\"When spiders unite, they can tie up a lion.\" African\"Gentle words open iron gates.\" Bulgarian\"A flatterer is a secret enemy.\" Hungarian\"Never judge a man unti**u have walked for two Americanmoons in his mocca, Indian\"To a friend's house the road is never long.\" Dutch\"Never cast dirt into the fountain of which you havesometime drunk.\" Hebrew\"When the sick man rnovers, he forgets his African\"One dog barks because it sees something; a hundreddogs bark because they heard the first dog bark.\" Chinese\"He got Ingry with the fleas and threw his fur coatinto the oven.\" Russian 173176 \"The dawn does not come twice to wake a man.\" African\"Dirt shows the quickest on the cleanest cotton.\" American Negro\"Who gossips to you will gossip about you.\" Turkish\"When you are trying to catch a bifd, sing to it nicely.\" Czechoslovakian\"Though a monkey wear silk, he is still a monkey.\" Spanish\"There are no people a thousand years old, but there Inner are words a thousand years old.\" Mongolian\"A happy heart is a healing medicine; but a broken Old spirit dries up the bores.\" Testament\"To whom life was heavy, the earth is light.\" Polish\"He who is guilty believes all men speak ill of him.\" Italian\"He who keeps his mouth and his tongue keeps him- Old sell from trouble.\" Teutonic\"Who has lost his freedom has nothing else to lose.\" German\"He who walks daily over his estate finds a coineach time.\" Hebrew\"You Chinese\"If you want a hen's egg you must put up with hercackling.\" English\"Everyone sings as he has the gift, and marriesas he has the luck.\" Portuguese\"Even God cannot make two mountains without avalley between them,\" Gaelic\"The noise of the wheels does not measure the load Americanin the wagon.\" Negro\"A rich peasant, like a shaggy dog, only keeps him-self warm with his money.\" Roumanian\"In prosper;ty no altars smoke.

DrewFamous American 194 i196 GRADE IXLITERATURE 19519 BACKGROUND1.LiteratureThe approach to literature in Grade IX is by genre. The mechanics of the literary type should be stressed. The student should become aware of the differ- ent types of poetry, short story, novel, etc. The student should now be ready to progress from enjoyment to understanding as.d appreciation. Because the ability of the student should be the first consideration, the teacher must insure that instriving to bring understanding and appreciation within the student's grasp the teacherdoes not in fact take away the enjoyment of the literary experience.The student is to be encouraged to write short stories, poetry, drama, etc.In the writing of poetry, the \"jive five\" or \"instant\" or \"formula poetry\" mightaid the student in his first attempts. In creating drama, the individual student, or the class in a cooperative venture, might write the dialogue for a motion picturewhich could be shown with the sound off.In studying literature, ^ne is most often concerned with comparisons andcontrasts.Beyond comparing and contrasting two representative pieces, it mightbe desirable to compare the handling of the same material in different forms (forexample, The Big Wave by Pearl Buck is available in play and short story form.)Literature is the core for the study of English in Grade DC. This curriculum has been des gned to alroiv pie teacher a flexible vehicle for his creativity and in-genuity, promising maximum profit to the student.2.MethodologyRow does the student come to an \"understanding\" and \"appreciation\" ofliterature? This is the problem of education to provide the tools to achieve theeducational goals.The intellectual tools are the questions which the student mustput to the literary work himself. Unless the student addresses the work itself, he can do little more than add to his collection of factual data.What are the questions the student should ask of a literary work? They areexactly those questions the teacher himself asks of it. Because of the intensely personal nature of much that is literature, answers will admit of variatfm, be-cause understanding and appreciation of literature varies. Students should ask the following questions themselves in the process of reading. This list of questions is not intended to be memorized but is intended as a generalapproach on the part of the students.\"Summary outline of the dictionary of questions 1.First View: 2.Second View:What is my first impression of the 'work as atotal unit?Under which literary type would I classify the workfrom a first reading? 19719,8 3.Third View:What is my tentative expression of the theme of the workat this point?4.Fourth View:How in general is the theme developed by the main partsof the work?5.Fifth View:How in particular do the theme and its developinent givemeaning to every part of the work?A.In all works-by feeling and thought, style,figures of speech and poetry-by imagery, meter, rhyme?C.In narratives-by setting, plot, television plays-by pageantry,camera editing?6.Sixth View:How is the theme further clarified by knowledge of elementsoatside the work itself, such as the author's life and times?7.Seventh View:What is my final evaluation of the work? How does thework clarify, support, or contradict my own concept ofwhat the \"Good Life\" is?\"Reprinted by permission of the L. W.

Requirements for the EpicAll students will be exposed to an excerpt from three Epics in List 1 andthree additional excerpts from Lists 1 and 2 combined. Selections are to be chosento show \"some notable action or series of actions carried out under heroic or super- natural guidance\".Attention should be focused on the clear delineation of good orevil, rather than on whether the history narrated is real or fictitious.The better student should read at least four more selections from the lists orone book fronreilina the end of this section. 216 All students should be able to identify the following:The IliadThe OdysseyOdysseus .AchillesHelen of TroyKing ArthurBeowulfThe better student should also be able to identify:SiegfriedRolandCharlemagneGawaineHomerThe number of further selections should be limited only by the students'interest and abilities.List 1 List 2The Iliad Beowulf .The emagneKin Gloosprs Country and OtherIndian Wa Hamilton ikon Haugaardeeroes t,.; Kingsley Reroes and Monsters of 9utcliff.,..iHuon of the Horn I:.,..iNorton 217218 The Mad of Homer Picard Judith of France Ong TrIaTiT(Agamemnon) Coolidge The LegenForiEe Cid Robin Hood PyleThegea great Men anmen o Ear y Bible Do DeJongHamilton the Norseman Green amesake (Alfred the Great) HodgesThe Odyssey of Homer PicardTheWay Hamilton The Siege and Pall of Troy.

For example, instead of resisting, the Trojans respond to pressure and promise to return Helenof Troy.6.Using the story as background material, make it a departure point forwriting or class discussion. For example, the student imagines himselfto be Moses just after he has smashed the tablets on which were writtenthe Ten Commandments. He has forgotten what the Commandi .entswere.

Background:Choral speaking is group interpretation, orally, of suitable literature, litera-ture which, by its very form and content, practically demands group expression toconvey the true meaning.In the expression of group emotion or universal thought,the group of voices is superior to the individual voice, because of the greater var-ieties in tone, pitch, and volume which can be developed in a group.For the earliest use of choral sxaking chronicled in history one must retraceMs steps to ancient Greece where the speaking chorus was used in the drama as earlyas 500 B. C. to create atmosphere. The ancient Hebrews recited the 7.1salms in groups.Choral speaking played a part in the recitation of the ballad in the medieval manorhall. The minstrel recited the ballad; the listeners joined in at interval3 with arefrain.In primitive America, the chants of the early American Indian were a formof Choral Speaking. Choral Speaking, as it is known today dates from a period shortlyafter the close of World War I. Vachel Lindsay in the United States served to pop- ularize a form of choral speaking when he directed groups to join him. 221221 There are several choral speaking arrangements:Solo-refrainAntiphonalSmall groupSequentialCumulativeUnison44,44-4TIt.4 The poem itself will decide which method will be used.

CMMI.MONum um ARBITRARY GRADE DIVISIONS IN COMPOSITIONThe exigencies and realities of presenting a composition course to studentsof different grades raises a problem of dividing a logically indivisible matter.Since one's skill in writing is never perfected, the process of its acquisition beingcontinuous and never-ending, to divide such a process into arbitrary segments be-comes self-defeating.The problem of individual and group differences is crucial.Many sixth-grade students are capable of producing far more sophisticated writingthan some ninth-grade students. A course of study arbitrarily and rigidly divided may, on the one hand, deprive the ninth-grader who for some reason cannot write,of the necessary development of his sensory perception; and may, on the otherhand, limit the sixth-grader to a level well below his ability. In either case, apotentially good writer may lose interest and give up.One solution may be found in emphasis. While the activities of any part of the composition course of study should be available t,.) any student from grade sixto nine, the general emphasis in grade six should be upon the acquisition of ideas,in grade seven upon description, in grade eight upon narrative, and in grade nineupon eleme:itary persuasion and style. Although this divisio:! is also arbitrary and one uculd be hard put to justify the separations on the basis of any intrinsicdistinctions, there is evidence to suggest that the student, and especially thereluctant student, requires greater stimulation in the beginningand that stimulationincreases in proportion as the student approaches direct apprehension of objectsand events.It should be pointed out, incidentally, that the majority of reputable authorsof composition texts base their grade divisions upon grammar and usage. Theynave obviously despaired of any attempt, even to satisfy the demands of gradelevels, to find natural afisions inherent in the study of composition. 227229 RATIONALE FOR COMPOSITION STUDYDespite the almost unanimous attempt to integrate composition into theEnglish curriculum and make it a subsidiary, so to speak, it should beclearly understood that composition is an autonomous discipline of intrinsicvalue per se.Jt is admittedly essential to the proper study of literature,language, And many other disciplines, but should nevertheless be consideredan independent entity.It is also a widespread assumption that composition and grammarare inseparable and should aid and abet each other. The teacher teachesthe principles of grammar as a structure for composition and then goes ona witchhunt through the ill-conceived compositions searching for grammaticalerrors and cases of incorrect usage. We submit that this whole premiseis unsound.Research has persistently pointed out that the two fields have verylittle correlation with each other. English teachers have long been aware of the fact that the study of grammar makes no appreciable improvement inthe process of writing. What they have been slow in accepting is theunderstanding that this is a perfectly natural conclusion. Just as composition is an autonomous discipline, so is the study of language.Children study grammar to better understand the structure of theirlanguage; they study composition so that they will express themselvesmore effectively. And never or hardly ever shall the twain meet.THE SCOPE OF COMPOSITIONThe aims of composition as delineated in most curriculum guidespresent a most impressive and imposing array of skills. Practically every teacher of experience knows that it is manifestly impossible toteach what one is usually expected to teach, but this great expectation isfrequently justified by the premise that some children somewhere will beable to accomplish these worthy and lofty objectives that have been laidout for them. Certainly a more logical and realist,c: approach must betaken to prevent the frustration of all the future generations of teachersand students.To get down to cases, the middle school should concentrate nndescription, narration, and elementary persuasion. Exposition, if taught at all, should be limited to the ninth grade and even then undertakenwith the most careful restraint. This would seem to be a negative way to res-pond to the many claims that today's otudent cannot plan, organize, thinklogically, or display coherence, unity, and emphasis in his written work,but perhaps it is a more negative approach to ask him to do things that heis patently unqualified to do. This is not to imply that descriptive andnarrative writing do not require these qualities for they certainly do, butthey do not require skills of the high order called for in expository writing. 2S0228, Expository writing is certainly necessary for businessmen,lawyers, engineers, architect! and other professional people, but there is a sensitive child, hordes of them in fact, who will never enter theprofessions, who need an education, too. For them creative writing of the kind provided by description and narration will fulfill an outstanding need.There is no intention to make them professional writers, but rather tomake them more sensitive human beings, which perhaps is the ultimategoal of all educational endeavors.Since zrach one of the forms of discourse has qualities appropriate to it,rigorous (raining must be provided in each type. There is a kind of order appropriate to narration, another kind appropriate to description. TheexposiOry order, so often taught, is appropriate to neither. There are arts orskills peculiar to narration and there are others peculiar to description.The spatial sequence of description is quite dissimilar to the temporalorder of narration.For descriptive writing the most exacting training inobservation is absolutely requisite along with the increasing of the sensorypowers. The student of the middle school, who is still responding freshlyto the environment around him, should be taught to interpret himself andthe world about him in story, verse, and essay. This training should beinductive, always working from the student's writing to the principles ofwriting.Students should become proficient in knowing and expressing theirown feelings and thoughts. Such self-knowledge , itself, is an importanteducational goal.They should have the opportunity to secure an audience,to recognize the validity of their ideas, to be understood and accepted,and to achieve a measure of social discipline. They should learn to accept positive criticism and not be continually burdened with the fear that theirfeelings and thoughts will be judged harshly, censured, or consideredunacceptable. They should learn to accept the teacher's alternatives and notregard them as a threat to their own creativity.If it is accepted, then, that description, narration, and persuasionshould be taught in the middle school, we must, logically, teach the skillsappropriate to each.But these forms of discourse must not be keptseparate for very long.Description must inevitably enter the area ofnarration, and both may profitably enter the area of persuasion. This suggests that description should come first, followed by narration, thenby persuasion, and finally by a strictly limited form of exposition.This is a difficult task, but we must make every effort to relate the forms ofdiscourse to one another if we are to finish with anything resembling unifiedcomposition.COMPONENTS OF ALL WRITINGAll writing requires (1) the selection of material (2) an order or shapingform, and (3) appropriate expression. No assignment can ignore any of thesethree parts. Each of them must be seen in context. In particular, order orform should not be taught in isolation but in close relation to the aims of a 251229:; designated assignment.It should be understood, too, that there is no absoluteorder valuable, per se, just as there is no style appropriate to all kinds ofwriting, but there is an order which is logical or natural to each form ofwriting.Students should be encouraged to choose their own forms and materials.Their choices will depend entirely on their own feelings and thoughts.Perhaps the most important choice they will make will be in finding atopic and in limiting it to what they can reasonably handle. Where do theybegin? Most opportunely they should have started their preparations forwriting at birth.But in case their eyes haven't been opened to the wonderfulworld about them, the teacher should assume this as his first priority-- totrain them to see, to hear, to smell, to feel, to taste--because out of thissolid content alone can come rich and effective writing.The world of people should be their next concern and by coservingtheir friends, teachers, and parents, they can developa perceptiveness tothe actions of men.They can find much appealing material by holdiag the mirror tothemselves:interesting introspection, emotional experiences, andautobiographical happenings.And finally, students can utilize the visual arts, music, magazines,proverbs, newspaper headlines, cartoons, speeches on tape, and some ofthe many other devices mentioned in this curriculum guide.CONCLUSIONAll writing should be taught as a discipline. It is a disservice to the student to let Mm write with no direction or restraining hand on how he writes.It is the teacher's function to establish a classroom climate wherein thetools of writing are respected in the development of their use. In short , writing should not be permissive.There must be careful teaching, many models for emulation, and ofcourse, restrainz of one kind or another. The student must learn to observe accurately, to record his observations freely and with style, and togive full vent to his imagination, but he must also become accustomed toimposing form and mechanics on his creations, so that the reader's job willnot be unduly difficult.He must write enough prose so that he develops a senseof ease and proficiency in its use. He must learn freedom in what he writes and discipline in how he writes.That writing can promote such a significant educational goal asself-knowledge should give it an important place in the English curriculum. Thestudent who can write well can manage his Own education. Through theemulation of great writing ne will be led to artistic and intellectual excellence.He will not simply be led to the collection of facts and their arrangement, butto discipline and power.He will be led to the development of himself as an 232230 individual. He will haye taken the first step_on the road to being the _uniquely humanbeing without which our society cannot survive. 231293,1t,.PJ.r., GENERAL OBJECTIVESThe student will:become sensitive to the world about him through increasing pro-ficiency in observation and he will become more aware of thesignificance of his experiences.learn to list observations and ideas in words, phrases, and sen-tences that create sensory images in the reader's mind.become adept at originality of expression and in the improvementof his creative talents as he progresses through the variousfoz 'ns of written expression.learn to explore, to discover, and to express himse:f freely andwith originality in a learning atmosphere conducive to thesequalities.become proficient in the use of the skills of oral and writtencommunication needed in literary forms such as descriptions,narrations, poems, dialogues, letters, and reports.have the opportunity to experience a sense of pleasure, ofsatisfaction, and of accomplishment in his creative wr,ting endea-rors,undertake experiences and activities structured to release positiveemotions and reduce inner tensions.undertake activities in his composition program that will fosterhis social adjustment and growth.

A.THE VISUAL SENSEF4ackgroundOne of the greatest drawbacks to effective student writing is the student'sinability to discover anything worth writing about. Since much of his knowledge of the world and the people about him is acquired through the senses, it would seemto be a quite logical starting point to sharpen his perception and to lead him to makemore accurate and meaningful observations of his environment. Once he has gainedthe knack of keen observation, he should never again be at a loss for something totalk or write about.In his first faltering steps at releasing the creativity withinhimself, the student will undoubtedly make many errors of omission and commission,but the wise teacher will carefully refrain from stemming the wells that are so hardto start.This section is devoted to ways and means of \"loosening\" the student's mindso that he will have something to say about the vibrant and dynamic life swirlingaround him.Suggested Classroom ActivityMaterials:Some possible materials for use in stimulating the visualacuity of the student are:1.reproductions of famous paintings2.photographs taken by the students as well as those obtainedfrom newspapers and magazines3.television shows4.films5.slides6.personal drawings or designs7.objects of particular interest or curiosity. 237235 In this lesson or series of lessons the teacher used a reproduction of \"ThatGentleman\" by Andrew Wyeth, which can be found on page 199 of the OregonCurriculum Series, Literature II. This painting depicts a rather lonely-looking, old man sitting in a chair in a rather simple and severe room. The teacher made a few introductory remarks concerning the importance of observation. He explain- ed to the class that the aim of the lesson was to see how much each student ccrAddobserve in the picture through the use of his visual sense. The manner in which the student was to record his observations was left to his discretion, though itwas pointed out that a few well chosen words were usually more effective than astream of poorly conceived ones. Each child then concentrated his efforts on the painting and recorded his observations. The teacher circulated about the room while this activity was going on providing individual stimulation where it was neededOr general help when it was called for. SAMPLE OBSERVATIONS FROM ONE CLASSold retired manblindold table and see eyes 238J f Some individual students, caught up in the picture, recorded their observations in expanded form and veered off subjectively.\"He seems to be some sort of a shoemaker because of the shoes and the scissors in the background.\"\"This picture seems to show the loneliness of this man.It also show3 that perhaps he has only himself and very few possessions to care for. Loneliness is shown by the drab color with just a little light that sug- gests that perhaps he has the shades pulled so as to black out others.\"\"This man is proud of the few things that he owns. He is neat in his own way.He once may have had a very good job and was accustomed to having things done for him and then he lost all his money in drinking or gambling and then could not help himself.\"\"The man is a loner.He never got involved with other people. It looks as if he is just going to sit in his old rocker and waste away. His mission in life is completed. For him the rest is downhill.\"\"This man is a very proud person. It is December now and he has just put his shoes on the small bureau because he is a very old man and he cannot bend down without suffering pain.\"\"It seems as if this man is lonely. He is just staring off into space sime he has nobody to talk to and nothing to do. He has so much time on his hands.\"\"This gentleman probably feels that since he is old nobody cares about him.And nobody will talk with him or visit him.\"\"The room looks very shabby and dark. There is no light coming through to give it a happy and homey atmosphere.\"\"The man looks as if he doesn't really care what he looks like because he probably rarely sees anyone and therefore there is no reason to fix the room up or wear fancy clothes,\"It is obvious from the samples that much of the children's observation will be starkly objective while some will be subjective in varying degrees. The teacher's job will differ from child to child, Some students will have to be encouraged to enrich their observationTOWiers will have to be reminded that the purpose of these early lessons is merely to observe what is actually represented.In the first attempts the responses of the students may be few in number and slow in coming, so that the teacher may have to direct their attention to particular areas of the painting and to gently prod and elicit observations through skillfulquestioning.Eventually children will take to this game of observation withenthusiasm and increasing skill, thus paving the way for future success in compo- sition. 23923r/ In further activities of this nature the teacher can not only help the child tosharpen his powers of observation, but he can also lead the child to see that arich vocabulary is essential to express the testimony of the senses accurately.Many, many sessions of this kind, using a wide variety of visual material, will benecessary before the students are ready to proceed to the shaping of their observa-tions into descriptive and narrative writing B.THE AUDITORY SENSEBackgroundAlthough the possibilities for auditory stumulation are somewhat more limitedthan those for visual activities, the immediate environment is full of unperceivedsounds.Some possible materials for use in stimulating the auditory acuity ofthe students are:I.records of music, classical, jazz, popular, folk2.records of sound effects3.tapes and tape recorder and4.objects used by class to create own sounds.Suggested Classroom ActivityAn excellent, if obvious, approach to auditory stimuli is the playing ofmusical recordings.From a variety of almost infinite possibilities, the teacherchose two recordings: a sixteenth-century motet by Orlando di Las,,o, and a modern(not commercial) jazz piano thorus. This, of course, is less an exerchie observation (as is the visual), than a direct approach to the source of emotions.As might be expected, therefore, the responses tend to be abstract, personal,dream-fantasy, stream-of-consciousness, etc.The important point of this lesson is that a completely uninhibited recordingof emotional flow by the student should be expected and accepted. Form, the shaping of this chaotic matter, should be imposed later, diplomatic care being takenby the teacher not to destroy the student's spontaneity and enthusiasm.RECORD ONE - SAMPLE OBSERVATIONS FROM ONE CLASS\"This seems to be some kind of church music. It makes you think of maybe pretty people in a pretty place such as a garden or maybe even Heaven.\"\"It sounds like a ceremony for someone who has died. It sounds sad.Every- one is quiet and sad.It could be in church or outside at the cemetery. It could be someone remembering someone at a ceremony. There was singing there.\" 240238' \"People in a beautiful big building all of different races, colors, and creeds.Even though the words of the song mean a different thing but all oZ them aretogether singing.\"\"Different people with different thoughts and interests. Trying to balance themselves on top of the earth and not succeeding.\"RECORD TWO - SAMPLE OBSERVATIONS\"Seems happy.A lot of people in a night club being happy. Pretty girls and their boy Mends sitting around drinking, smoking, talking, laughing.\"\"I see a lot of colors, all mixed. Red.Yellow.Blue and green,Like anabstzact painting.MI in shapes that don't look like anything real. Now it seems brown with little blue shapes like triangles.\"\"Somebody's got a radio on at the beach. Maybe on a blanket, eating apicnic lunch.Sand and salt water. Maybe at the amusement park.Spinning and falling amusements.\"The teacher's main problem here is to restrain himself from correctingobvious examples of inferior writing, dull, lifeless vocabulary, sentence. fragments,etc.Such corrections must be imposed later.Another possible activity is to have two or three students leave the room and,after all members of the class have covered their eyes, return to perform so..nepredetermined actions involving sound. One could crumple and tear paper, another could drop metallic or wooden objects on the floor, while a third couldmake vo^al sounds.The other students, whose eyes have been covered duringall this, should write their versions of what took place, describing the sounds inthe order of their performance.This kind of activity should be performed many times with many variations.As students become more proficient in hearing what takes place, they should, as invisual perception, come to realize the importance of skillful listening and the neces-sii.y of accurate communication.In another lesson involving auditory perception, the members of the class wereinstructed to close their eyes and listen intently to all the sounds around them. Aftera few minutes they wrote down everything they heard. 241230* .....=ralSAMPLE OBSERVATIONSauto horn as over the schoola door slamsa sneeze next door followed by laughtera desk squeaks as someone uses an eraserthe roar of power mower C. THT.: TACTILE SENSESuggested Classroom ActivitiesA number of objects with various textures may be handed to blindfoldedmembers of the class; ' sandpaper, stainless steel, marbles, coral, leather,rubber, plastic, tennis ball, a pineapple, velvet, nylon, wool, smooth wood,rough wood, etc.After examining there previously numbered articleb by means of touch only,the students should exchange with their neighbors. After exchanging once or twice, the students should write their obser rations. Again, the chief emphasis should be on observation rather than on form, punctuatn, and grammar.D. THE OLFACTORY AND GUSTATORY SENSESSuggested Classroom ActivitiesChoices for actual classroom demonstrations of smell and taste are morelimited.Chips of fragrant wood like cedar of pine, camphor, perfume, paintthinner, spices, are a few possibilities. Examples of taste aAv, of course, generally limited to what is edible or potable. These smells and tastes, immediately identifiable to nearly everyone, may, in one sense, be dismissed with theirabstract labels, or in another sense be so bowled with connotations that an objectivedescription is impossible.One solution, hov.tver, is for the student to pretend tobe describing these sensations to someone who has never experienced them. Heshould also be aided by the study of specific words like: sharp, bland, pungent,bitter, tingling, acrid, choking, musty, etc. 24224d II. SENSORY IMPRESSIONS FROM MEMORY OBJECTIVEThe student will learn to make observations in an imaginative or recreatedsituation. Back s,The sharpening of sensory perceptions should have an early beginning, an in-tensive middle, but no defined terminus. Although the ultimate in acute observationis an ever-receding goal, the student at some time is ready to move from one nebu-lously defined step to the next.Having spent some time observing and recording facts, the student should rowtry to record facts from memory. Even if the suggested situation has never beenexperienced, the student should be able to synthesise in his imagination what he al-ready knows of the subject.Suggested Classroom Activities1.Student activities might follow this version of a piloted lesson. Studentswere asked to list everything visual they could recall or imagine concern-ing an automobile accident:MIIMshattered glass hunks of chrome crumpled metal flat tire twisted metal man holding cloth to forehead steam rising from radiator woman crying, her shoulders puddle of gasoline shaking The students then listed the sounds that could be heard during and after theaccident: screech of brakes hiss of escaping steam bang and crunch of colliding moment of silencegrinding of metal whirr of a spinning wheel shattering of glass woman crying clank of chrome parts on street.and the odors: 243241: gasoline fumesburned rubbersteamsettling dust Many more lessons of this kind may profitably be employed before the studentis led to more formal writing.2.Another source of raw material from which to shape composition is thestudent's own thoughts and feelings. One possible method of inducingan introspective flow is for the student to spend ten or fifteen minuteswriting down every memory that enters his mind. That these memoriesmay be highly personal, totally unrelated, and expressed poorly makesno difference. The important point is that he write spontaneously andquickly.If he has difficulty getting started, he may be stimulated by anobject, sound, etc.This draft should be retained in the student's jour-nal for later revision. 242244 III. ORGANIZATION OF IDEAS OBJECTIVEThe student will learn to impose form on his ideas in both prose and poetry. BackgroundFrom a recording of mere words or phrases, the student should now try toweave these words and phrases into some kind of narrative or description. Fe shouldfeel completely free in his comoosition; that is, Hs spontaneity should not be inhibi-ted by a constant fear that his every mistake in punctuation, his poorly-chosen words,or his misspellings will be ruthlessly bluepenciled.Suggested Classroom ActivityAs in the preceding unit, this following model class activity was successfullypiloted at the first step in imposing form. In this series of lessons, the class studied a semi-abstract painting by Pablo Picasso, The Three Musiciaris. The painting,cubist in style, adumbrates three figures, two of whom seem to be seated behind atable, holding musical instruments, while a third broods behind a fragment of musi-cal manuscript. Again the teacher emphasized the importance of accurate observation,saying nothing that might influence the student's interpretation in any way. The stu-dent's first step was, as before, to record observations in words or phrases only.SAMPLE OBSERVATIONSmusiccardf and crrd gamesconversationlooks like instruments=mastic atmosphereshadows reflect evening or dawnowltablegiraffeanimal on floormonster in right cornersorrowwarsthe world in a messpeople grieved over worldaffairsWhen the class 'nembers read and compared their observations, their revisedlists and first narratives tanded, as might be expected, to fall into a collective think-ing pattern overwhelmingly influenced by the last four or five comments. The classdiscussion, however, despite the diminution of originality, is useful at this stage.Here are some sequences of one group: 245243 \"This picture seems to show how the world situation is today. In the picture itself it seems as though each person or thing is doing something alone and not evencaring about what the others were doing. This seems to tie into the way the world istoday, people caring too much for themselves and not enough for others.\"\"I think that this picture shows the world as it is. At times people don't care about each other and they think they can make it on their own but really they allstrive for the same thing an could be better off if they worked together. They could unite and become better at w at they are trying to do.\"\"The three characters seem to be working together enjoying themselves whileother characters are hiding in the background. I think it's trying to say how the rich nations of the world are spending all of their wealth on their enjoyment and not car-ing about the poorer countries because they are poor and not as important as thewealthy nations.\"\"This is a story of three different people or objects. It is reflecting brother- hood and sharing, The important idea is working together. It could symbolize na- tions with different interests. One has a songsheet, one a clarinet, one a guitar, butall together playing and practicing. The cards on the table may suggest that beforetaking up their separate interests to share them, they sat together and worked at onecommon thing. This could go as an example of a nation good at one thing, another atsomething else, and still one more could get together, combine ideas, and make theworld a better place and improve. The artist might have been looking at the worldnow and kind of showing how he wished things were.\"\"I think everyone is adjoining and living together in peace. Not fighting orstirring up trouble. They seem to be good friends each doing what they please andthey are doing it in brotherhood.\"Some of these obviously show greater promise than others -- at least, as re-gards usage and mechanics.It should be pointed out, however, that a wealth ofideas and dormant creativity may lie beneath mounds of verbal ineptitude. Theteacher's task is to demonstrate, as has been iterated at some length in the languagesection of this course of study, that ideas simply cannot be expressed precisely, ifat all, without some verbal facility.Another group detected no sociological overtones; they pursued instead a coursegenerally more descriptive than interpretive\"it looks like a desk with some papers on it and a lamp above it with dots onit.Beside the desk, looks like a man in a wild suit and beside him is a piano withthe music on it.On the opposite side of the desk it looks like a shadow of a dog orwolf.Going across the man it looks like a guitar and above the piano looks like anoutline of an owl.

It looks like a church in the background with a red school beside it, and the school has a fence around it. It is a cloudy day with no sun.\"These last sequences were written in one forty-five minute period by studentswho had previously yielded only sterile, labored phrases. They had never evinceda capacity to produce even this modest quantity, not through an inability to write, butbecause their powers of observation were undeveloped. On the basis of this researchand pilot teaching, it is believed that anyone can learn to write; but no one can learnto write whose observational powers cannot supply great quantities of rich imagery tothe intellect.In subsequent lessons which eliminated oilss discussion until sequences werewritten, student writing demonstrated far more individuality, grew out of actual ob-servation, and reflected little tendency to socialized thinking and writing. 247245 A. DESCRIPTIONBackgroundDescription may be defined as a discourse, or piece of writing, intended togive a mental image of something experienced. In the previous sequences, the stu- dent has been introduced to massive doses of sensory experiences, some vicarious.He will now attempt to record these experiences in order to convey mental images tosomeone else.Suggested Classroom ActivityStudents in the pilot program were asked to take from their joIrnals their ob-servations of Wyeth's \"That Gentleman\", and work them into a descriptive sequence,the ideas or images of which follow one another in some kind of order.SAMPLE STUDENT SEQUENCES\"I came because he sent fpr me. The bo :' said Old J. P. needed help. When I came in he was just sitting, tilted back in his chair, his legs crossed, staring iittothe corner.He didn't look as though he needed help. There was something strongand independent about him. His straight back and lean body and his big rough handssuggested hard work.\"Another student described the room:\"The gentleman's room was neat. There wasn't much in it, but everything wasin its place. He must have lived alone because his shoes were on the table and therewere no curtains on the windows and everything was so dark. No woman would everlive in a place like that.Everything was neat though. A pair of scissors and a keywere hung on the wall -- neatly and carefully, not just tossed on a table.\"The following list suggests ways in which the student may be guided in compos-ing an effective descriptive sequence.1.In writing descriptive passages, appeal to as many senses as possible,using concrete, descriptive words.2.Leave out unnecessary details.3.For a unified effect, choose adjectives and adverbs carefully. Imprecise modifiers spoil the effect; too many tend to weaken the continuity.4.Realize that well-chosen verbs are stronger than adjectives and adverbs.5.Concentrate upon a single effect; include nothing that is not organicallyrelated to your basic theme. 24824'6 6.Place yourself in an imaginary (if you are writing from memory), oractual position, and include only those things that may be seen from thatone position.7.Describe exactly what you see, objectively. That is avoid interpretation(propaganda) in which you try consciously to influence your reader.8.Since description is essentially spatial, your ordering of details shouldmove forward naturally.For example:a.b.c.d.e.f.g.From largest to smallestFrom darkest to to rightFrom top to bottomFrom background to foregroundFrom front to back (of an object)From greater to less importanceThis ordering may, of course, be reversed, depending upon the needspassage.of the B. NARRATIVEBackgroundNarrative should be distinguished from description. It is a story; it is also the art or practice of reciting the details of a story. Moreover, sires the vezy nature of narration demands a thread of unity, the problem of topic sentence and paragraphunity may be most successfully treated after the student has molded his preliminarywords and phrases into some kind of sequence.Suggested Classroom ActivityDramatic photographs offer one of the best stimuli for eliciting stories. A pho-tograph depicting two youngsters throwing stones at Russian tanks in East Berlin wasshown to a class. The students were asked to observe the picture, record their im-pressions, then imagine streethatreddesolationhopelessness 24924\"/ STUDENT PARAGRAPH\"When the tanks came, the people fled, that is, all but a few defiant patriots.The rumbling tarks, the menacing guns, even the threat of imminent death could notweaken their love of country. When the tanks pushed their ugly snouts around a cor-ner, only two young men re.nained to defy the monsters. The two kids expressed thehatred and desolation of all their people as they defiantly threw their stones andbricks. This truly a twentieth-century story of David and Goliath. People: of good will know in their hearts that 'David' will triumph again.\"The following is another list of guidelines which the student may use in compos-ing his narrative sequences.1.Before writing a narrative paragraph, the student should plan or outlinethe order of events in his narrative.2.The events of the passage should answer the questions, who, when,where, how, and why.3.Each paragraph, as well as each composition, should have a beginning,middle, and end.4.As in description, the student should present his ideas in specific,concrete details. The beginning student, normally disposed to employtrite, insipid, or egregiously inappropriate terms, should be encouragedto make his imagery as vivid as possible.5.He should exclude unnecessary details.6.Just as lescriptive writing must follow a spatial pattern -- an orderingof details -- narrative must always follow a natural chronological order,or time sequence.7.The narrative should include time signals, that is, words like after,before, later, subsequently, as well as phrases and clauses tharraptie reader aware of the passage of time.VERB TENSES IN NARRATION OBJECTIVEThe student will learn that each tense expresses a unique time. 250248! BackgroundThe grammar of various tenses has been treated at length in the language sec- tion of this course of study.Since tense means time, a discussion of its uses seemsmost appropriate in narration. In order to express accurately what he wants to say, the student must know that each tense expresses a unique time.The present tense has a number of uses. It expresses:1.present action:Brakes are screeching.Now you see it.2.habitual action:The family says Grace before meals every evening.3.future action:New models come out next January.4.a description of literary events:When Odysseus discoverE his men eating the lotus:blossom, 1.e is IETious.5.the historical present, like the description of literaryevents, records a past event as if it were occurring in the present:As he approaches, the old man turns and falls.Note: The use of the h!storical present is done for a specific literaryeffect. The student should be careful not to employ it in ordi-nary speech or narration.The past tense is used for all action before the present:There wasn't much in the room, but everything was in its place.The future tense is used for anticipated action:They will return in three days.The present perfect tc.ise expresses an indefinite time in the past.She has lived in Europe for many years.The past perfect tense expresses an action definitely completed before a giventime before the present:By nightfall, all motorists had turned on their he'dlights. 251249 The future perfect tense expresses a future action completed by a certain time:By the time he gets to Phoenix, he will have finished his book. DIAIOGUE OBJECTIVESThe student will discover that direct quotation is far more vivid, lively,and interesting than indirect quotation.The student will learn to use and realize the importance of correctpunctuation.The student will discover the importance of using dialogue tags; hewill also be aware that too many tags become ineffectual. BackgroundDialogue, recorded conversation, or speech between characters is essential tomany narratives. Written well, it can be the most interesting part of a story. But it also serves practical purposes. Dialogue:1.Convey information about what is happening in a narrative.or example:The boy said breathlessly, \"Old J. P. needs help. I know he does.He's just setting' in that cold cabin. No smoke coming'out of the chimney.\"2.reveals personality or character. For example:\"I wish I was a man,\" sobbed the boy, I'd carry him tothedoctor on my ba-:k.\"3.reveals a speaker's personal reactions. For example:\"When' ,aw him lust settin' there, I got that feelin' in mybelly like I'd been kicked.\"Dialogue can make the narrative events lively and real. It is far more effective to show what is happening than merely to tell about it, Indeed, the difference between 252s\u00b0 showing and telling may be shown in the distinction between direct and indirect quota-tions..To record a conversation indirectly usually produces a dull pedestrian pieceof writing:\"When I called to the two men crossing my field, the older one asked me whatI wanted. Thinking about my dead brother, I looked at the muzzle of this mm's shot-gun and told him I just wanted to ask him something. He said that maybe he didn'twant to talk with me, and when his companion laughed and said the same thing, the oldman wheeled around, jabbing the shotgun into his companion's chest. After he told the little man to shut up, he turned back to me, aimed the shotgun at my face and toldme he would like to hear what I had planned to ask.\"The same narration written in dialogue form is more lively and interesting.It conveys essentially the same information, but in addition, reveals otherwise ob-scure aspects of the speakers' personalities. Following is the same sequence of events recast in dialogue form:\"Hey, you:\" I called to the two men walking across my field.\"What yew want?\" growled the older man.I looked at the muzzle of his shotgun and though about my murdered brother.\"I just wanted to ask you something.\"\"Well, maybe I don't want to talk to yew.\"\"Yeah, maybe he don't,\" laughed the little man with the pipe.The old man wheeled around, jabbing the shotgun into his companion's chest.\"Yew shet up!\" He then turned back to me, deliberately aiming the shotgun at myface.\"But jest the same, I'd like to hear what yew plan to ask.\"A twin hazard to be avoided in the writing of dialogue involves the question ofwho is speaking. On the one hand, the student should use dialogue tags, for example,said Joe, growled the older man, grunted the boy. (Also, Cf. \"Word Ganes\", this course of study.)On the other hand, too many tags may sound monotonous and re-tard the action.Much of the difficulty may be resolved through careful punctuation. The studentshould always begin a new paragraph with each change of speaker. He should also becareful to observe the following conventions. The student should:1.use quotation marks before and after words spoken by anycharacter.\"Good morning, indeed,\" he snorted,2.begin every quotation with a capital letter.3.remember that the second part of an Interrupted quotationbegins with a small letter.\"Well, well,\" she exaggerated, \"it's nice to see you.\" 253251 4.further remember that dialogue tags should be set off with commas.5.use either a comma, a question mark, or an exclamation pointat the end of his quotation -- but within the quotation mark.As the need becomes apparent, the teacher should refer to his text for morerefined points in punctuating dialogue.Dialogue should soind natural. Since speech for most people is usually less formal than their written expression, the recording of dialogue will tend to includemore contractions.Finally, the studert should be cautioned against the use of too much dialect.Dialect, judiciously chosen and used sparingly, can add dimension to a characterportrayal, but inserted thoughtlessly and indiscriminately, it is difficult to read,can destroy the continuily and clarity of a dialogue, and probably will alienate thereader. POETIC FORMS OBJECTIVES: The student will become acquainted with some elementary poetic forms.The student will learn that everyday expression is often poetic.The student will dist:over that there is a poetic truth to be sound in meta-phorical description. Background:Students, and indeed many adults, are often alienated from the art form called\"poetry\". To be sure, much poetry, and especially modern poetry, is difficult. In- verted word order, words suggesting unusual connotations, and a poet's private sym-bolism often combine to raise an appalling obstacle to the understanding and appreci-ation of a poem.Such obstacles need not and should not be encountered early in the student'scareer. Much poetry is available that speaks directly to the neophyte, employingsimple, comprehensible, yet significant language. Moreover, one or two skirmishes with a difficult poem is sometimes enough to close the student's mind indefinitely tothe wealth of the entire art form. 25425%: How, then, should the student be introduced to such \"formidable\" literature?One way is through compositiun, by stimulating him to write his own poems. It is possible to stimulate student interest by introducing him to some elementary poeticforms, simple yet challenging enough to capture his imagination, hold his interest,and lead him to discover their usefulness for expressing his inner thoughts andfeelings.Suggested Classroom Activities:1.An 2.,,proach to poetic utterance may be employed in an informal kind ofwriting which is simply a two-line, metaphorical comparison. The stu-dent is asked to make an oriiVnal statement, for example:\"I see a new car,\"In the second line, he must make three observationt about the first, usingadjectilos, participles, or hyphenated,modifiers. Thus:\"I see a new car,Mag-wheeled, smooth-shit.e, shark-speed.\"The same activity may be applied to the sense of sound:9 hear children playing,Squealing, laughing, scattering like birds.\"...or to the sense of touch:\"I pick up a puppy,Sleek-haired, wiggly-chewing, wet...\"2.Another activity demanding somewhat more attention to form is a \"qua-train\", consisting of words only, not in sequence, but associated with asingle subject. The words may be any part of speech, but they must beseparated by commas.The first and third lines are made up of four words each; the second andfourth contain three each:\"Diving, swimming, plunging, rising,Deep, blue, cool,Sunning, drying, shivering, toweling,Warm, baked, pool.If the student can make the final word in lines two and four rhyme, hewill be one step closer to understanding the poetic form.3.Still another form is one shaped like a diamond. Again, there is nosequence, but the words must be related. With a total of twenty-five 255g88 syllables, the student begins with a word of one syllable, under whichhe writes a line of two syllables. Each succeeding line contains onemore syllable until a line of five is reached. Thereafter, the lines di-minish in syllables, down to the last Five\" is one which has invariably proven success-ful in the classroom.Like the other forms, it is essentially a game.With a total of five lines, the student must write for his first line a noun,for the second, two adjectives modifying the noun. His third line willconsist of three modifying verbals. In the fourth, he makes a statement related to the foregoing lines, and in the last line, he writes an appositive:Neil ArmstrongCourageous, loyal,Distinguished, appointed, to lead.First human being to step upon the moon.Astronaut.5.The same technique may be applied to other verse forms, some of thebetter known of which are the couplet like Ezra Pound's \"Station in theMetro\", the cinquain like those of Adelaide Crapsey, and the well-known,seventeen syllable Haiku, in which the first and third lines contain fivesyllables, and the second contains seven. 256254 IVTHE SENTENCE OBJECTIVE:The student will learn that the structure of sentences should be variedin length, form, and beginnings.BackgroundTo obtain an overview of our method in composition, we might profitablyborrow from W. B. Yeats his double spiral image. The student's beginningat the top or open end of one spiral, suggests his attempt to record greatquantities of observed sensory impressions. As the spiral descends andnarrows, this mass of inchoate imagery is to be molded into increasinglycoherent form. Such molding must be accomplished by the teacher gradually,intelligently, and diplomatically, so that the creative impulse remainsspontaneous and uninhibited. (This allusion to \"creative impulse\", incidentally, is not intended to imply that any but a minute percentage of students is trulyartistically creative. A realistic conjecture might be that although moststudents are seldom inspired to write, they can learn, through much practiceand with the help of wise and kindly instruction, to express their ideas inrespale -- even excellent prose.As the student pursues the course of one spiral leading him to expresshis thoughts, he may-- to continue the metaphor--begin at the small end ofanother spiral, working first with sentences, then with paragraphs, essays,etc., in an ever-widening and ascending path. Borrowing from his newly acquired treasury of images. the student may ascend the second spiral,nvestigating better modes of expression.Sentence VarietyOne reason for monotonous, vap'd, and ineffective writing lies in lackof sentence variety. Such problems may be eliminated by varying the length,form, and beginnings of sentences.The length of sentences should be varied. While short sentencesare necessary for dialogue, for exciting dramatic passages, and fJroccasional salient points in exposition, too many can result in a dull, choppystyle:For example:It sounds like a ceremony for someone who has died. It sounds sad. Everyone is quiet and sad.It could be in church or outside at the cemetery...There was singing there. 257255. Revised:Everything about the ceremony was sad. While the heavy tones of the organ and the funeral singing echoed through the church, the people just satquietly staring or shaking with silent sobs.In an attempt to revise his short, choppy sentences, the student oftenerrs in constructing long sentences, monotonously tied together withconnectives:First we bought an old car at the junkies and brought it home and putit in the garage, and so then we started to take it apart and put it togetheragain and it finally started to run the motor.Revised:After we bought the old car at the junk yard, we brought it home andput it in the garage.First, we took it apart, bought some new spark plugs,points, and a coil, then we put it together again, Believe it or not, we gotthe motor running'The form of sentences should also be varied. Simple sentences are basic. Compound sentences are useful; they combine closely related ideas. Whilesimple and compound sentences are basic and useful, it is the complex sentence,however, that permits expr.ession of that most important logical element:subordination of ideas. References to all these structures may be found inthe language section of this course of study. Examples may be found in anygood English language (grammar) text.Although the order of the basic English sentence--subject, verb, object- -may be c7ntactically acceptable, too many sentences of this constructionmake dull reading. Sentence beginnings, then, should be varied.1.Begin with single-word modifiers:adjectives- Frenzied and inhuman, the mob destroyed itsown university.Kind and gentle, the child was no match forher tormenters.adverbs-Cautiously, the boy picked up the fire cracker.Later, they would return.Participles -Whispering, the girls were awake all night.Exhausted, the policeman carried a child tosafety. 258256 2.Begin with phrases:prepositional - Across the open field ran a pack of dogs.Inside the wooden horse the soldiers waited.participial -Singing to himself, he thought of the next vacation.Frozen with fright, Helen inched along theGwaying girder.infinitive -To be practical, never dive Pito shallow water.To reach the other side you must go around thehill.3.Begin with subordinate clauses:Although we were hungry, we could not eat in that place.If you don't go home now, your father will be angry. Work with the sentence is generally drill work. Although the teachershould devote much time to this aspect of writing, he must be aware that thislearning does not automatically transfer itself to composition. The applicationmust be pointed out repeatedly, both in the construction of paragraphs anti intheir revision. 259257 V. THE PARAGRAPH OBJECTIVES:The student will:learn that each paragraph develops a central idea.realize the necessity for varying the lengths of his paragraphs.become aware that each paragraph within an essay has itsown function.learn that transitional terms are necessary to link paragraphsas well as the elements within a paragraph.become familiar with the various ways of developing a para-graph. BackgroundThe paragraph originated in Greek writing as a convenience for the reader.Since long, unbroken pages of manuscript were difficult to read, writers foundit useful to inscribe a mark (graphos) in the margin alongside (para) a writtenpage.The paragraph form, however, is more than a mere convenience; itusually embodies a central idea. It may be long or short, depending upon the ease with which the writer thinks his reader can grasp his message. It may contain many sentences, or few, or even one; but its sentences should all relate tothe central Idea.This central idea is expressed in a topic sentence which for maximumeffectiveness should implicitly include all the subsidiary ideas within the para-graph.There is no unalterable rule that the topic sentence must be the first-- it may be in the middle, and sometimes is most effective as the last sentence-- but, for the beginner,it most conveniently opens the paragraph.As the student becomes more proficient, his paragraphs generally lengthen,with mere words and repetitions at first, but eventually with genuine, clearly-expressed ideas.Mere length, obviously, is not the goal. The expression of some thoughts requires, extensive illustration, reasoning,documentation, evidence, authority, comparison, contrast, etc. ,while the mpact of others is most cogently expressed in short, crisp paragraphs. Hence, like the sentence, paragraph length should be varlet' 260258 .' Apart from drill work, the paragraph is seldom written as an end initself; it functions more often as an indispensable part of a larger unit. This being true, not every paragraph will be written the same way, or for the samepurpose.The opening paragraph of an essay, for example, should state thetopic and make some general observations about the thesis. The middle para- graphs develop the thesis by various methods, while the last reiterates, sum-marizes, recapitulates, and, finally, restates the topic.The function of the first paragraph in an essay is introductory. To borrow an earlier image, we suggest that this first paragraph be conceived as a spiralin which the student's opening sentence will be a generalization.The last paragraph will be constructed as the exact opposite of the first,a spiral in reverse.Here the first sentence will rephrase the topic, employing atransitional word like thus, therefore, hence, finally, etc. As stated before. thefunction of this last paragraph is to reiterate and summarize.The middle paragraph carries the burden of the essay; it is the work horse.Having a beginning, a middle, and an end itself, it is an essay in microcosm. Yet it is not completely sell-contained; it must be harnessed to the previousparagraph by repeating a word, echoing an idea, or employing transitional terms.Transitional terms are important not only for linking paragraphs, but foreffecting smooth transitions between sentences within the paragraph. Following is a list of transitions which should become part of everyone's writing vocabulary.Two words of caution, however: first the student should learn these terms not inan isolated list, but in the context of his composition. Second, the terms should be used wisely and when necessary; otherwise; they become mere resultat the same time Development of a paragraph is usually the addition of information to clarifythe topic.This may be accomplished in a number of ways. Probably, the common method is that of illustration. Here, the student submits an example. or possibly several examples, to explain his topic. Another method is through an appeal toauthority.While a point may be supported convincingly by quotations from properuuthorltles, care should be taken to cite people who are authorities on the topic inquestion.261259 Other methods of paragraph development are comparison, in which the topicsuggests a resemblance to something while the paragraphbuilds up the details; contrast, in which similar things are compared to emphasize their differences;definition, in which the topic is explained by synonym, function, value, class,description, etc.Finally, the studInt's paragraph may be most effectivelydeveloped through description or narration. Excellent examples of all of these types will be found in any good composition text. 260262 VI. THE OUTLINE OBJECTIVES:The student should be aware of the purpose of the outline.The student should know the mechanics of the outline.Background:Simply, the student should become aware that the outline is a diagram whichhelps place the speaker or writer's ideas in order and also indicates the importanceof each idea.It is the underlying structure of all composition, the bare bones, soto speak. As the construction of a building calls for a blueprint, so does the creationof an oral or written composition.Students should know the salient advantages of a paragraph outline, namelythat:It provides the entire content in a very short form.It furnishes the writer with a guide to the expression of his ideas.It is a vehicle of meaning that is easy to remember for use in oralcomposition.It provides a better understanding of facts because the details supportingthem are arranged according to the relationship between them.Stui.ents should become versed in the outline form and in the use of:Roman numerals to indicate the main topicsCapital letters to indicate the subdivisions of the topicsArabic numerals to indicate subtopics of those divisionsSmall letters to divide a subtopic into its partsIndentations to keep topics and subtopics in their proper placesSAMPLE OUTLINECanadian-American Discussion of St. Lawrence Seaway1.Arguments against SeawayA.Cost winter monthsC.Fears of business loss1.U. S. Seaports2.Railroads2.Arguments for SeawayA.\"Seacoast\" for Great Lakes - St. Lawrence regionB.Increased profits1.Larger trade2.Cheaper shippingThrough practice in outlining well-organized material, the student should be-come familiar with the ways of outlines. He should realize that outlining can help him make better organized and more effective compositions of all kinds. He should :earn to separate his topic into its main divisions , to decide the proper order for presenting the different parts, to recognize which id;:as are important enough tobe main topics, and to recognize which should be subtopics.He should learn to review his finished outline to make sure that there is noA without a B, no 1 without a 2, no small a that is not followed by a small b. He should understand that this is necessary because you can't divide a subject into onepart.VII The Letter OBJECTIVES:The student will understand that the main purpose of a letter is to get his mean-ing across to the reader.He will become aware that the key words in letter writing are shortness, sim-plicity of expression, and strength of word selection.He will learn the form of the friendly and business letter, and he will learnthe distinctive types of earh Wald.BackgroundThe writing of letters is undoubtedly one of the most practical aspects of thestudy of composition. As the student progresses through the middle school and as hematures, letter writing should take on increasing significance for him. If he istaught well and properly during these formative years, the writing of IPttzyrs willcease to be a \"lost art.\" There are many, many occasions during the school yearwhen the student can write a note to fill an actual need. '12'rhaps, this is the only 2842621 J time that letter writing should be taught. The writer has his purpose clearly in mindand he has a definite audience--often an eager one.When the actual occasion for writing a letter arises, the teacher may reviewthe form and parts of the friendly and business letter with the students. Each student,of course, should be allowed complete freedom of expression in the body of the letter.By the end of middle school the student should be aware that there are many categoriesof friendly letter: of invitation, of acceptance, of regret, of thanks, of sympathy, ofcongratulations, of news, and of an expository nature. He should be aware, too, that business letters may be written to order materials of one kind or another, to requestinformation, or to apply for a job.Suggested Classroom Activities1.Students can write the various types of friendly letters as actual situationsarise during the school year necessitating their use.2.Students can take advantage of the many opportunities pi.sented during theschool year to write business letters. They might write to various publish- ing houses, to foreign embassies, to department stores, and to leaders inthe community.3.Students can write letters in response to published letters in the \"Letters-to-the-Editor\" column of their local newspaper. These letters do not nec-essarily have to be for publication.4.Students can keep a file in their journals of 'the various types of friendlyand business letters to use as models. 263 265 VIII GUIDE FOR REVISION AND EVALUATION OF COMPOSITIONIf students are to learn to write well, they must write often. As long as writing is regarded as an unnatural act, performed only on rare occasions, andsubject to extreme criticism, students will not learn to write. In the final anal- ysis there is not too much to say about writing. There are only a few importantskills, but it will take the student many years to master them. In the most ideal classroom situation the student should not listen to talk about writing, but insteadshould write, rewrite, or respond to student writing through discussions andindividual conferences.Students have not been encouraged to write freely in the past because thispractice seemed to place an almost intolerable burden on the teacher who hadto correct all this work. Once the teacher relieves himself of the false assump-tion that he must correct each and every student paper, the natural flow ofwriting can proceed as it should. It is the student who must learn to correct his own paper and assume responsibility along with the teacher for his improvement.There is still much for the teacher of composition to do though. If he accepts the proposition that students must be taught individually and that thereare very few group writing problems peculiar to the seventh grade or the ninthgrade, his task becomes very formidable indeed. This section proposes to outline methods that will aid the teacher and the student in the revision and evaluation ofcomposition.REVISION OF COMPOSITIONTHE TEACHER CAN:1.Assist students while they are in the process of writing, thus preventingmany errors from being made.2.Use an oral approach in which students' work is read for class discus-sion and constructive criticism.3.Duplicate certain papers for study and analysis by the class.4.Use the overhead and opaque projectors for discussion and analysis ofstudent's work and ior study of professional samples to see how variouspoints in writing were handled by a skillful author.5.Provide individualized composition work through the use of the manycommercial products available, so that time may be spent in conferencewith individual students on their specific writing problems.6.Determine necessary basic points that can be taught to the class as awhole based upon an analysis of class work.7.Conduct sessiois where all students have an opportunity to contribute toa joint writing effort.This will involve much continuous revision andmany problems may be resolved this way. 266 264 8.Frequently exhibit around the room the final revisions of the more ablestudents.This will give all students a high standard to work toward inthe revision of their own compositions.9.Draw up lists of standards for students to use in the revision of theirwork. There must be a common point of reference between teacher andstudents for criticism to be meaningful.THE STUDENT CAN:1.Become aware that good writing is rewriting.2.Develop a sense of responsibility for improving his own writing skills.3.Use standard check lists that have been worked out cooperatively by theclass and teacher for revision of his own work.4.Keep a journal of all of his work for later study and revision and perhapsfor nassing on to his next teacher.5.Exchange written work with classmates for help in revision on the theorythat others can see our mistakes better than we can ourselves.6.Allow himself a \"cooling-off' period after he finished his first draft sothat he may approach the job of revision in a more objective manner.7.Study the work of his classmates and that of professional writers to seehow they have handled particular problems which are plaguing him. Ifthe student is having trouble getting started, he might wisely scan theefforts of his classmates, copy their beginning sentences in his journal,and study them for clarification of his own particular problem. 265267 10 SUGGESTED STUDENT GUIDES FOR REVISIONGUIDE FOR REVISION OF WRITINGWORD CHECK1.Have you used specific words rather than general ones ?2.Have you used words on the proper level of usage ?3.Have you used words of the proper degree of meaning?4.Have you used synonyms and antonyms judiciously?5.Have you used any unnecessary words or \"deadwood'?

Check any words in the diction- ary that you are unsure of.10.Have you kept your handwriting legible ?11.Have you made your paper neat and correct in form so that its appearance will cause a favorable reaction in the reader ? EVALUATION OF COMPOSITIONComposition concerns itself with acquiring ideas, organizing them effectively,and developing them logically. Secondarily, these ideas must be expressed in the most effective manner possible. Finally, grammar, usage, and mechanics must be taken in account.These skills are listed according to their priority and it behoovesthe conscientious teacher to adopt such a priority of his own.In evaluation as in the teaching of composition the teacher's approach shouldbe positive.He should endeavor to show the student what he can do rather than whathe cannot do.Wherever and whenever possible the student should be encouraged tolearn the elements of effective writing himself. Since students vary in the rate atwhich they learn things, evaluation as well as instruction will have to be conductedalmost on an individual basis.The teacher's problems in evaluation will be greatly lessened if he realizesthat many of the most important problems in composition are inherent in the writingof a single paragraph.This is not meant to limit the amount of writing that studentsdo, but it is almost axiomatic that one sharp, precise paragraph is more to the pointthan three or four less effective ones and that one paragraph can be just as illuminat-ing to the teacher. 269267. EVALUATION TECHNIQUES FOR THE TEACHER1.BE CONSTRUCTIVE AND SPECIFIC IN ALL CRITICISM,Never be contert to merely indicate a weakness in the student's compositionefforts.Give specific instructions for improvement, and insist that students keepa record in their journals of your recommendations.2.MAINTAIN A SENSE OF PRIORITIES.Always remember that the first priority in written composition is the acquiring,organizing, and developing of ideas. In your comments react or respond to what the writer is saying and not simply to how he is saying it.3.BE A SELECTIVE MARKER.Show some restraint in the marking of errors. It is hardly ever necessary or even wise to rigorously identify every single e::ror. All too often a minor error in spelling or punctuation receives as much emphasis as a major error in organization.4.MAKE USE OF PEER GROUP JUDGMENT.Take advantage of the fat that middle school students enjoy writing for anaudience of their peers and also enjoy the opportunity to exchange papers and com-ment freely on ene another's work.5.PUT HEAVY STRESS ON THE INDIVIDUAL APPROACH.As often as possible consult with the students on an individual basis. Realize that there is actually no substitute for personal attention to a particular student'swriting problems.6.PUT YOURSELF IN THE PLACE OF THE STUDENT.As often as possible, write the assignment that the students are undertakingyourself.This can be a great aid in appreciating the particular problems of theassignment and a greater aid in evaluating the class responso. This technique will undoubtedly cause you to be more sympathetic and realistic in evaluation. CRITERIA FOR TEACHER\"S EVALUATIONIn judging the merits of students' compositions it is suggested that the teacheruse as criteria the following four significant elements: vocabulary, originality,organization, and the use of related Ideas. They will be extremely useful in diagno-sing student's weak points and in helping to improve their work. 27020 using:In vocabulary usage the teacher should check the student's proficiency in 1.words that appeal to the E ells es2.words which delineate shades of meaning3,specific words to express actions4,synonyms and ar.tonyms5,colorful fivires of speechIn the area of originality the teacher should check to see if the student'scomposition contains:1.new ways of relating something2.individual interpretations of commonplace thoughts3,original interpretations of old ideas4.unusual handling or placement of wordsIn the area of organization the teacher should check to see if the compositioncontains:1,a fully expressed main idea2,all minor ideas supporting main idea3.a building of ideas in harmony with the mood4,no irrelevant details.In the area of the use of related ideas the teacher should check to see if thecomposition contains:1.ideas of depth and feeling2,associated ideas, fully developed and following each other naturally3,a full treatment of the subject withclarity and styleThe teacher should understand that growth is best measured by examininga sequential series of composiVons throughout the months of the year. In the growth of the individual student in writing swill is the important thing rather thanthe comparison of his work with his peer's. This is one reason that we make con- stant reference to the /Peeping of a journal. It is almost all essential. 271268 IX. WORD STUDY FOR COMPOSITION OBJECTIVES:The student will:make habitual the selection of words that help the reader or listenersee, hear, smell, feel, and taste as accurately as possible theintended sensations and meanings. In short he should master the skill of expressing his ideas in specific and precise terms ratherthan vague and general ones.become aware in choosing his words for both oral and written comp-osition that there are different levels of usage. This would include the understanding that with friends and family a colloquial or informalvocabulary is certainly quite proper, but that in more formal situa-tions wards must be chosen with an entirely different objective inmind.become aware that words have ascending levels of meaning and willbecome proficient in choosing a word of just the right power forthe meaning that he intends.become discriminating in the use of synonyms and antonyms, sothat his expression will not only be varied and vital but precis9lywhat he intended.He will also become alert to troublesomehomonyms that may distort his meaning.become proficient in the understanding and use of the connotativeas well as the denotative meanings of words.become imbued with the philosophy that the study of wards canbe a most enjoyable activity through the use of word games.BackgroundPut simply, the purpose of word study is to provide the student with the meansto express in speech or writing the ideas that he has in mind. Though it is possiblefor him to communicate wa very limited vocabulary by using facial expressior.s,gestures, and movemeils of the body, which he habitually does anyway, these de-vices will not be sufficient for him to express all the thoughts and feelings that fillhis mind.To be able to function effectively in toir complex world, the middle schoolstudent of the present and of the future will have to be competent in expressingfluently and explicitly what he has in mind. Therefore, he will have to possess totonly a broad vocabulary but a precise one. 272270 IAdmittedly, this will not be an easy task, but the implications of unsiccessfulcommunication are so great that the teacher and the student of the futu re cinnotafford to fail.Though the study of words is a most serious concern, it can aridshould be approached as a pleasurable activity for the student, as well as a sourceof increasing hiq power of expression.A. THE STUDY OF GENERAL AND SPECIFIC WORDSSAMPLE LESSON PLANAIM:The student will learn that some words are very general in meaning and are toLie avoided usually in composition.The student will. also become aware that every general word has almost anunlimited number of specific words that may be substituted for is and that theselatter words are the backbone of effective expression.MATERIALS:A list of sentences written on the challtboarri all containing the general wordGO or some form of it.EXAMPLES1.Look at that car go down the street:2.The screaming fans in the stands watched their team go onto the field.3.The Jet went down the deck of the carrier.4.The angry boy went to his desk sullenly.5.Jane went to her room in a huff.6.Time noes so swiftly.7.The graceful horse went over the fence effortlessly.APPROACH:Read the sentences on the chalkboard with the class. Develop the thought thatone does not really have an accurate picture of how the car, the team, the jet, theangry boy, Jane, time, and the graceful horse proceeded aecause the word go is fartoo general' in meaning. Develop the understanding, too, that the selection of justthe right word requires careful thought and observation, which is one very goodreason why writers tend to be careful in word selection. Point out that there aremany other words than the word go that could much more accurately portray themeaning in the sentences under discussion. Suggest that it might be interesting to try to compile some of the more specific words that could be used to rewrite thesentences. 271273 PROCEDURE:Ask the students to record on paper as many specific words for the word go asthey can.When students have had sufficient time to exhaust their own possibilities,write the word go on the chalkboard and ask the class to make contributions. Com-pile as long a list as possible, not that length is an important criterion but rather toimpress the students with the boundless wealth of possibilities.SUMMARY:Lead the students to the conclusion that the many specific words recorded allhave the implicit meaning of the word go, but that they proceed beyond that initialstage and indicate many varying shades of meaning. This is the major understanding to be derived from lessons o; this type. Discuss some of the nuances of meaning. Have the students return to the original sentences on the chalkboard and replace theword go in each of them with a specific word from the list that has been compiled.Have the students record these specific words in their jcurnals for future referenceand for later expansion.SAMPLES OF SPECIFIC period of two weeks during which three or four brief lessons were con-ducted, one seventh grade class compiled frolicsomejoyfulsatisfied freejoyoussereneThe teacher may select any general or overworked word that he wishes fortreatment as suggested in the lesson plan or in some similar manner. Words such asbad, beautiful, great, person, and take are bound to be productive of many specificwords.He may take general wards from the students' own writing to initiate activitiesof this type.The ultimate goal, besides enriching the student's vocabulary, is toencourage the student to undertake some process of this type while he is in the actof writing and in the revision of his written work. The use of the precise word should become habitual if the student's writing is to achieve that clarity and individualitywhich will distinguish it from the efforts of his classmates. This is a plea for the use of more short words in our talk and inwhat we write.Through the lack of them, our speech is apt to grow stateand weak and, it may be true, to hold more sham than true thought.For long words at times tend to hide or blur what one says.What I mean is this: U we use long words too much, wt. are apt totalk in ruts and use the same old, worn ways of speech. This tends to make what we say dull, with no force or sting. But if we use short words, we have to say real things, things we know; and say them in a fresh way.We find it hard to hint or dodge or hide or half say things.For short words are bold.They say just what they mean. They donot leave you in doubt.They are clear and sharp, like signs cut in rock.Gelett Burgess For those teachers who prefer a more student-centered or process approachto the study of general and specific words, the following technique is suggested. It has the advantage of forcing eL,,ch student to work individually instead of relying onthe efforts of his classmates. In this method the student's chief aids are his back- ground and his skill in using the dictionary.Before class the teacher would prepare a duplicated sheet somewhat along thefollowing lines' 27827 GENERAL WORD: SAYdictate oratepacify roam rambleconfirm avercommand pausemourn persuade converse indentapologize fidget herald assert interrupt rampage manufacture argue declare intrudeplunder chatDIRECTIONSMany of these words are specific words for the genera-I . word \"SAY\".Some are not related in any way. See if you can separate the words into two categories: specific words and unrelated words. Use yourdictionary as necessary. The student's paper when finished would look like this:GENERAL orate intrude state merge rambleaverpersuade 277275'' 41'4 The teacher would have to determine the choice of words for lee'.4Qns such asthese on the basis of his knowledge of the abilities of his students..4he specificwords are important in themselves but the real value lies in the ..iord discriminationskill that the individual student achieves.In this type of lesson one great benefit is that the .s...,Cient works at his own paceand is only in competition with himself. The more abl:'Student upon finishing thefirst steps may proceed to a study of the variations:ii meanings of the specific wordsand from there may progress to use some of the nOrds in sentences of his own.In another variation of this technique 14.e teacher might prepare a sheet as fol-lows:GENERAL WORD:sauntermarchshamble dilatepervadestow ramblepetrifystragglegrapplescamperpranceambledisputecajolewanderdartstrut maturescurrystrideDIRECTIONSSome of these words have the same general meaning; some are un-related.Determine the general word and then make two categories ofspecific words and unrelated words. Study the variations in meaning of the specific words if you have time.The student's paper when finished would look like this: SPECIFIC WORD: WALKUNRELATED WORDSdilategrapplematurepervadepetrifydisputestowcajole 278276 Other Suggestions and Classroom Activities1.The teacher may provide on occasion sentences where specific wordsmustinserted by the students.2.W:itten work may be exchanged by students for helpful suggestions onthe use of more specific words3.The teacher should make one of the standards for checking all 1 Tittenwork the use of specific and precise words.4.Students should be encouraged to collect samples of the effective use ofspecific words from professional writers' works. 5.Students should be imbued with the philosophy that the ultimate test orword choice is whether the word chosen is the most meaningful word thatcould be used under the circumstances. As Jonathan Swift put it:\"Fit words in fit places.\"6.Students should learn that a thesaurus can be a tremendously useful toolin writing, but they should be forewarned against the use of indiscriminate\"synonyms,\"7.Since one of the major premises of this composition guide is that studentsmust learn to observe accurately and record their observations withclarity, it naturally follows that the teacher must insist upon the studentsusing specific words in describing these observations and for that matterin all of his composition work. The student must be conditioned to understand that he Is studying, words for practical and necessary ap-plication.Though word study, in itself, can be a fas:dnating occupation,the young student of the middle school should not study words in isolation.B. THE STUDY OF LEVELS OF USAGEIt is a futile if not impossible task to delineate the standards of modern English.Our language does not obey a kind of abstract logic, but instead follows the actualusage of people who speak and write it. Good English varies not only from period to period and from area to area but from social group to social group and from onekind of speaking and writing to another. Since words are the building blocks of language, they are subject to these variations also.Any attempt to define levels of usage will no doubt open avenues of controversy,but for our purposes of word study we have rather arbitrarily selected what we willcall the slang, informal, and formal levels. In our use of the word slang we wish to refer to the relaxed usage of the average person, whose conversation is sprinkledwith expressions such as \"squash\" or \"bean\" for head. His choice of words, how- ever, is quite consciously made and is not based on an ignorance of correct forms.In broad terms we would say that informal language describes tli.? real workaday lan-guage of educated people.Finally,oirnina English describes the ianguage of books and 279277 articles on serious subjecto, of reports, of literary prose, of lectures, speeches,and serious discussions.It is essential that students be aware of differing levels of usage and that theybe able to shift linguistic gears, so to speak, as the occasion requires it. Theyshould also be alerted to the understanding that one level is not necesscAly morecorrect than another and that the choice of a wurd depends upon its suitability to th,aulience and the situation.In short, appropriateness is the determining factor in\"good\" English and therefore in word selection,SAMPLE LESSON PLANAIM:Students will learn that there are varying levels of usage and that they mustchoose their words based upon their audience and tP^ particular situation.They will become aware that one word is not more correct than another butjust more suitable.MATEltiALS:A duplicated sheet prepared doughmad gagINFORMAL FORMAL splitresidencepredicamentcharlatancashapartmenttediousleavedepartfakerfinaLcesfightdullproblemanecdoteangryirateclothesaltercationattirejoke APPROACH:Initiate a discussion with the class concerning one of their favorite subjects:clothes.' Give them thP opportunity to describe what they wear around the house, inthe backyard, and in their immediate neighborhood. As:: them to describe what they wear when they go to a dance. There will undoubtedly be a free-flow of ideas. 280 .4I Ask why they wouldn't wear the same clothes to the dance that they wear around thehouse on a Saturday morning. The whole point of the discussion should revolvearound the fact that certain clothes are appropriate to the house and certain clothesare appropriate to the dance. Lead them to the correlation that words are exactly the same. Certain words are quite suZtable for intimate family use but would hardlybe appropriate in applying for a job. Point out the distinction between the different levels of usage and make quite certain that there is unanimity of thought on themeaning of slang, informal, and formal.PROCEDURE:Distribute the duplicated sheets. Explain to the students that you have provided the slang words and that it is their Job now to find the informal and formal wordsin the columns at the bottom of the sheet alid copy them in the appropriate spacesabove.They may use their dictionaries if it is necessary. When they are finished,their sheets should look something students to read the informal and formal versions of each word sothat all may check how well they have done. It is really immaterial to try to mark work of this type on the basis of how much each child has accomplished. The im-portant point to be developed is that words do have a level of usage. If the child only succeeded in finishing half the job bt:1 has this understanding, then he has achievedhis objective.In future lessons his skill at determining the proper word for the jobto be accomplished can be improved.. 281 Other Suggestions and Cbssroorn ActivitiesI.The teacher may provide the students with the slang form of certainwords and allow them to make up the informal and formal versions.2.The teacher may provide the students with the formal word and have themwork backwards to devise the informal ans.i slang versions.3.The teacher may provide the students with situations and ask them toindicate what level of usage would be proper.4.The students should reserve a secflon in their journals for the recordingof words on the slang, informal, and formal levels. C. THE STUDY OF ASCENDING LEVELS OF MEANINGIn the preceding section we have tried to help the student understand thatwords have varying levels of usage. Now we would like to have him understand thatwords also have varying levels or degrees of meaning. For example: pretty, beautiful, and eTisite denote the increasing degrees of the same idea. It is es- sential then tha the sGdent become skillful in be: acting the word of just the rightdegree to express the meaning that he has in mind. This is rather a delicate skill, but it is one in which the student of the middle school can begin to become proficient. 282280., SAMPLE LESSON PLANAIM:The student will learn that he must be aware of shades of meaning in choosingamong synonyms.He will enlarge and refine his vocabulary.MATERIALS:The teacher will prepare a duplicated sheet on this idea:\".DEGREES OF MEANINGLOW ..INIEMOMMI11 Discuss the word sad with the class. Point out situations where it could he applied; the young child' 4o does not get his way, the boy whose bicycle is stolen, themother who has been informed that her soldier son has been killed. Lead the class to understand that all three are sad, but that the one word hardly does jur ce to thevarying depths ci feeling involved. It should become obvious that there !tent be 1 words of vary.4 degrees to express the way that each of these people feels. Barn- , storm a few speeifid words for sad with SADbitterdesolateforlorn broken-hearteddespondentgrief-stricken dejecteddistressedheartbroken despairingdowncastmoody desperatedownheartedsullenPoint out that some of there words are stronger than others. Ask the class todecide which ones would best describe the boy who didn't get his own way, the boy wholost his bicycle, and the mother who had suffered such a great loss.Have students determine which of the following pairs of words is stronger inmeaning:sad-tragicsmall-minuteunusual-fantastichappy-hilariousProceed to a consideratinr of depths of meaning in three relatively synonymouswords:thrifty-stingy-miserlypalatable-delicious-lusciousPROCEDURE:Distribute the duplicated sheet to the students. They may :sow try to determine the two higher degrees of the words listed in the first column. It woulk.1 be most advantageous for the students to do as much of the work-sheet as they can independent-ly.After this initial attempt they may then refer to their dictionaries as necessary.Some students will accomplish more than others in a given time, but the teacher shouldunderstand that he is striving not for quantity but for a qualitative principle of wordstudy.a..The student's paper when finished will look somewhat of the class read their word decisions. This may lead to much discussion and argument, which is all to the good.. But the teacher should make sure that each student has become aware once again of the differentshades of meaning that exist among supposedly synonymous words. Some aildrenwill find this work rather difficult and will not seem to accomplish much at first,but the teacher should remind them that at this stage the understanding is the import-ant factor and that they will enlarge and ref'ne their vocabularies through con-scientious application.Other Suggestions an Classroom Activities1.Once again it is highly important for the student to understand thatthis technique has been studiNi for the purpose of incorporating it inhis composition and that it is not an end in itself.2.For quick drill the teacher can provide the students with situations tobe described as was done in the approach to the lesson above. The students can then barnstorm words that might be used as the teacherrecords them on the chalkboard. Students can then discuss the proper choice of words to describe the given situations.3.The stw'erit should check all of his written work to make sure that Ilehas used words of the proper degree of meaning.D. THE STUDY OF SYNONYMS, ANTONYMS, AND HOMONYMSMost students of the midd:e school will already be aware of the fact thatsynonyms are words that have the same or almost the same general or specificmeaning while antonyms are words which have approximately the opposite ;neaning.In individual case- Teacher may find it necessary to provide basic drill in theseunderstandings. The student should understand that whereas the synonym and antonymrelate to the meaning of words, the homonym, on the contrary, has only a minorconnection with vocabulary.With most students the problem will be to discolrage them from the indis-criminate use of these words. While it is true that the meanings of many words are sosimilar that occasionally one may be substituted for another, in general synonymouswords cannot be used interchangeably. Therefore, the students must learn to use s7--onyms carefully by observing the distinctions in their meanings. Conversely,careless use of synonyms will not only not help the students' writing but may actuallydistort it.In his study of general and specific words the student should understand thatspecific words based or ct particular general word are not by any means necessarilysimilar in meaning.As, a point of tact certain specific words for the same generalword may be antonyms. For example, crawl and leap are specific ways to go, butthe words are antonyms because they mean the opposite. 285283s Suggest( d Classroom Activities1.Teacher-prepared sheets with a list of words and a list of scrambledsynonyms c.t antonyms at the bottom. The student can match each word \\,Ith its synonym or antonym.2.The teacher can provide a list of words and allow the student to furnish hisown synonyms or antonyms.3.Students can provide series of synonyms barbarouscruelfierce ferocioussavage4.Using synonyms for given word such as house the students could showthe progression from the poorest covering over a peasant's head to themost palatial structure imaginable.5.Using examples culled from student writing the teacher may attempt tohave the students learn that one exact word is more meaningful than twoor more synonymous words. The teacher might use examples such asthese:deeds and doingsreal and truecostly and dearproud and vain(adventures)(genuine)(expensive)(conceited)The teLcher can provide lists of words and have the students add one wordthat is z synonym, one that is an antonym, and, if possible, one that isa homonym.Since the study of homonyms concerns itself mainly with the importanceof distinguishing the correct spelling and punctuation, it has only a minorconnection with word study.But the teacher must provide some activitiesfor associating homonym with their meanings. E. THE STUDY OF DENOTATION AND CONNOTATIONAnother important facet of word study for composition that the student mustbe versed in concerns itself with the dual way in which words do their work. Heshould know that words not only identify but have the power to move the reader.They move the reader in the sense that they stimulate a feeling or an emotion.While it is true that conc:nte words have the chief advantage of exactnens of 28628'4 identification -- denotation, the student should be aware of their limitations ineffective writing.Such words merely point, as it were, to an object. If the object ie pleasant, the word will communicate a pleasant feeling; if unpleasant, just theopposite will be true.The propaganda or emotional value of most concrete wordsis slight.The student should be led skillfully to the second part of a word's meaning-- its connotation.He should be made to realize that connotation is the feeling aword gives, above and beyond the dictionary meaning. Because some words stirthe emotions and constitute a powerful weapon in the hands of a skilled writer, thestudent should try to achieve a certain proficiency in this area. In an article that he is reading whern one speaker burbles and another asserts, it should be obviousto the student that the author is trying to arise different emotional responses in him.Every conscientious writer, and this includes students, must give consciousattention to the connotative value of his vocabulary. He should make every effortto use words not only to reveal his meaning most clearly, but also to prese:it it inthe most pleasing form.Suggested Classroom ActivitiesI.Students can lock into advertising, political speeches, propaganda, andother sources to find strong connotative words for class discussion.2.They can compile lists of words thr.t have unplcasant connotations for themand lists of words that have pleasant connotations.3.They can write their own advertisements for products or services usingconnotative words to help make what they are offering attractive.4.In two or three words they can descrihe th3 feelings that certain con-notative words arouse in them. Use words such as gooey, stiff-necked, homework, education, and book reports.5.The student can practice describing people with favorable and unfavorableannotative words. For example:FAVORABLE CONNOTATION UNFAVORABLE CONNOTATIONthriftydecisivedaringheroiccleveractiveChildlike`{devoted .1''' ambitiousinquisitive 287stingydomineeringfoolishfoolhardydeviousmischievouschildishoverbearingruthlessprying 6.The student should become aware that Vie onnotations of such words as democracy, truth, beauty, and goodness are both vague and numerous.He should train himself to state specifically what he means when heuses them, or make sure that the context makes their meaning clear.F. THE STUDY OF WORD GAMESThere is no more fascinating occupation than the playing of word games. Thesole purpose is fey the student to see that words can De fun and for him to exercisehis verbal ingenuit:. A few off moments of class time spent in this way should by nomeans be regarded As wasted. Students can be encouraged to devote part of their journals to games such as these that follow:1.Te'vr. SWIFTIESThe Lehnique in this game is to match an adverb with an actionand taus form a self-descriptive sentence.EXAMPLES\"I'm getting fat,\" said Tom stoutly.\"Oh, what a sunburn I hale:\" she said heatedly.\"Mom, will you press my pants?\" the boy said iro:dcally.\"He's my little brother,\" he said kiddishly.\"My father lost all his hair at an early age,\" he said baldly.\"Take my pictare,\" she said candidly.\"May I have another hot dog?\" he said frankly.\"I broke my leg,\" said Tom lamely.\"There should be a better way to make coffee,\" she said instantly.\"Let's not dig that matter op again,\" he said gravely.\"They treat yco like a prince,\" he said royally.2.This game matches a familiar statement with an occupation..;EXAMPLES\"A stitch in time saves nine,\" said the doctor.\"I have a bad case of laryngitis,\" said the lawyer.\"I can't control my pupils,\" said the teacher.\"I always give my awl,\" said the shoemaker.\"That was a close shave,\" said the barber.\"I'm fed up with this,\" said the cook.\"You hit the nail on the head,\" said the carpenter.3.In this sophisticated game known as the hink pink or the hir.ky pinky,it is necessary to think of two words that rhyme. Usually thefirst word will describe the second one. The name of the gamedepends upon how many syllables your twc rhyming words have. 288286 EXAMPLESwaves at sea would be an ocean motionan indoor rodent would be a house mousefood from the sea would be a fish disha nude bunny would be a hare harea bird keeper would be a tanager managerbeautiful jewels would be nice icea swimming menace would be a pool foola calf which has just been bora would be a new moo4.This word game could be caned fractured geography. You beginwith the abbreviation for a state. Now you pair it up with anotherword and create ignore Webster's dictionary and create wordsof your own by combining two other words. growerfulgroriousflubsfantabulousstumendousgrominoussappershocksEXAMPLES COMLUSION7 There are no short cuts to word power. A good vocabulary is the product ofyears of serious reading, of listening to intelligent talk, and of seeking to speak andwrite forcefully and clearly. This does lot imply that devices and methods for vocabulary building, as outlined in this curriculum guide, are not of value, but itdoes indicate that acquiring an expressive and meaningful vocabulary is inseparablefrom acquiring an education. This of course should be the major theme in the studyof words for composition.For after all composition, both oral and written, is theexpression of the sum total of a human being.(great .11d powerful)(grand and glorious)(flowers and and socks) 28928,7, X. ORAL COMPOSITION OBJECTIVESThe student will:learn to improve his skill in collecting and assembling material fororal presentation.develop techniques for organizing, preparing, and presenting oralreports.become familiar with various sources of information such asWebster's Third New International Dictionary, World Almanacand Book of various :ether sets ofencyclopedias.become proficient in the various skills of using an enc.r:lopedia,such as the use of guide words, the index, taking notes, makingan outline, and the recording of sources for convenience in veri-fying or relocating information.learn the characteristics of the various group discussion techniques.understand that good listening skills are an essential part of oralcomposition and will develop techniques for improving their own. BackgroundIn the study of oral composition the teacher P.m: the students should be guidedby the fact that spoken language preceded written language and that the ideal is notto speak as we write, but rather the reverse. Oral composition should be consideredas an important phase of language, pet se, and of an immensely utilitarian nature.Each student is going to be called upon many times during his school career and inlater life to take part in discussions, panels, and meetings. His success in thesevital democratic processes will depend to a great degree upon the training that hereceives during his school years.The student will be called upon more often to participate in group activitiesrather than to delver oral reports individually so that more emphasis should beplaced on the discussion activity. 29028g' It should be impressed upon the student that the group discuss' n activities re-quire as much preparation as the individual presentations if any meaningful or signifi-cant conclusions or solutions to problems are to be reached.The student should understand that listening skills are an essential part of dis-cussion activities and are the other side of the coin, so to speak. In short, the teacher can hardly place emphasis GP oral composition if he does not sim ultaneouslystress the importance of good listening. The two are inseparable.To derive the maximum benefit from this study the student must always havebefore him a set of standards for oral reports, discussiors, and for his role as agood listener.Suggested lists of standards will be found in this section of the guideThe actual standards used in any given classroom should be worked out cooperativelybetween ti a teacher and the students. Stulents should record these sets of standards in their jcirnals and refer to them frequently until they become cutomatic in theirobservalVIE 0 AL REPORThe two major factors that the student has to be concerned v.,ith are planning thetalknd presenting it.In the planning stage he should bear in mind the following sug-ge st tons.I.He should learn to select a subject that will not only be of interest to himbut to his intended audience. He should set up a definite purpobe or rea-son for talking about it.His talk may be to inform, to educate. to enter-tain, to move people to take action, or a combination of these factors.2.He should plan a short introduction in which he tells what Ile is going totalk about in such a way that he arouses the curiosity of his audienceand makes them want to hear more. This can be done by asking a pro-vocative question, giving a quotation, or reLacing a brief anecdote.3.The student should next plan the body of his report. This is the mostsubstantial part and should include all the experiences, facts, examples,ideas, and vtsull aids that he will use to inform his listeners and toserve the purpose that he established in step one.This means that he must select his material with the utmost discrimina-tion. Anything that dots not pertain to hit. subject or bear his purpose must be ruthlessly excluded no matter how interesting it is. In doing his research he sh.uld:a.Take only a few brief notes in his own words and make certainthat they meet the above two tests of applicability.b.Record each note on a separate slip of paper or on a small card. 291289 c.Write the source of his information below the note or on the backof the paper in case he has to refer to his source again or if hehas to defend his facts.3.Be on the alert for any visual material that he can use to illustratehis talk.e.Review his notes and number them in the order in which he plansto use them. At this point lie may decide to discard some informa-tion or he may decide to do further research.4.In the final step he will plan a conclusion for his report. It should be short, vivid, and forceful.It should give the audience somethiag to re-member and to think about. The actual wording of the conclusion shouldbe thought out with the greatest care.Note: Even though he is preparing an oral report, the student should beinstructed to write out his introduction and conclusion in full.These two parts of the report are so vital that he: should not leavethem to chance.In the pre-presentation and presentation stages the student may well benefitfrom the following suggestions:1.If it is possible and if there is time, he should tape his talk s he intends to present it.This will automatically lead to a num. 4 im- provements as he places himself in the position of his audience.2.He should rehearse his talk several or more times before a few friendsor classmates. They will undoubtedly be able to offer helpful suggestions.3.In delivering his talk he should speak in a sincere and natural manner,using gestures only as they come naturally to him. He should be instruc-ted to avoid the use of any artificial devices to sway his audience. In short, he should be himself.4.He should talk slowly and distinctly.5.He should refer to his notes when necessary, but should be cautionedagainst reading his talk or trying to deliver it from memory, word forword.6.He should learn to deliver a talk with a positive attitude, confident thatthat he has prepared his materially thoroughly. He should expect tosucceed and he will. 292296 SUGGESTED GITIDF FOR ORAL REPORTS toAre you reasonably zertain that your subject will interest your audienceas well as yourself?Have you limiteo your subject to what you can reasonably cover in asingle report ?Have you taken careful notes but in your own words ?Have you been selective and discriminating in the details that youhave chosen to use?Have you determined the best order of presentation for your details?Have you planned your introduction to inform your audience of yoursubject and to capture their interest right from the start?Hvve you planned a good concluding sentence or paragraph to wrapup your report neatly?Have you practiced and rehearsed your presentation until it is as freeof error as you can make it? DISCUSSION ACTIVITIESThe English classroom should lend itself admirably to the stimulation of discus-sion. There is much to talk about in the areas of literature, language, and composi-tion. There are important school issues, political happenin?:, personal affairs,books, movies and television, programs to occupy the interest of the students. Allthat remains is for the student to be introduced to the various formats for discussion.During his middle school years the student should have practice in and becomefamiliar with the following elements of discussion and their characteristics:1.Selecting a Formata.The discussion, though similar to a conversation, is different inthat it usually has a clearly defined purpose such as helping tomake a decision or solve a problem.b.The mlel discussion which consists of a small group of people whodiscuss different aspects of a subject to arouse the interest of thelarger group. The topic is chosen well in advance so that panelmembers have time to do special research. They may also discussthe topic briefly beforehand to make sure different points of :'eware brought out. 293 A panel always has a chairman or leader, who introduces the sub-ject, calls or the different speakers, and stimulates the discussionwhen it obviously is lagging. The other members of the panel mayalso ask questions of each other.A panel discussion is generally presented before an audience.After the panel has discussed a subject, the meeting is opened upto the audience at large for further comments or questions. Thetypical English classroom presents an ideal situation for this typeof activity.At the conclusion of the program the chairman usually makes asummary of the proceedings.Acting as panel leader should be a stimulating experience for cer-tain students as they come to realize the intricacies of the task.The leader has to be a fair and open-minded individual. He has tobe able to draw the members of `.Le panel out by skillful questioning.He mist be firm with those who try to monopolize the discussion.He must have a logical and comprehensive turn of mind if he is tobe able to present a summary of the entire proceedings at the end.c.The symposium is similar to the panel except that symposium mem-bers give well-prepared short speeches presenting different view-points.After the speeches the moderator invites general classdiscussion.d.The interview can be used as an effective vehicle in the classroom.One or more experts can be Invited to take part in a discussion.An interview presented before the class can stimulate a good dis-cussion. Several students can be selected as an Laterviewing teamwhile other students serve as \"experts.\"Students should become aware that much preparation goes into theconducting of a successful interview. They must learn to collectall the information possible about a subject before the interview.They must plan major questions in advance. They intIst learn theknack of encouraging people to talk, and they must learn to refrainfr,,m arguing with the person being interviewed.2.Selecting a Topic for DiscussionThe student should consider several factors in the chuice of a topic.a.The topic should be specific. A topic such as The United Nationswould be far too broad for class discussion.b.The topic should be timely to ensure interest. 294292 c.Information on the topic should be readily available. 01.The topic should be one that admits different points of view.e.The topic should be one on which students can get facts.3.Preparing for the Discussiona.The topic or problem should be defined very carefully in thestudent's mind.b.Students should secure all the information they can from anyavailable source.c.They should form some tentative opinions and think aboutsome possible solutions to a problem.dThey should come to the discussion prepared to listen, speak,and learn. They should be receptive to the ideas of others inthe group.Discussing the Tonic or ProhiemAfter a panel, symposium, interview, or following brief remarks by acapable moderator, the entire class should be involved in the diccussion. Studentsmay take part by asking questions and making comments.Note: In a large class there is hardly sufficient time for all class mem-hers to take port. To remedy this situation the students can bedivided into cluster groups of five or six. These groups :an dis-cuss the matter in question among themselves and then their indi-vidual chairmen can report to the larger group. In this way each student can have an opportunity to become actively involved in thebroader discussion.SUGGESTED GUIDE FOR DISCUSSIONBe prepared to talk intellieently about the subject by being adequatelyprepared.Restrict your talk to the topic of the discussion.Listen attentively to the ideas of every speaker.Don't take more than your fair share of time.Show each speaker courtesy by not interrupting him.Respect everyone's right to think and feel as he does, even thoughyou violently disagree with him. 295 LISTENING SKILLSSince an extremely large part of student learning comes to him through hisauditory sense, it is essential that he train himself to be a good listener. The stu- dent should realize that he can listen about four times as fast as a speaker can speak.To listen intelligently then, he must learn to use this extra time in picking out themain ideas of the speaker's talk, in judging the value of these ideas, and seeing howthey fit in with the ideas that he already has. These skills take time and constant practice. The student can become proficient in good listening if he adopts the follow-.ing techniques:1.He should get ready to listen by tuning in on the topic or subjectbeforehand.fle should learn as much as he can about it. He should formulate some questions in his own mind that he feels might beanswered in the speaker's talk. The student should train himselfnot to be distracted too long by the superficialities of the speaker'smanner of dress and appearance, always keeping uppermost in hismind that the important think is what the speaker has to say.2.He should train himself co listen for the main ideas, deciding assoon -3 possible tha chief point that the speaker is trying to make.This will give him a good strong hook on which to hang all the otherideas.Next, he should learn to pick out these supporting ideasselectively, since it viii be impossible for him to remember every 3.He should learn to listen critically. At the same time he should be trying to unravel the outline that the speaker has in mind. By pay-ing close attention to the examples and illustrations that the speakeruses to illustrate his points, the student can hopefully figure out thespeaker's rationale.'?fnally, the student should train himself to listen responsively.de should give his full attention to the speaker and should avoidany distracting gestures or acts. Above all, he should remember that good listening is active not passive.SUGGESTI'D GUIDE FOR LISTENINGSince the speaker usually begins with a statement of his purpose, U isessential to start listenftig the moment he begins to speak.Give your complete attention to the speaker.Think about the ideas that you are listening to rasher than allowing yourmind to wander aimlessly.Try to eistinguisl the main ideas from the supporting details.Listen for details or Ideas or illustrations that support the main ideas.Take bilef notes if you can do EO without losing your train of thought. 296264. SUGGESTED CLASSROOM ACTIVITIES1.Students mai select letters to the editor in their newspapers and bringthem in for discussion or for individual oral response.2.Much material of a controversial nature could be culled from the r.wwsmedia over a period of several days and then be used as source materialfor a panel discussion or a debate.3.Students could make a collection of the big news stories of the week andthen on Friday make an oral presentation: Highlights of the Week inReview.4.Using the classified ads as a basis, students could conduct job interviews.5.Students could interview one another with the purpose of writing a featurestory.6.Students could condense the news of the day into a five or ten minute oralwesentttion.7Students could discuss the book reviews in the Sunday editions to see howthey compare to their own book reports.8.In narration opportunities could be provided for students to tell true crimaginary stories or to recount stories from literature.9.In description students could describe a lost pet, watch, or billfold.They could also describe a hobby, a classmate, of a visitor.10.In exposition they could explain how to play a favorite game, how to makesomething, or how to perform some more or less complicated process.They can compare and contrast ideas or give a critical analysis of a bookor newspaper, an editorial, or a government policy.11.To develop listening skills, the students can take notes as you read ashort selection. They can check their progress by trying to a...swerquestions based on the reading.,12.Students could pair off. One would read a brief paragraph to the otherwhile the latter takes notes and then tries to repeat back the substanceof the paragraph. Then the partners could exchange roles. 297225 XI, MECHANICS FOR COMPOSITIONBackgroundThe student should become aware that punctuation Is the most important singledevice for making things easier tc read. It should be stressed that in oral compos- ition we use a system of shorter or longer pauses between words to join or separateour ideas, and we raise or lower our voices to show casual and emphatic relation-ships.In other words, we make ourselves understood not only by words but also bypauses and by stress or pitch. They should understand that punctuation is a systemwhereby we get our pauses and stresses down on paper, and that it is an indispensablefactor of good writing.Capitalization and punctuation are purely mechanical elements , but the teacher must resist the temptation to teach them in a mechanical way. They must be taughtfor the most part in relation to the needs and interests of the students, and constantreference should be made to the application of principles in the student's own writing.The text should be used chiefly as a guide.The major objective in the teaching of the mechanics of composition should beto n ake the student aware that capital letters and punctuation marks are invaluablesignals that help the reader understand thoughts expressed in writing. Secondly, the student should achieve an increasing proficiency in their use, and by the time hehas finished the middle grades, he should have come close to mastery of them all.The following principles cover the whole gamut of mechanics and are merelyintended as a source of ready reference for the teacher. Many of the principles havebeen studied by the student in the lower gr...des and will only have to be briefly reviewed.Some are more sophisticated and will require more concentrated teaching.A. THE USE OF CAPITAL LETTERSCapitalize the first word in a sentence.Note:if an interjection is followed by an exrlamation point, capitalize thefirst word in the following sentence:Gosh: That's a weird story:If an interjection is followed by a comma, do nest capitalize the first wordin the continuing sentence:Gosh, that's a weird story:2.Capitalize the first word in every verse of poetry.Sweet and low, sweet and low,Wind of the western sea,Low, low, breathe and blow,Wind of the western seat 298296 3.Capitalize the first word in a direct quotation.4.Capitalize the words I and Q5.Capitalize proper nouns that name places. Do not capitalize the articlethe unless it is part of the name.The Haguethe Baltic Sea6.Capitalize proper nouns naming races, nationalities, and religions.AmericanSemiteMethodistMoslemIndianGreek7.Capitalize proper nouns naming schooLs, churches, companies, orother organizations, Do not capitali7.e prepositions or conjunctions.Federal Communications CommissionMass. College of *?hormacy8.Capitalize proper nouns naming persons.9.Capitalize proper nouns referring to the Deity.10.Capitalize proper nouns naming days, mont',.s, and holidays.11.Capitalize proper nouns naming historical events.12.Capitalize titles of books and other publications.Note:Capitalize the first word of a title even if it is a, the, or of. Ifone of these words appears internrlly in the titre, rris not Capital-ized.The Time of his Life13.Capitalize proper adjectives.B. THE USE OF END MARKS14.The period follows a declarative sentence.15.The period follows an imperative s...mtence.16.The period follows an abbreviation.17.The period follows initials. 299297 - 18.The question mark follows an interrogative sentence.19.The exclamation point follows an interjection or an exclamatorysentence.C. TIE USE OF THE COMMA20.in addresses21.In dates22.After the initial words yes and .o23.To separate too from the rest of the sentence24.To separate a name in direct address25.To set off an appositive from the rest of the sentenceThe Bunker Hill Monument, one of Boiton's historicalsites, is over two hundred feet high.Note:If an appositive is a single word, the comma may be omitted: .fAendFrank26.To set off parenthetical expressionsHe was, to say the least, greatly disturbed.As usual, of course, she was late.2To follow the first clause in a compound or complex sentenceAlthough the tree appeared delicate, it withstood the ravagesof the hurricane.Note:If the sentence is short, the comma is usually omitted.Sit down while I get the tea.28.To separate nonrestrictive words, phrases, and clauses from thewords they modifyTwo strange gentlemen, suspicious and frighteningA scream, somewhere IL the building, aroused the tenants.29.To separate the parts in a series of words, phrases, or clauses 3002a8 74.

THE USE OF THE NEWSPAPER IN THE STUDY OF COMPOSITIONBackgroundThe use of the daily newspaper in the classroom can be a most effective way for the teacher and students to implement many of the phases of composition study.The newspaper is ideally suited for this purpose because of its broad applicabilityand its timeliness.It may well furnish the transition between the student's homeenvironment and the classroom and serve as a motivational factor in that it speaksof the human experience with which the student is familiar.From an academic standpoint the newspaper contains most of the literary formsin use today. Many fine examples of description, narration, and elementary per- suasion may readily be culled from its pages. The student may use these sources to better understand the forms of composition and to improve his skills of ox glnization and expression.Some of the many ways that the newspaper can be used in the classroom followThe student should:develop critical thinking.understand the sequence of eventsincrease word powerlearn to write objectivelydi.velop basic researchunderstand literary types such as poetry, essay, short story,narrative, and descriptionimprove speaking skills through the use of editorial content fordiscussion activitiesincreaP- understanding of the denotation and connotation of wordsdiscover the various nuances of meaning Out words haveimprove listening skillsstudy propaganda devices such as name calling, glittering general-ities, distortion, innuendo, etc.study clicksstudy different levels of usage of words 9093011: study skillful use of figures of speech such as simile and metaphorstudy main ideas through the use of headlines and subheadsmake titles for picturesuse pictures and photographs for practice in observation and inthe writing of descriptive and narrative paragraphsuse cartoons a.Idea stimulatorspractice outlining through the use of book reviews and news storiesuse news stories as the basis for creative writinguse the \"Letters to the Editor\" column as a basis for the study ofletter writingwrite letters to the newspaper in response to some of the printedletterswrite letters applying for a job in response to a classified advert-isementcollect and study samples of effective writing. 304302 SUGGESTED TEXTS FOR COMPOSITION ADVENTURES IN LITERATURE SERIES Classic Ed.(Har.
