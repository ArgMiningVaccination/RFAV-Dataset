The detoxification diet is different. See how it builds good habits to keep weight away!", "sitename": "Dr. Lam Coaching - World Renowned Authority on Adrenal Fatigue Recovery", "date": "2019-06-27", "cleaned_text": "It has taken you years to accumulate the unwanted weight. You want to lose fat, not water or protein. Give yourself 12 months to lose it. That is the only proper way to conduct a detoxification diet for weight management without unhealthy side effects and have the weight stay off for good. 98% of diets fail because of insufficient time for the body to lose fat. Crash diets lead to water loss, and as soon as the diet finishes, rebound weight gain is the norm. This yo-yo effect is very detrimental to the body and definitely what you do not want to have. If you are looking for a crash course, and we know that the vast majority of crash diet courses fail in the long run, then this is not the plan for you. The detoxification diet approach to weight control is gradual and dietetically sound; you can eat regular meals daily for months and lose weight without even realizing it. You don't have to count calories. You will loose weight - about 1/2 pound a week. You will also feel a lot better and healthier for the rest of your life - which is what counts ! A sound anti-aging detoxification diet plan must address three important issues: detoxification of the body, prevention of oxidative stress, and maintaining a low sugar environment. 1 in 10,000 people have the longevity gene that makes then centenarians (living to 100 years old). The rest of us have to get there through a carefully planned anti-aging program. You take in 2 pounds of food a day, and over 20 tons over a lifetime. You are what you eat. Let us embark on the right plan slowly that is clinically proven successful, not one with high expectations that causes your body more harm than good. Its the end result that counts! The desire to eat is a signal from the brain that is activated by your stomach. When you body is clean and aligned, the signal to overeat is not released and you therefore will not feel hungry. This plan detoxifies and trims your body at the same time, without sacrificing nutrition. As you gradually reducing your [sound anti-aging detoxification diet plan](/adrenal-fatigue/diet/), your body is internally cleansed and realigning itself to a new healthy environment. The key to success in this detoxification diet system is the commitment for 12 months if you are not used to healthy living. Why 12 months? Because it takes time to change. Research has shown that at least 21 continuous days of new habit is needed for maximum effect. If you are already following parts of the protocol, or if you are highly motivated, you can shorten the time period from 1 month to 2 to 3 weeks per step, and the entire protocol can be shortened to 6 months. Many have taken it with miraculous results. You can do it too! Losing weight is simple in this plan! Each month, follow the specific action plans just for that month. There are a few small and easy to achieve goals to work on each month. Just follow instructions and before you know it, you will look and feel great. Don't forget that success is 90% mental and 10% physical. Follow these guidelines for your Detoxification Diet in month 1 Longevity is your ultimate goal. Properly sticking to the detoxification diet is an important part of this journey. This Month's Goals Week 1 onward: Cut your sweet tooth by \u00bd and change to diet drink \u00bd the time. Week 2 onward: Make sure your [water intake is 6 glasses](/blog/water/) a day. Week 3 onward: Cut down 1 cup of coffee, tea or cola beverages. Sugar decreases your immune system, plus it adds calories to your diet with no additional benefits in nutrients. For this first month of your adventure to detoxification, you should try to watch your sugar intake in the form of desserts, ice cream, cookies, cakes, and pies. Also, you may be adding sugar in your coffee or tea, so beware, [use sugar substitute instead](/blog/healthy-sweeteners-vs-artificial-sweeteners/). Soft drink is another item that can easily add calorie to your diet. Change to use \"DIET\" drinks. Chocolates and candies will definitely add calories. Try for 2-3 days eating without having any sugar added items. Caffeine has many pharmacological actions in the body, including excitation of the nerves followed by a sort of paralysis or depression. It is also known to have widespread interference in various enzyme systems, damage to the chromosomes of the sex cells and other body cells. Thereby it increases risk of heart disease, cancer, diabetes, and hypertension. So it would be greatly beneficial if you can decrease your coffee, tea, or cola beverages but increase your water intake. Coffee and tea are diuretic, so for every cup of coffee or tea you drink, drink an additional cup of water. This is a small step forward, but a very important step. You are starting your path to a better life. You won't regret your choice. Follow these guidelines for your Detoxification Diet in month 2 Congratulations for passing the first month, which is the hardest. Don't feel guilty if you slip up here and there. The fun part of being human is that you are allowed to make mistakes. If you did not make any meaningful attempt at all last month, you still have this month to get committed and catch up. This Month's Goals Week 1 onward: Cut off most of your desserts and candies. Week 2 onward: Switch from Whole Milk to Low Fat Milk. Week 3 onward: Increase water intake to 7 glasses a day. Cut down an additional cup of coffee, tea or cola beverages if you are taking it. Switching from whole milk to low fat milk will help you cut down 40 calories per cup of milk you drink. Again this will help with some weight loss, and you don't even have to work hard on it. Water is a key part of any detoxification and weight loss program. It is very necessary for helping the body remove fat, and for general overall health. Water will help you to suppress appetite. It will also reduce fat deposits in the body, relieves fluid retention problems, maintains proper muscle tone, rids your body of wastes and toxins, and relieves constipation. Goals from Previous month to be continued Follow these guidelines for your Detoxification Diet in month 3 By now, your body is starting to get used to a low sugar environment. Congratulation! Your immune system thanks you. If you still have problem, don't get discouraged. Keep working on it. It's not too late! Make a commitment to follow instructions. This Month's Goals Week 1 onward: change to whipped butter. Use flax oil, extra virgin olive oil on your salads. Do not heat oil using high heat. Avoid fried food Week 2 onward: change to use low calorie salad dressings Week 3 onward: Increase water intake to 8 glasses a day High fats in the diet increase cholesterols and triglycerides in the blood. These in turn form plaque deposits in the blood vessel, which will eventually block the vessels and cause heart attack, or hypertension. High fat diet is associated with cancer also. Pay attention to where you have applied fats in your diet. Salad dressings, butter or margarine on bread or potato, sour cream, cream cheese. Do you know that each pat of butter or each tablespoon of salad dressing equal to 45 calories? Use instead: low calorie salad dressing, low sugar jam or jelly on bread, low fat ranch dressing on baked potato, non-fat milk on cream soup, etc. Substituting whole milk with low fat milk certainly has helped you cut down your fat intake last month. So keep that up. You should be getting used to the taste by now. So for your salads and breads this month, use low calorie salad dressing and low calorie butter or margarine. Margarine is a type of trans fat which is harmful to the body. Trans fat is commonly used in cakes, donuts, fast foods, and fried foods. A high intake of trans fat has therefore been linked to a variety of free radical diseases such as cancer and heart disease. Trans fat also increases the level of triglyceride and LDL cholesterol. More significantly, trans fat reduces the level of \"good\" HDL cholesterol that often related to the lower risk of cardiovascular diseases. Again, keep working on decreasing your coffee, tea or cola beverages. Remember, caffeine is a big factor in promoting the aging process. Goals from Previous months to be continued ** New goals from last month. Follow these guidelines for your Detoxification Diet in month 4 Don't you feel lighter already with no sugar and less fat in your diet! If you are still struggling with the fats, don't give up. At least now, you are conscious of what you are eating. So keep working on changing the kinds of salad dressings, butter or margarine you use. Use clear broth instead of cream soup. Avoid fried food and Fast Food Restaurants. It is ok to treat yourself to a small dessert just once this month. This Month's Goals Week 1 onward: Cut off processed meats Week 2 onward: Increase your vegetables intake, include a salad for lunch and dinner. Week 3 onward: Include at least 1 cup of cooked vegetables with your lunch or dinner. Week 4 onward: Cut down on snacks and between meal eating Processed meats such as hot dogs, bologna, salami, pastrami, turkey or chicken are both high in fats and salt. They are harmful for those of you that have hypertension, heart disease, diabetes and cancer. Leave these items off your diet to protect your heart and your blood vessels. You can use tuna, grilled chicken breast, salmon or vegetables for your sandwiches. The highest amounts of antioxidants are found in vegetables and fruits. You should include salad (use Romaine, Green or Red Leaf lettuce) with your lunches, and 1 cup cooked vegetables with your dinner. Snack foods are generally high in calories, salt, sugar and fat but have not much nutritional values. If you feel hungry in between meal, it is better to reach for a glass of water than a bag of potato chips. No eating between meals also allows the stomach to rest. Goals from Previous months to be continued ** New goals from last month. Follow these guidelines for your Detoxification Diet in month 5 If you have cut off most sugar, fats, whole milk, processed meats and caffeine from your diet, your body is cleansed and detoxified. It took a lot of will power to do that. Give yourself a pat on your back for reaching almost the half way mark. If you are not where you want to be, use this month to catch up. Whatever you do, don't give up. This Month's Goals Week 1 onward: Decrease red meat intake by \u00bd other than fish. Week 2 onward: Increase your fruit intake to at least 2 servings or pieces a day. Decrease your meat intake is a big project. This means pork, beef, chicken, lamb and fish. A high meat diet means an increase of fat in your diet. And you have learned what fats do to your blood vessel. Cut down your meat intake by half, they should occupy only \u00bc of your plate. Fill your plate with vegetables and potatoes or noodles or whole grain products. For your information, 1 small drumstick has the same calories as two slices of bread or one cup of pasta or one cup of rice. Which would make you feel full? So cutting down on meat eating will also help you lose weight. And that is what you want to do for Anti-Aging: LOSE WEIGHT! If you are used to eating meat everyday, this may be a difficult month. Instead of cutting meat intake by 50%, try cutting by 25%. Goals from Previous months to be continued ** New goals from last month. Follow these guidelines for your Detoxification Diet in month 6 Have you weighed yourself? If not, go weigh yourself now. You should have loss at least 10-20 lbs by now, and maybe more if you had followed the instructions of the last 5 months. You have reached the halfway mark. Your body is detoxified and cleansed. Cellular rejuvenating changes are happening deep inside your body, even if you may not see it outwardly. This Month's Goals Use whole grain products instead of products made with white flour. Also eliminate milk. Whole grain products, vegetables and fruits increase the fiber content in your diet. As a result there is an increase in fecal bulk, decrease in intestinal transit time, so the risk of colon cancer is lowered. It delays gastric emptying - you won't be as hungry and can control food intake and weight. Lastly, fiber slows down glucose absorption therefore the blood glucose level will be kept constant. Fiber found in oats and fruits also lowers serum cholesterol, which decrease risk to hypertension, heart disease, cancer and diabetes. Goals from Previous months to be continued ** New goals from last month. Follow these guidelines for your Detoxification Diet in month 7 You are half way through to a lifestyle change. You have come a long way, making major changes in your diet and lifestyle. Your effort toward detoxification and anti-aging is shown by weight loss, a younger look and feel. Don't get discouraged if you are not exactly where you want to be or if you have not followed the instructions to the letter. If the changes seem overwhelming, don't worry. With each meal and each day comes a new opportunity to restart. Don't feel guilty. Just keep trekking ahead. There is no turning back! This Month's Goals Reduce dairy products, such as milk, cheese, and yogurt. Dairy products are a source of fat that can increase your serum cholesterol. Many people, particularly Asians and Africans, are unable to digest the milk sugar lactose; this can result in diarrhea and gas. Dairy products are linked to ovarian cancer, cataracts, Insulin-dependent diabetes, iron deficiency and childhood leukemia. It is also one the most common causes of food allergies. Contrary to common beliefs, dairy products do not stop osteoporosis. You can use nut milk, soybean milk, rice milk or oat milk. Goals from Previous months to be continued ** New goals from last month. Follow these guidelines for your Detoxification Diet in month 8 You should be very proud of your accomplishments. You have made changes in your lifestyle and cause your body to be younger, even though you may not see it. If you really have craving for those foods that you have left behind in the past 7 months, celebrate your success this month by giving yourself a small indulgence. You don't need to feel guilty every time you feel like eating a candy or a piece of steak. Remember the big key to longevity is eat small quantity and in moderation. Let's review what you have done. First, you have taken off sugar and visible fats from your diet, so your heart thanks you. You have also increased the usage of whole grain products, vegetables and fruits. Your digestive system, heart and muscle thank you. Vegetables and fruits are the best anti-oxidants you can find. You have cut down on your caffeine intake, your nervous system and brain thank you. You have increase the intake of water, your kidney and muscle thank you. There are no new actions for this month. Continue to refine your taste buds by continuing with the new habits. Goals from Previous months to be continued ** New goals from last month. Follow these guidelines for your Detoxification Diet in month 9 By eliminating many fatty and sweet foods from your diet, your body automatically slows down and adjusts itself to a lower food intake regiment. This is where the anti-aging effect kicks in, and less energy burned by the body means less wear and tear on the organs. It is not unusual to have lost about 20- 30 pounds by now. You are getting closer to your goal. If you feel discourage, just remember that there is always tomorrow to start over again. Eat 6 small meals per day, rather than the traditional 3 square meals. In this way, you will maintain a [balance in your blood sugar](/adrenal-fatigue/symptoms/hypoglycemia/) and the level of nutrients in your body throughout the day, so that your blood vessels maintain the elasticity as in the young. This Month's Goals Increase more vegetables intake. Try to eat up to 2-4 cups of cooked vegetables. One of the vegetables during the day should be green leafy vegetable. Goals from Previous months to be continued ** New goals from last month. Follow these guidelines for your Detoxification Diet in month 10 You know, this new way of detoxification and eating is part of a lifestyle for anti-aging. It is beneficial for you and your whole family. It helps you to feel better over all whether you are young or old. So be excited and work on getting younger with your love ones. Give them the ultimate gift - the gift of life! This Month's Goal Decrease your alcoholic beverages. Many physicians and pharmacologists consider alcohol a poison. [Alcohol injures every cells it touches](https://www.cdc.gov/alcohol/fact-sheets/alcohol-use.htm), causes a reduction in muscular coordination, mental activity, and an impairment of judgment. Alcohol also injures the heart, the digestive system, and increase risk of certain cancer. It is imperative that you cut down on your alcohol intake as part of your anti-aging program. Goals from Previous months to be continued ** New goals from last month. Follow these guidelines for your Detoxification Diet in month 11 You are almost at the end of the journey to longer and better living. You have made major lifestyle changes toward detoxification, longevity and been able to maintain a healthier life. Remember the hard works you have put in these last 10 months, so don't throw the effort away. Continue to keep these changes all your life. You can treat yourself to some favorite foods occasionally but just watch the portion sizes. Remember to persist and stay with your new lifestyle. Eat in moderation. This Month's Goal Cut off red meat products in dinner meals; use more fish and chicken. You can also substitute using nuts, seeds, and legumes. Allow red meat only 1 day a month. The ideal anti-aging detoxification diet is a Modified Mediterranean diet. You can easily achieve it by following my Anti-aging Food Choice Pyramid. You do not have to be a total vegetarian to live longer by following this detox and trim diet plan. Goals from Previous months to be continued ** New goals from last month. Congratulations! You have made lots of changes in your lifestyle. You have come a long way. Give yourself a pat on the back. This is the last month of your tough and hard journey to better living. As you graduate, remember what you have learned here, continue to live it and pass on to your loved ones the same good habits. You can probably see now that detox and trim anti-aging diet really reflects a lifestyle change for a better, healthier, and happier life. There are no losers. Do not compare with others. Success is knowing that you are making progress. If you have not yet reached your goal, continue on. This Month's Goal Cut off red meat for the lunch meals, substitutes using fish, chicken, nuts, seeds, or legumes. Goals from Previous months to be continued ** New goals from last month. Now that you have been detoxified, choose your food wisely by following the Anti-aging Food Choice Pyramid from now on. It depends on how severe is your AFS. The early stages of AFS may tolerate detox wraps better than the advanced stages. If you are already quite weak, detox wrap can trigger adrenal crashes. When you are healthy, it is always good to do fasting and detoxification. The frequency of how often too fast or detox depends on your lifestyle. If you follow a good diet, take nourishments, live in a clean environment, I don't think you need to detox more than twice a year. "}
