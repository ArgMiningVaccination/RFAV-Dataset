Kathleen A. Cronin, Ph.D. New Mexico State University Abstract This paper reviews characteristics of autism spect rum disorders (ASD), possible causes of ASD, current demographic information, the effects on th e individual with ASD and the family, as well as diversity and multicultural issues related to autism. Additionally, the paper provides pertinent information about students with ASD for both ge neral education and special education teachers including a review of special education laws, pedagogical strate gies, the individual education plan (IEP), the use of behavior plans, accomm odations and modifica tions appropriate for students on the autism spectrum, assistive technology, and professional development. Definition of Autism The modern concept of autism was first introduced as \"autistic dist urbances of affective contact\" in 1943 by Leo Kanner (Kanner, 1943, p. 217). He sugge sted that children with autism live in a world of their own, cut off from normal social interactions due to a failure to develop motivation, rather than a regression of so cial interaction. Kanner discu ssed eleven children who were described as rigid, inflexible, r eacting negatively to any change in environment or routine, and a lack of ability to psychologically perceive the social world and make it part of themselves. He also suggested that autism could be influenced and caused by inappropria te parenting (Kanner, 1943). In 1944 Hans Asperger published a paper in Ge rmany in which he described a syndrome he referred to as \"autistic psychopa thy\" (Wing, 1981). He identified four boys who had lack of empathy, little ability to form friendships, cl umsy movements, and one-sided conversations which were of specific interest to them. Th e boys had relatively advanced grammar and vocabulary, but there was something unusual about their ability to have a typical conversation. Asperger also suggested that the disorder is a life-long and stable personality type (Attwood, 2007). Autism, also known as Pervasive Development Disorder (PDD) or autism spectrum disorder (ASD), is a complex developmental disability which typically affects a person's ability to communicate and interact with others. It is a sp ectrum disorder that affects each individual differently and can range from very mild to se vere. Symptoms of ASD may include: not pointing at objects or showing interest, not being able to pretend play, avoiding ey e contact or wanting to be alone, having delayed speech or language skill s, repeating words or phrases over and over (echolalia), obsessive intere sts, getting upset by minor ch anges, having trouble understanding JAASEP WINTER 2014 28 others or own feelings, or stereotyped mannerisms includi ng hand flapping, body rocking, or spinning in circles (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 2012a). Autism is a triad of impairments that typically emerge by the ag e of three and last th roughout a person's life, although symptoms may improve over time with trea tment. The triad consists of impairments in social relationships, social language and communication skills, and restrictive behaviors, interests, and activities (W itwer & Lecavalier, 2008). Autism was considered a form of schizophrenia until the 1970's, when further research proved that children with autism suffer in many other area s of development, and their behavior is very different from the typical schizophrenic (Golds tein & Ozonoff, 2009). Currently, there are five different subgroups that fall under the umbrella of PDD or ASD. They are: autistic disorder, Rett's disorder, childhood disintegrative diso rder, Pervasive Developmental Disorder- Not Otherwise Specified (PDD-NOS), and Asperger's disorder (Goldstein & Ozonoff, 2009). With the adoption of the Diagnostic a nd Statistical Manual 5 (2013), th ere will be one diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder and the five disorders cu rrently under the ASD umbrella will not exist. There is no cure for autism, but with early de tection and intervention you can greatly improve the quality of life of an individual with autism. Diagnosis of Autism Goldstein and Ozonoff (2009) paraphrase the DS M-IV-TR criteria for di agnosis of autistic disorder: To qualify for the diagnosis, a child first must present at least six symptoms, with at least two from the first set of criteria and at le ast one from each of the second and third sets. The first set of criteria features qualitative impairment in social interaction, as manifested by (1) impairment of nonverbal behaviors, including eye contact, facial expression, body postures, and gestures of soci al interaction; (2) failure to develop peer relationships appropriate to the child's developmental level; (3) markedly impaired sharing of emotional states or interests with others; and/or (4) absence of social or emotional reciprocity. The second set of cr iteria refers to qualitativ e impairment in communication, as manifested by (1) a delay or complete ab sence of the development of spoken language, without efforts to compensate through gestur es; (2) obvious impairment in the ability to initiate or sustain conversation, despite ade quate speech; (3) repetitive or stereotyped use of language, or idiosyncratic language; and/or (4) lack of varied, spontaneous make- believe play or social imitati ve play appropriate for the ch ild's developmental level. The third set of criteria involves re petitive and stereotypic patterns of behavior, interests, or activities, including (1) preoccupa tion with a certain pattern of behavior that is abnormal in focus or intensity; compulsive adherence to specific nonfunctional ro rsistent preoccupation with parts of objects\" (p. 7). A screening instrument is a tool used to iden tify infants and children who may be at risk of developmental delays compared to other children of the same age and cultural background. Most screening tools are designed to measure a broa d range of developmental delays, but some are sensitive enough to identify a ch ild who may have an autism spectrum disorder (Hall, 2009). JAASEP WINTER 2014 29 Different screening instruments include Check list for Autism in Toddlers (CHAT), Social Communication Questionnaire (SCQ), Vineland Social-Emo tional Early Childhood Scales (SEEC), and Temperament and Atypical Behavior Scale (TABS). After screening tools identify child ren at risk, a parent or pediat rician will recommend that child for diagnostic assessment. Obtaining multiple so urces, using multiple forms of measurement is considered best practice in the diagnostic pro cess (Hall, 2009). The assess ment process generally includes family interviews, observations of a child 's behavior during stru ctured and unstructured activities, and the clinical judgm ent of a psychologist or psychiat rist who is in charge of the diagnostic process. The instruments used in the diagnostic process may include: Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS), Gilliam Autism Rati ng Scale (GARS), Dia gnostic Interview for Social and Communication Disorders (DISCO), Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R), and Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS). There is still an urgent need for valid and reliable diagnostic instruments that diagnose other disorders u nder the ASD spectrum such as Asperger disorder and PDD-NOS, which may re main unresolved until there is a consensus on how to define these disorders (Hall, 2009). Educators and related service providers such as speech/language pathologists have a number of different assessments they can choose from to pl an educational and inte rvention strategies to help a child learn social, behavi oral, communication, and educationa l aspects they will need to have a better quality of life. They include : Autism Screening Instrument for Educational Planning (ASIEP-2), Psychoeducational Profile (P EP), Adolescent and Adult Psychoeducational Profile (AAPEP), Functional Emotional Assessm ent Scale (FEAS), The McGill Action Planning System, Hawaii Early Learning Profile (HELP ), Assessment, Evaluation, and Programming System (AEPS), Carolina Curriculum for Infant s and Toddlers with Special Needs, Carolina Curriculum for Preschoolers with Special Needs, Creative curriculum, and Assessment of basic Language and Learning Skills (ABLLS ). It is always important to continually monitor and assess children to make sure that the intervention a nd teaching techniques being used are working, and the student is continually making adequate progress. Causes of Autism There is no one single known cause of autism, bu t there are many likely causes for multiple types of ASD. Many people believe it is caused by genetics, others believe it is caused by environmental factors, and some think it is cause d by a combination of the two. One cause that is generally accepted by most is atypical brain function or development (Autism Society, 2012a; Kaufmann & Silverman, 2010). Children with autis m have abnormal timing in the growth of their brains. Studies have shown accelerated growth from birth to 12 months, from an average of 13% smaller at birth, to an average of 10% larger at one year of age, compared to a typically developing child (Vaccarino, Grigorenko, Smith, & St evens, 2009). The cerebellum, in the lower back of the brain, which controls movements and motor function, and plays a role in actions of behavior, cognition, and emotion also tends to be enlarged (Kaufmann & Silverman, 2010). Genetic mutations can also be associated with autism. In some cases spontaneous, or \"de novo,\" mutations arise in a sperm, egg, or very early in embryonic development, possibly altering early brain development (Gilman et al., 2011; Levy et al., 2011; Sanders et al., 2011). Because it is a JAASEP WINTER 2014 30 mutation in the egg, sperm, or embryo, they ar e not present in the ge netic makeup of either parent. Genetic mutations are known as copy numbe r variants (CNVs), which can range from a small deletion in the genetic code to extra copi es of a large DNA sequence. These non-inherited mutations affect genes or gene networks invol ved in brain development (Gilman et al., 2011; Levy et al., 2011; Sanders et al ., 2011). Individuals with gene tic and chromosomal disorders such as Fragile X syndrome, tuberous sclerosi s, Prader-Willi syndrome, and Down's syndrome have a higher risk of developing an ASD, with around 10% of the ASD population identified with a genetic or chromoso mal disorder (CDC, 2012a). Many things can affect an embryo during the gesta tional period which may lead to risk factors for autism. A recent study by Schmidt and co lleagues (2011) shows that mothers who took prenatal vitamins before, during, and after pregna ncy were about half as likely to have a child with an ASD, in particular if the mother or ch ild carries genes that increase susceptibility to autism, compared to women who did not. By analyzing the DNA of mothers and children, researchers found that women who had either one of two gene variants associated with folate regulations had five times the risk of having a child with autism if the mother did not take prenatal vitamins. Children who had one of the ge ne variants had seven times the normal risk of developing ASD if the mother did not take prenat al vitamins, compared to two times the normal risk if she did. This study is part of a larg er project Childhood Autism Risks from Genetics and the Environment (CHARGE) which aims to increase understanding of the causes and contributing factors that lead to ASD (Schmidt et al., 2011). The largest study to directly assess twins with au tism revealed an autism concordance between identical twins at 70 percent, significantly lowe r than the 90 percent rate previously suggested, and around a 35 percent rate in frat ernal twins, with previous studi es showing little to no overlap (Hallmayer et al., 2011). This st udy suggests that environmental risk factors in the womb play a large role in the development of autism, but further research is needed to support that claim. Another study done by Ozonoff et al. (2011), the la rgest study of infant s with one or older siblings with ASD found that the younger si blings have around a 20 percent chance of developing an ASD, with a hi gher rate of around 25 percent am ong baby brothers compared to 11 percent among baby sisters. These findings highlight a need for close monitoring and screening among infants with an older sibling with ASD. The age of both mothers and fathers may also play a role in the development of risk factors associated with ASD. A study by Shelton, Tanc redi, and Hertz-Piccio tto (2010) shows that women over the age of 40 are 77 percent more like ly than women under the age of 25 to have a child with autism, and 51 percent more likely than women aged 25-29. A study by Lundstrom et al. (2010) found that fathers under 25 and over 50 had around a 50 percent chance of having a child with ASD. Parner et al. (2012) found that for mothers under 35 the risk of having a child with ASD increased with the fa ther's age increasing, and for fathers under 35 there was an increased risk with mother's increasing age. Last, but not least, is the role that vaccines play in autism. Thimerisol, a mercury-containing preservative, was used in some pediatric vaccines from the 1930's until 2003, primarily in the DTP, HepB, and Hib vaccines. Oller and Oller (2010) show a direct co rrelation between the JAASEP WINTER 2014 31 rising use of these vaccines and the rising rate of autism in the United States. Some vaccines, such as influenza, and other vaccines for olde r children and adults sti ll use trace amounts of Thimerisol, which the CDC claims is safe (CDC, 2012b). The measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine has also been an area of contro versy, especially after a study by Wakefield et al. (1998) claimed the MMR vaccine caused autism in nine out of twelve children involved. The article has since been retracted and Wakefield's license was revoked due to falsification of data. Further studies, including one by Uchiyama, Kurososawa, and Inaba (2007), have shown no significant link between the MMR vaccine and the cause of autism. Demographics and Effects of Autism Autism awareness has risen in the United States in the past decade through the hard work of parents, autism groups such as Autism Speaks and the Autism Society, celebrities, autism awareness month, autism events an d fund raisers, and increased media attention. The Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring (ADDM) Networ k is a surveillance system that looks at information obtained from eight year olds liv ing within 14 ADDM sites in the United States, evaluates their records to determine the pr esence of ASD symptoms, and estimates the prevalence of ASD (CDC, 2012c). In 2012 the CDC es timated the prevalence of autism at 1 in 88, an increase of 23% when compared to th e 2006 data, and 78% when compared to the 2002 data. They also estimated approximately one in 54 boys, and one in 252 girls has ASD. Autism is a disorder which affects the lives of th e family, as well as the individual who has it. In a world where most communication is done by listening and talking, deficits in verbal communication and auditory processing can cau se an individual with an ASD to be disadvantaged in school, home, and work settings . Difficulties predicting what others are likely to do or think, and what might happen in a given s ituation, puts an individu al with autism in a position where they constantly n eed direction and input from others (Aspy & Grossman, 2008). Difficulties with communication and social skills can also make it hard for a person with autism to obtain a job. Aspects such as job interviews, team work, social conventions such as personal space, and communicating and understanding of work related information all can pose a risk for obtaining and retaining employment (Attwood, 2007). The student's disability can cause them anxiety, stress, and depression, which can furt her hinder their social and communicative interactions with teachers, family members, service providers, and co workers (Bevan-Brown, Carroll-Lind, Kearney, Sperl, & Sutherland, 2008 ; VanBergeijk, Klim, & Volkmar, 2008). It has been hypothesized by Groden and colleagues that \"persons with autism may be even more vulnerable to the effects of stress because they may lack a repertoire of appropriate coping mechanisms\" (as cited in Bevan-Brown et al., 20 08, p. 23). This proves there is a great need to teach individuals with autism different ways to cope and handle their stress and anxiety. Parents of children with autism also deal with hi gh stress levels. In a study done by Pisula (2007) results showed that mothers worry about their ch ildren having to depend on others, the child's future and the permanency of autism, aggr essive and challenging behaviors, lack of communication, and the lack of support for their children and themselves. Parents also feel frustration having to repeatedly explain their children's autis m to others (Bevan-Brown, 2010). Bevan-Brown (2010) teamed up with parents to create a DVD to educate the public about children with autism and their families, and these were predominate messages parents want JAASEP WINTER 2014 32 others to know: ASD is not an illness that can be cured; children with ASD think and act differently, people need to accept and accommodat e these differences, and include and treat children with ASD and their families with dignity and respect. All parents want their children to be accepted by p eers and to have friends to play with. Children with autism have a hard time forming friendshi ps, and their parents know that behaviors their children have can scare off potential friends. Through education and a greater understanding of ASD, and the help of teachers and related pers onnel, it may be possible for children with autism to form friendships, and reduce the amount of stress on them and their family (Bevan-Brown, 2010). Siblings of individual's with autism are also a ffected. There are conflict ing studies as whether having a sibling with autism nega tively or positively affects non- disabled siblings, with some reports showing a higher risk for poor adjustment , and others finding that siblings of children with autism being more likely to be well adju sted (as cited in Macks and Reeve, 2007). A study done by Macks and Reeve (2007) showed that sib lings of children with autism have a more positive self-concept; they were more likely to have a positive view of their behavior, intelligence, scholastic performance, and anxiety; and a more positive view of their overall personal characteristics. This could be due to comparing themselves to the sibling with autism, or to a higher maturity level. The same study report ed that mothers viewed siblings' social and emotional adjustment more negatively, perhaps due to the fact that because they encounter high stress levels, they assume their other children do as well, or the f act that they spend so much time attending to the needs of the child with autism th at they do not have an accurate view of their other children's social and emotional functioning (Macks and Reeve, 2007). Special Education Laws School structures, classroom structures, and how teachers deliver educatio n are all influenced and governed by law. The Education for A ll Handicapped Children Act (EAHCA), which allowed for federal regulation of free public ed ucation for all children with disabilities was introduced in 1975, amended in 1983 and 1986, rena med to the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) in 1990, and was again amended in 1992 and 1997 (McLeskey, Rosenberg, & Westling, 2010; Yen & Mao, 2011) . IDEA was amended again in 2004 and renamed the Individuals with Di sabilities Education Improvement Act (IDEIA). Court cases such as Board of Education of Hendri ck Henson School District v. Rowley (1982), Burlington Sch. Committee v. Mass. Bd. of Ed. (1985), and Honig v. Doe (1988) have helped to improve the special education laws by lead ing to some of the updates and amendments which strengthened the role of parents, encouraged non legal reso lution of disputes, and required students with disabilities to participate in the general e ducation curriculum and st ate and district-wide assessments (McLeskey et al., 2010; Yen & Mao, 2011). Autism was added as a disability under IDEA in 1990 (Moores-Abdool, 2010). Under IDEIA all students with disabilities must be provided with free and appropriate public education (FAPE) which provides appropriate edu cation and related servi ces at no cost to the student or their families, with a zero reject polic y, occurring in the least restrictive environment (LRE) (McLeskey et al., 2010). In a LRE students w ith disabilities should receive services at a JAASEP WINTER 2014 33 location as close as possible to their home, in a classroom with nondisabled peers, with access to the general education curriculum and extracurri cular activities, and removal from the general education classroom occurring only when the severity of the disa bility precludes the satisfactory delivery of education and re lated services (McLeskey et al., 2010). An indi vidualized education program (IEP) is a document that sets the guide lines for the delivery of instruction and what related services the student is eligible for, and is also required by IDEI A. Parents or guardians have the opportunity to partic ipate in IEP meetings and all decisions regarding assessment, identification, placement, and related services for their child. IDEIA requires the student's records to be confidential, with only those involved with the st udent knowing pertinent facts, and parental rights to in spect and review all in formation on their child (McLeskey et al., 2010). The oldest law that protects the ri ghts of individuals based on thei r disability is the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, which was renamed as the Amer icans with Disabilities Act (ADA) in 1990 (VanBergeijk et al., 2008; Yen & Mao, 2011). Sec tion 504 of that act demands federally funded organizations and employers to tr eat disabled and non disabled pe rsons equally. It gives access, without the threat of being denie d, to rehabilitation and training for disabled individuals, and benefits a child with autism by providing special accommodations in school such as extra teacher assistance in class, or specific study areas (McLeskey et al., 2 010; VanBergeijk et al., 2008; Yen & Mao, 2011). The No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB) was intro duced in 2001, and requires compliance to high standards and holds states and schools who do not meet the criteria accountable (McLeskey et al., 2010). Besides strong accountability for inade quate results, NCLB gives expanded flexibility and local control of schools, urges the use of teaching methods based on scientific research, options for parents to transfer students out of low-performing school s with occasional options for supplemental activities, and requi rements for teachers to be hi ghly qualified (McLeskey et al., 2010). With the combination of NCLB and IDEIA, general education teachers are required to adapt their instructional stra tegies to accommodate students with disabilities (Moores-Abdool, 2010). Diversity in Individuals with Autism Autism affects individuals from every walk of li fe, every part of the world, every language, and every culture. Culturally and linguistically divers e (CLD) children face many difficulties when it comes to the understanding and diagnosis of autism. According to Rodriguez (2009): Special educators face a critical need to address and document issues related to family involvement, effective interventi on, and personnel preparation, in order to ensure that all individuals with autism, incl uding CLD students with autism , may gain an education and improve their quality of life (p. 313). ADDM estimates that prevalence among non-Hisp anic white children is higher than among non-Hispanic black children and Hispanic children (CDC, 2012c). CLD students may have a late age diagnosis, or no diagnos is at all due to different points of view regarding ASD symptomology, and what resources are available to them (Mo rrier, Hess, & Heflin, 2008; Ravindran & Myers, 2012). JAASEP WINTER 2014 34 The word autism, or a disability in general, has different meanings and implications across different cultures, and cultural be liefs about cause can influence d ecisions about what treatments to use and what outcomes to expect (Ravindr an & Myers, 2012). Ravindran and Myers (2012) state that \"for the best course of care, professionals need to understand and respect families' views on autism and work toward mutually agreea ble treatments that may involve a combination of biomedical and cultural practices\" (p. 311). An open teamwork, family-focused model which aims to acknowledge the culture of the child, consider s the child's and fam ily's strengths and limitations, and develops an appropriate, sustainable, and sensitive intervention is regarded as best practice, but may take some explanation an d convincing of families fr om different cultures (Ravindran & Myers, 2012). Differe nt cultures have different beliefs about autism; some think it is curable, some cultures try acupuncture, vita min diets, or complementary and alternative medicines. Others believe that autism is cause d by sins the mother or child have committed, or by a curse put on the family, and some believe the individual with autism is a teacher who is here to bring special messages, and they may choose not to treat the symptoms because that would interfere with the delivery of that message (Ravindran & Myers, 2012) . Asking parents with different cultural backgrounds what they believ e caused their child's au tism could help in understanding their choice of treatments and what they believe the outcome will be. Collaboration of School Teams With the high demands for achievement and accountability measures that have been created by IDEIA and NCLB, along with the in creasing diversity of students in schools, it is more important than ever to have effective collaboration be tween principals, teachers, parents, and other professionals that work with students with autism . McLeskey et al., (2010) define collaboration as \"teachers and other professi onals working together to achie ve common goals\" (p. 442). There are several forms of collaborat ion including collaborative teams, a team of professionals who work together to address a range of different type s of issues and concerns; co-teaching, a general and special education teacher wo rking together to share the responsibility for instructing a diverse group of students in a single classr oom; and collaborative consultation, two or more professionals working together to seek solutions to a mutually agreed-upon problem or issue (McLeskey et al., 2010). Professiona ls working together need to be flexible and develop trust and respect. A child with autism has many needs and several professionals are involved in meeting those needs including, but not limited to, general e ducation teachers, special education teachers, speech-language pathologists (SLP), physical ther apists (PT), occupational therapists (OT), psychologists, and of course the parents, who know the child best. All of these people need to work together to create successful learning oppo rtunities and intervention s to help the student learn, grow, and succeed. Lamont (2008) suggests for a collaborative team to be successful there should be an established equality between all team members; a shared language base for all discussions, so all team members understand what is being discussed; disc iplined listening which involves no one team member immediately resp onding with suggestions on how to solve a problem, rather a discussion invol ving questions and suggestions from all team members, which allows a climate of trust and mutual respect; removing barriers to engagement; and creating a shared responsibility for problem solving. JAASEP WINTER 2014 35 Pedagogical Strategies There are many different techniques an educator can use to effectively integrate and educate a student with PDD-NOS or another ASD. First and foremost it is important to get to know your student, and gain their trust and respect. Teacher s will have a difficult time gaining trust and respect from their students and their families if they talk negatively about their students, whether in a public, private, or school setting, it is wrong to cross that ethical boundary . By getting to know students, an educator has a better understand ing of their strengths and weaknesses, and will be able to better teach th em (McLeskey et al., 2010). Drama can be used as a learning medium in whic h a student can explore so cial and moral issues, and engage in investigative problem-solving (Pet er, 2009). Drama can teach students with autism to use narrative form, and in a social context it provides a way to evaluate and engage with cultural meanings. Using narrative form can teach a child with autism a form of social play, or role play, which can provide a way to explor e human experiences, different perspectives, motivations, and intentions and consequences (Peter, 2009). Involving the whole class in rule s, routines, lessons, and progra ms is good for everyone, but is especially beneficial for a student with autis m (Bevan-Brown, 2010). The class as a whole can learn skills such as being a friend, being respec tful, resilience, the ba sic give and take of communication, homework and study strategies, a nd organization strategies, all without the student with autism being singled out, and possibly looked down upon. These routines and structure, and the lessons themselves can help to make the class as a whole run more efficiently and organized. Social narratives can also be used in the classr oom to help students with an ASD acquire and use appropriate social skills. They ar e stories represented visually that describe social situations and appropriate behaviors, and respons es to the situations (Autism Internet Modules [AIM], 2012a). Social narratives can be written by parents or educators, with or without the student, and are designed to promote social unders tanding. They should be written at the student's language and learning levels, and use visuals to promote unders tanding of the content. Social narratives must be taught through direct instruction, and can be us ed after a social error has occurred, before a transition or a new experience, and as an in tervention to reduce existing, unwanted, recurring behaviors (AIM, 2012a). Social narratives can be used to teach students an appropriate way to complete assignments and k eep track of materials. Social narratives are considered an evidence-based practice (E BP) by The National Professional Development Center (NPDC) on AS D (2102a). To be considered an evidence-based practice for individuals with ASD, efficacy must be establis hed through peer-reviewed research in scientific journals using: Randomized or quasi-experimental design stud ies. Two high quality experimental or quasi-experimental design studies Single-subject design studies. Th ree different investigators or research groups must have conducted five high quality sing le subject design studies, or Combination of evidence. One high quality randomized or quasi-experimental group design study and three high quality single s ubject designs studies conducted by at least JAASEP WINTER 2014 36 three different investigators or research groups (across the gro up and single subject design studies) (Retrieved from http://autismpdc.fpg.unc .edu/content/evidence-based- practices). NPDC on ASD has used rigorous cr iteria to identify twenty-four EBPs, which include video modeling, discrete trial training, functional behavi or assessment, peer-mediated instruction and intervention, social skills gr oups, pivotal response training, and picture exchange communication system (PECS) to name a few (NPDC on ASD, 2012a). Peer-Mediated Instruction and In tervention (PMII) teaches typically developi ng peers strategies to interact with, and help indivi duals with an ASD gain desired so cial skills by increasing social opportunities within natural environments, usi ng both teacher-directed and learner-initiated activities (NPDC on ASD, 2012b). PMII targeted so cial skills include responding to peers, understanding peers, reciprocity, an d interacting with peers. A PM II could be used when students are transitioning to a new classroom or a different school to help peers in the new setting become familiar and comfortable with the student, and to get him/her familiar and comfortable with them, as well as teach appropriate social skills and techniques. It is important for a student with autism to ha ve structure and routines in lessons and learning environments. Educators can achieve this by preparing students for new content by sending home unit and lesson summaries before they start, using visual organizers , using nonverbal cues to prompt attention to important information, and step by step modeling of behaviors or activities such as completing assignments, just to name a few (McLeskey et al., 2010). Other strategies that are good to use with children with autism ar e: incorporating intere sts; providing breaks to avoid over stimulation; informing peers and supporting, encouraging, and fostering social relationships; preparing for transitions; focus on using strengths; and proactive crisis support planning (Bevan-Brown, 2010). Behavior Intervention Plans Behavior difficulties can have widespread im pact for a student with autism, and can also negatively affect people who car e for them including family and educational support members (Grossman and Aspy, 2011). A functional behavior asse ssment (FBA) is a careful analysis of the antecedents, the events before a specific behavior, the behavior itself, and the consequences or what happened as a result of the behavior (the ABCs), which all provide insight into the function or the purpose of the behavior. An operational defi nition of the behavior is the first step in an FBA; this is an agreed upon definition of th e behavior in observable and measurable terms (Grossman and Aspy, 2011). Once you have an operational definition, information can be collected through observation and in terviews, or other techniques to determine what is triggering the behavior, and what function it serves. Some functions of behavior could include: escape or avoidance, seeking attention, sensory stimulation, access to materials or rewards, or access to a preferred activity. An FBA can provide a more precise road map fo r the design and implementation of a behavior intervention plan (BIP). McLeskey et al., ( 2010) characterize a successful BIP by: (1) the simultaneous strengthening and reducing of targeted behavior s through the application of JAASEP WINTER 2014 37 behavioral techniques, (2) direct teaching of social skills, (3 ) emphasis on self-management and self-control, and (4) goals of st udent independence (p. 368). Proact ive interventions also address the underlying needs of a student, and not just the surface behaviors seen. Interventions can occur at all three points of the ABCs. The Intervention Ziggurat (IZ) is a model which f acilitates the development of an individualized comprehensive intervention plan to address spec ific behavioral needs and global interventions (Aspy and Grossman, 2008). The IZ incorporates five cri tical levels, structured in a hierarchy: Sensory Differences and Biologica l Needs (addresses basic intern al factors that impact all functioning), Reinforcement address the motivational needs required for skill development; Structures and Visual/Tactile Supports, draws on the strength of visual processing and addresses the need for order and routine th at is fundamental to individua ls with autism; Task Demands, understanding expectations in light of the characteristics of indivi duals with autism; and Skills to Teach, which targets appropriate skills to devel op. An intervention plan is considered to be comprehensive or complete when intervention oc curs (a) on all of the five levels described above, (b) addresses underlying characteristics, and (c) includes antecedent, behavior, and consequence strategies (Aspy and Grossman, 2008). Communication and Language As stated in the DSM-IV-TR (2000) one of the core deficits in autism is impaired communication, both verbal and non ve rbal, with levels of severity varying considerably. This shows that children with an ASD may have diffi culty in acquiring speech and language, as well as difficulty understanding and using nonverbal behavior in communi cation interactions. Language impairments can range from a failure to develop any type of functional speech, to having idiosyncratic and spontaneous speech an d language (National Research Council (NRC), 2001). Joint attention and symbol use are two core communication deficits in individuals with autism. Joint attention is more complex than two or mo re people looking at the same object; it includes synchronization and understanding between the part icipants by coordina ting attention between an object and each other (Murray, Creaghead, Manning-Courtney, Shear, Bean, & Preneville, 2008). Joint attention typically emer ges between 6 and 12 months of age, and is well established by 18 months. It starts by simple gestures such as gazing or pointing, and as the child grows and develops verbal skills, it transf orms from gestures to a more verbal establishment of joint attention (Murray, et al., 2008). Individuals with autism have difficulties in joint attention and gaze following, following the head and eye direction of another, and being able to attend to both objects and human cues in the environment. There is a relationship between th e initiation of joint attention a nd both receptive and expressive language, and without the ab ility to realize the attention of focus is shared, there cannot be a realization that a communicative exchange is occurring (Murray et al., 2008). For the mapping of word meanings (matching a word to its meaning or concrete object), it is necessary for an individual to have joint attention and gaze mon itoring, and the lack of these can have a negative impact on language development. A study condu cted by Baron-Cohen, Baldwin, and Crowson (1997) shows that only 29.4% of the children with autism could correctly map a novel word to an JAASEP WINTER 2014 38 object. Joint attention is impaired early in the development of children with autism, which may have a direct link to la nguage deficiencies. Functional play skills (e.g., using objects for what they are meant to be used for) and symbolic or make-believe play skills (e.g., us ing pretend actions with objects) significantly correlate with receptive and expressive language, and children with autism often have a deficit in these play areas, which could lead to defi cits in communication (NRC, 2001) . Children with autism often perform at same level or above in nonsocial constructive play, combin ing objects to create a product, as typical developing ch ildren, but have lower levels of language comprehension and symbolic play. For children with autism who develop more adva nced language skills, an d move past echolalia stages (imitation of speech), pr oblems with the grammatical asp ects of language, such as the social rules and the give and ta ke of conversation, often arise. These children may also use challenging behaviors such as se lf injury and aggression to get attention, and need to be considered relative to the child's ability in verbal and nonverbal comm unication levels, and may reflect limitations in their symbolic capacity (NRC, 2001). With deficits in language skills there may also be deficits in reading and writing. Children with ASDs often do well at spelling and decoding, but have difficulty with language and reading comprehension (Whalon, Otaiba, & Delano, 2009). NCLB and IDEIA mandate that all children, including children with ASD, be provided with ev idence-based reading instruction that includes five essential components of reading: phone mic awareness, phonics, reading fluency, vocabulary, and comprehension stra tegies; very little research has been done on interventions focused on these components of reading (Whal on et al., 2009). The National Reading Panel, a national panel convened by congress to assess the effectiveness of different approaches used to teach children to read, suggests grouping these into two broader sets of ski lls: code-focused skills (phonological awareness, phonics, and fluency; re quired to accurately and fluently identify words) and meaning-focused skills (vocabulary and comprehension; required for comprehending language in oral and written form). Social Impairments One of the main impairments of autism is deficits in social skills. The DSM-IV-TR (American Psychiatric Association, 2000) se ts the diagnostic criteria for social impairments as follows: 1) Qualitative impairment in social interaction, as manife sted by at least two of the following: a) Marked impairment in the use of multiple nonverbal behaviors such as eye-to- eye gaze, facial expression, body postures, and gestures to regulate social interaction b) Failure to develop peer relationshi ps appropriate to developmental level c) A lack of spontaneous seeking to shar e enjoyment, interest s, or achievements with other people (e.g., by lack of showi ng, bringing, or pointing out objects of interest) d) A lack of social or em otional reciprocity (p. 75) JAASEP WINTER 2014 39 Children with autism often do not have theory of mind (TOM), the abil ity to impute mental states to oneself and others, have poor executive functions (EF) which are higher order cognitive processes that guide purposeful , goal-directed behavior, such as planning, flexibility, and inhibition, and weak central coherence (CC) where the focus is on individual or local elements rather than the whole, which lead to soci al impairments (Pellicano, 2010a; Pellicano, 2010b; & McWhinnie, 2009). Social na rratives, social ski lls groups, pivotal response training, and video modeli ng are all good interventions to use to target development of social skills (NPDC on ASD, 2012c). Accommodations and Modifications Accommodations are used to help a student with autism facilitate learning, and to achieve and demonstrate the same standards required of th eir non-disabled peers (M cLeskey et al., 2010). A visual support is a stimulus th at can help a student comprehend information or demands, and can help children with difficulties in behaviors, attention, organization, sequencing, and auditory processing (Dettmer, Simpson, Myles & Ganz, 2000) . Visual supports can be especially beneficial to students who need extra assi stance with organizati on, communication, social interaction, behavior management, and academic skill s, all of which are areas that students with autism have deficits in (Breitfelder, 2008). Visu al schedules are accomm odations that create positive routines; promote flexibility and adapta bility to change; calmly, purposefully, and independently move students through physical sp aces, from one activity to the next; provide predictability by clearly showing what activit ies will occur in what order; and can be individualized and designed to grow with th e student (Breitfelder, 2008; Hume & Scheuermann, 2008). A work system is another visual accommodation that can be used with children with autism. A work system is designed to give the student a systematic strategy to approach work that needs to be completed, as well as promotes independence, and enables a student to generalize skills into other environments (Breitfelde r, 2008; Scheuermann, A good work system should an swer four questions: How much am I to do? What (and in what order) am I to do? How will I know when I am finished? What happens when I am finished? (Webber & Scheuermann, 2008) . The concept of the word \"finished\" is an organizer, and a key motivator to keep the student on task. Types of work systems include left to right, up/down, matching, and writ ten, which can be manipulated by moving activities, matching symbols to activities, and readi ng a list of activities (Hume & Schopler, 2007; Webber & Scheuermann, 2008). Accommodations in instruction can include listening to audi o books, using word processing software with spell checkers, le arning and applying learning strate gies, using laptops, scribes, or tape recorders for note taking, or having a copy of lecture notes in advance to review and use during class (McLeskey et al., 2010 ; VanBergeijk et al., 2008). St udents with autism often times need help with organizational skills. This can be done by teaching the student to use color coded folders or binders, with each class having a diffe rent color, or by using subdivided folders and binders (VanBergeijk et al., 2008). With higher functioning students, orga nization can also be taught with written instructions paired with pi cture examples. When doing large assignments, a student with autism would benefit from having the assignment broken down in to smaller JAASEP WINTER 2014 40 assignments, with dates to remind the student to start sections, and da tes when each smaller section is due (VanBergeijk et al, 2008). Testing accommodations can be used for class tests or end-of-class assessments, and can included some one reading the test aloud to the student, providing extra time to take the te st, stereo headphones for the stude nt to wear to block out noise distractions, or providing a sepa rate quiet location, free from distractions (McLeskey, et al., 2010; VanBergeijk et al., 2008). Even with educators providing accommodations it is not always reasonable to expect students with autism to master the same general cu rriculum objectives as other students, and modifications to the curriculum can be made on an individualized basi s (McLeskey et al., 2010). In these cases participation in an alternate-assessment program may be written into a student's IEP, in which \"the student will demonstrate skill s parallel to those of same-grade peers but qualitatively different in nature\" (McLeskey et al., 2010, p. 255). This can be done by linking or aligning the standards for students with autism to the general curricu lum, with different requirements for performance that are still ba sed on grade-level standards (McLeskey et al., 2010). Assistive Technology McLeskey and colleagues (2010) define assis tive technology (AT) as \"technology that helps individuals with disabilities functi on more like those wit hout disabilities by he lping to bridge the gap between what a person can do and what he or she may need to do\" (p. 441). Under IDEA 2004 all students eligible for special education ha ve a legal right to be considered for an AT device, which is defined as any item, piece of equipment, or product system, whether acquired commercially of the shelf, modifie d, or customized, that is used to increase, maintain, or improve functional capabilities of a child with a disability and related AT services that directly assists a child with a disability in the se lection, acquisition, or use of an assistive technology device, if they will aid the child in reaching their IEP goals (IDEA 2004, Section 602; McLeskey et al., 2010). There is a wide variety of AT devices that help students with almost anything they need. There are AT devices for specific e ducational subjects such as reading, writing, spelling, and math; devices to help with deficits in communication; pe rsonal digital assistants that help students with various routines such as appoi ntment calendars, reading e-mails , or listening to digital books; devices to help students learn social skills such appropriate gr eetings and recognizing emotions; and devices that can help with daily living needs such as wheelchairs for mobility, or adaptive eating utensils and toothbrushes (Ash, 2009; McLeskey et al., 2010). A student with autism can benefit from a dditional classroom supports which may include sending a study guide home two weeks prior to each test, emailing assignments to the family or placing them on a teacher's web page, providing books on tape for the student to listen as he/she reads the book, or a daily communication log or calendar. Other assistive technology for students with ASD may include an electronic organizer fo r the teachers to record voice directions for assignments, as well as using multimedia or Powe rPoint lectures to hold their attention during instruction. JAASEP WINTER 2014 41 The IEP Once a student has been identified as having a disabi lity an IEP is created to inform educators of that student's disability, streng ths and weaknesses, and to guide the delivery of instruction and related services. McLeskey and colleagues (2010) states that according to IDEIA an IEP must include: 1. A statement of the student's present level of educational achievement and functional performance, 2. A statement of measurable annual goals and, for students evaluated through alternate assessments, benchmarks, or short-term objectives, 3. A statement of the special education and related services and supplementary aids and services that teachers will provide to the ch ild, 4. An explanation of the extent, if any, to which the child will not particip ate with nondisabled children in the general education classroom and in other school activ ities, 5. A statement about the child's participation in state- or district-wide assessments of student achiev ement, 6. The projected dates for beginning services and modifications, and 7. A statemen t of how educators will measure the child's progress toward the annual goals described in item 2 and how the child's parents will be regularly informed (p. 249-250). An IEP team should consist of the parents or gu ardians; a general education teacher; a special education teacher; a school dist rict representative who knows a bout available service-delivery options, programs, the general education curriculum, and related-service availability; a specialist who can evaluate and interpret assessments and th e instructional implications; other individuals who have knowledge or special expertise about th e child including relate d service providers, lawyers, or advocates; and when appropria te, the student (McL eskey et al., 2010). Current Issues in ASD With the rising number of people being diagnosed with ASD, there is a vast amount of research being done to better understand the causes, and to find the best methods of treatment. Along with the increase in diagnosis, there is a demand for qualified teachers and therapists to work with students with autism, and a great push for early diagnosis and intervention. Groups such as the Autism Research Institute, Autism Society, and Au tism Speaks are some of the largest donors for autism research, including environmental factors, genetic factors, biomedical advancement, and treatment (Autism Research Institute, 2012; Autism Society, 2012b; Autism Speaks, 2012a). With advances being made in technology, there are a variety of technologies that can be used in therapy to obtain new skills, or to modify or eliminate behaviors. There are a huge number of people that have access to iPhones, iPads, iPods, and Android phones and tablets, and there are a growing number of apps being created to us e on them. Autism Speaks (2012b) has compiled a list of autism apps; it has the name of the app, what device it works on, what category it covers (e.g., communication, language, or organi zation), and how much it costs. Social media can also be used to raise autism awareness, and to help parents and families find resources in their area. Right now both Autism Speaks and the Autism Society are using outlets such as Facebook and Twitter to urge elected official s to address the rising prevalence of autism, JAASEP WINTER 2014 42 how they would support autism research, and include autism in the Affordable Care Act (Autism Society, 2012c; Autism Speaks, 2012c). Professional Development With the growing number of students being di agnosed with autism, and the vast amounts of research being done on autism and its causes, ne w interventions being developed, and current evidence based practices, it is imperative for professi onals to keep up to date with all of the new information to successfully teach students with AS D in their classrooms. NCLB requires states to give educators high quality professional deve lopment which should be evaluated to ensure mastery of the content and whether it has a posi tive impact on teacher effectiveness; educators and professionals who lack the necessary trai ning to work with students with autism may struggle to deliver effective instruction or effec tively manage behaviors (Bellini, Henry, & Pratt, 2011; Borko, 2004). Successful inclusion requires an educator to prepare for a student with autism before the student enters their class, and many teachers feel that they were inadequately prepared to work with students who have special n eeds, especially students with autism, so it is even more important for these teachers to have additional professional development (Berger, 2011; Moores-Abdool, 2010). Professional developmen t can come in the form of external workshops or in-service training, and can lead to improvement in instructional practices and student learning (Bellini et al., 2011; Borko, 2004). Autism Internet Modules (2012b) is an internet site designed to provi de professionals and parents up-to-date information needed to help in dividuals with ASD reach their highest potential. They offer a series of online learning modul es that include information on assessment and identification of ASDs, recognizing and unders tanding of behaviors a nd characteristics, transition into adulthood, employment, and seve ral evidence-based practi ces and interventions. All module content has been written by experts in the field of autism from across the United States, has been designed according to research on how adults learn, is presented at a universal reading level, and have interactive activities th at reinforce knowledge and teaches how to make current research applicable to real life (AIM, 2012b). A few modules on the list include: antecedent-based interventions, discrete trial training, functional communi cation training, pivotal response training, structured te aching, and social narratives. In conclusion, there are many aspects related to educating students with ASD in which professionals need additional knowledge and skil ls to effectively improve the quality of education they provide to all of their students with ASD. These techniques can also be used with typically developing students. This paper ha s provided some background information on ASD and instructional strategies that can be used with students with ASD.
