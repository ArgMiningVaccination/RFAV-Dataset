HS1020 IPCondRoster CONDITION - A condition is a physical or mental health problem that can be identified by a health care professional by examining you and by using tests. Surgical procedures or operations are not considered conditions. A respondent may report an operation as a condition. You will need to probe the respondent and record the condition that led to the surgical procedure or operation. While our goal is to enter the exact medical name on the Conditions Roster, sometimes, even after probing, our respondent is unable to give us anything more than a symptom or symptoms. For example, the respondent could say \"I went to the doctor last month because I was having stomach pains. He did some tests and didn't find anything but my stomach still hurt. I waited and finally it went away on its own.\" In this case, a clear diagnosis was never established and you should record the symptoms (in this case, stomach pains) as the condition name. For specific probes to use with respondents, refer to the Job Aid \"Probes for Conditions\" in the Interview Quick Reference Guide. AH1075 CondInj ACCIDENT/INJURY - Physical problems because of some sort of external trauma to the body such as a fall or being in an auto accident. This refers to unexpected and undesirable events. Accidents may include poisonings, where the condition results from swallowing, breathing, or coming in contact with some poisonous substance. Illnesses and other types of problems due to a natural process in the body, such as any type of disease, should not be included. Please use care when coding that a condition is due to an accident or injury. A condition, such as \"broken eardrum\" may be due to an accident/injury or may be due to some other cause, such as childhood disease. Exposure to heavy lifting, loud noise, and other similar hazards are considered accidents/injuries only when they are one-time occurrences. For example, a punctured eardrum resulting from a loud explosion would be considered an accident/injury, but continued exposure to loud noises at work resulting in partial deafness would not be considered an accident/injury. For the latter case, code no. Follow the same procedure if the cause is continued strain from continuous heavy lifting, etc. Code this question as yes only if the respondent is sure that the condition resulted from an accident or injury. If after probing, your respondent is still unsure, assume that it is not due to an accident or injury and code no. HP1165 CovdDepend DEPENDENT - A person who is covered by an insurance policy purchased or obtained by another individual (the policyholder). CP1055 CPaySameLRnd COPAYMENT - A fixed sum that a person pays for health services, regardless of the actual charge (the insurer pays the rest of the actual charge).

CP1065 CPayIntro CHARGE - The dollar amount asked ('charged') for a service by a health care provider. This may not be the actual amount paid to the provider. REA1250 CurrInstd INSTITUTIONALIZED IN A HEALTH CARE FACILITY - A person is considered institutionalized in a health care facility if s/he is living in a facility that provides 24-hour continuous skilled nursing and personal care by trained medical personnel, regardless of age. These patients receive ongoing treatment for chronic diseases or disabilities, and require preventive, diagnostic, therapeutic, and supportive services over long periods of time. Do not include community-based facilities, including community-based hospitals, as institutionalized. 24-HOUR SKILLED NURSING CARE - Skilled nursing care involves licensed professionals performing services either for short-term needs such as rehabilitation, or for long-term care for serious illnesses or conditions. In addition to 24-hour skilled medical care for both acute and chronic conditions due to an injury or illness, patients receive additional help for daily activities of living. EV1045 OthEvntDatePicker PROBES FOR A VISIT ON A SINGLE DATE STEP 1: SHOW RESPONDENT HARDCOPY CALENDAR. PROBE: To keep working correctly, the laptop needs a date for the health care event.

It is a form of COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). PE1080 DxDiabetes DIABETES - Diabetes is a health problem caused by decreased production of insulin, or by decreased ability to use insulin. Insulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas that is necessary for cells to be able to use blood sugar. Diabetes occurs in several forms, the most common are: Type I, Type II, and gestational diabetes. However, do not include any occurrence of gestational diabetes for this question.

The commission period and the base rate period need not be of the same length. For example, the commission period could be monthly, daily, or hourly. REB1535 EduLevel REGULAR SCHOOL - A school that advances a person toward an elementary or high school diploma, or a college/university or professional school (such as law, medicine, dentistry) degree. Regular school includes graded public, private, and parochial schools, colleges, universities, graduate and professional schools, seminaries where a Bachelor's degree is offered, junior colleges specializing in skill training, colleges of education, and nursing schools where a Bachelor's degree is offered. Count schooling in other than regular schools only if the credits obtained are acceptable in a regular school system. If the person attended school in another country, in an un-graded school, in a 'normal school', under a tutor, or under other special circumstances, ask the respondent to give the nearest equivalent of years in regular U.S. school. If the person attended school outside of the 'regular' school system, you will need to probe to determine if the schooling is applicable here. Use the following guidelines to determine if the schooling should be included at this question: Training Programs - Count training received 'on the job', in the Armed Forces, or through correspondence school only if it was credited toward a school diploma, high school equivalency (GED), or college degree. Vocational, Trade, or Business School - Do not include secretarial school, mechanical or computer training school, nursing school where a Bachelor's degree is not offered, and other vocational trade or business schools outside the regular school system. General Educational Development (GED) or High School Equivalency - An exam certified equivalent of a high school diploma. If the person has not actually completed all four years of high school, but has acquired his/her GED (high school equivalency based on passing the GED exam), count this as you would a high school graduate and code Twelfth Grade (High School Diploma). Adult Education - Adult education classes should not be included as regular school unless such schooling has been counted for credit in a regular school system. If a person has taken adult education classes but not for credit, these classes should not be counted as regular school. Adult education courses given in a public school building are part of regular schooling only if their completion can advance a person toward an elementary school certificate, a high school diploma (or GED), or college degree. Nursing Education - Education for nurses and nursing related fields can vary. If there are questions from the respondent, please use the following guidelines. The CNA is a vocational training program that lasts usually 6-9 months and is not a degree- select the grade/level completed at the last regular school. The LPN and LVN programs usually include a \"diploma\" or \"certification\" after one year's vocational training; select the most appropriate category under the heading for \"College:\" and code the \"Other Degree\" at the follow-up question. The RN is a degree program from either a nursing school (usually a 3 year program equivalent to 3 years of college and equivalent to more than an associate degree) or a community college or college/university program that can either be at the associates, bachelors, masters, or PhD levels-select the most appropriate category under the heading for \"College:\" and code the appropriate degree at the follow-up question. GRADE OR YEAR - For this study, we have classified grades 1 through 8 as elementary school, and grades 9 through 12 as high school. However, you should note that the final grade of elementary school may be anywhere from grade 5 to grade 8, depending on the school system. So, if the respondent says the person you are asking about completed elementary school, probe to determine what grade that represents. Completing a given grade in school should be counted as the number of years it normally takes to complete that grade level of education, regardless of how many years it actually took the person to finish. This means that for persons who skipped or repeated grades in elementary school, you will enter the highest grade completed regardless of the number of years they were in school. This rule is true for elementary school through high school and is especially relevant to college. For example, if the person you are asking about is reported as having a 'Bachelor's Degree', it should be coded as 'Fourth Year (Bachelor's Degree)' regardless of how many years it took him/her to receive it. Code 'Five or More Years (Graduate Degree)' should be entered only if the person has completed one or more years of graduate or professional school. For persons still in school, be sure to report the highest grade/level completed. For example, a person currently in the 10th grade probably completed the 9th grade. ER1010 ERVstCat The purpose of this question is to identify the best category of care the person received during this visit to the emergency room. Code only one response. DIAGNOSIS OR TREATMENT - Diagnosis is an examination or test to detect the presence of a disease or other physical problem. Treatment is any procedure to counteract the effects of a disease or health care problem. An example of a visit for 'diagnosis and treatment' is a person who had a fever and a sore throat: the provider diagnosed the condition as the flu, and recommended treatment of bed rest and aspirin. Even if the provider determines the person does not have a health condition or if the provider is unable to determine what the problem is, the visit was for purposes of diagnosis regardless of the outcome of the examination. If the only care received during the visit was tests such as blood work or x-rays, consider this 'diagnosis or treatment for a health problem' even if there is no known condition. For example, if a woman has a baseline mammogram, this is considered 'diagnosis' even if no condition is suspected or discovered. EMERGENCY (E.G., ACCIDENT OR INJURY) - Refers to immediate care intended to assess and address an acute problem that has the patient in extreme discomfort or threatens his/her life. PSYCHOTHERAPY OR MENTAL HEALTH COUNSELING - A treatment technique for certain forms of mental disorders relying principally on verbal communications between the mental health professional and the patient.

Any other professional mental health therapist such as a psychiatrist, psychologist, counselor, social worker, etc. would be included. FOLLOW-UP OR POST-OPERATIVE VISIT - Includes visits to check on patient's progress after some type of surgery or other medical treatment. This includes visits to verify that patient has fully recovered, to remove stitches or a cast, or to adjust medications. IMMUNIZATIONS OR SHOTS - Immunizations are oral medications or shots given to the patient to prevent the patient from contracting a communicable disease. Shots are hypodermic injections. This category includes allergy shots. PREGNANCY RELATED (INCLUDING PRENATAL CARE AND DELIVERY)- Consultations and examinations relating to pregnancy, i.e., prenatal (or before delivery) and postnatal (or after delivery) care of the mother up to six weeks after childbirth. This category also includes normal childbirth (delivery of the baby through the birth canal) and cesarean section (surgical operation for delivering a baby by cutting through the mother's abdominal and uterine walls). ED1035 EvntDate STEP 1: SHOW RESPONDENT HARDCOPY CALENDAR. PROBE: To keep working correctly, the laptop needs a date for the health care event. I'm going to ask a few questions to help us come up with a date that is close to the date of the visit, without worrying too much about getting the exact date. What month did you visit (PROVIDER)? STEP 2: ADDITIONAL PROBES TO NARROW DOWN VISIT DATE: PROBE: Did you visit (PROVIDER) at the beginning, middle, or end of the month? PROBE: Which week in the month did you visit (PROVIDER)? PROBE: Did you visit (PROVIDER) on the weekday or weekend? PROBE: Did you visit (PROVIDER) on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, or Friday?

EV1020 EvntTp For specific probes to use with respondents, refer to the \"Probes to Determine Event Type\" job aid in the Interview Quick Reference Guide. HOSPITAL STAY (HS) - MEPS defines a hospital stay as a visit to a hospital where a person is admitted to the hospital and stayed at least one night. If a baby is born in a hospital, two events should be created; a hospital stay for the mother and a hospital stay for the child. If a respondent indicates that a person was admitted to the hospital, but was discharged without staying overnight, code the visit as a Hospital Outpatient Department Visit (OP). HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOM VISIT (ER) - Any visit made during the person's reference period to a hospital emergency room. EMERGENCY ROOM - A medical department that is open 24 hours a day where no appointment is necessary in order to receive care. The emergency room may be located at a hospital. It may also be at a different location than a hospital if the facility is identified as an emergency room and it is owned by or affiliated with a hospital. Medical care may be administered by a physician, nurse, physician assistant, or other medical provider. Do not include 'urgent care centers', which are owned by, or affiliated with a hospital. Visits made to that type of facility should be coded as an outpatient department visit. HOSPITAL OUTPATIENT DEPARTMENT VISIT (OP) - Any visit made during the person's reference period to a hospital outpatient department. OUTPATIENT DEPARTMENT - A unit of a hospital, a facility, or 'urgent care center' owned by or affiliated with a hospital. The outpatient department provides health and medical services to individuals who do not require hospitalization overnight and may also provide general primary care. Do not include 'urgent care centers' which are not owned by, or affiliated with a hospital. Urgent care centers which are not affiliated with or owned by a hospital should be coded as a 'Medical Provider Office or Clinic' visit. Include visits made to outpatient departments for medical tests only. Some doctors or other types of providers may rent office space at a hospital. If the person reports that the visit occurred at a hospital, but not at an emergency room or outpatient department, probe to determine if it was at a provider's office. If this is the case, code the event type as 'Medical Provider Office or Clinic' visit. Examples of outpatient departments include: DENTAL OFFICE VISIT (DN) - Any visit made during the person's reference period to a dental care provider for the purpose of dental care. A tooth or mouth problem tended to by a medical doctor is not a Dental Office event. If a dental care provider was seen, the event type is Dental Office. If not, code the event type as a 'Medical Provider Office or Clinic' visit. DENTAL CARE PROVIDER - Medical persons whose primary occupation is caring for teeth, gums, and jaws. Dental care includes general work such as fillings, cleaning, extractions, and also specialized work such as root canals, fittings for braces, etc. MEDICAL PROVIDER OFFICE OR CLINIC (MV) - Any visit made during the person's reference period to a specific setting of care where a medical provider was seen.

Many types of events can be classified as Medical Provider visits. The following is a list of some different types of health related events that should be classified as a 'Medical Provider Office or Clinic' visit. TELEHEALTH (TH) - Telehealth, also referred to as telemedicine, is a health care provider's use of telecommunications to assist in the diagnosis, treatment, or monitoring of a patient's medical condition. This involves real-time communication with a provider, via phone, video, or various web or mobile based applications that support telehealth communications. Even though telehealth is usually received at home, telehealth visits should not be recorded as Home Health visits unless the care received is from a Home Health provider. CARE RECEIVED AT HOME (HH) - Visits to the home from persons (e.g. nurses, home health aides, social workers, therapists, or medical doctors) who provide help to a person who has a health problem or condition.

Care and support may come from a variety of sources such as family, volunteers, nurses, social workers, the clergy, as well as physicians. Do not include hospice care services delivered at the patient's home. Care provided in the home should be coded as 'Care Received at Home'. RESPITE CARE - Care received for only a limited time by severely disabled or impaired persons (e.g., quadriplegics, developmentally disabled children or adults, or Alzheimer's patients) in a long-term health care place (e.g., a nursing home) or another person's home, as a way of providing an interval of rest or relief to family members who are the usual primary caregivers at home. If there is any question about whether the person received care at an institution or a hospital, always code the care as having been received during a 'Hospital Stay'. GLASSES OR CONTACT LENSES - (CODE NOT ALWAYS AVAILABLE) The actual purchase of glasses or contacts during the reference period. Eye exams should be classified as a Medical Provider visit. OTHER MEDICAL EXPENSES - (CODE NOT ALWAYS AVAILABLE) Includes the use of ambulance services or any purchase made during the reference period of disposable supplies or long term medical equipment.

CP1105 EvpvKnowTotal WHAT MAKES UP TOTAL CHARGE - The total dollar amount asked ('charged') for a service by a health care provider. This includes: If the bill or statement lists charges for procedures such as x-rays, lab tests, or diagnostic procedures separate from other charges for the visit and are not included in the total charge, add those charges to the others to obtain one 'total charge' that includes all charges that are associated with the visit. However, if the person has a separate bill or statement for procedures, do not include those charges in the total charge for the visit. FLAT FEE - A situation where the person is charged a 'lump sum' for a variety of services or a series of visits which relate to the same condition. CP1125 EvpvSetAmt SET AMOUNT - An amount a provider charges for a visit no matter what the specific services provided during a particular visit were. A possible example of this are regular visits to a physical therapist for treatment: the specific treatment may be different from visit to visit yet the charge is always the same. COPAYMENT - A fixed sum that a person pays for health services, regardless of the actual charge (the insurer pays the rest of the actual charge). For example, the beneficiary may pay $10 for each office visit, $75 for each day in the hospital, and $5 for each drug prescription. For the purposes of MEPS, paying $0 for every visit, regardless of the services, is classified as a copayment. AH1125 Exer5Days MODERATE OR VIGOROUS PHYSICAL ACTIVITY - Moderate physical activity causes only light sweating or a slight or moderate increase in breathing or heart rate and would include activities such as fast walking, raking leaves, mowing the lawn, or heavy cleaning.

PIECEWORK - A method of incentive wage payment where earnings are based on a constant rate of pay for each unit of output. For example, $3.50 for each garment produced. COMMISSION - A method of incentive payment paid in addition to or in lieu of a base rate, based upon business created or sales confirmed. The commission period and the base rate period need not be of the same length. For example, the commission period could be monthly, daily, or hourly. BONUS - Special cash payments. Sometimes bonuses are given as a reward for an employee's production in excess of a quota or for completion of a job in less than a standard time period. Bonuses may also be paid by the employer to those employees who meet certain criteria (e.g., one year of continuous employment with the establishment) or they may be lump sum payments to all employees (e.g., Christmas bonuses). Payments may be graduated according to a worker's length of service, position in the organization, or a combination of these and other criteria. BY THE JOB/MILE - Method of payment based on each mile driven or job completed. EW1110 HrsSalaryBased HOURS WORKED PER WEEK (ON WHICH SALARY BASED) - The number of hours worked per week on which the person's salary is based is often not the same as the hours actually worked. In this question, we want the number of hours on which the salary is based, regardless of how many actual hours the person works during the week. Overtime hours should not be included. By definition, salaried RU members are not compensated for overtime. HX1790 PlanHasHSA HEALTH SAVINGS ACCOUNTS (HSAs) - An account that is used to pay for medical expenses not covered by one's insurance plan. HSAs require a companion high deductible insurance policy. Contributions are made into the account by the individual or the individual's employer. The contributions are invested over time and can be used to pay for qualified medical expenses. HSAs are different from Flexible Spending Accounts in that HSA balances can roll over from year to year and money in a Flexible Spending Account must be spent by the end of the plan year or you lose it. A Flexible Spending Account can only be opened when offered by your employer, and you do not need to have a high-deductible health insurance plan or any type of health insurance plan. HRA plans are differ from HSAs only in that plans must be solely funded by the employer and cannot be funded by employee salary reduction. HRA's are most commonly offered in conjunction with a High Deductible Health Plan. Do not include participation in a Medicare Medical Savings Account which is associated with a Medicare Advantage Plan.

Hawaii and Alaska are considered inside the United States. HE1215 LmtSocial LIMITED IN PARTICIPATING - Difficulties that limit the person's ability to participate in the activities. We are only interested in difficulties that are associated with an impairment or a physical or mental health problem. Limited activity participation (for example, playing sports) means that a person cannot do the activity as long or in the same way as he/she did previous to the impairment or physical or mental health problem, but still does it to some extent (as opposed to not being able to do it at all). IMPAIRMENT - Examples include missing limbs, fingers or other body parts; partial paralysis from an early case of polio, accident or war wound; stiff joints, deformed fingers or other physical evidence of arthritis; and vision or hearing loss. HE1180 LmtWork LIMITED ABILITY - Difficulties in performing a task independently. We are only interested in difficulties that are associated with an impairment or a physical or mental health problem. Limited activity ability (for example, work activity) means that a person cannot do the role as long or in the same way as he/she did previous to the impairment or physical or mental health problem, but still does it to some extent (as opposed to not being able to do it at all). IMPAIRMENT - Examples include missing limbs, fingers or other body parts; partial paralysis from an early case of polio, accident or war wound; stiff joints, deformed fingers or other physical evidence of arthritis; and vision or hearing loss. REA1265 LeftInstMMFam LEAVE THE HEALTH CARE FACILITY - The person must have been discharged from or have formally left the health care facility because the person is deceased or because the person is now living somewhere other than the health care facility. If the person has only temporarily left the health care facility to visit family or for a stay in the hospital, do not count this as having left the facility. RJ1045 MainJob MAIN JOB/BUSINESS - If only one current job or business, that job/business is the main one. If more than one current job or business, the respondent should designate as main, the job s/he considers the most important or the one worked the most hours. The main job is not necessarily the job held the longest. JOB - A definite arrangement for regular work every week or month, for pay or other compensation (e.g., profits, anticipated profits, or pay in kind, such as room and board). A job may also be a formal arrangement with one or more employers to work on a continuing basis for a specified number of hours per week or days per month, but on an irregular schedule during the specified week or month. BUSINESS - A business exists when one or more of the following conditions are met: REA1185 MaritalStatRnd MARRIED - Refers to legal marriage. This includes common law marriages in states where common law marriages are recognized (i.e., if state law considers them married, we consider them married). WIDOWED - Spouse is deceased. DIVORCED - Legal cancellation of marriage. SEPARATED - Legal or informal separation due to marital discord. It is necessary to probe further when a person is reported as 'separated' - if the spouse is absent for reasons other than marital discord, the 'married' category applies. NEVER MARRIED - A person is considered never married if s/he has never been legally married. If the person has had informal unions in the past but has never had a legal marriage, s/he is included in this category even if s/he considered themselves as living together as married partners. If the respondent asks what is meant by marriage, tell him or her that we are only interested in legal married status for this question. However, accept what the respondent tells you here without attempting to reconcile the response with information given previously concerning the marital status of the person. For example, if a respondent tells you here that he is married, but when you collected relationship information he told you that the woman he is living with is his 'partner', you would code him here as married and continue to the next person in the RU without questioning his response. An answer indicating that an RU member is 'single' or 'not married' should be probed to determine if s/he has been married in the past or not. REA1480 AddPersNotNew To be a member of the RU the person must be related to the reference person. Related includes blood, marriage, adoption, or linked by a marriage-like relationship. LIVING TOGETHER AS MARRIED/PARTNER RELATIONSHIPS - Respondents are asked to choose a marital status category that represents the legal status of each RU member age 16 or older and those whose age is unknown. Code separated or divorced only if the RU member is not living with the spouse for reasons of marital discord. If the husband and wife are separated for purposes of their employment, code them as married. Often respondents will report an RU member as single - yet this does not describe the RU member's legal status. A person reported as single could be separated, divorced, widowed, or never married. Remember to probe such responses to obtain the legal status. In addition to marriage, two people in a 'partner' relationship who are not married are considered related. This applies both to partners of the same sex and of different sexes. Because these are relationships between the household member and the Reference Person that the respondent may not have considered or offered, you may need to probe to determine if this category applies. Example: If the respondent is the Reference Person and is female and reports the relationship of an unrelated male to be a 'friend', you would want to tactfully probe to determine if she considers him her boyfriend or living together as married partners instead of just friends. If she says they are living together as married, they would be considered related. If they are not living together as if they are married partners, they should be viewed as unrelated. OP1010 OPSeeDoc MEDICAL DOCTOR - Include both doctors of medicine (M.D.) and doctors of osteopathy (D.O.). Specific examples of physicians include: Types of providers not to be counted as medical doctors are: HX1060 AnyCareR25 MEDICARE - A Federal health insurance program for people 65 or older and for certain persons under 65 with long-term disabilities. Almost everyone with Social Security is covered by Medicare. Medicare consists of four parts, A, B, C, and D: PART A - Part A is called the Hospital Insurance Program. It helps pay for inpatient care in a hospital or in a skilled nursing facility, and for hospice care. It is available to nearly everyone 65 or older. PART B - Part B is called the Supplementary Medical Insurance Program. It helps pay for the doctor and surgeon services, outpatient hospital services, medical equipment, and a number of other medical services and supplies. If a person chooses this additional insurance, the monthly premium is deducted from his/her Social Security to obtain coverage for Part B of Medicare. PART C - Part C encompasses the Medicare Advantage plans. A Medicare Advantage Plan (like an HMO or PPO) is a health plan choice available as part of Medicare. Medicare Advantage Plans, sometimes called \"Part C\" or \"MA Plans,\" are offered by private companies approved by Medicare. The plan provides all of a person's Part A (Hospital Insurance) and Part B (Medical Insurance) coverage.

Everyone with Medicare can choose this additional coverage, regardless of income and resources, health status, or current prescription expenses. HX1130 AnyCaid MEDICAID/SCHIP - Since respondents often confuse Medicaid and Medicare, stress to the respondent that for this question s/he should consider Medicaid or the State Children's health Insurance Program (SCHIP). Medicaid is often known by different names in different states, and is a Federally-assisted State-administered program. This program offers health benefits to low income persons on public assistance and, in some states, to those deemed medically needy because their incomes are only slightly above public assistance standards or because they have incurred substantial medical bills. Most SSI (Supplemental Security Income) recipients are covered by Medicaid, as are most TANF (Temporary Assistance for Needy Families) recipients and their dependents. The aged, the blind, and the disabled who are in financial need are also eligible for Medicaid. The Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) is a program which gives each state permission to offer health insurance for children, up to age 19, who are not already insured and for uninsured families with limited income and resources who earn too much to qualify for Medicaid. SCHIP is a state administered program and may be known by different names in different states. HS1055 IPPmed PRESCRIBED MEDICINE - Prescribed medicines are those ordered by a physician or other authorized medical person through a written or verbal prescription for a pharmacist to fill. Prescription medicines do not include: Some state laws require prescriptions for certain over-the-counter medicines. Sometimes physicians write a prescription for over-the-counter drugs such as aspirin. Therefore, consider any medicine a prescribed medicine if the respondent reports it as prescribed. If it is an over-the-counter drug, however, the prescription must be a written one to be filled by a pharmacist, not just an oral instruction. If in doubt, probe whether the patient got a written prescription to fill at a pharmacy. If there is still any doubt, report the medicine as a prescription medicine. ER1025 CodeAllERSvc LABORATORY TESTS - The non-invasive collection of samples of blood, urine, or any other body fluids, tissues, or other substances to be examined by a medical person in order to get more information about the patient's condition.

This is also referred to as CT imaging. EKG, ECG, OR EEG - EKG and ECG are both abbreviations for electrocardiogram which is a graphic record of the electrical activity of the heart. EEG is an abbreviation for electroencephalogram which is a graphic record of the electrical activity of the brain. VACCINATION - A shot or oral medication given to the patient to prevent him/her from contracting a communicable disease. PR1360 GovProgMetalPlan METAL PLANS - There are four types of health insurance plans available through the marketplace. They are Bronze, Silver, Gold and Platinum health insurance plans. They are sometimes referred to as \"metal plans\". The metal level corresponds to the average percentage of essential health care expenses that the plan will pay. On average, Bronze will cover 60%, Silver 70%, Gold 80% and Platinum 90% of essential health care expenses. This isn't the same as coinsurance, in which you pay a specific percentage of the cost of a specific service. The higher the metal level (i.e. Gold and Platinum), the more the plan will pay towards your health care expenses and,therefore, the lower your out-of-pocket costs for things such as deductibles, copayments and coinsurance. To qualify for a catastrophic plan, you must be under 30 years old or get a \"hardship exemption\" because the Marketplace determined that you're unable to afford health coverage. Catastrophic health plans have a low premium but very high out-of-pocket costs. EMA2690 MoreLoctn MORE THAN ONE LOCATION - This question pertains to the establishment which directly employs (pays) the RU member. A direct employer may have facilities at more than one location.

This code should also be used for extended relationships when a partner relationship exists within the RU. For example, when a partnership relationship exists in the RU, the code \"Other Related (no specify)\" can be used to reflect what the relationship would be if the partners were actually married. When in doubt, it is better to code \"Other Related, (No Specify)\" and include the person in the interview than to code \"Not Related\" for someone who should be included in the interview. The code \"Other Related, (No Specify)\" would also be used if a legal guardian and an unrelated ward reside in the same household. If the guardian and ward are related by blood, marriage or adoption, code their actual relationships to each other. The code \"Not Related\" should only be used if you realize you have mistakenly added someone to the RU who is definitely unrelated (i.e., friend, roommate, etc.). CAPI will then remove that person from the RU and they will not be included in the current interview. PE1175 Remission REMISSION - A complete or partial disappearance of the signs and symptoms of disease in response to treatment. This is generally the period during which a disease is under control. A remission, however, is not necessarily a cure.

TO BE BORN (BABY) - This category is for the newborn baby's hospital stay. PREGNANCY RELATED COMPLICATIONS - Code this category only to capture a hospital stay due to a reason related to a woman's pregnancy, where the result was not a live birth. This could include reasons such as stillbirth, miscarriage, placenta previa, or other pregnancy-related complications that resulted in a hospital-stay admission. If the result was a live birth, regardless of any related complication, use the code 'GIVE BIRTH TO A BABY'. ST1035 ProxyRoster RESPONDENT RULES - BEST/PREFERRED RESPONDENT- The best or preferred respondent for the interview is the person who is most knowledgeable about the family's health care and who is keeping records about health care use and expenses since January 1st. For Round 1, this is likely to be the person who was the respondent for the NHIS interview and, in most cases, was the person contacted on the advance contact effort. For Rounds 2-5, the best respondent is the person who was respondent for the previous round's interview. SELECTING A NEW RU MEMBER AS RESPONDENT- If you need to select a new respondent for the RU, select an RU member who is at least 18 years old or older and knowledgeable about the family's health care use and expenses. Always encourage all adult RU members to assist with the interview, especially if there is a specific RU member for whom the selected respondent cannot provide all health information. Keep in mind that a new respondent may also be a new member of the RU. Verify that the person is a member of the RU before selecting 'RU member' for respondent type. PROXY RESPONDENTS- A proxy respondent is someone who doesn't live in the RU (including a relative). The proxy could also be someone who lives in another RU in the DU (for example, an informed caretaker if the RU member cannot answer for himself or herself). If the respondent is an RU member from a different RU in the DU, you must first determine if the person has joined the RU you are interviewing (usually through marriage or a partnership relationship). In that case, the person is now an RU member and not a proxy. However, if the person is indeed a member of a different RU, he or she would be coded as a proxy respondent. In a small number of cases it may not be possible to conduct an interview with an RU member. Examples include: The proxy respondent must be someone 18 years or older who can provide information about the RU member(s) health care use and expenses during the person's reference period. Before you complete the interview with a proxy, you must obtain approval from your supervisor. Note: If Round 1 and the only RU member died or entered an institution before January 1st, do not continue with the interview. Verify the date of death or institutionalization and close out the case.
