Jones, Director & State Historian Megan FastJeff Mammenga South Dakota State Historical Society Board of Trustees Sean Flynn, President Tom Hurlbert, Vice PresidentMarshall WinterDavid A. Wolff Department of Education Tiffany Sanderson, SecretarySOUTH DAKOTA STATE HISTORICAL SOCIETY: ANNUAL REPORT FOR 2021 Vol. 37 , No. 1 Annual Report Jan. 2022 The year 2021 has been one of renewed efforts as well as rededication to our mis - sion in the midst of the challenges brought on by the continued pandemic. Dr. Ben Jones completed his first year as the new State His - torian and Director of the Society. With the support of the Trustees, Foundation and the active participation of the staff, the Society recast its mission statement. It now reads: \"Together we empower audiences to experi - ence South Dakota's stories. We profession - ally collect, preserve, interpret and publish our history for future generations. We are proudly supported by the South Dakota His - torical Society Foundation and are affiliated with the Smithsonian Institution.\" We will also begin to use the tagline \"Experience History\" in our materials. Despite the pandemic, visitors to the mu - seum, archives and other activities in the Cultural Heritage Center numbered nearly 11,000 for the year. Our staff continues to adapt to the conditions, developing ways to enhance public outreach and grow our audi - ence. We've increased our social media pres - ence and are adding virtual attendance op - tions for the 2022 History Conference. Most notably, we started a podcast, \"History 605,\" in July. It features a wide variety of authors and influential South Dakotans as guests. A new episode is released every two weeks. The Archaeological Research Center con - tinued its very methodical unpacking and re - organizing of materials while having a busy summer season supporting a wide variety of projects. The Archives acquired a greater capacity to scan documents and make them available online. Additionally, the Pickler Papers, an important collection of suffrage materials, were organized, scanned and are now accessible online. Similarly, the South Dakota Historical Society Foundation con - tinued its work on the women's history ini - tiative \"Her Vote. Her Voice.\" and has begun to organize the project's oral history efforts. The Museum wrapped up a successful tem -porary exhibit on the presence of Cold War nuclear missiles in South Dakota and de - signed a fascinating exhibit on fashion in the state. The Museum staff also organized a very successful history conference. Historic Preservation continued its work managing the Deadwood Grant program and garnered six more sites on the National Historic Reg - ister. We also appreciate all the volunteers who stepped up to help our staff in 2021. This year's Governor's Awards for His - tory named Scott Tubbs of Rapid City's Stevens High School as History Teacher of the Year. The Individual Governor's Award went to three impressive and creative peo - ple, Larry Belitz of Hot Springs and Wayne Fanebust and John Mollison of Sioux Falls. Jay Vogt and Nancy Tystad Koupal earned the Doane Robinson Award for their dedica - tion to advancing South Dakota's history. This year, Board of Trustees elections re - sulted in both change and continuity. Peggy Sanders of Oral was reelected to the at-large position and Rolene Schliesman of Wilmot was reelected to the architectural historian position. Gov. Kristi Noem appointed Mar - shall Damgaard of Sioux Falls and Billie Kingfisher of Vermillion to the two at-large three-year terms vacated by Francis White - bird and Jon K. Lauck. Sean J. Flynn took on the role of president from Brad Tennant and Tom Hurlbert took on the role of vice president from David Wolff. We look forward to an exciting year. Gov. Noem's budget recommendation includes $8.8 million in funding for a major renova - tion of the Cultural Heritage Center. If the legislature supports it, 2022 will begin a time of great change. While that path is not clearly defined, we know that professionally collecting, preserving, interpreting and pub - lishing our state's history requires improve - ments to the Cultural Heritage Center and we look forward to the potential renewal that such a renovation would mean for all of us.

After moving into our new building in July 2020, 2021 saw the last stages of un - packing and renovation. These efforts in - cluded, among other things, recataloging the research library, installing new flooring in collection storage and placing map cases on wheeled platforms. The final task is to set up the comparative collection room. In addi - tion, the office published the first in a series on material culture of South Dakota, a guide to the stone used to produce tools found at archaeological sites across the state. Archaeological Research Center Staff Renee Boen, Director & State Ar Notes is published three times yearly by the South Dakota State Histori- cal Society. History Notes is available upon demand on audio tape and large print. Other forms will be considered upon request. There were 2,500 copies of History Notes printed at a cost of 49 cents per copy.ARCHAEOLOGY Printed on recycled paper.In 2021, the Archaeological Research Cen - ter conducted 62 Class III cultural resources projects, seven of which required evaluative testing to determine National Register eligi - bility. A total of 72 Class III survey reports and 117 Class I records search reports, which did not require pedestrian survey, were com - pleted. Projects were conducted for the De - partment of Transportation, Game, Fish and Parks, the state Veterans Home and private contractors. Mining and exploration permit reviews increased almost 40 percent in 2021 for a total of 138 submissions. The staff completed and submitted the Na - tional Register of Historic Places evaluation report for 39MD0087, a bison processing site along the Belle Fourche River in Meade County. Staff worked on two grants this year with funds from the State Historic Preserva - tion Office. One project involved completing the fieldwork and the final report for Phase II of a Remote Sensing Pilot Project along the Moreau River drainage in western South Dakota. Staff also finished fieldwork for the other grant, which proposes to nominate five burial mound sites in Brookings, Mellette and Roberts counties to the National Regis - ter of Historic Places. We completed curation contracts with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Bureau of Reclamation and Black Hills National Forest in 2021. A total of 2,269 digital cata - log records for 8,537 historic artifacts were created for the Black Hills National Forest.

State the South Dakota Equal Suffrage Association. To improve access to the collection and commemorate the 100th anniversary of the 19th Amendment, the suffrage portions of the Pickler Papers were selected for digitiza - tion and cataloging. These records are now available to the public on the South Dakota Digital Archives (https://sddigitalarchives. contentdm.oclc.org/digital/). A generous do - nation from the F. L. Clarkson Family Foun - dation made digitization of this collection possible. Archives Month was celebrated in Octo - ber 2021. Staff developed and displayed a poster on the Archives Month webpage for viewers to download, print and post in other archival organizations across the state. The Archives also hosted events online to inform the public about the institution's resources. Manuscript archivist Matthew Reitzel led a \"Recently Accessioned Manuscript Collec - tions\" YouTube presentation. Archives staff participated in National Archives Month events, such as Electronic Records Day and #AskAnArchivistDay. In Pierre, the Archives hosted a \"Walking through History\" event: five reenactors representing Governors Ar - thur Mellette, Coe Crawford, Robert Vessey, George T. Mickelson and Ralph Herseth in - teracted with visitors along the Trail of Gov - ernors. The 44 participants were encouraged to visit the State Archives to view a selection of governors' papers. Staff also hosted a Vir - tual History Trivia Night, with five teams and 14 attendees. The Archives received 247 new donations this year, totaling 219.9 cubic feet and nearly 300,000 MB of records. Staff processed and made accessible 249 cubic feet and 225,981 MB of manuscript and government records and cataloged and added 121 library books to the library collections. The Archives reached 844 people through presentations and consul - tations. Staff members also inputted 38,649 entries from the 1935 state census into a database. The third round of funding from the Na - tional Endowment for the Humanities to digitize historical newspapers ended in June 2021. The Archives added 100 new rolls of newspapers on microfilm to the Chronicling America website, making a total of 300 rolls available on the free website. The John and Alice Pickler collection was the focus of 2021's digitization project. In 1991, 65 boxes of Pickler family records were donated to the South Dakota State Ar - chives, including photographs, political pa - pers, business records and over four boxes of suffrage-related correspondence, speech notes, meeting minutes and booklets. John Pickler and his wife Alice moved to Faulkton, Dakota Territory, in 1882 and became promi - nent citizens in the area. John was elected to the territorial legislature in 1884 and intro - duced suffrage legislation, which was unsuc - cessful, in 1885. He also served in the U.S. House of Representatives for eight years and advocated for women's right to vote.

State Historic Preservation Office Staff Ted Spencer, Director & State Historic Preservation Officer Liz AlmlieJenna Carlson-DietmeierHeather MullinerChris NelsonKatie ShroyerKatie WasleyJustin State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO) had another fulfilling year identifying, recording and preserving historic sites across the state. We also welcomed two new staff members to our office this year: Katie Shroyer as our Historic Preservation Assistant in May, and Justin Woods as our Review and Compliance Archeologist in Au - gust. They have been wonderful additions to our staff in 2021. Our Deadwood Fund Grant Program, now in its 24th year, awarded 11 new grants for preservation projects, for a total award amount of $146,050 with planned match - ing funds of $494,000. The anticipated total public-private investment for historic preser - vation will be $640,050. The State Property Tax Moratorium (SPTM) financial incentive program certified 14 projects in five counties in 2021. The SPTM is an eight-year state his - toric preservation property tax moratorium for restoring and rehabilitating historic build - ings. If a historic building qualifies for the tax benefit, an eight-year delay is placed on the property tax assessment of any certified im - provements, which provides an important in - centive to initiate essential preservation work on important structures. Of the 14 properties receiving the moratorium, 11 are private resi - dences and the remaining three are or will be The Gillette House in Deadwood was approved to receive the State Property Tax Mortarium benefit. income-produc - ing properties. Investment per project ranged from $3,000 to $200,000, while private invest - ment totaled $1.77 million. SHPO also ensured that six proper - ties in South Dakota were added to the National Reg - ister of Historic Places program in 2021. We ap - proved impor - tant updates to the boundar - ies and specific properties en - compassing the Lead Historic District. In addi - tion, four other properties were added to the State Register of Historic Places. We will also be submitting the Brown Homestead, located near Cactus Flats, to the National Park Service for National Historic Landmark (NHL) listing status. This very significant site will hopefully join the 16 other NHLs listed in South Dakota. An NHL listing is the highest honorific designation be - stowed by the National Park Service. This past year was also noteworthy as SHPO worked through important Emergency Conservation Program (ECP) projects due to drought and wildfires across the state. The Department of Agriculture approved special funding for 39 counties in South Dakota se - verely affected by drought and wildfires. Our dedicated Review and Compliance Staff pro - cessed over 1,200 ECP applications over a six-month span, ensuring farmers and ranchers could acquire water resources for livestock, and new water pipelines and stock dams to help with fire suppression activities in dry, ru - ral parts of the state. Our staff of eight preservationists continues to do outstanding work each and every day to make South Dakota's communities better.

SchmidtMUSEUM vert the Observation Gallery on the Cultural Heritage Center's second floor. In December 2020, Corey Christianson started work as the Collections Management Specialist. She has been barcoding the collection and updating the museum's computer database records. Beginning Oct. 1, 2020, all South Dakota residents were able to visit the South Dakota State Historical Society Museum free of charge. Out-of-state admission fees were ad - justed to $8 for adults, $7 for AAA members and $6 for visitors over 60 years old. \"South Dakota's Wardrobe: Selected Items from the Collection\" opened in the Hogen Gallery in June 2021. Items in the exhibit range from work clothes to formal wear for both men and women from the 19th into the 21st century. The famous Pheasant Dress, featuring a complete pheasant bustle, is a highlight of the collection. The Museum added 103 artifacts to its collection in 2021. Notable among these donations are a brothel sign from the Black Hills Gold Rush days for \"Diddlin' Dora's\" establishment in Belle Fourche and a pat - ent medicine tin for \"Pipal's Healing Salve\" made by the Pipal Remedy Company in Academy. The tin's box advertised the won - ders of the salve in several languages, re - flecting South Dakota's immigrant roots. In December 2021, four works by Oscar Jay Smith, Museum Director for the South Dakota State Historical Society Mu - seum since 2012, retired from the position in November 2021. Under Smith's leadership, the Museum became a Smithsonian Affiliate in 2013. That same year, Smith served as the staff liaison for the loan of the Great Sioux Horse Effigy to an international touring exhibition, \"The Plains Indians: Artists of Earth and Sky.\" He also led the effort to con - A tin of Pipal's Heal - ing Salve made in Academy and a brothel sign from the Black Hills were do - nated to the Museum this year. Howe were sent to the Smithsonian for an exhibit opening in spring 2022. The exhibit will be at the National Museum of the Amer - ican Indian in New York, the Portland Art Museum and the South Dakota Art Museum. COVID-19 caused the Museum to change in-house programming for 2021 from a make-and-take format that brought visitors in to do hands-on projects to a take-to-make format where visitors picked up materials and instructions and took projects home to complete. Our take-to-make events drew 340 visitors. After being completely shut down in March 2020 by COVID, the Museum's edu - cation kit program picked back up. We are on track to have kits out to over 77 venues with over 2,000 users in 2021. Off-site programs in 2021 were held for the Stanley County GOLD afterschool pro - gram in Fort Pierre and the White Rock Col - ony School in Roberts County. The Museum also hosted the South Dakota History Con - ference online through a digital, accessible format in April and participated digitally in the South Dakota Indian Education Confer - ence in November 2021. Lastly, the Museum hosted \"Measuring South Dakota\" at the Capital Lake Visitors Center in Pierre in August 2021, which al - lowed visitors to explore three historical measuring methods. Research and Publishing Staff Dedra McDonald Birzer, Director Mary AndinoSarah DozierCody EwertJennifer McIntyre RESEARCH AND PUBLISHING Continuity amidst change sums up 2021 for Research and Publishing. While our high-quality publications continued to gar - ner awards and our book sales climbed back to pre-COVID levels, we also welcomed one new staff member and bid farewell to another. Mary Andino joined us as an associate editor in May, shortly after receiving a doc - torate in history. Managing Editor Michael Burns accepted a position at the Marine Corps University Press in July. Cody Ewert is now Managing Editor of both the \"South Dakota History\" quarterly journal and of SDHS Press. One major highlight for 2021 occurred at the annual meeting of the Western His - tory Association in October, when Gerard Boychuk's article, \"'Not a Tinker's Damn': The Politics of Suffrage in the South Dakota Election of 1918,\" received the Michael P. Malone Award for Best Article on State His - tory. This article appeared in the Fall 2020 issue of \"South Dakota History.\" The SDHS Press released four new books in 2021. The delightfully whimsical \"Char - lie Russell and the Gnomes of Bull Head Lodge\" came out in early April. Written by Emily Crawford Wilson and illustrated by Jeanne Bowman, \"Charlie Russell\" narrates a tale for children based on the gnomes that Russell crafted as guardians of his Lake Mc - Donald cabin. David Wolff's \"The Savior of Deadwood: James K. P. Miller on the Gold Frontier\" hit the shelves in late May, offering the story of a largely forgotten man whose vision transformed Deadwood from a gold camp into a permanent town. Sandy Bar - nard's contribution to the South Dakota Bi - ography Series, \"George Armstrong Custer: A Military Life,\" was released in June. Bar - nard provides a balanced portrait of this con - troversial western figure. The Pioneer Girl Project, led by Nancy Tystad Koupal, released its third volume in October. \"Pioneer Girl: The Revised Texts\" is a monumental work of scholarship on Laura Ingalls Wilder and Rose Wilder Lane, documenting the process through which Wilder would ultimately become an icon of young adult literature. \"The Savior of Deadwood\" by David Wolff provides a fresh look into the development of the Black Hills. The fall issue of \"South Dakota History\" explored many topics, including Army cadets stationed in Spearfish and German language newspapers. Now in its 51st year, \"South Dakota His - tory\" included excerpts from William J. Bu - low's autobiography and Rose Wilder Lane's \"Behind the Headlight,\" along with articles on Black Hills mapping, Indian rights advo - cates, missionary children, Sioux Falls Col - lege, World War II Army Air Forces Cadets in Spearfish, the German language press, preservation efforts in Rapid City, Vermil - lion's Carnegie libraries and the Dakota Wesleyan observatory. Research and Publishing also compiled three issues of the \"History Notes\" newslet - ter and featured new monthly blogs as well as old favorites on our website, sdhspress. com. Books and back issues of \"South Dako - ta History\" may be ordered on the website. New blogs were also posted on the Pioneer Girl Project website, pioneergirlproject.org. We maintained a healthy presence on social media as well, especially on Facebook and Twitter (@sdhspress), and added a Twitter handle for the journal (@sodakhistory).

Scott Ahola Frank AllenLiz Almlie Molly Daniel Jan DeisCindy EilersMargaret Jennings Tamara St. JohnDawn Tae Swanson John TeupelAnn Historical Society Foundation Board of DirectorsFOUNDATION 2021 was a year of transition. The announcement of several promising COVID-19 vaccines was a much-needed shot of good news. As leisure travel bounced back and consumer confidence began to return, so did spending. The Foundation's Heritage Stores beat profit expectations despite supply chain issues. Sales on South Dakota art, books, jewelry, unique gifts and more were up 125 percent over 2019. Fortunately, our vendors came through for us with their local products. In April, the governor's delegation of Her Vote. Her Voice. (HVHV) wrapped up the education and advocacy work of the women's history initiative. The next step is to start work on a statewide oral history project. A task force has been formed to serve as advisors for the project. We extend our gratitude to the HVHV corporate sponsors First PREMIER Bank / PREMIER Bankcard, BankWest, Lawrence & Schiller and Midco. A special thanks goes out to other generous supporters: F. L. Clarkson Family Foundation, Hon. Karen Schreier and Tim Dougherty, Linda Lea Viken and Hon. Jeffrey Viken, Steve Zellmer and Kitty Kinsman, Tim and Catherine Forsch and others. We found new ways to use technology to broaden our outreach and create greater access to history. The podcast \"History 605\" explores the history of South Dakota and the Midwest. State Historian Dr. Ben Jones interviews guests about books, artifacts and historic sites. The Scotty Philip Memorial Fund and the Florence and Marvin Hogan endowment funded 14 episodes. A special thank you goes out to other generous supporters, including the South Dakota Humanities Council, Gary and Connie Grittner for a gift to preserve the American Legion Post 8 cabin and leadership gifts from Dana and LaDawn Dykhouse, Curt and Kim Mortenson, Michael and Barbara Lewis, Dan and Arlene Kirby, Andre Roby and Cynthia Lillibridge. The board added a vital role to the Foundation team with the addition of Nancy Tapken, Strategic Partnership Developer. We encourage you to welcome her. Long-time staff member Dorinda Daniel retired in December. Dorinda served the State Historical Society and Foundation for 16 years. We congratulate her. Retiring from the Foundation board are Jack Weck and John Teupel. Weck served as vice president of the board. Teupel has been on the board since 2006 and served as board president from 2013 to 2018. We will miss their leadership and thank them for their service. Recently elected are Patricia Miller, president; Eric Jensen, vice president; Sue Gates, secretary and Val Simpson, treasurer. Additionally, two new members joined the board: Julie Breu and Tony Venhuizen. We are grateful to those who financially supported us during these turbulent times. Thank you. Your generosity and loyalty have inspired us. History has never been more important than it is right now. When the stories of this century are written, your unwavering commitment to preserving, educating and studying the past will be an outstanding example for future generations.
