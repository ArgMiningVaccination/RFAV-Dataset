DETERMINING DOSE AND CREATININE CLEARANCE: 1. Use of total body weight (TBW) in underweight and non -obese patients is widely accepted. Use of ideal body weight (IBW) for determining the mg/kg/dose may also be considered . For obese patients dosage requirement may best be estimated using an adjusted body weight (ABW) of: IBW + 0.4 (TBW - IBW) .1 IBW (male) = 50 kg + (2.3 x height in inches > 60 inches) IBW (female) = 45 kg + (2.3 x height inches > 60 inches) 2. Calculate creatinine clearance with the Cockcroft -Gault equation using an ideal body weight (IBW) or an adjusted body weight (ABW) if the patient is obese CrCL (mL/min) = (140 - age) x IBW ( for females ) SCr x 72 II. AMINOGLYCOSIDE DOSING STRATEGIES A. Gram negative infections 1. High -dose Extended -Interval Therapy Rationale : Aminoglycoside bactericidal activity is generally regarded as concentration dependent.2,3 The higher the peak/MIC ratio, the greater the rate and extent of bacterial kill. The pharmacodynamic goal is to maximize drug concentrati on at the site of infection. Optim al bactericidal activity for the aminoglycosides is achieved when the exposure concentration is approximately 8 to 10 times the MIC . Existing data also supports area under the plasma concentration -time curve (AUC) / MIC ratio as an indicator of bacterial killing and efficacy. The AUC:MIC targets are for efficacy range from AUC/MIC ratios of 30 -50 in non -critically ill immunocompetent patients and upwards of 80 -100 for critically ill patients with infections of high -bacterial burden.4 Aminoglycosides exhibit a post -antibiotic effect (PAE).2,5-7 PAE ranges of 0.5 to 8 -hours have been reported. Factors influencing the PAE include: height of the preceding AMG peak, in -vivo > in -vitro, shortened by neutropenia, and extended in the presents of beta -lactams . Saturable aminoglycosides uptake in renal tubule cell and inner ear.8 This suggests that higher pea ks do not result in greater risk of toxicity. A single dose of aminoglycoside results in significantly lower renal cortical tissue concentration compared to the same total dose administered through a continuous infusion or in divided doses.9,10 . Modeling data sug gests that thrice -daily administration is associated with nephrotoxicity that occurs more rapidly, with greater intensity, and for longer duration, as compared to once -daily aminoglycoside.11 Clinical data and experience suggests that high -dose extended interval may be less nephrotoxicity compared to traditional regimens.12,13 The Hartford Nomogram method utilizes high -dose, once daily dosing to optimize the peak/MIC ratio in most clinical situations by administering a dose of 7mg/kg of either gentamicin or tobramycin. The Urban & Craig Nomogram is another method of ex tended - interval therapy utilizing 5 mg/kg of gentamicin or tobramycin in patients without renal dysfunction. For patients with cystic fibrosis exacerbation the Cystic Fibrosis consensus guidelines recommend extended interval dosing with 10 mg/kg once daily. Exclusion Criteria : Renal insufficiency (CrCl <30 mL/min or rapidly declining renal function) Pregnancy Synergy for gram -positive infections Ascites Burns (>20%) 2. Conventional / Traditional Dosing Tradition dosing of aminoglycosides includes lower doses with more frequent administration of aminoglycosides using pharmacokinetic parameters to determ ine dose and frequency to achieve target peak and trough values. Indication: Treatment of gram -negative infections and NOT a candidate for high -dose extended interval dosing therapy (see exclusion criteria above) B. Gram positive -synergy Synergy dosing is a low dose of aminoglycoside in conjunction with an antimicrobial agent that exhibits activity against the cell wall of Gra m- positive bacteria (i.e. beta -lactams, glycopeptides) for the treatment of Gram -positive infections C. Non-tuberculosis mycobacterium (NTM) Treatment of NTM either macrolides, clarithromycin, azithromycin, ethambut ol, rifamycin and possibly an aminoglycoside. The decision to add an aminoglycoside depends on multiple factors including the extensiveness of disease, drug - refractory/resistant profile, and drug tolerance. 2 Dosing Methods by Indication Indication for Aminoglycoside Gram 7 Consider -25 mg/kg 3 times weekly Consult ID Pharmacists for other indications not listed above (e.g. Nocardiosis, Listeriosis)Are there any contraindications for High -Dose Extended Dialysis -negative infections) A1 : Hartford Nomogram17 Initial Dose : 7 mg/kg using actual body weight (Nomogram was developed and validated with actual body weight ) If obese, use adjusted body weight .

Aiming for a level < 1 mcg/mL approximately 6 -hours prior to the next dose ensures there is a drug-free window in order to minimize drug accumulation within the proximal tubules. Maintenance random levels should be monitored at least once weekly .
