Introduction from the McLean County Community Health Council 's Executive Steering Committee The formation of the McLean County Community Health Council , and the decision for the four entities to collaborate to produce a joint community health needs assessment (CHNA) and joint community health improvement plan (CHIP) , in April 2015 , marked an important milestone for community health in McLean County. Prio r to th e formation of the Council , the two hospitals in McLean County and the McLean County Health Department each conducted their own community health needs assessment , resulting in three separate community health plans for the c ounty. At the same time, U nited Way of McLean County conducted a broad -based community needs assessment . To better serve the community, t he four organizations listed above decided to collaborate and develop a joint 2016 McLean County CHNA Report and joint McLean County 2017 - 2019 CHIP . For the 2019 and 2022 McLean County Community Health Needs Assessment, Chestnut Health Systems joined as a collaborative partner for th e joint report s. Chestnut Health Systems, like the hospitals, is required by federal guidelines to complete a comm unity health needs assessment every three years. a) Philosophy and Development of Collaborative All four organizations are members of the McLean County Community Health Council, which is dedicated to improving the health of the community and strongly belie ves in the philosophy of collaboration. Collaborating in a more effective manner was identified as the primary learning opportunity from the previous community health needs assessments. The involved organizations determined that the community health needs assessment for McLean County could be conducted more efficiently and effectively by pooling resources. Collaborating was also identified as the key for a successful implementation plan that would make impactful and sustainable community health improvements in McLean County. For the above reasons, the McLean County Community Health Council was formed for the creation of a joint community health needs assessment followed by one community health implementation plan for McLean County. b) Community Health Needs Assessment Report Approval Carle BroMenn Medical Center and OSF St. Joseph Medical Center are utilizing this joint CHNA Report, in conjunction with the McLean County Health Department and Chestnut Health Systems , to meet their 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment requirements under 501(r) added to the Internal Revenue Code by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. The McLean County Health Department will also utilize this report and subsequent community health implementat ion plan to meet IPLAN requirements for local health department certification by the Illinois Department of Public Health. Chestnut Health Systems is utilizing this report to meet the Health Resources & Services Administration's compliance expectation that Federally Qualified Health Centers complete a needs assessment at least once every three years for the purposes of informing and improving the delivery of health center services. Carle BroMenn Medical Center , the McLean County Health Department, OSF St . Joseph Medical Center and Chestnut Health Systems are the primary organizations responsible for guiding the 2023 - 2025 Community Health Improvement Plan that will be developed based upon this 2022 community health needs assessment. Like the 2020 - 2022 McLean County Community Health Improvement Plan, the 2023 - 2025 McLean County Community Health Improvement Plan will be developed in partnership with other community social service agencies and organizations. This plan was approved by Chestnut Health Systems ' Board of Directors on July 27, 2022 , Carle BroMenn Medical Center and Council on July 19, 2022 , the McLean County Board of Health on July 13, 2022 and OSF HealthCare System's Board of Directors on July 25, 2022 . II. Executive Summary Carle BroMenn Medical Center, Chestnut Health Systems , the McLean County Health Department and OSF St. Joseph Medical Center collaborated to conduct the 2022 McLean County Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) and to adopt a joint CHNA Report , just as they did in 2019 . This exciting and unique opportunity was possible, according to the final Treasury regulations adopted to implement 501(r), which was added to the Internal Revenue Code by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as all four entities define their service area as McLean County. The goals of th is collaborative effort are as follows: Analyze data collectively in conducting the CHNA Prioritize the significant health needs Generate the joint 2022 CHNA Report Work collaboratively to generate the joint 2023 - 2025 McLean County C ommunity Health Improvement Plan addressing each of the significant health needs or explaining why a significant health need is not being addressed. One member from each of the four organizations sits on the Executive Steering Committee that oversees all aspects of the Community Health Needs Assessment and Community Health Improvement Plan. The Executive Steering Committee falls under the umbrella of the McLean County Community Health Council which consists of 64 individuals representing 46 organizations from the following sectors : County and city government Education Public health Business/economic development Social services Faith Transportation Law enforcement Housing Civic organizations/service clubs Healthcare . In the fall and winter of 2021 - 2022 , the Executive Steering Committee analyze d the primary and secondary data , accumulated from a variety of sources, presented in this report. By considering the crit eria below, the Executive Steering Committee identified the significant health issues to present to the McLean County Community Health Council for prioritization. Size of the issue Rates worse than Illinois counties or state rate Disparities by race/ethni city, age and gender Disparities by ZIP code Percent of indic ators trend ing unfavorably in a statistically significant direction Does not meet Healthy People (HP) 2020 or HP 2030 target Does working on the issue impact other issues for collective impact? a) Seven Significant Health Needs Identified for Prioritization The seven significant health needs presented to the McLean County Community Health Council by the Executive Steering Committee for prioritization were: Access to Care Behavioral Health (mental health and substance use) Healthy Eating and Active Living (exercise, nutrition, obesity and food access/insecurity) Diabetes Heart Disease Oral Health Respiratory Disease . McLean County Community Health Council Prioritization Meetings The Executive Steering Committee facilitated t hree virtual meetings , due to the COVID -19 pandemic, of the McLean County Community Health Council to prioritiz e the health needs derived from the data analysis: January 27, 2022 The purpose of the first meet ing was to explain the collaborative nature of the joint 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment with Carle BroMenn Medical Center, the McLean County Health Department, OSF St. Joseph Medical Center and Chestnut Health Systems and the end goal of producing a joint community health improvement p lan for McLean County. Annual Report highlights from 2020 and 2021 for the 2020 - 2022 McLean County Community Health Improvement Plan were reviewed with the council. February 10, 2022 During the second meeting, the Executive Steeri ng Committee presented data on the significant health needs identified for prioritization. Age, gender, race/ethnic ity and ZIP code disparities were shared when available. Data for the social determinants of health was also reviewed with t he council. Questions from council members were addressed throughout the data presentation. At the conclusion of the meeting, data summaries for the top seven health needs were emailed to the council members , in addition to the presentation given by the Ex ecutive Steering C ommittee during the meeting. February 24, 2022 During the final prioritization meeting, a prioritization method was used for the McLean County Community Health Council to the select the three significant health needs for the 2022 McLean County Community Health Needs Assessment and around which the 2023 - 2025 McLean County Co mmunity Health Improvement P lan will be developed. Health Needs Selected The following three significant health needs were selected by the McLean County Community Health Council to be addressed in the 2023 -2025 McLean County Community Health Improvement Plan : Access to Care Behavioral Health (including mental health and substance abuse) Healthy Eating/Active Living (exercise, nutrition, obesity and food ac cess/insecurity) Health Needs Not Selected The four health needs that were not selected were diabetes, heart disease, oral h ealth and respiratory disease. The council acknowle dged the importance of all four of these issues, but the prioritization scores f or the three selected issues were higher than those for the issues not selected. b) Priority Action Teams Assembled In April and May 2022 , three priority action team meetings were held to establish a high -level goal for each health priority. Priority ac tion teams consist ed of key community stakeholders with an interest or expertise in the prioritized significant health need . Cross -sector representation was sought for each priority action team. Priority action teams included current members working on int erventions for the 2020 - 2022 McLean County Community Health Improvement Plan and additional new members who will work on interventions for the 2023 - 2025 McLean County Community Health Improvement Plan. The goals for each of the health priorities identified are listed below: 2023 - 2025 Health Priority Goals Access to Care Advance and advocate for equitable and affirming access to care and other resources, which address social determinants of health, to improve the health and well -being of our diverse community by 2026. Behavioral Health Further equitable, inclusive, and integrated systemic community approaches to behavioral health and well -being for our diverse community by 2026. Healthy Eating/Active Living Promote equitable opportunities f or healthy eating and active living to strengthen the health and well -being of our diverse community by 2026. In the fall of 2022 , the priority action teams will meet to determine the resources, interventions and outcome metrics for each of the three heal th priorities . The 2023 - 2025 McLean County Community Health Improvement Plan will again be a joint plan for the entire county and consist of interventions and resources from the hospitals, health department, Chestnut Family H ealth Center and numerous social s ervice s or other community organizations.

January 31, 2019 At the first meeting , the Committee explai ned the collaborative nature of the 2019 McLean County Community Health Needs Assessment with Carle BroMenn Medical Center, the McLean County Health Department, OSF St. Joseph Medical Center and Chestnut Health Systems, and the end goal of producing a join t community health needs assessment report and community health impro vement plan for McLean County. Highlights from 2017 and 2018 for the 2017 - 2019 McLean County Community Health Improvement Plan were also reviewed with the council. February 14, 2019 During the second meeting, the Executive Steering Committee presented detailed data on the six significant health needs identified for prioritization. Age, gender, race/ethnic ity and ZIP code disparities were shared when available. A group discussion was facilitated on the health issues presented. February 28, 2019 During the final prioritization meeting, the Hanlon Method of prioritization was used to select the three significa nt health needs for the 2019 McLean County Community Health Needs Assessment and around which the 2020 - 2022 McLean County Community Health Improvement P lan w as developed. e) Health Needs Selected Access to Care Access to care was selected as a significant health need to be addressed by the McLean County Community Health Council not only because of its high priority score (160.3), but for other reasons , as well . Access to care is an important issue that affects many health outcomes. Improving access in certain areas and for certain populations can have a widespread impact on a variety of health outcomes ranging from oral health to respiratory disease. Data presented to the council also indicated that there are significant g eographic and racial/ethnic disparities in McLean County that may be related to access to care. Research and subject matter expertise suggested that there are a variety of factors that c an improve access to care ranging from increased hours of operation fo r urgent care clinics and primary care offices , to transportation and education of both consumers and providers. Access to care was also selected as a health priority for the 2016 McLean County Community Health Needs Assessment. Behavioral Health (Mental Health and Substance Abuse) Behavioral health was selected as a significant health need to be addressed by the McLean County Community Health Council for several reasons. Behavioral health received the highest priority score (162.5) , clearly indicating the need for further improvements . There are numerous health disparities in Bloomington ZIP code 61701 for both mental health and substance abuse. There has also been a great deal of public support and momentum behind mental health in McLean County for the last several years. McLean County is well situated to continue to build momentum on addressing mental health due to the ongoing efforts of numerous organizations and the McLean County Government. Mental health was also previously selec ted as a key health priority for the 2016 McLean County Community Health Needs Assessment . Healthy Eating/Active Living Healthy eating/active living was selected as a significant health need to be addressed by the McLean County Community Health Council b ecause it ranked as number three according to its priority score of 158.1. Additionally, the council felt that by focusing on healthy eating/active living, many other health outcomes such as heart disease, cancer and diabetes could be positively impacted. Additionally, obesity is a widespread issue that does not discriminate and affect s many people. Related issues of f ood insecurity and food access are also areas needing improvement in McLean County. Obesity was selected as a health priority for the 2016 Mc Lean County Community Health Needs Assessment. f) Health Needs Not Selected Heart Disease Heart disease was not selected as a significant health need because it was ranked fourth according to its priority score of 111.1 and the McLean County Community Health Council did not feel that there was a compelling reason to eliminate one of the health issues that ranked in the top three. The council did discus s that improving access to care may also improve health outcomes for heart disease, particularly in areas of high socioeconomic needs. Oral Health Although oral health was deemed an extremely important issue in McLean County, the McLean County Community Health Council agreed to address the three needs that received the highest priority scores. Oral health ranked fifth with a score of 107.7. The council discuss ed the fact that oral health is also an access issue and can fit under access to care initiatives . The opening of a new dental clinic at the Community Health Care Clinic in early 2019 for individuals without health insurance may assist in improving oral health care acce ss. Respiratory Disease Respiratory disease was given a priority score of 81.1 (ranking of sixth). T he McLean County Community Health Council did not feel that there was a compelling reason to eliminate one of the health concerns that ranked in the top three. The council did discuss that improving access to care may also improve health outcomes for respiratory disease, particularly in areas of high socioeconomic needs. g) Priority Action Teams Assembled In April and May 2019, three priority action team m eetings were held to establish a high -level goal for each significant health need/ health priority. Priority action teams consist ed of key community stakeholders with an interest or expertise in the prioritized significant health need. Cross -sector representation was sought for each priority action team. The goals for each of the health priorities identified are listed below: 2020 - 2022 Health Priority Goals Access to Care Ensure appropriate access to care to improve the health and well -being of our residents, neighborhoods and county by 2023. Behavioral Health Advance a systemic community approach to enhance behavioral health an d well -being by 2023. Healthy Eating/Active Living Promote healthy eating and active living to strengthen the health and well -being of our community by 2023. In the fall of 2019 , the priority action teams met to determine the resources, interventions and outcome metrics for each of the three health priorities. The 2020 - 2022 McLean County Community Healt h Improvement Plan was created as a joint plan for the entire county and consist ed of interventions and resources from the hospitals, health department, family health center and numerous social services or other community organizations. h) Summary of 2020 - 2022 McLean County Community Health Improvement Plan Key Accomplishments A summary of accomplishments for 2020 and/or 2021 from the McLean County Community Health Improvement Plan are listed below .

The joint CHNA R eport was posted on the websites of both hospitals, the McLean County H ealth Department s and Chestnut Health Systems . The 2020 - 2022 McLean County Community Health Improvement Plan was posted either on each organizations' website or attached to the hospital' s annual Form 990 . Although feedback was not given by individuals in th e community via the se formal mechanisms, informal/ verbal feedback was provided from key stakeholders and community service organizations. Consistently, stakeholders commented on the benefits of having a joint community health needs assessment and community health improvement plan. Several organizations utilized the information in the joint CHNA r eport to apply for grants to help further the work of their agencies. Feedback was received that the CHNA report has been of great value to McLean County. j) Lessons Learned A lesson learned from the 2019 McLean County Community Health Needs Assessment is that the time it took to conduct a CHNA, to complete a joint CHNA Report and to adopt a joint Community Health Improvement Plan was underestimated. It take s a firm and ongoing commitment from at least one key player from each Executive Steering Committee organization to prepare a joint CHNA report as well as provide cross -sector organizational support and community participation. A joint community health nee ds assessment has been conducted in McLean County for three cycles. With e ach cycle, m ore individuals from various organizations want to be a part of the process whether that means being a council member or a member of a priority action team. While it impo rtant to hear the voices of new community members, it proves more challenging and time consuming to manage larger groups. It is also challenging to share all of the robust data with the council, priority action team s and other interested groups. V. 2022 McLean County Community Health Needs Assessment a) Methodology To complete the comprehensive community health needs assessment, multiple sources were examined. Secondary statistical data were used to assess the community profile, morbidity rates and causes of mortality. Additionally, based on a sample of 763 survey respondents from McLean County, a study was compl eted to examine perceptions of community health -related issues, healthy behaviors, behavioral health, food security, social determinants of health and access to healthcare. When available, each section of the report provides prevalence or incidence rates , comparisons to state, national and Healthy People 2020 or 2030 targets, trend s and/or prior value s for McLean County and disparities data. Key findings can be found at the end of each major data category. Secondary Data Existing secondary data was use d to develop an overall assessment of health -related issues in the community. The report contains the most recent data available at the time of data collection which was presented in February 2022 to the McLean County Community Health Council as part of the prioritization process for this community health needs assessment . Much of the secondary data used for this assessment was acquired via Conduent Healthy Communities Institute , a centralized dat a platform purchased by Carle Health to help drive community health improvement efforts . Conduent Healthy Communities Institute operates as a repository for publicly available secondary data , hospital emergency room visits and hospitalization rates. The platform includes dashboards, Geographic Information System ( GIS) maps, disaggregation at the ZIP code level, disparities information and effective practices for over 100 health -related issues. Conduent Healthy Communities Institute also supplies a colorful gauge to depict comparisons between McLean County, other counties in Illinois and US counties . See Exhibit 2 below. Exhibit 2: Conduent Healthy Communities Institute Gauges Green (Good): When a high value is good, community value is e qual to or higher than the 50th percentile (median) -- OR - when a low value is good, community value is equal to or lower than 50th percentile Yellow (Fair): When a high value is good, community value is between 50th and 25th percentile -OR - when a low value is good, community value i s between 50th and 75th percentiles Red (Poor): When a high value is good, community value is less than 25th percentile - OR - when a low value is good, community value is greater than 75th percentile Source: Conduent Hea lthy Communities Institute, 2022 . See Appendix 2 for a detailed explanation of additional icons and gauges used throughout this report. A comprehensive list of secondary data sou rces can be found in Appendix 3. Primary Data In addition to existing secondary data sources, primary survey data were also collected. See Appendix 4 to view the survey. This section describes the research methods used to collect, code, verify and analyze primary survey data. Specifically, the resear ch design used for this study includes : survey design, data collection and data integrity as outlined below . Survey Instrument Design Initially, all publicly available health needs assessments in the US were assessed to identify common themes and approaches to collecting community health needs data. By leveraging best practices from these surveys , a collaborative team was involved in survey design/approval through several factfinding sessions. Additionally, several focus groups were used to coll ect the qualitative information necessary to design survey items. Specifically, for the community health needs assessment, eight specific sets of items were included: 1) Ratings of health issues in the community - to assess the importance of various communit y health concerns. Survey items included assessments of topics such as cancer, diabetes, viruses (including COVID -19) and obesity. 2) Ratings of unhealthy behaviors in the community - to assess the importance of various unhealthy behaviors. Survey items inclu ded assessments of topics such as violence, drug abuse and smoking. 3) Ratings of issues concerning well -being - to assess the importance of various issues relating to well -being in the community. Survey items included assessments of topics such as access to healthcare, safer neighborhoods and effective public transportation. 4) Accessibility to healthcare - to asse ss the degree to which residents could access healthcare when needed. Survey items included assessments of topics such as access to medical, dental and mental healthcare, as well as access to prescription medications. 5) Healthy behaviors - to assess the degr ee to which residents exhibited healthy behaviors. The survey items included assessments of topics such as exercise, healthy eating habits and cancer screenings. 6) Behavioral health - to assess community issues related to conditions such as anxiety and depr ession. 7) Food security - to assess access to healthy food alternatives. 8) Social determinants of health - to assess the impact that social determinants may have on the abovementioned topics . Finally, demographic information was collected to assess background information necessary to segment markets in terms of the eight categories discussed above. Item selection criteria for the final survey included validity, reliability and frequency measures based on responses from the pilot sample. Sample Size To p rovide a representative profile when assessing the aggregated population of McLean County, the general population was combined with a portion of the at -risk population. To represent the at -risk population as a percentage of the aggregate population, a random -number generator was used to select at -risk cases to include in the general sample. Additionally, efforts were made to ensure that the demography of the sample was aligned with population demographics according to U.S. Census data. This provided a t otal usable sample of 763 respondents for ana lyzing the aggregate population; 650 from the general pop ulation and 113 from the at -risk population. Data Collection To collect data in this study, two techniques were used. First, an online version of the survey was created. Second, a paper version of the survey was distributed. In order to be sensitive to the needs of respondents, surveys stressed assurance of complete anonymity. Both versions were translated into Spanish and collected from August through September 2021. See Appendix 4 for the survey instrument. In addition to defining the community by geographic boundaries, this study target ed the at -risk population as an area of potential opportunity to improve the health of the community. Note that t he at -risk population was defined as those individuals eligible to receive Medicaid based on the state of Illinois guidelines using household size and income level. To specifically target the at -risk population, surveys were distributed at homeless shelter s, food pantries and other social service organizations. Since the at -risk population was specifically targeted as part of the data collection effort, this became a stratified sample, as no other groups were specifically targeted based on their socio -econo mic status. It is important to recognize that the use of electronic surveys to collect community -level data may create a potential for bias f rom convenience sampling error. To recognize for potential bias in the community sample, a second control sample of data was collected. Specifically, the control sample consisted of random patients surveyed at a hospital, assuming that patients receiving care represent an unbiased representation of the community. All questions on the patient version of the survey pe rtaining to access to healthcare were removed, as these questions were not relevant to current patients. Data from the community sample and the control sample were compared using t -tests and tetrachoric correlations when appropriate. Results show ed that th e community sample did not exhibit any significan t patterns of bias. If specific relationships exhibited a potential for bias between the community sample and the control sample, they were identified in the social -determi nants sections of the analyses . Comparisons with 201 8 Community Health Needs Assessment Survey Throughout the report, the 2021 McLean County Community Health Survey is compared to the 201 8 McLean County Community Health Survey. b) Community Description The McLean County Community Health Council defined the community as McLean County, the primary service area for Carle BroMenn Medical Center , the McLean County Health Department, OSF St. Joseph Medical Center and Chestnut Family Health Center . This area in cludes t he following cities McLean, Merna, Normal, Saybrook, Stanford and Towanda. See Exhibit 3 below for a map of McLean County. Exhibit 3: McLean County Community Map Source: McLean County Re gional Planning Commission, 2022 . Population McLean County consists of a total population of 174,090 (Conduent Healthy Communit ies Institute, Claritas, 2022 ). Bloomington has the largest population in the county with 77,962 and Normal has the second largest population with 54,742 (Conduent Healthy Communities Institute, U.S. Census Bureau , 2018) . The population in McLean County increased by 2.66 percent from 2010 to 2022 (Conduent Healthy Communities Institute , Claritas, 20 22). Social Determinants of Health: Health Equity Index The Health Equity Index (formerly called the SocioN eeds I ndex) is a Conduent Healthy Communities Institute (HCI) tool that measures socioeconomic need, which is correlated with poor health outcomes . The index is part of the Conduent's SocioNeeds Index\u00ae Suite , which provides analytics around social determinants of health to advance equitable outcomes for a range of topics. Conduent HCI's Health Equity I ndex considers validated indicators related to income, employment, education, and household environment to identify areas at highest risk for experie ncing health inequities . The indicators are weighted to maximize the correlation of the index with premature death rates and preventable hospitalization rates. All ZIP codes, counties, and county equivalents in the United States are given an index value fr om 0 (low need) to 100 (high need). To help identify the areas of highest need within a defined geographic area, the selected ZIP codes are ranked from 1 (low need) t o 5 (high need) based on their i ndex value. These values are sorted from low to high and d ivided into five ranks using natural breaks. These ranks are used to color the map and chart for the Health Equity Index, with darker coloring associated with higher relative need. McLean County has several communities that have a greater risk of experiencing health inequities or have a higher relative need compared to other communities in the county . The Health Equity Index for McLean County is illustrated in Exhibit 4. McLean County has two ZIP code s with a ranking of 5 and eight ZIP codes with a ranking of 4, which represent the area s with the highest relative need in McLean Count y. Normal, with a population of 52,707 is a major city in McLean County with a ranking of 3. Since it is not one of the highest Health Equity Needs ZIP codes in McLean County, data specific to Normal is not included in the table below or highlighted in this report.

A preliminary review of McLean County Health Department vital records data for January through November 2021 indicates a similar pattern in the leading causes of dea th: heart disease, mal ignant neoplasms, COVID -19 and chronic lower respiratory diseases (McLean County Health Department, Vital Records, preliminary data, 2021). The State of Illinois tracks injury deaths, which includes three categories: 1) accidents (poisoning; firearm; falls; motor vehicle traffic; suffocation; drowning; fire), 2) suicide; and 3) homicide. Poisoning is the leading cause of injury death in Illinois with 3,462 deaths in 2020, followed by falls (1,356 deaths) and motor vehicle traffic ( 1,266 deaths) (Illinois Department of Public Health, Death Statistics, Injury Deaths, Illinois Residents, 2020). In McLean County, deaths by injury (including accidents, suicide and homicide) from 2010 through 2020 ranged from a low of 46 (2011) in one year to a high of 111 (2020). Death by accidents ranged from a low of 30 (2011) to a high of 80 (2017). Death by suicide ranged from a low of 14 (2011) to a high of 26 (2013 and 2020).

Three areas in McLean County that have a high Health Equity Needs ZIP code, also report having a higher percentage of obesity. o e o Colfax ZIP code 61728: 36 percent o Ellsworth ZIP code 61737 : 36 percent Approximately 9.6 percent of eighth, tenth and twelft h grade students are obese in McLean County. 0510152025 8th Grade Students 10th Grade Students 12thDays Axis Title Zero Days 1-2 Days 3-5 Days 6-7 Days 217.7231.6 050100150200250 Moderate Levels (Males) Moderate Levels (Females)Exercise Minutes/Week Moderate Levels Vigorous Levels Twenty percent of the adult population indicated that they do not exercise at all . An average of 27 percent of McLean County eighth, tenth and twelfth graders were physically active for at least 60 minutes for five days during the past seven days. f) Social Determinants of Health Built Environment Physical Activity According to the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, \"t he built environment describes physical or manmade features such as sidewalks, streetlights, traffic and parks that may promote or discourage activity. \" The built environment is important to consider when assessing physical acti vity as there is strong evidence suggesting an association between access to recreational resources, bik eability and walkability of neighborhoods as well as safe, aesthetically pleasing environments with increased physical activity and reduced obesity rate s (Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, Built Environment and Physical Activity, 2007). In McLean County, 83.9 percent of residents have access to exercise opportunities, meaning they live reasonably close to a park or recreational facility. McLean County fal ls in the best 0 - 50th percentile range (green indicator) when compared to other counties in Illinois for access to exercise opportunities , despite the county's rural expanse. It is lower than the Illinois value of 90.8 percent (Conduent Healthy Communiti es Institute, Cou nty Health Rankings, 2020 ). According to the U.S. Department of Agricult ure Food Environment Atlas, 2016 , there are 0.12 recreation and fitness centers per 1,000 population in McLean County, more than the national average of 0.06 per 1,0 00 population . Nationally, only 0.5 percent of American workers, 16 years and older, commute to work by bicycle . In Illinois the percent is 0.5 while the percent for McLean County is 0.6 (U.S. Census Bureau, 2016 -2020 American Community Survey 5 -Year Estimates). Food Security and Access to Food Food Environment Index The food environment index combines two measures of food access: the percentage of the population that is low - income and has low access to a grocery store, and the percentage of the population that did not have access to a reliable source of food during the past year (food insecurity). The index ranges from 0 (worst) to 10 (best) and equally weights the two measures . The food environment index for McLean County is 8.1 which is in the best 0 - 50th percentile range (green indicator) compared to other counties in Illinois . It is worse , however, than the Illinois index of 8.7 but better than the prior value for McLean County in 2018 of 7.7 . The index for McLean County is trending favorabl y but is not statistically significant. (Conduent Healthy Communities Institute, County Healt h Rankings, 2021 ). See Exhibit 44 below. Exhibit 44: Food Environment Index - McLean County , 2020 - 2021 McLean County 8.1 Source: Conduent Healthy Communities Institu te, County Health Rankings, 2021 . Grocery Store Density McLean County falls in the worst 50th - 75th percentile range (yellow indicator) in comparison to other counties in Illinois for grocery store density with 0.16 supermarkets and grocery stores per 1,000 population (Conduent Healthy Communities Institute, U.S. Department of Agriculture - Food Environment Atlas, 2016). This is the same as the 2014 value for Mc Lean County. See Exhibit 45 below. Exhibit 45 : Grocery Store Density - McLean County , 2014 - 2016 McLean County 0.16 Stores / 1,000 population Source: Conduent Healthy Communities Institute, U.S. Department of Agricult ure-Food Environment Atlas, 2016 . People with Low Access to a Grocery Store The percentage of the general population living more than one mile from a supermarket or large grocery store if in an urban area, or more than 10 miles from a supermarket or large grocery store if in a rural area in McLean County is 27.4 percent. This is in t he worst 25th percentile range (red indicator) compared to other counties in Illinois and equal to the prior value for McLean County of 27.4 percent (Conduent Healthy Communities, U.S. Department of Agriculture - Food Environment Atlas, 2015). See Exhibit 46 below. Additionally, an area located west of Main St. in Bloomington ZIP code 61701 was designated by the U.S. Department of Agriculture as a food desert (City of Bloomington Existing Conditions Report, 2014). Exhibit 46: People with L ow Access to a Grocery Store - McLean County , 2010 - 2015 McLean County 27.4 % Source: Conduent Healthy Communities, U.S. Department of Agriculture - Food Environment Atlas, 2015 . Access to a Grocery Store for Low -income Adults Low access is defined as living more than one mile from a supermarket or large grocery store if in an urban area and more than 10 miles from a supermarket or large grocery store if in a rural area. The percentage of low -income adults who do not have adequate access to a grocery store or supermarket in McLean County is 9.8 percent. McLean County is in the worst 25th percentile range (red indicator) for this measure when compared to other counties in Illinois. This is higher than the value of 8.2 percent for McLean County in 2010 (Conduent Healthy Communities Institute, U.S. Department of Agriculture - Food Environment Atlas, 2015). See Exhibit 47 below.

Department of Agriculture - Food Environment Atlas, 2015 . Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) Certified Stores SNAP, previously called the Food Stamp Program, is a federal assistance pr ogram that provides low -income families with electronic benefit transfers (EBTs) that can be used to purchase food. The purpose of the program is to assist low - income households in obtaining adequate and nutritious diets. According to the program, over 45 million people from over 20 million households receive SNAP benefits (Conduent Healthy Communities, 2022). There are 0.7 stores/1,000 population in McLean County that are certified to accept SNAP benefits . This is in the worst 50th - 75th percentile range (yellow indicator) in comparison to other counties in Illinois. Over time , the McLean County value is increasing, but not significantly (Conduent Healthy Communities, U.S. Department of Agriculture - Food Environment Atlas, 2017). Fast Food Restaurant De nsity The fast food restaurant density is in the worst 25th percentile range (red indicator) compared to other counties in Illinois ( see Exhibit 48) with 0.81 fast food restaurants per 1,000 in McLean County . It is trending unfavorably but is not statistically significant and is greater than the 2014 value for McLean County of 0.73 restaurants per 1,000 population. (Conduent Healthy Communities Institute, U.S. Department of Agriculture - Food Environment Atlas, 2016).

Farmers ' Market Density There are 0.02 Farmers ' Markets per 1,000 population in McLean County (Conduent Healthy Communities Institute, U.S. Department of Agriculture - Food Environment Atlas, 2018). This is worse than the U.S. value of 0.03 markets/1,000 population. Over tim e the value is decreasing, but not significantly. Food Ins ecurity Food Insecurity Index Conduent Healthy Communities Institute 's Food Insecurity Index considers validated indicators related to income, household environment, and well -being to identify areas at highest risk for experiencing food insecurity. The national index value (from 0 to 100) is calculated for each ZIP code, census tract, and county in the U.S. Communities . The highest index values are estimated to have the highest food ins ecurity, which is correlated with household and community measures of food -related financial stress such as Medicaid and SNAP enrollment. Ranks and colors help to identify the relative level of need within a community or service area. The national index va lue for each location is compared to all other similar locations within the community area to assign a relative rank (from 1 to 5) locally. These ranks are used to color the map and chart for the Food Insecurity Index, with darker coloring assoc iated with higher relative need (Conduent Healthy Communities Institute, 2021). See Exhibit 49 below for the Food Insecurity Index for McLean County. Exhibit 49 : Food Insecurity Index - McLean County, Conduent Health Communities Institute, 2021 Source: Conduent Healthy Communities, 2021 McLean County has two ZIP codes with a ranking of 5, or the highest relative need, in the county : Bloomington ZIP code 61701 and Colfax ZIP code 61728. Three othe r ZIP codes have a ranking of 4: Stanford ZIP code 61774, Gridley ZIP code 61744 and Chenoa ZIP code 61726. The above areas are estimated to have the highest food insecurity in McLean County. Food I nsecurity : Adults and Children The percentage of the population that experienced food insecurity in McLean County at some point during 201 9 is 9.5 percent (Conduent Healthy Communities Institute, Feeding America, 2019 ). This rate is in the best 0 - 50th percentile range ( green indicator) compared to other counties in Illinois and lower than the Illinois rate of 9.5 percent. It is , however, higher than the prior value for McLean County (2018 ) and is trending favorably albeit not statistically significant. See Exhibit 50 below for an illustration of the data stated above. Exhibit 50: Food Insecurity Rate - McLean County , 2018 - 2019 McLean County 9.5% Source: Conduent Healthy Co mmunities, Feeding America, 2019 . The percentage of children (under 18 years of age) living in households that experienced food insecurity at some point during 2019 is 9.5 percent (Conduent Healthy Communities Institute, Feeding America, 201 9). This is in the best 0 - 50th percentile range (green indicator) compared to other counties in Illinois , lower than the Illinois value of 12 percent and lower than the 2018 value of 10.7 percent. The percent of food insecure children in households with incomes above 185 percent of the federal poverty level who are likely not income -eligible for federal nutrition assistance in McLean County is 31 percent. This is in the wo rst 25th percentile range (red indicator) in comparison to other counties in Illinois. It is also higher than the 2018 value of 23 percent (Conduent Healthy Communities Institute, Feedin g America, 2019). See Exhibit 51 below for an illustration of this dat a.

McLean County Community Health Survey and Food Insecurity Survey respondents for the 2021 McLean County Community Health Survey indicated that two percent go hungry one to two days/week and one percent go hungry three to five days/week. See Exhibit 52 below for an illustration for frequency of hunger . Exhibit 52 : Responses for \"How Often Do You Go Hungry ?\" McLean County Survey Respondents , 2021 Source: McLean County Community Health Survey , 2021 Social Determinants of Health Correlations Several characteristics show a significant relationship with frequency of hunger. The following relationships were found using correlational analyses: Frequency of hunger tends be rated higher by men, younger people, those with lower education and income and those with an unstable (e.g. homeless) housing environment. Comparison to the 2018 McLean C ounty Community Health Survey In 2018, 96 percent of survey respondents reported that they did not go hungry. This is one percent lower than the 2021 survey results. Three percent reported that they go hungry one to two days/week which is one percent higher than in 2021.

In McLean County, 42.8 percent of renters are spending 30 percent or more of their income on hou sing or rent. This is in the best 0 - 50th percentile range (green indicator) compared to other counties in Illinois and is low er than the Illinois value of 47 percent. Over time the McLean County value is decreasing significantly (Conduent Healthy Communities Institute, American Community Survey, 2016 - 2020).

In Illinois, from 2005 to 2014, the age -adjusted rate of fall deaths increased from 27.9 per 100,000 in 2005 to 45.7 per 100,000 in 2014. In 2014, the fall death rate in males was approximately 70 times higher than in females. The highest rate increase was among person s ages 85 and over ( Illinois Department of Public Health, Older Adult Falls, Special Emphasis Report: Fall Injuries Among Older Adults, 2008 - 2014, January 2017). In the United States, in 2014 - 2017, unintentional falls accounted for 13 percent of emerg ency department visits by people ages 60 and over. The percentage increased with age: 10 percent of visits by people ages 60 - 69; 12 percent for those ages 70 - 79; 17 percent by those ages 80 -89; and, 25 percent for people ages 90 and over (Center for D isease Control and Prevention, National Center for Health Statistics, Data Brief, June 2020). Hip fractures are often the result of falls. In McLean County, females ages 65 and above had a hip fracture hospitalization rate of 492 hospitalizations per 100, 000 females ages 65 and over (2018 - 2020) which met and exceeded the Healthy People 2020 target of 741.2, but was above the Illinois rate of 479.3. The rate for males in McLean County in the same age group was 317.2 (2018 - 2020), and although it met the Healthy People 2020 target of 418.4, it was worse than the Illinois rate of 280.2, and was in the 50th to 75th percentile (yellow indicator) compared to other counties in Illinois ( Conduent Healthy Communities Institute, 2018 - 2020). The Matter of Balan ce Program, hosted locally by Community Care Systems, Inc., is a grant -funded evidence -based program designed to reduce fear of falling and increase activity levels in older adults who are concerned about falling. The program includes eight two -hour classe s presented to a group of 8 - 12 participants by trained coaches (Nat ional Council on Aging, 2022). The most recent McLean County session graduated 13 participants on March 3, 2022 at the Activity and Recreation Center in Normal ; mor e sessions are planned in 2022. Rush University Medical Center tracks results for Illinois programs . Participant satisfaction results from those completing the eight -week program (data from all host sites) include d the following : 96 percent feel more satisfied with life; 97 percent feel more comfortable increasing activity and 99 percent plan to continue to exercise (Matter of Balance Program statistics, Rush University, Chicago, 2019). School Safety /Climate School Crime Incidents This indicator shows the number of cr iminal offenses including attacks against school personnel, drug incidents, and firearm incidents reported by law enforcement officials. The offense need not have occurred on school grounds or during the academic school day. The number of school crime inci dent s in McLean County in 2020 was 15. This is lower than the 2019 number of incidents of 52 (Conduent Healthy Communities Institute, Illinois State Police, 2020 ). Over time the McLean County value is increasing, but not significantly. Results from the 2020 Illinois Youth Survey show that an average of approximately five percent of eighth, tenth and twelfth graders in McLean County strongly disagree or disagree with the statement, \"I feel safe at my school \". Exhibit 65 below shows the r esponses for the following statement, \"During the past 30 days, how many days did you not go to school because you felt you would be unsa fe?\" Exhibit 65 : Missing School Due to Feeling Unsafe - McLean County , 2020 N = 738 students 8 th graders 10th graders 12th graders 0 days 86% 93% 96% 1 day or 5 days 100% 100% * 100% * Please note, total for 8th and 10th graders is 101 percent, h owever, data reflected in the table is taken directly from t he 2020 Illinois Youth Survey.

Social /Family Environment Adverse Childhood Experiences Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) is the term used to describe all types of abuse, neglect and other p otentially traumatic experiences that occur to people under the age of 18. ACEs include: Physical abuse Sexual abuse Emotional abuse or neglect Physical neglect Intimate partner violence Mother treated violently Substance misuse within household Household mental illness Parental separation or divorce Incarcerated household member . Adverse Childhood Experiences have been linked to : Risky health behaviors Chronic health conditions Low life potential Early death . Exhibit 67 below illustrates ACE's data for Illinois. According to the results, almost 60 percent of non -institutionalized adults say they had at least one ACE (Illinois Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, Illinois Department of Public Health, 2013) . Exhibit 67: Adverse Childhood Experience - Illinois , 2013 Source: Illinois Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, Illinois Department of Public Health, 2013 . Child Abuse and Neglect McLean County's substantiated child abuse rate (number of children under the age of 18 that experienced abuse or neglect) is 10.8 cases per 1,000 children (2015). This rate is in the best 0 - 50th percentile range (green indicator) when compared to other counties in Illinois but is higher than the Illinois rate of 9.7 cases pe r 1,000 children and higher than the McLean County 2014 value of 9.4 cases per 1,000 children. McLean County's substantiated child abuse rate does not meet the Healthy People 2030 target of 8.7 cases per 1,000 children. Over time, he rate for McLean County is trending in a favorable direction and is statistically significant (Conduent Healthy Communities Institute, Illinois Department of Children and Family Services, 2015). See Exhibit 68 below. Exhibit 68: Su bstantiated Child Abuse Rate - McLean County , 2010 - 2015 McLean County 10.8 cases / 1,000 children Source: Conduent Healthy Communities Institute, Illinois Department of Children and Family Services, 2015 . Children in State Custody As of May 31, 2022, McLean County had a total of 242 youth in care, with 123 in foster care , 111 with a relative and another eight children in other living arrangements. The number, which changes daily, has been decreasing after a peak of over 300 children in care in 2012 (Illinois Department of Children and Family Services, Reports and Statistics, Monthly Data Reports, 2020, https://www2.illinois.gov/dcfs/abou tus/newsandreports/reports/Pages/default.aspx ). The HealthWorks Lead Agency and Medical Case Management Program at the McLean County Health Department is a collaborative effort between the Illinois Department of Human Services and the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services. Its purpose is to assure that wards of the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services from birth to six years of age as well as pregnant youth who are in substitute care, receive comprehensive quality health care services. The McLean County Health Department provides medical case managers who deliver follow -up services and maintain complete m edical records for each child. For 2021, HealthWorks Lead Agency oversaw the medical case management of 243 children per mont h on average. Case numbers per month ranged from 229 to 258. In Illinois in fiscal year 2021, the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services reported (Illinois Department of Children and Family Services, Budget Briefing Fiscal Year 2023, 2022 Ins pector General Report, data as of December 31, 2021, www.illinoiscasa.org ): 22,357 children and youth, ages zero to 21 were in state custody as of June 30, 2021 200,607 hotline calls were received 86,738 child a buse and neglect investigations were conducted 146,125 child victims associated with the investigations of abuse and neglect 6,814 children entered foster care 4,163 families were served as of June 30, 2021 in the preservation program keeping children at h ome 122 children died in 2021 as a result of abuse and neglect. Physical Environment - Air, Water, Radon, Lead and Hazardous Waste Air The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that outdoor air quality has improved since the 1990's, but ground -level ozone and particle pollution remain as key threats to air quality. Poor air quality can exacerbate existing conditions such as a sthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and heart disease (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Air Quality, 2022) . Air quality data is collected by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the American Lung Association summarizes i t and assigns grades, A - F (A=1; B=2; C=3; D=4; F=5), based on the average annual number of days ozone and particulate levels exceed U.S. standards during a three -year measurement period. (Conduent Healthy Communities Institute, American Lung Association , 2017 - 2019). Particle Pollution Inhaling particulates can negatively impact health by exacerbating lung condition s and cardiovascular diseases. Smaller particulates produce more damage. McLean County remains in the best 0 - 50th percentile range (gre en indicator) for particle pollution in comparison to other counties in Illinois (Conduent Healthy Communities Institute, American Lung Association, 20 17 - 2019), with a score of 1, meaning on average, McLean County exceeds U.S. standards one day per year for particle pollution during a three -year measurement period. See Exhibit 69 . Exhibit 69 : 3-Year Meas urements for Particle Pollution - McLean County, 2017 - 2019 McLean County One day/year Source: Conduent Healthy Communities Institute, American Lung Association, 201 7 - 2019. Ozone Ozone can affect the respiratory tract, exacerbating existing lung disea ses and inflaming lung tissue. Everyone is susceptible to ozone; however, children, people ages 65 and ove r and individuals with current lung disease tend to be more sensitive to ozone. When volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and nitrogen oxides (NO) react in sunlight, ground -level ozone is formed. Both VOCs and NOs are found in the emissions from vehicles, f actories, and motorized vehicles. McLean County is in the best 0 - 50th percentile range (green indicator), with a score of 2, in comparison to other counties in Illinois (Conduent Healthy Communities Institute, American Lung Association, 2017 - 2019) and ozone rates have remained steady from 2013 - 2019. See Exhibit 70 for an illustration of this data. Exhibit 70 : Three -Year Measurements of Ozone Air Quality - McLean County, 2007 - 2019 Source: Source: Conduent Healthy Communities Institute, American Lung Association, 201 7 - 2019. Carcinogens Released in the Air According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency , in 2020 , eight pounds of recognized carcinogens were released into the air in McLean County , placing it in the best 0 - 50th percentile range (green indicator) in comparison to other counties in Illinois. The data indicates that, over time, the McLean County val ue has decreased significantly. The eight pounds released each year since 2016 is a significant improvement from the prior value of 2,061 pounds in 2015 (Conduent Healthy Communities Institute, U.S. Environme ntal Protection Agency, 2020). See Exhibit 71 . Exhibit 71 : Recognized Carcinogens Released into Air \u2014McLean County, 2010 - 2020 Source: Conduent Healthy Communities Institute, Environmental Protection Agency, Recognized Carcinogens Released , 2020. The Air Quality Index The Air Quality Index (AQI) is used for reporting the overall daily quality of the air humans breathe , using a value from 0 to 50 0. It is the national standard of measurement method for reporting air pollution levels to the public (AirNow, Air Quality Index - A Guide to Air Quality and Your Health, www.airnow.gov/index.cfm?action=aqibasics.aqi ). As the Air Quality Index rises, the level of health concern increases: Good (0 -50), Moderate (51 -100), Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups (101 -150), Unhealthy (151 -200), Very Unhealthy (201 -300), and Hazardous ( 301-500). It is based on the federal National Ambient Air Quality Standards for the pollutants that serve as the five main indices of air quality, including sulfur dioxide (SO) , carbon monoxide (CO) , particulate matter (PM), nitrogen oxide s (NOs) and volat ile organic compounds (VOCs), which contribute to the creation of harmful ground -level ozone . A problematic Air Quality Index would be an AQI of greater than 100. Of the few days where an AQI greater than 100 was reached in McLean County, it was not consid ered statistically signifi cant. In Central Illinois, statistics indicate the AQI for CO, NO, PM, SO and VOCs in the past five years wer e highest in the Peoria region (Illinois Environmental Protection Agency, Air Quality Reports by Year, Statewide Summary of Point Source Emissions, pp. 23 s tations for the five main indices of air quality are located throughout Illinois, including Central Illinois: Champaign County : Total land = 997 square miles Main economy: farming /agriculture, some light industrial/logistics, health care and educational institutions (the University of Illinois and Parkland C ommunity College ) Location of air sampling devices : Washington Elementary Schoo l, 606 E. Grove Street, Champaign, Illinois. McLean County : Total land = 1189 sq uare miles Main economy: farming/agricultural, insurance, some light and heavy industrial manufacturing ( e.g., Bridgestone Tire; Rivian truck manufacturing ), and educational institutions (Illinois State University, Illinois Wesleyan University, and Heartland C ommunity College ) Location of air sampling devices : Illinois State University Physical Plant , Main and Gregory St reet, Normal, Illinois . Peoria County : Total land = 630 sq uare miles Main economy: heavy and light industrial manufacturing ( e.g., Caterpillar ), several logistics and associated support businesses , heavy transport with barges and highways, tourism/entertainment Location of air sampling devices : Fire Station #8 , Hurlbert and MacArthur , Peoria Heights High School, 508 E. Grove Street. Peoria Heights, Illinois . The statistics for the 2019 Air Quality Index record year shows the sector representing Normal, Illinois was rated as \"Good\" 70.3 percent and \"Moderate\" 29.7 percent for the year. There was no noticeable trend toward an Air Quality Index of \"Unhealthy for Sen sitive Groups\" in McLean County for the past five years. Residents in McLean County, overall, have very good air quality index exposures as com pared to surrounding counties. Exhibit 72 below provides an overview of the percent of days in Normal, Illinois, that air quality was \"Good\" or \"Moderate\" in comparison to Peoria and Champaign during the seven -year period of 2013 - 2019. Exhibit 72 : Air Quality Index - Normal, IL; Champaign, IL; Peoria, IL; Percent of Days Air -2019 Peoria Normal Champaign Source: Illinois Environmental Protection Agency, Air Quality Reports by Year, Statewide Summary of Point Source Emissions, pp.23 -28 Since VOCs are primarily generated, based on State of Illinois d ata, as a result of the f ood/ agriculture industry due to land application of various agricultural chemicals from pesticides to fertilizers , the decrease in VOCs in McLean County from almost 3 ,000 tons a year in 2000 - 2004 to approximately 800 tons per yea r in 2009 to under 500 tons in both 2016 and 2017 , is a significant decline. Champaign County showed a similar decline in VOCs and most closely mimics the economy of McLean County, in that agriculture is one of its primary sources of VOCs (Illinois Environ mental Protection Agency, Air Quality Reports by Year, Statewide Summary of Point Source Emissions, pp. decreases in VOCs may be in part related to the impact of evolving farming techniques, crop land set aside, bio -engineered seed that requires less pesticide application and reduced use of fertilizers. In addition, Central Illinois implementation of Environmental Protection Agency guidelines for more rigorous scrubber systems, air pollution control equipment that can remove particulates or gases from industrial exhaust/emissio ns, may have contributed to VOC reductions. In McLean County, an additional impact may be that the expansion of housing growth has pushed farmland further out and away from the McLean County air sampling testing site. Levels of NO and PM recorded in McLean County and Champaign County registered well below the level in Peoria County on a consistent basis. McLean County levels of CO and SO were noticeably lowest, to almost not detectible in the case of SO, in comparison to Peoria County and Champaign County. Water Drinking Water Violations The University of Wisconsin Center for Population Health's County Health Rankings notes that ensuring drinking water safety is important for prevent ing illness, nausea, diarrhea, skin irritation, birth defects, cancer, k idney, liver and nervous system damage, and even death. Water safety is a world -wide concern, with studies noting that an increase in water violations has been show n to increase healthcare costs (University of Wisconsin, Center for Population Health, Count y Health Rankings, Physical Environment, Drinking Water Violations, Indicator Description, 2022). Beginning in 2016, County Health Rankings report ed Drinking Water Violations with just two values: \"Yes\" and \"No\", where \"Yes\" means that at least one community water system (not including private wells) in the county received at least one health -based violation during a specified ti me frame. For McLean C ounty, a \"Yes\" has been receive d every year from 2016 - 2020. County Health Rankings acknowledges many li mitations to using this measure (University of Wisconsin, Center for Population Health, County Health Rankings, McLean County, Physical Environment, Dr inking Water Violations, 2022). Private and Non -Community Water Wells Private and non -community water wells are to be tested for Total Coliform/E -coli as an intervention to protect health. Water well samples acquired by the McLean County Health Departmen t are shipped to the Illinois Department of Public Health in Springfield for testing. Any results that are greater than 1 ppm/100 ml are in violation and a re -sample is needed. It is possible that one well on a property may have multiple violations because samples are taken until compliance is obtained. In 20 20, there were a total of 79 properties (parcels) that had private water wells sampled. Of these, 34 (43 percent) had a violation (McLean County Health Department, Environmental Health Division, 20 20). Lead in Water Lead in drinking water can cause serious health problems, particularly fo r children and pregnant women. The federal Safe Drinking Water Act (http://www.epa.gov/sdwa ) requires municipalities to test for lead and other contaminants in municipal water supplies. Lead in water is tested at each municipality's water treatment plant. The action level (concentration of a contaminant that triggers treatment or other required actions) fo r lead is 15 parts per billion ( ppb). Both the City of Bloomington and the Town of Normal publish annual water quality reports. The reports referencing water samples obtained in 20 20 indicate that both municipal water supplies were in compliance for lead l evels in 20 20 (City of Bloomington , Illinois , 2020 Annual Consumer Report on the Quality of Tap Water , 2020) ( Town of Normal , Illinois , Town of Normal Water Department , Annual Water Quality Report , 2021) . Fluoridation Fluoridation of community water sup plies is another way to protect and promote health. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention monitors the fluoride level of community water supplies. Fluoride is not required to be added to the community water supplies; however, if it is added, fluor ide levels must be maintained by the municipality that supplies the community water. Most water contains some fluoride, but it is usually n ot enough to prevent cavities. To protect the dental health of all citizens, community water supplies are required to adjust the fluoride level to between 0.9 - 1.2 milligrams per liter (415 Ill. Compiled Statute, Act 40/7a). In Illinois, the percent of people served by fluoridated community water systems has increased, from 95.2 percent in 1992 to 98. 2 percent in 201 8 (Fluoride Action Network, 2018). Of the 34 water systems in McLean County found in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention database, 30 (88 percent) had fluoridated water supplies (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Oral Health, My Water's Fluoride, 20 20). In 20 20, less than one percent ( 764 out of 170,954 residents) of McLean County residents on a community water supply receive water that does not meet the current standards for optimally fluoridated water (Centers for Disease Control and P revention, Oral Health, My Water's Fluoride, 20 20, U.S. Census 2020 ). McLean County exceeds the Healthy People 20 30 goal of \"increasing the proportion of people whose water systems have the recommended amount of fluoride to 77.1 percent\", with 99 percent o f its population receiving optimally fluoridated water. Radon Radon is a n invisible, odorless radioactive gas that is naturally released as radioactive metals break down in soil, rocks and groundwater. It can get into buildings through holes or even smal l cracks. Breathing in high levels of radon can eventually cause cancer. In the United States , it is the second leading cause of lung cancer after cigarette smoking (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Radon, February 2022). The Environmental Prote ction Agency estimates that radon causes over 21,000 lung cancer deaths per year, and that one in every 15 homes in the U.S. has high radon levels, which is a radon concentration above 4 picocuries per liter of air (pCI/L) (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Radon, February 2022). McLean County has been designated a Zone 1 county by the En vironmental Protection Agency. These Zone 1 counties have the highest potential for indoor radon screening levels greater than 4 pCi/L . Fifty -six counties out o f 102 in Illinois have been designated as Zone 1 (United States Environmental Protection Agency, 2018). Radon levels across McLean County are variable, ranging from a low of 0 to a high of 12.3 pCi/L . Measurements by ZIP code are available (Illinois Emerge ncy Management Agency /IEMA , Radon in Illinois, Interactive Map, 2019). In the City of Bloomington, half of homes tested for radon had levels above 4 pCi/L. No disparity was noted in radon testing level results between two ZIP codes for the City of Bloomin gton (61 701 and 61704). Both ZIP codes had an average radon test level of 5.3 pCi/L (Illinois Emergency Management Agency (IEMA) , Radon, 2014; retrieved 2022). In 2014 , (the most recent data posted on the IEMA webite as of April 2022) , the average indoor r adon level for homes in McLean County was 5. 5 pCi/L, higher than state ( 5.3 pCi/L) and national (1.3 pCi/L) levels. Half of McLean County homes tested for radon had levels above 4 pCi/L (Illinois Emergency Management Agency, Radon in Illinois, 2014). Exhibit 73 has a list of the nineteen municipalities in McLean County that had average radon levels above 4 pCi/L . Exhibit 73 : Municipalities with Radon Levels Above 4 pCi/L - McLean County, 2014 Radon Level in picocuries/Liter Municipalities 9.0 and above LeRoy (12.3) Source: Illinois Emergency Management Agency, Radon in Illinois, retrieved May 2022. Radon testing is not required to buy or sell a home in Illinois; however, both the Illinois Radon Awareness Act and the Illinois Real Property Disclosure Act requires home sellers to disclose their knowledge regarding the presence or absence of radon in the home (Illinois Emergency Management Agency, Radon Testing Guidelines for Real Estate Transactions, 2007) . Lead -based Paint There is no safe level of lead in the human body. Exposure to lead can pose serious health risks for children, including developmental delays, behavioral issues, learning disabilities and many other harmful health impacts (Illinois Department of Public Health, 2019 ). In Illinois, approximately 60 percent of the 4.9 million housing units were built prior to the le ad paint ban in 1978. Over half of owner -occupied and rental units in Bloomington (53 percent) were built before 1980, and therefore have the potential to present lead -based paint hazards. Roughly 33 percent of units built before 1980 in Bloomington house children. Renters in Bloomington are more likely to be exposed to lead -based paint hazards as 60 percent of rental units were built before 1980 compared to 49 percent of owner -occupied units (City of Bloomington Consolidated Plan, 2015 - 2019) (Illinois De partment of Public Health, Illinois Lead Program, Annual Surveillance Report, 2019) . Lead testing provides opportunities for lead surveillance and early intervention. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends monitoring children with bloo d lead levels of five micrograms per deciliter or higher; however, until January of 2019, the state of Illinois had set the monitoring level at 10 micrograms per deciliter or higher. It is now set at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention level due to Illinoi s Public Act 100 -0723 of 2019. Illinois law also requires physicians to perform a blood lead test on children six years of age or younger who liv e in a high -risk area for lead. In Illinois, approximately 40% of children reside in high -risk areas . Several other lead testing opportunities in Illinois are available that provid e additional lead surveillance: 1) Illinois laboratories are mandated to report adult lead test results of greater or equal to 10 micrograms per deciliter to the Adult Blood Lead Registry (ABLR); and, 2) an Illinois law requires schools built prior to January 1, 2000, to test the building's drinking water and submit the results to the Illinois Department of Public Health. (Illinois Department of Public Health, Illinois Lead Pr ogram, 2019). In 2019, of the over 236,000 children tested in Illinois, more than 7,000 had a blood lead level at the pub lic health intervention level. Of all children tested in Illinois in 2019, 69 percent were Medical Assistance (Medicaid) recipients; o f these, 2.7 percent had elevated blood lead levels, while 1.4 percent of non -Medicaid children h ad elevated blood lead levels. Of the McLean County children tested in 2019, a higher percentage of both Medicaid and non -Medicaid recipients had elevated bloo d lead levels compared to the state percentages . In McLean County, although the children being tested for lead were equally distributed between Medicaid recipients and non -Medicaid recipients, the children who were enrolled in Medicaid had a higher percent of elevated blood lead levels (EBL) than non -Medicaid recipients in McLean County. See Exhibit 74 . Exhibit 74 : Elevated Blood Lead Levels in Medicaid and Non -Medicaid Recipient Children \u2014McLean and Illinois, 2019 All Children Tested 2019 Percent Medicaid Enrolled Percent EBL >5 Percent EBL >10 Percent NON >5 Percent EBL >10 McLean 2,086 49.3 3.8 2.3 50.7 3.0 2.4 Illinois 236,465 68.7 2.7 2.1 31.3 1.4 1.0 EBL: Elevated Blood Lead level Source: Illinois Department of Public Health, Illinois Lead Program, 2019 Annual Surveillance Report, 2019.

Household H azardous Waste Household Hazardous Wastes (HHW) are materials and chemicals that are toxic, flammable, corrosive, reactive, or explosive. They typically cannot b e safely recycled or disposed of without a special center or collection event. These wastes can be a serious threat to water supplies and the local environment if they are improperly discarded with nonhazardous trash and put into a municipal solid waste la ndfill, dumped down the drain, or illegally dumped elsewhere. The Ecology Action Center in Normal, coordinates local collection events to meet the disposal need. In past years, the Ecology Action Center partnered with the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency (IEPA) to fund collection events. As state funding fluctuates, locally funded collections have been necessary. The most recent locally funded HHW Collection Events were in 2012, 2015, 2017, and 2019. The 2021 HHW Collection Event was primarily funde d by the IEPA. No industrial, commercial, or business wastes can be accepted at a residential Household Hazardous Waste Collection Event, only residential wastes. (Ecology Action Center, HHW_results_chart1998 -2021 incomplete, report by Executive Director M ichael Brown, 2021). Large amounts of HHW have been safely removed from McLean County since 1998. There have been 12 HHW collection events since 1998 that have removed a total of 207,318 gallons of HHW, or 3,770 fifty -five gallon drums. HHW collect ions have decreased each event since an all -time high collection in 2015; however, data has not yet been tabulated for the 2021 HHW collection event. (Ecology Action Center and Illinois Environmental Protection Agency, HHW_results_chart1998 -2021 incomplete, 2021 ). See Exhibits 75 and 76 for an illustration of this data.

Illinois Environmental Protection Agency, -disposal/household number of households choosing to \"carpool\" was observed from the most recent collection event in 2021 . This decreased the number of households represented per vehicle from 2.1 (2017) to 1.2 (2021). Another contribu ting factor to the drop in 2021 may be the COVID -19 pandemic which has encouraged social distancing and remote work and discouraged gatherings. Recommendations of carpooling as the COVID -19 pandemic ends could encourage non -driving populations to attend an d reduce waiting lines at the event (Ecology Action Center, HHW_results_chart1998 -2021 incomplete, 2021); (llinois Environmental Protection Agency, Household Hazardous 2006 2007 2012 2013 2015 2017 2019 2021Percent participating Year IEPA McLean County HHW fund Exhibit 77 : Number of Households Represented Per Vehicle Providing Household Hazardous Waste - McLean County Collection Events , 1998 - 2021 Sources: Ecology Action Center, HHW_results_chart1998 -2021 incomplete, Household Hazardous Wastes at https://ecologyactioncenter.org/hhw/ , 2021.

It is a progressive and irreversible disease that impairs memory and affects thinking and behavior, to the point of eventually interfering with daily tasks. The greatest risk factor currently known is increasing age. After age 65, the likelihood o f developing the disease doubles every five years; the risk is nearly 50 percent after age 85. Alzheimer's imposes heavy emotional and financial burden on families. While there is currently no cure, there are treatments that can slow the progression of A lzheimer's and improve the quality of life for people with Alzheimer's and their caregivers (Conduent Healthy Communit ies Institute, 2022 ).

This disease can have a harmful effect on most of the organ system s in the human body; it is a frequent cause of end -stage renal disease, non-traumatic lower -extremity amputation, and a leading cause of blindness among working age adults. Persons with diabetes are also at increased risk for ischemic heart disease, neurop athy, and stroke. According to the CDC, the direct medical expenditures attributable to diabetes are over $116 billion. Diabetes disproportionately affects minority populations and the elderly (Conduent Healthy Communities Institute, 2022) . Age-Adjusted E mergency Room and Hospitalization Rates A summary of t he age -adjusted em ergency room and hospitalization rates for numerous diabetes indicators is illustrated in Exhibit 88 below. All emergency room visit indicators are in the best 0 - 50th percentile range (green indicator) in comparison to other counties in Illinois . Age -adjusted hospitalizations due to diabetes, short -term complications of diabetes and Type 2 diabetes are in the worst 50th - 75th percentile range (yellow indicator) compar ed to other counties in Illinois (Conduent Healthy Communities, Illinois Hospital Association, 2018 - 2020 ).

Although the values for McLean County (shown above) for the various diabetes indicators are good in comparison to other counties in Illinois , there are statistically significant disparities by race/ethnicity, gender and age. The greatest disparities for diabetes for both emergency room visits and hospitalizations are seen in Black s or African Americans. Exhibit s 89 and 90 below illustrate disparities by race/ethnicity, age and/or gender when compared to the McLean County rate.

Death Rate: Diabetes The age-adjusted death rate due to diabetes in McLean County is 17.1 deaths per 100,000 population. This is in the best 0 - 50th percentile range (green indicator) compared to other counties in Illinois (Conduent Healthy Communities 23.1 19.2 18.547.2 38.9 38.6 05101520253035404550 Diabetes Type 2 Diabetes Uncontrolled DiabetesAge-adjusted ER VIsits McLean County Bloomington-61701 17.1 7.529.6 14.3 05101520253035 Diabetes Short-term Complications of DiabetesAge-adjustHed Hospitalizations McLean County Bloomington-61701 Institute, Centers for Dis ease Control and Prevention, 2018 - 2020 ). This is lower than the Illinois value (19.6 deaths per 100,000 population). The overall value for McLean County is decreasing over time, but not significantly. Disparities There are no disparities for gender. Additional disparity information is not available. Prevalence: Diabetes The percent of Medicare beneficiaries receiving treatment for diabetes in McLean County is 22.8 percent (Conduent Healthy Communities Institute, Centers for Medi care and Medicaid Services, 2018 ). This is in the best 0 - 50th percentile range (green indicator) compared to other counties in Illinois , is low er than the Illinois value (27.1 percent), higher than the prior value for McLean County (22.6 percent) and is trending favorably but not in a statistically significant direction. The percent of adults in McLean County ages 20 and over that have ever b een diagnosed with diabetes is 9 .1 percent. This is in the worst 25th percen tile range (red indicator) compared to other counties in Illinois . The rate is trending unfavorably but not in a statistically significant direction . The prior value is not statistically different from the current value for McLean County (Conduent Healthy Communities Institute, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2019) .

Disparities There are no disparities for gender. Additional disparity information is not available. According to the 2021 McLean County Community Health Survey, nine percent of survey respondents have diabetes (McLean County Community Health Survey, 2021). Data is not available from the 2018 survey. Infectious Disease Food Borne Illnesses and Other Pathogens E. Coli Escherichia coli (E. coli) are bacteria found in foods, the environment and in the intestines of people and animals. Most strains of E. coli are harmless, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC); however, other s can make individuals very sick, causing diarrhea, stomach cramps, vomiting, urinary tract infections, respiratory illnesses and pneumonia. Some strains, such as O157:H7, can cause a serious kidney condition called hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). (Cente rs for Disease Control and Prevention, https://www.cdc.gov/ecoli/index.html , April 2022). In Illinois, there are 100 - 200 cases of O157:H7 detected each year (Illinois Department of Public Health, https://dph.illinois.gov/topics - services/diseases -and-conditions/diseases -a-z-list/e -coli.html , May 2022). Nationally, children ages one to four year s had the highest incidence of E. coli infection of all age groups for both the O157 and non -O157 serogroups. The largest percentage of infections for both serogroups are reported in the summer months (Illinois Department of Public Health, https://dph.illinois.gov/topics -services/diseases -and-conditions/diseases - 2011 - 2017, McLean County case counts have rang ed from a low of 1 (2011 and 2017) to a high of 6 (2013). In 2016 , there were three cases of all E. coli serotypes. The Illinois (0.93) and national (0.71 /100,000 ) incidence rates are for the O157 serotype only ; both jurisdictions me t and exceed ed the Heal thy People 2030 goal of 3.7 cases per 100,000 (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Shiga toxin -producing Escherichia coli [STEC] Annual Survey, 2017; Illinois Department of Public Health , IQuery, 2016). Salmonella Salmonella are bacteria that can make people sick. Although there are over 2500 serotypes, less than 100 cause sickness in humans. Salmonella lives in the intestines of animals and people. Eating food, touching the feces or environment of animals, or drinking water contaminated with S almonella can lead to infection, causing diarrhea, fever, stomach cramps, nausea, vomiting and/or headache. Each year, there are an estimated 1,400,000 cases of salmonellosis in the United States and 1,500 - 2,000 cases of this foodborne illness in Illino is (Illinois Department of Public Health, Salmonella, 2022 ). In McLean County, case numbers for Salmonella fluctuate. Between 2010 and 2021, cases ranged from a low of 11 (2015) to a high of 67 (2012). The 2016 salmonella incidence rate for Illinois (11. 44 per 100,000 population) is lower than the national rate (14.51 per 100,000 population ) and the Healthy People 2030 goal of 11.5 cases per 100,000 (Illinois Department of Public Health, IQuery, 2022) (Illinois Department of Public Health, Office of Disea se Control, 2022) .

Tuberculosis Mycobacterium tuberculosis (\"TB\") is a bacteria that usually attacks the lungs, but can attack any part of the body. If not treated correctly, active TB can be fatal and can contribute to the development of drug -resista nt strains. TB spreads through the air from one person to the other through talking, coughing and singing. People can be infected with TB and not be sick and unable to spread the disease to others. This is called Latent TB Infection (LTBI). Without prophy lactic treatment, one in 10 people with LTBI will go on to develop active TB disease at some point in their lifetime. Although McLean County only identifies about one to two cases of active TB per year, there are many LTBI cases. In 2020, McLean County H ealth Department provided prophylactic treatment to 19 individuals with LTBI; in 2021, 33 people received prophylactic treatment for LTBI (Illinois Department of Public Health, Tuberculosis, 2022; McLean County Health Department Communicable Disease Progra m, Bloomington, IL, March 2022) . In McLean County, there were 0 cases of active tuberculosis in 2019, two in 2020, and one in 2021. In 2019, case rates per 100,000 were 0.00 in McLean County, 2.54 in Illinois, and 2.7 in the United States. In 2020, case r ates per 100,000 were 1.16 in McLean County, 1.69 for Illinois, and 2.2 for the United States. In 2021, case rates per 100,000 were 0.58 in McLean County, 2.00 for Illinois, and 2.37 for the United States. The National Tuberculosis Program Objectives and Performance target is no more than 1.3 cases per 100,000, the same target used by the Illinois Department of Public Health. For 2019, 2020, and 2021, McLean County met the national target (Illinois Department of Public Health, 2019, 2020, and 2021; McLean C ounty Health Department, Bloomington Illinois, 2019, 2020, and 2021).

Sexually Transmitted Infections Chlamydia Chlamydia , caused by Chlamydia trachomatus, is the most commonly reported bacterial sexually transmitted infection (STI) in the United States. It is easily treatable; but, if left untreated, it can cause permanent damage to a woman's reproductive system and make it difficult to get pregnant later (Illinois Department of Public He alth, Sexually Transmitted Diseases, Chlamydia, May 2022). In 2019, there were 661.7 cases of Chlamydia diagnosed per 100,000 population in McLean County. This rate is in the worst 25th percentile range (red indicator) compared to other counties in Illino is, is higher than the Illinois value (639.3 cases per 100,000 population) and the U.S. valu e (551 cases per 100,000); and is greater than the prior value previously measured at 554.9 cases per 100,000 population for McLean County. Th e rate is trending unf avorably in a statistically significant direction (Conduent Healthy Communities Institute, National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD and TB Prevention, 2016 ).

It is caused by a bacteria, Neisseria gonorrh oeae, that infects the mucous membranes of the reproductive tract, m outh, throat, eyes and rectum. It is treatable; however, if left untreated, it can cause pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) in women and epididymitis in men, both of which may lead to infer tility. (Illinois Department of Public Health, Sexually Transmitted Diseases, Gonorrhea, May 2022). McLean County's incidence rate for gonorrhea was 150.4 cases per 100,000 population in 2019. This rate is in the worst 50th - 75th percentile range (yellow indicator) compared to other counties in Illinois. It is lower than the state rate of 231.0 cases per 100 ,000 and higher than the prior value for McLean County (121.9 cases per 100,000).

Without early and adequate treatment, syph ilis can have serious health impacts. The infection usually follows a progression of four stages that can last for weeks to years: primary, secondary, latent and tertiary. \"Early syphilis\" is a term used for the primary, secondary and early latent stages. In 2019, there were 13.4 cases of primary and secondary syphilis per 100,000 population in McLean County, which is above the 2019 Illinois rate (10.8 cases per 100,000 population) and the United States rate of 11.9 cases per 100,000. The McLean County ra te is in the worst 25th percentile range (red indicator ) compared to other Illinois counties and the rate is higher than the prior value in 2018 (8.7 cases per 100,000 population) .

Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) The Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) is a virus that attacks the human immune system and interferes with the body's ability to fight infections. It can be transmitted through contact with infected blood, semen, or vagi nal fluids. Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) is a chronic condition that is caused by HIV. Medications can control the infection and prevent disease progression. From 2018 through May 2021, there has been a gradual decrease of HIV diagnosed in McLean County. In 2018, 17 newly diagnosed HIV cases and two newly diagnosed cases of AIDS were identified. In 2019, eight individuals were newly diagnosed with HIV and five cases of AIDS were diagnosed. In 2020, three newly diagnosed cases of HIV and two newly diagnosed cases of AIDS were identified. As of May 2021, one newly diagnosed case of HIV and zero cases of AIDS were identified. Lower numbers in 2020 - 2021 may be d ue to some clinics being closed or hours minimized, or clients skipping regu lar health checkups due to the COVID -19 pandemic. Exhibit 105 lists cases of HIV and AIDS from 2016 - 2021 in McLean County. Exhibit 105: Cases of HIV and AIDS - McLean County, 2016 - 2021 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 (through 5/31/21 ) HIV 8 16 17 8 3 1 AIDS 3 6 2 5 2 0 Source: Illinois Department of Public Health, HIV/AIDS Monthly Surveillance Update, 2016 - May 2021. In 2019, the Illinois Department of Public Health, the Chicago Department of Public Health and the AIDS Foundation of Chicago introduced a new five -year plan to end the HIV epidemic in Illinois by 2030 using the Getting to Zero Illinois (GTZ -IL) initiative. The plan include d strategies to reduce the number of new HIV infections to assist Illinois in reaching \"functional zero,\" the point at which the HIV epidemic cannot be sustained. As of 2022, educational efforts remain underway to increase awareness of key GTZ strategies: 1) to increase the number of p eople living with HIV who are taking medications to achieve viral suppression, when HIV cannot be transmitted sexually, a concept known as Undetectable = Untransmittable, or U=U; and, 2) to increase the use of PrEP (preexposure prophylaxis), a daily pill n early 100% effective at preventing HIV transmission, among persons vulnerable to HIV. Vaccine Preventable Diseases Pneumonia and Influenza Influenza (flu) is a contagious respiratory disease caused by the influenza virus. It can cause mild to severe il lness as well as pneumonia, which is an infection of the lungs. On average, about eight percent (range of three - 11 percent) of the U.S. population gets sick from influenza every year, and in 2018, approximately 1.5 million people were diagnosed with pneu monia in the emergency department an d more than 40,000 died from it (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Disease Burden of Flu, 2022). Thirty -three percent of McLean County adults have received a pneumonia vaccine at some point in their lifetime. This is in the worst 25th percentile range (red indicator) when compared to other counties in Illinois (Conduent Healthy Communities Institute, Illinois Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, 2015 - 2019). During the 2019 - 2020 flu season, there wer e an estimated 380,000 hospitalizations for flu and 20,000 deaths in the United States. The annual influenza vaccine can help prevent serious illness and death; however, only about half of the U.S. population ages six months and older gets vaccinated for f lu. During the 2020 - 2021 flu season, 52.1 percent of that population group were vaccinated. Nationally, flu vaccination coverage for adults has increased over the past three flu seasons (2018/2019; 2019/2020; 2020/2021) and, until the 2020/2021 flu seaso n, flu vaccination coverage for children had increased as well. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) continues to recommend that everyone ages six months and older get a flu vaccine every year (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Di sease Burden of Flu, 2022). According to the Illinois Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (2015 - 2019), 43.4 percent of McLean County adults received an influenza vaccination in the past 12 months. McLean County does not meet the Healthy People 2030 goal of 70 percent. When compared to other counties in Illinois, McLean County falls in the best 0 - 50 percentile range (green indicator) compared to other counties in Illinois for this measure, and its vaccination rate has been increasing since 2004 , from 29.5 percent to 43.4 percent (Conduent Healthy Communities Institute, Illinois Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, 2015 - 2019). See Exhibit 106. Exhibit 106: Adults with Influenza Vaccination - McLean County, 2004 - 2019 Source: Co nduent Healthy Communities Institute, Illinois Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, 2015 - 2019. The annual age -adjusted emergency room visit rate due to immunization -preventable pneumonia and influenza for 2018 -2020 was 14.9 visits per 10,000 po pulation ages 18 years or older (Conduent Health Communities Institute, Illinois Hospital Association, 2018 - 2020). When compared to other counties in Illinois, this measure falls in the best 0 - 50th percentile range (green indicator). McLean County's age-adjusted death rate due to influenza and pneumonia is 8.3 deaths per 100,000 population, which is in the best 0 - 50th percentile range (green indicator) when compared to other counties in Illinois (Conduent Healthy Communities Institute, Centers for D isease Control and Prevention, 2018 -2020). The rate is lower than the Illinois rate (15.1 deaths per 100,000 population), but not statistically different from the prior value for McLean County (8.6 deaths per 100,000 population). The rate is trending favor ably in a statistically significant direction. See Exhibit 107 below.

Other Vaccine Preventable Diseases Immunization Status for School -Age Children The immunization status of sch ool-age children in McLean County exceeds recommended Illinois Department of Public Health -specified levels necessary to prevent epidemics , according to immunization data collected from public and non - public schools for the 2020 - 2021 school year, the mos t current data published in 2022 (Illinois State Board of Education, Data Analysis and Accountability Division, Health Requirements/Student Health Data, School Year 2020 - 2021). Over 98 percent of students were fully protected or in compliance with vaccin ation requirements. The Healthy (MMR) vac cination (2 -doses for children by kindergarten) is 95 percent. McLean County has exceeded the national goal of completion of two doses of MMR . See Exhibit 109 below.

Measles \u2014Mumps \u2014Rubella (MMR) Measles (Rubeola) is a highly contagious viral illness that is spread thr ough the air via droplets when an infected individual coughs or sneezes. It can also be spread by direct contact if an individual touches a surface that has the virus on it and then touches their eyes, nose, or mouth. Symptoms of measles include a rash tha t starts on the face and neck, a mild to moderate to high fever, cough, runny nose and red, watery eyes (conjunctivitis). Measles can be dangerous, particularly for babies and young children. It is one of the most contagious diseases . If one person has mea sles, up to 90% of the people close to that person (if not immune) will become infected. Complications can be serious. One out of every 1,000 people with measles will develop brain swelling, which could lead to brain damage; and, one to three out of 1,000 people with measles will die, even with the best of care given to them (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Measles -Rubeola, 2022). In the United States in 2019, measles outbreaks were occurring in seven states (New York, Michigan, New Jersey, California, Georgia, Maryland and Pennsylvania) , primarily related to unvaccinated international travelers (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2019). Since measles was eliminated in the United States in 2000, the annual number of people reported with measles ranged from a low of 37 in 2004 to a high of 839 cases in 2019 (January 1 to May 10, 2019). The 2019 case count is the largest number of cases reported in the United States since 199 4. Measles cases in 2019 were confirmed in 23 states, including I llinois (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2019). As of May 5, 2022, there have been no cases of measles reported in McLean County in decades. The last documented case in McLean County was 1989 (Illinois Department of Public Health, May 2022). In Illinois, over the past 10 years, case numbers have ranged from zero to 17. See Exhibit 110 below for the Illinois case counts from 2010 - 2019.

It is spread from person to person by coughing and sneezing as well as through direct contact with the discharg es from the nose and throat of infected people. Mumps case counts in McLean County from 2013 - 2016 increased due to two mumps outbreaks in 2015 and 2016. Case counts were 0 in 2013 and 2014. During the 2015 outbreak, 71 cases were reported, and 88 percen t of cases were in persons ages 15 -24 years. During the 2016 outbreak, 41 cases were reported and 95 percent of cases were in persons ages 15 -24 years (McLean County Health Department, Bloomington, Illinois, 2018).

Rubella , also called German measles, is a viral illness that is spread from person to person by breathing in respiratory secretions or droplets that are exhaled from an infected person. Rubella was last reported in McLean County in 1990 (McLean County Health Department, Bloomington Illinois , 2022). Pertussis (Whooping Cough) Pertussis is caused by a bacteria called Bordetella pertussis, which lives in the nose, mouth and throat of individuals. It i s a highly contagious disease that can easily spread from person to person. Many pertussis cases are not diagnosed and therefore , not reported. Between 2012 and 2016, McLean County saw an increase in the number of pertussis cases (McLean County Health Department, Bloomington, I llinois, 2018). Updated data are no available as this data is no longer being tracked by the Illinois Department of Public Health's IQuery data system. See Exhibit 112 below for case numbers from 2012 - 2016.

Healthy People 2030 focuses on preventing infectious diseases by increasing vaccination rates. In both 2015 and 2016, most cases identified in McLean County occurred in children between the ages of 10 to 19 years , 47 percent of cases i n 2015 and 54 percent in 2016. For comparison, from 2010 - 2014 , 19 percen t of cases occurred in children under the age of one and 27 percent occurred in individuals 11 to 18 years of age. During this period, pertussis cases in McLean County and Illinois declined 33 percent and 38 percent, respectively (Illinois Department of Pu blic Health, IQuery, 2010 - 2014). In 2016, there were 11 cases of pertussis in McLean County. All cases occurred in individuals aged 19 and under. (Illinois Department of Public Health, IQuery, 2016). For a 12 -year trend, see Exhibit 113 below for the Il linois and McLean County case counts.

Varicella (Chickenpox) Varicella, commonly called chickenpox, is a highly contagious disease caused by the virus, varicella zoster. When one person has chickenpox, up to 90 percent of the individuals close to that person, who are not immune to the disease, will also become infec ted. It is spread person to person by direct contact with secretions from respiratory tracts, direct contact with fluid from the chickenpox blisters, and by handling an infected person's bedding or clothing. Chickenpox can be a serious disease and even lif e-threatening, especially for infants, pregnant women, and people with weakened immune systems (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Chickenpox -Varicella, 2022). Once an individual has had chickenpox, then shingles can also occur. The risk for shing les increases as a person ages (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Shingles \u2014Herpes Zoster, 2022). Data on the number of varicella outbreaks that occur each year in the U nited States is lacking due to variations in reporting requirements. In the U nited States, a vaccine was licensed for use in March 1995. Since its introduction, the number of outbreaks ha s decreased, de monstrated through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Varicella Active Surveillance Project (VASP) that was active fr om 1995 - 2010 . Due to implementation of the two -dose varicella vaccine, sites participating in VASP saw a 90 percent decrease in varicella cases from 1995 - 2008 . Among infants , varicella disease decreased 90 percent (1995 - 2008) and 74 percent among adults (1995 - 2005) (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Varicella Active Surveillance Project). Prior to vaccine availability, about 4 million people got chickenpox every year in the U.S., with over 10,500 hospitalized and about 100 - 150 deaths. Healthy People 2030 focuses on preventing infectious diseases by increasing vaccination rates. (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Chickenpox -Varicella, 2022). In Illinois, varicella remains a reportable disease. Case reports dropped 90% from 20 09 (40 cases reported) to 2021 (4 cases reported) in McLean County (Illinois Department of Public Health, IQuery, 2009 - 2016) (Illinois Department of Public Health, Office of Disease Control - INEDSS, 2017 - 2021) .

It can be spread by breathing in droplets and particles in the air that contain the virus when close to an infected person who is exhaling (e.g., talking, singing, coughing), or when the droplets or particles come into contact with a person's mouth, nose or eyes; or, when an individual to uches their own mouth, nose or eyes with hands that have the virus on them. Symptoms range from none, to mild, to very severe. Post - COVID -19 conditions have also been identified and can be long -lasting. Even individuals who only experienced mild symptoms m ay experience post -COVID -19 conditions. In 2020, COVID -19 was declared a pandemic and that status was continued in 2021 and 2022. Vaccines, testing and treatments became more readily available in 2021; however, by May of 2022, the nation approached a miles tone of one million deaths from COVID -19, and over 82 million cases documented (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, COVID -19, Frequently Asked Questions, May 2022; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, COVID -19 Data Tracker, May 2022). McLean County experienced its first reported case of COVID -19 on March 19, 2020. The McLean County Health Department and the Illinois Department of Public Health tracked the number of COVID -19 cases reported each week. By May 13, 2022, the total number of probable and confirmed cases of COVID -19 reported in McLean County since March of 2020 was 52,241. Exhibit 115 reflects the number of COVID -19 cases reported by week in McLean County in both 2020 and 2021.

As of May 6, 2022, McLean County had an incidence rate of 48.14 cases per 100,000 population. This rate is in the worst 25th percentile range (red indicator) compared to other counties in Illinois and is higher than the both the Illinois and U.S. values. The value is increasing and in a statistically significant direct ion. See Exhibit 116.

Two COVID -19 vaccines (Pfizer and Moderna) became available in late December 20 20 under Federal Drug Administration (FDA) Emergency Use Authorizations. Vaccine campaigns for eligible individuals began in earnest in January 2021. By December 31, 2021, the McLean County Health Department, along with community partners, had sponsored 171 mass vaccination clinics: 113 at the Grossinger Motors Arena, 12 at Illinois State University, 14 through community events, and 32 coordinated thro ugh community groups, including those in rural communities. Many additional venues were available to receive vaccines throughout 2021 - 2022, including pharmacies, primary care offices, the McLean County Health Department Immunization Clinic, student healt h services, and the offices of pediatricians. See Exhibit 117 for the number of doses of vaccine administered per week in 2021 through McLean County Health Department mass vaccination clinics.

The COVID -19 pandemic has impacted all communities, although a disproportionate burden can be seen among some racial and ethnic gr oups at the local, state and national level. As of mid -May 2022, the Illinois Department of Public Health documented, for McLean County, on its website a cumulative (March 2020 - mid-May 2022) total of 52,655 cases of COVID -19 and 294 confirmed deaths. The McLean County Health Department tracks both confirmed deaths from COVID -19 (79.57 percent of the total number of COVID -19 deaths) as well as \"probable\" COVID -19 deaths (20.43 percent of the total), with a cumulative total (March 2020 - mid-May 2022) of 36 4 confirmed and probable deaths due to COVID -19. The Non -Hispanic Black population experienced a higher percentage of cases of COVID -19 compared to the percent this population represents in the county population; however, the percent of deaths among Non -Hispanic Black residents was not disproportionate (Illinois Department of Public Health, COVID -19 Statistics, May 2022).

Disparities In McLean County: COVID -19 vaccination rates for all race and ethnic groups, except Asian residents, trail Non -Hispanic White resident vaccination rates. the percentage of COVID -19 cases for Non -Hispanic Black, Hispanic, and American Indian/Alaskan Native residents is disproportionate to the percent of the McLean County population represented by their race or ethnicity. Mental Health Mental illnesses are one of the leading causes of disability in the United States. In any given year, approximately 13 million American adults have a seriously debilitating mental illness. Unstable mental health can lead to suicide, which accounts for the death of approximately 30,000 Americans every year ( Conduent Healthy Communities Institute , 2022 ). Additionally, o ne in five Americans will experience a mental illness in a given year, o ne in five children, either currently or at some point during their life, have had a seriously debilitating mental illness and o ne in 25 Americans lives with a serious mental illness, such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or major depre ssion (Centers for Disease C ontrol and Prevention, Mental Health. November 22, 2021. Mental Health Index Mental health is known to be strongly correlated with financial stability, access to health care services, and social environment. The Mental Health Index considers valid ated indicators related to access to care, physical health status, transportation, employment, and household environment to identify areas at highest risk for experien cing poor mental health. All ZIP codes, census tracts, and counties in the United States are given an index value from 0 (low need) to 100 (high need). Communitieswith the highest values are estimated to have the highest socioeconomic and health needs correlated with self -reported poor mental health. Ranks and colors help to identify the rela tive level of need within a community or service area. The national index value for each location is compared to all other similar locations within the community area to assign a relative rank (from 1 to 5) locally. These ranks are used to color the map and chart for the Mental Health Index, with darker coloring associated with higher relative need (Conduent Healthy Communities Institute, 2021). See Exhibit 121 below for McLean County's Mental Health Index. Exhibit 121 : Mental Health I ndex - McLean County , 2021 Source: Conduent Healthy Communities Institute, 2021.

ICD-9 and I CD-10 Hospital Data Psychiatric visits were the second most common reason for patient visits to Carle BroMenn Medical Center 's emergency room from 2012 to 2020 . In 2020, it was the first most common reason for adult Medicaid patients visiting the emerg ency room and the second most common reason for children with Medicaid (Carle BroMenn Medical Center , ICD - 9 and ICD-10 Diagnosis . 2012 - 2020 ). Psychiatric visits were the fifth most common reason for patient visits to OSF St. Joseph Medical Center's emerg ency room (OSF St. Joseph Medical Center, ICD -10 Diagnosis, 2021) . Oral Health Oral health has an impact on overall health. The negative impacts of poor dental health go well beyond having missing or hurting teeth. They also affect academics, employment and well -being. 0%5%10%15%20%25%30%35%34% 29% 27% 10%Counselor Family/Friend Doctor/nurse Other Health Impact Poor oral health can ha ve long -term effects that are associated with serious illnesses like cardiovascular disease, certain cancers, pneumonia and dementias as well as birth complications (University of Illin ois-Chicago, College of Dentistry, 2019). According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, nearly one -third of adults in the United States have untreated tooth decay or tooth caries. One in seven adults aged 35 - 44 years old has periodontal di sease. Periodontal disease and tooth decay are the most frequent causes of tooth loss. Missing teeth can affect overall health and nutrition (Conduent Healthy Communities, 2022). Additionally, the average cost of a Medicaid enrollee's inpatient hospital treatment for dental problems is nearly 10 times more expensive than the cost of preventive care delivered in a dentist's office. From 2008 - 2011, a Pew Research Center study noted that there were approximately 77,000 dental visits to hosp itals in the Chic ago Metro area (American Public Health Association, American Journal of Public Health, Impact of Poor Oral Health o n Children's School Atte ndance and Performance, 2011). Academic Impact When children miss school due to illness, parents may miss work as well to stay home with them. A study published in 2011 noted that children with poor oral health were more likely to: 1) have pain; 2) miss school; and 3) demonstrate poor academic performance (The Pew Research Center on the States, A Costly Dental Destina tion: Hospital Care Means States Pay Dearly, 2012) (American Public Health Association, American Journal of Public Healt h, Impact of Poor Oral Health on Children's School Atte ndance and Performance, 2011). Nearly two in five (38 percent) of Illinois parent s say their children between the ages of six and 12 had to miss school due to an oral health problem in the past 12 months (Delta Dental of Illinois, Children's Oral Health Report: An Exam of the Oral Health of Illinois Children, 2018). Employment Impact Having an imperfect smile may prevent a manager from hiring that person for certain roles. A 2008 study, \"Social Perceptions of Individuals Missing Upper Front Teeth\", referenced in a University of Illinois College of Dentistry online article, \"The Many Costs (Financial and Well -Being) of Poor Oral Health \", noted that people missing front teeth were viewed as less intelligent and less trustworthy than someone with a healthy smile . Perceptions such as this may result in periods of unemployment due to the a ppearance of a person's smile. Some individuals may not apply for a job because of their oral health. About 35 percent of low -income adults feel embarrassed over the condition of their teeth. Twenty -nine percent of low -income adults and 28 percent of youn g adults feel like the appearance of their mouth and teeth affect their ability to interview for a job (University of Illinois - Chicago, College of Dentistry, 2019 , The Many Costs (Financial and Well -Being) of Poor Oral Health, August 6, 2019 ). Well -being Impact A person's well -being and social activities may be imp acted due to poor oral health. An American Dental Association report noted that people feel life is less satisfying when the health of their m outh and teeth is not optimal. It also noted that one in five adults experience anxiety and 23 percent feel embarrassment due to poor oral healt h. Some individuals avoid smiling (one in four adults) and 22 percent of young adults avoid social activities because of the current condition of their teeth (A merican Dental Association, ADA Health Policy Institute Report: Oral Health and Well -Being in the United States, 2015). Age-Adjusted Emergency Room Rate due to Dental Problems The age -adjusted emergency room rate due to dental problems for McLean County is 32.6 emergency room visits per 10,000 population (Conduent Healthy Communities Institute, Illinois Hospital Association, 2018 - 2020).

School -Aged Children and Oral Health Data Compliance with Oral Health Exams The Illinois State Board of Education (ISBE) maintains annual oral health exam compliance rates. As of 2022, the most recent data published and accessible by county was for the 2013 -2014 school year. Results for all schools in Illinois is available throu gh the 2020 - 2021 school year. Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests may be used to obtain county -specific data. Percentage of Children with Untreated Dental Caries Comparing 2020 - 2021 data, obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request, with the 2013 -2014 data published on the Illinois State Board of Education website, there has been an improvement in the percentage of sixth - grade children with untreated dental caries, from 10.5 percent (2013 -2014) down to 7.14 percent. Kindergarten children experienced an increase in untreated dental caries when comparing 2013 -2014 to 2020 -2021. None of the three grade levels met the Healthy P eople 2030 target of 10.2 percent (Illinois State Board of Education, 2013 -2014 and 2020 -2021). See Exhibit 137 below.

Non -Hispanic Asian children had the highest rate of untreated dental caries (28.8 percent) follow ed by Non - Hispanic Black children (26.7 percent). Eligibility for the Free and Reduced -Price Meal Program (FRMP) is a factor in disease burden: children who were eligible for the program had more caries experience (48.9 percent compared to 32 percent), more untreated caries (26.7 percent compared to 15.6 percent) and lower prevalence of dental sealants (51.2 percent compared to 56.8 percent) than children who were not eligible for the program. Respiratory Disease Chronic lower respiratory disease (CLR D) refers to a diverse group of disorders characterized by airway obstruction, causing shortness of breath and impaired lung function and includes asthma, emphysema, bronchitis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Chronic lower respiratory disease is a leading cause of death and generally occurs in older adults. While mortality rates of other leading causes of death have decreased, deaths due to chronic obstructive respiratory diseases have continued to rise . Smoking cigarettes , as well as exposure to secondhand smoke , and chemical irritants are important risk factors. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, over 30 billion dollars are spent annually on chronic ob structive respiratory diseases (Conduent Healthy Communities Institut e, 2022). Age-Adjusted Emergency Room and Hospitalization Rates A summary of t he age -adjusted emergency room and hospitalization rates for numerous respiratory indicators are illustrated in Exhibit 138 below.

The 2022 report card contains data for 2020 and indicates 38.9 percent of births in Illinois were to women covere d by Medicaid insurance and the percentage of births in 2020 to women with Medicaid (38.9 percent) was lower compared to 2017 (40.0 percent). See Exhibit 154 . Exhibit 154 : Medicaid Coverage of Births \u2014Illinois, 2017 - 2020 2017 2018 2019 2020 Mothers with Medicaid insurance at the time of a live birth 40.9% 39.1% 38.2% 38.9% Source: March of Dimes Foundation, Data for Illinois, Report Cards (2017 - 2020), 2022. In 2022, the most recent data published for McLean County women enrolled in the federal Women Infants Children (WIC) Supplemental Nutrition Program, is for 2015, when 659 women participated in WIC and there were 2,128 live births in the county. Women in WIC are Medicaid eligible and births to these women would be a subset of all Medi caid births. For the most recent available data, IQuery reports that in 2019 in McLean County, there were 463 infants born to WIC program participants, which is 26.2 percent of the 1,769 live births in McLean County that year. This is comparable to the Ill inois rate of 26.8 percent. The McLean County rate has been decreasing from a high of 30 percent in 2017 (Illinois Department of Public Health, IQuery, 2019). As of 2021, the number of McLean County infants and children enrolled in Medicaid increased from 13,374 (2017) to 13,934 (2021); however, this is a decrease from the high of 14,243 in 2014. In Illinois, after experiencing decreases in enrollment from 2013 - 2019, the numbers are now tr ending upwards in 2020 and 2021 (The Annie E. Casey Foundation Kids Count Data Center, Children Enrolled in Medical Assistance Programs by County, McLean, Fiscal Year 2012 - Fiscal Year 2021). Mothers Who Drank Alcohol Before, During or After Pregnancy From 2010 - 2019 in McLean County, the age -adjusted rate for babie s born to mothers who reported drinking alcohol during pregnancy ranged from a rate that was so small that a rate could not be calculated to a high of 14.8 per 100,000 (2013), with a case count of 27 live births that year to mothers who drank alcohol durin g pregnancy. The most recent data, in 2019 for McLean County, was 5.8 per 100,000, with a case count of 12 live births. This rate is higher than the 2019 Illinois rate of 5.2 per 100,000 (Illinois Department of Public Health, IQuery, 2010 - 2019). The 201 9 Illinois Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring (PRAMS) anonymous survey was sent to 2,099 Illinois mothers who had delivered a live infant; 1,235 responded. Of those completing the survey, 64.3 percent reported consuming alcoholic beverages during the thr ee months before pregnancy . This is an increase from the 2009 PRAMS survey that reported 53 percent drank alcoholic beverages on a weekly basis during the three months prior to pregnancy and from the 2016 PRAMS survey that reported 59.9 percent consumed al coholic drinks during the three months before pregnancy. Additionally, PRAMS data indicates that Illinois has not met the Healthy People 2030 target to increase the percent of pregnant females ages 15 to 44 years who report abstaining from alcohol in the past 30 days to 92.2 percent (Illinois Department of Public Health, Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System [PRAMS] 2009, 2016, 2019). Mothers Who Smoked During Pregnancy As of 2021, the most recent data available from the Illinois Vital Records System was from 2011 - 2016 for McLean County, which indicated t he percentage of births that were to mothers that smoked and/or used tobacco products during pregnancy in McLean County ranged from 11.4 percent (2012) for 247 births, to a high of 13.7 percen t (2015) for 292 births. The most current available rate is for 2016, with 12.7 percent of births to county women who reported smoking during pregnancy, leaving 87.3 percent of births to county women who did not smoke during pregnancy. Every year, 2011 - 2016, the Mc Lean County rate was higher than the Illinois rate (a low of 5.0 percent in 2019 to a high of 10.7 percent in 2016). Rates for Illinois were available through 2019. The Illinois rate dropped further in 2017 - 2019, from a high of 10.7 percent ( 2016) to a low of 5 percent in 2019. McLean County, with a rate of 87.3 percent, did not meet the Healthy People 2030 goal of having 95.7 percent of pregnant women repor t not smoking during pregnancy (Illinois Department of Public Health, Vital Statistics: 2011 - 2016, 2021). Mothers Who Use Other Substances During Pregnancy Infants who are born and thought to have been exposed to illegal substances, through observation by physicians or by toxicology test results, are reported to the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services (DCFS). These cases are investigated by DCFS to verify the infant's prenatal exposure. This information is not available at the county level. The most recent state -level data available in 2018 is from 2013, identifying 447 s ubstance exposed infants (0.29 percent) out of the 155,528 live births in Illinois. This is the second lowest rate in the six -year period of 2008 -2013 (Illinois Department of Children and Family Services, Abuse and Neglect Statistics, Substance Exposed Inf ants, November 2015). Maternal Age Data from 20 09 to 201 9 indicates that the percent of mothers ages 35 and over has continued to rise since 2009 for both McLean County and Illinois. The percent of live births to McLean County women in this age category has moved from a low of 10.6 percent (2012) with 229 live births to a high of 16.8 percent (2019) with 298 live births. The McLean County percentage has remained lower each year than the Illinois rates, which increased each year 2009 - 2019 (ranging fro m 15.6 percent to 20.8 percent) (Illinois Department of Public Health, Vital Statistics, 2009 - 2019). Maternal Mortality Maternal mortality is measured in two ways: 1) Pregnancy -Associated Deaths: the death of a woman while pregnant or within one year of pregnancy from any cause; and, 2) Pregnancy -Related Deaths: the death of a woman while pregnant or within one year of pregnancy from a cause related to the pregnancy. From 2008 - 2017 in Illinois, a cumulative total of 754 women died while pregnant or within one year of pregnancy. In April 2021, the Illinois Department of Public Health published the Maternal Mortality Report 2016 - 2017, which included the findings from two Maternal Mortality Review Committees that reviewed 129 maternal deaths that occurred during 2016 - 2017 in Illinois. The report note d that an average of 75 women die each year while pregnant or within one year of pregnancy; this is one death every five days. About one in three pregnancy -associated deaths were pregnancy -related deaths. The timing of these pregnancy -related deaths includ e: one in three women died while pregnant one in three women died during the first two months postpartum one in three women died two or more months postpartum . More than four out of five pregnancy -related deaths in Illinois are preventable. Some significa nt disparities exit. Non - Hispanic Black women in Illinois are about three times as likely to die from a pregnancy -related condition as Non - Hispanic White women, and more likely to die from pregnancy -related medical conditions. Non -Hispanic White women were more likely to die from pregnancy -related mental health conditions. Women on Medicaid during pregnancy were three times as likely to die within one year of pregnancy as women with private insurance (Illinois Department of Public Health, Maternal Morbidi ty and Mortality, 2016 - 2017). Separate county -level statistics were not provided in the April 2021 report. During 2016 - 2017 in Illinois, there were 175 pregnancy -associated deaths. Common underlying causes for pregnancy - associated deaths in that time period included: medical causes (46 percent), suicide (eight percent), homicide (13 percent), drug overdose (22 percent), and other injuries (12 percent) (Illinois Department of Public Health, Maternal Morbidity and Mortality, 2016 - 2017). Disparities Maternal mortality in Illinois: A Non -Hispanic Black woman is three times more likely to die from a pregnancy -related condition than a non - Hispanic White woman . A Non -Hispanic Black woman is more likely to die from pregnancy -related medical conditions than a Non - Hispanic White woman . A Non -Hispanic White woman is more likely to die from pregnancy -related mental health conditions . Women on Medicaid during pregnancy were three times as likely to die within one year of pregnancy as women with private insurance . Other Maternal Indicators The Public Health Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) anonymous survey is a surveillance instrument used by the Illinois Department of Public Health as part of a national initiative by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to reduce morbidity and mortality. The 2019 PRAMS survey was sent to 2,099 recent mothers in Illinois, and 1,235 survey responses were received. A comparison of the 2009 and 2019 Illinois Department of Public Health PRAMS re sults revealed gains in pre -conception health . This includes a reduction in smoking during the last three months of pregnancy , an improvement in the percent of postpartum women who breastfed at least once , and an increase in the percent of women who placed infants on their backs most of the time. There were also increases in the rate of individuals being diagnosed with depression either during their pregnancy or after the pregnancy. The survey results are unable to project if this increase is due to improve d depression screening on the part of healthcare providers or if it is due to increases in the occurrence of depression ( Illinois Department of Public Health , Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System [PRAMS ] 2009 , 2016 , 2019).

Breastfeeding The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends infants be exclusively breastfed for the first six months of life, with continued breastfeeding while introducing new foods for at least one year. Nationally, 8 4.1 percent of all infants born in the United Sta tes in 201 7 started to breastfeed, with 5 8.3 percent still breastfeeding at six months of age and 35. 3 percent breastfeeding at 12 months (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Breastfeeding Report Card : United States 2020 ). The state -level statisti cs for Illinois show a similar pattern of decline in breastfeeding throughout the first year of life. A higher percentage of breastfed infants in Illinois (26.2 percent) were also given formula before two days of age compared to the United States rate (19 .2 percent).

Partial breastfeeding rates ranged from 16.7 percent to 18.6 percent for quarters one through three (July 2021 - March 2022). Total percent breastfeeding in fis cal year 2022 was 27.4 percent in first quarter , 28.2 percent in second quarter , and 28.0 percent in third quarter . This is slightly below the state average of 31.56 percent (McLean County Health Department, WIC Program, 2022). The McLean County Milk Bank , housed at the McLean County Health Department, has received 28,448 ounces of donated breast milk since the grand opening on February 14, 2017. The donated milk is shipped to the Mother's Milk Bank of the Western Great Lakes where it is proce ssed and dis tributed . In Illinois, through legislative efforts in 2019, donor milk can be obtained through insurance when the client has a medical need (specific medical conditions) (McLean County Health Department, WIC Program, 2022). Live Births In 2019, there were 1,769 live births in McLean County. In the eleven -year period of 2009 - 2019, the number of live births in McLean County ranged from a low of 1,769 (2017) to a high of 2,169 (2012). There has been a decrease of 17 percent in the number of live births in McLean County when comparing 2009 to 2019 . Births in 2019 were down 18.4 percent from the peak in 2012 (2,169 live births) . Illinois experienced an 18 percent decrease in live births from 2009 to 2019 .

The general fertility rate in the United States in 2019 was 58.3 births per 1,000 women (ages 15 - 44), a decline of one percent from 2018 (59.1) and a record low rate for the United States. It was also the fifth year in a row for a de cline (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Vital Records Report, Births: Final Data 2019, 2020). In 2015, the state of Illinois began reporting race and ethnicity (Non -Hispanic White; Non -Hispanic Black; Non -Hispanic Other; Hispanic) fo r live births. Prior to 2015, all women giving birth and reporting Hispanic ethnicity were included in the White race category. In 2019, the most recent year with available data, 72.8.3 percent (1,287) of live births in McLean County were non -Hispanic Whit e; 12.6 percent (223) non -Hispanic Black , which was a decrease of one percent from 2018; 8.1 percent (143) non -Hispanic other ; and 6.6 percent (116) were Hispanic , which was an increase of one percent from 2016 (Illinois Department of Public Health, Vital Statistics \u2014Births, 2009 - 2019 ). Exhibit 158 presents the percent of McLean County live births by race and ethnicity from 2009 - 2019.

For 2009 - 2014, the percent for Hispanic is the percent of all live births who were of Hispanic origin. Beginning in 2015 , the state starte d categorizing \"race and ethnicity,'' rather than listing them separately. For 2015 - 2019, four categories were used: Non - Hispanic White, Non -Hispanic Black, Non -Hispanic Other and Hispanic. All four of these categories now add up to the total of all live births. Note: the percent of Hispanic origin live births compares across all years, 2009 through 201 9, as it is, in both cases, the percent of all live births. Source: Illinois Department of Public Health, Vital Statistics, Births, 2009 - 2019. 2017, when Hispanic births moved into the six percent range, births by race and ethnicity do not consistently align with the proportion of that race or ethnicity in the population. According to the 2020 U.S. Census estimates, the McLean County population consists of: Non -Hispanic White: 79.2 percent (births Non -Hispanic White) Non -Hispanic Black: 8 .4 percent (births in 2019: 12.6 percent Non -Hispanic Black) Hispanic: 5.2 percent (births in 2019: 6.6 Indian/Alaskan Native: 0.3% Births by Cesarean Section In the eleven -year period (2009 - 2019), the rate of cesarean sections performed during labor and delivery in McLean County has been consistently higher than both the Illinois and national rates. In 2019, 35 percent (619) of live births resulted f rom cesarean sections. The annual rate ranged from a low of 33.1 percent (677) in 2009, to a high of 39.4 percent (824) in 2011. The Healthy People 2030 target is to have no more than 23.9 percent of live births by cesarean section. In 2019, McLean County continued to exceed both the state (29.6 percent) and national (31.7 percent) rate as well as the Healthy People 2030 goal (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Health Statistics, 2019; Illinois Department of Public Health, Vital Statistics, Birth Characteristics, 2019). Births to Adolescent Mothers In McLean County, the number and percent of births to adolescent mothers (individuals under age 20) has continued to steadily decrease over the past thirteen years, falling 62.5 perc ent from 2007 to 2019 (Illinois Department of Public Health, Vital Statistics). Using data from 2014 - 2020, the County Health Rankings reported in 2022 that McLean County's teen birth rate (the number of births per 1,000 females ages 15 - 19) was 10, whic h is lower than the Illinois rate of 14.6 in 2019 and 13.6 in 2020, and the national rate of 16.7 in 2019. Although teen pregnancy and birth rates have gone down, disparities by race and ethnicity remain. In McLean County, the rate for Black or African A merican teens is 30 and Hispanic or Latino teens is 18, compared to White teens at seven . The Healthy People 2030 target is 31.4 pregnancies per 1,000 females (University of Wisconsin, Center for Population Health, County Health Rankings, 2022). See Exhi bit 159 for additional trend data.

Birth Outcomes Infant Mortality An infant dying before age one is considered an infant death. Infant mortality rates are one indicator of the overall health of a community. Nationally, neonatal mortality (deaths occurring during days 0 - 27) is associated with gestational age, low birth weight and congenital malformations, or the development of other health problems before or after birth. Post -neonatal mortality (deaths occurring after birth during days 28 - 364) is associated with Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), unintentional injury and congenital malformations (Illinois Department of Public Health, Infant Mortality webpage, 2018). In Illinois, in 2020, the top ten leading causes of infant death were disorders related to short gestation and low birth weight; congenital malformations, deformations and chromosomal abnormalities; newborn affected by maternal complications of pregnancy; accidents; newborn affected by complications of placenta, cord and membranes; bacterial sepsis of the newborn; sudden infant death syndrome; assault (homi birth asph yxia; and, neonatal hemorrhage (Illinois Department of Public Health, Infant Mortality Statistics, 2010 - 2020). No data was available on the Illinois Department of Public Health website regarding the leading cause s of infant mortality for McLean County. The most recent available infant mortality rate for McLean County is 6.4 deaths per 1,000 live births. This is in the worst 50th - 75th percentile range (yellow indicator) compared to other counties in Illinois, is higher than the Illinois value of 6.1 deaths per 1,000 live births and the prior value of 6.0. The number of deaths is trending favorably, but not in a statistically significant direction and the rate does not meet the Healthy People 2020 target of 6.0 deaths per 1,000 live births nor the Healthy People 2030 target of 5.0 deaths per 1,000 live births. Disparities are apparent in the Illinois rates , with the Non -Hispanic White rate (4.4) exceeding the Healthy People 2030 target (5.0), and the Non -Hispani c Black rate (11.4) more than double the rate for Non -Hispanic White (Conduent Healthy Communities Institute, Illinois Department of Public Health, 2017 -2019). See Exhibit 160 below. Exhibit 160 : Infant Mortality Rate - McLean County, 2016 - 2018 McLean County 6.4 Deaths/1,000 live births The Illinois Department of Public Health reports McLean County infant mortality rates have ranged from a low of 5.7 deaths per 1,000 live births (2010) to a high of 10.5 (2011), with the n umber of deaths ranging from 8 - 22. State infant mortality rates show far less variation, ranging from a low of 6.0 deaths per 1,000 live births (2013, 2015) to 6.8 (2010). In 2019, the Illinois infant mortality rate dropped to 5.5 per 1,000, the first t ime the rate had dropped below 6.0 in the ten-year period 2010 - 2019 (Illinois Department of Public Health, Infant Mortality Statistics, 2010 - 2019).

In 2018, out of 50 states, Illinois ranked 36 in infant mortality. Risk factors and risk markers for infant mortality in Illinoi s include: infants born to women l ess than 20 years old; infants born to Black women; infant mortality rate decreased as the mother's education level increased; infant mortality was highest among women covered by Medicaid compared to women who had private insurance or other payment plans; and, infant mortality was higher among infants born to women with preexisting chronic conditions (Illinois Department of Public Health, Office of Women's Health and Family Services, Illinois Infant Mortality Data Report, December 2020). Disparities In Illinois in 2018 - 2019: The infant mortality rate varied by race and ethnicity: Non -Hispanic White: 4.4 Non -Hispanic Black: 11.4. The infant mortality rate for infants born to Non -Hispanic Black women decreased as the mother's education level increased. Hispanic: 5.3 Other: 3.0 The infant mortality rate was highest among women covered by Medicaid. Low Birth Weight (<2,500 grams; less than 5 pounds, 8 ounces) In McLean County, 8.8 percent of infants are considered to have low birth weight, which is in the worst 50th - 75th percentile range (yellow indicator) compared to other counties in Illinois and is higher than the Illinois value of 8. 4 percent and the U.S. value of 8.3 percent . The current value is also higher than the prior value in 2018 of 7.3 percent and exceeds the Healthy People 2020 target of 7.8 percent. There is not a comparable target in the Healthy People 2030 measures. The rate is trending unfavorably, but not in a statistically significant direction (Conduent Healthy Communities Institute, Illinois Department of Public Health, 201 9). See Exhibit 162 below. Exhibit 162 : Babies with Low Birth Weight - McLean County, 2007 - 2019 McLean County 8.8% Source: Conduent Healthy Communities Institute, Illinois Department of Public Health, 201 9. The low birth weight rate in McLean County has been variable and did meet the Healthy People 2020 target four times (2010, 2012, 2014 and 2018) in a thirteen year period. See Exhibit 163 below: Exhibit 163 : Low Birth Weight Trends - McLean County, 2007 - 2019 Source: Conduent Healthy Communities Institute, Illinois Department of Public Health, 201 9. Very Low Birth Weight (<1,500 grams; less than 3 pounds, 5 ounces) In 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021, the percent of infants born with very low birth weight at Carle BroMenn Medical Center and at OSF St. Joseph Medical Center was lower than the Healthy People 2020 goal to reduce very low birth weight to 1.4 percent of live births. See Exhibit 164 below. Exhibit 164 : Number and Percentage of Very Low Birth Weight Infants (<1500 grams or 3 pounds, 5 ounces born in McLean County Hospitals, 2018 - 2021 Carle BroMenn Medical Center OSF St. Joseph Medical Center 2018 2019 2020 2021 2018 2019 2020 2021 # VLBW Infants 1 2 5 11 1 2 0 2 # Live Births 1434 1333 1383 1276 734 Medical Center, 2018 - 2021 . Pre-term births are those infants that are born at less than 37 weeks gestation. In McLean County, 10.5 percent of the births are pre -term, which is in the best 0 - 50th percentile range (green indicator) when compared to other counties in Illinois and is lower than the Illinois value (10.7 percent). It is, however, higher than McLean County's prior value (9.8%) and the Healthy People 2030 goal of 9.4 percent (Conduent He althy Communities Institute, Illinois Department of Public Health, 201 9). Congenital Anomalies Birth defects can occur at any stage of pregnancy, but most occur during the first trimester when the infant's organs are developing. In Illinois, a report published in April 2021 notes that birth defects are the leading cause of infant mortality in the United States and the second leading cause of infant mortality in Illinois (Illinois Department of Public Health, Illinois Adverse Pregnancy Outcomes Reporting System (APORS ), Trends in the Prevalence of Birth Defects in Illinois 2002 - 2018, April 2021). In the United States, birth defects affect one in every 33 infants (approximately three percent of all infants) born in the United States each year, and account for 20% of all infant deaths (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Data and Statistics on Birth Defects, 2022). For McLean County, the Illinois Department of Public Health's IQuery data system notes that there were one to 11 deaths per year (2000 - 2020) due to congenital malformations, deformations and chromosomal abnormalities. In Illinois, deaths from these causes during the same time period ranged from a low of 332 (2019) to a high of 490 (2003) (Illinois Department of Public Health, IQuery Data System, 2020). Child Well -Being Child Well -Being Ranking The Annie E. Casey Foundation publishes the Kids Count Data Book and ranks the 50 U.S. states on child well -being using five categories: Overall Rank , Economic Well -Being , Education , Health , and Family and Community. In the 2020 report, the following rankings for child well -being were provided for Illinois in comparison to the other 49 states (Annie E. Casey Foundation, Kids Count Data Book: 2020 State Trends in Child Well -Being, June 2020): Overall Rank: 24 Economic Well -Being: 21 Education: 12 Health: 20 Family and Community: 9 Rankings at a county level are not provided. Key findings: Maternal and Child Health The infant mortality rate for McLean County exceeds the Healthy Pe ople 2030 goal. A comparison of the 2009, 2016 and 2019 Illinois Department of Public Health Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) anonymous survey results revealed gains in pre -conception health, a reduction in smoking during the three month s before pregnancy and the last three months of pregnancy, and an improvement in the percent of postpartum women who breastfed at least once and who placed infants on their backs most of the time. The rate of cesarean sections performed during labor and d elivery in McLean County has been consistently higher than both the Illinois and national rates. McLean County percentage of mothers who report smoking during pregnancy did not meet the Healthy People 2030 target. A Non -Hispanic Black woman is three times more likely to die from a preg nancy -related condition than a N on- Hispanic White woman . A Non -Hispanic Black woman is more likely to die from pregnancy -related medical conditions than a Non - Hispanic White woman . A Non -Hispanic White woman is more likely to die from pregnancy -related mental health conditions . Women on Medicaid during pregnancy were three times as likely to die within one year of pregnancy as women with private insurance . The breastfeeding rate at a local hospital is higher than the state and nation. The rate of births to adolescents in McLean County is lower than the Illinois and United States rates and it meets and exceeds the Healthy People 2030 goal. McLean County's infant mortality rate, although decreasing since its high level in 2011, re mains higher than the Illinois rate and the Healthy People 2030 goal. It falls in the worst 50th - 75th percentile (yellow indicator) compared to other counties in Illinois. VI. Prioritization of Health -Related Issues k) Community Health Survey: Percepti ons of Health Issues, Unhealthy B ehaviors and Issues Impacting Quality of Life To aid in identifying the high priority health issues in McLean County, the 2021 McLean County Community Health Survey asked respondents to report on their perceptions of the th ree most important health issues, unhealthy behaviors and factors that contribute to well -being in the community. Perceptions of Health Issues 2021 McLean County Community Health S urvey respondents percei ved their community as having the following top three major h ealth issues: mental health, being overweight and/or obese and COVID -19. Twenty -six percent of survey respondents feel mental health is the biggest health issue, 16 percent feel that obesity/overweight is a top health issue and 14 perce nt resp onded that viruses (COVID -19) is the third top issue. See Exhibit 165 below. Exhibit 165: Perception of Health Issues - McLean County, 20 21 Source: McLean Coun ty Community Health Survey, 2021 . Comparison to the 2018 McLean County Community Health Survey Comparison data is not available since 2018 respondents were allowed to select three choices rather than one choice in the 2022 survey. Perception of Issues Impacting Quality of Life Survey respondents were asked to select the three most important issues impacting well -being in the community (See Exhibit 166). The three top issues impacting well -being are access to healthcare (20 percent), healthy food choices (14 percent) and less hat red (10 percent).

Health disparities adversely affect groups of people who have systematically experienced greater obstacles to health based on their racial or ethnic group; religion ; socioeconomic status; gender; age; mental health; cognitive, sensory, or physical disability; sexual orientation or gender identity; geographic location; or other characteristics historically linked to discrimination or exclusion.\" (Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, Healthy People 2030, 2022). This section highlights the key health disparities that emerged for McLean County. Geographic Disparities Individuals living in specific geographic areas of McLean County experience worse he alth outcomes than individuals living in other geographic areas. The ZIP code s that were identified through Conduent Healthy Com munities Institute's Health Equity Index as having the highest Health Equity Needs ranking (5) in McLean C ounty are Bellflower Z IP Code 61724 and Bloomington ZIP code 61701 . Exhibit 168 below lists the ten ZIP code s in McLean County that have the highest Health Equity Needs rankings (5 or 4). Exhibit 168 : High Health Equity Needs ZIP Codes in McLean County, 2021 City/Town ZIP Code Health Equity Ranking Population Bellflower 61724 5 488 Bloomington 61701 5 Claritas, 2021 . The greatest geographic disparities compared to other ZIP codes in Illinois are evident for Bloomington ZIP code 61701. Exhibit 169 below shows that Bloomington ZIP code 61701 is in the worst 25th percentile range (red indicator) compared to other ZIP codes in Illinois for emergency room visits due to alcohol use, adult asthma, asthma (all ages) pediatric and adult mental health, diabetes, Type 2 diabetes and both adolescent and adult suicide and self -inflicted injury in comparison to other ZIP codes in I llinois . Addi tionally, Bellflower ZIP code 61724 is in the worst 25th percentile range (red indicator) compared to other ZIP codes in Illin ois for adult mental health. McLean ZIP code 61754 is in the worst 25th percentile range (red indicator) in comparison to other ZIP codes in Il linois for adult suicide and self -inflicted injury and pediatric mental health.

Racial and Ethnic Disparities When looking at all chronic conditions listed in Exhibit 174 below, Blacks or African Americans have higher rates of disparities than any other race in McLean County, based on emergency room visits. Similarly, Hispanic s or Latinos have greater disparities in Type 2 Diabetes, alcohol use and hypertension when compared to the rate for McLean County. Exhibit 174 : Age -Adjusted Emergency Room Visits per 10,000 Population by Race /Ethnicity - McLean County , 2018 - 2020 Source: Conduent Healthy Communities Institute, Illinois Hospital Association, 2018 - 2020 . Many factors contribute to health disparities such as income level, education level and stable housing environment. According to the 2021 McLean County Community Health Survey , commercial/employer insurance is used more often by White people and those with higher education and income. Private insurance tends to be rated lower by Black people, and those with an unstable (e.g. homeless) housing environment. Individuals with a higher income use a clinic or doctor's office more often and report ease of access t o dental care and prescription medication . Access to dental care tends to be lower for Hispanics or Latinos and the emergency room tends to be used more often by Blacks or African Americans, those that are less educated, have a lower income and by people w ith an unstable (e.g. ; homeless) housing environment. Emergency Departments are used less often by White people. Individuals with lower incomes and who are less educated are l ess likely to seek medical care . Lastly, f requency of breast exams tend s be rated higher by White women and those with higher education and income. Frequency of breast exams tends to be rated lower by Black women and those with an unstable (e.g. ; homeless) housing environment. m) Priority Setting Process To maximize the effec tiveness of the Community Health Improvement Plan that will result from th e 2022 McLean County Community Health Needs Assessment, it was necessary for the health issues presented above to be prioritized and narrowed to a select few to address . By determining the most important health issues, it is hoped that more significant advances can be made in a shorter amount of time. In the fall of 2021 and early 2022 , the Executive Steering Committee met every other week to analyze the primary and secondary data presented in this report . By considering the criteria below, the Executive Steering Committee identified the significant health needs to present to the McLean County Community Hea lth Council for prioritization: Size of the issue Rates worse th an Illinois counties or state rate Disparities by race/ethnicity/age/gender Disparities by ZIP code Percent of indic ators trend ing unfavorably in a statistically significant direction Does not meet Healthy People (HP) 2020 or HP 2030 target Does working o n the issue impact other issues for collective impact? Seven Significant Health Needs Identified for Prioritization The seven significant health needs that were presented to the McLean County Community Health Council for prioritization at three meetings held on January 27 , February 1 0 and February 24, 2022 were: Access to Care Behavioral Health (mental health and substance use) Diabetes Healthy Eating and Active Living (exercise, nutrition , obesity and food access/insecurity) Heart Disease Oral Health Respiratory Disease . McLean County Community Health Council Prioritization Meeting s In order to ensure the safety of McLean County Community Health Council Members from COVID -19, all three prioritization meetings were held virtually. January 27, 2022 The purpose of the first meeting was to explain the collaborative nature of the joint 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment between Carle BroMenn Medical Center , the McLean County Health Department, OSF St. Joseph Medical Center and Chestnut Health System s, in addition to the end goal of producing a joint Community Health Improvement Plan for McLean County . Annual Report h ighlights from 2020 and 2021 for the 2020 - 2022 McLean County Community Health Improvement Plan were also reviewed with the council. February 10, 2022 During the second meeting, the Executive Steering Committee presented detailed data on the significant health needs identified for prioritization. Age, gender, race/ethnic ity and ZIP code disparities were shared when available. Data for the social determinants of health was also reviewed with the council. Questions from council members were addressed throughout the data presentation. At the conclusion of the meeting, data summaries for the top seven health needs were em ailed to the counci l in addition to the presentation given by the Executive Steering Committee during the meeting. February 24, 2022 During the final prioritization meeting, the Hanlon prioritiz ation method was used to the select the three significant health needs for the 2022 McLean County Community Health Needs Assessment and around which the 2023 - 2025 McLean County Co mmunity Health Improvement P lan will be developed . The Hanlon Method, developed by J.J. Hanlon, was the prioritization method utilized by the McLean County Community Health Council to select three significant health needs for McLean County to address through a joint Community Health Improvement Plan . The Hanlon Method is a well -respected quantitative technique promoted by the National Association of County and City Health Officials (NACCHO) . Prioritization ratings are based on the size of the health problem, seriousness of the health problem and effectiveness of available inter ventions. As shown in Exhibit 175, prioritization ratings are given on a scale of zero to 10. Exhibit 1758: Hanlon Method Criteria , 2009 Rating Size of the Health Problem (% of population w/ health problem) Seriousness of the Health Problem Effectiveness of A vailable Interventions 9 or 10 >25% Very serious 80% - 100% effective 7 or 8 10% - 24.9% Relatively serious 60% - 80% effective 5 or 6 1% - 9.9% Serious 40% - 60% effective 3 or 4 0.1 % - 0.9% Moderately serious 20% - 40% effective 1 or 2 0.01% - 0.09% Relatively not serious 5% - 20% effective 0 <.01% Not serious <5% effective Source: National Association of City and County Health Officials, First Things First: Prioritizing Health Problems, 2009. The following guidelines helped determine the ratings for each criterion: Size of the health problem or percent of the population with the health problem : o The average size rating of numerous indicators for each health issue was calculated to arrive at an overall size rating . o The midpoint of the range for percent of population with a health problem was used to determine a single size rating per indicator . For example , 0.05 percent of the population 18 years and older visits the emergency room due to opioid use. This percentage falls in the r ange of 0.01 percent to 0.09 percent for a size rating of one or two . The midpoint for this range is . 05 percent . Since 0.05 percent is equal to or greater than the midpoint of 0.05 percent, i t is given a size rating of two . Seriousness of the health problem; the following questions were taken into consideration when rating seriousness: o Does it require immediate attention? o Is there public demand to address the issue? o What is the economic impact? o What is the impact on quality of life? o Is there a high hospitalization and death rate? o Are there severe disparities associated with this issue? Is the issue more prevalent in certain populations or ZIP codes? Is the morbidity burden greater in certain populations? Are certain populations more likely to die of this condition? Effectiveness of available interventions ; the following questions were taken into consideration when rating effectiveness of available interventions: o Are prevention programs effective in preventing the issue? o Do treatment programs effectively address the health issue? o Are there best practices/evidence -based programs (EBP's) or interventions that are available to address the health issue? McLean County Community Health Council members were provided with an explanation of the Hanlon Method from the National Association of County and C ity Health Officials ( Appendix 6) to assist with rating the seriousness and effectiveness of each health problem. The size ratings were pre -populated by the Executive S teering Committee in the Hanlon Method Table and pro vided to the council ( Appendix 7) to decrea se subjectivity . See Appendix 8 for specifics about each size rating estimation for the top seven health priorities. Prior to voting on the significant health needs for the 2022 McLean County Community Health Needs Asses sment and the 2023 - 2025 McLean County Community Health Improvement Plan , the 'PEARL' test was applied to the seven significant health needs . The 'PEARL' test is used to screen out health problems based on the following feasibility factors: Propriety: Is the program for the health problem suitable? Economics: Does it make economic sense to address the problem? Are there economic consequences if a problem is not addressed? Acceptability: Will a community accept the program s to address the problem ? Is it wa nted? Resources: Is funding available or potentially available for a program? Legality: Do current laws allow program activities to be implemented? If the answer to any of the questions above is no for any of the significant health needs , then it is eliminated as a choice for prioritization . The council did not answer no to any questions for any of the seven significant health needs , so all seven issues were voted upon by the council according to the Hanlon Method criteria. Prior to elec tronic voting, council members were divided into five breakout rooms for fifteen minutes, with one executive steering committee member in each room, to allow for group discussion prior to voting. The breakout rooms allow ed for the opportunity for council members to discuss questions, share ideas and/or thought processes related to voting . At the conclusion of the breakout rooms, each group shared the highlights from their breakout room discussion. Council members were given fif teen minutes to vote electronically. After voting, t he next step in the process was to calculate the priority scores for each of the health issues . Exhibit 176 below illustrates the results of the Hanlon Method scoring wi th behavioral health, access to care and healthy eating/active living receiving the top scores. Exhibit 176: Hanlon Method Prioritization Results , 2022 Source: McLean County Community Health Council Meeting February 2 4, 2022 . n) Health Needs Selected As illustrated in Exhibit 176 above , access to care , behavioral health and healthy eating/active living received the top three priority scores according to the Hanlon method calculations with scores of 172.9, 159 and 157.5 , respectively . There was a clear divide in the scores between t he top t hree issues and the bottom four : diabetes, heart disease, oral health and respiratory disease. Following a group discussion, the McLean County Community Health Council agreed to select the top three health needs as the ones with the highest priority scores . They are listed below . Access to Care Access to care was selected as a significant health need to be addressed by the McLean County Community Health Council not only because of its high priority score (1 72.9 ), but for several other reasons. Access to care is an important issue that affects many health outcomes. Improving access in certain areas and for certain populations can have a widespread impact on a variety of health outco mes . Data presented to the counc il also indicated that there are significant geographic and racial/ethnic disparities in McLean County that may be related to access to care . Access to health care was also rated by the 2021 McLean County Community Health Survey respondents as the number on e issue affecting quality of life . Council members suggested that there are a variety of factors that c an improve access to care ranging from health equity to transportation . Access to care was also selected as a health priority for the 2016 and 2019 McLea n County Community Health Needs Assessment s. Behavioral Health (Me ntal Health and Substance Abuse) Behavioral health was selected as a significant health need to be addressed by the McLean County Community Health Council for several reasons . Behavioral health received the second highest priority score (1 59.0) , indicating the need for further improvements in this area in McLean County. There are numerous geographic and racial/ethnic disparities for behavioral health related indicators. In addit ion, m ental health was rated as the top health issue by 2021 McLean County Community Health Survey respondents. There has been a great deal of public su pport and momentum behind behavioral health in McLean County for the last several years . McLean County i s well situated to continue to collaborate on mental health care due to the ongoing efforts of numerous organizations and the support of the McLean County Government . Mental health was also previously selected as a key health priority for the 2016 and 2019 McLean County Community Health Needs Assessment s. Healthy Eating/Active Living Healthy eating/active living was selected as a significant health need to be addressed by the McLean County Community Health Council because it ranked as number three according to its priority score of 1 57.5 . Additionally, the council felt that by focusing on healthy eating/active living , many other health outcomes such as heart disease, cancer and diabetes may also be positively impacted. This issue was also sele cted because obesity was the second top perceived health issue , according to the 2021 McLean County Community Health Survey respondents , and poor eating habits was the second most important perceived issue impacting health. Food insecurity and food access are a lso areas needing improvement in McLean County. Healthy Eating/Active Living was selected as a health priority for the 2019 McLean County Community Health Needs Assessment. Obesity was selected as a health priority for the 2016 McLean County Community Heal th Needs Assessment. o) Health Needs Not Selected Diabetes Diabetes will not be addressed because it was ranked seventh with a priority score of 71.4 and the McLean County Community Health Council did not feel that there was a compelling reason to eliminat e one of the top three ranked health issues. Council members also felt that diabetes improvements could be made with a focus on access to care and healthy eating/active living. Heart Disease Heart disease will not be addressed because it was ranked f ifth according to its priority score of 96.0 and the McLean County Community Health Council did not feel that there was a compelling reason to eliminate one of the health issues that ranked in the top three. The council did discuss that improving access to care may also improve health outcomes for heart disease, particularly in areas of high socioeconomic needs. Oral Health Although oral health is deemed as an extremely important issue in McLea n County, the McLean County Community Health Council agreed to address the three needs that received the highest priority scores. Oral health was ranked fourth with a score of 112 . The council did discuss that oral health is an access issue and can be addressed under access to care. The opening of a new dental clinic at the Community Health Care Clinic in early 2019 for individu als without health insurance is improving oral health care access . Respiratory Disease Respiratory disease was not selected as a health need to be addressed as it ranked sixth according to i ts priority score of 90.0 and the McLean County Community Health Council did not feel that there was a compelling reason to eliminate one of the health concerns that ranked in the top three. The council did discuss that improving access to care may also improve health outcomes for respiratory disease , particularly in areas of high socioeconomic needs. VII. Overview of Imp rovement Plan Goals and Community Resources In April 2022 , three priority action team meetings were held to establish a high -level goal for each significant health need/ priority . Priority action team s consist ed of current and new key community stakeholders with an interest or expertise in the prioritized health issue . Cross -sector representation was sought f or each priority action team. The health needs identified in the 2019 McLean County Community Health Needs Assessment are the same as the newly identified health needs for the 2022 McLean County Community Health Needs Assessment. A facilitator from the McLean County E xecutive Steering Committee led a discussion for each p riority action team to reach consensus for the high -level goal for the 2022 McLean County Community Health Needs Assessment priorities and the 2023 - 2025 McLean County Community Health I mprovement Plan . The goals agreed upon by each priority action team are listed below. a) 2023 - 2025 Health Priority Goals Access to Care The Access to Care Priority Action Team meeting was held on April 14, 2022 . The following goal was established during the meeting: Advance and advocate for equitable and affirming access to care and other resources, which address social determinants of health, to improve the health and wellbeing of our diverse community by 2026. Behavioral Health The Behavioral H ealth Priority Action T eam meeting was held on April 19, 2022 . The following goal was established during the meeting: Further equitable, inclusive, and integrated systemic community approaches to behavioral health and well -being for our diverse community b y 2026. Healthy Eating/Active Living The Healthy Eating/Active Living Priority Action Team meeting was held on April 7, 2022 . The following goal was established during the meeting: Promote equitable opportunities for healthy eating and active living to strengthen the health and well -being of our diverse community by 2026. b) Community Resources for the 2020 - 2022 Community Health Improvement Plan Health Priority Goals In the fall of 2022 , the priority action teams will meet to determine the resources, interventions and outcome met rics for each priority. The 2023 - 2025 McLean County Community Health Improvement Plan will again be a joint plan for the entire county and consist of interventions and resources to be provided by the hospitals, health depart ment, family health center and numerous social services or other community organizations. Community resources specific to the three health prior ities are listed in Appendices 9 and 10 . VIII.
