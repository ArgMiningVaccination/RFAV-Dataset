BRIEFING DOCUMENT. MEETING DATE: 10 December 2020 Vaccine efficacy - overview 7 Vaccine efficacy - severe disease 8 Vaccine efficacy - one dose 9 Vaccine efficacy - one dose (source: JCVI report) What is the level of evidence of the harm of the intervention? 11 Safety endpoint Data Reactogenicity and adverse events Frequent, mostly mild to moderate Less frequency and severity in adults (55 years of age) than in younger adults (18-55 years of age) Generally higher after 2 nd dose compared to first (all ages) Lymphadenopathy Vaccine n=64, placebo n=6 Occurred in the arm and neck region within 2 to 4 d ays after vaccination Plausible relation to vaccination Bell`s palsy Vaccine n=4, placebo n=0 Observed frequency consistent with background rate in general population No clear basis upon which to conclude a causal rela tionship at this time, further surveillance Severe allergic reactions 0 reported anaphylactic re actions in the clinical trials Exclusion criteria- significant allergic reaction to any vaccine or component of BNT162b 137 [0.63%] hypersensitivity-related AEs in the vac cine group vs 111 [0.51%] in the placebo group Safety - reactogenicity, lymphadenopathy, Bell's pal sy and severe allergic reactions 12 Safety - Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) Deaths: 6 total (2 vaccine, 4 placebo) Vaccine group deaths (both >55 years of age) Cardiac arrest 62 days after Dose 2; died 3 days la ter Atherosclerotic disease; died 3 days after Dose 1, with baseline obesity Non-fatal SAEs Appendicitis (8 vaccine, 4 placebo) Possibly-related SAEs (FDA conclusion) Shoulder injury: vaccine administration or vaccine itself There were no other specific safety concerns identi fied in subgroup analyses by age, race, ethnicity, medical comorbidities, or prior SARS-CoV-2 infectio n. 13 Safety - Special Considerations: PEGylation (or ation) The BNT162b2 vaccine contains four lipids. The lipi ds encapsulate the mRNA in the form of a lipid nanoparticle to aid cell entry, ensure stability an d an adjuvant effect. Two of the lipids are used in approved medicinal pr oducts (cholesterol and 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3 - phosphocholine (DSPC)) and two have not been common ly used in an authorised lipid conju gate (i.e. PEGylated lipid). The primary function of the PEGylated lipid ALC-015 9 is to form a protective hydrophilic layer that sterically stabilises the lipid nanoparticle, which contributes to storage stability and reduces nonspe cific binding to proteins. The potential role of the ALC-0159 containing PEG i n the anaphylactic reactions needs to be determined . NIAID and FDA study to analyze the response to the vaccine in people with high levels of anti-PEG antibodies or have experienced severe allergic resp onses to drugs or vaccines before. 14 Outcome Importance Finding Strength of evidence BENEFIT Symptomatic lab confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection Critical BNT162b2 is effective in preventing symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections high Hospitalization due to COVID-19 Important BNT162b2 may prevent hospitalizations due to COVID-19 moderate Death Important BNT162b2 may prevent deaths but the uncertainty is high as death is a rare outcome in the trial low Asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection Important Not addressed in the trial no data HARM Serious adverse events Critical SAEs were balanced in the intervention and placebo group moderate Reactogenicity Important Severe reactions were more c ommon in the intervention group; any grade at 3 and above was reported in 8.8% of vaccinees vs 2.1% in placebo recipients high 2Summary on the Evidence Assessment Values Does the target population feel that the desirable outcome outweighs undesirable outcomes? 16 Value Limited available evidence suggests that target pop ulations probably value the desirable effects more than their concern about undesirable effects relate d to COVID-19 vaccination. Common concerns include the speed of development, t he lack of long-term safety data, conspiracy theories (\"mRNA vaccines may genetically modify hum ans\") and unsubstantiated rumors. Acceptability Is the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 mRNA vaccine accepta ble to key stakeholders and the target group? 18 Which option is acceptable to key stakeholders (Min istries of Health, Immunization Managers)? No scientific evidence available; 190 economies par ticipating in COVAX suggest a very high acceptabili ty of COVID-19 vaccination in general, although not of this vaccine in particular. As vaccination is an eagerly awaited tool in combat ting COVID-19, it is assumed that key stakeholders, in particular Ministries of Health and Immunization Ma nagers are strongly in favor of COVID-19 vaccinatio n. 19 Is the intervention acceptable to target groups? A global survey (19 countries) on acceptance rates in the general population (any COVID-19 vaccine product), revealed that 71.5% of participants repor ted that they would be very or somewhat likely to t ake a COVID-19 vaccine. Differences in acceptance rates ranged from almost 55-87%. Reference: Lazarus JV, Ratzan SC, Palayew A, Gostin LO , Larson HJ, Rabin K, et al.

Feasibility Is BNT162b2 vaccine feasible to implement? 21 Barriers to implementation of mass vaccination Ultra-cold chain requirement (-60 to 80 Degrees Cel sius) Minimum size of orders Complex handling requirements Need for diluent 2 doses Costs 22 Implementation challenges Higher delivery cost Non-standard cold chain require ments will require new investments in capital equipment and special equipment for handling deep frozen shipments Extra training, supervision, monitoring and logistics will be required for HW as mRNA vaccine have not been used before Delivery of UCC vaccines 3-6 x more expensive than standard 2-8 Degrees Celsius Operational complexity may impact access Build up of capabilities will be required in countries that have no experience of delivering UCC vaccines Regulatory approval processes may take longer given that no mRNA based vaccines have yet been approved 2-6 months required for ramp up from no UCC capabilities in AMC92 Speed, Scale, Access 22 Resource Use Is BNT162b2 an efficient allocation of resources? 24 Resource Use Economic losses from the COVID-19 pandemic and cost -effectiveness of any vaccine programme will differ between countries and regions However, given the magnitude of social and economic impacts, it is expected that COVID-19 vaccination will be cost-effective from a societal perspective in many countries Cost-effectiveness analyses and economic impact of vaccination will depend on: - COVID-19 burden -timing of vaccine roll-out (at time of rise of cas es versus decline) -vaccination coverage levels achieved -duration of vaccine protection -vaccination implementation costs -other mitigation measures used Cost-effectiveness may not be the primary driver fo r decision-making during the pandemic 25 Equitable access to COVID -19 vaccine has large economic impacts AE: Advanced Economies EM: Emerging Markets IMF World Economic Outlook October 2020. https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WEO/Issues/202 0/09/30/world-economic-outlook-october-2020 RAND Europe. 2020. COVID-19 and the cost of vaccine nationalism. https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RRA769-1 .html GDP is projected to recover faster if COVID-19 vacci nation roll-out permits reduction in physical distancing, and travel and tr ade interruptions. Slower vaccination roll-out and inequitable vaccine access globally will result in greater GDP losses, including for high-income countr ies. Note: estimates are not specific to BNT162b2 or any other COVID-19 vaccine product. What would be the impact of BNT162b2 on health equity? 27 6 main principles -Human Vacc ines Accessed 10Dec2020: https://launchandscalefaster.or g/COVID-19 29 Equity concerns of BNT162b2 Several factors may increase inequity: cost, ultra- cold chain storage and transportation, minimum numb er of doses per shipment, need to administer a whole b atch of vaccines within a short time frame, need fo r diluent. Conditions must be met to avoid exposure of v ials to sun light and ultraviolet light. Appropriate medical treatment to manage anaphylaxis must be immediately available. Hence, this vaccine should only be administered in settings wit h the necessary resources and trained health worker s, and in settings that allow for 30 minutes of post-v accination observation and immediate care, if requi red. Need for 2 dose series may disadvantage homeless, n omads, persons living in remote places, and those with limited access to health care. Programmatic implications require particular attent ion to equity, including the feasibility, acceptabi lity, and effectiveness in resource-constrained settings 30 Addressing inequity within and between countries 31 E2R Question SAGE WG Judgement Public health problem Is the COVID-19 pandemic of public health importanc e? Yes Benefits and Harms How substantial are the desirable benefits of the i ntervention? Substantial How substantial are the undesirable harms of the in tervention? Small Do the benefits outweigh the risk/harm? Yes What is the overall certainty of the evidence for t he outcomes? High for prevention of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2Low for hospitalizations and death Moderate for safety Absent for impact on transmission Value Do the target populations value the desirable benef it as large relative to the undesirable risks/harms? Will vary within and between countries Acceptability Is BNT162b2 acceptable to key stakeholders? Probably yes Feasibility Is BNT162b2 feasible to implement? Very difficult but not impossible in many LMICs Resource use Is BNT162b2 a reasonable and efficient use of resou rces? Will vary within and between countries Equity What would be the impact of the intervention on hea lth equity within and between countries? Risk of increasing inequity "}
