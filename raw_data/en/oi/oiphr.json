The original schools\u2014Nursing and Medicine--have been joined by Allied Health Professions, Dentistry, Public Health, the Graduate School, and the Faculty of Religion. The University, operated by the Seventh-day Adventist Church, is committed to the vision of its founders and is sustained by its close association with the church. Loma Linda University is a Seventh-day Adventist coeducational, health-sciences institution located in inland southern California. It is part of the Seventh-day Adventistsystem of higher education. Professional curricula are offered by the Schools of AlliedHealth Professions, Dentistry, Public Health, Medicine, and Nursing. Graduate programsin various biomedical sciences are offered by departments of the schools. The profession-al curricula of the University are approved by their respective professional organizations. The most current campus census figures (July 1, 2003) indicate that the core of the combined faculties consists of 1,108 full-time teachers. Part-time and voluntary teachers,largely clinicians in the professional curricula, bring the total to 2,481. As of AutumnQuarter 2003, students from 97 countries are represented in the enrollment of 3,657. PHILOSOPHY As implied by its motto, \"TO MAKE MAN WHOLE,\" the University affirms thesetenets as central to its view of education: God is the creator and sustainer of the universe. Mankind's fullest development entails a growing understanding of the individ-ual in relation both to God and to society. The quest for truth and professional expertise, in an environment permeated by religious values, benefits the individual and society and advances the min-istry of the Seventh-day Adventist Church.10 LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITYOUR MISSION 11 Our Mission Linda University, a Seventh-day Adventist Christian health-sciences institu- tion, seeks to further the healing and teaching ministry of Jesus Christ \"to makeman whole\" by: Educating ethical and proficient Christian health professionals and scholarsthrough instruction, example, and the pursuit of truth; Expanding knowledge through research in the biological, behavioral, physi- cal, and environmental sciences and applying this knowledge to health anddisease; Providing comprehensive, competent, and compassionate health care for the whole person through faculty, students, and alumni.

It is committed to equal education and employmentopportunities for men and women of all races and does not discriminate on the basis of handicap, gender, race, color, or national origin in its educational or admissionspolicies, financial affairs, employment programs, student life and services, or anyUniversity-administered program. Any student with a documented disability (e.g., physical, learning, or psychological) who needs to arrange reasonable accommodation must contact the dean, or designee, ofthe School of Dentistry. All discussions will remain confidential. To this end, the University is in compliance with Titles VI and VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 as amended, and in substantial compliance with Title IX of the EducationAmendments of 1972 (34 CFR 106 et seq.), Sections 503 and 504 of the RehabilitationDiscrimination in Employment Act of 1967, and Section 402 of the Vietnam Era VeteransAdjustment Act of 1974; and does not discriminate against any employees or applicantsfor employment on the basis of age or because they are disabled veterans or veterans ofthe Vietnam era. In addition, the University administers student programs without dis-crimination on the basis of age, except in those programs where age is a bona fide acade-mic qualification for admission in accordance with the provisions of the Age Discrimina-tion Act of 1975. The University reserves constitutional and statutory rights as a religious institution and employer to give preference to Seventh-day Adventists in admissions and employ-ment, including but not limited 42 USC Secs. 12926(d)(1); Title II, Division 4, Chapter 2, Sec. 7286.5 of the CaliforniaCode of Regulations; the First Amendment to the United States Constitution; and ArticleI, Sec. 4, of the California Constitution. The University believes that Title IX regulationsare subject to constitutional guarantees against unreasonable entanglement with orinfringements on the religious teachings and practices of the Seventh-day Adventistchurch. The University expects students and employees to uphold biblical principles ofmorality and deportment as interpreted by the Seventh-day Adventist church. TheUniversity claims exemptions from the provisions of Title IX set forth in 34 UNIVERSITY Affirmative Action The University routinely monitors its educational and employment practices regarding women, minorities, and the handicapped to ensure compliance with thelaw and University policy. The University's affirmative-action policy is to provide equal access to admissions, educational programs and activities, financial aid, studentservices, and employment. In compliance with Title IX of the Educational Amendments of 1972 and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, a grievance procedure has been established to processstudent complaints alleging violation of these regulations or of the University's policy ofnondiscrimination based on gender or handicap. Inquiries concerning Title IX may bedirected to the affirmative-action officer. Employment-related discrimination complaints,including those filed by student employees, are processed in conformity with the provi-sions outlined in existing staff personnel policies. Complaints related to discrimination inacademic areas are reviewed in conformity with the procedures established by the aca-demic administration.UNIVERSITY CHURCH OF SEVENTH-DAY ADVENTISTS 15 16

Goodacre, D.D.S., M.S.D.Dean, School of Dentistry 22 SCHOOL OF DENTISTRYSCHOOL FOUNDATIONS 23 School Foundations HISTORY Asmall but determined group of dentists met during the summer of 1943 in Grand Ledge, Michigan. Their purpose was to form an organization that would serve asa catalyst, urging the Seventh-day Adventist Church to sponsor a dental school where young adults could learn the dental profession in an environment consistent withtheir religious beliefs. These men were the founders of the National Association ofSeventh-day Adventist Dentists (NASDAD). Under the leadership of Dr. J. Russell Mitchell, the organization's first president, the goal of a Christian dental school began taking conceptual form. NASDAD expanded inmembership and objectives through men such as Dr. C. C. Ray, who toured the country onhis own time in search of fellow Seventh-day Adventist dentists who were willing to pursueNASDAD's goals. Dr. M. Webster Prince served as president of NASDAD in 1948 and 1949. At a meet- ing in San Francisco in 1949, NASDAD members voted unanimously to support the dentalschool project. Later that year at a NASDAD session in Hinsdale, Illinois, the memberspledged a strong financial base in support of their goals. The momentum of the effort became evident in the early 1950s. The General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists, under the guidance of President W. H. Branson,asked Dr. Prince to conduct a feasibility study. Official action was taken in 1951 toauthorize establishment of the School of Dentistry as a unit of Loma Linda University'sSchool of Medicine. Dr. Prince was selected as the first dean of the School of Dentistry.His leadership in organizing and eventually administering the new School of Dentistrywas facilitated by his prior experience as president of the Michigan Dental Associationand as chair of the American Dental Association Council on Dental Education. Forty-twostudents comprised the inaugural class in the late fall of 1953. A dental hygiene curriculum leading to a Bachelor of Science degree was developed in 1959 under the direction of Dr. Gerald A. Mitchell, chair of the Department ofPeriodontics. Violet Bates became chair of the new department, and the first class of tendental hygienists graduated in 1961. In 1960 Dr. Charles T. Smith became dean. During this period the School experi- enced positive growth in many areas. A dental assisting curriculum was developed in1968 under the leadership of Betty Zendner. The first class graduated in 1969, receivingthe Associate in Science degree. A dental auxiliary utilization (DAU) program wasinitiated to provide enhanced learning for dental students. The Monument Valley Dental Clinic for Navajo Indians was started in 1966, and Dean Smith succeeded in finding frompublic sources fiscal support for the clinic building and for faculty housing. Newadvanced-education (postdoctoral) programs were initiated in five clinical disciplines:orthodontics, oral surgery, periodontics, endodontics, and oral pathology. During the 1970s the School of Dentistry continued its evolution into one of the pre- mier clinical programs in the United States. Dr. Judson Klooster became dean in 1971.One of his major contributions was the expansion of Prince Hall, which was completed inMay 1976. The new building more than doubled the number of clinical units; providedfacilities for specialized areas of clinical instruction; and included eight new research lab-oratories, new classrooms, seminar rooms, amphitheaters, urgently needed teacher officespace, and a commensurate expansion of support facilities and services. The Oral andMaxillofacial Surgery Clinic was remodeled, and an out-patient surgicenter was developedto meet the needs of those patients requiring general anesthesia for dental treatment. The School of Dentistry became an important regional resource for providing dental care for developmentally disabled children and adults, many of whom require such atreatment setting. The Biomaterials Research Laboratory was constructed; and newadvanced-education programs were initiated in pediatric dentistry, implant dentistry,dental anesthesiology, and prosthodontics. A new program was established in 1985 toprovide a U.S. dental education for foreign-trained dentists. An increasing number ofdental professionals from other countries were seeking an American education and theopportunity to practice dentistry in the United States or to gain advanced knowledge toshare in their own countries. The International Dentist Program continues to offer anintensive, two-year course of study leading to a D.D.S. degree. The program has added asix-month certificate program limited to dental missionaries from other countries whosense the need for updated continuing education. In 2000, the first major expansion of the School of Dentistry in more than twenty years added 15,000 square feet to Prince Hall on the east side and provided two newpatient entrances. The expanded Surgery Center for Dentistry and the enlarged PediatricDentistry Clinic were relocated to the ground floor. An additional student laboratory wasalso included on that level. On the second floor, the new space allowed for expansion ofthe predoctoral clinic, with thirty-six additional operatories.24 SCHOOL OF DENTISTRYL O M A L I N D A U N I V E R S I T Y 25 ACCREDITATIONS 25 ACCREDITATION Loma Linda University is accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges.

CORE VALUES Belief in God Respect for the Individual Principled Spirituality Student Focus Empathic Care Commitment to Service Pursuit of Truth Progressive Excellence Analytic Thinking Effective Communication26 SCHOOL OF DENTISTRYGeneral Information ADMINISTRATION The dean, the chief administrative officer of the School, is aided by administrative associates. The dean presides over major administrative sessions. The administra-tion and the faculty are responsible for determining curriculum requirements, admitting students, conducting continuing-education programs, encouraging activitiesand programs pertinent to the welfare and interest of students, assessing fitness for pro-motion and graduation, and carrying out other functions essential to the overall operationof the School. Department chairs preside over the teaching programs of the departmentsand are responsible for evaluation of faculty members and of student progress. CURRICULA The curricula at Loma Linda University School of Dentistry are designed to corre-late the basic biological sciences with the science and art of dentistry. Curriculaare under continuous review and are, therefore, subject to change and improve- ment without prior notice, as the need occurs. This BULLETIN contains the operating policy statements for the School of Dentistry educational programs. Any deviation from these policies must be approved by the Schoolof Dentistry administration. LEARNING ENVIRONMENT Because the study of dental sciences and arts is based on a foundation in essen-tially the same science subjects as are studied in medicine and allied health cur-ricula, the School of Dentistry shares the facilities for teaching basic sciences with the School of Medicine. Classrooms, laboratories, student lounges, teachers' offices, and clinical facilities related solely to dentistry occupy the School of Dentistry building named in honor of M. Webster Prince, the first dean. Prince Hall is on the University mall, facing theUniversity Church and adjacent to the Medical Center. The facilities effectively accommo-date collaboration with the Medical Center in ongoing research and service programs. The total resources of the University constitute a wealth of opportunity for the stu- dent with initiative and willingness to develop individual capacity to the fullest extent.Students find varied opportunities for serving and learning in the immediate Universitycommunity, in School-sponsored service learning clinics, in clinical and research electives, and in diverse volunteer programs.GENERAL INFORMATION 27PROGRAMS, DEGREES The School of Dentistry offers the following programs: 1.

Physical ability to carry out observation and communication activities, and the possession of sufficient motor and sensory abilities to practicegeneral dentistry. All materials submitted for admission should be sent to: Office of Admissions Loma Linda University, School of DentistryLoma Linda, CA 92350 Required Students preparing for the predoctoral program are required to complete a minimum of three acade-mic years with no fewer than 96 semester or 144quarter units in a college or university accredited bya regional accrediting association. Preference isgiven to applicants who have completed or will com-plete the requirements for a baccalaureate degreeprior to admission. A maximum of 64 semester or 96quarter units of credit may be accepted from anaccredited junior or community college. A complete academic year of classwork (8 semester or 12 quarter units) in general biology, gen-eral chemistry, organic chemistry, general physics,and English composition must be completed withinfive years prior to admission, with a grade of C orabove in each course. A minimum grade-point aver-age of 2.7 in science subjects and in nonscience sub-jects, averaged separately, is required. The averagegrade-point average for accepted students is substan-tially higher. Recommended The subjects listed as required form the minimum background for professional study. In order to be better prepared with specific vocabulary and understanding,the applicant should particularly include sciencecourses with content similar to courses offered duringthe first year of the professional curriculum. The appli-cant's purpose should be the pursuit of diverse knowl-edge, the cultivation of an inquiring mind, the practiceof efficient methods of study, and the habit of thinkingand reasoning independently. These are of paramountimportance to the applicant's development as a uniqueand responsible human being. The choice of electives can broaden the appli- cant's view of the scope of knowledge. Being well-read will give a perspective on the sweep of humanthought throughout the ages, and often this will be ofAdmissions Information Loma Linda University was established to provide professional health education in a distinctively Christian environment that prepares well-qualified, dedicated Christiandentists who are committed to serving humanity. No religious test is applied, but students of Loma Linda University School of Dentistry (LLUSD) are expected to uphold thestandards and ideals of this church-related school. Prospective students have the freedomto choose or reject such concepts, but this decision must be made prior to enrollment. In selecting students for entrance to programs in the School, the Admissions Committee looks for evidence of self-discipline, personal integrity, and intellectual vigor. Anapplicant accepted to the School of Dentistry must possess the capabilities required to com-plete the full curriculum in the allotted time at the levels of competence required, as statedin the School of Dentistry Technical Standards outlined in this section. Some programsrequire an interview with faculty. Members of the Seventh-day Adventist Church are givenpreference. Acceptance of an applicant into any curriculum is contingent on the recom-mendation of the department conducting the program. The University's emphasis on healthand the health professions, as well as the practices of the supporting church, preclude theadmission of applicants who use tobacco, alcoholic beverages, or narcotics.ADMISSIONS INFORMATION 2930 SCHOOL OF DENTISTRY assistance in written and verbal communication and will improve the ability to think and express oneselfwell. Psychological, social, philosophical, and reli-gious insights will help to develop basic resources forthe solution of personal problems and the growth ofthat self-understanding the student must first havein order to understand and help associates. Dental Admission Test The applicant is required to complete and must meet specific criteria related to performance on the Dental Admission Test (DAT). Preference is given toapplicants who have taken the test no later thanOctober of the academic year preceding that forwhich admission is desired. The student entering thefirst year is expected to have taken the test withinthe past two years. If the test has been taken morethan one time, the most recent scores are used foradmission criteria. The committee reviews all scoreson the test, giving priority to the academic averagescore and the perceptual ability score. Transfer, course waiver Credits from professional schools (business, medical technology, nursing, pharmacy, or medi- cine) do not fulfill admission requirements. Creditfor studies taken at a military service school is grant-ed to veterans according to recommendations in theGuide of the American Council on Education and/or the California Committee for the Study ofEducation. The University reserves the right torequire satisfactory completion of written or practi-cal examinations in any course for which transfercredit is requested. An applicant from a college or university outside the United States or Canada or from anonaccredited college or university in the UnitedStates must complete a minimum of one full acade-mic year (24 semester or 36 quarter credits) in com-petition with other preprofessional students in anaccredited college or university in the United States.A grade of C or above in each course completed isrequired. (A grade of C- will not be accepted.) A course requirement may be waived if the applicant has previously taken the course andearned a grade of B or above, but no credit results.Evaluation for waiver of courses will be completedonly after an applicant has been accepted to the pro-gram, and must be approved by the course directorat this University and the School's associate dean foracademic affairs. Tuition is not reduced if coursesare waived or if a student takes less than a full load. Transfer from another school of dentistry in the United States is not recommended and is consideredonly in unusual circumstances. An applicant shouldexpect to begin at the first-year level and will be con-sidered only if there is space available at the appro-priate level or in the dental class desired. An applica-tion will be issued when the following informationhas been received: letter from applicant, stating reason for request- ing transfer; letter of recommendation from the dean of the dental school where the applicant is enrolled; official transcripts sent directly to theUniversity for both predental and dental schoolcourses completed; Dental Admission Test results. Application procedure The School participates in the American Association of Dental Schools Application Service(AADSAS). Cards requesting an AADSAS applicationare available at most colleges and universities andalso on the Internet at <www.adea.org>; or e-mail at<aadsas@adea.org>. The application should to becompleted and returned to the Washington addressindicated on the application. AADSAS processes thisapplication and sends copies to the schools of theapplicant's choice. The School of Dentistry at LomaLinda University recommends that applicants filetheir AADSAS application before October 1 in orderto be competitive. The application deadline isDecember 1 in order to be given consideration forthe next entering class. The following is a step-by-step process for completing an application to LomaLinda University. 1.Supplementary application . When an AADSAS application arrives at Loma Linda University, itis screened; and qualified applicants are sent asupplementary application for the School ofDentistry. 2.Supplementary written materials . The applicant must return the completed supplementaryapplication and materials within 30 days. Thisincludes: an essay specific to Loma LindaUniversity, a wallet-sized photograph, and theapplication fee of $60. 3.Transcripts . Official transcripts may be sent to AADSAS and then released by AADSAS to theSchool of Dentistry. When an applicant be-comes an accepted student, official transcripts,mailed directly from all colleges/universities, arerequired. An applicant's file will not be givenconsideration by the Admissions Committeeuntil all official transcripts are on file. 4.References . The applicant is asked to supply a minimum of three personal references. It is rec-ommended that these include an academic ref-erence from a science instructor; a referencefrom an employer; a character or religious refer-ence such as from a minister; and a referencefrom a friend in the dental profession. If theapplicant has attended a college or universitythat has a preprofessional committee that pre-pares a preprofessional evaluation, it is requiredthat Loma Linda University be sent a copy ofthis evaluation from the committee. Members ofthe applicant's family are excluded from writingthe required letters of reference, although let-ters will be accepted for the file in addition tothose required. Recommendation letters may besent to AADSAS and then released by AADSASto Loma Linda University School of Dentistry. 5.Dental Admission Test . The applicant is required to complete and must meet specific criteria relat-ed to performance on the Dental Admission Test(DAT). The student entering the first year isL O M A L I N D A U N I V E R S I T Y 31 expected to have taken the test within the past two years. If the test has been taken more thanone time, the most recent scores are used foradmission criteria. The DAT scores must be onfile at Loma Linda University before an accep-tance to the School will be issued. Test resultsshould be sent to Loma Linda University, Schoolof Dentistry, Office of Admissions. 6.Interview . The applicant's file will be screened when the supplementary application, recom-mendations, and transcripts are on file. Theapplicant may then be invited to the School for a personal interview. An interview is requiredfor admission. The interview provides an oppor-tunity for evaluation of noncognitive factors,including communication skills, personal val-ues, motivation, and commitment to goals ofthe profession; as well as genuine concern forothers in the service of dentistry. At the time ofthe interview, a tour of the School will be givenby a current student in the program. 7.Acceptance . The accepted student receives an acceptance letter and a follow-up letter withinformation relative to required forms anddeposit deadlines. 8. Pre-entrance health requirements / Immunizations It is expected that necessary routine dental and medical care will have been attended to beforethe student registers. New students are required to have certain immunizations and tests before registration.Forms to document the required immunizationsare provided for the physician in the acceptancepacket sent to the student by the School. Inorder to avoid having a hold placed on the regis-tration packet, the student is encouraged toreturn the documentation forms in the providedenvelope to Student Health Service no later than six weeks prior to the beginning of classes. Students enrolling in the School of Dentistry must provide documentation of having had thefollowing of two previous MMRs) PPD (TB) skin test (current skin test result or x-ray report) Tetanus/Diphtheria booster Chicken pox blood test and/or immunization: If no known history of chicken pox, then stu- dent may choose blood test (which may revealpre-existing immunity) and/or immunization(if no prior immunity). Hepatitis-B vaccination series Students who know themselves to have hadhepatitis-B in the past should employ extra pro-tection when involved in direct patient care andmay request a modified curriculum, if neces-sary. This series of three vaccinations may becompleted at this University (even if it wasbegun elsewhere) through the Student HealthService. (The student will be charged a fee.) A recent eye examination performed by an ophthalmologist or optometrist. For further information, consult the Student Handbook 2002, Section V\u2014University Policies: Communicable disease transmissionprevention policy; and the Student HealthService office, extension 88770. If a returning student is assigned to a clinicalfacility that requires a tuberculosis skin test, thenthe student is required to have the test within thesix months before the assignment begins. 9.Deposits . The student accepted into dentistry must submit a deposit of $1000 and therequired forms to the Admissions Office. Alldeposits become part of the first quarter'stuition. Failure to submit this deposit will resultin the loss of the applicant's position in theclass. The remaining balance of the first quar-ter's tuition and fees is due no later than the dayof matriculation in late September. If the appli-cant has submitted a completed application forfinancial aid by March 2, and if the Staffordapplication has been submitted by June 15, thefinal installment can be paid utilizingUniversity-assisted sources. TECHNICAL STANDARDS In harmony with its own education, research, andservice objectives, and using the American Dental Educators Association suggested guidelines, LomaLinda University School of Dentistry has identifiedtechnical standards for its programs. The qualifiedapplicant will meet, or will have the potential tomeet, the following technical standards\u2014standardsthat every student in the dentistry programs isexpected to reach. Cognitive abilities School of Dentistry students must have abilities that allow them to accurately and effectively mea- sure, verify, calculate, reason, analyze, and synthe-size. Students must be able to comprehend three-dimensional relationships and to understand thespatial relationships of structures to fully and com-pletely solve dental problems. In addition, studentsmust be able to visualize and comprehend physicaldemonstrations in the classroom, laboratory, andclinic. Effective problem solving requires students togather, organize, and assess relevant information toarrive at an integrated solution. Observation For learning to occur, students will be required to observe and interpret demonstrations and experi- ences. Such observation requires the functional use ofvision, touch, hearing, and somatic sensation.Observation is further enhanced by the sense of smell. Students must be able to acquire information from written documents; and to visualize informa-tion presented in images from papers, films, slides,or videos. They must be able to interpret radiograph-ic and other graphic images, with or without the useADMISSIONS INFORMATION 31of assistive devices. Students must be able to observe patients accurately, at a distance and close at hand.They must be able to observe and appreciate verbaland nonverbal communications when performingdental operations or administering medications. All students in the School of Dentistry must pos- sess adequate visual and tactile skills to perform den-tal examinations and provide treatment. Visual acuity,accommodation, and color vision are necessary to dis-cern differences and variations in color, shape, andgeneral appearance between normal and abnormalhard and soft tissues. Touch and somatic sensation arerequired for effective learning, as well as for effectiveevaluation and treatment of patients. A student mustalso possess sufficient visual acuity to read charts,records, small print, and handwritten notations. Communication Students in the School of Dentistry must be flu- ent in the use of standard written and spokenEnglish. Thus students' communication withpatients, faculty, and staff will be facilitated wheneliciting or providing information; or when docu-menting changes in patients' mood, activity, and/orposture. Students must also be skilled in observingand understanding nonverbal communication. Inaddition, they must develop the professional judg-ment that will enable them to discern when and howto maintain patient confidentiality. Motor skills School of Dentistry students should have suffi- cient motor and sensory capability in both hands to be able to provide general dental care. They mustpossess the motor and sensory capabilities to per-form diagnostic procedures\u2014including such diag-nostic maneuvers as palpation, percussion, and aus-cultation; and to perform basic laboratory tests.Exercising these capabilities requires coordinationboth of gross and fine muscular movements, equilib-rium, and functional tactile and visual senses. Students must be able to operate foot controls, utilizing fine movements; and to operate high- orlow-speed dental instruments, accurately performingmovements of less than one-half millimeter. Theymust also demonstrate well-developed tactile senseand precise control while using dental hand instru-ments. Students must be able to perform basic life-sup- port (e.g., CPR), transfer and position disabledpatients, and physically restrain patients who lackmotor control. Additionally, they must be able toposition or reposition themselves around the patientand dental chair while sitting or standing. Behavioral and social attributes Students must possess the emotional stability and resilience required for full utilization of their abilities in the context of a full and challenging edu-cation program. Success in the educational programrequires use of good judgment; prompt completion ofall responsibilities attendant to the diagnosis andcare of patients; and development of mature, sensi-tive, and effective relationships with patients. It is also imperative that students be able to tol- erate physically taxing workloads and to functioneffectively under stress. Students must be able toadapt to changing environments, to display flexibili-ty, and to learn to function in the face of uncertain-ties inherent in the clinical problems of manypatients. Compassion, integrity, honesty, concern forothers, interpersonal skills, interest, cultural sensi-tivity, and motivation are all personal qualities thatwill be assessed during the admissions and educationprocess. Disabled applicants and students It is Loma Linda University's policy to comply fully with the provisions of The Americans with Disabilities Act [42 U.S.C. Sec. 12131 (2) (1990)].The School is committed to providing dental educa-tion, including support services and reasonableaccommodations for disabilities, to qualified appli-cants who will be able to perform all technical stan-dards with or without accommodations; and forwhom such accommodation does not fundamentallyalter the School of Dentistry courses or create anundue burden. During the application process, the School requests that an applicant disclose any disability forwhich an accommodation may be needed. TheAdmissions Committee requires written documenta-tion of the disability, which they will review prior tomaking an assessment as to whether or not theapplicant can be expected to perform the essentialfunctions of the program. A student who desires accommodation for any disability identified after admission must complete arequest form available in the Office of the AssociateDean for Student Affairs for evaluation with appro-priate University entities. Appropriate and reason-able accommodation will be provided, as necessary. INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS International applicants (non-U.S. citizens andnon-U.S. permanent residents) must meet all admissions requirements for the chosen program,provide suitable recommendations, meet minimumpre-entrance examination requirements, furnishEnglish evaluations of all official foreign transcriptsand credentials, and give evidence of their ability tomeet estimated living expenses and all financialobligations to the University during their program. English competency requirements Prior to admission and regardless of nationality or citizenship, an applicant whose native language is not English is required to pass either the MichiganTest of English Language Proficiency (MTELP) or thethree ETS examinations: Test of English as a ForeignLanguage (TOEFL), Test of Spoken English (TSE),and Test of Written English (TWE). If satisfactoryresults are not achieved on the tests, remedialcourse work should be taken and the appropriatetest repeated until a satisfactory score is achieved. Apersonal interview is also encouraged to verifyacceptable verbal and written skills. The minimum MTELP requirements are as fol- lows: undergraduate, a score at the 90th percentile;graduate humanities and social sciences, 90th per-centile; graduate science, 85th percentile; profes-sional graduate, 90th percentile. 32 OF DENTISTRYThe minimum TOEFL requirements are as fol- lows: for clinical programs, a minimum score of 550 on the paper-based examination or 213 on the com-puter-based examination. For non-clinical programs,a minimum score of 173 on the computer-basedexamination is required, with the goal of a 213 scoreby graduation. It is recommended that applicantswith scores below these minimums complete anEnglish-as-a-second-language (ESL) program andrepeat the examination until a satisfactory score isachieved. The Admissions Office of the School of Dentistry reserves the right to waive or to require any or all ofthe above English competency examinations. Pre-entrance examination results Official pre-entrance examination results, as required by each program (e.g., TOEFL), should besent directly to the Admissions Office of the Schoolof Dentistry. Foreign transcripts and credentials Official foreign degrees, professional credentials, and educational transcripts (or grade sheets or grade reports) must be sent to an evaluation centerapproved by the National Association of CredentialEvaluation Services, Inc. The center reports theevaluation results directly to the Admissions Officeof the School of Dentistry. Finances and employment Loma Linda University requires accepted inter- national applicants to pay an advance international student deposit. This deposit is refundable, less anycourier/mailing fees, under the following circum-stances: 1) during the student's last quarter of enroll-ment at Loma Linda University, 2) when a visa isdenied by a U.S. embassy or consulate, or 3) when astudent terminates his/her program. United States immigration regulations require a prospective student to document his/her financialresources for tuition, fees, and living expenses. Forinternational students, on-campus employment isallowed but limited by visa regulations (e.g., for F-1and J-1 students, employment is limited to a maxi-mum of twenty hours per week while school is insession). Scholarships, assistantships, and livingstipends are rarely available at Loma LindaUniversity because it is a small, private university(i.e., not supported by the U.S. or California stategovernment but rather is church sponsored).Employment plans require approval by a designatedschool official (DSO) in International StudentServices. VISAS F-1 student visas Loma Linda University is authorized by the United States Department of Homeland Security toissue F-visa applications (i.e., I-20 forms). The F-1student visa is the visa of choice for most interna-tional students coming to Loma Linda University.This visa allows some nondegree study (e.g., and English-as-a-second-lan-guage studies). Degree-earning students are subjectto study-load requirements and are allowed limitedon-campus employment. The I-20 is issued after astudent has been accepted into a program, has paidthe advance deposit, and has documented his/herfinancial plan for the chosen program. ContactInternational Student Services at 909\\558-4955 forfurther information on F-1 student visas and the gov-erning regulations. J-exchange-visitors visas Loma Linda University has an Exchange Visitor Program which is approved by the U.S. Department of State. This J-visa exchange program is authorizedto sponsor degree-earning students, nondegree (con-tinuing education) short-term scholars, visiting pro-fessors, and research scholars. The J-visa form, DS-2019, is issued after an exchange visitor has beenaccepted into a program, scholar position, or profes-sor position; and has documented his/her financialplan (including health insurance for J-1 and for J-2dependents) for the chosen program. Loma Linda University also hosts exchange visi- tors who are sponsored by other organizations (e.g.,Fulbright scholars). As a hosting institution, LomaLinda University has limited authority over anexchange visitor since the authority resides in thesponsoring organization. Under current exchange-visitor regulations, J-2 dependents are allowed to enroll part or full time atLoma Linda University. Also, their credits earnedcan be either degree or nondegree applicable. J-1 exchange visitors are allowed to work; but employment guidelines differ, depending on theexchange category. Contact International StudentServices at 909\\558-4955 for further informationand regulations governing the Exchange VisitorProgram. Other visas Internationals may enter the U.S. on a wide variety of visas. However, a visa may have to be changed before a student can commence academicstudies at this University. Please contactInternational Student Services at 909\\558-4955 forfurther information regarding regulations and studyoptions for specific visa types. Transfer students International students currently attending other schools in the United States who have either an I-20 or a DS-2019 and who wish to attend Loma LindaUniversity must do a school-to-school transfer. Thetiming of a transfer is critical in order to maintainvisa status; therefore, it is important to consult withan international adviser as soon as the acceptanceletter is received. Study load Both the F- and J-student-visa regulations require the successful completion of a full study load during each quarter of each academic year (as defined byeach program). A minimum of 12 units per quarter isusually considered full time for an undergraduate pro-gram; 8 units per quarter is considered full time for agraduate program. In any quarter a reduced study loadrequires the prior approval of an individual inInternational Student Services who carries the title ofdesignated school official (DSO).ADMISSIONS INFORMATION 3334 SCHOOL OF DENTISTRY GENERAL PRACTICES Advance payment/Refunds For students whose loans are pending (Stafford, HEAL, CLAS, or other) at the time of registration, and which were not applied for atleast thirty days prior to registration, a $50 late-payment fee will be charged.

PROCEDURES FOR ACADEMIC REVIEW There are six Academic Review Committees: D1,D2, D3, D4, IDP, and Dental Hygiene. Membership of each committee consists of theassociate dean for academic affairs, the associatedean for student affairs, the assistant dean foradmissions, the director of admissions, and thecourse directors of all courses required of therespective class in the academic year. The associatedean for clinic administration and primary attend-ing faculty are members of the D3/D4 AcademicReview Committee. In addition, each committeehas two student members appointed by the dean inconsultation with the DSA officers. Student com-mittee members will be in the class one year aheadof the class being reviewed. The Academic Review Committees meet once per quarter to evaluate the records of student acade-mic and clinical performance and progress. Studentswhose performance does not meet the stated acade-mic standards and students who are being consid-ered for discontinuation may be scheduled for ahearing with the committee. The committee alsorecommends to the dean all appropriate candidatesfor promotion, academic probation, repeat, or otherappropriate actions; as well as students who shouldreceive special recognition for academic excellence. The process for evaluation of academic per- formance is as follows: 1. The Academic Review Committee\u2014by review- ing grades, reports, and other pertinent informa-tion\u2014identifies students whose academic and/orclinical performance is below acceptable levels. 2. The associate dean for academic affairs notifies a student facing possible academic sanctionsregarding the time and place for a meetingcalled for the purpose of allowing the student toappear before the committee to present reasonswhy action should not be taken. The AcademicReview Committee considers the student's pre-sentation and all available information beforemaking a recommendation. 3. The dean may enforce one or more of four acad- emic sanction options: Academic probation Remedial action Academic leave of absence Please refer to the respective sections thatfollow for more specific descriptions regard-ing each academic sanction. 4. Grievances of Academic Review Committee decisions may be appealed to the dean. Thedean will review the matter and either render adecision or appoint a three-member ad hoccommittee. Members of this committee will nothave been involved in the Academic ReviewCommittee decision process. The ad hoc com-mittee will make a determination as to whetherthe process was appropriately followed andwhether the record supports the decision. Theywill report their findings and recommendationsto the dean, who will make a final and bindingdecision. The dean will decide if the appealingstudent will be permitted to continue participat-ing in classes and/or clinical assignments duringthe grievance proceedings.L O M A L I N D A U N I V E R S I T Y 47 ACADEMIC DISCIPLINARY POLICY Academic probation Academic probation is a specified period of time during which the student is given an oppor- tunity to comply with specific academic stan-dards. Such action must be confirmed by memo-randum to the student. Criteria for placement on academic probation A student will be placed on academic probation, if s/he meets one or more of the following conditions: 1. Term G.P.A. below 2.0. 2. Failing (F/U) or unsatisfactory (D+/D) grades in any course required for the degree. 3. Clinical performance below minimum expect- ed for current academic level. 4. Social/behavioral/ethical problems that signif- icantly impact academic and/or clinical per- formance. Level of academic probation The level of academic probation indicates the seriousness of the cumulative academic deficien-cy. However, depending on the seriousness ornature of the academic deficiency, a student maybe considered for academic leave of absence ordiscontinuation at any level of probation. Level 1 First term on academic probation. Level 2 Second term on academic probation, consecutive or nonconsecutive. Level 2 EXCEPTION: Continued academic probation due to failing grade in acourse that cannot be repeated until alater term. Level 3 Third term on academic probation, consecutive or nonconsecutive. If astudent is unable to remove academicprobationary status within the follow-ing term, s/he will be considered foracademic discontinuation. Level 3 EXCEPTION: Continued academicprobation due to failing grade in acourse that cannot be repeated untila later term. Level 4 If a student meets criteria for academic probation for a fourth term, consecutiveor nonconsecutive, s/he will be consid-ered for academic discontinuation. Conditions/Prohibitions for a student on academ-ic probation A student on academic probation: 1. May not serve as an officer for any class, school, or extracurricular organization. 2. May not take any elective courses. 3. May not participate in any elective off-cam- pus service learning or mission activities. 4. Remains on academic probation until all the terms of the probation sanctions have been ful- filled, unless the student is discontinued.Remedial action As a condition for continued enrollment, remedial action may consist of: 1. Counseling, tutoring, repeated or additional assignments, repeated or additional course work,possibly including repeating an academicyear or portion thereof. 2. Other specified activities. Academic leave of absence Academic leave of absence is a specified period of time during which the student is withdrawn fromthe academic program. Upon request to andapproval by the Academic Review Committee, thestudent may return to the program at a year/termlevel specified by the committee. The student maybe requested to fulfill specific requirements prior toreentering the academic program. Guidelines for placement on academic leave of absence The following are guidelines for selection of academic leave of absence as the academic sanc-tion deemed best to aid the student in ultimatelybecoming a competent dentist or dental hygienist.Academic leave of absence may be considered fora student who is in one or more of the followingsituations: Student has a serious academic deficit that can- not be removed while continuing with currentcourse work. At the end of the academic year, student does not meet the criteria for promotion to the nextacademic year. Student has three consecutive quarters on acad- emic probation. Student has not passed the National Board Examination on schedule after two attemptsand requires full study time to prepare for theNational Board Examination. Student fulfills criteria for academic discontinu- ation yet shows promise for future successdespite current deficiencies. Return from an academic leave of absence requires that the student reapply for admission by written request to the associate dean for academicaffairs. The student must meet the requirements forreadmission specified by the Academic ReviewCommittee at the time the leave of absence wasgranted. The requirements for readmission may alsobe reviewed by the Academic Review Committee. Academic discontinuation Guidelines for academic discontinuation are as follows: D1 Year Any term with one or more failing grades, regardless of term or cumulative G.P.A. Three or more unsatisfactory or failing grades within the academic year, regardless of term or cumulative G.P.A. Three consecutive quarters on academic proba- tion. Failure to fulfill terms of academic probation within the specified time period. Failure to meet criteria for promotion to D2 year by the end of the D1 year.

In some situations the Academic Review Committee may recommend that a student repeatan academic year (or portion thereof) as an alterna- tive to discontinuation. RETURNING FROM ACADEMIC LEAVE OF ABSENCE Astudent who is required to repeat an entire acad- emic year or portion thereof because of academ- ic difficulties must use the following guidelines whenregistering: 1. The repeating student must be registered for all courses for the term being repeated. 2. The student may withdraw from courses only upon the approval of the course director andthe associate dean for academic affairs. PERSONAL LEAVE OF ABSENCE Aleave of absence may be for as short as one dayand is defined as being away from school for a nonillness-related obligation, which may or may notbe School sponsored. The appropriate PersonalLeave of Absence form, requiring instructor andadministrator signatures, must be obtained from theSchool of Dentistry Office of Student Affairs and becompleted prior to departure. RE-ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS Astudent who wishes to return from academic orother leave of absence must first submit a letter to the associate dean for academic affairs requestingreadmission to the program. The request will bereviewed by the School of Dentistry AcademicReview Committee in consultation with other com-mittees or administrators, as needed. The studentwill be contacted by the associate dean for academicaffairs with the decision of the committee. If therequest for readmission is approved, the studentmust complete a Re-entry Form, available at theOffice of Academic Affairs. STUDENT-INITIATED ACADEMIC GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE If a student wishes to contest a grade, s/he should discuss the grade first with the instructor, where appropriate; then with the course director, if applica-ble; and finally with the department chair. If the stu-dent is not satisfied, s/he may then appeal to theassociate dean for academic affairs. APPEAL PROCESS If a student wishes to appeal a suspension or dis-continuation, appeal for reinstatement may be made directly to the dean of the School of Dentistry.Final appeal may be made to the chancellor of theUniversity. In the case of an appeal to the chancellorof the University, action taken will be limited toeither denial of the appeal or a referral back to theSchool of Dentistry for further consideration. Such48 SCHOOL OF DENTISTRYappeals are not expected to be routine and should be considered only in circumstances where new andrelevant information exists that was not available forconsideration by the Academic Review Committee. ACADEMIC DISHONESTY The academically dishonest act intentionally vio-lates the community of trust upon which all learning is based, and intentionally compromises theorderly transfer of knowledge from teacher to stu-dent. Examples of academic dishonesty include but are not limited to: a. copying from another student's paper during examinations or quizzes; b. using unauthorized aids during examinations or quizzes; c. looking at another individual's examination or quiz in a way that appears that information isbeing sought; d. communicating with another student during examinations or quizzes; e. loud and disruptive behavior during lectures, demonstrations, or examinations; f. plagiarism or excessive paraphrasing of some- one else's work in a written assignment; g. falsifying or changing of grades or other acade- mic records; and/or h. excessive unexcused absences from classes or from clinical assignments.When allegations of misconduct are made, the instructor should confront the accused student todetermine whether or not some reasonable explana-tion exists. If no satisfactory explanation exists, theallegation must be reported to the associate dean forstudent affairs, who will initiate procedures as out-lined in the School of Dentistry section of theUniversity Student Handbook 2002. Each student is responsible for reporting ethical misconduct to aninstructor or directly to the associate dean for stu-dent affairs. TRANSCRIPTS The Office of University Records provides tran-scripts to other institutions or to the student or graduate only upon the written request of the stu-dent or graduate. Communications such as tran-scripts, statements of completion, diplomas, and cer-tificates are issued only for those whose financialobligation to the University has been met. SPECIFIC PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS Information on the preceding pages pertains to gen-eral requirements governing all students. The stu- dent is reminded of individual responsibility to befully informed not only of these general require-ments but also of the specific requirements in thefollowing pages, which govern the curriculum of thechosen program.ACADEMIC PRACTICES 49 ACADEMIC PRACTICES 49III SERVICE LEARNING50 SCHOOL OF DENTISTRYService Learning Service Learning is a program at Loma Linda University School of Dentistry that continues the original purpose of the School to train dental health professionals toprovide service to the underserved, both locally and abroad. Field experience for students of dentistry and dental hygiene include extramural mission experience within the U.S. and in several foreign countries, local health fairs, andelementary school dental health presentations. These service opportunities may lastfrom one day to several weeks. During the four-year program, each dental and dental hygiene student is required to complete assigned service learning rotations. Students are required to be in good and regular standing to be eligible to participate in elective international service-learning experiences. The student association also provides opportunities for service within the School, which include student-sponsored \"free clinics\" to underserved populations.ACADEMIC PRACTICES 51 SERVICE LEARNING 51 52 SCHOOL OF DENTISTRYIV PROGRAMS AND DEPARTMENTS Programs and Degrees Codes and Course NumbersBasic Sciences Departments AnatomyBiochemistry and MicrobiologyPhysiology and Pharmacology The Dental Hygiene ProgramThe General Dentistry ProgramThe General Dentistry Departments Dental AnesthesiologyDental Educational PRACTICES 53 PROGRAMS AND DEPARTMENTS 5354 SCHOOL OF DENTISTRY Programs and Degrees The departments of the School of Dentistry offer a comprehensive range of pro- grams. Each of the School's five programs draws on the offerings of these depart-ments. The School's undergraduate curriculum\u2014the Dental Hygiene Program\u2014prepares the dentist's assistant to enter a variety of careers. Dental hygiene is a four-year college cur-riculum; the junior and senior years are taken in the LLU School of Dentistry. The four-year General Dentistry Program equips the general dentist to meet the needs of a diverse patient population. The Combined-Degrees Programs enable the student to earn D.D.S./M.S. degrees or D.D.S./Ph.D. degrees by taking programs concurrently in the School of Dentistry and theGraduate School; or to earn D.D.S./M.P.H. degrees by taking programs concurrently in theSchool of Dentistry and the School of Public Health. The twenty-one-month International Dentist Program is designed for the dentist whose dental degree was earned outside the United States. Upon completion of the pro-gram, the student earns a D.D.S. degree from Loma Linda University. The Advanced Dental Education Programs lead to postdoctoral certificates in eight specialty and nonspecialty areas of dentistry\u2014and, at the student's option, additionally,to the Master of Science degree. PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS Sections IV, V, and VI give the setting for each program the School of Dentistryoffers.

Dental science courses, preclinical lectures and seminars, laboratory exercises, and clinical assignments have been developed to provide training inthe variety of procedures delegated to the dental hygienist within the dental practice set-ting. These experiences are sequenced in an organized manner that provides for continualgrowth and competency in performance of all traditional and expanded-function proce-dures. The purpose of the program is to develop professionals prepared for the currentpractice of dental hygiene, as well as graduates who are additionally prepared to deal withfuture changes in dentistry. Courses that encourage analytical thinking and problem-solvingtechniques and that enhance the ability to evaluate the latest in research are importantadjuncts to clinical training. Upon completion of this curriculum, graduates will be pre-pared to enter a variety of career options available to a dental hygienist. FACULTY DENTAL HYGIENE PROGRAM 61 DENTAL HYGIENE CURRICULUM BACHELOR OF SCIENCE Dental hygiene, a profession dating back to 1913, is largely concerned with preventive health services. The hygienist works in associationwith the dentist in private-practice offices, indus-trial organizations, schools, hospitals, state or fed-eral public health services, and the armed forces.Salary ranges compare with those for registerednurses. The curriculum is organized as a four-year college program leading to the Bachelor of Sciencedegree. The freshman and sophomore year's pre-entrance study may be taken at any accreditedcollege. The professional program begins with thejunior year in the School of Dentistry. The pro-gram is approved by the Commission on DentalAccreditation of the American Dental Association.The first class at this University graduated in 1961. Philosophy A profession in the health arts and sciences calls increasingly for persons of intelligence, integ- rity, industry, responsibility, and depth of humanunderstanding. Therefore, the program of instructionis planned on a strong liberal arts foundation. Thestudent is encouraged to take electives that con-tribute to breadth of knowledge and quality of val-ues. The choice of electives in early college work isimportant for many reasons. The School of Dentistry is interested in appli- cants with the potential to become hygienists whoare well-read and gracious persons\u2014prepared tocommunicate effectively in professional and commu-nity relationships. They should be able to draw onknowledge of the structure and function of thehuman body in health and disease, applyingresources based on Christian ideals and values to aidin the solution of personal problems. They shouldalso be able to develop the attitudes and skills thatwill most effectively serve society. Goal The goal of the Dental Hygiene Program is to educate competent, concerned, and active members of the dental hygiene profession who possess theability to effectively perform the expanding scope ofpractice of the dental hygienist. Loma Linda University emphasizes Christian values and beliefs and the concept of whole-personcare. Opportunities for spiritual growth and fellow-ship among faculty and students are interwoven intodaily academic pursuits, clinical practice, and socialinteractions. The advancement of dental hygiene depends on an ever-growing body of knowledge. Therefore, thisprogram also places great importance on providingan atmosphere in which students can develop theskills necessary to objectively assess new theoriesand trends in dentistry, in light of scientific knowl-edge and principles. By combining Christian valueswith an appreciation for research and the scientificmethod, graduates will continually apply sound prin-ciples to patient care and exhibit God's love in thequality of service they render. Admission The student must have a diploma or its equiva- lent from a four-year secondary school, and must meet college-entrance requirements. After successfulcompletion of the prescribed pre-entrance coursework in an accredited college or university, admissionto the Dental Hygiene Program is in the junior year. For entrance to the junior professional year, the applicant must have: 96 quarter or 64 semester units of acceptable college credit.

The School of Dentistry is committed to: Beginning the curriculum with a strong foun- dation in the sciences that are basic to knowl-edge of the structure and function of thehuman being in health and in sickness. Providing an educational environment that progressively leads a student to mastery andcorrelation of clinical sciences and skills. Developing a frame of reference from which to mobilize the resources of dentists andassociated professional personnel in bothdelivery of health care and contribution tocommunity well-being by education for theprevention of illness. These concepts include responsibility for contributing to the body of scientific knowledge by questioning, investigating, and teaching; forremaining sensitive and adaptive to the needs ofhumanity in ever-changing conditions; and formaintaining consciousness of the individual oblig-ation to live, practice, and strive for the good ofhumanity. The curriculum in dentistry, organized to be completed in four academic years, fulfills require-ments for the Doctor of Dental Surgery degree. Objective The primary objective of the dental curricu- lum is to graduate men and women who attest to the purpose of the University and the goals of theSchool of Dentistry, which include advancingknowledge and understanding of health, disease,and ways to improve health and the dental healthcare-delivery system through basic and appliedresearch. Admission standards Before starting the first (D1) year, the appli- cant must have completed a minimum of three academic years and no fewer than 96 semester or144 quarter units in a college accredited by aregional accrediting association. Acceptance iscontingent on completion of specified subjectrequirements. A four-year undergraduate curricu-lum leading to a bachelor's degree is highly recom-mended. A student having completed such adegree is given preference for admission to thedental program. As a rule, credits earned in professional schools (business, medical technology, nursing,veterinary medicine, pharmacy, or medicine) donot fulfill admission requirements. Loma Linda University School of Dentistry insists that all dental students must possess thecapabilities required to complete the full curricu-lum in the allotted time and to achieve the levelsof competence required by the faculty. In broadterms, the following are standards required foradmission: Intellectual capability to complete the cur- riculum. Emotional adaptability and stability. Social and perceptual skills. Physical ability to carry out activities in observations and communications, and the possession of sufficient motor and sensoryabilities to practice general dentistry. For admission, the applicant must meet spe- cific criteria related to past academic performance (G.P.A.), performance on the Dental AdmissionTest, and analysis of a personal profile interview.The weight given to these admission factors isapproximately equal. Students who are enrolled in a graduate pro- gram in the University are not considered foradmission until they have completed or have beenreleased from the graduate program. Credits for college work should show a mini- mum grade-point average of 2.7 in science sub-jects and in nonscience subjects, averaged sepa-rately. The student must have a grade of C orabove for all required pre-entrance course work. Prior to consideration for admission, the applicant is required to have taken the test rec-ommended by the American Dental Association.The student entering the first (D1) year is expect-ed to have taken the test within the past twoyears, preferably not later than October of theyear preceding admission. At the applicant'srequest, test results are sent to the School by thetesting service. Information may be obtaineddirectly from the American Dental Association,THE GENERAL DENTISTRY PROGRAM 69 The General Dentistry Program The goal of the General Dentistry Program is to train practitioners in the delivery of high-quality dental care that is preventive in purpose and comprehensive inscope, and that is based on sound biological principles.70 SCHOOL OF DENTISTRY 211 East Chicago Avenue, Chicago, IL 60611. Or an application form and descriptive material maybe obtained from the School of Dentistry. Physical requirements A technical standards policy defines special physical requirements for students entering the School. This policy is outlined in section II of this BULLETIN under Admissions Information and is available in the School of Dentistry Office ofStudent Affairs. Background The subjects listed as required form the mini- mum background for professional study. The stu- dent should avoid duplicating science courses thatare offered in the professional curriculum andshould plan a college program in keeping withindividual interests and abilities. The student'spurpose should be the pursuit of diverse knowl-edge, the cultivation of an inquiring mind, thepractice of efficient methods of study, and thehabit of thinking and reasoning independently.These are of paramount importance to the stu-dent's development as a unique and responsiblehuman being. The choice of electives can broaden the stu- dent's view of the scope of knowledge. Being wellread will give a perspective on the sweep of humanthought throughout the ages, and often this will be ofassistance in written and verbal communication andwill improve the ability to think and express oneselfwell. Psychological, social, philosophical, and reli-gious insights will help to develop basic resources forthe solution of personal problems and the growth ofthat self-understanding the student must first haveto understand and help associates. PRE-ENTRY REQUIREMENTS Although a three-year predentistry curriculumin an accredited college is prescribed for acceptance, a baccalaureate degree, or the equiva-lent, is advantageous. The following complete col-lege courses are required for entrance into theD.D.S. degree program: HUMANITIES Freshman English (complete sequence). NATURAL SCIENCES (complete course, one full year or equiva-lent) General biology or Zoology with laboratory. General chemistry with laboratory.General physics with laboratory.Organic chemistry with laboratory. ELECTIVES Strongly recommended: Ceramics. Principles of management.Basic accounting.Mathematics.Basic human nutrition.Anatomy.Histology.Biochemistry.Psychology. The minimum of 96 semester or 144 quarter units may be completed from fields that con- tribute to a broad educational background. Employment Because of the heavy class load, first-year students in dentistry may not accept part-time employment during the first term, and may acceptsuch employment thereafter only upon receivingpermission from the Office of the Associate Deanfor Academic Affairs. Microscope The student may be required to have access to a satisfactory binocular compound microscope during the first three quarters of the curriculum.If a student does not have a microscope, one maybe rented from the Department of Anatomy. Allmicroscopes should meet the following criteria: 1. The microscope shall be binocular and no older than fifteen years. 2. The lenses shall be in perfect condition. 3. The equipment shall include an Abbe con- denser with rack and pinion adjustment, an iris diaphragm, and a mechanical stage. 4. The lens equipment shall include a scanning objective 2.5 or 3x, 16mm objective, 4mmobjective, oil-immersion objective, and 10xeyepiece. If it is necessary for the student to rent a University microscope, the type available will depend on the rental demand and departmentalpolicy. Instruments, textbooks, additional materials The instruments, textbooks, and materials required for the study and practice of dentistry are prescribed by the School and issued to thestudent as needed in the progress of the curricu-lum. The student must buy from the School theinitial package outfit of instruments specified inthe official instrument list. Unauthorized orincomplete equipment is not acceptable. Advanceadministrative approval must be obtained for anyexception. NATIONAL BOARDS Successful completion of the National BoardExamination Parts I and II (NBE-I and II) is a requirement for graduation. These examinationsare designed to assess cognitive knowledge of thebasic, behavioral, and clinical sciences. Eligibilityto sit for either part of the National Board Examina-tion is determined by successful completion of the70 SCHOOL OF DENTISTRYcurriculum leading up to the examination. In addi- tion, students are required to pass a comprehensiveexamination that assesses mastery of the test speci-fications prior to each National Board Examination.The eligibility requirements and timetable for pass-ing the National Board Examination are as follows: Part I 1st attempt\u2014Scheduled in July following completion of second year. If a student fails the July examination, s/he will have her/his scheduledclinic time substantially reduced. During thistime, students will be required to study for a re-examination in December and to attend specialreview sessions and a study-skills course. 2nd attempt\u2014If a student does not success- fully complete the second attempt of the Part IExamination, s/he will be required to take a two-quarter leave of absence to prepare for re-exami-nation the following July. 3rd attempt\u2014After taking the re-examination in July, the student will be allowed to work on theclinic until examination results are received. Ifthe student successfully completes the Part IExamination, s/he will continue to work on theclinic for the Summer and Fall Quarters and willbegin didactic courses again during the WinterQuarter with the current third-year students. Ifthe student does not successfully complete theNational Board Examination Part I on the thirdattempt, s/he will be discontinued from the pro-gram. Part II 1st attempt\u2014Scheduled in December of the fourth year. If the examination is not successfully completed, access to the clinic will be restrictedin order to provide additional time for study. Thestudent will be given an opportunity to retake theexamination in the spring. National BoardExamination policy requires subsequent attemptsto be at least ninety days apart. 2nd attempt\u2014If a student fails the second attempt of the Part II examination, s/he will beunable to participate in licensure examinations andmay be required to take a leave of absence to pre-pare for a re-examination. A candidate for theDoctor of Dental Surgery degree must have success-fully completed Parts I and II of the National BoardExamination before being awarded the degree. ACADEMIC INCENTIVE PROGRAM The School of Dentistry has an incentive systemto reward students for exceptional perfor- mance on the National Board Examinations (NBE-I and NBE -II).

CARUSO, Chair; Director, Advanced Education Program The predoctoral courses in the Department of Orthodontics, as outlined by the American Dental Association, apply the knowledge derived from the basic sciences, research, and clinical treatment to the science of orthodontics so that the dental graduate will have the background necessary to recognize those conditionss/he is capable of managing. Clinical experience ranges from minor tooth movement andearly-treatment cases to more difficult, advanced cases\u2014according to the student'sdemonstrated ability, perseverance, judgment, and interest in orthodontics. The graduatewill be able to: 1. Anticipate and detect malocclusions.2. Take steps to prevent or intercept malocclusion where possible.3. Use this knowledge as an adjunct to procedures in all other phases of dental practice. 4. Provide a basis for understanding the possibilities of orthodontic treatment.5. Treat limited orthodontic problems that fall within the general dentist's sphere of knowledge and training. 6. Know the bases on which case referrals are made and how to handle a referral correctly.
