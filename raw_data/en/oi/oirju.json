With all the harmful toxins in today's environment, no one is immune from toxin buildup. As toxicants accumulate in the body, the risk of developing health problems increases considerably. With all the detox kits on the market, it may seem like it doesn't matter how you go about toxicant removal, but it does. When done the wrong way, a detox can cause real health problems. For these reasons, it's essential to follow a method that considers your chemical makeup. Holistic detox methods do just that. With today's many conveniences and technologies, we pay for these modern lifestyle intoxicants. Toxicants come from the environment and can be man-made or naturally occurring, such as our food and water. An estimated 80,000 harmful chemicals have been released into the environment over the past 50 years. And the older you get, the longer these toxicants have to accumulate in your system. Toxin buildup can interfere with a range of bodily processes, causing any number of problems, including: Detox, also called toxicant removal, flushes harmful materials out of the body. When done right, you can expect noticeable improvements in your health. Dr. Cutler of Cutler Integrative Medicine uses natural, holistic methods for detoxing and customizes treatment to your body's unique needs. The human body is designed as a self-regulating system. Toxicants disrupt the millions of chemical processes that regulate this system. To add insult to injury, many of these toxic materials have long half-lives, meaning they can reside in your body long after you were exposed to them. Before long, health problems start to take center stage. Here are a few signs you may be due for a detox: Each person's chemical makeup differs, so a detox regimen must be able to address your body's specific toxicant removal needs. Otherwise, using a one-size-fits-all detox approach can actually cause more harm than good. Cutler Integrative Medicine uses holistic detox methods based on a \"whole\" person treatment approach. Dr. Cutler works with a broad spectrum of detox therapies, including: At Cutler Integrative Medicine, your treatment plan will not only be based on your body's needs, but also your mental, emotional, and spiritual condition.
