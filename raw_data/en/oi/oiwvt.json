{"title": "A Severe Disc Herniation Mimics Spinal Tumor", "author": "Eric Chun-Pu Chu; Andy Lin; Kevin Hsu Kai Huang; Gordon Cheung; Wai Ting Lee; Andy Fu Chieh Lin", "url": null, "hostname": null, "description": "Lumbar disc herniation (LDH) is prevalent among adults aged 25-55 years who spend a considerable proportion of their time sitting or standing with heavy workloads. We report the case of a 33-year-old male waiter with severe LDH, causing compression of the nerve roots and spinal cord with neurological dysfunction, who presented to a chiropractic clinic. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a radiological differential diagnosis comprising LDH and an epidural mass lesion. To rule out serious pathology, a second MRI with contrast was ordered, which confirmed the diagnosis of severe LDH. Diagnosing large LDH may be challenging, and severe disc herniation often mimics spinal tumors. This study offers insights into the differential diagnosis of LDH and spinal tumors, as well as the design of a treatment strategy for severe LDH in the chiropractic clinic.", "sitename": "Cureus", "date": "2023-03-22", "cleaned_text": "On May 25, 2018, the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) went into effect and changed how organizations deal with personal data of customers located in the EU.
