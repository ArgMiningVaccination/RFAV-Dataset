Backgrou nd The threat or use of C B weapons is a possible condition of future warfare and could occur in the early stages of war to disrupt Uni ted States (US) operatio ns and logistics. In many of the regions where the US is lik ely to deploy forces, potential adversaries may use CB weapon s. Potential adversaries may s eek to counter US conventional military superiority using less expensive and more atta inable, asy mmetrical means. To meet this challenge, US forces m ust be properly train ed and equipped to operate effectively and decisively in the face of NBC at tacks.1 Additi onally, US forces could be confronted in an environment where TIC present a hazard to US forces.2 a. Use of CB Weapons.3 Adversaries may employ CB agen ts and other toxic materials to achieve specific effects. In ad dition to the physical effects, there exist psychologic al effects, both in the immediate ta rget area and in othe r vulnerable areas that may be potential target s. (1) Chemical agents have effects that can be immediate or delayed, can be persistent or nonpersistent, and ca n have signif icant phys iological eff ects. While relatively large quantities of an a gent are required to en sure an area remains contaminated over time, small- scale sel ective use that exploits su rprise can cause signific ant disrupti on and may have lethal effects. (2) Biological a gents can produce le thal or incapacitating effects over an extensive area and can reproduce. The delayed onset of s ymptoms and detection, identification, and verification difficulties for biological ag ents can also confer im portant advantages to adversari es who deci de to use biological agents. (3) The means available to adversarie s for delivery of CB weapons range from specially designed, sophisticated weapon sy stems developed by nati ons to relatively inefficient i mprovised devices employed by terrorists and other disaffected individuals and groups. b. US Policy.3 This paragraph contai ns brief des criptions of treaty, lega l, and policy strictures on chemical and biological warfare (CBW ). (1) The Protocol for the Pro hibition of the Use in War of Asphy xiating, Poisonous or Oth er Gases, and of B acteriologic al Methods of Warfa re,\" also known as the Geneva Pro tocol of 1925 , prohibits chemical and bacteriological methods of warfare. Most parties interpret the protocol as a prohibition only of the f irst use of these agents in war. It did not ban the development, production, or stockpiling of these weapons. In 197 4, the US Senate gav e advice and consent to ratification of this protocol, subject to the reservation that the US would not be bound by the provis ions with respect to an enemy state or its allies who f ail to respec t the prohibitions of the protocol. On 22 January 1975, the US ratified the protocol subject to this r eservatio n. The protocol entered into force for the US on 10 April 1975. The relevance of the Geneva Protocol is largely superseded by the more I-1 restrictive Convention on the Proh ibition of the Dev elopm ent, Production, Stockpiling, and Use of Che mical Weap ons and on their Destruction (also k nown as the Chemical Wea pons Convention [CWC] and by the Convention on the Prohibitio n of Bacteriological and Toxic Weapons (also k nown as the Biological Weapo ns Convention [BWC]) summarized below. (2) The Presid ential S tatement on Ch emical and Biological Weapons, 25 November 1969, renoun ced the US use of lethal biological agents and weapons and confined biological research to defensive mea sures su ch as immunization and safety. Und er the terms of the BWC, parti es undertake not to develo p, produce, stock pile, or acquire biological agents or toxins \"of types and in q uantities that have no justification for prophyl actic, protective and other peaceful purposes,\" as well as weapons and means of delivery. The BWC does not establish a specific verificati on regime. The US ratified the BWC on 29 March 1975. (3) Executive Order No. 11850, 8 April 1975, Renunciation of Certain Uses in War of Ch emical Herbi cides and R iot Control Agents , ren ounced first use of herbicides in war (excep t for specified defensive uses) and fi rst use of RCAs in war except for d efensive military modes to save lives. (4) The CWC, which entered into force on 29 April 1997, ban s the development, production, acquisition, stockpiling, transfer, or use of chemical weapons. It provides for the destruction of all c hemical weapons stocks within 10 years after entry into force. It contains a vigorous challenge regime to ensure compliance. The US ratified the CWC on 25 April 1997. 2. Threat a. Changes.4 Countries with chemical weapons programs are adding agents and more sophis ticated delivery systems. Similarl y, the sophistication of CBW capabilities is increasing. Proliferation of weapons techno logy, precision navigation technology, and CBW technology in developin g nations presents th e US with a complicated national sec urity challenge. Intelligence efforts include co llecti on and anal ysis of nations' dual-use, CB industrial capabilities, and development of th e indications and warning of adversarial use of dual-use capabilities. b. Challenges. The US fa ces a number of region al proliferation challen ges. Many of these are detailed in the January 2001 report published by the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD), Proliferation: Th reat and Response . At least 25 countries now possess\u2014or are in the process of acquiring and developi ng\u2014capabilities to inflict mass casualties and destruction: NBC weapons or the means to deliver them.5 c. Proliferation.4 Proliferation of CBW technolo gy also raises several important issues. Var ious nation s could export a wide array of chemical products, including Australian group-controlled items to numerous countries of proliferation concern. The controlled items include specific chemical ag ent precursors, pathogens with biological warfare (BW) applications, and dual-use eq uipment that can be used in both CBW programs. d. Increases in Proliferation.4 In the next several years, the threat from the proliferation of CBW may increase. This coul d result from the development of CB agents that are more difficult t o detect and from the adoption of more capable delivery s ystems. States with existing programs may master th e production processes fo r complete weapons developmen t and will be less depen dent on outside suppliers. I-2 (1) Any nation with the political will and a minimal industrial base could produce CBW agents suitable for use in warfare. Efficient weaponization of these agents, however, does require d esign and production skills usuall y found in countries that possess a munitions d evelopment infrastructure or access to such skills from cooperative sources. (2) On the other hand, almost any natio n or group could fabricate crude agent dispersal devices. Such weapons might be ca pable of inf licting only limited numbers of casualties; nevertheless, they could have sign ificant operational repercussions due to the psychologic al impact cr eated by fears of CBW agent exposure.4 (3) Genetic engineering gives BW develo pers the tools to pursue agents that could defeat the protective and treatment proto cols of the p rospective adversary. Genetically engineered microorganisms also ra ise the technological hurdle that must be overcome to provide for effective detection, identification, and early warning of BW attacks. (4) Numerous characteristi cs need to be controlled for a hi ghly effective BW agent. Historically, the accentuati on of one c haracteristic often resulted in the attenuation of one or m ore other characteristics, possibly even rendering the modified agent ineffective as a weapon. Advance s in biotech nology, gene tic engineering, and re lated scientific fields provide ever-increasing potential to control more of these factors, possibly leading to an enhanced ability to use BW agents as battlefield weapons. e. Novel BW Agents.1 Advances in biotechnology and gene tic engineering may facilitate the developm ent of poten tially new and more deadly BW agents. The a bility to modify microbial agents at a molec ular leve l has existed since the 1960s, when new genetic engineering techniques were introd uced, but the enterprise tended to be slow and unpredictab le. With today's techni ques, infe ctious organi sms can be modified to bring about disea se in different ways. The current level of sophistication for many biological agents is lo w, but there is en ormo us potent ial\u2014based on advances in modern molecular biology, fermentation, and drug de livery techn ology\u2014for making more sophisticated weapons. The BW agents may emerge in two lik ely catego ries: man-m ade manipulations of classic BW agents and newly discovered or em erging infectious diseas es. An example of a recent new pathogen (though not necessarily ideal BW agents) includes streptococcus pneumonia S23F, a naturally occurring strain of pneumon ia resistant to at least six of the more commonly used antibiotics. (1) The potential types of novel biol ogical agents that could be produced through ge netic engineering methodologies ar e listed be low. Each of these techniques se eks to capitalize on the extreme lethality, virulenc e, or infectivity of BW agents and exploit this potential by developing methods to deliver more efficiently and to control these agents on the battlefield. (a) Benign microorganisms geneticall y altered to produce a toxin, venom , or bioregula tor. (b) Microorganisms resista nt to antibiotics, standard vaccines, and therapeutics. (c) Microorganisms with enhanced aerosol and environmental stability. (d) Immunologically altered microorga nisms able to defeat standard identification, detection, and diagnostic methods. (e) Combinations of the ab ove four types with improved delivery systems. I-3 (2) The future lik elihood of infectiou s agents being created fo r BW purpo ses will be influ enced by technological trends such as\u2014 (a) Genetically engineered vectors in the form of modified inf ectious organisms may become increasingly available as medical tools and techniques become more widely available. (b) Strides will be made in the understanding of infectious disease mechanisms and in microbial genetics that are responsible for diseas e processes. (c) An increased understa nding of the human immune system function and disease mechanism s will shed l ight on the circumstances that cause individual susceptibility to infecti ous disease. (d) Vaccines and antidotes will be improved over the long term, perhaps to the point where classic BW agents will offe r less utilit y as a means of causing casualties. (e) Many bioen gineering companies (b oth US and foreign) now sell all-in - one kits to enable res earchers to perform recombinant deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) experiments. The availability of free onl ine gene sequence databases and analytic software over the Internet further amplifies and dissem inates this capability. It is now possible to transform relatively benign organi sms to cause harmful effects. 3. Militarily Significant Aspect s of Toxic Chemical Agents a. Classification. A toxic chemical ag ent is any chemical which, through its chemical action on lif e processes, can cause death, temporary incapacitation, or permanent harm to humans or animals.6 For the purpose of this man ual, chemical agents are further divided into chemical warfare (CW) agents and military chemical com pounds. The terms \"persistent\" and \"nonpersistent\" describe the time chemical agents remain in an area and do not classify the agents technically. (1) CW Agents. The CW agents are toxic chemica ls and their precursors prohibited under the CWC. These agents include chok ing, nerve, bloo d, blister, and incapacitati ng agents. Their phys iological actions are as f ollows: (a) Choking Agents.7 Chok ing agents cause damage to the lun gs, irritation to the eyes and the respirat ory tra ct, and pulmonary edema (\"dry-land drowning\"). (b) Nerve Agents. Nerve agents i nhibit cholinesterase (ChE) enzymes. This inhibit ion permits acetylcholine (ACh), wh ich transmits many nerve impulses , to collect at its various sites of action.7 The body's muscles a nd glands become overs timulated due to excessive amoun ts of ACh. At sufficient doses, this can lead to an inability of the body to sustain breathing. (c) Blood Agents.7 The blood transports these agents to all body tissues. Hydrogen cyanide (AC) and cyanogen chloride (CK) are cel lular poison s, and they disrupt the oxidative processes used by the cells.7 Arsine (SA) is different. It causes hemolysis of the red blood cells.8 The central nervous system (CNS) is especially vulnerable to lack of oxygen rega rdless of the etiology, and respir atory and car diovascular collapse resulting from AC and CK poisoning. In the case of SA poisoning, the proximal cause of death is myocardial failure. I-4 (d) Blister Age nts (Vesicants). Blister agents are noted for producing reddening and blistering of the skin, but the eyes and respiratory tr act are more sensitive than the skin. Eye exposure result s in reddeni ng of the eyes and temporary blindness or permanent effects. Inh aled mustard damage s mucous membranes and the respiratory tract.7 (e) Incapacitati ng Agents.9 Used in a military context, incapacitation is understood to mean ina bility to perform one's m ilitary mission. Sinc e missi ons vary, for the purpose of this manual, incapacitation means t he inabil ity to perform any military task effectively. An incapaci tating agen t is an agent that prod uces temporary ph ysiological or mental effects, or both, which will render indi viduals incapable of con certed effort in the performance of their as signed duties. Medical treatment is not essent ial but can facilitate a more rapid recovery.7 (2) Military Chemical Com pounds. Military chem ical compounds are less toxic and include materials such as respiratory irritant agents, RCAs, smoke and obscurants, and incendiary materia ls. The term excludes CW agents. Their physiological actions are as follows: (a) RCAs (La crimators). The RCAs ar e chemicals that rapidl y produce i n humans sensory irrita tion or disa bling physical effects which disappear within a short time following termination of exposure.6 They are local irritants that, in very low concentrati ons, act primarily on the eyes, ca using intense pain and tearing. At high concentrati ons they irritate the respiratory tract and the skin. They sometimes cause nausea and vomiting. (b) Respiratory Irritant Ag ents. These agents were previously called vomiting agents. Their primary action is irritation of the respiratory tract.10 In addition, these agents cause lacrimation (tearing), i rritation of the eyes, uncontrollable co ughing, sneezing, n ausea, and a general feeling of bod ily discomfort. Usually symptoms disappear in 20 minutes to 2 hour s, leaving no residual injury.7 b. Duration of Effectiveness. Several fa ctors determine the time a chemical agent remains eff ective. These include, but are not limited to, the method of dissemin ation, weather and terrain co nditions, an d the physic al and chemical properties of the agent. (1) Method of Dissemination.11 Chemical agents are usually dissemina ted in the field in the form of vapors (gases), aeroso ls, or liquids . When a c hemical age nt is disseminated as a vapor from a bursting munition , initiall y the cloud expands, grows cooler and heavier, and tends to retain its form. Aerosols are fin ely divided liquid and/or solid substances suspended in the atmosphere and behave in m uch the same manner as vaporized agents. Liquid agents can be absor bed (soak ed into) and adsorbed (adhered to) by surfaces. They can then be evap orated or desorbed (off-gas) from surfaces, causing a vapor hazard. (2) Weather and Terrain Conditions.11 Many weat her factors and terrain conditions influence the duration of effecti veness of chemic al agents. Most important weather factors include temperature, temperat ure gradient, wind speed, relative humidity, and precipitation. Important terrain condit ions include vegetation, soil, and terrain contours. (3) Physical Properties. Some of th e important physical properties are vapor density, vapor pressure (VP), volatility, freez ing point (FP), and melting point (MP). Vapor I-5 density determines whether the agent is light er or heavier than air, thus determining whether the agent will settle to low areas or fl oat away and dissipate in the at mosphere. Vapor press ure is used to determine the volati lity of an agent. The volatility has an effect upon the vapor concentration. It also affects the duration of an agent hazard afte r dissemination. The boiling and freezing poin ts of chemical agents influence their operational use and the means of disseminatin g them. See Appendix A for information on table of equ ivalents and commonly used pr efixes, Appendix B for information on temperature conversions, and Appendix C for th e periodic table of el ements. See Chapter II for definitions of selecte d physical properties. (4) Chemical Properties. The chemical properties of an agen t include its stability and reactivity with wate r and other s ubstances. See Chapter II for defi nitions of selected chemical properties. c. Potency an d Physiological Actions. Factors th at contribut e to the adverse human health effects of chemical agents includ e toxicity, route of exposure (ROE ), dosage, exposure duration, minute volume (MV), temp erature, endpoint, physiological s tressors, rate of detoxification (ROD), and rate of a ction (ROA). Note that not all factors are applicable to all exposu re scenarios . For ex ample, MV is n ot applicable to a percutaneous liquid expos ure. Dosages are given for a 70-kilo gram (kg) male with an MV of 15 liters per minute (L/min). Addit ional toxicological data are required to determine if the toxicity estimates can be applied to women. Emphasis is placed on acute toxic effects. Acute toxic effects are those occurring within moments to a few days of the toxic exposure. The toxicity estimates provided are not applicable to the general population.10, 12 , 13 NOTE: Oc cupationa l health gui delines for the evaluation and control of occupatio nal expos ure to nerve and bli ster agents is promulgated separately by the US Army Surgeo n Ge nera l in DA Pamphlets 40-8 and 40-17 3. These refere nces define the medical surveilla nce program for personnel w ho support chemical demilita rization operations. d. CWC Chem icals. Appendix D contains the list of toxic chemicals, groups of chemicals, and precurs ors subject to the CWC. The examples given in Appendix D are not all-inclusiv e. There are, by conservative estimates, 25,000 or more chemicals s ubject to th e CWC regul ation\u2014listing each chemical by name is not practical.14 Chemicals covered under the C WC are divided into three categories as follows: (1) Schedule 1 chemicals (See Table D-1, page D-1 ) have little or no use in industrial and agricultural industries. They pose a high risk to the object and p urpose of the CWC by virtue of their high potential for use in activities prohibit ed under the CWC.14 (2) Schedule 2 chemicals (See Table D-2, page D-2 ) may be useful in the production of chemical weapons; however, they also have legitimate uses in other industrial areas. They pose a significant risk to the object and purpose of the CWC.14 (3) Schedule 3 chemicals (See Table D-3, page D-3 ) have legitimate uses in industrial areas and pose a risk to the object and purpose of the CWC.14 e. Dual-Use Precursors. Precursors for CW agents also have civil uses in industrial and agricul tural industries (see Ap pendix E). f. CW Agents and Other Military Chemic al Com pounds. See Appendix F for the symbols of CW agents and other military ch emical com pounds. See Appendix G for a I-6 consolidation of the information given in the ch emical agent tables and toxicity tab les in Chapters II and III. NOTE: See informati on in Cha pters II, II I, and App endix H fo r detailed informatio n on toxicity of CW agents and military c hemica l compounds. g. Agent Mixtures. Mixing chemical agents with each other or with oth er materials can alter th e characteri stics and effectivene ss of the agents. Mixtures may lower the freezing point, increasing agent effectiveness over a wider temperature range. The addition of thickeners or thinners to agents will in crease or decrease persistency: for example, soman (GD) mixed with ners will increase persistency; RCAs mixed with thi nners will decrease persistency. In addition to c hanging the physical properties, mixing agents together will create special problems through their physiological effects. These problems can produce difficulty in identification, immedi ate and delayed effects, or contact and vapor hazards occurring simultaneously. Some mixtur es would make it difficult to maintain the seal of the p rotective m ask. Mixing some ag ents can also increase the toxic effects, either by a synergistic effect or by an impr oved absorption through the skin. 4. Militarily Significant Aspects of Biological Agents a. Classification. A biological agent is a microorganism that causes disease in personnel, plants, or animals or causes the d eterioration of material.6 Biologica l agents can be prions. (1) Pathogens. such as bacteria, ric kettsiae, or viruses. Pathogens are either naturally occurring or altered by random mutation or recombinant DNA techniques. (2) Toxins. Toxins are poisons formed as a specific secreting product in the metabolism of a vegetable or anim al organism, as distinguished from inorganic poisons. Such poisons can also b e manufactured by syn thetic proce sses.6 Toxins are produced by a variety of organisms, including microbes, snakes, insects, spiders, sea creatures, and plants.15 (3) Bioregulators. Bioregulators incl ude biochemical compounds that re gulate cell process es and physiologically a ctive compounds such as catalysts and enzymes. Although th ey can be found in the human body in small q uantities, introduction of large quantities can cause severe advers e effects or death.15 (4) Prions. Prions are proteins that can cause neu rodegenerative diseases in humans and animals.16 Proteins have a unique, genetically defined amino acid s equence that determ ines their s pecific shapes and functions. Normal cell proteins have the same amino acid building blocks but the y fold diffe rently than prions. When prions enter brain cells, they apparently c onvert normal proteins into prions. Ultimately, the infected brain cells die and release prions into the tissue. These prions enter, infect, and destr oy other brain cells. Prions entered the public's consci ousness during the mad cow epidemic that hit England in 1996.17 Transmission of the prions from cows to man is su spected to cause human illn ess. There are no known therapies effective against prions.18 b. Uses. Biological agents can be diss eminated and used against personnel, animals, plants, or material. Food and industri al products can be rendered unsafe or unfit for use by contamination or by the effects re sulting from contamination with biological agents. The US military forces are deployed th roughout the world. Associated with the I-7 movement of troops are risk s of in troduction of exotic agri cultural pests and animal disease agents thro ugh soil con tamination and transpo rtation of regulated items such as fruits, vegetables, meat, and dairy products, other food items, and animal products (e.g., trophies). The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APH IS) overse es the entry of cargo, pe rsonnel, eq uipment, personal property, mail, and their means of con veyance into the US.19 (See Appendix I for sel ected properties of ical agents.) (1) Antipersonnel. Biological antiper sonnel agent s are those that are effective directly aga inst humans. The threat would sele ct these agents on the basis of the agents' ability to cause death or disability. Potential biological a ntipersonnel agents include toxins, bacteria, ric kettsiae, vir uses, and toxins. (2) Antianimal. Biological antianimal agents are those that could be empl oyed against animals to incapacitate or destroy them through disease. Th e purposeful spreading of infectious agents that attac k cattle or other domestic animals can lead to serious consequenc es for a cou ntry's food supply or ex port of animal products (hides, wo ol, fats, and biological m edicinal products such as adrenalin, insulin, p ituitary extracts, cortisone, vaccines, and antisera).20 See Appendix J. (3) Antiplant. Biological a ntiplant ag ents are organisms that cause disea se or damage to plants. These agents may be used intentionally by an enemy to attack food or economicall y valuable crops, thereby reducing a nation's ability to resist aggression.20 See Appendix K. (4) Antimateri al. Antimaterial agents are organisms that degrade or break down some item of material. For example, fungi may dam age fabrics, rubber products, leather goods, or foodstuffs. Some bacteria produce highly acidic compounds that cause pitting in metals; these agents could create po tential probl ems with stockpiled material. Some bacteria can use petroleum products as an energy source and ca use residues that might clog fuel or oi l lines.20 c. Duration of Effectiveness. The duration of effe ctiveness of a biological agent refers to the persistency of the agent in the en vironment. It depends on the characteristics of the agent and environmental factors.3 (1) Biological a gent characteristics such as encapsulation (natural, such as bacterial spores, or ma nmade protective covering s), addition of dyes to the spray fluid, or possibly genetic engineering (of pathogens) ma y protect some agent s from sunlight and other destructive natu ral forces.3 Bacteria th at are resistant to environmental extremes frequently produce spores to allow survival du ring advers e conditions . Spore formation is not a method of reproduction inasmuch as each vegetati ve cell forms only a single spore and each spore germinates to form a si ngle vege tative cell. The bacterium (vegetati ve cell) makes a copy of its DNA. The DNA becomes surrounded by a series of membranes that accumulate calcium, dipicolinic acid (heat-resistant factor ), and protein layers. The resistant spore might remain dormant for year s without requiring nutrients or water and might survive under extreme ranges of tempe rature. When conditions become f avorable, the spore develops into an acti vely growing vegetative cell.21 (2) Ultraviolet (UV) radiat ion, relati ve humidity, wind speed, and temperature gradient are important weather factors in determining duration of effectiveness. I-8 d. Methods of Dissemination.22 Biological agents may be disseminated as aerosols , liquid droplets (toxins only), or dry powders. See Appendix L for addi tional infor mation on dissemination of biological agents. (1) Biological a gents may be delivere d in either wet or dry form. Dry powders composed of very small particles tend to hav e better dissemination characteristics and have advantages in storage. Dried agents re quire an increased level of technological sophistication to produce, although freeze-dr ying and spray-drying technologies have been available in the industry for a number of years. (2) The BW agents might be released against our forces or against civilian populations by means o f sprays, explosive devi ces, and contamination of food and water. Most commonly, delivery methods use aerosoli zed agents. (a) A BW agent can be released as a line source. A line source would be released perpendicular to the direction of the wind, upwi nd of the in tended target area. (b) A second ty pe of aerosol source is a point source, which is a stationary device for aerosolization of the agent, such as a stationary sprayer. A modified point source would be a group of spray devices, such as specially designed bomblets dispersed in a pattern on the ground or a missile or artille ry shell des igned to releas e such bom blets. e. Physiological Aspects. Employment co nsiderations for BW agents include the following: (1) ROE. The important portals of ent ry are the respiratory tract, the exposed mucosal surfaces (moist surfaces of nose, mout h, and eyes), and the digestive tract.23 In a biological at tack the respiratory ro ute would be the primary route of entry.3 The respiratory system is much more susceptible to penetration. The body is more resistant to invasion by microorganisms through the skin; however, penetration across the skin can occur. This is particularly true of abraded (broken) surfaces and som e toxins such as mycotoxins.23 Toxins absorbed through the respiratory tract can pro duce signs and symptoms d ifferent from those ac quired through natural occurrence.24 For example, staphylococ cal enterotoxin B when ingested in food causes acute gastrointestinal ( GI) illness; however, when delivered via aerosol to the respiratory tract, it produces respiratory disease.23 Personnel ca n encounter biological a gents by na tural routes, such as in water and food or by vectors. (2) Dosage. The BW agents are inhe rently more toxic than CW nerve agents on a weight-for-weight basis and can potentia lly provide broader cov erage per p ound of payload than CW agents.15 (a) Infective Dose.25 The infectivity of an agent reflects the relative ease with which microorganisms establi sh themselv es in a host species. Pa thogens with high infectivity cause diseas e with relatively few organisms. (b) Lethal Dose. Some pathogens produce toxins that can res ult in disease (for example, anthrax, botulinum, choler a, diphtheria, and typhus). The extreme toxicity of many toxin s causes the lethal do se to be much smaller than that of chemical agents. Hence, units of microgra ms (\u00b5g) or e ven nanograms (ng) may be used instead of milligrams (mg) in expressing toxicity. Huma n toxicity estimates are based on an imal data, and the ROE for the animals is not always what would be expected on the battlefield. I-9 Some human toxicity data are based on accidental contact, ingestion, or inhalation of these natural poisons. (3) ROA. The r ate of reaction to to xins varies widely. Rapid-a cting toxins generally incapacitate within minutes. Delaye d-acting a gents may t ake several hours to days to incapacitate. The time for maximum effects for pa thogens is n ormally more than 24 hours (unless the pathogen produces a toxi n). However, the incubation periods of microorganisms used in BW may be far sho rter than those expected by examining the natural disease. f. Requirements for a Weaponized BW Agent.22 The key factors that make a biological a gent suitable for an attack include availability or ease of p roduction in sufficient quantity; the ability to cause either lethal or i ncapacitati ng effects in humans at doses that are achievable and deliverable; ap propriate p article size in aero sol; ease of diss emination; stability (while mainta ining virulence) after production in storage, weapons, and the environment; and susceptibility of intended victims with nonsusceptibility of frien dly forces. (1) Availability or Ease of Production . Many replicating age nts (bacteri a and viruses) can be produced in large quantities wi th modern fermentation and viral production technologies. Some toxins, like ricin, are wide ly available because their source in nature is ubiquitous and the process necess ary to harvest the toxin is technically straigh tforwar d. On the other hand, some replicating agents are very difficult to grow in quantity, and many toxins are produced in nature in such low quantities that harvesting them is imp ractical (shellfish toxins are a good example). (2) Incapacitati on and Lethality. BW agents are likely to be selected for their ability to ei ther incapacitate or kill the human targets of the attack. A BW agent does not necessarily have to be l ethal to be useful as a military we apon. An agent such as Venezuelan equine enc ephalitis (VEE) viru s could cause incapacitati on among large numbers of unit personnel. If lethality is de sired, agents such as anthrax have h igh case fatality rate s once infec tion is esta blished in u nimmunized Aerosol. An effec tive weaponized BW agent is of a particle size that would allow i t to be ca rried for long distances by prevailing winds and inhaled deeply into the lungs of the unsuspecting victims. The size ra nge of particles that meets both of these conditions is 1 to 5 micro ns in diamet er. Particles larger tha n this would either settle out into the ground or more lik ely be f iltered out i n the upper respiratory tract of thos e who inhale them. Particl es in this size range are invisible to the human eye; thus, a cloud of such particles would not generally be detected by th ose attac ked, even if such a cloud were to be carri ed through their position. It is worth noting, however, that particles outside this size r ange are still da ngerous and able to cause deadly illness es, even though their transmission effici ency is less. (4) Ease of Dissemination. An effective weaponized BW agent is easily disseminated in the open air by using off-the-she lf devices such as industrial sprayers or other types of aerosol-producing de vices. Thes e could be mounted on an airplane, boat, car, or other moving vehicle, or even placed in a stationary position. An alternative method would be to disseminate the agent in an enclos ed space (e.g., a building) where it could more efficiently infect or intoxicate humans livi ng or working in the area. I-10 (5) Stability after Producti on. Once an adversary produces a BW agent in quantity, it must be fairly stable\u2014either in bulk storage or once put into a weapon or delivery system. It must, therefore, retain its viability and virulence or toxicity during production, storage, transportation, and delivery. (6) Susceptibility and Nonsusceptibili ty. An effective BW agent is one t o which the target f orce is known to be susceptible (i.e., not imm unized against), but to which the adversary possess es hig h levels of immunity, usually via vaccination. 5. Militarily Significant Aspects of Toxic Industrial Chemicals a. Classification. The TIC are chemicals that are toxic to plants, animals, or humans. b. Uses. The TIC are found in abundance in all c ountries, an d are used in chemical manufacturing processes, agriculture (pesti cides), water treatment (chlorination), and many other areas. Each year, more than 70, 000 different chemicals amounting to billions of tons of m aterial are produced, processed, or consumed by the global chemical industry. A large portion of these c hemicals m ay exhibit c haracteristi cs or be sufficiently hazardous to be a threat in a militar y situation.2 c. Characteris tics of TIC. The TIC of military concern may exist as soli ds, liquids, or gases. For many cases, releas e of a TIC may involve a change of the state of the chemical, therefore ma king protection difficult . Like CW agents, TIC include many lethal compounds. (1) Toxicity. M any TIC, du e to thei r toxicity, can cause incapacitation or death. (2) Corrosiveness. Many TIC are highly corrosive. Special equipment containers and procedures are necessary to ensure safe handling. (3) Flammability. Many TIC are highly flammable and present a major fire hazard. (4) Explosiveness. Unlik e CW agents, TIC can be highly explosive and present a serious th reat when handled. (5) Reactivity. Many TIC r eact violen tly with wa ter or other materials, and thus present dangers u pon contact with other materials, including air. (6) Byproducts. When burned, mi xed, or exploded, many TIC produce additional highly toxic byproducts. (7) Quantities available. The sheer vo lume and widespread availability of TIC present a se rious danger in the event of a relea se. d. Duration of Effectiveness. A number of factors determine the amount of time a TIC would present a danger after release. Fa ctors includ e the physical properties of the TIC as well as weather, terrain, and conditions at the release site. These factors affect TIC in the same manner as that for che mical agents.3 e. Physiological Aspects. Exposure to TIC affects the body in a variety of ways. Generally, they disrupt bodily functions. The effects are dependent o n the routes of entry, toxicity of t he chemical, and the concentration to which ex posed. I-11 (1) ROE. The TIC can enter the body through inhalation, ing estion, der mal absorption, or a combination of these methods. The primary concern for exposure is that of the inhalation of a TIC as a gas.2 (2) Exposure Concentration and Levels of Concern. The type and seriou sness of effects from exposure to TIC, lik e any chem ical is dependent upon the concentration and length of time one is exposed. This concentra tion and time relationship is unique to every chemical. The dosages of TIC are expressed in parts per million (ppm) . In genera l, TIC tend to be at least one order of magnitude less potent than nerve agents and tend not be rapidly lethal in small quantities. Standards have been d eveloped for industry fo r different exposure scenarios. (a) Immediatel y Dangerous to Life an d Health (IDLH):24 The definition of IDLH that was derived during the Standards Completion Program (SCP) was based on the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) definiti on stipulated in 30 CFR 11.3(t). The purpose for establishing an IDLH value in the SCP was to ensure that a wor ker could escape without injury or irreversible health effects from an IDLH exposure in the event of the failure of respiratory protection equipmen t. The highly reliable breathing ap paratus providing maximum work er protection was permitted. In determining IDLH values, the ability of a worker to escape without loss of l ife or irreversible health effects was considered along with severe eye or respirator y irri tation and other deleterious effects (e.g., disorientation or lack of coordination) that could prevent escape. As a safety mar gin, the SCP IDLH values were based on t he effects that might occur as a co nsequence of a 30- minute exposure. However, the 30-minute peri od was not meant to imply that workers should stay in the work environment any longer than necessary. In fact, every effort should be made to exit immediately. (b) Refer to the United Sta tes Army Center for Health Promotion and Preventive Medicine (USACHPPM) Technical Guide 230, Chemical Exposure Guidelines fo r Deployed M ilitary Personnel , for obtaining the military exposure guidelines for assessing exposure concentrations for TIC. f. TIC Hazard Assessmen t. As part o f the IPB process, a pla nner must assess the likelihood of a release or exposure as well as the actual TIC material. Some example considerations are3\u2014 (1) Accidents i n civilian operations significantly increase when technically trained personnel flee an area, such as a combat zone (CZ). Civilian personnel r emaining may be pressured to operate equipment beyond their trai ning/technical expertise in a area of combat. (2) Pipelines can offer a very att ractive target for terrorists because actions can be planned well in advance of execution and pipelines do not rely on shipping or transportat ion scheduled. (3) Storage ya rds, ports, airfields and rail yards often contain significant amounts of transiting TIC. This not only pres ents opportunities for i mprovised use against US forces, b ut also presents increased possibi lity of accidents and targe ts for those who want to des troy the TI C (such as ammunition precursor chemicals). g. Pesticides. Large stockpiles of o bsolete pesticides have been accumulated in virtually all developing countries over periods sometimes exceeding four decades.28 The term \"pestic ides,\" as used by US fo rces incl ude insecticides, rodenticides, fungicides, and I-12 herbicides. The health effects of pesticides depe nd on the type of pesticide. Some, such as the organophosphates a nd carbamates, affect th e nervous system. Ot hers may irritate the skin or eyes. Some pesticides may be carci nogens. Others may affect the hormone or endocrine s ystem in the body.29 The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has recognized the dangers of many pesticides and publishes l ists of those pesticides that are either banned or severely restricte d in their us e. Applicable service personnel ( e.g., Army preventive medicine (PVNTMED), Air Force ci vil engineer ing, public health) can provide information on specific pesticides that could be used in sp ecific areas of operation (AOs).

I-15 Chapter II CHEMI CAL WARFARE AGENTS AND THEIR PROPERTIES 1. Backgrou nd The CW agents can be classified ac cordin g to t heir physiological effects or their military use; they include choking, nerve, blood, blister, and incapaci tating agents.1 This chapter con tains definitions fo r selected physi cal and chemical properties; defini tions for selected toxicity terms; and the phy sical, chem ical, and physiological properties of selected CW agents and precurs ors listed in Table II-1.

Th e FP is the temperature at which the solid and liquid phas es of a given substance are in equi NOTE: Some liquids can be co oled well below thei r freezi ng temperatures and still remai n in a liquid state.

The density of a chemical agent is the mass per unit volume of t he substance. Because volume vari es with temperature, a specified temperature should be gi ven. The density of a l iquid or solid is usually given as grams per mil liliter (g/ml) or gr ams per cubic centimeter (g/cm3).2 NOTE: Solid density can be fur ther specified as bulk (or appa rent) d ensity or crystalline (or true) density. Both proper ties describe the mass per unit volum Bulk density includes the volume of th e voids, p particles, whereas c rystalline density in cludes only the volume occupi ed by th material it self.5 g. Vapor Dens ity. Vapor density is the ra tio of the weight of a given volume of a gaseous sub stance and that of the same volu m conditions of pressure and temperature.6 For the purpose of this man ual, the oth er gas i air. To calculate the vapor density, divide th e MW of the compound of interest by 29 (the average M W of air). If the vapor density is less than 1, the gas will generally rise in the air . If the vapor density is greater than 1, the gas will generally settle on th e ground. h. VP. Th between the vapor and its liquid (or solid) state. It is the pressure in a closed spa ce above substance when no other gas is present. The VP varies with tempe rature, so the temperature should be stated. The VP increases as temperature incre ases.2 i. Volatility. Volatility is the tendency of a solid or liquid m aterial to pass into the vapor state at a given temperature.7 The volatility depends on vapor pressure and varies with tempe rature. Volatility is expressed as milligrams of vapor per cubic meter ( It is calculated numerically by an equat ion derived from the perfect gas law: II-2 V = 16020 x MW x VP T Where V = Volatility (mg/m3) MW = molecular weight VP = vapo r pressure (in torr at a specified temperature) T = Kelvin temperature (degrees C + 273.15) j. Latent Hea t of Vaporization. The late nt heat of vaporizati on is the qu antity of energy absorbed or given off as a su bstance und ergoes a change in state with no change in temperature.7 It is calculated usin g the following equation:8 Hv = ln 10 + t)2 = Enthalpy of vaporization (latent heat of vaporization) T = Kelvin temperature = (degrees C + 273.15) R = Ideal gas law constant (1.987 cal K-1 mol-1) B,C = Vapor pre ssure constants (from Antoine or Clausius Clapeyron fit) t = Temperature in degrees C k. Viscosity. Viscosity is resistance that a gaseous or liquid system offers to flow when it is subjected to a shear stress.9 The more complex the molecules in a liquid and the stronger th e intermolecular forces between them, the mor e difficult it is for the molecules to move past each other and the grea ter the visc osity of the liquid. A fluid with a large viscosity resists motion . Also, as te mperatures increase, the viscosity of the liqui d decreases.2 Units for viscosity are given in centipoises (cP). l. Surface Ten sion. Surface tension is the force that causes the surface of a liquid to contract, reducing its surface area to a minimum. The molecules within a liquid are attracted equally in all directions by the cohe sive forces within the liquid. However, the molecules on the surface of a liquid are attrac ted only into the liquid and to either side. This unbalanced molecular attraction tends to pull the surface molecules back into the liquid such that the minimum number of molecules possible are on t he surface.2 Units for surface tension are dynes per centimeter (dynes/cm). m. Flash Point. The flash point is the temperature at which a liquid or volatile s olid gives off sufficient vapor to form an ignit able m ixture near the surface of the liquid .7 n. Decomposition Temperature. The deco mposition temperature is the temperature at which a chemical breaks down in to two or more substances.4 Because reaction rates vary; decom position temperature is a functi on of both tem perature and time (som e reactions are slower than others). II-3 o. Solubility. The solubil ity of a solute is the qua ntity that will dissolve i n a given amount of solvent to produce a saturated solution.2 p. Hydrolysis. Hydrolysis is the rea ction of a compound with water wher eby decomposition of the substance occurs.2 New substances (hydrolysis products) fo rm when a compound r eacts with water. q. Half-Life of a Reaction (t 1/2). This is the time required for half of the or iginal concentrati on of the limiting reac tant to be consumed.4 r. Stability in Storage. Stability in stor age determines the p ractical usefulness of a compound. If a compou nd decomposes in st orage, it will have littl e military operational value. The addition of stabilizers will typically slow down decomposition and polymerization in stora ge. s. Action on Metals, Plastics, Fabrics, and Paint. This item describes the action between a given compound and different materi als. Depending on their activity, some chemicals can react wit h and degra de material s they contact. Chemic al agent-resistant coating (CA RC) can mi nimize this effect. t. Specific He at. The specific heat is the quantity of heat required to raise the temperature of 1 gram of a substa nce 1 degree C2 (given in lieu of latent heat of vaporization for milita ry chemical compounds only). 3. Definitions of Toxicit y-Related Terms a. ROE. Chemical agents enter the body throug h the respiratory tra ct, skin, eyes, and by ingestion. Any part of the respiratory tract, from the nose to t he lungs, m ay absorb inhaled gases and aerosols. For some agents, effects are more severe in normally sweaty areas. The skin can also absorb vapors. The surface of the sk in, eyes , and mucous membranes can absorb droplets of liquids and solid particles. Wounds or abrasion s are probably more susceptible to absor ption than the intact skin. Chemical agents can contaminate food or drink , and the refore, the body can absorb them through the gastrointest inal tract. Nerve agen ts exert th eir toxic effects through the skin, eyes, and lungs. Inha lation is the usual route of expo sure for blood agents. Blister agents damage skin and other tissues that they co ntact, to include eyes a nd lungs. The chok ing agents exert their effects only if inhaled. The onse t and severity of signs ma y vary, depending upon the ROE and dos age.1 The ROEs have been lim ited to those that are lik ely to be encountered in the field: vapor inhalation with eye exposure, skin exposure to vapor, and skin exposure to liquid. The toxicity esti mates given for percutaneous vapor expos ure for the nerve agents are based on bare sk in expo sures. The toxicity esti mates for mustard agent percutaneous vapor exposure are based o n clothed skin exposures. Effective dosages of liquid on the sk in are based upon data for bare sk in.9 b. Dosage. Dosage is the amount of substance administered (or received) per body weight.11 In this manual, dosage is usu ally expressed as millig rams per ki logram (mg/kg) of body weight for liquid a gents and as milligrams-minute per meter cubed for (mg- min/m3) for vapor expos ure. Dosage s are given for a 70-kg man.9 (1) Median Lethal Dosage (LD 50) of Liquid Agent. The LD 50 is the amou nt of liquid agent expected to kill 50 percent of a group of exposed, unprotected individuals. (2) Median Effective Dosage (ED 50) of Liquid Agent. The ED 50 is the am ount of liquid agent expected to cause some defined effect (e.g., severe, such as prostration, II-4 collapse, convulsions; mild, such as erythe ma) in 50 percent of a group of exposed, unprotected individuals. (3) Median Lethal Dosage (LCt 50) of a Vapor or Ae rosol. The LCt 50 of a chemical agent in vapor form is the dosage that is lethal to 50 percent of exposed, unprotected personnel fo r a defined MV and ex posure duration. (4) Median Effective Dosage (ECt 50) of a Vapor or Aerosol. The ECt 50 is the effective dosage of a chemical agent vapor tha t is sufficient to cause some defined effect in 50 percent of exposed, unprote cted personnel for a defined MV and ex posure duration. NOTES: 1. Effectiv e dosages can be calculated fo r more or less than the median dosage (e.g., LCt 25, ED 84). Such calcula tions require know ledge of the probit (Bli ss) slope and use the probit equation.10 2. Selected toxicity e stimates are assigned provisional values. A toxicit y estimate is considered provisional based on only having li mited data, but the da ta are within the range of available a nimal data or when the agent i s presumed to be comparable in toxicity to a related agent.10 3. Physiological Stressors. Ph ysiological stressors include anxiety, heat, and humidity and are li kely to reduce toxicity estimates. In other words, t he agent i s potentia lly more effective.10 c. Modifying Factors. Af ter exposur e to a chemical agent va por, a person may show signs and symptoms th at are less or more severe than expected. The severity of the effects may depend upon some of the following potential variables: (1) How long the person held his or her breath during short exposure. (2) Speed with which he or she donned the mask . (3) Proper fit of the mask . (4) Whether the body absorbed the ag ent through the skin. (5) Whether the agent increased the MV. (6) MV of the person at the time of exposure. (7) Physical exertion of the person at the time of exposure. (8) Rate of detoxification, es pecially if exposure was long. (9) Previous exposure to chemical agents and typ e of agent. d. MV. The MV is the volume of air exchanged in one minute. In genera l, as the MV increases, the apparent dosage decreases b ecause mor e agent is inhaled into the lungs. It is important to note that increasing resp iratory rate does not necessarily increase MV and may actually decrease it. The relationshi p of MV to dosage is a pproximate ly linear over ranges of MV from 10 to 50 liters. For example, if the LCt 50 is given as 35 mg-min/m3, for an MV of 15 liters, it would be approximately 50 mg-min/m3 for an MV of 10 liters and approximately 15 mg-min/m3 for an MV of 30 liters.3 Where available, MV profile tables are provided in Appendix H . II-5 e. Exposure Duration. The official int erim standards for inhalation/ocula r exposures are for a 2-minute duration; thos e for percutane ous vapor exposure (masked personnel) are for a 30-minute duration. More data have become available s ince the interim standards were defined, a nd they are al so given f or longer exposures, as data are available.10 f. Temperature. Selected agents have toxicity est imates fo r hot and moderate temperatures. Hot temperatures are define d as greater th an 85 degrees F. Moderate temperatures are defin ed as 65 to 85 degrees F. In general, as the temperature increases, the effective dosage decreases. The dosages fo r hot temperatures are about half of those for moderate temperatures.10 g. Endpoint (Physiological Effects). Toxi city estimates are provided for different endpoints to include lethality, severe e ffects, threshold effects, and mild effects. (1) For nerve agents, severe effects include prostration, collapse, and/or convulsions . Some dea ths will occur. Thre shold effects for percuta neous vapor exposure include slig ht, not necessarily significant, ChE inhibition and/or localized sweating. Mild effects following inhalation/ocular exposure in clude miosis, rhinorrhea, and tight chest. These effects can occur in the absence of meas urable ChE inhibition in the blood.10 (2) For percuta neous exposure to b lister agents, severe effects include vesication and mild effects include erythema, edema, pain, and itching\u2014depending upon the agent. Severe effects following ocul ar exposure include pain, conjunctivitis, blepharospasm, and temporary blindness; mild effects consist of erythema and minimal conjunctivit is.10 h. ROD. The human body can detoxi fy some toxic materials. The ROD i s an important f actor in det ermining the hazards of repeated exposure to CW agents. Many CW agents are essentially cumulative in their effects. i. ROA. The ROA of a ch emical agent is th e rate at which th e body react s to or is affected by that agent. The rate v aries wide ly, even between those of similar tactical or physiological classification. j. Concentration-Time (Ct) Profile. Dosa ge is a f unction of Ct; however, the equation k=Ct does not describe all cases of in jury from ch emical agen t exposure. As seen in some Ct profile tables, a given effective do sage does not always produce a specific effect for all duration exposures. In order to des cribe the effective dosage s better math ematically, the equation Cnt=k is used. The exponent \"n\" is calle d the toxic load exponent (TLE). See Figure II-1 and II-2 (page II-8) (a) When the TLE value is greater tha n 1, effective dosages increase as the exposure duration increases (and t he exposure concentrati on decreases). (b) When the TLE value is less than 1, effective dosages decrease as the exposure duration increases (the agent is mo re potent following long exposures to low concentrati ons than sh ort exposures to high concentrations). (c) When the TLE value equals 1 ( Haber's La w), a given dosage (Ct) produ ces a given effect\u2014independent of concentration or ex posure duration. When the Ct profile is unknown, a default exponent value of one is us ed (TLE is assumed to be 1). II-6 The effect the T LE has on the effective dosa ge is ill ustrated in the follo wing Ct profile tables. In the equation k-Cnt, there are thre e possi ble c ases for the valu e of the T LE(n).

The line gives the effective dosages where 1 6 percent of 70 -kg males w ould experience severe ef fects. This is roughl y equivalent t o the lethal dosage for 1 pe rcent.

T he re gion show s the e ffective dosages that w ould cause m ild effects in 16-84 % of 70 -kg males exposed. Notice as exposu re duration (time) increases, the effectiv e dosage (LCt/ECt) increase s. There is no single LCt or ECt for an e xposure ; they are time-de pendent. Figure II-2. Ct Profile for Dosage versus Exposure Duration II-8 k. Probit Slope. Dose res ponse curves can be used to assess f rom a graphical depiction the results of an exposure to a CW ag ent. The dose response curve is impacted by the concentration of the CW agent and durati on of the ex posure (i.e., a graphical x-axis plot) and response (i.e. , a graphical y-axis plot ). The probit slope is de rived from dose response curve data and corresponds to the vari ability in the response of the pop ulation to the chemical agent. (a) A high prob it slope value means t hat a small change in the dose will make a large change in the number of in dividuals responding to the chemical agent. With very potent agents, a small change in the dose can a lso make a big change in the level and severity of the effects produced. (b) A low probit slope value means th at a relatively large change in the dose will make for a relatively minor change in th e number of individuals responding to the given dose. l. Degree of Confidence ( DOC).10 The DOC is an indication of the level of confidence in each toxicity estimate and is provided to indicate uncert ainty. It is a subjective evaluation based on the quality and quantity of the underlying data an d the method(s) by which the estimate was derived. The followi ng definitions are provided: (1) Low. There are no primary data, and/or the data are extremely limi ted. (2) Moderate. There are primary data for both humans and animals, and there are sufficient data for mathematical modeling . (3) High. There are ample primary da ta for both humans and animals, and there is good statistical confidence in the value. 4. Choking Agents Choking agents are CW agents that attack lung tissue, primarily causing pulmonary edema. They cause irritation to the bronchi, trachea, lary nx, pharyn x, and nose. Initial symptoms may include tears, dry throat, coug hing, choking, tightnes s of chest, nausea, vomiting, and headache.1 In extreme cases, m embranes s well, lungs become fill ed with liquid, and death results from lack of oxyge n; thus, these agents \"choke\" an unprotected person. Fatalities of this type are c alled \"d ry-land drowni ngs.\" Of th e choking agents, phosgene (CG) is the only one con sidered lik ely to be use d in the future.12 The protective mask gives protection against choking agents.1 a. CG (see Table II-2 [pa ge II-10]). CG is a colorless gas with an odor similar to musty hay or rotting fruit.13 Vapors can linger for some time in trenches and low-lying areas under calm or light winds.12 The severity of poisoning cannot b e estimated from the immediate symptoms, and the full effect can be delayed up to 72 hours after exposure.14 Any acti vity or stress after exposure is likely to exacerbate the effects and turn a sublethal exposure into a lethal exposure.10 Lung dama ging concen trations may not one C ClOCl Molecular Form ula: C Molecu lar We ight: 98.92 Physical St ate Colorles s gas that is readily liquefied 1 Odor Musty hay or ro tting fruit 2 Boiling Po int @ 0oC 6 Vapor Density (relativ e to air) 3.4 (calculated) Vapor Pres sure (torr) 1.40 x 103 @ 25oC; 7.60 x 106 @ 7.8oC; 3.53 x 106 @ 0oC (calculated from va por pressure) 3,4 Latent Heat of ization ble Viscosity of Vapor (cP) Data not availa ble Surface Tension (dynes/cm) Data not availa ble Flash Point Nonflammable 1 Decom posit ion Temperature Comp lete @ 80 0oC 7 Solubility Limited in water; 8 miscible w ith common organ ic solv ents, petroleum, and lu bricating oil 9,10 Rate of Hy drolysis t1/2 = 0.25 sec. @ 13oC; does n ot react quickly with water vapor, but it immediately reacts w ith liquid w ater to yield carbon diox ide and hy drochloric acid 8,11 Hydrolysis Products Hydrochloric acid and carbon diox ide 9 Stability in Storage Stable in steel c ontainers @ am bient temperatu res for at least o ne year if CG is dry; stability decreases at elevated temperatures 12 Action on Meta ls or Other Mate rials None w hen CG is dry ; acidic an d corrosive w hen moist 13 Other D ata Eye toxicity Initial effects resemble those of tear gas. 14 Inhalatio n tox icity Caus es pulmo nary edema 15 Rate of action Immediate to 3 hours, depend ing on concentration 16 Means of detection in fie ld M18A2 CA DK, MM1 17 Protection requ ired Protective mask 15 Deco ntaminatio n Not required in the fi eld ex cept in very cold clim ates 18 Use Delay ed action casua lty agent 19 II-10 Table II-2.

Nerve Age nts Nerve agen ts are more toxic than other CW agents. They may cause effects with in seconds and death with in minutes.15 The nerve agents are all liquids , not nerve gas per se. They can be absorbed through any body su rface and can penetrate ordinary cloth ing rapidly.1 They are divided into the G agents and V agents . The V agents have high boiling points, low volatility, and resultant high persistency.12 Even though the V agents are considered primarily a contact hazard12; they are at least twice as potent as GB, and even a minute amount of airborne mate rial is extremely hazardous.10 Nerve agents are cumulative poisons. Re peated exposure to low concentrati ons may produce symptoms.1 Level 4 mis sion-oriented protective post ure (MOPP4) is re quired for protection.1 a. Physiological Effect. B oth the G and V agents have the same physiological action on humans. Normally, the enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE) binds and hydrolyzes the neurotransmitter ACh, which term inates the activity of ACh at t he receptor sites. Upon exposure, the nerve agents bind to AChE, ma king it una ble to bind with ACh. As a result, ACh is not hydrolyzed. The accumulation of A Ch causes hyperacti vity of the body organs stimulated by cholineraic neruons.15 Individuals poison ed by nerve agents may experi ence symptoms in the f ollowing order: Miosis, run ny nose, and chest tigh tness . Dim vision and headache . Nausea , and cramps . II-13 Drooling , excessive sweating, drowsiness, and confusion . Difficulty b reathing, t witching, je rking, and staggering . Convulsion s and coma. b. Miosis. Wh en airborne vapor comes in contact with the ey es, miosis occurs as a result of a direct local effect of the nerve ag ent on the eyes and can occur prior to any inhibition of ChE in th e blood. Th is type of exposure is frequently accompanied by tightness of the chest and/or rhinorrhea, and any or all other sympto ms can occur. In cases of nerve agent exposure not involving vapor co ntact with the eyes, mi osis is one of the last effects to occur before death.10 c. Treatment. Treatment of nerve agent poisonin g includes use of atropi ne, 2-PAM chloride, antidote for nerve agents (CANA), and pyridosti gmine bromide (PB). (1) Atropine binds to receptor sites bl ocking the excess acetylcholine cau sed by nerve agent (2) 2-PAM Cl a cts by reac tivating Ch E inhibited by a nerve agent.15 Prompt treatment is essential because after the agent binds to AChE, a second reaction occurs in which the agent loses o ne alk yl or alk oxy grou p. This phosphorylated AChE is called an \"aged\" enzy me and is completely resistant to both spontaneous and oxime-medicated (2- PAM Cl) re activation. The \"aging\" period vari es from min utes to hours depending on the type of agent.16 For GD, the \"agin g\" half-time is within 2 minutes.17 (3) The CANA prevents and treats con vulsions caused by exposure to ner ve agents in moderate to severe cases.1 (4) PB is a pretreatment for exposu re to GD. PB a nd AChE bi nd and form what is called a carbamoylated AChE. Altho ugh PB is also an AChE inhibitor, it is unlike nerve agents in that the interaction betw een PB and AChE is freely and spontaneously reversible a nd it does not undergo the aging process. The carbamoylated AChE is fully protected fr om attack b y nerve age nts. Atro pine is still needed to co unteract the excess ACh and 2-PAM Cl is still needed t o reactivate AChE active sites that were protected by PB.17 PB is available t o US forces in active theaters of operation (TOs).1 d. Tabun (GA) (see Table II-6). GA was the first of the nerve agents developed by the Germans.15 GA is primarily an inhalation hazard. See Table II-7 (page II-17) for GA toxicity esti mates.

It is hypothesized that clothing retar ds evaporat ion, thereby increasing the effective dose.10 See Table II-9 (page II-20) for toxicity ight: 140.09 Physical State Colorles s liquid 1 Odor None w hen pure 2 Boiling Po int 150oC (ex trapolated) @ 1.1255 @ 0oC (ex trapolated) 6 Vapor Density (relativ e to air) 4.8 (calculated) Vapor Pres sure (torr) x 10o Volatility (mg/m3) 1.87 @ 25oC; 3.37 x 103 @ 0oC (calc ulated from vapor pressure) 3 Latent Heat of Vapor ization (kcal/mol) 11.6 @ 25oC; 11.7 @ trapolated)7 8 Decom posit ion Temperature Comp lete deco mposition occur s within 2 1/2 hr @ 150oC 9 Solubility Comp letely miscible w ith water and or ganic so lvents 1,2 Rate of Hy drolysis Varies w ith pH and temperature; at 20oC, t1/2 = 27 min. @ pH 1 ; t1/2 = 3 1/2 hr @ pH 2; t 1/2 = 80 hr @ pH 7; t 1/2 = 5.4 min @ pH 10; a nd t 1/2 = 0.6 min @ pH 11. 10 Hydrolysis Products Under ac idic co further h ydrolyze to produce methy lphosphon ic acid (MPA) and e condi acid (MF PA) and isopro pyl alcohol are initially formed which further h ydrolyze to produce MPA and HF. 11 Stability in Storage GB stabilized w ith tributy lamine can be stored in steel container s for at least 5 to 10 years @ ambient temperature.

Th e cyanogen blood agents AC and CK a ffect the bodily functions by inactivatin g the cy tochrome oxidase system.18 This poison ing prevents cell respiration and the normal transfe r of oxygen from the blood to body tissues.18 SA causes hemolysis of the red bloo d cells.19 Cyanogen agents are highly volatile and, therefore, nonpersisten t.20 Exposu re at high c oncentrations causes effects within seconds and death within minutes in unprotected personnel.18 The protective mask with fresh filters gives adequate protection against field concentrations.1 After exposure to AC and CK, filters should be ch anged.12 See FM 3-11.4 for filter change criteri a. a. AC (see Table II-18 [pa ge II-32]). Pure AC is a nonpersis tent, colorless liquid that is highly volatile. It has a faint odor, similar to bitter almonds, that sometimes cannot be detected even in lethal concentrations.12 Inhalation of small amounts causes giddiness, headache and faintness, confusion , palpitation and pain in the chest and region of the heart, difficulty breathing, and ultimately unconsciousnes s.10 Inhalat ion of high concentrati ons can init ially cause breathing that is deeper and more rapid than is normal at rest, followed closely by a loss of consciousn ess. This progresses to respiratory arrest, cessation of cardiac ac tivity, and d eath.18 Exposure to AC causes an increase in respiration within a few seconds; a casualty may not be abl e to hold his breath.

Blister Agents (Vesicants ) Blister agents are used to produc e casualti es, to degrade fighting efficiency, and to restrict use of terrain and equipment.1 Blister agents are CW agents that act on the eyes, mucous membranes, lu ngs, skin, and blood-forming organ s.12 The most toxic rout e of exposure is inhalation/ocular.10 The severity of a blister ag ent burn relates directly to the concentrati on of the agent, the duration of contact with th e skin,1 and the location on the body. Most blister agents are insidious in acti on except for lewisite (L) and phosgene oxime (CX), which cause imm ediate pain on cont act. Assume MOPP4 whenever liquid or vaporized agents are known to be present.1 Decontaminate within 1 or 2 min utes after exposure to help prevent or decrease tissue da mage.21 The blister agents are divided into three groups: mustards, arsenicals, and urticants. a. Mustards. This group of agents incl udes the sulfur mustards (H and HD) an d the nitrogen mustards (HN-1, HN-2, and HN-3). Because of their physical properties, mustards a re persistent under cool conditio ns; however, evaporation increases as the temperature increases.21 It is pos sible to incr ease their persistency even more by dissolving them in thickeners.12 (1) Distilled Mustard (HD) (see Table II-24 [page II-38]). HD is a pale yellow to dark bro wn oily liqu id with a garlic-like odor.13 The eyes and respi ratory tract are the most sensiti ve target organs.10 The latency period for ocular effects is shorter than that for pulmonary effects, and acutely, ocul ar effects are more deb ilitating.10 Both mustard vapor and liquid rapidly penetrate the skin. Warm , moist areas with thin skin (perineum, external genitalia, underarms, inside elbo w, and neck) ar e much more sensitive.21 Sweaty skin absorbs more mus tard than dry skin. Wi th an increase in temp erature (>85 degrees F) and humidity, the effective dosages decrease an d are about half of those for temperatures from 65 to 75 degrees F.10 Mild symptoms caused from vap or exposure include tearing, II-37 itchy, burni ng, grit ty feeling in the eyes, rh inorrhea, sneezing, hoarseness, hacking cough, and erythe ma. Severe symptoms include marked lid edema, possibl e corneal da mage, severe pain in the eyes, productive cough, dyspnea, and vesication.21 Repeated exposures can cause an increase in sensitivity.21 See Table II-25 (page II-40) for toxicity es timates.

Urtican ts are not true vesicants because, unlike mustard and L, they do not produce fluid-filled blisters; rather, they produce s olid lesions resembling urticaria.21 CX is the primary urticant of milit ary interest (see Table II-44). It ca n penetrate garments and rubber much more quickly tha n other agents.21 It affects the skin, eyes, and lungs. No other chemical agent produces such an immediat ely painful onset that is foll owed by rapid tissue necrosis. The ski n lesion s, in particular, are similar to those caused by a strong acid. The rapid skin damage renders the skin more susceptible to a second type of agent.21 Droplets on the skin are potentiall y lethal. CX has also b een classified as a lung poison.10 See Table II-45 (page II-64) and Appendix H RTECS Num ber: Data not available Prop erties Structural Form ula: C ClCl NOH stalline, deliqu escent-solid w hen pure 1 Odor Unpleasa nt and irritating; 1 resembles new -mown ha y at lo w concentrations 2 Boiling Po int 129oC 3 (with decompos ition un less high ly pure) FP/MP 39oC (MP) 3 Liquid De nsity (g/mL) Data not availa ble Vapor Density (relativ e to air) 3.9 (calculated) Vapor Pres sure (torr) 2.43 x 101 @ 50oC 3 Volatility (mg/m3) 1.37 x 105 @ 50oC (calcu lated from vapor press ure) 3 Latent Heat of Vapor ization (kcal/mol) 11.2 @ 50oC (calculated from vapor pressure) 3 Viscosity (cP) Data not availa ble Viscosity of Vapor (cP) Data not availa ble Surface Tension (dynes/cm) Data not availa ble Flash Point Data not availa ble Decom posit ion Temperature Below 129oC 4 Solubility Very soluble in both w ater and common organ ic solvents 5 Rate of Hy drolysis Slow in water @ ambient temper ature and p H 7; hydrolyzes 5% w ithin six days @ ambient temper ature; dilute acids slow down the hydrolysis rate even further, whereas basic solutio ns react very violently with CX 2 Hydrolysis Products Carbon d ioxide, hydrogen chloride, and h ydroxylamin e 2 Stability in Storage Pure, unstabiliz ed CX de compo ses on storage @ ambient temperature.

Incapacitating Agents Used in a military context, incapacitation is understood to mean ina bility to perform one's milita ry mission. Since missi ons vary, for the purpo se of this m anual, incapacitation means the i nability to perform any military task effectively and implies that the condition was achieved via the deliberate use of a nonlet hal weapon.22 Incapacitating agen ts differ from other CW agents in that the lethal dose is theoretically many times greater than the incapacitati ng dose. Thus, they do not seri ously endanger life except in cases exceeding many times the effective dose, and they produce no perma nent injury.1 Virtually all drugs whose most prominent effects are psychological or behavioral can be classified in to four fairly discre te categories: deliriant s, stim ulants, depressants, and psychedelics. They interfere with the higher functions of the brai n such as attention, orientation, perception, memory, motivation, conceptual thinking, planning, and judgment. 22 a. Deliriants.22 These are drugs that produce delirium, which is an inca pacitating syndrome involving confusion, hallucinosis, and disorganized speech and behavior. Many II-64 drugs can produce delirium; however, the chem icals in the subgroup anticholinergics are regarded as most likely to be used as militar y incapacitati ng agents. Of these drugs, 3- Quinuclidinyl benzilate (BZ) is considered the most likely candidate for military use (see Table II-46) . BZ is capable of prod ucing delirium at a very low dosage with a high safety margin. Skin absorption is possibl e with prop er solvents. See Table I I-47 (page II-66) for toxicity esti mates. See Table II-48 (page II-68) for sympto ms. BZ intoxication requires from two to three days to reach full recovery. Table II-46.

Stimulants are drugs that produce a temporary increase of the functional activity or efficiency of an organism or any of its parts.3 They include amphetamines, cocaine, caffeine, nicotine, and epileptogenic substances such as strychnine II-66 and Metrazole. None of the conventional st imulants appears to have sufficien t potency to be usable a s an airborne incapacitating agen t, and low doses could even prove counterpro ductive, since moderate stimulatio n might easily lead to a soldier's m ore energetic and aggressive performance.22 d. Depressants. Depressants are dru gs that reduce a bodily functional activity or an instinctive desire.3 They include drugs such as barbiturates, morphine and other opioids, and tranquilizers. The lethal dose fo r morphine a nd other opioids is on ly 10 to 20 fold greater than the incapacitating dose. Ma jor tranquilizers often produce relatively little sedation, although they reduce hyp eractivity.22 (1) Cannabinols. Cannabinols are an other a group of potential incapacitating agents that seem to act basically as CNS de pressants. Primary effects of these a gents, however, are sedation a nd destru ction of motiv ation rather than disruption of the ability to think.1 (2) Phenothiazine-like com pounds have a very high safety index and would not likely involve any special medical care. The on set of action for phenothiazines is about 5 minutes an d often lasts about 1 hour. (3) Fentanyls. On 27 October 2002, Russi a used a derivative of fentanyl in a Moscow theatre where Chechen rebels held 80 0 hostages.23 Fentanyls are opiates with actions similar to those of morphine; in particula r, the capa city to relieve pain. Short-term and long-term effects of the fentanyls are indi stinguishable from thos e of heroin, but they are hundreds of times more potent.24 Fentanyls depress respiration a nd heart ra te and cause letha rgy, sedatio n, and immobilization.22 As a potential class of agents, they have a rapid onset of action. Decontamination wo uld involve washing with s oap and wa ter.1 e. Psychedelics. Psychedelics are drugs capable of producing abnormal psychological effects an d sometimes psycho logical states resembling m ental and indoles. Psyche delic drugs have been found unsuitable for military use. Affected individuals usually c annot carry o ut a series of instructions or concentrate on a complex task, but might be ca pable of is olated, impulsive actio ns such as firing a weapon accurately enough to be dangerous.22 f. Symptoms. Symptoms and possibl e agent families are shown in Table II-48 (page II-68). See documents such as FM 8-285 for diagnosis and treatment for incapacitati ng agents.

Chemical Warfare Agent Precursors10 These materials are not CW agents; th ey are binary agent components and are relatively nontoxic\u2014at least when compared with the CW agents. a. Methyl Phosphonic Acid (DF) (see Table II-49) . DF is an organophosphorous compound that is an in termediate component of binary GB. The Hu man Estimates Committee of what is now Edge wood Chemical and Biolog ical Center (ECBC) sta ted that many alkyl organophosphorous compounds produc e neurotoxicity in various anim al toxic sy ndrome includes weakn ess and para lysis, with death resulting from a central action. Deaths that occur within a few hour s of exposure, before the a ppearance of lung damage, ar e perhaps due to central respirator y failure. Deaths occurring after 2 4 hours postexposure are thought to result from l ung damage, central respirat ory failure, or a combination of the two.

Backgrou nd This chapter addresses military chemical com pounds including RCAs, respiratory irritants, smok e, obscurants, and incendiarie s. See Tabl e III-1 f or a list of the s elected military chemical com pounds discussed. Table III-1. List of Sele cted Military Chemical Compounds Synthetic Graph ite, Brass, Fog Oil [Smoke Gen erator Fuel s (SGF-2)], D , Oil and metal Incend iary Mixtures 2. Riot Control Agents (Tear-Producing Compounds) The RCAs a re chemicals that rapid ly produce s ensory irritation or disabling physical effects that disappear within a short ti me foll owing termination of ex posure.1 The standard tear-produc ing agents c urrently in the US in ventory for RCAs are o-chlorobenzyl idene (CS), other agents in the same family (CS1, CS2, CSX), and dibenz (b,f)-1:4-oxazepine (CR).2 Generally, they produce a rapid onset of effects (seconds to several minutes) and they have a relatively brief duration of effects (15 to 30 minutes) once the victim has escaped the contaminated atmosphere and has remo ved the contamination from clothing.3 Because tear compounds produce only transient casualties, they are wid ely used for training, riot control, and situations where long-term incapacitation is unacceptable. When used against poorly equipped fo rces, these compounds have proven ex tremely effective. When released indoors, they cause serious il lness or death .2 NOTE: Bleach react s with RCAs to form a strong irritant.3 Do not dec ontami nate RCAs with any form of bleach.2 a. Symptoms.3 Symptoms include an initial burning feeling or irritation to the eyes that progresses to pain accompanied by blepharospasm and lacrimation. The m ucous membranes of the mout h have a sensation of d iscomfort or burning, with excess salivation. Rhinorrhea is accompanied by pain inside the nose. Wh en inhaled, t hese compounds cause a burning sensation or a feeling of tightness in the chest, with coughi ng, sneezin g, and increased secretions. On unprote cted skin, espe cially if the air is warm and moist, these agents cause tingling or burning. b. Protection. The protective mask and ordinary f ield clothing secured at the neck, wrists, and ankles provide protection against field concentrations of RCAs.4 When handling and loading bulk CS, personnel sh ould wear prot ective clothing, masks, hoods, an d gloves.2 III-1 c. Toxicity. There are a n umber of different formulations an d methods of dispersion f or the RCAs, and the different sy stems/formulations impact the potency of the materials. The estimates recommended by the former Hu man Estimates Committee at what is now ECBC were often based upon the most potent formulation.5 d. O-Chlorobenzylidene Malononitrile (C S) (see Table III-2). In 1959, t he USA adopted CS for combat training and riot control purposes.2 CS produ ces an intense burning and irritati on of the ey es, with mild to severe conjunctivitis. It also produces a burning sensation in the nose a nd mucous membranes of the respiratory tract, followed b y draining of the nasal sinuses. The chest feels constri cted, with a sensation of c hoking and being unable to b reathe. CS is also a primary skin irritant, and can produce erythema, edema, and vesication.5 CS exi sts as a family of four for ms: CS, CS1, CS2, an d CSX. Different forms of CS have different persistence char acteristics because of their formulation, dissemination, and rate of hydrolysis.2 CS has been found to persist in snow for as long as 30 days but its persistency in soil varies, depending on the condition of the soil.6 See Table III-3 for CS toxicity estimates.

Unlike CS, CS1 is a free-flow ing agent powd er consisting of 95 perc ent crystalline CS blended with 5 percent silic a aerogel. This formulation reduces agglomeration, increases fluidity, and achi eves the desired respiratory effects when dispersed as a solid aer osol. Wh en disturbe d, CS1 reaerosolizes and can cause respiratory and eye effe cts. 2 (2) CS2 is a siliconized, microencapsulated form of CS1.3 This treatment improves the physical characteristi cs of CS by reducing agglomeration and hydrol ysis. This form of CS prolongs the effectiveness for both immediate and surface contamination effects.2 (3) CSX is a form of CS developed for d issemination as a liquid rather th an a powder. One gram of powdered CS is dissolved in 99 grams of trioctyl phosphite (TOF). As with CS, CSX stings a nd irritates the eyes , skin, nose, thr oat, and lungs of exposed personnel.2 e. Dibenz (b,f)-1:4-oxazepine (CR) (see Table III- 4 [page III- 4]). In 1974 , the USA approved the use of CR in riot control situation s.2 CR is more potent and less toxic than III-3 CS.3 CR is not used in its pure form but is dissolved in a solution of 80 parts of propylene glycol and 20 parts of water to form a 0.1 pe rcent CR solut ion. The severity of sy mptoms increases with the CR solution conc entration and in any environment of high temperature and humidity. CR does not degrade in water, and it is quite persistent in the environment. Under suitable conditions, CR can persist on certa in surfaces (especially porous) for up to 60 days.2 (See Table III-5) for CR toxicity est imates Table III-4.

DM, DA, and DC were previously called vomiting agents; however, their primary action is irritation of the respiratory tract. The y were originally desi gned as \"mask breakers\" d uring WWI. Their intended purpose was to penetrate the canist er, forcing tro ops to remove their masks and be exposed to more toxic materials.5 Two char acteristics make these compounds different than RCAs. The first characteristi c is that the effects do not appear immediately on exposure or seconds afterwards, bu t several mi nutes later. In the absence of symptoms, personnel will not mask immediatel y; by the ti me they mask, a significant amount of the compound will have been absorbed . The effects may then cause an in dividual to unmask. The second characterist ic of these compounds is that there may be more prolonged systemic effects\u2014such as headache, mental depression , chills, naus ea, abdomi nal cramps, vomiting, and diarrhea\u2014which la st for several hours after exposure.3 They are dispersed as aerosols, and they produce their effects by inhalation or by direct action on the eyes.

CA irritates the eyes and causes lacrimation.3 CA is too toxic for use as an RCA and is considered obsolete.11 5. Smokes, Obscurants, and Incendiaries Smok es, obscurants, and incendiaries are combat multipliers. Thei r use provides tactical advantages for offensive an d defensiv e operations. For example, smok e has long been employed as a means of concealing battlefie ld target s. Fire damage causes casualties and material damage and can impact psychologically.12 This section contains the physical and chemical properties of sel ected smok es, obscurants, and incendiaries. a. Smokes and Obscurants. Smoke is an ae rosol that owes its ability to conceal or obscure to i ts composition of many small particles suspend ed in the ai r. These particles scatter or absorb the li ght, thus re ducing visi bility. When the density or amount of smoke material between the observer and the object to be screened exceeds a certain minimum threshold value, the ob ject cannot be seen.12 Many types and combinations of s mokes are used, but the three basic types of screenin g smokes are hexachloroethane (HC) s moke, and fog oil oke.6 White phosphorous (WP) and H C are hygroscopic; they absorb water vapo r from the atmosphere. This increases their di ameters and mak es them more efficient at reflecting light ra ys. Fog oils are n onhygroscopic and depend upon vaporization techniques to produce extremely small diameter droplets to scatter light rays.12 Most smokes are not hazardous in con centrations that are useful for obscuring purposes. However, a ny smoke can be hazardous to health if the concentration is sufficient or if the exposure is l ong enough. The prot ective mask gives the respiratory tract and the eyes adequ ate protection against all smok es.4 CAUTI ON The protective mask mu st be worn when operating in or around smoke material. (1) Hexachloro ethane (HC). HC is a pyro technic containing an equal am ount of hexachloroethane an d zinc oxide, with ap proximately 7 percent gra ined alumin um. On combustion, the reaction products are zinc chloride and 10 percent p hane, hexachlorobenzene, hydrogen chloride, chlorine, and carbon monoxide. The toxicity of this chemical compound is gen erally attributed t o zinc chloride (ZnCl 2) (see Table III-17). The ZnCl 2 react s with the moisture in the air to form a grayis h white smoke. The more humid the air, the more dense the HC smoke.13 Immediately after exposure, symptoms in clude tightness in the chest, sore throat or hoarseness, and cough.4 Expos ures to very high doses of HC smoke commonly result in sudden, early collapse and death.13 III-16 CAUTI ON Hexachloroethane is a suspected carcinogen.10 Table 2 Chem name hloride erties Structural Form ula: Cl \u2014 Zn \u2014 C l Molecular Form ula: ZnCl 2 1 Molecu lar We ight: 136.3 1 Physical state Hygroscopic w hite solid 2 Odor Data not availa ble Boiling point 732\u00b0C (1350\u00b0 F) 1 FP/MP 290\u00b0C (554\u00b0 F) (MP) 1 dens ity (g/mL) Data not availa ble Vapor dens ity (relativ e to air) 4.7 (calculated) Vapor pressure (torr) Appr oximately 0 @ 20\u00b0C (68\u00b0F) not availa ble Spec ific grav ity (water = 1 @ 4\u00b0 C) 2.91 @ 25\u00b0C 1 Flash point Data not availa ble Decom posit ion temperature Data not availa ble Solubility In water, 432 g/100 mL at 25\u00b0C 2 Stability in stora ge Decom poses upon heatin g, producing tox ic fumes of h ydrogen chloride and z inc oxide 2 Action on meta ls or other materials The so lution in w ater is a medium-strong acid. 2 Other D ata Skin an d eye toxicity Corrosive to the e yes and the s kin 2 Inhalatio n tox icity Irritant; inhalatio n of fumes ma y cause lu ng ede ma 2 Protection requ ired Try to remain out of smoke/ obscurant clouds, a nd w ear protecti ve mask w hen making smo ke.

(2) Phosphorous. Phospho rous occurs in three all otropic forms: white, red, and black. The military uses white and red phosphorous. CAUTI ON Phosphorous smoke pro duces phosphoric acid must wear respiratory protection.14 phorous (WP) (see Tabl e III-18 [page III-18]). WP produces a hot, dense, white smok e composed of particles of phosphorous pentoxide, which are converted by moist air into phosphoric acid.4 WP is a very active chemical that will III-17 readily combine with oxygen in th e air, even at room temperature. As oxidation occurs, WP becomes lu minous and bursts into flames within minutes. Complete submersion in water is the only way to extinguish the flam es.13 It is used primarily as a smoke agent an d can also function as an antipersonnel flam e compound capable of causing serious burns.

RP smok e is deployed explosively from grenades and mortar s hells. The grenades consist of a 95 :5 mixture of RP and bu tyl rubber.15 RP is produced by heating WP to 270 to 300 degrees C in the absence of air. RP is more den se, has a hi gher melting point, is much less reactive, is essentially n ontoxic, and is easier and safer to handle than WP. When RP is heated, WP molecules sublime from the solid.16 RP will not ignite spontaneously and, ther efore, requires ignition to burn and make smoke.14 (3) Titanium Tetrachloride (FM Smoke) . FM smoke is a corrosive substance typically dispersed by spray or explosive mu nition s. It is extremely irritating a nd corrosiv e in both liqu id and smoke formulations. Expo sure to liquid may creat e burns similar to those of mi neral acids on conjunctiva or sk in. A dense, white smok e results from the decomposition of FM s moke into hydrochloric acid, titanium oxychloride, and titanium dioxide (TiO 2) (see Table III-19).13 TiO 2 is the major component of training smoke grenade XM82 and is also us ed in conjunction with H C in the production of white screeni ng smok e.6 Table III-19.

(4) Tantalum (Ta). Ta is a clear, colorless, odorless liquid. It is a mixture of tantalum pentachloride, hydrogen fluoride, a nd water. I t is stable a t 68 degrees F when stored and used under proper conditions. On heating to decomposition, it could yield toxic fumes of flu orides. It a ttacks glass and other silicon-containing compounds. It reacts with silica to produce silicon tetrafluoride, a hazardous , colorl ess gas. It i s incompatible with arsenic trioxide, phosphorus pentoxide, ammonia, calcium oxide, sodium hydro xide, sulfuric acid, vinyl acetate, ethylenediamine, acetic anhydride, a lkalis, organic materials, most common metals, rubber, leather, water, strong bases, carbonates, sulf ides, cyanides, oxides of silicon, a nd especiall y glass, concrete, silica, and fluorine. It is a corrosive poison. It is extremely hazardous in liquid and vapor form. It can cause severe b urns that m ay not be immediately painful or visible. It can be fa tal if swallowed or inhaled . Liquid and vapor can burn skin, eyes, an d the respiratory tra ct. It can also cause bone damage.17 (5) Synthetic Graphite (see Table III-2 0). Graphite is used as an obscurant to screen electromagnetic trac king an d targetin g systems. Graphite flakes perform well in obscuring mid- and far-infrared (IR) bands as we ll as a combination of visible, near-, mid-, and far-IR bands. Gra phite exists naturally and syntheti cally and is chemically inert.6 It consists primarily of carbon, with trace impuri ties totaling less than one percent of the total weight.18 Inhalation of dust can ca use nose a nd/or throat irritation and shortness of breath.19 Table III-20.

Brass in flak e or powder fo rm is one of the components of screening smoke grenade M76. Smoke munitions containi ng metal flak es or powders are used to screen against range finders, thermal surveill ance systems, and las er target de signators as well as to provide protection for armored vehicles. Smoke screens containing brass performed the best against far-IR bands but did poorly on visible light bands. Brass is a metal alloy composed mostly of copper ( 70 percent) and zinc (30 percent) with approximately 1 percent cont amination of trace metals.6 (7) Fog Oil (SGF-2). Fog oil is a low- viscosity petroleum o il used to generate screening smok es. The fog is generated by evap orating the hydrocarbons in the oil. Fog oil is composed of many different types of chemic als, but the predominant class of chemicals is aliphatic hydrocarbons with very low levels of noncarcinogenic aromatic hydrocarbons.6 Fog oil is th e overhead fraction of petroleum. It contains no additives and is not refined.20 Fog oil is commonly called smoke generator fu el number 2 (SGF-2) (s ee Table III-21). Table III-21.

DF-1 is clear or straw-colored liquid when undyed and low-sulfur diesel is red. Symptoms of overexposure include eye and sk in irritation, dermatitis, upper respiratory tract irritati on, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, lung damage, weakness, headache, confusion, b lurred visi on, drowsiness, dizzines s, slurred speech, flushed face, aortic plaques, he art beat irregularities, convulsions, unc onsciousnes s, and death.21 (9) Diesel Fuel No. 2 (DF-2). Symptoms of overexposure inclu de redness, drying to burns or blis tering of skin. Over exposure by inhalation can produce symptoms of intoxication such as headache, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, and loss of coordination.22 (10) Jet Fuel Grade (JP-8). High va por concentrati ons can be irritating to the eyes and respiratory tract, causing head aches, dizziness, anesthesia, drowsiness, unconscious ness, and CNS effects. Chronic exposure of the skin can ca use drying, defatting, a nd dermatitis.23 (11) Signaling Smok es. These smok es are produced by explosive dissemina tion of dyes. There are no reports of ill effects produced by exposure to these smokes.4 b. Incendiaries. The purpose of incendiaries is to cause maximum fire damage on flammable materials and objects and to illumi nate. The i nitial action of the incendiary munition may destroy t hese materials, or the spreading an d continuing of fires started by the incendiary may de stroy them.12 (1) Magnesium Incendiaries. Magnesi um is a soft metal, which when rai sed to its ignition temperature, spontaneously ignite s on contact with air or moisture, producing irritating or toxic fumes.24 Magnesium (Mg) burns at approximately 2000 degrees C with a scattering e ffect. Its particles prod uce deep burns. Healing is slow unless these p articles are removed quick ly. When explo sive char ges have been added, fragments may be embedded deep in the ti ssues, causi ng the localized formation of hydrogen gas and tissue necrosis.4 (2) Thermite and Thermat e Incendiari es. A thermite reaction occurs wh en powdered aluminum m etal and iron oxide mix. It is an ex othermic reaction in which the III-22 temperature rises to ab out 3000 degrees C, ca using the aluminum and iron to become a liquid.16 Explosive charges are frequently added. Particles of iron t hat lodge in the sk in produce multiple small, deep burns. The particl es should be cooled i mmediately with water and removed.4 (3) Oil and Metal Incendia ry Mixtures. Lung dam age from heat and irritating gases may be complications added to the injuries from inc endiaries, especially in confined spaces.4 NOTES 1USACHPPM TG 204, Glossa ry of Term s for N uclear, Biological, and Chemical Agents and Defen se Eq uipment , December 2001. a nd Herbi cide Operations , 19 August 199 6 (Renumbered from FM 3-11). 3BG Russ Z ajtchu k et al (eds), Textbook of Military Medi cine: Medical Aspec ts of Chemical and Biological Warfare , Office of the Surgeon General, 1997, Chap. 12, ties and Conven tional Military Chemical Injuries , 22 December 1995. 5Sharon Reutter, et al., Review and Recomme ndations for Human Toxicity Esti mate s for F M 3-11.9 , ECBC-TR-349, September 6USA Co Engin eering Research Labor atory, Methods for Field Studi es of the Effects of Military Smokes, Obscu of Intern ational Tas k Force-25: Hazard Fro m Toxic Industrial Chemicals, March 18, 1996. 9ICSC 0128 , \"2-Chloroacetophenone.\" 10US HHS, Public Health Service, National Toxicology Pro gram, 10th Report on Carcino gens, December Handbook on Medical Aspects of NBC Defen se Ope rations AMEDP-6( B), 1 February 1 996. 12FM 3-6/FMFM 7-11-H/AFM 105 -7, Field Behavior of NBC Agents (Including Smoke and Incendiarie s), 3 November 1986. 13BG Russ Zajtchu k, et al.

The information presented in this c hapter pr ovides descriptions of selected bacteria, ric kettsiae, vir uses, and toxins. b. The biologic al agents addressed in this chapter are presented in a standard format that includes the following information: (1) Infectious Agent. Identifies the spe cific pathogen that causes the dise ase, classifies the pathogen, and may indicate any of its important characteristics. (2) Occu rrence. Provides informatio n on where the disease is known to be prevalent and/or in what population gr oups it is most likely to occur. (3) Reservoir. Indicates the ultima te and/or intermediate human, anima l, arthropod, plant, soil, or substance (or a comb ination of t hese) in wh ich an infectious agent normally li ves and multiplies, on which it depends primarily for survival, and where it reproduces itself in suc h a manner that it can be transmitted to a susceptible hos t. IV-3 (4) Transmission.1 Descri bes the mec hanisms by which an infectious agent is spread to humans. Such mechanisms incl ude direct, indirect, and airborne. (a) Direct tran smission ca n be by direct contact (s uch as touching or biting), or by the direct projection (droplet sp read) of droplet spray ont o the conjunctiva or onto the mu cous membranes of the eye, nose, or mouth during sneezing, coughin g, spitting, singing, or talking (usually limited to a distance of about 1 meter or less). (b) Indirect tra nsmission c an be vehi cle- or vector- borne. Vehicle-borne transmission is when contaminated inanimate materials or objects (e.g., soiled clothes, cooking or eating utensils, water, or food ) serve as an intermediate means by which an infectious agent is tran sported and introduced into a susceptible host through a suitable portal of entry. Vector-borne transmission ca n be mechanical or biolog ical. Mechanical includes si mple mechanical carriage by a cra wling or flying insect through soilin g of its feet or proboscis, or by passage of organisms thro ugh its GI tract. This does not req uire multiplication or development of the organism. Biological means that the propaga tion (multiplication), cyclic developmen t, hese is requ ired before the arthropod can transmit the infective form of th e agent to humans. An incubation period is required following infection before the arthrop od becomes infective. (c) Airborne transmission is the di ssemination of microbial a erosols to a suitable por tal of entry\u2014usually the respirator y tra ct. Mi crobial aerosols are suspensions of particles in the air consisting partially or wholly of microorganisms. They may remain suspended in the air for long periods of time. (5) Symptoms. Describes the symptoms of the di sease. (6) Incubation period. Identifies the interval (in hours, days, or weeks) between initial, effective exposure to an in fectious organis m and the first appearance of symptoms of the infection. (7) Communicability. Describes the ti me (days, weeks, or months) during which an infectious agent may be transmitted, directly or indirectly, f rom an infected person to another person or from an infected animal to humans. (8) Prevention. Describes prophylaxis measures. (9) Delivery. Describes the most likely means to disseminate the agent. 2. Bacterial Agents of Potential Concern Bacteria are single-cell ed, microscopic or ganisms. These unicellular forms outnumber all other for ms of microorganisms. However, fe w bacteria are of milit ary significance. Of several thousand identified species , only about 100 are known to be pathogenic.2 Some bacteria th at infect man are select ive human parasites, but many are zoonotic, transmittab le from animals to hu mans. Zoon otic organisms include anthrax, tul aremia, and have primary m ilitary potential as antipersonnel agent s. a. Anthrax. (1) Infectious Agent. Bacillus anthracis . This organism forms a protective spore under adverse environmental conditions or upon exposure to ai r. When conditions improve, the spores germinate to produce vege tative bacte ria. The spores are extremely hardy and can survive extremes of te mperature, dryness, and floodin g.3 (2) Occu rrence. Worldwide.3 IV-4 (3) Reservoir. The soil an d domestic and wild animals (primarily herbivores, including g oats, sheep, cattle, horses, and swine) serve as reservoirs.4 (4) Transmission. Humans can contra ct anthra x from the inhalation of aerosolized spores, contact with inf ected animals (their hi des, wool, o r other products), or ingestion of contaminated meat. Usually, humans do not contrac t anthrax dire ctly from the soil.3 (5) Symptoms. Symptoms of anthrax depend upon the method of transmission. (a) Cutaneous anthrax fea tures a painless, necrotic ulcer with a black scab and local swelling.3 Untreated cutaneous anthrax ha s a case-fatality rate between 5 and 20 percent.1 (b) Ingestion causes oroph aryngea l and GI anthra x. Initial symptoms of oropharyngeal anthrax are fever, sore throat , and difficulty swallowi ng. Acute s ymptoms include ulcer or scab involving the hard palate or tonsils, s welling of n eck tissues, and abnormal enlargement of the lymph nodes. In itial symptoms of GI anthrax inclu de fever, loss of appetite, nausea , and vomiting. Abdo minal pain, bloody vomiting, bloody diarrhea, and possibl y massive abdominal s welling may follow. In both cases, septic shock and death may follow.3 (c) Initial sym ptoms of in halation an thrax are m ild and non specific and may include fever, mal aise, fatigue, and mild cough or ch est discomfort; acute symptoms of respiratory distress, fever, and shock follow, with death occurring shortly thereafter.1 (6) Incubation period. Hours to 7 da ys; although most cases occur withi n 48 hours post-exposure.2 Incubation periods up to 60 days are possible.1 (7) Communicability. Transmission from person to person is very rare. Articles and soil contaminated with sp ores may remain infective for decades.1 (8) Prevention. Anthrax vaccine is available.2 (9) Delivery. Missiles, bomblets, artille ry fires, point release, or airborne line release may deliver aerosoliz ed spores. Cont amination of food and water could also be tes.3 (2) Occu rrence. Worldwide.1 (3) Reservoir. Cattle, swine, goats, and sheep serve as reservoirs. Infection may occur i n bison, elk, caribou, and some spec ies of deer.1 Dogs and coyotes have been found to be infected. (4) Transmission. The dis ease is tran smitted by the inhalation of aerosols or dusts that contain organisms, ingestion of unp asteurized dairy products and contaminated meat, or inoculation of abraded skin or mucosal surfaces.3 (5) Symp toms. A bacterial diseas e with sudden or insidious onset, characteriz ed by continued, intermittent, or irregular fev er of variable duration; headache; weakness; profuse sweating; chills; severe pai n in especially one not infla mmatory in characte r; depression; weight loss; and ge neralized aching. The disease may last for IV-5 several days, months, or occasionally a year or more if not adequately treated. Th e untreated c ase-fatality rate is 2 percent or less. Some of the original s yndrome may reappear as relapses.1 (6) Incubation period. Varies from 5 days to 8 weeks, usually 2 to 8 weeks.3 (7) Communicability. This disease i s not communicable from person to person.3 (8) Prevention. Vaccines are not curre ntly available for huma n use. Pers onnel must avoid consuming unpasteurized dairy pro ducts or uncook ed foods containing the dairy products an d avoid cont act with sus pect infected animals.3 (9) Delivery. The primary threat is by aerosol release. A food-borne brucellosis attack is unlikel y, but could be executed.3 c. Cholera and other cholerae1 (2) Occu rrence. Worldwide.1 (3) Reservoir. Humans and some strains of bacteria found in aquatic environments, particul arly brac kish waters.1 (4) Transmission. Through ingestion of food or water contam inated directly or indirectly with feces or vomit of infected persons. Ingesti on of raw or undercook ed seafood from polluted waters h as caused outbreaks.1 (5) Symptoms. Symptoms include profuse painles s, watery stools; naus ea and vomiting; and (in untreated cases) rapid dehydrat ion, acidosis, and circulatory col lapse. In severe untreated cases death may occur withi n a few hours and the case-fatality rate may exceed 50 percent.1 (6) Incubation period. From a few hours to 5 days, usually 2 to 3 days.1 (7) Communicability. Transmission is negligible fr om person to person.6 Occasionally the carrie r state may persist for several months, but usually only a few days after recove ry.1 (8) Prevention. Following proper field sanitation and personal hygiene are useful preventive meas ures. Do not eat raw se afood. A vaccine is available.1 (9) Delivery. The primary threat is from contamination of food and water supplies an d secondly by aerosol s pray.5 d. Glanders. (1) Occu rrence. The diseas e is not widespread. The cases ha ve been am ong workers with jobs that involve horses, do nkeys, or mules and laboratory wor kers.3 Cases continue to occur in Asia, Africa, th e Middle East, and Central and So uth America.6 (3) Reservoir. Horses, mules, and donkeys serve as reservoirs.3 (4) Transmission. The organism is transmitted from animals to humans by invading th e nasal, ora l, and mucous membranes around the eyes; by inhaling in to the lungs; and by invading abraded or lacerated skin.3 IV-6 (5) Symptoms. Symptoms include fe ver, rigors, sweating, muscle pain, headache, pleuritis, chest pain, and generalized papular/pustular eruptions.3 Mortality rate is over 50 percent despite antibiotic treatment.7 (6) Incubation period. 10 to 14 days after inhalation.3 (7) Communicability. Cases of person- to-person transmission have been reported.6 (8) Prevention. No vaccine is available.3 (9) Delivery. The primary threat is aerosol relea se.3 e. Melioidosis. rrence. countries betw een 20 degrees north and south latitudes.3 (3) Reservoir. Soil and water are th e reservoirs. Several animals including sheep, goats, horses, s wine, monk eys, and rode nts, can become infec ted. There is no evidence that animals are important reservoirs except tha t they sprea d the agent to new soil and water.3 (4) Transmission. Contact with conta minated soil or water through gros s or unapparent skin lesion s, aspiration or ingest ion of contaminated water, or inhalation of contaminated dust.3 (5) Symptoms. Melioid osis will most li kely present as an acute pulmonary infection ranging from mild bronchitis to se vere pneumoni a. Other symptoms may include fever (over 102 degrees F), headache, loss of appetite, and pain in one or more muscles. Acute pulm onary disease can progress into a ra pidly fatal septicemic disease. Th e case- fatality rate for acute septicem ic disease exceed s 90 percent.3 (6) Incubation period. 10 to 14 days following inhalation.3 (7) Communicability. Person-to-person transmission has not been proven. Laboratory acquired infections are uncommon, but do occur, especially if procedures produce aerosols.3 (8) Prevention. No vaccines are available.3 (9) Delivery. The primary threat is aerosol relea se.3 f. Plague. (2) Occu rrence. Worldwide.8 Plague continues to be a threat because of v ast areas of persistent wild rodent infection.1 (3) Reservoir. The primar y reservoi r is wild rodents (especially ground squirrels). Domestic cats, wild carnivores, rabbits, and hares can also transmit plague to humans.1 (4) Transmission. The dis ease is tran smitted from infected fleas\u2014eithe r from rodents to humans, from dogs or cats to humans, or from person to person\u2014and by handling tissues of inf ected animals.1 In the most likely BW scenario, plague would be IV-7 spread via aerosol. A r apidly pers on-to-pe rson spread of fulminant pneumonia would occur.8 Cat bites or scratches may also transmit plague.1 (5) Symptoms. Initial sign s and symp toms may be nonspecific with fever , chills, mala ise, muscul ar pain, nausea, exhau stion, sore t hroat, and headache. This is bubonic plague, and it occurs more often in lymph nodes. The involved nodes become swollen, inf lamed, and tender and may form or discharge pus. Fever is usually p resent. Untreated bubonic plague has a case-fatality ra te of abou t 50 to 60 percent. Untreated primary septicemic plague and pneumonic plag ue are invariably fatal. Modern therapy markedly reduces fatality from bubonic plague ; pneumon ic and septicemic plagues also respond if recognized and treated early. Ho wever, patients who do not receive adequate therapy for primary pn eumonic plague within 18 hours after onset of respiratory symptoms are not likely to surviv e.1 (6) Incubation period. From 1 to 7 days, maybe a few days longer for an immunized individual. For primary plague pneumonia, 1 to 4 days, usually short.1 (7) Communicability. Flea s may remain infective for months under suitable conditions of temperatu re and humidity. Bubo nic plague is not usual ly transmitt ed directly from person to person unless there is contact with pus from suppurating buboes. Pneumonic plague may be imatic conditions; overcrowdi ng facilitates transmission.1 Fleas flourish at humidity ju st above 65 percent and temperatures between 20 to 26 degrees C, and can survive 6 months without a feeding.8 (8) Prevention. Use of ins ect repellen ts, approve d for human use, will provide a level of pr otection from bites by infected fl eas. A vaccin e is available to prevent bubonic plague.3 (9) Delivery. The primary threat is by aerosol release or by contamination of food and water.3 g. Psittacosis. (1) Infectious rrence. Worldwide.1 Reservoir. Parakeets, parrots, pi geons, turkeys, ducks, a nd other birds serve as reservoirs. Ap parently healthy bird s can be carri ers and occasionally shed the infectious agent, partic ularly when subjected to the stresses of crowding and shipping.1 (4) Transmission. Infection is acquired by inhaling dried dro ppings, secretions, and dust from infected feathers of birds. Hous ehold bird s, usually psittacine birds, are the most frequent source of exposure, followed by turkey, squa b, and duck farms and in poultry processing plants.1 (5) Symptoms. In humans , fever, headache, rash, muscle pai n, chills, an d upper or lower respira tory tra ct disease are co mmon. Res piratory symptoms are mild when compared with the extensive pneumonia confirmed by X-ray.1 Before antimicrobial agents were available, 15 to 2 0 percent of persons with C. psi ttaci infection were report ed to have died.9 (6) Incubation period. From 1 to 4 weeks.1 IV-8 (7) Communicability. Rare person-to- person transmission has been reported. Diseased as well as seemingly healthy bird s may shed the agent intermittently, and sometimes continuously, for weeks or months.1 (8) Prevention. No vaccine is available.5 (9) Delivery. The primary threat is from aerosol r elease.5 h. Shigellosis ( Bacillary dysentery). (1) Infectious Agent. The genus Shigel la (S.) is comprised of four species: Group A, S. dysente riae; Group B, S. flexneri , Group C, S. boydii , and Group D, sonnei .1 (2) Occu rrence. Worldwide.1 (3) Reservoir. Man; however, so me outbreaks ha ve occurred in primate colonies.1 (4) Transmission. Transmission i s mainly by direct or indirect fecal-oral transmission from a patient or car rier. Infecti on may occur after the ingestion of very few (10 to 100) organisms. Individuals primarily responsible f or transmission are those who fail to clean hands and under fingernails thoroughly after defecation. They may then spread infection to others directly by physical contact or i ndirectly by contaminating food. Water and milk trans mission may occur as t he result of direct fecal contamination; flies can transfer organisms from latrines to uncovered food items.1 (5) Symptoms. Symptoms involve the large and distal small i ntestine, characterized by diarrhea accompanied by fe ver, nausea, and sometimes toxemia, vomiting, cramps, an d tenesmus. In typical cases, th e stools contain blood, an d mucus (dysentery); however, many cases present with a watery di arrhea. S. dysente riae 1 is often as sociated with serious disease. Case-fatality rate s have been as h igh as 20 percent among hospitalized cases even in recent years.1 (6) Incubation period. From 12 to 96 hours (usually 1 to 3 days) up to 1 week for S. Dysen teriae 1.1 (7) Communicability. During acute infection and until the inf ectious agent is no longer present in the feces, usu ally within 4 weeks after illness .1 (8) Prevention. Follow proper personal hygiene and field san itation procedures.1 (9) Delivery. The primary threat woul d be contamination of food and water supplies. i. Tularemia. (1) Infectious Agent. Fran cisell A ( F. tularen sis biovar tularensi and type B ( F. tularensi s biovar palaerctica ).1 The type A strain is highly viru lent. Ten virulent organisms injected subcutaneously and 10 to 50 organisms given by aerosol can cause inf ection Tularemia occurs thro ughout North America and in many parts of continental Europe, the former Soviet Union, China, and Japan.1 IV-9 (3) Reservoir. This organism is maint ained in nu merous and diverse mammalian (rabbits, hares, and rodents) and tick reservoi rs.3 In addition, a rodent- mosquito cycle has been described.1 (4) Transmission. Transmission is through the bite of arthropods (ticks a nd deerflies, al so mosquito es in Sweden, Finl and, and Russia), direct cont act with aerosols gener ated by ski nning/pro cessing infected animals, and ingestion of contaminated food or water.3 (5) Symp toms. This bacterial disease has a variety of clinical manifestations related to the route of introduction and the vir ulence of th e disease agent. Most o ften it presents itself as an ulc er at the site of intro duction of the organism, together with swelling of the regional lymph nodes. There may be no apparent primary ulce r, but only one or more enlarged and painful lymph nodes. Ingestion of organisms in contaminated food or water may produce painful ph aryngitis, a bdominal pa in, diarrhea, and vomiting. Inhalation of infectious material may be follow ed by pneu monic involvement with a 30 to 60 percent case-fatality rate if unt reated. Typ e A has a 5 to 15 percent untreate d case-fatality rate, and type B produces few fatalities even without treatmen t.1 (6) Incubation period. Related to viru lence of inf ecting strain and to size of inoculum; the range is 1 to 14 days (usually 3 to 5 days).1 (7) Communicability. Not directly tran smitted from person to person. Unless treated, the infectious agent may be found in the blood d uring the first 2 week s of disease and in lesi ons for a month, someti mes longer. Flies can be infective for 14 days and ticks throughout their lifetime (about 2 years). R abbit meat frozen at -15 degrees C (5 degrees F) has remained infective longer than 3 years.1 (8) Prevention. The protective mask provides protection of the respiratory tract from exposure to aerosol org anisms. All food must be thorough ly cooked to kill any organisms before cons umption. Water must be thoroughly disinfected before consumption. A live attenuated vacci ne is availa ble.3 (9) Delivery. The primary threat is by aerosol release or by contamination of food or water supplies.3 j. Typhoid Fever. (1) Infectious Agent. Salm onella typhi (2) Occu rrence. Worldwide. The annual incidence of typhoid fever is estimated at about 17 million cas es with approximately 600 thousand deaths.1 (3) Reservoir. Man.1 (4) Transmission. Transmission is by food and water contaminated by feces and urine of patients and carriers. Important vehicles in some parts of the world include shellfish ta ken from sewage-conta minated beds (particul arly oysters ), raw fruits , vegetables fertilized by human excrement and eaten raw, and contaminated milk and milk products. Flies may i nfect foods where the organisms then multiply and achieve an infecti ve dose.1 (5) Symptoms. Systemic b acterial dise ases characterized by insidious onset of sustained fever, severe headache, malaise, loss of appetite, a relative bradyca rdia, enlargemen t of the sple en, rose spo ts on the trunk, nonproductive cough, and constipation. Prior to ant ibiotics the case-fa tality rate was 10 to 20 percent.1 IV-10 (6) Incubation period. The incubation period depends on the s ize of the infecting dose; range is from 3 days to 1 month and usually between 8 to 14 days.1 (7) Communicability. Person-to-person transmission is poss ible. The period of communicability is as l ong as the bacilli appea r in excreta, usually from the first week throughout convalescence; variable thereafter. About 10 percent of unt reated typh oid fever patients will discharge bacilli for 3 months afte r the onset of symptoms, and 2 to 5 percent become permanent car riers.1 (8) Prevention. Following proper field sanitation and personal hygiene are useful preventive meas ures. A vaccine is available.1 (9) Delivery. The primary threat is from the sabotage of food and water supplies an d, secondly, by aerosol.5 3. Rickettsiae of Potential Concern The rickettsiae are int racellular, para sitic microorganisms that are considered intermediate in size between the bacteria and v iruses. They resemble the bacteria in their shape and resemble the viruses in their stri ct growth requi rements for living host cells. Most ricket tsiae are parasites, primarily of lower animals and arthr opods. Rickettsiae are transmitted to man and animals by vectors such as ticks, lice, fleas, an d mites. The rickettsiae have a selec tive affinity for spec ific types of cells of the hu man and animal bodies. As they require living tissue for reproduction, they are considered parasites.2 Usually, they are easil y killed by heat, dehydration, or disinfectants. a. Query ( Q) Fever. (1) Infectious Agent. Coxiella burnetii (C. burnetii). Despite the fact tha t C. burnetii is unable to grow or replicate outside host cells, t here is a sp orelike form of the organism that is extremely resistant to he at, pressure, desiccation, and many standard antiseptic compounds; this allows the organi sm to persist in the environment for long periods (week s or months) under harsh conditions.11 (2) Occu rrence. Worldwide.3 (3) Reservoir. Sheep, goats, cattle, dogs, cats, some wild mammals, birds, and ticks serve as reservoirs. Infected animals us ually do not develop the disease, bu t shed large numbers of organism in placental tissues and body fluids.1 (4) Transmission. The organism is hi ghly comm unicable by aerosol. A s ingle viable organism is en ough to cause infection in humans.3 It is commonly transmitted by airborne dis semination of coxiellae in dust from premises contaminated by placental tissues, birth fluids, and excreta of infected ani mals; in establishmen ts processing infected animals or their bypro ducts; and i n necrops y rooms. Airborne particles containing organisms may be carried downwind for a cons iderable distance (one-half mile or more); also by direct contac t with infected animals an d other contaminated materials such as wool, straw, fertil izer, and laundry. Ra w milk fro m infected cows contains organisms and may be responsible for some ca ses, but this has not been proven. Direct transmission by blood or marrow t ransfusion has been reported.1 (5) Symptoms. Symptoms include fever, fatigue, chills, sweat s, muscular pain, and severe headache in 75 percent of cases.3 The case-fatality rate in untreated acute cases is usually less than 1 percent, but h as been rep orted as high as 2.4 percent.1 IV-11 (6) Incubation period. Varies from 10 to 40 days and depends on the size of the infecting dose.11 (7) Communicability. Direct transmis sion from p erson to person occurs rarely, if ever. H owever, contaminated clot hing may be a source of infection.1 Coxiella organisms may persist in the envi ronment and produce infection for week s or months.11 (8) Prevention. The milita ry protec tive mask provides protection from aerosols. C onsume on ly pasteurized dairy pr oducts, and heat all foods sufficien tly to destroy the organisms (see TB MED 530 for food preparation guidelin es). An investigational vaccine is being tes ted.11 (9) Delivery. The primary threat is by aerosol or through contamination of food.3 b. Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever. (1) Infectious Agent. Ricke ttsia rickettsii.1 (2) Occu rrence. Infection h as been doc umented throughout th e US, in Canada, western and central M exico, Panama, Costa Rica, Colombia, Argentina, and Bra zil.1 (3) Reservoir. Maintained in nature in ticks. Th e rickettsia e can be transmitted to dogs, various rodents, and othe r animals. Disease in r odents and dogs have been obs erved.1 (4) Transmission. Transmission i s ordinarily from the bite of an infected tick. At least 4 to 6 hours of attachmen t and feedin g on blood by the tick a re required before the rickettsiae become reactivated and infectious for people. Contamination of brea ks in the skin or mucous membr anes with crushed tissues or feces of the tick may also lead to infection.1 (5) Symptoms. This diseas e is chara cterized by sudden onset of moderate to high fever (which ordin arily persists 2 to 3 weeks in untreated cases), significant malaise, deep muscle pain, severe headache, and chills. A rash generally appears on the extremities on about the third to fifth day; this soon in cludes the palm s and soles and spreads rapidly to much of the body. The fatality rate ranges between 13 to 25 percent in the absence of specific therapy.1 (6) Incubation period. From 3 to abou t 14 days.1 (7) Communicability. Not directly transmi tted from person to person. T he tick remains inf ective for life, commonly as long as 18 months.1 (8) Prevention. Measures that can be taken to re duce the opportunity fo r exposure include good field sanitati on and use of insect repellents. N o vaccine is available.1 (9) Delivery. The primary threat wo uld be from aerosol or from infected vectors.5 c. Trench Fever. (1) Quin tana).1 organism probably can be found whereve r the human body louse exists. Epidemics occurred in Eu rope during World Wars I and II am ong troops and prisoners of war living in crowded, unhygi enic conditions.1 IV-12 (3) Reservoir. Humans serve as reserv oirs; the intermediate host and vector is the body louse, Pediculus humanus corporis. The organism multiplies extracellularly in the gut lumen for the duration of the in sect's life, which is approximately 5 week s after hatching.1 (4) Transmission. The bo dy louse is i nfected by feeding on the blood of an infected pat ient. The infected louse excrete ric kettsiae in their feces and usually defecate at the time of feeding; peo ple are infe cted by rubb ing feces or crushed lice into the bite or into superficial abrasions.1 (5) Symp toms. Trench Fev er is typica lly a nonfatal, bacterial disease varying in manifest ations and severity. It is char acterized by headache, malaise, and pa in and tenderness\u2014especially on the shin s. Onset is either sudden or slow, with a fever that may be relapsin g, typhoid-li ke, or limited to a single episod e lasting for several days.1 (6) Incubation period. Generally 7 to 30 days.1 (7) Communicability. Not directly transmitted from person to person. Organisms may circula te in the blood (by whic h lice are in fected) for week s, months, or years and may recur with or without symptoms.1 (8) Prevention. Delousing procedures will destroy the vector and prevent transmission to man. Dust clothi ng and body with an ef fective insecticide.1 Washing sheets and clothing in hot water will el iminat e the lous e. Good hygiene will help prevent this condition. (9) Delivery. The primary threat woul d be by aerosol release or infected vector. d. Typhus Fever (Epidemic Louse-Borne Typhus Fever). (1) Infectious Agent. Ricke ttsia prowazekii.1 (2) Occu rrence. In colder areas where people may live under unhygienic conditions a nd are lous e-infested; enormous and explosive epidemics may occur during war and famine.1 (3) Reservoir. Humans ar e the reserv oirs and are responsible for maintaining the infection between epidemic periods.1 (4) Transmission. The body louse, Pediculus hu manus corp oris, is infected by feeding on the blood of a patient with acute typ hus fever. Infected lice excrete ric kettsiae in their feces and usually defecate at the time of feeding. People are inf ected by ru bbing feces or crushed lice into the bite or into superficia l abrasions. Inhalation of infective louse feces in dust may account for some inf ections.1 (5) Symptoms. Symptoms have variable onsets, often are sudden, and are marked by headache, chills, exhau stion, fever, and general pains. A macular eruption appears on the fifth to sixth day, i nitially on the upper tr unk, followed by spreading to the entire body (but usually not to the face, pal ms, or soles). T he case-fatality rate increases with age an d varies from 10 to 40 percent in the absence of specific therapy.1 (6) Incubation period. From 1 to 2 weeks, commonly 12 days.1 (7) Communicability. No direct person -to-person transmission. Patients are infective for lice during the febrile i llness and possibly for 2 to 3 days after the temperature returns to normal. Infected lice pass rickettsi ae in their feces within 2 to 6 days after the IV-13 blood meal; it is infective earlier if c rushed. The louse invariably dies within 2 weeks after infection; rickettsiae m ay remain viable in the dead louse for weeks.1 (8) Prevention. Dust clothing and body with an ef fective insecticide.1 No vaccine is available.5 Washing sheets and clothing in hot water will eliminate t he lous e. Good hygiene will help prevent thi s condition. (9) Delivery. The primary threat wo uld be by aerosol relea se or infected vectors.5 4. Viral Agents of Pote ntial Concern The groups of microorganisms call ed viruses are all parasites that live in the cell s of their selected hosts. Viruses cause about 60 perce nt of all infectious diseases. Once a viru s enters a livi ng cell, it is capable of replicatin g itself by taking over the metabolic processes of the invaded cell. Cells infected with viru ses show one of the foll owing respo nses: degeneration and death, transformation to a nonfunctioning state, or survival without transformation but with the evidence of the presence of o ne or more viral components. Diseases of viral origin do not re spond to treatment with antibiotics.2 Viruses have primary military potential as an tipersonnel agents. a. Chikungun ya Virus Di sease. (1) ( alphav irus).1 (2) Occu rrence. This virus is found in Africa, India, southeas t Asia, and the Philippine Islands.1 (3) Reservoir. The reservoir is unknown for most viruses. An insect (mosquito) reservoir is a possibility.1 (4) Transmission. Mosqui toes transmit the virus.1 (5) Symptoms. The usual onset of sy mptoms is characterize d by arthal gia (severe pain in a joint, especially one not infl ammatory) or arthritis, primarily in the wrist, knee, ankle, and small joints of the extremities, which lasts from days to months. Rashes are common. Polyarth ritis is a characterist ic feature. Minor hemorrhages have been attributed t o this virus.1 (6) Incubation period: From 3 to 11 days.1 (7) Communicability.

In nature, hares, birds and ticks in Eurasia and South Africa are believed to be reser voirs; re servoir hosts remain undefined in tropical Africa, but ticks, IV-14 insectivores, and rodents may be involved. Do mestic animals (sheep , goats, and cattle) may act as amplifying hosts.1 (4) Transmission. Transmission i s by a bi te of infective adult ticks. Immature ticks are believed to acquire infection fr om the animal hosts and by transovarian transmission. Transmission from patients to medical workers after exposure to blood and secretions has been important in recent outbre aks. Infection is als o associated with butchering infected animals.1 (5) Symptoms. This is a di sease with sudden ons et of fever, malaise, weakness, irritability, headache, severe pain in limbs and loins, and marked anorexia. Vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea occu r occasionally . Flush on face and chest develops ea rly. There may be som e bleeding f rom gums, nose, lungs, uterus, and intestine, but in large amounts only in serious or fatal ca ses. Fever is constantly elevated for 5 to 12 days. The r eported case fatality rate ranges fr om 2 to 50 percent.1 (6) Incubation period. Range is from 1 to 12 days, usually 1 to 3 days.1 (7) Communicability.

The EEE i s recognized in eastern and north c entral US, Canada, Central and South America, and the Caribbean islands; WEE occurs in western and central US, Canada , and parts of South America. The JE occurs in western Pacific islands from Japan to the Philippines.1 (3) Reservoir. The true reservoir or means of winter carr yover for these viruses is u nknown\u2014possibly birds, rodents, bats, reptiles, and/or amphibians; or it survives in mosquito eg gs or adult mosqui toes, with the mechanisms probably differing in each virus.1 (4) Transmission. Transmission i s from the bite of infective mosquitoes.1 (5) Symptoms. Symptoms of these dis eases are similar, but vary in severity and rate of progress. A large percentage of pa tients with v ector-borne infections are either asymptomatic or present with a nonspecifi c febrile il lness or aseptic meningitis.12 Severe infections a re usually marked by acute onset, headache, high fever, stupor, disorientation, coma, tremors, occasional convulsions, and spas tic (but r arely flaccid) paralysis. Case- fatality rate s range from 0.3 to 60 percent (JE and EEE a mong the highest).1 (6) Incubation period. Usually 5 to 15 days.1 (7) Communicability. Not directly transmi tted from person to person. Virus is not usually demonstrable in the blood of huma ns after onset of the dis ease. Mos quitoes remain infective for life. Viremia in birds usua lly lasts 2 to 5 days, but may be prolonged in bats, reptiles, and amphibians, particularly if interrupted by hibernation. Humans and horses are uncommon sources of mosquito in fection.1 (8) Prevention. Use screening, prote ctive clothing, and repellents, and try to eliminate b reeding gro unds.

The infected house mouse is the natural reservoir.1 (4) Transmission. Virus is excreted in urine, saliv a, and feces of infected animals\u2014usually mice. Transmission to huma ns is probably through oral or respiratory contact with virus-cont aminated excreta, food , or dust or by contaminatio n of skin lesi ons or cuts.1 (5) Symptoms. This diseas e is a viral i nfection of animals, es pecially mice, transmissible to human s, with a marked diversit y of clinical manifest ations. At times, there may be influenza- like symptoms, with my algia and headache. The acute course is usually short, ver y rarely fatal.1 (6) Incubation period. Probably 8 to 13 days, 15 to 21 days until meningeal symptoms appear.1 (7) Communicability. Transmission from person to person has not been demonstrated and is unlikely. Infected female mice transmit infection to the offspring, which become asymptomatic persistent viral shedders.1 (8) Prevention. Field hygiene and personal hygie ne are effec tive individual measures.1 (9) Delivery. The primary threat wo uld be delivery from an aerosol relea se. k. Monkeypox. (1) Infectious Agent.

Limited data on the transmission of m onkeypox virus are available from studies conducted i n Africa. Person-to-person transmission i s believed to occur prima rily throug h direct con tact and als o by respiratory droplet spread. Airborne transmission cannot be excluded, especially in patients presenting with cough.17 IV-19 (5) Symptoms. In humans , the symptoms are sim ilar to those of smallpox , but usually milder. The illness begins with fever, headache, muscle aches, backach e, swollen lymph nodes, a general feeling of d iscomfort, and exhaustion. A papular rash develops, often first on the face. The lesions usually develop through several stages before crusting and falling off. In Africa, the repo rted case-fatality rate is 10 percent.15 (6) Incubation period. About 12 days.15 (7) Communicability. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) suggests there is a rela tively low ri sk of person-to-person transmissio n.17 (8) Prevention. Because the monkeypox virus is related to the virus that causes smal lpox, the smallpox vaccine can prot ect people from getting monk eypox as well as smallpox .18 (9) Delivery. The likely method of dis semination is an aerosol release. l. Rift Valley Fever (RVF ). (1) Infectious (2) Occu This virus is found in Africa.1 (3) Reservoir. Unknown.1 (4) Transmission. Mosquitoes transmit the virus. Many human infections of RVF are as sociated with handling infective mate rial of a nimal tissu es during autopsy and butchering. Mechanical transmission by flies a nd transmission by aer osols or contact with highly infective blood may contrib ute to the e xplosive nature of RVF outbreak s.1 (5) Symptoms. The usual onset is fev er, headache, malais e, arthralgia, myalgia, occasional na usea to 12 days.1 (7) Communicability. No direct pe rson-to-person transmission. Infected mosquitoes probably transmit the virus throu ghout life. Epidemics may involve thousands of people.1 (8) Prevention. Insecticides, field sani tation, and personal hygiene are examples of preventive measures. Precautions in the care and handling of infected animals and their pr oducts are important.1 A vaccine is available.5 (9) Delivery. The likely method of dis semination is aerosol or through infected vectors.5 m. Smallpox. In response to concerns that variola stock s may by needed for counterterr orism research in the event that cl andestine s tocks held by other countries fall into terrorist hands, the World Health Assemb ly (WHA), in May 1999, authorized that the virus be held at laboratories in the US and Rus sia until no later than 2002. The World Health Organization (WHO) reaffirmed that destruction of all the remaining virus stocks is still the organization's ultimate goal and will appoint a group of experts to consider what research needs to be carried out before the vi rus can be destroyed. The WHO wi ll also set up an inspection schedule for the two laboratories where the official s tocks are k ept to mak e sure that th ey are secure and that r esearch can be carried out safely.1 IV-20 (1) Infectious Agent. Variola virus, a species of Orthopoxvirus.1 (2) Occu rrence. Formerly, smallpox was a worldwide disease. The last naturally acquired case of smallp ox occurred in October 1 977 in Somalia; global eradication was certified two years later by the WHO and sanctioned by the WHA in May 1980.1 (3) Reservoir. Humans we re the only natural reservoir of variola. All known variola virus stocks are held under security at the CDC, Atlanta, Georgia, or the State Research C enter (SRC) of Virology and Bi otechnology, Koltsovo, Novosibirsk Region, Russian Federation (RF).3 (4) Transmission. Usually by respirat ory droplet transmissio n, following close face-to-face contact. S mallpox was also trans mitted by d irect contac t with skin lesions or drainage, or with contaminated objects. Al though uncommon, airborne transmission (long- distance) also occurred.3 (5) Symptoms. Smallpox was a systemic viral disease that generally presented with a char acteristic s kin eruption. Onset was sudden, with fever, malaise, h eadache, prostration, severe backache, and occasional abdominal pain and vomiting\u2014a clinical picture that resembled influenza. After 2 to 4 days, the fever began to fall and a deep- seated rash developed in which individual lesions contain ing infectious virus progressed through successive stages of macul es, papules, vesicles, pu stules, and crusted sca bs, which fell off after 3 to 4 weeks. The lesions were first evident on the face and extremiti es and subsequentl y on the trunk . Two epidemiol ogic types of smallpox were recognized during the twentieth century: variola minor (alastri m), which h ad a case-fatality rate of less than 1 percent, and variola major (ordinary) with a fatality ra te among unvaccinated populations of 20 to 40 percent or more. Fatalities normally occurred in 5 to 7 days, occasionally as late as the seco nd week .1 (6) Incubation period. From 7 to 19 days; commonly 10 to 14 days to onset of illness and 2 to 4 days more to ons et of rash.1 (7) Communicability. Smallpox is very contagious from the time of developmen t of the earliest lesi ons to disa ppearance of all scabs\u2014about 3 weeks. The patient is most contagious during the pre-erup tive period by aerosol droplets from lesions.1 (8) Prevention. There are no routine i mmunizations of US forces for smal lpox. When the threat indicates, senior leadersh ip may direct vaccination of personnel with vaccinia.3 (9) Delivery. The primary threat is delivery by aerosol relea se.3 n.

During out breaks, VE E virus is tr ansmitted in a cycle involving horses\u2014which serve as the major source of th e virus\u2014to mosquitoes, which in tu rn infect humans. Humans also serve as hosts in a human-to-mosquito-to-human transmission cycle.1 (4) Transmission. By the bite of an in fected mosquito; laboratory infections by aerosol are common.1 IV-21 (5) Symptoms. Clinical manifestation s of this viral infection are influenz a-like, with an abrupt onset of severe hea dache, chills , fever, myalgia, retro-orbital pain, nausea, and vomiting. Most infections are relatively m ild, with symptoms lasting from 3 to 5 days. There may be CNS involvement ranging from somnolence to disorient ation, convulsions, paralysis, coma, and death.1 (6) Incubation period. Usually 2 to 6 days, can b e as short a s 1 day.1 (7) Communicability. Low risk of person-to-person transmission.5 Infected humans and horses are infectious for mosquitoes for up to 72 hours; infected mosquitoes probably transmit the virus throu ghout life.1 (8) Prevention. Use general mosquito control procedures.1 Vaccine is available.5 (9) Delivery. The primary threat is by aerosol release or through infected vectors.5 o. Yellow Fever. (1) Infectious Agent. Yellow Fever Vir us of the genus Flavivi rus.1 (2) Occu rrence. Sylvatic type: tropical regions of and L atin America. Urban type: North, Cen tral, and So uth America, and Trinidad.1 (3) Reservoir. Sylvati c: vertebr ates other than humans\u2014mainly possibly ma mosquitoes. Urban: humans and mosquitoes.1 (4) Transmission. Sylvati c: from infecti ve monkey to mosquito to man. Urban: from the bite of an infec tive mosqui Symp toms. Typical att ch aracterized by a sudden onset of fev er, chills, head ache, backa che, generalized muscle pain, prostration, nausea, and vomiting. Jaundice is moderate early in the disease and is intensified later.1 (6) Incubation period. From 3 to 6 days.1 (7) No person-to-person transmission.5 Blood of pati ents is infective for mosquitoes shortly before onset of fever and for the first 3 to 5 days of illness. The disease is highly communicable where many susceptible people a nd abundant vector mosquitoes co-exist. The incubation period in mosquitoes is commonly 9 to 12 days at the usual tropical temperatures. Once infe cted, mosquitoes remain so for life.1 (8) Prevention. A vaccine is available.5 (9) Delivery. The likely method of dis semination is aerosol.5 5. Toxins of Potential Concern Toxins are poisonous b yproducts of livin g organisms. They are very s table and produce severe illn ess when ingested, inhaled , or introduced into the body by any other means. Some toxins are susceptible to heat, while others are heat-stable. Their effects on the human body range from minor illness to death.3 a. Botulinum Toxins. (1) Toxin Origi n. Botulinum toxins ar e a group of seven toxins produced by Clostridium (C.) botulin um. The spores are ubiquitous; they germinate to give rise to IV-22 vegetative bacteria th at produce toxi ns for use as a BW agent. There are three forms of naturally occurring botulism\u2014food-bor ne, infantile, and wound. Botulinum toxin is the most potent neurotoxin k nown.3 (2) Occu rrence. Worldwide.1 (3) Reservoir. The reservoirs are soil, animals, an d fish. The organisms can be recovered fr om honey and other ag riculture products. H igh-risk foods are primarily improperly canned foods and dried meat or fish .3 (4) Transmission. Transmission is from consumption of contaminated food or contamination of a wou nd by groun d-in soil or gravel.1 (5) Symptoms. The autonomic features of botulis m are typical anticholinergic signs constipa tion, and urinary rete ntion. Nausea and vomiting ca n occur. Dil ated pupils occur in approximately 50 percent of cases. T he motor complications of botulism feature a descending paralysis leading to blurred vision and, eventually, respiratory failure may occur. Sy mptoms usually begin 12 to 36 hours followin g intoxication; time can vary accor ding to the amount of toxin absorbed and could be reduced to hours following a BW attack.3 The case-fatality rate in the US for f ood-borne botulism is 5 to 10 percent.1 pe riod ually 24 to 36 hours; for wound botulism it is usually 3 or more days.3 (7) Communicability. No person-to-person transmission.6 (8) Prevention. The vaccin e currently available is used under Investigational New Drug (IND) status .19 (9) Delivery. The primary threats are by sabotage of food and water supply and by aerosol perfr ingens is a common ana erobic bacillus that pro duces at least 12 toxins.3 (2) Occu rrence. Worldwide.3 (3) Reservoir. The reservoirs are so il and the GI tract of hea lthy people and animals.3 (4) Transmission. Transmission i s by the ingestion of food th at was contaminated by soil or feces and then held un der conditions that permit multiplication of the organism. Almost all outbrea ks are associ ated with inadequately heated or reheated meats. Spores survive cook ing and then ge rminate and multiply in storage at ambient temperatures, slow cooling, or ina dequate rewarming.1 Gas gangrene results f rom wound contamination with soil containing spores.3 (5) Symptoms. Gas gangrene features pathological death of s keletal muscles and overlying soft tissue and constitutes a surgical emergency.3 Food poisoning is an intestinal disorder characterized by sudden onset of colic followed by diarrhea; nausea is common, bu t vomiting and fever are usually absent. Generally, it is a mild disease of short duration, one day or less, and rarely fatal in healthy persons.1 IV-23 (6) Incubation period. The incubation period is 1 to 6 hours.3 (7) Communicability. No person-to-person transmission.5 (8) Prevention. Educate food handlers.1 No vacci ne is availa ble.5 (9) Delivery. The primary threat is delivery of C. perfrin gens alpha toxin as an aerosol to t he respiratory tra ct. T his would re sult in pulmonary disease, vastly different from the naturally occu rring diseases associated with C. perfring ens. The toxin may also be delivered in combination with other to xins to produce a variety of effects.3 c. Conotoxins. (1) Toxin Origi n. Conotoxins are a ne urotoxin from the mollu sks of the genus Conus , commonly known as cone snails. Th ere are potentially over 50,000 different conotoxins present in the venoms of species in the genus Conus.20 (2) Occu rrence. These cone snails live in intertidal regions of the Indian and Pacific Oce ans, east to Hawaii, north to Jap an, and south to New Zealand and Au stralia.20 (3) Reservoir. Cone snails.20 (4) Transmission. Conotoxins are in jected by the sting of a cone snail.17 (5) Symptoms. The sting produces a small, deep, triangular puncture wound. Pain results immediately, ranging from mild to severe, fol lowed by numbness and swelling at the point of envenom ation. Nausea, vo miting, difficulty swallowing, malaise, and weakness may occur. Paralysis of the resp iratory muscles might cau se the airway to collapse. The heart may beat irregularly. Neurological effects may include impaired coordination, decreased visual acuity, altered level of cons ciousness, d iminished or absent reflexes, and paralysis. The untreat ed case-fatality rate i s 70 percent.20 (6) Incubation period. Symptoms begin immedia tely.20 (7) Communicability. No person-to-person transmission. (8) Prevention. No specific antivenom exists.20 (9) Delivery. The likely disseminat ion is by respirable aeros ols or contamination of food or water supply.19 d. Diarrhea Caused by Enterohemorrhagic (EHEC) Strains E. Verotoxin-producing E. col i [VTEC]). (1) Toxin Origi n. The main EHEC serotype in North America is E. coli O157:H7. This category of diarrh eogenic E. coli produces cytotoxins. Previously, these toxins were called Verotoxins 1 and 2 Shiga -like toxins I and II.1 (2) Occu rrence. These infections are now recogniz ed to be an important problem in North Ame rica, Europe, South Africa, Japan, South America, and Australia.1 (3) Reservoir. Cattle are the most important res ervoir; however, humans may also serve as a reservoir for person-to-person transmission. There is increasing evidence in North Ame rica that de er may also serve as a reservoir.1 (4) Transmission. Transmission occurs mainly by ingestion of contaminated food. It is most often due to inadequately c ooked beef (especially ground beef), raw milk, IV-24 and fruit or vegetables contaminated with ruminant feces. Waterborne transmission has been docum ented. Transmission a lso occurs directly from person to person.1 (5) Symptoms. The diarrhea may range from mild and nonbloody to stools that are virtually all blood b ut no fecal leukocytes . Approximately 2 to 7 percent of subjects develop hemolytic uremic syndro me.1 (6) Incubation period. Ranges from 2 to 8 days, with a median of 3 to 4 days.1 (7) Communicability. Person-to-person transmission is poss ible. The du ration of excretion of the pathogen is typically a w eek or less in adults. Prolonged carriage is uncommon.1 (8) Prevention. Field sanit ation and personal hygiene are us eful tools to help prevent exposure.1 (9) Delivery. The lik ely method of dis semination is by respirable aeros ols or contamination of food or water supply.19 e. Microcystin . (1) Toxin Origi n. Common species of the blue-green algae that produce include Anabaena, class is cyanobacteria. Freshwater cyanobacte ria accumulate in surface water supplies an d appear as blue-green \"scums.\"21 For microcy stin, unlike most toxins, the toxicity is t he same, no matter wh at the route of exposure.22 Microcy stin is extremely stable and resistant to chemical hydrolysis or oxidation and remain potent even after boiling.23 (2) (3) Reservoir. Blue-green algae.22 (4) Transmission. Drinki ng or swim ming in contaminated water. Very limited available in formation suggests tha t inhalatio n in aerosols may be an equally important route of exposure.23 (5) Symp toms. Microcysti n cause gastroenteritis.20 It is a m embrane- damaging toxin. Unles s uptake of the toxin by the liver is blocked, irreversible da mage to the organ occurs wi thin 15 to 60 minutes afte r exposure to a lethal dose. When this happens, the tissue da mage to the liver is so s evere that therapy may have little or no value.22 (6) Incubation period. Data not available. (7) Communicability. In n atural wate rs and in the dark, microcystins may persist for months or years.23 (8) Prevention. Data not available. (9) Delivery. The lik ely method of dis semination is by respirable aeros ol or contamination of food a nd water su pply. f. Ricin. (1) Toxin Origi n. Ricin is a potent cytotoxin derived from the beans of the castor plant ( Ricinus co mmunis ). Large quan tities of ricin easily and inexpensively produced. Ricin toxins are potent inhibito rs of DNA replication and protein synthesis.3 IV-25 (2) Occu rrence. N/A. (3) Reservoir. Castor beans.3 (4) Transmission. Transmission has been by inha lation of org anism during industrial operations and ingestion of castor bean meal.3 (5) Symptoms. The clinical signs, symptoms, and pathological manifesta tions of ricin toxicity va ry with the dose and th e route of exposu re. Inhalation results in respiratory distress and airway an d pulmonary lesions; i ngestion causes GI signs and GI hemorrhage with necrosis of liver, spleen, and kidneys; and intramu scular intoxication causes severe localized pain, muscle and re gional lymph node necrosis, and moderate involvemen t of the visceral organs.24 (6) Incubation period. From 18 to 24 hours.3 (7) Communicability. No person-to-person transmission.3 (8) Prevention. Candidate vaccines are under development.3 (9) Delivery. The primary threat is delivery by aerosol relea se. A large quantity is required to cover a significant area on a battlefield; however, it can be used for small-scale operations. The agent may also be delivered through contamination of food and water suppl ies.3 g. Saxitoxin.3 (1) Toxin Origi n. Saxitoxi n is the parent compound of a group of related neurotoxins produced by marine dinoflagellate s of the gen us Gonyaulax . (2) Occu rrence. N/A. (3) Reservoir. Shellfish. (4) Transmission. Saxitoxin is transmitted to humans by ingesting bivalve mollusks, which accumulate dinofl agellates during toms. condition. Saxitoxin is ra pidly absorbed from the GI tract following ingestion of contaminated shellfish. Sympto ms begin as ea rly as 10 minutes to several hours after ingestion, depending on the ingest ed dose and host factors. Initial sy mptoms include numbness and tingling of the lips, ton gue, and fingertips followed by nu mbness of the neck and extremiti es and motor incoordi nation. Other symptoms may include light- headedness , dizziness, weakness, confusion, m emory loss, and headache. Flaccid paralysis and respiratory failure are life-threatening co mplications and occur within 2 to 12 hours after ingestion. Supportive care is essential. (6) Incubation period. Minutes to hours. (7) Communicability. No person-to-person transmission. (8) Prevention. No vaccine is available. (9) Delivery. The primary threat is de livery by aerosol release. Saxitoxin may also be delivered by projectiles or by contamination of food and water. h. Staphylococcal Enterotoxin B. IV-26 (1) Toxin Origi n. Staphylo B (S EB) is one of numerous exotoxins produced by Staphylococcus (S.) au reus. The SEB toxin is heat-stable and is the second mos t common source of outbreak s of food poisonin g.3 (2) Occu rrence. Worldwide and relatively frequent.1 (3) Reservoir. The reservoirs of S. aureus are hu mans and contaminated milk and milk products. Th e SEB is usually produced in foods contaminated with S. aureus.3 (4) Transmission. Ingesti on of food , milk, or milk produ cts containing preformed toxin.3 (5) Symptoms. Symptoms include the acute onset of fever, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea within hours of intoxication. Illn ess due to i nhalation will result in respiratory tract disease not encountered in the endemic d isease. Sy mptoms may also occur in the GI trac t due to inadvertent sw allowing of SEB delivered via aerosol and deposited in the uppe r aero-digestive tract.3 (6) Incubation period. Variable, 4 to 1 0 hours for GI illness.3 (7) Communicability. No person-to-person transmission.3 (8) Prevention. Follow strict food hygi ene and sanitation controls.1 Prote cting food and water supplies from contamination a nd avoiding potentially contaminated food and water will protect individuals from the e ffects of ingested toxins. No vaccine is available.3 (9) Delivery. The primary threat is SE B aerosol release. The SEB ma y also be employed by sabotage contamination of food a nd/or water supplies.5 i. Tetrodotoxin (Puffer Fish Poisoning). (1) Toxin Origi n. The causative toxin is tetrodotoxin, a heat-stable, nonpr otein neurotoxin1 that even in small am ounts can cause rapid and violent death in humans.17 (2) Occu rrence. Majority of cases occur in Japan where puffer fish is a traditional delicacy.20 (3) Reservoir. A variety of marine species\u2014notably the puffer fish, California newt,20 porcupine fish, ocean sunfish, and species of newts and salam anders.1 (4) Transmission. Poison ing results from consuming tetrod otoxin.20 (5) Symptoms. Puffer fish poisoning is characteriz ed by onset of paresthesias, dizziness, GI symptoms, and ataxia, which ofte n progresses rapidly to paralysis and death within several hours after eating. The case-fatality rate a pproaches 60 percent.1 (6) Incubation period. Symptoms can ap pear 20 minutes to 3 hours after toxin is introduced. Death ca n occur 4 to 6 hours after introduction.20 (7) Communicability. No person-to-person transmission.20 (8) Prevention. There is no specific antidote available.20 Avoid ingesting any of the fish or amphibians that pro duce tetrodotoxin.1 (9) Delivery. The lik ely method of dis semination is by respirable aeros ols or contamination of food or water supply.22 (T-2) mycotoxins are a diverse group of over 40 compounds produced by molds of the genus Fusarium . These toxins inhibit protein and DNA s ynthesis and mi tochondrial respiratio n and alter cell membrane structure and function.3 (2) Occu rrence. Worldwide. Natura lly occurring mycotoxicos is occurs in livestock following ingestion of grains contam inated with molds. Wh en maintai ned as either crystalline powders or liqui d solutions, these compounds are s table when exposed to air, light, or both. They are not ina ctiva ted b y autoclaving but require heating at 900 degrees F for 10 minutes or 500 degrees F for 30 minut es for complete inactivation. A 3 to 5 percent solution of bleach is an ef fective inact ivation agent Ingesti on of moldy grains.3 (5) Symp toms. Mycotoxins are highly cytotoxic an d have effects similar to vesicants, especially mustard agents. Deliver y to the ski n may cause a burning skin pain, redness, tenderness, blistering, and progress ion to skin necrosis with eschar formation and sloughing. Respiratory exposure may result in nasal itching with pain, rhinorrhea, sneezing, wheezing, an d cough.3 (6) Incubation period. The incubatio n period is minutes after exposure.3 (7) Communicability. No person-to-person transmission.3 (8) Prevention. As a pre-exposure pr ophylaxis, th e use of topical antivesicant cream or ointment may provide limited prote ction of sk in surfaces. Food and water contaminated with my cotoxi ns must not be consumed.3 Washing the exposed s kin areas with soap and water will decrease absorption through the skin.25 (9) Delivery. The toxin may be delivered by aerosol releas e or through the contamination of food a nd water su pplies. Th ese toxins are the agents allegedly delivered via aerosol during the \"Yellow Rain\" attack s in Afghanistan and Southeast Asia during 1970s and 1980s. The T-2 mycoto xins are the on ly potential BW agents that can harm and be absorbed through th e intact ski n.3 IV-28 NOTES 1James Chin (ed.), Control of Communicable Diseases M anual , 17th ed., United Book Press, Inc., Baltimore, MD, 2000. 2TM 3-216/AFM 355-6, 44-156/MCRP 4-11.1C, Treatment of Biological Warf are A gent Ca sualties, 17 July 2000. 4BG Russ Z ajtchu k, et al.

IV-30 Chapter V TOXIC INDUS TRIAL CHEMICALS AND THEIR PROPERTIES 1. Background In April 1915, the Germans releas ed 150 tons of a TIC (chlorine gas) across a 4-mile front in one of the first gas attacks of WWI. It is estimated that up to 5,000 allied soldiers were killed and 20,000 became casualties. In addition to chlorine, ot her gases were used against the Allies in other periods during this war. Arsine, cyanogen chloride, hydrogen cyanide, ph osgene, and hydrogen s ulfide were used during WWI. In most cases, these gases were first d eveloped for industrial purposes, but the potential of thes e chemicals as war gases was recognized. In Bhopal, India, in December 1984 , an accidental release of methyl isocyanate from a production facility kille d an estimated 2,500 persons and left many thousands injured.1 a. Potential Hazard. The US troops\u2014through the deliberat e release, a ccidental release, or as a result of collateral damage \u2014could encoun ter TIC. Military personnel are trained to operate in an environment in which CW weapons may be used. H owever, the potential hazards of TIC are a relatively new threat. These forces mu st be able to safely operate, survive, and sustain operations in those instances where they may be exposed to toxic industrial hazards. Commanders have dire ct responsibility for protecting their forces against these threats and, therefore, must beco me aware of and plan for defense against the potential release of TIC in their AO. In futu re operations, failure to properly plan for the release of TIC may result in signif icant casualties, disruption of oper ations, and mission degradation . b. Characteris tics. A number of hazards are associated with a release of TIC. Some key f actors are\u2014 (1) Certain chemicals have the ability to bypass or penetrate current military protective equipment and, in many cases, are not detectable by current military equipment. (2) Exposure can be through several ro utes, inclu ding inhalation, ingestion, or surface cont act with the material. (3) Many of these chemical s cause a variety of immediate and delayed symptoms t hat make d etection, di agnosis, an d treatment difficult. (4) Symp toms are often difficult to tra ce back to a specific chemical. (5) Determining the exposure level that constitutes a hazard for the individual is often diffi cult due to the variances of susceptibility amon g individuals. c. Protection. It is important that co mmanders and troops be aware that the best defense aga inst TIC is to escape the path of the TIC immediately. The military field protective mask can provide lim ited protection and shoul d only be us ed to escape the hazard area . Personnel or equipment that have been cont aminated with TIC can be decontaminated by was hing with large amo unts of cold, soapy water. Contaminated clothing should be imm ediately removed and disposed of in a safe m anner. V-1 d. TIC of Concern. The TIC have important phys ical properties (such as reactivity, flammabilit y, or corrosivity), and these properties cause many chemical injuries and damage annually. For example, the United Nations Environmental Protection Organiza tion (UNEPO) developed a list of accidents (1970-98) involving hazardo us substances in which th ere were at least 25 deaths, 125 injured, 10 thousand evacuated or deprived of water, or $10 million US damages to third parties. See T able V-1 for a listing of the hazardous substances, primar ily TIC, that were involved. Table V-1. Accidents I nvolving Hazardous Su bstances Chemical Cla ss Frequ ency % Ever used as a weapon? Fuel ga ses 15 Yes - Columb ia, 2000 Explosives 12 Yes - Oklahom a City bomb Liquid fuels 8 Yes - animal rig hts and environ mental arson Petrochem icals 8 Yes - Kutina, Croatia Chlorine 8 Yes - Jovan, Croatia Oil 7 Yes -Texas, Co lumbia, Guatemala, Kuw ait Ammonia 6 Yes - Kutina, Croatia Acids & bases 6 Yes - abortion clin ics Plast ics manufa cture 3 No ors 3 Yes - Bhopal (s abotage) PCBs (slow onset) 2 No Fertilizers 2 Yes - Oklahom a City bomb Dusts (e.g., grain elevator) 1 Yes - IEDs Radiation 1 Yes - RDDs (Moscow ) Other Chemica ls 13 Yes - arsenic, cy anides, phosg ene, metals Not specif ied 5 NA (1) As shown, fuel gases, explosives, liquid fuel, p etrochemicals, and oil account for nearly 50 percent of the incidents. (2) Consideration of a chemical's many hazardou s properties is reinforced by the criteria governing the US chemical manuf acturing Risk Managem ent Progra m (RMP). The RMP, instituted in June 1999, under US federal regulations, requ ires certain chemical facilities to implement chemical accident pr evention and preparedness measures and to submit summary reports to the government every 5 years. The RMP database contains information on 14,828 f acilities con taining 20,210 chemical processes. Of these processes, 17,529 contain at least one TIC an d 8,107 contain at least one flamma ble chemica l. Chemicals s uch as anhydrous ammonia, chlo rine, propane, and flammable mixtures are present in nearly 70 percent of all RMP processes. 2. Other Information S ources Multiple data sources are available to supp ort the need for data and information to support the military decision-making process (MDMP). These sources include\u2014 a. North Ame rican Guidebook (NAERG) 2000 (h ttp:// hazmat.dot. gov/gy debook.htm). (1) The US DOT, Transport Canada, a nd the Secretariat of Communications and Transp ortation (S CT) of Mexico developed the Emergency Response Guid e (ERG) 2000 jointly for use by firefighters, police, and ot her emergency services personnel who may be the first to arrive at th e scene of a transporta tion incident involving a hazardous material. It is primarily a guide to aid first responders in quickly identifying the specific or generic classification of the material(s) involved in the incident, and protecti ng themselves and the general public during this initial r esponse ph ase of the i ncident. The ERG is updated every 3 years to accommodate new products and technology. The ERG 200 0 incorporates V-2 dangerous goods lists f rom the most recent United Nations (UN) recommendations as well as from other international and na tional regulations. (2) The DOT goal is to pla ce one ERG 2000 in eac h emergency service ve hicle, nationwide, through di stribution to state and loca l public safety auth orities. To date, more than 7 milli on copies h ave been di stributed without charge to the emergency responder community. Copies are made available free of charge to public emergency responders through the state coordinators (US on ly). In Canada, contact the Canadian Transport. Emergency Centre (CANUTEC) at 613-992-4624 or e-mail canutec@tc.gc.ca for information . In Mexico, call SCT a t 52-5-684-1275. b. NIOSH /npg.html ). (1) The NPG is intended a source of general in dustrial hygiene infor mation for work ers, employers, and occupational he alth professiona ls. The NPG presents k ey information and data in abbreviated tabular fo rm for 677 chemicals or substance groupings (e.g., manganese comp ounds, tellu rium compound s, inorganic tin compounds, etc.) that a re found in the work envi ronment. The industri al hygiene information found in the pocket guide shoul d help users recognize and con trol occupational chemical hazards. Th e chemicals or substances contained in this re vision include all substances for which the NIOS H has recommended exposure limits (REL s) and those with permissible exposure limits (PELs) as found in the Occu pational Safety and He alth Administration (OSHA) General Industry Air Contaminants Standard (29 Code of Federal Regulations [CFR] 1910.1000). (2) The information in the NPG incl udes chemical structures and formulas, identification codes, synonyms, exposure limits , chemical and physical properties, incompatibilities and reactivities, measurement methods, respirator selections, s igns and symptoms of exposure, and proced ures for em ergency treatment. c. Registry of Ch (RTECS) provides toxicological information with citatio ns on over 140,000 chemical substances. These detailed profiles include toxicological data a nd reviews, international workplace exposure limits, references to US standards and regulations, analytical methods, and exposure and hazard survey da ta. (2) The data ar e compiled into substance records f or ease of use, and updated data are fully integrate d. d. International Chemical Safety Ca rds (ICSCs) (http:// www.cd c.gov/niosh/ipcs/icstart.htm l). (1) The International Program on Chemical Safety (IPCS) is a joint activ ity of three cooperating International Organization s: the United Nations Environment Program (UNE P), th e International Labor Office (ILO), and the WHO. The m ain objective of the IPCS is to c arry out an d disseminate evaluat ions of the ha zards posed by chemicals to human health and the environment. (2) An ICSC su mmarizes essential hea lth and safety informati on on TIC. The ICSCs are not legally binding documents, but consist of a series of st andard phrases, mainly summarizing health and safety informat ion collected, verified, and peer-reviewed by V-3 internationally recognized experts, taking in to account advice from manufacturers and poison cont rol centers. e. Chemical Hazard Response Inf ormation System (CHRI S) (http:// www.chris manual.com ). (1) The CHRIS database is a comprehensive source of emergency response information for those in volved in the trans port of hazardous materials (HAZM AT). The database is based upon the text of the Unit ed States Coast Guard (USCG) CHRI S manual. At printin g, this site does not yet have an electronic version of CHRIS available. (2) Records for more than 1,300 HAZ MAT are provided in English. Each record for a HAZM AT contains key identifi cation data, such as synonyms, Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS) numbers, hazard labe ls, and observable characteristics. In addition, information useful for em ergency re sponse situa tions\u2014such as health, f ire and reactivity h azards, first aid, water polluti on, s hipping and hazard classifications, and physical and chemical properties\u2014is included in each record. f. Hazardous Substances Data Ban k (HSDB) (h ttp: www.nlm.nih.gov/pubs/factsheets/hsdbfs.html ). (1) The HSDB is a nonbib liographic data bank created and maintained by the National Library of Medicine (NLM) in the US. (2) The data bank provides extensive information on identific ation, manufacturing, use, chemical and physical properties, sa fety and ha ndling, human and nonhuman toxicity, ph armacology, environmenta l fate and exposure, regulations, and analytical determinations of chemical substances. (3) HSDB information is or ganized into chemical records, with records for over 4,500 chemical substances. g. Extremely H azardous Substance (EHS ) Chem ical Profiles and Emergency First Aid Guides. ( http://www.epa.gov/s wercepp/eh s/ehslist.ht ml). (1) This guide contains information on over 300 EHSs curre ntly listed as part of Section 302 of the Emerg ency P lanning an d Co mmunity Right- to-Know Act . (2) Each chemical profile includes physical/chemical properties, health hazards, fire and explosion hazards, reactivity data, preca utions for s afe handlin g and use, and protecti ve equipment of emergency situations. (3) The first aid guide pro vides signs and sympto ms of poisoning and emergency treatment f or first responders. Th e chemical profiles and first aid guides may be accessed from either the CAS nu mber or alphabetical list of EHSs. 3. Reach-Back Capability2 a. General. Technical reach-back is the ability to contact technical subject matter experts (SMEs) when a technical issue exceed s the on-scene SME's capability. Reach-back should be c onducted using establis hed unit pr otocols. Ma ny of the reach-back resources have other primary mi ssions and are not specific ally resourced for re ach-back. See FM 3- 11.21 for additional res ources. b. National Response Cen ter (NRC). Th e NRC mans the hotl ine service and serves as an emer gency resource for first responders to request technical ass istance during an V-4 incident. The intended users inclu de trained emergency personnel (s uch as emergency operators) and first responders (such as firefighters, police, and emer gency medi cal technicians [EMTs]) wh o arrive at the scene of a CB terror ist incident. Other pote ntial users may include the state emergency operatio ns centers (EOCs) and hospitals that may treat vic tims of agent exposure. (1) The USCG operates the NRC, and tra ined operators staff the hotline 7 days a week, 24 hours a day. NRC du ty officers ta ke reports of actual or potential domestic terrorism and link emergency calls with app licable SMEs (such as United States Army Soldier and Biological Chemical Command [S BCCOM] an d United Sta tes Army M edical Research Institute of Chemical Defense [USA MRICD]) fo r technical assistance and with th e FBI for federal response actions. The NRC also provides reports and notifications to other federal agencies as nec essary. Specialty areas include the following: (a) Detection equipment. (b) Personal protective equipment (PPE). (c) Decontamination systems and methods. (d) Physical properties of CB agents. (e) Toxicology information. (f) Medical symptoms from exposure to CB agents. (g) Treatment of exposure to CB agents. (h) Hazard prediction models. (i) Federal response asset s. (j) Applicable laws and regulations. (2) The CB hot line is a joint effort of the USCG, Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Federal Emergency Mana gement Age ncy (FE MA), EPA, Dep artment of Health and Human Services (DHHS), and the DO D. The NRC is the entry point for the CB hotline. The NRC recei ves basic incident information and links the caller to the DOD and FBI CB and terrorism experts. The se and other federal agencies can be accessed within a few minutes to provide technical assistance duri ng a potential CB incident. If the situation warran ts, a federal response action may be initiated. (3) Use the local establish ed policie s and procedures for requesting federal assistance before contacting the CB hot line. State and local officials can access the hotline in emergen cy circumstances by calling 1-800-424-8802. V-5 NOTES 1A.K.

I-4 Appendix J SELECTED ANIMAL PATHOGENS 1. Backgrou nd This appendix provide s summaries of animal diseases l isted in The Biological and Chemical Warfar e Threat (1999). The information generally addressed in this a ppendix provides descriptions, treatment, and control measures. The military role, if an y, would likely be in a consequence management support role, and the brief descriptions provided furnish an awareness of the agents that could be used. F or further information, contact the Army Medi cal Department (AMEDD). 2. Animal Diseases a. African Swi ne Fever (ASF).1 (1) ASF is a tick-borne and contagious disease of swine caused by a virus and characterized by hemorrhages of internal or gans, high fever, moderate anorexia, and leukopia. Mortality rates may reach 100 percent. It occurs in Africa and on the island of Sardinia. (2) There is no treatment a vailable. (3) Control. Slaughter an d disposal of all acutely infected pigs, widespread testing and elimination of all s eropositive ani mals, and good herd isolation and s anitary practices ca n accomplish control and eradication of ASF in developed countries. There is no vaccine. (4) Human beings are not susceptible to ASF. b. Avian Influenza (AI) (Fowl Plague).2 (1) AI is a dise ase of viral etiology that ranges fro m a mild or even asymptomatic infection to an acute, fatal disea se of chick ens, turk eys, guinea fowls, and other avian species, esp ecially migratory wa terfowl. H ighly pathogenic AI viruses have periodically occurred in recent year s in Aus tralia, England, South Afri ca, Scotland, Ireland, Mexico, Pakistan, and the US. It is generally acce pted belief that waterfowl, sea birds, or shore birds are generally responsible for intro ducing the vi rus into poultry. Death may occur withi n 24 hours of first signs of disease, frequently within 48 hours, or can be delayed for as long as a week. (2) The practice of accepted sanitation and biosec urity pro cedures in the rearing of the poultry is of utmost importance. In areas where waterfowl, shore b irds, or sea birds are prevalent, the rearing of poultry on open range is incomp atible with a sound AI prevention program. Cleaning and disinfection procedures are critical. (3) The AI viruses are Type A influenz a viruses, and the possi bility exists that they could be involved in the devel opmen t, through genetic reassortment, of new mammalian strains. The infection and deaths of 6 of 18 h umans infected with a n AI virus in Hong Ko ng in 1997 has resulted in a recons ideration of the role that the avian species have on the epidemiology of human influenza. J-1 (4) The AI viruses are Type A influenz a viruses, and the possi bility exists that they could be involved in the devel opmen t, through genetic reassortment, of new mammalian strains. c. Bluetongue (Sore Muzzle).3 (1) Bluetongue is an acute, noncontagiou s, insect-borne diseas e of sheep, goats, cattle, and wild ruminants caused by a virus. Occu rrence is probably worldwide. Cattle and goats with inappar ent infections are important reserv oirs of the virus. (2) The only applicable treatment available is to minimize a nimal stres s and administer broad-spectrum antibiotics to combat secondary infections. (3) A live attenuated vacci ne is availa ble for use in sheep in t he US. (4) There is only one documented human infection, and that was a laboratory worker. d. Foot-and-Mouth Disease (FMD).4 (1) FMD is a highly contagious dise ase of cloven-fo oted domestic and wild animals ca used by a virus. The morbidity is essentially 1 00 percent, and the mortality is less than 1 percent. Great economic loss result s from the effects of the disease, w hich include lam eness, l ow milk production, weight loss, mastit is, debilitati on, and abortion. FMD occu rs in many major liv estock-produ cing countries. (2) A number of inactivate d vaccines, including t hose prepared in cell cultures containing the appropriate types or subtypes, are used in countries where the dise ase is endemic. The duration of immunit y may be as short as 4 months. Treatment to prevent and cope with secondary in fection may be necessary. (3) In countries free of FMD, a policy of quarantine and slau ghter is usually practiced with the goal of complete eradication. (4) In a review of the zoonotic aspects of FMD by K. Bauer in 1997, he reported that, since 1921, the FMD virus h as been is olated and typed from slightly over 4 0 human cases. The cases occurred on three contin ents: Europe, Africa, and South America. Because infection is uncommon, FMD is not co nsidered to be a public health problem. e. Sheep Pox and Goat Pox.5 (1) Sheep pox and goat pox, in fully su sceptible an imals, are h ighly conta gious and often fatal diseases caused by a capripoxvi rus and characterized by fever and pox. The diseases ar e endemic in Africa, th e Middle East, the Indian subcontinent, and much of Asia. Transmission is by direct and indirect contac t, and the viruses can survive on contaminated premises for many months. (2) There is no treatment a vailable. (3) When a new case is confirmed, the area shou ld be quarantined, infected and exposed animals s hould be sla ughtered, and the premises clean ed and disinfected. Vaccination of susceptible animals on premise s surrounding the infected flock should be considered. (4) There is no conclusive evidence that SGPV infects humans. f. Aujeszky's Disease caus ed by porci ne herpesvirus-1. Pigs are the main host, but sporadic ca ses have occurred in cat tle, sheep, g oats, horses, dogs, cats, foxes, and rodents. AJD is highly contagious and is principally spre ad via the respiratory route. It is endemic in the swine of many countries. It occurs frequently in the US, but n ot in Canada and Australia. (2) There is no treatment a vailable. (3) Live attenuated and inactivated virus vaccine s are available to reduce losses in herds in which the diseas e is a contin uing problem. Vaccina tion does not necessarily prevent infection or shedding of the virus. (4) There is no transmission to humans. g. Hog Choler a (Swine Fever).7 (1) Hog cholera , a highly contagious disease, is caused by a virus and is characterized in fully s usceptible pigs by hi gh mortality. The disease occurs in many countries of Europe, Africa, and As ia. It has b een eradicated in Australia, Canada, and the US. The di sease is spread by direct and indirect contact. (2) There is no treatment a vailable. (3) A strict regimen of vaccination w ill reduce the number of outbreaks to a level at which complete eradication by sanitary measure al one will be f easible. (4) Human beings are not susceptible to Hog Cholera infection. h. Lyssa Virus (Rabies).8 (1) Rabies infections are usually esta blished following introd uction of virus- infected saliva into a bite or scratc h, although animals ca n also be infected by th e oral and nasal (olfac tory) routes . Bat-infested cave s may result in infectious aerosols; nonb ite transmission of the dis ease from t his source h as been rep orted in a number of an imal species, including humans. The disease gener ally takes one of two forms: \"furious,\" with sporadic episodes of rage; or \"dumb,\" in which there is an early prog ressive paralysis. Both forms almost invariably result in death. A normally lively and sociable dog, for example, may become anorexic, withdra wn, irritable, or restless. This behavior may suddenly change, with the animal becoming highly affe ctionate. At this stage, the dog may try repeatedly to lick the hands and face of its owne r or handler. As the disease pr ogresses, the animal may appear to have difficulty swallowing , as if a bone were caught in its throat. Any attempt to alleviate the problem manually exposes the handler to considerable risk, either through a bite or the deposition of virus-infected saliva on mucous membr anes or minor scratches. The dog's bark be comes high pitched and hoarse, indicating the onset of paralysis. The animal drools saliv a. Convul sive seizures and muscular incoordination become apparent, followed by pro gressive paraly sis, usua lly terminating in death within 7 days of the onset of sy mptoms. In about 25 to 50 percent of cases, ap parently as a result of limbic lobe dysfunction , dogs with rabies devel op the furious form of the disease. Affected animals ma y eat abnormal objects, and during paroxysms of rage, will attack almost anything. Rabies is present in mo st of Eu rope, throughout Africa, t he Middle East, and most of Asia and the Americas. The UK, Ir eland, parts of Scandinavia, Japan, Singapore, Australia, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, and the Pacific Islands are free of rabies. (2) There is no treatment a vailable. J-3 (3) Once a viru lent strain of rabies virus has esta blished itself in the CNS of an infected animal, the ou tcome is almost always deat h. At a practical level, however, the only ways of pre venting rabies are by preexposure immunization. (4) All warm blooded anim als, including humans, are susceptible. i. Velogenic Newcastle Disease (VND ) (Exotic Ne wcastle Dis ease, Asiatic Newcastle disease).9 (1) VND is like ly the most diseas e of poult ry throu ghout the worl d. In chickens it is characteri zed by morbidity ra tes near 100 percent and mortality rates as high as 90 percent in susceptible chickens. (2) The establishment of a strict quarantine, destruction of all infected and exposed birds followed by thorough cleaning, and disinfection of the p remises are the main actions necessary for eradication of VND virus. VND virus has been r ecovered from effluent water for as long as 21 days and from carcasses for 7 days when the daytime temperatures were ove r 90 degrees. (3) Although people may b ecome in fected with V ND virus, t he resulting disease is typically limited to conjunctivitis. Recovery is usually rapid, and the v irus is no longer present in eye fl uids after 4 to 7 days . Infections have occurre d mostly in laboratory workers an d vaccinati ng crews, with rare ca ses in poultr y handlers. No instance of transmission to humans through h andling or co nsuming of poultry products is kn own. Individuals with conjun ctivitis fro m VND virus should not enter poultry premis es or come in contact with live avian species. j. Peste Des Petits Ruminants (PPR) (Pest of Small Rumina nts).10 (1) PPR is an acute or subacute disease of sheep and goats caused by a virus. The disease is not contagious, and transmissi on requires close contact. The mortality, depending on the form, varies form 50 to 80 percent. The disease ha s been reported from west and ce ntral Africa , the Middle East, and the Indian s ubcontinent. (2) There is no specific treatment for PPR. Dru gs that control bacterial and parasitic co mplications may decrea se mortality. (3) Eradication is recommended when PPR appears in new areas. Methods should include quarantine, slaught er, and pro per disposal of carcasses and contact fomites; decontamination; and restrictions on importati on of sh eep and goats from affected areas. (4) PPR is not infectious to humans. k. Swine Vesicular Disease (SVD).11 (1) SVD is a co ntagious disease of swin e. This di sease produ ces lesi ons that are grossly indistinguishable from those of FM D. In the natural disease, the prognosis is favorable; however, in most countries, as s oon as it is reco gnized, the pigs are slaughtered. This diseas e, which has been reported from several European countries and Asia, does not occur in North Americ a. (2) There is no treatment a vailable. (3) Preventive measures i nclude co ntrol of animals imported from infected areas and sanitary dis posal of garbage from international aircraft an d ships. Eradication J-4 measures consist of qu arantining infected far ms and areas, slaughtering and disposing of infected and exposed pigs, and cleaning and disinfecting infected pre mises. (4) Human infection has been reported in laboratory personnel working with the virus. Caution should be taken when wor king with i nfected mat erial. l. Rinderpest.12 (1) Rinderpest is a contagious viral disease of cat tle, domestic buffalo, and some species of wildlife. The diseas e is found only in the Indian subcontinent, Near East, and sub-Saharan Africa. Transmission is by direct and i ndirect contact. Aerosol transmission is not a significant m eans of tran smission except in confined areas and over short distances. In fully susceptible cattle, the mortality may approa ch 100 percent with some virulent strains. (2) There is no treatment a vailable. (3) If an outbreak occurs, the area should be quarantined, infected and exposed animals sla ughtered a nd buried or burned, and ring vaccination considered. (4) There are no reports of Rinderpest infection in humans. m. Enterovirus Encephalomyelitis disea ses are caus ed by seve ral closely related enteroviruses. They occur in pigs of all ages and are characterized by a fever and convulsions, stiffnes s, spasms, and paralys is. The hig hly virulent strain (Teschen Disease) has a mortality ra te of 70 to 90 percent. Transmission is made by direct or in direct contact, swill feeding, and fomites. Teschen disease is f ound in central and eastern Europe, Madagasca r, and Ugan da. (2) There is no treatment a vailable for this pathogen. (3) Live attenuated and inactivated vaccines are effective in controlling the disease. Q uarantine and hygienic measures s hould be applied. In the US, strict import regulations must be foll owed for Teschen disea se. (4) Pigs are the only susceptible specie s. n. Vesicular Stomatitis.14 (1) Vesicular stomatitis is a contagious disease of cattle, horses, and pigs. The disease occ urs in North and Central America and the northern part o f South Am erica. The incubation period is us ually 24 hours; and dire ct contact, biting insects, and fomites spread the disease rapidly. Humans may be infected by contact a nd by aerosol. (2) There is no treatment except the us e of mild an tiseptics and astringen ts on the mucosa of the mouth. (3) Infected and exposed animals should be quarantined. A vaccine is available in some count ries. (4) Vesicular stomitis (New Jersey and Indiana) inf ection frequently occurs in man and causes influ enza-like symptoms, but ra rely res ults vesicular stomitis viruses (Piry, Isfahan, and Chandipura) are much more infectious for ma n. o. Contagious Bovine Pleu ropneumonia (CBPP).15 J-5 (1) CBPP is m ycoides and primarily af fects cattle. The principal mode of infect ion is by in halation. The disease occurs in Afr ica and some regions of Asia (esp ecially India and China), with occasional outbreaks in Europe. (2) Treatments are generally ineffective for this pathogen. (3) CBPP is a n otifiable dis ease in m ost countries. A live attenuated vaccine is employed i n areas where eradication is not fe asible. (4) There is no evidence to indicate that humans are susceptible to this disease. p. Contagious Equine Metritis (CEM).16 (1) CEM is a highly contagious diseas e of horses. It has been reported fro m Australia, Ireland, a number of European countries, Japan, Belgium, Denmark, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, and Luxembourg. The disease ha s been eradicated from the US. (2) Treatment of mares with antimicr obial drugs is not always effective, even though the disease-causing organism is gener ally susceptible to antibiotics. (3) This is a reportable disease in Nor th America. Quarantin e or isolation with attempts to eliminate actively infec ted anima ls and positive carriers is generally used. (4) There is no evidence that man is affected by th e CEM. q. Heartwater (Cowdriosis ).17 (1) Heartwater is a caused by and in Af rica, Madag ascar, Guadeloupe, and other island s of the Caribbean. Cattle, sheep, and goats are affected; and indigenous breed s are more resistant than imported ones. (2) Treatment involves administering tetracy clines. (3) Preventive measures include contro l of ticks. Simultaneous infection with infectious blood and treatment wit h tetracy clines provides protection against some strains. (4) Humans are not known to be affec ted by Heartwater. r. Screwworm Myiasis.18 (1) Myiasis is t he infestati on of live vertebrate animals with larvae, which for at least a certain period, feed on the host's de ad or living tissue, liquid body substances, or ingested food. Scre wworm larvae p enetrate d eeply into a wound of a warm-blooded animal and feed on living tissue and body fluid. (2) Screwworm myiasis is t reated with topical application of a n approved larvacide directly into t he infested wound. (3) Where screwworm is endemic, animals must be inspected at least every 3 to 4 days to discover and treat cases of screwworm myiasis. (4) Humans are susceptibl e to screwworm myiasis. s. Enterovirus Infections of Swine (Virus Infection of J-6 (1) This virus causes stillb irths, mummification, and infertility. These infec tions can be widesp read where swine are raised intensively. (2) There is no treatment f or this virus. (3) Enterovirus can be controlled by comingling new replacem ent boars or gilts by fence-line contact or exchange of manur e for 30 days before breedin g begins. NOTES 1 C.A.

Backgrou nd The purpose of this ap pendix is to provide a brief summary of select plant diseases listed in The Biological and Chemi cal Warfa re Thre at (1999). The military could potentially be involved in a conseq uence mana gement support role, and brief descriptions are provided to furnish an awareness of thes e agents. For further information, contact AMEDD. 2. Bacterial Diseases a. Xanthomonas albilin eans.1 (1) Description . Leaf Scald (Suga r Cane). (2) Specific Bacteria. Xanthomonas al bilineans. (3) Symptom. The initial characterist ic symptom is one or mo re narrow, white \"pencil lines\" running longitudinally down the leaf blade into the sheath. Under severe disease con ditions, entire plants may die. (4) Transmission. The bacterium lives from year to year in inf ected plants. It is spread by the harvester and possibly by other cultivation practices th at cause plant wounding. The disease can be spread aerially in windblown rain. (5) Control Measures. The main control measures are use of disease-free or treated seed and crop r otation. Additionally, the disease is kept out of production areas through qu arantine of varieties in troduced from other areas. b. Xanthomonas campestris pv. citri.2 (1) Description . . first appearance is as oily-Looking, 2- to 10-mm circular spo ts. The lesions are often similarly sized. Later, they become white or yellow spongy pustules. The p ustules dark en and th icken into ta n to brown corky canke rs. Sunken cra ters are noticeable on fruits. De foliation occurs on severely infected t rees. (4) Transmission. The bacterium is spread primarily by wind-driven rain, overhead irrigation, and contaminated equipmen t. Citr us canker s eems to be much more severe in areas in which the periods of high rainfall coincide with the period of high mean temperature (such as Florida and other Gulf Coast states). (5) Control Measures. In canker-free, citrus-producing areas, strict quarantine measures a re practiced. When the canker bac terium is found in such an area, control is attempted by burning all infected and adjacen t trees to prevent the spread of the pathogen. Xanthomonas campestris Bacteria. Bacterium-Xanthomonas ca mpestris pv. oryzae. (3) Symp tom. The first symptom of the disease is a water-soaked lesion on the edges of the leaf blades near the lea f tip. (4) Transmission. High ra infall and s trong winds are thought to provide conditions for the bacteria to multiply and enter the leaf through injured tissue. (5) Control Measures. Fal l plowing or rolling of st ubble to ha sten decay of the rice debris should help t o manage the disease by destroyi ng the tissue in which the bacterium is maintained. d. Xylella fasti diosa (grapevines).4 (1) Description . (2) Specific Bacteria. Bacterium-Xylel la fastidios a. (3) Symptom. In grapes, symptoms appear as a sudden dryi ng and scorching of much of the margin area of the le af while the rest of the l eaf is still green. Grape clusters on vines with leaf symptoms stop growing, wilt , and dry u p. The bacterium also causes leaf scorching in the American elm, ma ple, mulber ry, and plu m. In the peach and alfalfa plants, the bacterium slows and stunts growth. (4) Transmission. The pathogen is transmitted by certain kin ds of leafhoppers known as sharpshooters. The leaf hopper ve ctors transmit the bacter ia from diseased to healthy plants. (5) Control Measures. There is no pr actical cont rol of Pierce's disease of grapes in the field. All commercial grape varieties are susceptible to the disea se. 3. Fungal Diseases a. Colletotrichum Coffeanum.5 (1) Description. Coffee Be rry Disease (CBD) (coffee). (2) Specific Fu ngi. Colletotrichum Coffeanum. (3) Symp tom. CBD a ttacks the green tissues at the beginning stage of berry development, often penetrating int o the interi or of the berry and destroying the bean. (4) Transmission. Infected berries are the major source of transmission. Rain is also a major factor re sponsible for spreading spores. Windblown rain also results in local dispersal from tree to tree or over relatively short distances. If an inf ected seed is planted, systemic seed-borne in oculum coul d easily infect the bark of young seedlings and become established in mature orchards. (5) Control Measures. Since CBD is lim ited to Africa, precau tions should be taken with coffee seeds from this region. b. Cochiliobol us miyabeans (Helminthosporium oryzae).6 (1) Description . Brown ngi. Cochliobolus miya beanus (Helminthosporium oryzae). K-2 (3) Symptom. Leaf spots initially appear as smal l circular to oval spots on the first seedlin g leaves. Leaf spots are observed throughout the growing season and can vary in size, sha pe, and color. Small spots are dark brown to reddish brown while large spots have a light, reddish-brown or gray center surr ounded by a dark to reddish-brown margin. Older spots may have a bright yellow halo surround ing the lesion . Severely infected leaves will produce lightweight or chalky kernels. (4) Transmission. The dis ease spread s from plant to plant in the field by airborne spores. Disea se develop ment is fa vored by high relative humidity (86 to 100 percent) an d temperatures between 68 and 78 degr ees F. Leaves must be continuously wet for 8 to 24 hours for infection to occur. (5) Control Measures. The best m anagement stra tegy is balanced nutriti on because plants that g row in soils with nutriti onal deficien cies or in so ils where n utrient uptake is hindered are more susceptible to in fection. Fungicidal seed treatment has proven very effecti ve in reducing seedling brown spot disease. c. Microcyclus ulei.7 (1) Disease. South American Leaf B light (He vea species only , yields latex). (2) Specific Fungi. Microcyclus ulei (M. ulei). (3) Symptom. The symptoms vary with the age of the leaves; however, on young leaves up to 10 days old, slightly colo red hypertroph ic deformations are visible 3 to 4 days after i noculation. (4) Transmission. Plants older than 4 to 5 years normally change leaves once a year at the onset of the dry season. This c hange behavior is very important for a n epidemic of M. ulei b ecause leav es are only susceptible when they are less tha n 10 to 15 days old. The spores of M. ulei a re dissemin ated mainly by rain splash or wind. (5) Control Measures. The disease th reatens the rubber cultivation in the tropical regions of the globe. d. Puccinia gr aminis tritici.8 (1) Disease. W heat Stem Rust (wheat; some varieties of barl ey, oats, and rye; wild barley; and goat grass). (2) Specific Fungi. Puccinia graminis. (3) Symptom. Wheat stem rust is en countered during growing season and may occur on any abovegrou nd parts. Rust spots ar e very small, circular or elongated, and vivid orange-red in color. Later in the year, the rust pustules dark en because of the p roduction of dark brown spores that are the over-wintering stage of the rust. (4) Transmission. Virtually all of the stem rust infections come by way of spores blown in from in fected fields of other regions. (5) Control Measures. Pla nt-resistant wheat vari eties are available. If necessary, apply a foliar fungicide at the ve ry early stage of disease d evelopment . e. Puccinia striiformis.9 (1) Disease. Stripe Rust of Whea t (mainly wheat, can occasionally infect barley, triti cale, and cereal rye). K-3 (2) Specific Fungi. Puccinia striiformi s. (3) Symptom. Initially, s mall areas 1 to 10 meters in diam eter will appear as yellow patches in paddocks. Infected leaves develop yellow-orange spore masses (pustules) in long stripes on the leaves, but rarely on the stems and heads. As the crop matures, the spore masses turn from yellow to black stripe s. (4) Transmission. The dis ease, l ike leaf rust, develops from s pores blown in from other wheat-gro wing areas. Stripe ru st spores can be spread on contaminated clothing. (5) Control Measures. Res istant vari eties can be selected if this disease becomes ser ious. Fol iar fungicides also are lab eled for stripe rust. f. Pyricularia grisea.10 (1) Disease. Rice Blast (rice). (2) Specific Fungi. Pyricularia grisea. (3) Symptom. Lesions tha t occur on the leaf are usually diamond-shaped with a gray or white center and brown or reddish brown border. Panicle lesions are u sually brown, but may also be black. (4) Transmission. Shortly after the f ungus infects and produces a lesion on rice, fungal strands called \"conidiophores\" grow and produce spores cal led \"conidia.\" These conidia are dispersed in the air. The disease is favored by long periods of free moisture, high humidity, little or no wind at nigh t, and night temperatures between 63 and 73 degrees F. Leaf wetness from dew or other so urces is required for infection. Spor ulation is greatest wh en relative humidity is above 93 percent. (5) Control Measures. Res istant variet ies are available. Con tinuous flooding is recommended to limit blast development. Avoid field drainage, esp ecially for e xtended periods because it allows the formation of nitrate and may cause drought stress. g. Deuterophoma tracheiphila.11 (1) Disease. Citrus. (2) Specific Fungi. Deuterophoma tracheiphila. (3) Symptom. The first symptoms appe ar in the spring, followed by a di eback of twigs an d branches. Gradually, the pathogen affects the entire tree, and it eventually dies. (4) Transmission. Prunings containing affected twigs or bra nches can be a source of in oculum for several week s. The f ungus can sur vive within infected twi gs in the soil for mor e than 4 months. The disease can a lso be trans mitted by rain, hail, an d wind. Dissemination by birds and contaminated ins ects is also suspected. (5) Control Measures. Res istant varieties of lem on trees are available. h. Moniliopht hora roreri.12 (1) Disease. M onilia Pod Rot (cocoa). Monili (3) Symptom. Moniliopht hora roreri co mpletes its entire life cycle on the pods in the tree. There will be conspicuous bumpy swellings on the pod surfaces. Sporulation begins over the pod causing a tan discolor ation within 12 days after pod swellings. (4) Transmission. To mon itor for Mon iliophthora Pod Rot, \"s anitation s weeps\" are made through the p lanting after pod set and should be continued on 7- to 10-day schedules. This is well within infected pod surface sporulation, which disperses s pores throughout the trees during rainy p eriods. (5) Control Measures. Detection of co coa-infected pods and their removal is the real and only key to pes t management. Good surface drai nage and removal of weeds should be practiced on a regular basis. 4. Viral Diseases a. Barley Yellow Dwa rf (BYD) Vi rus.13 (1) Disease. BYD (wheat, barley, and oat). (2) Specific Virus. BYD. (3) Symptom. Symptoms include uneven, blotchy leaf discoloration in various shades of yellow, red, or purple, progressing from leaf tip to base and margin to midrib. The most striking symp toms occur on older le aves Wheat and barley leaves usually turn yellow, while oat leaves are more red. (4) Transmission. Transmitted by more than 20 aphid species (e.g., corn leaf aphid). (5) Control Measures. The main hop e of control of BYD is the use of re sistant varieties. Most of the commercial varieties of oats, barley, and wheat are susceptible to BYD, but so me are less susceptible than others . A number of varieties have been f ound or developed that show some tolerance or resista nce to BYD. Also, avoid very early or very late planting dates duri ng active ap hid populations. b. Banana Bu nchy Top Vi rus (BBTV).14 (1) Disease. BBTV (bana nas). (2) Specific Vir us. BBTV. (3) Symptom. New leaves of infected plants develop dark green streaks. On mature plants, new leaves emerge with di fficulty, are narrower than normal, are wavy rather than flat, and have yellow leaf margins. They appear to be \"bunched\" at the top of the plant. (4) Transmission. BBTV i s transmitted from plant to plant by aphids and transmitted from place to place by people tr ansporting pla nting materials obtained from infected plants. (5) Control Measures. The most important fac tors in controlling this disease are killing the aphid vector and re moving and destroying infected banana plants.

K-6 Appendix L DISSEMINATION OF BIOLOGICAL AGENTS 1. Backgrou nd The term \"d issemination\" refers to the inte ntional release of a biological agent by an adversary s o that it will reach the portals of entry of target personnel in a viable and virulent state. Based on the portals of entry, the characte ristics of agents used, and the results desi red, certain methods of disseminat ion are feas ible for biological attacks. The effectiveness of these methods is determined by physical a nd environmental factors that limit the ab ility of the agent to establish infec tion. Dissemination m ethods are related to the routes of entry thro ugh which pathogens ma y be introduced into the body to establish infection.1 These routes of entry are inhalation, percutan eous, and oral. 2. Inhalation or Aerosol Route of Entr y The primary route of exposure to biological agents is through the respiratory t ract. This would be accomplished by disseminating the agent as an aerosol. An aerosol is comprised of finely divided particle s, either liq uid or solid, suspended in a gaseou s medium. Examples of common aerosols are dust, fog, and smoke. A biological agent aerosol is defined as a n airborne s uspension of particles containing biological ag ents. a. Characteris tics of Aerosol Dissemination. (1) Difficulty of Detection. A biologic al agent aerosol in field concentrations cannot be detected by the physical senses. (2) Capability of Penetration. Aerosol particles tend to diffuse in much the same mann er as a gas. The aerosol cloud travels with the wind and is capable of diffusing into nonairtight structu res that are not e quipped with adequate filtering devices. (3) Difficulty of Diagnosis. The classi cal symptoms of a disease associated with a particular agent can mimic the symptoms of diseases, such as the flu. (4) Increased Severity and Mortality Rate. Certain diseases have altered incubation periods and incapacitation times and increased mortality rates when the agent enters the body throug h the respiratory tra ct. This is the result of the organism diffusing directly int o the bloodstream and being carried by the blood directly t o the body tissues. (5) Massive Overdoses. Personnel mig ht be exposed to massi ve overdoses of an agent throu gh the use of an aerosol. Thus, the acquired immunities of target perso nnel might be overcome by the use of selected agents. (6) Increased Susceptibility. Man has a constant requirement for oxygen ; therefore, he is breathi ng continually. This in creases the probability of contacting an airborne organism. b. Particle Siz e. For the biological ag ent ae rosol to be effective, it must reach targe t personnel. Particle size is a critical factor in lung infections. Particles in the size range from 1 to 5 microns are much more capable of passing through the defensive barriers of the L-1 upper respiratory tract and of bein g retained in the lungs than those below or ab ove this size range. c. Formation of Aerosol Particles. Particl es in the proper size range can be formed by physically breaking up a substance. Th is can be accomplished b y release through a nozzle or a spray or by an explosive force. There are three general me thods of forming biological a gent aerosols\u2014 (1) Generator. Particles ca n be form ed by forcing t he wet (slurry form) ag ent through a nozzle at a re gulated pre ssure. The amount of pressure, the size of the orifices, the viscosity of the agent, and the relative hum idity determine particle size. Size control of solid particles (dry form of agent) can be achieved by presi zing before dissemination. (2) Spra y. Releasing the agent in slu rry form into a high-velocity air stream can produce aerosol par ticles in the proper size range. (3) Explosive Force. Biolo gical agents can be diss eminated by explosive means. The use of a n explosive means for a erosol prod uction is fe asible b ecause large numbers of organisms can be packaged in a munition. The total volume and agent concentrati on will support low efficiencies and still produce aeros ols that result in adeq uate area coverage with high infective dose concentrations. d. Agent Aero sol Stability. From the inst ant an aerosol i s created, certain physical and environmental factors affect its stability. Aerosols ev entually diffuse and become too dilute to be environm ental conditions cause the agent in the aerosol to g radually lose its ab ility to establish infection . This decline in aerosol effectiveness is called the \"aerosol dec ay rate,\" which is usua lly expre ssed as percent decay (dea th) of microorganisms per minute. The decay rate differs from agent to agent and for meteorological conditions. Some of the factors that determine aerosol sta bility are\u2014 (1) Settling. T he rate of fall of the pa rticle is directly related t o its size. The terminal velocity of a 1- to 5-micron particle is relatively small (5 inches per hour for a 1- micron-diameter parti cle in still a ir). This slow settling rate and the presence of convection currents wi thin the tar get area ca use fallout of 1- to 5-micron particl es to be neg ligible. (2) Impaction. As the aerosol cloud moves downwind from its release poi nt, particles wi thin the cloud strike a nd stick to objects in their path. While a number of particles wi ll impact, the overall effect is negligible. (3) UV Radiati on. The UV radiation in sunlight kills microorganisms. In spite of the low penetrating power of UV radiatio n, its killing effect for most pathogens is complete and takes plac e in a relatively sh ort p eriod of time upon direct contac t. (4) Wind Direction and Sp eed. These determine the direction in which th e aerosol clou d will trave l and the si ze of the area that it will cover. Aerosols of biological agents with a high decay rate can b e employ ed effectively at high wind speeds (8 to 18 knots). At these speeds , the aeroso l may be ca rried over extensive areas during the agent's survival period. Low wind speeds decrease down wind tra vel, which reduces area coverage. However, low wind spe eds also tend to lengthen the time the aerosol is on the target and thereby increase the in haled dose i n target personnel. (5) Relative Hu midity and Evaporatio n. Liquid particles in a biological a erosol may be reduced in size by evapora tion. A de crease in the amount of liquid in the particle creates a corresponding increase in the pe rcentage of salts remaining in the liquid L-2 surrounding the agent. This results in incre ased osmotic pressure, which tends to draw fluids out through the cell membr ane and results in dehydration of the living microorganisms. The rate of evaporation is dependent upon the relative humidity and the temperatur e in the env ironment surrounding the particle. Disseminating the ag ents affected during conditions of high relative hum idity reduce s the rate of evaporation. Low relative humidity is conducive to the stability of some b iological agents. These ag ents would be disseminated during condit ions of l ow relative humidity. (6) Temperature. Temperature has littl e direct effect on the living portio n of a biological aerosol. Indirectly, howe ver, an in crease in tem perature is normally followed by an increase in evaporation rate. High tempera tures (170 to 180 degrees F) tend to kill most vegetative bacteria as well as the viral and ri ckettsiae ag ents; however, these temperatures are not normally encountered under field cond itions. Subfreezing temperatures tend to freeze the a erosol (if it is in liquid f orm) af ter its dissemination. This freezing tends to preserve th e agent and decrease its rate of decay. (7) Air Stability. The temperature gradie nt conditions of lap se, inversion, and neutral affect the biological agent aerosol in much the same manner as they affect a chemical agent cloud. Inversion and neutral co nditions are most effe ctive for aerosol travel because the cloud is kept at a height cond ucive to inhalat ion by target personnel. Turbulence, which occurs during lapse conditions, will cause vertical diffusion of the cloud with a resulting loss of agent to higher al titudes and a reduction of area coverage. (8) Precipitation. Heavy and prolonge d precipitation will sub stantially reduce the number of agent particles in the air. The high relative humidity associated with very light rain makes it less important in aeroso l effectiveness than the rainout effect of heavy rainfall. e. Effects of Terrain on Cloud Travel. Terrain affects cloud travel of biol ogical agent aerosols in the sa me general manner as it affects che mical agent clouds. The ground contour of rough terrain creates wind turbul ence, which in turn influences the vertical diffusion of the aerosol cloud. Soil will have an effect onl y as related to heat absorption and reflection, which aid in determining tempera ture gradie nts. 3. Percutaneous Route of Entry A second portal of entry that can be utiliz ed for biological a gent employment is the skin. Penetration of the skin can be acco mplished by the bite of an arthropod ve ctor (carrier), injection, or absorption. a. Arthropod Vector. Th ese insects are capable of transferr ing pathogens to man through bre aks in the skin. For th e purpose of this manual, the definition of \"vector\" is limited to the arthropods. The spread of pa thogens by arthropod vec tors to man is well- established in history. Some examples of ve ctors and the pathogens that they ha ve shown to be capable of transmitting are as follows: (1) Mosquitoes. The virus of yellow fever is transmitted from man to man by the bite of a mosquito. Other impo rtant mosqui to-borne viral diseases are dengue fever and several types of encep halitis. (2) Flies. Most varieties of true flies h ave sucking mouthparts, but those few that have mouthparts capable of piercing the skin of man or animals carry path ogens that cause some of the most feared human diseases. The suck ing flies introduce pathogens L-3 through pre viously injured body surfaces or mechanically transport them on their body surfaces to exposed food and water. Typhoi d fever, bacillary and amoebic dysentery, and Asiatic cholera are examples of dis eases t hat may be spread mechanically by nonbiting flies. Pathogens transp orted by the biting flies include those that cause the dreaded African sleeping sickne ss\u2014an infection of man, domestic animals, and wild game. The vector respo nsible for t his disease is the tsetse fly ( Glossin a morsitan s). Tularemia, a bacterial disease of ma n and wild animals, is sometimes t ransmitted by the deer fly. (3) Lice. Lice are sucking, dorsoven trally flattened, wingless insect parasites of the skin of mammals and birds. The human body lous e, Pediculis humanus , is the vector for the rickettsiae that cause epidemic typhu s and trenc h fever. (4) Fleas. Flea s are small, wingless in sect parasites of the ski n of mammals and birds. Their bodies are flattened laterall y, and they have mouthparts for pi ercing the skin. While different species show preferences for certain hosts, when hungry they will attack any warm-blooded animal. This habit increases their potential to transmit disease to man. The common rat flea, Xenopsylla cheo pis, is the vector of endemic typhu s. (5) Ticks and Mites. These arthropod vectors are known as acarids and are not true insects. As adults, they possess eight legs while insects have six. Most of the se are merely parasitic skin pests of land vertebr ate animals, but a few are important disease vectors. Ce rtain mites transport t he causative organism of scrub typhus. The wood tick, Derm acentor ander soni, indigenous to the western US, is known to tra nsmit to man the rickettsia of Rocky Mou ntain spotted fever, the bacterium of tularemia, and the vir us of Colorado tick fever. b. Injection. Biological a gents can be injected through the skin. In 1978, Bulgarian exile Georgi Mark ov, was attack ed in Lond on, England, wi th a device disguised as an umbrella. The weapon discharged a tiny pellet in the subcutaneous tissue of his leg while he was waiting for a bus. He died days later. The pellet, which conta ined Ricin, was found during auto psy.2 A Flechette is another penetrating devic e. c. Absorption. Biological agents may be absorbe d through the sk in or placed on the skin to do damage to the integument. 4. Oral Route of Entry Another possibility is t hrough the oral rout e by ingestion of contaminated food or water suppl ies. Contamination with toxins of ch lorinated water, river s, lakes, or reservoirs would be difficult because of dilution effects.5 5. Covert Dissemination1 a. Characteris tics. Biological agents lend themselves well to covert or hidden operations because of detection difficulties, th e variety of potential agents, the ways they might be employed, and the small amounts of materials required to cause infection. Sabotage is the direct a pplication, by a person, of material to the targ et. It is generally covert in nature. b. Targets. Covert use of biological a gents might be aimed p rimarily at the respiratory tract and se condly at th e digestive tract. Since many patho gens are spread naturally in food and water, these provide pro ven vehicles in which the saboteur could employ an agent. The respiratory tract is an excellent tar get for the small-scale employmen t of ary 1971. 2BG Russ Z ajtchu k et al.
