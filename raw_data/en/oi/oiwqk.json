They claim that their tests were able to successfully vaccinate mice intranasally \u2014 without any injections. Epoch Times 25\u00a2 Sale: https://ept.ms/RomanSale1 They believe that this will radicalize the way people are vaccinated in the near future. Let's go through their research, as well as the the implications that it has for the next \"vaccination drive\" in this country.

Among them were the overturning of Roe v. Wade, the rejection of President Joe Biden's student loan forgiveness plan, as well as the striking down of affirmative action, which effectively made race-based admissions to college illegal. Epoch Times 25\u00a2 Sale: https://ept.ms/RomanSale1 These decisions have reinvigorated the Democrat-led push to \"rein in\" the Supreme Court. For instance, soon after the Roe v. Wade decision was leaked to the public, the police had to set up a barricade surrounding the Supreme Court building because pro-abortion activists began to file in and protest. Similar situations played out for other decisions as well. Furthermore, it's not just the rank-and-file young people who are out there protesting. Many members of Congress have also come out with strong language opposing the current configuration of the U.S. Supreme Court.

This really appears to be something like a cosmic coincidence\u2014because, at the same time that the presidential election is beginning to gear up, it appears that various mandates are going back into effect. Epoch Times 25\u00a2 Sale: https://ept.ms/RomanSale1 In a previous episode, we already discussed how colleges and businesses were bringing back various aspects of the mandates, such as mask mandates, contact tracing, obligatory COVID tests, and according to No College Mandates (a group that tracks COVID policies in higher education,) there are still over 100 colleges across the country that require students to be vaccinated in order to attend in-person classes. However, since we aired that episode, the list of mandates has actually grown given the fact that several large hospital systems, using a rise in COVID cases as their excuse, have also reinstated mask mandates.

Epoch Times 25\u00a2 Sale: https://ept.ms/RomanSale1 Furthermore, according to new reports, some parts of the wall that have already been built are now being left wide open, allowing people to walk straight in. And the Border Patrol agents are not even able to close the wall because their superiors ordered that the doors be welded open.

After finishing his pilates and spin class while on vacation over in Lake Tahoe, he came out to speak briefly with a gaggle of reporters. Epoch Times 25\u00a2 Sale: https://ept.ms/RomanSale1 And during that brief interaction, he said that he's planning to request more money from Congress to develop a new coronavirus vaccine, adding that it will be for everyone, regardless of whether they've gotten the previous shots or not. He signed off on a proposal to be sent to Congress in order to request funding for developing a new vaccine \"that works,\" adding that it will likely be recommended to everyone, whether they've gotten it before or not. That statement came as a response to the rise in COVID cases that some regions in the country are experiencing, perfectly in time for the upcoming election.

Epoch Times 25\u00a2 Sale: https://ept.ms/RomanSale1 However, the big question that's been hanging in the air ever since these indictments started to roll in was whether there's been collusion between these prosecutors and the White House. Has the White House in any way, shape, or form been involved in these prosecutions against President Trump? The White House has denied any involvement. However, a new bombshell report seems to poke a hole in that well-crafted narrative. A report published first by the New York Post revealed the fact that just a few weeks before they brought charges against President Trump, one of Mr. Smith's top aides had a meeting with the White House Counsel's Office.
