Common sites are the groin, armpit, buttock, thigh or waist. - Shaving is also a risk factor. Common sites are the face, legs, armpits or pubic area. Prevention of Boils - Washing hands is key to preventing Staph skin infections. Have everyone in the home wash their hands often. Use a liquid antibacterial soap or alcohol hand sanitizer. Have everyone shower daily. Showers are best, because baths still leave many Staph bacteria on the skin. - Avoid nose picking. 30% of people have Staph bacteria in their nose. - When shaving anywhere on the body, never try to shave too close. Reason: It causes small cuts that allow Staph bacteria to enter the skin. Prevention - Bleach Baths for Boils that Come Back. - Some doctors suggest bleach baths to prevent boils from coming back. Talk with your doctor about this treatment. - Use \u00bd cup (120 mL) of regular bleach per 1 full bathtub of water. - Soak for 10 minutes twice weekly. - This mix of bleach and water is like a swimming pool.

A gauze pad and tape work well. - Change the bandage twice daily. - Clean the skin around the boil with an antibacterial soap each time. - Carefully throw the bandage away in the regular trash. - Wash your hands well after any contact with the boil, drainage or the bandage. - What to Expect: - Without treatment, the body will slowly wall off the Staph infection. - After about a week, the center of the boil will fill with pus.
