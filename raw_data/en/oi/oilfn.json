The NH Immunization Program (NHIP) is a vaccine resource for healthcare providers, schools, childcare providers, families, and the general public. DHHS, through the NHIP's Vaccines for Children (or \"VFC\") program, provides all the recommended vaccines for every child in the state, regardless of insurance or income. During the COVID-19 pandemic, many children and adults have fallen behind on receiving recommended, routine vaccines. Routine vaccination is rebounding but has not yet recovered among all groups. In addition, while child vaccination coverage remains high nationally and most parents are confident in the safety and effectiveness of vaccines, the spread of myths and misinformation is still a threat to our vaccination rates. Health care providers are prepared to safely give children and adults the vaccines they need. Call your health care provider to be sure you and your family are up-to-date on all [recommended vaccines](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/). If you do not have a health care provider, please call 2-1-1 to find a provider in your area. Vaccine providers: A special issue of [Academic Pediatrics](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/academic-pediatrics/vol/21/issue/4/suppl/S) is now available.

Through a combination of federal, state, and insurance funds, the NHIP's Vaccines For Children (VFC) program is able to provide all NH children from birth through age 18 with all routinely recommended vaccines at no cost to the health care provider or family. In addition, uninsured NH adults may get vaccine at no cost from [providers that offer vaccines for eligible adults at no charge](/sites/g/files/ehbemt476/files/documents/2021-11/immproviders.pdf). Attention Parents and Guardians - Did You Know? In New Hampshire, all children through the age of 18 years are able to receive all recommended vaccines at no cost for the vaccine. No child in New Hampshire can be denied state-supplied vaccine because of their inability to pay an administration fee. How can NH do this? By combining New Hampshire (NH) general funds, federal funds and contributions from health insurance companies that do business in NH, DHHS is able to purchase enough vaccine to provide every NH child with all recommended vaccinations. Health plans have been assisting with funding for many years. How do I take advantage of this? Simply go to your regular health care provider. Your health care provider orders their vaccines from DHHS and will not charge you for those vaccines. No health care provider can turn you away because you can't pay for the provider to give the immunization (known as the \"administration fee\"). However, the health care provider may charge an office visit fee. If you are having trouble affording the office fee for immunization visits, speak with your health care provider about options that may be available to you. What vaccines does the NH Immunization Program provide? For children through age 18, the New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services, Immunization Program (NHIP) provides all the vaccines recommended in the \" [Childhood Immunization Schedule, US.](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/hcp/imz/child-adolescent.html)\" Several major medical groups including the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, the American Academy of Family Physicians and the American Academy of Pediatrics have approved this schedule.
