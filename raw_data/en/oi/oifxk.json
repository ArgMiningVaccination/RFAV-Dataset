These are non-toxic and safe for home use. Some effective ways to get rid of gnats include: - Sticky traps: You can purchase the sticky traps available at retail nurseries and garden centers.

The mixture should contain a few drops of dish soap, a tablespoon of vinegar, and baking soda per cup of water. A few sprays of this mixture is an effective gnat repellent. They may be sprayed in areas where gnats are commonly seen, such as around plants, in the bathrooms, etc. - BTI or Gnatrol: This is a naturally occurring fungus that is toxic to gnat larvae.
