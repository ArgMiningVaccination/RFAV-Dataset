It represents the Medicines Control Council's current thinking on the safety, quality and efficacy of medicines. It is not intended as an exclusive approach. Council reserves the right to request any additional information to establish the sa fety, quality and efficacy of a medicine in keeping with the knowledge current at the time of evaluation. Alternative approaches m ay be used but these should be scientifically and technically justified. The MCC is committed to ensure that all registered medicines will be of the required quality, safety and efficacy. It is important that applicants adhere to the administrative requireme nts to avoid delays in the processing and evaluation of applications.

These Gui delines describe the information required for the registration of \"medicines\" and for an application to amend a registered medicine. The information submitted will be evaluated in terms of the provisions of the Act. The aim of these Guidelines is to assi st applicants in the preparation of documentation for the registration of medicines for human use. The types of medicine include a new medicine for a new chemical entity (NCE), a multisource (generic) product, a product line extension, and a biological medicine. It is a legal requirement that data submitted for evaluation should substantiate all claims and should meet technical requirements of quality , safety and efficacy of the product for the purposes for which it is intended. The Guidelines are meant t o guide the applicant in meeting the requirements of the Act. It is acknowledged, however, that in some instances scientific developments may dictate alternative approaches. When a deviation from a guideline is decided on, a detailed motivation giving th e reason(s) for the deviation and justification for the alternative approach should be included in the expert report submitted with the application. Whenever there is doubt, applicants are advised to consult the Medicines Control Council (MCC) for confirm ation and/or clarification before completing and submitting the application form; refer to the website for contact details. Applicants should always refer to the current version of the relevant Guidelines for the Registration of Medicines and the Addenda thereto before completing the application form. Guidelines are constantly evolving as a result of scientific developments and harmonisation of the requirements of regional and international regulatory authorities. The MCC (Council) endeavours to regularly update the guidelines to reflect current thinking and keep its technical requirements and evaluation policies in line with \"best international medicines regulatory practice\". 2 GENERAL 2.1 SCOPE Legislation requires that the Council shall register ever y medicine before it may be sold/marketed. An application for the registration of a medicine should therefore be submitted for evaluation and approval. These guidelines are relevant only to human medicines including biological and complementary medicines. Separate guidelines apply to the registration of medical devices. Registration of Medicines General Information 2.01_General_information_Jul12_v8_showing_changes.docx August 2012 Page 4 of 34 Back to ToC 2.2 APPLICANT/PROPOSED HOLDER OF THE CERTIFICATE OF REGISTRATION (PHCR) 2.2.1 Eligibility to apply for registration of a medicine is governed by Regulation 22 of the Act. An application may be made by any of the following: a) a person, body corporate/juristic person, company, residing and doing business in South Africa; b) a close corporation incorporated in South Africa; or c) a company in South Africa with at least - a responsible delega ted person residing in South Africa and - an authorised person residing in South Africa who must be a person with appropriate knowledge of all aspects of the medicine and who shall be responsible for communication with Council. 2.2.2 The application submit ted should be signed by the pharmacist authorised to communicate with Council. This pharmacist should be in the full -time employ of the company and may be: the Responsible Pharmacist in terms of the Pharmacy Act, 1974 (Act 53 of 1974) as amended, or another registered pharmacist responsible for regulatory affairs and with appropriate knowledge of all aspects of the medicine. This should be an original signature (scanned signature not acceptable). The following should be included: proof of current registration (copy of certificate) of the pharmacist who signed the dossier, and proof of current registration of the Responsible Pharmacist in terms of Act 53; an individualised, person specific letter of authorisation for the signatory, issued by the person responsible for the overall management and control of the business (CEO). (Note that such a letter is not required for the Responsible Pharmacist if the Responsible Pharmacist signs the application.) 2.2.3 An Applicant/PHCR should submit a Site Master File (SMF) in accordance with the SMF guideline. For subsequent applications reference to the allocated SMF number will suffice. 2.3 CONFIDENTIALITY/SECRECY The confidentiality of information submitted to the MCC is governed by Section 34 of the Act. T he MCC, committee members or staff of the Medicines Regulatory Affairs (MRA), may NOT disclose to any person, any information acquired in the exercise of powers or performance of functions under the Act and relating to the business affairs of any person, except for the purpose of exercising his/her powers, or for the performance of his/her functions under the Act, or when required to do so by any competent court or under any law, or with the written authority of the Director -General, or use such information for self -gain or for the benefit of his employer. The MCC may insist on written confirmation of the identity and affiliation of an individual inquiring telephonically, or in person, about a medicine. No information shall be disclosed te lephonically unless the Medicines Control Officer knows the enquirer is entitled to receive the information. 2.4 LANGUAGE In terms of Regulation 22(4) of the Act, all applications and supporting data submitted to the MCC should be presented in English (B ritish). Original documents not in English should be accompanied by an English translation. Registration of Medicines General Information 2.01_General_information_Jul12_v8_showing_changes.docx August 2012 Page 5 of 34 Back to ToC 2.5 WHERE TO SUBMIT APPLICATIONS Applications should be posted to Private Bag X 828, Pretoria , 0001 or preferably be delivered by the applicant, rather than a courier, to Room NG090 , Civitas Building, Andries Street, Pretoria, where they will be logged and acknowledged. All correspondence should be addressed to the Registrar of Medicines and shou ld be clearly coded as indicated in section 13 of this guideline. The MCC will not take responsibility for documents posted or delivered to any other place or in any other manner. 2.6 WHEN A PRODUCT SHOULD BE REGISTERED A product is liable for registra tion with the Medicines Control Council if any of the following apply. i) Any of the ingredients of a product is listed in one of the Schedules to the Act; ii) The product is a medicine by virtue of the definition of a medicine in the Act. The Act defines a medicine as: \"any substance or mixture of substances used, or purported to be suitable for use, or manufactured or sold for use in; (a) the diagnosis, treatment, mitigation or prevention of disease, abnormal physical or mental state, or the symptoms thereof in man; or (b) restoring, correcting or modifying any somatic or psychic function in man; and includes any veterinary medicine.\" iii) If the product falls under any of the pharmacological classifications as specified in Regulation 25 of the Act. iv) The intended use of a product and the text/words used in promoting the product, even if no claims are reflected on the label, render the produ ct registerable. A substance not ordinarily eaten or drunk by man cannot be considered a foodstuff just because no apparent medicinal claims are made for it. The relevant provisions and guidelines shall apply to a medicine called up as a complementary medicine. 2.7 TYPES OF APPLICATIONS Medicine applications for registration for humans are divided into the following types for the determination of fees and allocation to reviewers for evaluation: 2.7.1 New chemical entity applications that include pre-clinical and clinical information in support of the efficacy and safety of the formulation/dosage form, indication/s and dosage regimen. 2.7.2 Multisource/generic applications and innovator product line extension applications that include clinical information in support of efficacy and safety of the formulation/dosage form, or indication/s or dosage regimen. 2.7.3 Multisource/generic applications and innovator line extension applications that include comparative bio-availability/bioequivalence studies as proof of efficacy. 2.7.4 Multisource/generic applications and innovator line extension applications that include comparative dissolution studies as proof of efficacy that include any other comparative studies as proof of efficacy others, not mentioned above e.g. liquids/solutions. 2.7.5 Biological medicines: Biopharmaceuticals and Biosimilars Biological medicine : A medicine where the active ingredient and/or key excipients have been derived from living organisms or tissues, or manufactured using a biol ogical process. Biological medicines can be defined largely by reference to their method of manufacture (the biological process). These include inter alia medicines prepared from the following substrates: Registration of Medicines General Information 2.01_General_information_Jul12_v8_showing_changes.docx August 2012 Page 6 of 34 Back to ToC 2.7.5 Biological medicines: Biopharmaceuticals a nd Biosimilars - continued (i) Microbial cultures (fermentation); (ii) Plant or Animal Cell cultures (including those resulting from recombinant DNA or hybridoma techniques); (iii) Extraction from biological tissues; and (iv) Propagation of live agents in embryos or animals. The living substrate may be genetically modified in a number of ways to provide the required active ingredient, including recombinant DNA technology or hybridoma techniques . Biological Medicines include, but may not b e limited to the following: (i) Plasma -derived products, e.g. Clotting factors, Immunosera, etc; (ii) Vaccines; (iii) Biotechnology -derived medicinal products factors, Hormones, Cytokines, Enzymes, Monoclonal antibo dies, erythropoietins; (iv) Human Gene therapy. It has been the practice, in South Africa, that Council will decide that certain well -characterised low - molecular weight medicinal biological compounds, such as antibiotics, insulin etc be excluded from biolo gical medicine status, and they are therefore not reviewed by the Biological Medicines Committee. Biopharmaceutical : Patented biological medicine. Biosimilar : A biological medicinal product referring to an existing biological medicinal product for which r egistration has been applied for. 2.8 EVALUATION PROCEDURES Routine Expedited refer point 6 AMRP refer point 7 2.9 FEES The following non -refundable fees are relevant: 2.9.1 A non -refundable screening fee payable with the screening submission. 2.9.2 An application fee payable with the full submission of the application for registration. 2.9.3 A registration fee, payable when the application complies with all the requirements for registration, and which is payable before a registration certificate is i ssued. 2.9.4 An annual retention fee to maintain registration. 2.9.5 A fee to cover any amendments to the dossier or certificate. 2.9.6 A fee to cover any inspection of any manufacturing site. 2.9.7 A fee to cover authorization of the use of an unregistered medicine. 2.9.8 The fees are published in the Government Gazette and are also available on the website. 2.9.9 Methods of payment: By cheque or electronic payment / direct transfer.

Shading and/or coloured filling/background and/or print, e.g. in tables and headers, or across pages, is unacceptable and should be avoided. - have a h eader reflecting the HCR, product name, dosage form and strength. The pages should be numbered according to the MRF1, e.g. 3B.1 (referring to PART 3B, first page). Double -sided copies are allowed required except for those of the package insert and patien t information leaflet. 4.3 The application for registration of a dossier should have clearly labelled tabs to indicate each PART and sub-PART or appendices/documents/reports of the dossier. Responses to recommendations should comply with the format and r equirements of the Amendments guideline. Each part / section of the response should be indicated by clearly labelled tabs. 4.4 Each PART or Sub -PART should contain a Table of Contents complying with 3.1.2 above. 4.5 The application for registration shoul d be properly bound on the left side as this allows for easy update/addition of pages. The left margin of documents should be wide enough to allow for legibil ity after copying and binding. Binding is left to the discretion of the applicant; however, the u se of lever -arch files and ring binders is not accepted and the use of metal fasteners should be avoided regardless of the thickness of the document, as they injure and damage . The binding should enable the easy handling and evaluation of documents withou t it coming apart. The dossier should, therefore, be bound in units not exceeding 4 cm, including the binder, also depending on the binder used. 4.6 All documents and reports included in the registration dossier must comply with the requirements of the SA Guide to GMP Chapter 4 - Documentation, in particular also 4.2.6 and 4.2.7 4.7 Copies of both screening and final submission covering letters in addition to all screening outcome letters should be bound to the application dossier as indicated in the section 5 PRESENTATION OF SCREENING AND POST -SCREENING COPIES of this guideline. 4.8 Cheques or proof of payment should be submitted in a separate envelope attached to the original covering letter. No other documents should be attached. 4.9 The requiremen ts with regard to metrication in accordance with the Trade Metrology Act should be applied in all documentation prepared locally, e.g. the package insert, patient information leaflet, label and completed section of all PARTs of the dossier. 4.10 The boxes in which documentation is submitted to the MCC should be clearly labelled. The following details should appear clearly on each box , preferably on the side : a) Applicant name b) Name of the product (at applicant's discretion) or the applicant's product identif ication code for each application (e.g. NCE -04NOV01) c) The contents of the box, e.g. File numbers, PARTs, Sample, Covering letter, Cheque. d) Number of boxes, e.g. 1 of 10 e) Type of application, e.g. routine, expedited review (fast track), or AMRP. f) Colour stick ers indicating screening (red) or post -screening (green). Registration of Medicines General Information 2.01_General_information_Jul12_v8_showing_changes.docx August 2012 Page 17 of 34 Back to ToC 4 Preparation and submission of an application - continued 4.10 In the case of expedited review (fast track), a copy of the approval letter should be attached in the front of each volume . 4.11 If the application is being submitted simultaneously with one or more additional applications for the identical product this should be stated and also confirmed that the submissions are identical except for the proprietary name. This information should als o be included clearly in the covering letter of each product. 4.12 On receipt at the MCC, all applications for registration will be subject to pre -screening according to the checklist, attachment A, also completed by the applicant. 4.13 Upon successful pr e-screening, the application will be logged onto the system and allocated a screening number. A letter acknowledging receipt of the application and receipt of the screening fee will be issued to the Applicant. 4.14 If the applicant does not comply with the pre -screening requirements the application will be returned to the Applicant as incomplete. 4.15 After successful pre -screening the application will be subjected to screening according to the screening form MRF2. The screening process endeavours to confirm that all the data required have been included and does not involve evaluation of either the data or any motivation for omission of data. Except for the Inspectorate requirements referred to, the MRF2 headings a re in accordance with those of the MRF1 and the questions under each heading are in accordance with the relevant guidelines. Reference to the relevant guidelines should therefore be made if the meaning of any particular question is not clear. Motivation for the omission of data is required. As from 1 July 2010 the pre -screening will become the first part of administrative screening and technical screening will be carried out by the evaluato r before evaluation commences. Omission of critical data or non -compliance with requirements may result in the application being recommended for rejection. For submissions in MRF1 format the applicant should still submit the completed MRF2 form. 4.16 The screening outcomes i.e. HOLD or RETURN AS INCOMPLETE will be comm unicated to the applicant together with reasons. Time frames for the applicant to submit outstanding information, or to collect the application, will also be communicated to the applicant. In the event of a dispute regarding outstanding information or ti me frames, the application will be tabled at the next Council meeting for a formal decision. 4.17 The ACCEPTED screening outcome, the required application fee, and the number of copies will be communicated to the applicant. At this point the application number will also be allocated. Applications for which an expedited review (fast -track) has been approved should be clearly marked. The allocated reference number and a copy of the approval letter should be included and also accompany any subsequent corre spondence regarding an expedited review application. 4.18 The correct number of copies of application and additional documents required for the evaluation of the application, should be submitted in the format detailed in the section 5 PRESENTATION OF SCRE ENING AND POST -SCREENING COPIES of this guideline. This date will be regarded as the date of application. 5 PRESENTATION OF SCREENING AND POST -SCREENING COPIES Certain PARTs of the application for registration should be duplicated and submitted as prescr ibed in the screening approval letter together with the application fee. Cheques or proof of payment should be submitted in a separate envelope attached to the original covering letter. No other documents should be attached.

All queries and concerns should be communicated through the secretariat. The format of respons es to Committees' recommendations and Council resolutions is addressed in the Amendments guideline. 6 EXPEDITED REVIEW PROCESS (FAST -TRACK) The Medicines Control Council may, under certain circumstances, (as in most other national drug regulatory authorities) speed up the registration process for specific medicines that have important therapeutic benefit and which are required urgently to deal with key health problems. In such cases, an accelerated review system is applied. For further informatio n refer to Regulation 5 of the Act. The applicant should submit an expedited review request to the Minister of Health and a copy thereof for the attention of the Registrar of Medicines, before submitting the full application for screening . A copy of the a pproval letter must be submitted with the application. Products that will be considered for expedited review are: Medicines on the Essential Drugs List (EDL) New Chemical Entities that are considered essential for national health but do not appear on the Essential Drugs List. Registration of Medicines General Information 2.01_General_information_Jul12_v8_showing_changes.docx August 2012 Page 20 of 34 Back to ToC 6.1 MEDICINES ON THE EDL A declaration from the applicant that such a medicine appears on the EDL is required. 6.2 NEW CHEMICAL ENTITIES The following should be submitted with the application: A written notification from the Minister to the effect that the medicine is considered essential to national health; an expert report (which is not more than 2 (two) years old; a package insert (where the product has been approved) and a summary basis for the registration (SBRA) (refer to Clinic al guideline for details of an SBRA). The Registrar shall notify the applicant within 30 days of the date of receipt of the application whether or not the application is to be subjected to the expedited registration process as stipulated in Regulation 5 of the Act. The Council may request any information with respect to an application under consideration and the information should be submitted by the applicant within a period indicated by Council, failing which the Council may reject an application. The Cou ncil shall, within 9 months from the date of receipt of the application by the Registrar, make a decision with regard to the application and inform the applicant of such decision. 7 ABBREVIATED MEDICINE REVIEW PROCESS (AMRP) The AMRP is a system initiated by Council to limit the evaluation time of pharmaceutical products that are registered in countries with which the Council aligns itself, if the evaluation report is readily available. The abbreviated medicine review process is based mainly on the expert reports of the pharmaco - toxicological and clinical data. It should be noted that the AMRP is an abbreviated evaluation process and not an abbreviated application . 7.1 Only new chemical entities registered with one or more of the authorities with which the Council aligns itself will qualify for AMRP. (Refer to section 3.1.4 of this guideline). 7.2 The applicant should obtain the Expert Reviewers' reports on safety, quality and efficacy from the relevant medicines regulatory authority. 7.3 The certificate o f approval of registration of the new chemical entity by one of the recognised registering authorities should be included. (Refer to section 3.1.4 of this guideline). 7.4 Written confirmation that the proposed package insert is based on the package insert and the complete dossier of the licensing country is required. Apart from the approved package insert on which the submission is based, the package insert of the other countries where registration has been approved, should also be submitted. 7.5 Written c onfirmation that the data submitted to the MCC are identical to that submitted to the authority which has granted approval should be given. Raw data of experimental and clinical studies should be excluded. A letter authorising the MCC to contact the rele vant MRA for an evaluator's report or assessor's report should be included. 7.6 Expert reports on chemical -pharmaceutical, pharmaco -toxicological and clinical documentation should be included. 7.7 Relevant correspondence between the applicant and the registering authority including the negative (e.g. queries, non -acceptance of certain claims/statements) as well as the positive correspondence should be included. 7.8 Written confirmation that the formulation applied for is identical to that approved by t he registering authority should be given. 7.9 Applications for AMRP can only be accepted if the product has been approved by the said authorities within the last three years of the licence in the licensing country. Registration of Medicines General Information 2.01_General_information_Jul12_v8_showing_changes.docx August 2012 Page 21 of 34 Back to ToC 8 EXPERT REPORTS MRF1 PARTs 2C to E 8.1 Expert report: an objective and encompassing report on all the relevant aspects in the specific field of expertise of the reporter who is familiar/acquainted with the development of the product. 8.2 Expert reviewer's report: the report of the regulatory re viewer, after evaluation of the data submitted in support of approval for licensing. 8.3 All issues and properties of the product in the submission should be clearly identified and critically discussed in the Expert Reports in light of current scientific knowledge. 8.4 The Expert Report should address all the aspects in the package insert. 8.5 A list of the key references used in compiling the Expert Report should be attached. 8.6 The curriculum vitae of the expert should be included. 8.7 If the applicat ion for registration complies with the requirements for the AMRP system, it should be further determined whether the Expert Report reveals all the necessary information for Council to make a considered decision on registration. For this purpose an AMRP -SBRA should be drafted. An AMRP - SBRA should be based on the information in the Expert Reports only. Furthermore, written confirmation that the AMRP -SBRA was compiled from the Expert Report only, should accompany the AMRP -SBRA submission. 9 PROPRIETARY NAME POLICY [Section 15 (3) of the Act] Refer to the current version of the guideline on Proprietary Names for Medicines The term \"PROPRIETARY NAME\" is defined in the Regulations pertaining to the Act as follows: \"PROPRIETARY NAME, in relation to a medici ne, veterinary or complementary medicine and medical device, means a name: a) that is unique to a particular medicine, veterinary, or complementary medicine and medical device; b) that is generally identifiable and approved in respect of that specific medi cine, veterinary, or complementary medicine and medical device in terms of the Act. The Act states that a medicine, complementary medicine, veterinary medicine or device should be registered under such name as the Council may approve. '' In evaluating the safety of a medicinal product during the registration process, the Medicines Control Council is obliged to consider whether the proposed proprietary name of such a product could potentially pose public health and safety concerns or if it may be misleading . Mistaking one drug for another because of similar proprietary names can have serious consequences. Since many medication errors are caused by look -alike and sound -alike medication names, it is evident that public health considerations should be paramo unt in determining whether a particular proprietary name may be used for a medicinal product. In order to enable applicants to propose acceptable proprietary names for medicinal products, it is essential that: a) consistent, non -arbitrary criteria are appli ed when reviewing the acceptability of proposed proprietary names; b) a transparent procedure is in place for evaluating the acceptability of proposed names. The MCC has adopted the WHO naming policy with adaptations. 9.1 SAFETY CONCERNS In assessing the merits of a proposed proprietary name, the first and foremost issue considered is that of patient safety. Applicants are advised to consider the following guidelines bearing in mind the paramount criterion of \"potential safety risk\". Registration of Medicines General Information 2.01_General_information_Jul12_v8_showing_changes.docx August 2012 Page 22 of 34 Back to ToC 9 Proprietary Name Policy - Safety concerns - continued 9.1.1 The proposed proprietary name should not convey misleading therapeutic or pharmaceutical connotations. An example may be the use of the name \"SEDINAX\" for a product intended to treat pain and feve r containing only an analgesic or the name \"PAINKID\" for a product not indicated for paediatric use. Similarly, the name \"CARDIODORON\" should only be used for medicinal products for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. 9.1.2 A proprietary name may inc lude a pharmacological/therapeutic connotation, provided that it is in line with the indications in the package insert. Each application, however, will be evaluated on merit. 9.1.3 It is important to bear in mind the claims made in the package insert in r elation to the proposed name of the product, when considering the acceptability of names, hence the requirement of submission of package inserts in all instances. 9.1.4 The use of \"umbrella/brand types\" of names across products in associated therapeutic ca tegories generally may not pose a problem. However, when such names are used for products in different commodity categories, the misrepresentation of non -medicines as medicines and vice versa would be considered unacceptable. It is the responsibility of applicants to include precautionary statements of usage of these brands, simultaneously, so as to inform patients of their correct use. 9.1.5 The proposed proprietary name should not be misleading with respect to the composition of the product. 9.1.6 The p roposed proprietary name should not be liable to cause confusion in print, handwriting or speech with the proprietary name of another product. 9.1.7 For example, the names \"AMYTAL\" (barbiturate) and \"AMITOL\" (multivitamin) could have serious safety implica tions if a barbiturate is supplied to a patient instead of a vitamin. 9.1.8 When the name being applied for is identical/too similar to a name already approved for another product, applicants will be advised that the proposed name is too close to an existi ng name. Only if the existing product is registered will the name be disclosed. Disputes regarding similarity of names not identified by the Medicines Control Council at the time of registration/change are the responsibility of applicants, not the Medici nes Control Council. If however, valid safety concerns are identified, the applicant will be advised accordingly. 9.1.9 Names which are identical to, or which are similar to, the names of products previously marketed will generally not be favourably consi dered regardless of whether such products are dormant or not. 9.1.10 If an objection is raised on the basis of similarity between the proposed proprietary name and an existing name, or name raising a risk of confusion in print, handwriting or speech, the o bjection will be evaluated taking into account other potentially distinguishing factors, such as: The pharmaceutical form The route of administration The indication and legal status/condition of supply After assessing these factors as a whole, a decision on whether the proposed proprietary name poses a potential safety risk will be made. 9.2 INTERNATIONAL NON -PROPRIETARY NAMES' (INN) CONCERNS The Medicines Control Council subscribes to the WHO guideline in respect of the protection of INN - stems an d encourages the pharmaceutical industry to be continually aware of this issue (Document No. \"WHO/EDM/QSM/99.6\"). 9.2.1 A proprietary name should not contain an INN -stem (as published by the WHO). The WHO stresses the importance of the need to protect IN N-stems. Using a common stem indicates the relationship of pharmacologically related substances, which in turn forms part of the INN name. The orderly development of generic nomenclature could be hindered if these stems are not protected. The sentiments of the WHO in this regard are shared by the MCC, and are taken into consideration when considering proprietary names. Registration of Medicines General Information 2.01_General_information_Jul12_v8_showing_changes.docx August 2012 Page 23 of 34 Back to ToC 9 Proprietary Name Policy - continued 9.2.2 For example, \" -ac\" is an INN -stem for anti -inflammatory agents of the ibufenac group, and a proprietary name ending with \"ac\" would not be acceptable regardless of the API, which it contains. The reasons are protection of the stem and confusion, which could arise if the product does not contain an anti - inflammatory agent of the ibufenac group. 9.2.3 A proprietary name commencing with, or containing \"ac\" in another position within the name could, however, be considered. 9.2.4 The derivation of proprietary names from INN names, i.e. generic names is discouraged, as this practice could lead to confusion. For example, the choice of the name \"METAPERAMIDE\" for a product containing loperamide, could cause confusion if the product c ontains another loperamide -type compound. 9.2.5 If a proprietary name is derived from a generic name, it should not be similar to the generic name, since it can lead to confusion. For example, the name \"TRIMAZOLE\" could be interpreted as being an antipro tozoal of the metronidazole group, an antifungal of the miconazole group or a brand of co - trimoxazole, even though the name does not contain an INN -stem for any of these groups. 9.2.6 In the case of single component generic medicines, applicants are encour aged to market their products under the complete generic name followed or preceded by their company name, acronym or other distinguishing feature. 9.2.7 Exceptions may be considered for the anti -retrovirals if these have been previously approved by a recog nised Regulatory Authority and are accompanied by a motivation. 9.3 OTHER CONCERNS 9.3.1 The issue of whether a particular proprietary name may constitute an infringement of another entity's intellectual property rights cannot be one of the Medicines Cont rol Council's concerns and is, therefore, not taken into account during consideration of the acceptability of a proposed proprietary name. 9.3.2. The proprietary name should preferably consist of only one word and should avoid qualification by letters or n umbers. The use of short qualifications/abbreviations that do not carry an established and relevant meaning is unacceptable. Promotional qualifications/abbreviations/manufacturer's codes are also unacceptable. However, if other qualifications/abbreviati ons are to be included, appropriate justification should be provided (e.g. for insulin mixtures the proprietary name could be followed by a number or letter representing the fast -acting component of the mixture). 9.3.3. The use of descriptive abbreviations may also be acceptable if there is a need to distinguish different routes of administration for the same medicinal product, e.g. IV: intravenous, IM: intramuscular, SC: subcutaneous. 9.3.4 A proprietary name should not convey any promotional message with respect to the use of the product. 9.3.5 Use of capitals in proprietary names should reflect the proposed/approved trademark registration. 9.3.6 A different proprietary name is required for a medicinal product containing a pro -drug of another product containing the parent active substance. (An umbrella name is not acceptable). 9.3.7 In the case of a switch from \"prescription\" to \"non -prescription\" status for limited indications only, a new proprietary name should be chosen for the de -scheduled product. 9.3.8 Any phrase that implies superiority, including use of animal species associated with speed or strength, or implies superiority over other products, is not allowed. 9.3.9 The meaning of abbreviations, symbols, numerals and names, which are in a language other than English, should be explained in the covering letter accompanying an application. With regard to phrases which occur in the proprietary names of products, and which are not English, applicants are requested to submit to the Medicin es Control Council, reputable interpretations / translations / explanations of the phrases in question, in relation to the claims made for the product; i.e. the intended use thereof. Registration of Medicines General Information 2.01_General_information_Jul12_v8_showing_changes.docx August 2012 Page 24 of 34 Back to ToC 9 Proprietary Name Policy - continued 9.3.10 Proprietary names will only be evaluated as part of a new application for registration or application for change. Requests for evaluation of acceptability of possible proprietary names prior to submitting a formal application will not be processed. 9.3.11 Proprietary names cannot b e reserved for applications that have not yet been submitted. 9.3.12 Current policy will not be applicable to line extensions of older products unless a valid safety aspect has come to the fore, in which case, the applicant will be advised accordingly. 9.3.13 A list of names that are regarded as potentially misleading is available on request. Names, which may lead to self -diagnosis in conditions requiring professional diagnosis, or names implying efficacy that cannot be substantiated for the API(s), are i ncluded on this list. 9.3.14 As stated above, legislation determines that the name under which a medicine is registered shall be unique. The importance of this requirement cannot be over -emphasised, particularly when developing a range of products. Each strength and/or dosage form requires a unique name. Applicants should examine all available resources to establish that names are unique. Motivations should accompany applications where relevant, e.g. to justify the use of an identical or very similar na me which appears in Martindale The Complete Drug Reference/other reference book for a product not containing the same ingredient(s) and which may be on the market elsewhere. 9.3.15 As with all registration matters, applicants always have the opportunity t o submit comments in the event of a difference in opinion. Such comments will be forwarded to Council for consideration. 10 MANUFACTURING REQUIREMENTS Only medicines manufactured, packed and quality controlled at sites compliant with the current principles of Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) as prescribed by the Medicines Control Council will be considered for registration. Council's general policy is that the standard to be used to assess compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP ), is the South African Guide to Good Manufacturing Practice (SA guide to GMP) (latest edition) as minuted: \"...that the Guide to Good Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Practice as amended, which was prepared jointly by the secretariat and the PMA, be considered as the standard determined by Council as referred to in the specific condition for registration of a medicine, namely, that the applicant shall ensure that the medicine is manufactured and controlled in accordance with Good Manufacturing Practice as determ ined by Council.\" Under Section 22C of the Act, all South African manufacturers should be licensed (effective 2 May 2004). The aim of these licensing requirements and standards is to protect public health by ensuring that medicines meet defined standards o f quality and are manufactured in conditions that are clean and free of contaminants. The Act requires that overseas manufacturers of medicine supplied to South Africa should comply with the same or equivalent manufacturing standards as expected of South African manufacturers. Evidence in relation to compliance with Good Manufacturing Practices of the overseas manufacturer is required for applications for registration of imported medicines. When acceptable evidence of GMP compliance is not available, ov erseas manufacturers are inspected by the GMP Inspectorate before registration of the medicine is approved. 11 SAMPLES All medicine applications for registration must include a sample of a unit pack, Section 15(1) of the Act.
