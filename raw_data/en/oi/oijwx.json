Introduction The 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pneumonia is an acute respiratory infectious disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, accompanied by fever, dry c ough, and other clinical manifestations [1]. COVID-19 is closely related to the coronavirus that causes severe respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), as all are betacoronaviruses with the same ACE2 receptor [2]. SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respirat ory distress by targeting the lungs and also induces myocardial damage [3,4]. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) is uniquely advantageous for the treatment of viral diseases. Shenshao Ningxin Yin (SNY) is composed of dw forsythia capsule, and honeysuckl e flower (Table 1, Figure 1) and has been patented in China (Patent No. ZL 2020 1 0141213.1). This formula is derived from the Ren Shen Shao Yao decoction that stems from the spl een-stomach theory by Li Dongyuan. The original formula was used for more than 700 years to treat influenza. Dwarf lilyturf tube r has anti-ischemic and anti-inflammatory activities, and al so improves microcirculation as a treatment of cardiovascular diseases [5]. The active components of milkvetch root can improve myocardial injury, activate macrophages, and regulate the human immune response by inducing the release of immune mediators [6-8]. SNY can improve the clinical symptoms of viral myocarditis, as well as reverse arrhythmia and reduce the levels of myocardial damage markers, such as CTNT, LDH, CK and CK- MB [9]. To investigate SNY as a potential treat ment for COVID-19 with myocarditis, a mixture of valuable chemical probes would be required to understand the co mplex biological processes and identify potential therapeutic targ et genes or molecules. Analysis of its underlyi ng mechanism can provide a reference basis for the clinical treatme nt of COVID-19 with myo carditis, and may even reduce mortality and improve pati ent prognosis. However, the specifi c molecular mechanisms have rarely been studied. Table 1. Chinese herbal components contained in Shenshao Ningxin Yin (SNY).

Molecule 5774 Mathematical Bioscien ces and Engineering V olume 19, Issue 6, 5772 -5792. docking uses chemometric methods to simulate the geometry and intermolecular forces of molecules and study the interactions among molecules. The aim is to find the best binding properties between small and large molecules (proteins) with known structures [1 1,12]. Experimentally screening all possible interactions among the ingr edients of compounds and target proteins is impractical, so scientists use computational modelling and network ap proaches that are capable of accurately identifying potential drug-target interactions and serve as a basi s for experimental studies [13,14]. This has been successfully used to illustrate the multitarget effects of TCM compounds for several diseases [15-17]. In this study, we simulated the mechanism of action of SN Y on COVID-19 with myocarditis using a synthetic drug-ingredient-target-pathway netw ork. Finally, molecular docking tech nology was used to verify the main compound-target pairs. Figure 1. Images of the Chinese herbal com ponents in Shenshao Ningxin Yin (SNY). 5775 Mathematical Bioscien Engineering V olume 19, Issue 6, 5772 -5792. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Establishment of the chemical constitu ents and target sites database of SNY Milkvetch root, Chinese magnolia vine fruit, weeping forsythia capsule, and honeysuckle flower were collected by searching the Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology Database and Analysis Platform (TCMSP, http://tcmspw.com/tcmspsea rch.php) [18]. Oral bioavailability (OB) is the percentage of the pha rmaceutical agen t that is used and unc hanged throughout system ic circulation [19,20]. Drug likeness (DL) is a concept of optimized pharmac okinetics and othe r properties, and is widely used during drug development to ev aluate the potential of co mpounds [21]. To identify ingredients that may be absorbed orally and have curative effects, we sele cted the following threshol d conditions for screening active compounds: OB 30% and DL 0.18 [22]. By inputting the active compounds, the putative targets obtained from the DrugBank database were extrac ted from the TCMSP database. The chemical constituents of dwarf lilyturf tuber were collected by searching the Integrative Pharmacology-based Research Platform of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCMIP, http://www.tcmip.cn) [23]. All chemical constituen ts were screened by quantitative estimation of drug- likeness using a QED score, which was calculated according to the Pipeline Pilot ADMET collection model and included aqueous solubility, blood-brain barrier penetration, CYP450 2D6 inhibition, hepatotoxicity, and plasma protein binding. The repo rted mean QED values for attractive and unattract ive components in drug developmen t were 0.67 and 0.49, respectively. The components of dwarf l ilyturf tuber with moderate and good QED scores (QED 0.49) were retained. TCMIP uses a 2D structural similarity search of compounds to predict th e target of the active ingredients using a Tanimoto coefficient similarity score with a drug market ed by the FDA [24]. The Tanimoto Score is in the range of 0-1, where 0 i ndicates completely differ ent structures between ingredients and known drugs, and 1 i ndicates identical structures of two components. The target with a similarity score 0.8 is chosen as a predicted effective component of this Chinese medicine. Using the Uniprot database (https://www.uniprot.org/) [ 25], the targets collected from the TCMSP and TCMSP studies were identified as genes, which al ong with the database of chemical constituents, established the SNY targets. 2.2. Target prediction of COVID-19 with and \"myocarditis\" search COVID-19 with myocarditis. Venny 2.1.0 (https://bioinfogp.cnb.csic.es/tools/venny/ ) was used to map the targets of the effective components of SNY with the target of COVID-19 with myocarditis to analyze the potential targets of SNY for treating this subgroup. 2.3. Network construction of the drug-compound target of SNY An interaction network model was constructe d using Cytoscape3.7.2 (https://cytoscape.org/) using the following nodes: Chinese herbs, compounds , and targets in SNY [28]. Nodes were connected to each other and each node was assigned importa nt network topology parame ters, including degree 5776 Mathematical Bioscien ces and Engineering V olume 19, Issue 6, 5772 -5792. of effect, which can be analyzed using NetworkAna lyzer in Cytoscape3.7.2. Th e larger the number of connected edges, the larger the co rresponding degree, which indicates that the role of the target in the protein interaction netw ork is more important. 2.4. Establishment of a protein-prot ein interaction (PPI) network STRING 11.0 (https://STRING-db.org/) [29] cont ains known and predicted PPIs, where the credibility of the interactions is determined by the confidence level score (highest confidence, 0.9; high confidence or better, 0.7; medium confidence or better, 0.4; low confidence or better, 0.15). SNY targets were introduced into ST RING 11.0 by defining the species as Homo sapiens with the confidence threshold set to 0.7; th e free protein was removed, PPI was obtained, and the TSV format file was saved and imported into Cytoscape3.7.2. The output of the PPI network diagram of the potential targets of SNY was assessed in terms of de gree value and core protei ns were screened out. 2.5. Molecular docking of candidate components and targets Molecular docking is a method used to predict the bind ing affinity and conf ormation of ligands by computing their physical and che mical parameters. Target 3D structure PDB format files were downloaded from RCSB PDB (https://www.rcsb.org/) [ 30], and the SDF format files of candidate compounds were obtained from Pubchem (h ttps://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) [31]. Based on the analysis of the netw ork topological properties of the SNY drug-compound target network, candidate compounds were selected. The core targets were obtained by analyzing the PPI network. ACE2 is a key target for COVID-19 with myocarditis [32,33], so candidate compounds were docked with the core targets and ACE2. Among the different structures of ACE2 in the RCSB PDB database, 1R4L was screened as it has an X-ray di ffraction structure with a resolution of 3.00 \u00c5 without a protein break in the 3D conformation. It al so has a potent inhibitor MLN-4760 (PubChem CID: 448281), which makes key binding interactions within the active site and offe rs insights on the action of specific residues involved in catalysis and substrate specificity [34]. The highly active ingredients reported previously for each target were retrieved from Pubchem and used as reference molecules for comparative study. PYMOL 2.3.0 software (https://pymol.org/) was used for dehydration/ligand/receptor analys is and Autodock 1.5.6 software (h ttp://autodock.scripps.edu) was used to perform hydrogenation/charge calculation for proteins [35]. Pa rameters related to the receptor protein docking site were set to in clude the active pocket sites where small-molecule ligands may bind. The receptor protein and ligand small molecules were converted into pdbqt format and AutoDock Vina 1.1.2 was used to dock the receptor proteins with the small-molecule ligands. 2.6. Bioconcentration analysis of candidate targets To illustrate how a target played a role in the pathway, the Metascape database (https://metascape.org/) for biolog ical process (BP) enrichment an alysis of gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway annotation enrichment analysis were used to analyze the biological processes in which co re targets were involved [36]. Only items with a significance threshold of adjusted p-value < 0.05 were selected. Based on the literature, targets in 20 pathways highly associated with COVID-19 with m yocarditis were sorted and imported as nodes in 5777 Mathematical Bioscien ces and Engineering V olume 19, Issue 6, 5772 -5792. Cytoscape3.7.2. 3. Results 3.1. Active constituents and targets of SNY The chemical constituents and corresponding targets of Chinese angelica, gi nseng, licorice root, white peony root, milkvetch forsythia and honeysuckle flower were obt ained from the TCPSP database, while the components of dwarf lilyturf tuber were retrieved from the TC MIP database. With values of OB > 30%, DL > 0.18, and QED 0.49, a total of 190 active ingredients were screened. Mu ltiple types were included for dwarf lilyturf tuber (17), Chinese angelica (2), ginseng (17), licorice root white peony root (8), milkvetch root (16), magnoliavine fruit (7), weeping forsythia capsule (18), and honeysuckle flower (17). After duplicates were removed, a total of 166 ingredient s were stored for further study (Table S1). The 166 ingredients corresponded to 2133 ac tive targets, down as follo ws: dwarf peony r oot Chinese magnoliavine fruit (10), we eping forsythia capsule (183), and honeysuckle flower (174). After duplicates were removed, a total of 406 target s were stored for further study (Table S2). 3.2. Targets of COVID-19 with myocarditis Figure 2. A total of 148 shared targ ets between Shenshao Ning xin Yin (SNY) and COVID- 19 with myocarditis were identified. The GeneCards and OMIM databases were used to retrieve COVID-19 a nd myocarditis disease targets, respectively. The results of the two databa ses were combined and de -weighted, resulting in 5778 Mathematical Bioscien ces and Engineering V olume 19, Issue 6, 5772 -5792. 663 COVID-19-related genes and 1 125 myocarditis-related genes. Using Venny 2.1.0, the targets of SNY were mapped to the target set of COVID-19 with myocarditis , which resulted in 148 potential targets of SNY (Figure 2, Table S3). 3.3. The drug-compound target network of SNY Duplicates were deleted from the compound and ta rget list and imported into Cytoscape3.7.2 to construct the drug-compound target network (Figur e 3, Table S4). The network consisted of 581 nodes (166 compounds, 406 targets, 9 drugs) and 2999 edges. The V represents the Chinese herb, an ellipse represents the compound, and diamonds represent targets. The larger the node size, the larger the degree value of the node. High-degree nodes we re located at key positions in the network. Cytoscape3.7.2 was used to analyze the topological properties of the network. The compounds in the network were arranged in descending order accordi ng to the degree value, and the compounds in the top 50 were selected as th e candidate compounds of SNY (Table 2). Figure 3.

Construction of the PPI network and screening of key targets The common targets belonging to SNY and COVID-19 with myocarditis were introduced into the PPI network constructed using th e STRING database, which resulted in 134 nodes and 2268 edges in the network (Figure 4A, Table S5). Each node in the network represents a different target. The number of interaction links between the targets is related to the role of the target in drug therapy. In the network, hub genes interact with each other through know n (from curated database s and experimentally determined), predicted (gene neighborhood, fusions , and co-occurrence), and other (text-mining, Four targets (TNF, TP53, AKT1 and STAT3) with the largest degree values ( 57) were selected as core targets (Figure 4B). Figure 4. PPI network and core target degree ranking of Shenshao Ningxin Yin (SNY). 3.5. Verification of docking stimulation Molecular docking experiments included 50 candi date compounds from SNY and core targets of myocarditis (ACE2 [PDB ID: 1R4L]) was selected. The candidate compounds from SNY were al so compared to highly active ingredients reported previously, including TNF/SPD304 (PubChem CI D: The docking score indicates the binding ab ility of the compound to the target, and the smaller the numbe r, the better the combination. Generally, a binding energy -5.0 kJ/mol is considered excellent [42-44]. Most of the 50 candidate compounds had lower binding energies and novel hydrogen bonding interactions with ac tive residues of target receptors compared to the reference molecule (Figure 5, Table S6). The reference molecule scores included TNF/SPD304 50 candidate compounds, the 5781 Mathematical Bioscien ces and Engineering V olume 19, Issue 5772 were significantly better than the binding activity of the reference molecule. The analysis of protein-ligand inte ractions can also help identify ta rget sites. The stability of a protein-ligand complex is predominantly dete rmined by the hydrogen bonds, which are the major stabilizers of the docked comple xes. The binding mode between the small-molecule compound glabrene and the receptor protein TNF involves a mino acid residues Tyr151 and Ser60, which form hydrogen ith glabrene (Figure 6A). The binding mode between the small molecule kanzonol B and TP53 involves residu es Gly188, Ser189, and Ala22, which form hydrogen bond interactions with interactions with kanzonol B (Figure 6B). See Figure 6 for more deta ils. These results suggest that the screened compounds may share a mechanism of act ion with the reference molecules. Figure 5.

Enrichment findings for pivotal targets To elucidate the mechanism of action of the effect of SNY on COVI D-19 with myocarditis, enrichment analysis of GO biological processes was carried out using the Metasc ape database (Figure 7, Table S7). The targets of SNY were mainly invo lved in the inflammatory 0003007), apopt otic signali ng pathway (GO: 0019221). 7. Gene ontology enrichment analysis. According to the KEGG pathway enrichment analys is and the Metascape da tabase, 20 signaling pathways significantly associated with COVID-19 with myocarditis infection were selected and visualized (Figure 8A, Table S8). The targets of SNY for COVID-19 infection were concentrated in the TNF signaling pathway (hsa04668), COVID-19 (hsa05171), Ras secretion (hsa04924), viral myocarditis (hsa05416). Th e results suggest that SNY plays an important role in the tr eatment of COVID-19 with myocarditis through multiple signaling pathways. The overall mechanism of action of SNY was further explored by analyz ing the literature for signaling pathways reported to be associated with COVID- 19 with myocarditis, which produced a potential target point map of key SNY regulation pathways (Figure 8B). Core signaling pathways were integrated and overlapped, and key targets were di splayed more prominently in the signaling pathways. The drug, target, and related SNY signaling pathway were imported into Cytoscape3.7.2 to construct a network graph and visua lize the relationships among components (Figure 9, Ta ble S9). A total of 126 nodes and 505 edges were observed. The network di agram indicates that SN Y is a multi-component, multi-target, and multi-pathway treatment. 5784 Mathematical Bioscien ces and Engineering V olume 19, Issue 6, 5772 -5792. Figure 8.

Discussion COVID-19 is a respiratory disease closely rela ted to inflammation. The inflammatory storm caused by SARS-CoV-2 may spread to the cardiovascular system , causing cardiac immune activation and cardiac dysfunction. In addition, it can lead to target tissue fibr osis and microangiopathy, causing myocardial injury and subsequently leading to myocarditis. Damage to these extrapulmonary organs has become one of the factors a ssociated with death. COVID-19 with myocarditis cann ot be ignored, and therefore, an effective intervention for COVID- 19 with myocarditis is an important way to reduce mortality and improve the prognosis of patients [ 45,46]. TCM has been used as an antiviral, to regulate immunity, and to promote body repair for thousa nds of years [47]. In TCM clinics, SNY is commonly prescribed for the treatment of viral myocardi tis. SNY treatment of COVID-19 with myocarditis involves thousands of complex comp ounds that may act on various key ta rgets and host cell cytokine signaling. A precise SNY therapy requires the identific ation of compounds that play an essential role in the treatment of COVID-19 with myocarditis. Due to the amount of ti me and effort needed to extract and purify natural products, this urgent need was addressed using computati onal methods for networks and molecular docking to facilitate drug desi gn and screening for fu ture experiments. Network analysis demonstrated that of the 166 components of SNY , only quercetin, kaempferol, 5786 Mathematical Bioscien 6, 5772 -5792. luteolin, and formononetin had siza ble interactions with the targ ets of COVID-19 infection with myocarditis. These components exhi bit multiple biologic al activities, including anti-inflammatory, metabolism modulating, ti-oxidation, and an antioxidant anti-inflammatory mechanism [48,49]. Moreover, kaempferol can protect the heart from myo cardial injury in isolated rat hearts through addition, the potential to treat SARS-CoV-2 and improve myocardial injury. Indeed, a pathomorphological study of myocar dial ischemia showed that medi um- and high-dose treatment with formononetin significantly repaired m yocardial injury [51]. Multiple components of SNY act together to treat COVID-19 with myocarditis. The target prot ein levels of TNF, IL6, NFKBIA, and STAT3 were excessively expressed in the PPI network. These re sults indicate a series of SNY targets for the treatment of COVID-19 with myocarditis. The results of GO enrichment analysis indicated that targets were mainly involved in heart development, heart morphogenesis, response to tumor necrosis fa ctor, and regulation of heart contraction force through chemical signaling. These results demonstrate that SNY can treat COVID-19 with myocarditis in multiple ways. IL6 is the cen tral mediator of the cytokine storm, where it orchestrates the proinflammatory responses of immune cells, incl uding the T lymphocytes [52]. This process results in T lymphocyte activation and the release of additional inflammatory cytokines, which in turn stimulates T lymphocytes, leading to a positive feedback loop of immune activation and myocardial damage [53]. Inhibi tion of IL6 can reduce the myocar dial damage caused by COVID-19. NFKBI is a family of transcription factors that regulates the expr ession of various pro- inflammatory cytokines, including IL6 and IL8, whic h are primarily responsible for the cytokine storm in COVID-19. Upon SARS-CoV-2 infection, the TNF signaling pathway is activated, which causes degradation of NFKBI inhibitory protein, resulting in the release an d translocation of NFkB1 to the nucleus for transcription of vari ous cytokine genes [54]. Candid ate compounds bind well to TNF and block the TNF signaling pathways at critical steps, preventing the expr ession of various cytokine genes responsible for the COVID-19 cytokine influx. STAT3 participates in signal transmission for various cytokines and growth factor oncogenes. Its expre ssion reduces inflammatory responses in mice with viral myocarditis [55]. Thus, the comprehensive regulation of TNF, IL6, NFKBIA, and STAT3 may explain the therapeutic effect of SNY on COVID-19 with myocardi tis, although more detailed studies are needed. Our pathway analyses indicate d that cytokine-cytokine r eceptor interaction, Th17 cell differentiation, the IL-17 signaling pathway, and the TNF signaling pa thway were mainly associated with COVID-19 with myocarditis. These results indicate that SNY ma y treat COVID-19 with myocarditis through multiple signa ling pathways closely related to the disease's pathophysiological process. We infer that SNY may reduce the expression of inflammatory cytokine s, inhibit the cascading reaction of an inflammatory out burst, and promote the absorption of inflammatory cells and tissue recovery. Levels of interf eron, tumor necrosis factor, and interleu kin tend to be el evated after SARS- CoV-2 infection, causing the release of large number s of cytokine inflammatory mediators [56]. The cytokine storm and overactivation of immune cells in patients with COVID-19 results in severe acute myocarditis [57-59]. Inflammation can also cause endothelial cell dysfunction, impair the function of cardiac microcirculation, increase the procoagulan t activity of blood, and accelerate heart injury in patients with COVID-19 infection [60,61]. In this study, the renin-angiotensin system (R AS) was found to be an important pathway. RAS 5787 Mathematical Bioscien ces and Engineering V olume 19, Issue 6, 5772 -5792. plays an important role in regula ting blood pressure, electrolyte ba lance, and body fluid balance, and ACE2 is a key target in RAS [62]. Furthermore, we found that glabrone , an active ingredient in SNY, is highly efficient at binding to AC E2, with an absolute binding energy -5.0 kJ/mol. These findings suggest that the active ingredients in SNY may prevent viral entry in to host cells and block binding to ACE2, thereby terminating viral RNA duplication. The RAS system ha s negative regulation points antagonizes ventricular hypertrophy, ventri S protein of SARS-CoV-2 has a high affinity for the ACE2 receptor, which is present on 7.5% of cardiomyocytes. The heart has its own susceptibility to SARS-CoV -2, which may be one of the mechanisms of direct myocardial injury. The upr egulation of ACE2 expression is a compensatory response to myocardial injury a nd has a cardioprotective effect [63-65]. Therefore, SNY can function as a multidirectional intervention of COVID-19 infect ion with myocarditis. There may be other active components and targets in TCMs that have not been experimentally ve rified, suggesting that additional pharmacological mechanisms shou ld be studied. Updating and opti mizing artificial intelligence algorithms and fusing them with multi-modal data can provide new approaches for assessing the complex molecular mechanisms of action of TC Ms with multiple components and targets. 5. Conclusions We investigated the underlying mechanism of SNY for the treatment of COVID-19 with myocarditis by utilizing network co mputational methods. The results provide a reference point for the clinical treatment of COVID-19 with myocarditis and may reduce mortality a nd improve the prognosis of patients. SNY may treat this disease through mechanisms invol ving hub genes (TNF, TP53, AKT1, STAT3 and regulation of the RAS, apoptosis, immune func tion, and inflammatory reactions. This research may facili tate the development of therapeu tic methods that target COVID-19 with myocarditis. That said, extensive experimentati on is necessary to unravel all of the possibilities, including in vivo and in vitro SNY efficacy experiments.
