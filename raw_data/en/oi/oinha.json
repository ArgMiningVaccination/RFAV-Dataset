ROLLINS This Weeks Article In the news Latest Event Clinical Trials No clinical trials at this time. \"A remarkable difference\" How good is the care I get from Dr Rollins and IMC staff? I drive 16 hours round trip and I live an hour from Phoenix. Dr Rollins practices medicine the way i did but also integrates genetics into his treatment plan which I didn't have access to till now. He uses science to integrate lifestyle changes and appropriate supplements and hormones if needed for a truly integrative/holistic approach to getting his patients better. To do that he needs an incredible support staff including Maddie and Gina up front and Morgan for my LDA. My GF has seen a remarkable difference in her health and vitality working with Dr R and his RN's and other counselors. JB, Arizona March 2018 \"Absolutely priceless\" It gives me confidence that wherever life takes me, I will know I have a strong medical team that I can trust behind me. Absolutely priceless!! After so many years of being sick before I found Dr Rollins then the IMC, and countless doctors' not listening to me, I wouldn't give y'all up for anything! VH, Colorado May 2018 \"I am forever grateful!!\" Dr. Rollins truly listens to his patients. If anyone is wondering if paying money for a plane ticket or a long drive to see him is worth it, believe me IT IS WORTH IT!! When you're exhausted, tried everything, and other doctors don't have anything left for you to try, this is the place you need to be. Thank you, Dr. Rollins for helping me be able to live a full life!! I am forever grateful!! KS, Fort Collins January 2018 "}
