Crystals act as conduits for healing \u2014 allowing positive, healing energy to flow into the body as negative, disease-causing energy flows out. Working on our mental, emotional, and spiritual bodies, the goal is to restore balance and harmony throughout these energetic bodies. The unique, innate properties of various crystal formations are harnessed for healing. When a healer places their hands on those stones, this activates the crystals and transmits the necessary energy, or electricity, from that crystal into a client's energy body\u2014the field of energy that surrounds each of us, which is composed of our seven chakras (energy centers) and invisible to most of our non-clairvoyant eyes. Think of the process like you would tuning an instrument, an acupuncturist uses needles, or how a masseuse works with your body during massage. These healing rocks and crystals have their particular vibration and frequency, which arise from their molecular composition which is [scientifically measurable](https://sciencing.com/do-piezoelectric-crystals-work-5132808.html). From the way they move and interact, these vibrations and energies work in benefiting and uplifting our mood, mind, and health, often in the way essential oils and aromatherapy work. Acting like a magnet, crystals can absorb the negative energies on your behalf. Despite the fact that crystal healing has seen an upsurge in popularity during recent years, this alternative treatment is not popular with most medical doctors and scientists, many of whom refer to crystal healing as a pseudoscience. Scientifically speaking, there is no evidence that crystal healing can be used to cure diseases, because diseases have never been recognized by the medical community to be the result of disrupted energetic flow within the body. Furthermore, no scientific studies have shown that crystals and gems can be differentiated by chemical composition or color to treat any particular ailment. Nevertheless, healing crystals remain popular at health spas and at New Age health clinics, sometimes incorporated into related practices of massage and [Reiki](https://www.andreafirpo.com/blog/2019/3/26/what-is-reiki). The use of crystals in such environments help induce relaxation, calmness, and optimal health. Why And How Are Crystals So Powerful? This is where science and mysticism intersect: Crystals are millions of years old and were forged during the earliest part of the earth's formation. I think of crystals as a timeless database of knowledge, because they retain all the information they have ever been exposed to. Crystals absorb information\u2014whether a severe weather pattern, or the experience of an ancient ceremony\u2014and pass it to anyone that comes into contact with them. Crystals are pieces of the Earth with their own gravitational force or energy. Since they are all naturally extracted, they harness the energies of the sun, moon, and oceans (all-natural healing energies) to improve our energetic state. When you place or hold a crystal over the body, it interacts with the body's chakras and promotes physical and mental wellness. Specific crystals can also improve your concentration and creativity while simultaneously promoting physical, emotional and spiritual cleansing. Essentially Crystals vibrate at the same pitch as humans and maximize the healing abilities we already have. Because of this comforting feeling, when you place a crystal on the body, it helps you connect better and feel at ease. Scientifically, crystals are the most orderly structure that exists in nature, meaning they have the lowest amount of entropy (a measurement of disorder). Crystals are structured in such a way that they respond to the inputs of all different energies around them, so they oscillate, emitting specific vibratory frequencies. The way they are balanced, the frequencies they emit, and their ability to store a tremendous amount of information makes crystals essential to modern technologies. This is why there are crystals in computers, TVs, cell phones, satellites, and so on. Crystal quartz is used in high-end watches to ensure precise timekeeping and in microchips for its unmatched storage capabilities. Masterminds, sages, and healers for many generations have been attracted to crystals for burial rites, divination practices, healing rituals, spiritual advancement, and even simply as decoration to connote power. Our ancestors intuitively knew that when worn, the energies of the stones would interact with the human electromagnetic field to bring radical energetic changes. People gravitate towards vortexes (where energy is either entering into the earth or projecting out of the earth's plane) like Stonehenge and Sedona because these ancient and massive magical rocks sit on top of energetic ley lines\u2014making them, in effect, an energy portal or place of power. People choose to wear diamonds as a sign of binding two people together (diamonds are the most indestructible natural substance on earth), and adorn the crowns of royals with crystals. How Do You Choose The Best Crystals For You? Every crystal type has a different purpose, so it depends what you're looking for. Some stones may be best used to heal the body or to tap intuition during meditation, while other stones are used in technology or as a part of building structures. Throughout my travels to metaphysical fairs and events, as well as the [Tucson Gem Show,](https://www.visittucson.org/business/22nd-street-mineral-fossil-gem-show?clientid=27429) I've met vendors from all over the world. I also source my crystals from vendors I trust, who source them ethically. Knowing the lineage of a crystal is somewhat akin to knowing where the food you're consuming comes from, or certifying that your engagement ring isn't a blood diamond. Everything carries an energy in it; you want to have the most positive, clean, and clear energies in your crystal. I always ask crystal store owners where they get their stones, how they harvest the stones, and if they know any physical history about the stone I am choosing. Most importantly, though: If a crystal is yours, then it will speak to you. The stone may get hot in your hand, it can send tingles into your arm, or you might feel a third-eye buzz. Trust your intuition when a stone is yours. If it doesn't feel quite right, then go with your gut\u2014it's not meant for you. If you feel that a crystal is yours, but it's physically dirty or maybe just needs an energetic bath, you can follow the steps for purification. In a time where good energy is needed more than ever, we can discover the use of healing crystals and how they can improve your body's energetic flow. What Are Some Of The Healing Benefits Of Using Crystals? In the world of alternative medicine, crystals are said to have healing properties that-when holding them or placing them on your body-can promote physical, emotional and spiritual healing. Crystals are used to interact with your body's energy field, also known as an individual's chakra. Crystals are a conduit for energy that can be utilized for clearing stale energy in your home or workplace, and are great talismans for helping children and adults sleep. There are multiple benefits of using crystals, they can help to raise energy in our homes and offices, attract personal and professional wealth, ward off negative energy, support health, prevent disease, manifest visions and dreams, forecast the future and help you feel and look fabulous! Is There A Specific Way To Use Crystals? The best crystal for you at any time depends on what you want to achieve. If you want to bring more love and compassion into your life and relationships, wear Rose Quartz as a pendant near your heart center. If you want to bring more abundance and wealth into your life use Citrine stones as bracelets or rings or place the stones in your office. Or, if you want to work with your body's Chakra system, match the crystals to the Chakras points to increase their energy and support the energy flow in your body. We have a natural affinity for crystals that are good for us as individuals. You would likely be uncomfortable working with someone else's crystal or one that doesn't suit you. When you find one you like, there are simple methods of clearing the residual energy from its 'past life' thus being presented with an empty crystal, like a secondhand computer that is wiped clean of information so that you can start afresh. Cleanse them with smudging herbs such as White Sage and Palo Santo, as soon as you purchase or receive them. Program them with your intention like love, abundance or protection. Every few weeks, cleanse and charge again. Some crystals love water and the sun, others don't. It's important to learn how to take care of your crystals to extend their life and effectiveness. If you are interested in learning more about crystal healing, I have ordered a Forsyth Crystal Light Table, and once it arrives will be adding Forsyth Crystal Light Table sessions to my [offerings page](https://www.andreafirpo.com/offerings) in the future. The [Forsyth Crystal Light Table\u00a9](https://russellforsyth.com/forsyth-crystal-light-table/) is a unique energy tool, invented by Russell Forsyth, that combines ancient wisdom with modern modalities to bring balance and harmony to the human body. Russell received visions of blueprints during channeling sessions with the angels and, as a former builder, acted on the inspiration to create this unique device. "}
