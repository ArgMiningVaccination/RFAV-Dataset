Technical/Scientific Program Contact s: Dr. William Spotz William.Spotz@science.doe.gov Dr. Hal Fink el Hal.Finkel@science.doe.gov STATUTORY AUTHORITY Section 646 of Public Law 95-91, U.S. Department of Energy Organization Act Section 901 et seq. of Public Law 109-58, Energy Policy Act of 2005 APPLICABLE REGULATIONS Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards, codified at 2 CFR 200 U.S. Department of Energy Financial Assistance Rules, codified at 2 CFR 910 U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science Financial Assistance Program Rule, codified at 10 CFR 605 SUMMARY The DOE SC program in Advanced Scientific Computing Research (ASCR) hereby announces its interest i n research applications to explore potentially high -impact approaches in the development and use of data reduction techniques and algorithms to facilitate more efficient analysis and use of massive data sets produced by observations, experiments and simulation. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION Scientific observations, experiments, and simulations are producing data at a rate beyond our capacity to s tore, analyze, stream, and archive. This data almost always contains redundancies and trivialities that hide the important information of interest to scientists. Of necessity, many research groups have already begun reducing the size of their data sets via techniques such as comp ression, reduced order mod els, experiment -specific triggers, filtering, and feature extraction. These efforts should be expanded to include mathematical rigor to ensure that scientifically -relevant constraints on quantities of inter est are satisfi ed, to be integrated into scientific workflows, and to be implemented in a manner that inspires trust that the desired information is preserved. 2 The drivers for data reduction techniques constitute a broad and diverse set of scientific disciplines that cover every aspect of the DOE scientific mission. An incomplete list includes light sources, accelerators, radio astronomy, cosmology, fusion, climate, materials, combustion, the power grid, and genomics , all of which have either observatories, experimental facilities, or simulation needs that produce unwieldy amounts of raw data. ASCR is interested in algorithms, techniques, and workflows that can reduce the volume of such data , and that have the potential to be broadly applied to more than one application. Applicants who submit a pre -application that focuses on a single science application may be discouraged from submitting a full proposal. Accordingly, a virtual DOE workshop entitled \"Data Reduction for Science\" was held in January of 2021, resulting in a brochure [1] detailing four priority research directions (PRDs) identified during the workshop. These PRDs are (1) effective algorithms and tools that can be trusted by scientists for accuracy and efficiency , (2) progressive red uction algorithms that enable data to be prioritized for efficient streaming , (3) algorithms which can preserve information in features and quantities of interest with quantified uncertainty , and (4) m apping t echniques t o new architectures and use cases . The principal focus of this Program Announcement is to support applied mathematics and computer science approaches that address one or more of the identified PRDs. Significant innovations will be required in the development of effective paradigms and appro aches for realizing the full potential of data reduction for scien ce. Proposed research should not focus only on particular data sets from specific applications, but rather on creating the body of knowledge and understanding that will inform future scienti fic advances. Consequently, the funding from this Announcement is not intended to incrementally extend current research in the area of the proposed project. Rather, the proposed projects must reflect viable strategies toward the potential solution of chall enging problems in data reduction for scien ce. It is expected that the proposed projects will significantly benefit from the exploration of innovative ideas or from the development of unconventional approaches. Proposed approaches may include innovative research with one or more key characteristics, such as comp ression, reduced order models , experiment -specific triggers, filtering, and feature extraction , and may focus on cross -cutting concepts such as scientific machine learning or trust . Preference may be given to pre -applications that include reduction estimates for at least two science applications.

These objectives may be met through any number of mechanisms including, but not limited to, data access plans, data sharing agreements, the use of archives and repositories, and the use of various licensing schemes. The use of the phrase \"open -source \" does not refer to any particular licensing arrangement, but is to be understood as encompassing any arrangement that furthers the objective of openness. Applications from for -profit organizations that propose research related to current commercial activity may be declined without merit review. Multi -Instit utional Teams SC uses two different mechanisms to support teams of multiple institutions. COLLABORATIVE APPLICATIONS Collaborative applications will not be accepted under this FOA. SUBAWARDS Multi -institutional teams may submit one application from a designated lead institution with all other team members proposed as sub recipient s. DOE National Laboratories, other Federal agencies, and another Federal agency's FFRDCs1 may be proposed as sub recipient s. Note that the value of any such proposed subaward may be removed from any such prime award: DOE may make separate awards to Federally affiliated institutions. 1 An authoritative list of all Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs) may be found at https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/ffrdclist/ 4 Section II - AWARD INFORMATION A.

Do not submit a scanned image of a printed document. PRE-APPLICATION REVIEW Program Managers may evaluate all or some portion of pre -applications to determine their competitiveness within a scientific topic. Any review will be based on the following criteria: 1. Responsiveness to the objectives of the FOA. 2. Scien tific and technical merit. 3. Appropriateness of the proposed research approaches. 4. Likelihood of scientific impact. Any such review will be conducted by no less than three federal program managers chosen for their topical knowledge and diversity of perspecti ve. Reviews within a topical field will be a comparative review with priority given to scientifically innovative and forward -looking basic research with the highest likelihood of success as an application. The results of the review will be documented. Applicants with the highest rated pre -applications will be encouraged to submit applications; others will be discouraged from submitting applications. Written feedback will be provided after the deadline for the receipt of applications. Topics with compar atively few pre -applications may not make use of such pre -application reviews. The ratio of encourage/discourage results will differ between topical subjects. SC is committed to ensuring that a sufficient number of applicants will be encouraged to submit applications to foster a competitive merit review of the applications. DOE expects to allow approximately 30 proposals, with the exact number based on the review. SC's intent in discouraging submission of certain applications is to save the time and effort of applicants in preparing and submitting applications with a negligible likelihood of success. The PI will be automatically notified when the pre -application is encouraged or discouraged. The DOE SC Portfolio Analysis and Management System (PAMS) will s end an email to the PI from PAMS.Autoreply@science.doe.gov , and the status of the pre -application will be updated at the PAMS website https://pamsp ublic.science.energy.gov/ . Notifications are sent as soon as the decisions to encourage or discourage are finalized. 11 PRE-APPLICATION SUBMISSION The pre -application must be submitted electronically through the DOE SC Portfolio Analysis and Management Syste m (PAMS) website https://pamspublic.science.energy.gov/ . The Lead Institution on the application must be the same as on the pre -application. The Principal Investigator should not be changed unless unavoidable and only minor edits should be made, if necessary, to the title. If necessary, the applicant may make changes to other senior/key personnel and other participating institutions, although DOE discourages extensive changes. Applicants are encoura ged to inform the DOE Program Manager listed as this FOA's Technical/Scientific Program Contact of such changes. Detailed instructions about how to submit a pre -application are in Section VI II of this FOA. C.

To attach a Project Narrative, click \"Add Attachment. \" The Project Narrative comprises the research plan for the project. It sh ould contain enough background material in the Introduction, including a brief review of the relevant literature and any prior research in this area , to demonstrate sufficient knowledge of the state of the science. The major part of the narrative should be devoted to a description and justification of the proposed project, including details of the method to be used. It should also include a timeline for the major activities of the proposed project, and should indicate which project personnel will be respons ible for which activities. There should be no ambiguity about which personnel will perform particular parts of the project, and the time at which these activities will take place. The following organization of the Project Narrative is suggested: Background/Introduction : Explanation of the importance and relevance of the proposed work as well as a review of the relevant literature. Progress Report (for Renewal Applications Only): The Project Narrative of a renewal application must include a separat e section that includes a description of results of the work accomplished during the current project period (since the last new or renewal award) , an analysis of how the results relate to the activities proposed to be undertaken during the renewal period , and a description of any changes that affected the overall direction of the research being performed . Project Objectives: This section should provide a clear, concise statement of the specific 15 objectives/aims of the proposed project. Proposed Research and Methods : Identify the hypotheses to be tested (if any) and details of the methods to be used including the integration of experiments with theoretical and computational research efforts. The Project Narrative is considered the intellectual work of the proposed researchers. Concurrent submission of the same or substantially similar narratives attributed to different researchers may constitute academic dishonesty or research misconduct.

AGENCY CONTACT S Grants.gov William.Spotz@science.doe.gov Dr. Hal Finkle Hal.Finkle@science.doe.gov 29 Section VIII - SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL A. HOW -TO GUIDES 1. How to Distinguish Between a New and Renewal Application New Application: An application must be submitted as \"new\" in the following circumstances: When applying for funding to create a new research award that has not previously received DOE funding, including any funding for the current year. When applying for funding to suppo rt continued research from the same applicant institution as the current grant but with a significant change in fundamental nature of the research. When applying for funding to support continued research supported by an existing DOE award but at a new appl icant institution. Renewal Application: A renewal application is appropriate when funds are requested for an award that has no changes in the following items: The recipient/applicant institution The award's senior leadership The fundamental nature of the award A change in an award's PI does not necessarily require submission as a new application: The change in personnel must be considered in light of other changes. Renewal applications compete for funds with all other peer -reviewed applications and must be developed as fully as though the applicant were applying for the first time. Renewal applications must be submitted by the same sponsoring institution as that holding the current grant award for which renewal funding is requested, and the proposed resea rch topic must be logical scientific extensions of the research that has been performed in the current award. For renewal applications only, the PI is required to submit a Renewal Proposal Products section through SC's PAMS website at https://pamspublic.science.energy.gov . The PI must enter into PAMS each product created during the course of the previous project period. Types of products include publications, intellectual property, tec hnologies or techniques, and other products such as databases or software. As soon as the renewal application is assigned to a program manager, the PI will receive an automated email from PAMS (< PAMS.Au toreply@science.doe.gov >) instructing him or her to navigate to the PAMS Task tab to complete and submit the Renewal Proposal Products. The submitted product list will be sent for merit review as part of the application. The application will not be conside red complete and cannot be sent for review until the product list has been submitted. 2. How Federally Affiliated Organizations May Participate and Be Funded VALUE /FUNDING FOR DOE/NNSA NATIONAL LABORATORIES AND NON-DOE/NNSA FFRDC S For grant awards, the value of, and funding for, a DOE/National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) National Laboratory contractor, a non -DOE/NNSA Federally Funded Research and 30 Development Center (FFRDC) contractor, or another Federal agency's portion o f the work will not be included in the award to the successful applicant. DOE will fund a DOE/NNSA National Laboratory contractor through the DOE field work authorization system or other appropriate process and will fund non -DOE/NNSA FFRDC contractors and other Federal agencies through an interagency agreement in accordance with the Economy Act, 31 USC 1535, or other statutory authority. RESPONSIBILITY The successful prime applicant/awardee (lead organization) will be the responsible authority regarding the settlement and satisfaction of all contractual and administrative issues, including but not limited to, disputes and claims arising out of any agreement between the applicant and any team member, and/or sub recipient . If an award is made to a DOE/NNSA National Laboratory, all Disputes and Claims will be resolved in accordance with the terms and conditions of the DOE/NNSA National Laboratory's management and operating (M&O) contract, as applicable, in consultation between DOE and the prime awardee. If an award is made to another Federal agency or its FFRDC contractor, all Disputes and Claims will be resolved in accordance with the terms and conditions of the interagency agreement in consultation between DOE and the prime awardee. 3. How Federally Affiliated Organizations May App ly DOE/NNSA NATIONAL LABORATORY CONTRACTORS DOE/NNSA National Laboratory Contractors, if eligible either as a prime applicant or a proposed team member on another entity's application, should ensure that their cognizant DOE/NNS A Contracting Officer provides written authorization. This authorization should be submitted with the application as part of the Budget Justification for DOE/NNSA National Laboratory Contractor File. [This is not required for the National Energy Technology Laboratory because it is a Government Owned/Government Operated (GOGO).] Please note that failure to provide this authorization may result in rejection of an application prior to merit review. If a DOE/NNSA National Laboratory Contractor is selected for a ward, or proposed as a team member, the proposed work will be authorized under the DOE field work authorization system or other appropriate process and performed under the laboratory Contractor's M&O contract, as applicable. The following wording is accept able for the authorization: \"Authorization is granted for the _____________ Laboratory to participate in the proposed project. The work proposed for the laboratory is consistent with or complementary to the missions of the laboratory and will not adversel y impact execution of the DOE/NNSA assigned programs at the laboratory.\" NON-DOE/NNSA FFRDC S 31 Non-DOE/NNSA FFRDCs, if eligible either as a prime applicant or a proposed team member on another entity's application, should follow the following guidelines: The prime applicant must obtain written authorization for non -DOE/NNSA FFRDC participation. The cognizant Contracting Officer for the Federal agency sponsoring the FFRDC contractor must authorize in writing the participation of the FFRDC contractor on the proposed project and this authorization should be submitted with the application. The written authorization must also contain a determination that the use of a FFRDC contractor is consistent with the contractor's authority under its award and does not plac e the FFRDC contractor in direct competition with the private sector, in accordance with FAR Part 17.5. Please note that failure to provide this authorization may result in rejection of an application prior to merit review. The following wording is accepta ble for the authorization: \"Authorization is granted for the _____________ Laboratory to participate in the proposed project. The work proposed for the laboratory is consistent with or complementary to the missions of the laboratory and will not adversely impact execution of the (insert agency) assigned programs at the laboratory. This laboratory is authorized to perform the work proposed in the application submitted under DOE Funding Opportunity Announcement <<Include the FOA number on the cover page>> by the following statutory authority (insert statute name, citation, and section) .\" OTHER FEDERAL AGENCIES Other Federal Agencies , if eligible either as a prime applicant or a proposed team member on another entity's application, must include in their budg et justifications any specific statutory authorization (other than the Economy Act) that permits their receipt of an Inter -Agency Agreement or that authorizes the payment of certain costs. 4. How Consortia May be Used INCORPORATED CONSORTIA Incorporated consortia, which may include domestic and/or foreign entities, are eligible to apply for funding as a prime recipient (lead organization) or sub recipient (team member). Each incorporated consortium must have an internal governance structure and a written set of internal rules. Upon request, the consortium must provide a written description of its internal governance structure and its internal rules to the DOE Contracting Officer. There is no requirement that subawards be formalized into incorporated consortia. UNINCORPORATED CONSORTIA Unincorporated consortia (team arrangements), which may include domestic and foreign entities, must designate one member of the consortium to serve as the prime recipient/consortium representative (lead organization). There is no requirement that subawards be formalized into unincorporated consortia . 32 Upon request, unincorporated consortia must provide the DOE Contracting Officer with a collaboration agreement, commonly referred to as the articles of collaboration, which sets out the rights and responsibili ties of each consortium member. This agreement binds the individual consortium members together and should discuss, among other things, the consortium's: Management structure; Method of making payments to consortium members; Means of ensuring and overse eing members' efforts on the project; Provisions for members' cost sharing contributions; and Provisions for ownership and rights in intellectual property developed previously or under the agreement. Note that a consortium is applied for in one applica tion and results in one award with subawards to consortia members. Multi -institutional teams may, if permitted under this FOA, submit collaborative applications with each institution submitting its own application with an identical research narrative, resu lting in multiple awards to the collaborating institutions. 5. How to S ubmit Letters of Intent Do not submit an LOI unless an FOA requires or allows their submission. It is important that the LOI be a single file with extension .pdf, .docx, or .doc. The filename must not exceed 50 characters. The PI and anyone submitting on behalf of the PI must register for an account in PAMS before it will be possible to submit a letter of intent. All PIs and those submitting LOIs on behalf of PIs are encouraged to est ablish PAMS accounts as soon as possible to avoid submission delays. You may use the Internet Explorer, Firefox, Google Chrome, or Safari browsers to access PAMS. Submit Your Letter of Intent: Create your letter of intent outside the system and save it as a file with extension .docx, .doc, or .pdf. Make a note of the location of the file on your computer so you can browse for it later from within PAMS. Log into PAMS and click the Proposals tab. Click the \"View / Respond to Funding Opportunity Announcemen ts\" link and find the current announcement in the list. Click the \"Actions/Views\" link in the Options column next to this announcement to obtain a dropdown menu. Select \"Submit Letter of Intent\" from the dropdown. On the Submit Letter of Intent page, selec t the institution from which you are submitting this LOI from the Institution dropdown. If you are associated with only one institution in the system, there will only be one institution in the dropdown. Note that you must select one and only one PI per LOI ; to do so, click the \"Select PI\" button on the far right side of the screen. Find the appropriate PI from the list of all registered users from your institution returned by PAMS. (Hint: You may have to sort, filter, or search 33 through the list if it has mu ltiple pages.) Click the \"Actions\" link in the Options column next to the appropriate PI to obtain a dropdown menu. From the dropdown, choose \"Select PI.\" If the PI for whom you are submitting does not appear on the list, it means he or she has not yet reg istered in PAMS. For your convenience, you may have PAMS send an email invitation to the PI to register in PAMS. To do so, click the \"Invite PI\" link at the top left of the \"Select PI\" screen. You can enter an optional personal message to the PI in the \"Comments\" box, and it will be included in the email sent by PAMS to the PI. You must wait until the PI registers before you can submit the LOI. Save the LOI for later work by clicking the \"Save\" button at the bottom of the screen. It will be stored in \"My Le tters of Intent\" for later editing. Enter a title for your letter of intent. Select the appropriate technical contact from the Program Manager dropdown.

Please pay attention to the deadline. 6. How to Submit a Pre -Application Do not submit a pre -application unless an FOA requires or permits their submission. It is important th at the pre -application be a single file with extension .pdf, .docx, or .doc. The filename must not exceed 50 characters. The PI and anyone submitting on behalf of the PI must register for an account in PAMS before it will be possible to submit a pre -applic ation. All PIs and those submitting pre -applications on behalf of PIs are encouraged to establish PAMS accounts as soon as possible to avoid submission delays. You may use the Internet Explorer, Firefox, Google Chrome, or Safari browsers to access PAMS. 34 Submit Your Pre -Application: Create your pre -application (called a preproposal in PAMS) outside the system and save it as a file with extension .docx, .doc, or .pdf. Make a note of the location of the file on your computer so you can browse for it later fr om within PAMS. Log into PAMS and click the Proposals tab. Click the \"View / Respond to Funding Opportunity Announcements\" link and find the current announcement in the list. Click the \"Actions/Views\" link in the Options column next to this announcement to obtain a dropdown menu. Select \"Submit Preproposal\" from the dropdown. On the Submit Preproposal page, select the institution from which you are submitting this preproposal from the Institution dropdown. If you are associated with only one institution in the system, there will only be one institution in the dropdown. Note that you must select one and only one PI per preproposal; to do so, click the \"Select PI\" button on the far right side of the screen. Find the appropriate PI from the list of all register ed users from your institution returned by PAMS. (Hint: You may have to sort, filter, or search through the list if it has multiple pages.) Click the \"Actions\" link in the Options column next to the appropriate PI to obtain a dropdown menu. From the dropdo wn, choose \"Select PI.\" If the PI for whom you are submitting does not appear on the list, it means he or she has not yet registered in PAMS. For your convenience, you may have PAMS send an email invitation to the PI to register in PAMS. To do so, click the \"Invite PI\" link at the top left of the \"Select PI\" screen. You can enter an optional personal message to the PI in the \"Comments\" box, and it will be included in the email sent by PAMS to the PI. You must wait until the PI registers before you can sub mit the preproposal. Save the preproposal for later work by clicking the \"Save\" button at the bottom of the screen. It will be stored in \"My Preproposals\" for later editing. Enter a title for your preproposal. Select the appropriate technical contact from the Program Manager dropdown. To upload the preproposal file into PAMS, click the \"Attach File\" button at the far right side of the screen. Click the \"Browse\" (or \"Choose File\" depending on your browser) button to search for your file. You may enter an op tional description of the file you are attaching. Click the \"Upload\" button to upload the file. At the bottom of the screen, click the \"Submit to DOE\" button to save and submit the preproposal to DOE. Upon submission, the PI will receive an email from the PAMS system <PAMS.Autoreply@science.doe.gov > acknowledging receipt of the preproposal. You are encouraged to register for an account in PAMS at least a week in advance of the preproposal submission de adline so that there will be no delays with your submission. WARNING : The PAMS website at https://pamspublic.science.energy.gov will permit you to edit a previously submitted pre -application in the ti me between your submission and the deadline. If you choose to edit, doing so will remove your previously submitted version from consideration. If you are still editing at the time of the deadline, you will not have a valid submission. Please pay attention to the deadline. 7. How to Register and Submit an A pplication in Grants.gov 35 This section provides the application submission and receipt instructions for applications to SC. Please read the following instructions carefully and completely. ELECTRONIC DELIVERY SC is participating in the Grants.gov initiative to provide the grant community with a single site to find and apply for grant funding opportunities. SC requires applicants to submit their applications online through Grants.gov. HOW TO REGISTER TO APPLY THROUGH GRANTS .GOV a. Instructions: Read the instructions below about registering to apply for SC funds. Applicants should read the registration instructions carefully and prepare the information requested before beginning the registration process. Reviewing and assembling the required information before beginning the registration process will alleviate last -minute searches for required information. Organizations must have a Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) Number, active System for Award Mana gement (SAM) registration, and Grants.gov account to apply for grants. If individual applicants are eligible to apply for this FOA, then you may begin with step 3, Create a Grants.gov Account, listed below. Creating a Grants.gov account can be completed o nline in minutes, but DUNS and SAM registrations may take several weeks. Therefore, an organization's registration should be done in sufficient time to ensure it does not impact the entity's ability to meet required application submission deadlines. Compl ete organization registration instructions can be found on Grants.gov here: https://www.Grants.gov/web/grants/applicants/organization -registration.html 1) Obtain a DUNS Number : All entities applying for funding, including renewal funding, must have a DUNS Number from Dun & Bradstreet (D&B). Applicants must enter the DUNS Number in the data entry field labeled \"Organizational DUNS\" on the SF -424 form. For more detail ed instructions for obtaining a DUNS Number, refer to: https://www.Grants.gov/web/grants/applicants/organization -registration/step -1-obtai n- duns-number.html 2) Register with SAM : All organizations applying online through Grants.gov must register with SAM at https://www.sam.gov . Failure to register with SAM will prevent your organization from applying thro ugh Grants.gov. SAM registration must be renewed annually. For more detailed instructions for registering with SAM, refer to: https://www.Grants.gov/web/grants/applicants/organization -registration/step -2-register - with-sam.html 36 3) Create a Grants.gov Account : The next step is to register an account with Grants.gov. Follow the on -screen instructions or refer to the detailed instru ctions here: https://www.Grants.gov/web/grants/applicants/registration.html 4) Add a Profile to a Grants.gov Account : A profile in Grants.gov corresponds to a single applicant organization the user represents (i.e., an applicant) or an individual applicant. If you work for or consult with multiple organizations and have a profile for each, you may log in to one Grants.gov account to access all of your grant applications. To add an organizational profile to your Grants.gov account, enter the DUNS Number for the organization in the DUNS field while adding a profile. For more detailed instructions about creating a profile on Grants.gov, refer to: https://www.Grants.gov/web/grants/applicants/registration/add -profile.html 5) EBiz POC Authorized Profile Roles : After you register with Grants.gov and create an Organization Applicant Profile, the or ganization applicant's request for Grants.gov roles and access is sent to the Electronic Business Point of Contact (EBiz POC). The EBiz POC will then log in to Grants.gov and authorize the appropriate roles, which may include the Authorized Organization Re presentative (AOR) role, thereby giving you permission to complete and submit applications on behalf of the organization. You will be able to submit your application online any time after you have been assigned the AOR role. For more detailed instructions about creating a profile on Grants.gov, refer to: https://www.Grants.gov/web/grants/applicants/registration/authorize -roles.html 6) Track Role Status : To track your role request, refer to: https://www.Grants.gov/web/grants/applicants/registration/track -role-status.html b. Electronic Signature : When applications are submitted through Grants.gov, the name of the organization applicant with the AOR role that submitted the application is inserted into the signature line of the application, serving as the electronic signature. The EBiz POC must authorize people who are able to make legally binding commitments on behalf of the organization as a user with the AOR role; this step is often missed and it is crucial for valid and timely submissions. HOW TO SUBMIT AN APPLICATION TO SC VIA GRANTS .GOV Gran ts.gov applicants can apply online using Workspace. Workspace is a shared, online environment where members of a grant team may simultaneously access and edit different webforms within an application. For each FOA, you can create individual instances of a workspace. Below is an overview of applying on Grants.gov. For access to complete instructions on how to apply for opportunities, refer to: https://www.Grants.gov/web/grant s/applicants/apply -for-grants.html 1) Create a Workspace: Creating a workspace allows you to complete it online and route it through your organization for review before submitting. 37 2) Complete a Workspace: Add participants to the workspace, complete all the required forms, and check for errors before submission. a. Adobe Reader: If you decide not to apply by filling out webforms you can download individual PDF forms in Workspace so that they will appear similar to other Standard forms. The individual PD F forms can be downloaded and saved to your local device storage, network drive(s), or external drives, then accessed through Adobe Reader. NOTE: Visit the Adobe Software Compatibility page on Grants.gov to download the appropriate version of the software at: https://www.Grants.gov/web/grants/applicants/adobe -software -compatibility.html b. Mandatory Fields in Forms: In the forms, you will note fields marked wit h an asterisk and a different background color. These fields are mandatory fields that must be completed to successfully submit your application. c. Complete SF -424 Fields First: The forms are designed to fill in common required fields across other forms, such as the applicant name, address, and DUNS number. To trigger this feature, an applicant must complete the SF -424 information first. Once it is completed, the information will transfer to the other forms. 3) Submit a Workspace: An application may be s ubmitted through workspace by clicking the Sign and Submit button on the Manage Workspace page, under the Forms tab. Grants.gov recommends submitting your application package at least 24 -48 hours prior to the close date to provide you with time to correct any potential technical issues that may disrupt the application submission. 4) Track a Workspace: After successfully submitting a workspace package, a Grants.gov Tracking Number (GRANTXXXXXXXX) is automatically assigned to the package. The number will be listed on the Confirmation page that is generated after submission. For additional training resources, including video tutorials, refer to: https://www.Grants.gov/web/gra nts/applicants/applicant -training.html Applicant Support: 1 -800- 518-4726 and email at support@Grants.gov . For questions related to the specific grant opportunity, contact the number listed in the application package of the grant you are applying for. If you are experiencing difficulties with your submission, it is best to call the Grants.gov Support Center and get a ticket number. The Support Ce nter ticket number will assist SC with tracking your issue and understanding background information on the issue. TIMELY RECEIPT REQUIREMENTS AND PROOF OF TIMELY SUBMISSION 38 Proof of timely submission is automatically recorded by Grants.gov. An electronic date/time stamp is generated within the system when the application is successfully received by Grants.gov. The applicant AOR will receive an acknowledgement of receipt and a tracking number (GRANTXXXXXXXX) from Grants.gov with the successful transmission of their application. Applicant AORs will also receive the official date/time stamp and Grants.gov Tracking number in an email serving as proof of their timely submission. When SC successfully retrieves the application from Grants.gov, and acknowledges t he download of submissions, Grants.gov will provide an electronic acknowledgment of receipt of the application to the email address of the applicant with the AOR role. Again, proof of timely submission shall be the official date and time that Grants.gov re ceives your application. Applications received by Grants.gov after the established due date for the program will be considered late and may not be considered for funding by SC. Applicants using slow internet, such as dial -up connections, should be aware t hat transmission can take some time before Grants.gov receives your application. Again, Grants.gov will provide either an error or a successfully received transmission in the form of an email sent to the applicant with the AOR role. The Grants.gov Support Center reports that some applicants end the transmission because they think that nothing is occurring during the transmission process. Please be patient and give the system time to process the application. 8. How to Prepare an Application APPLICATION PREPARATION You must submit the application through Grants.gov at https://www.Grants.gov/ , using either the online webforms or downloaded forms. (Additional instructions are provided in 7., above .) You are required to use the compatible version of Adobe Reader software to complete a Grants.gov Adobe application package. To ensure you have the Grants.gov compat ible version of Adobe Reader, visit the software compatibility page at https://www.Grants.gov/web/grants/applicants/adobe -software -compatibility.html . You must c omplete the mandatory forms and any applicable optional forms (e.g., Disclosure of Lobbying Activities (SF -LLL)) in accordance with the instructions on the forms and the additional instructions below. Files that are attached to the forms must be PDF files unless otherwise specified in this FOA. Attached PDF files must be plain files consisting of text, numbers, and images without editable fields, signatures, passwords, redactions, or other advanced feat ures available in some PDF - compatible software. Do not use PDF portfolios or binders. Please note the following restrictions that apply to the names of all files attached to your application: Please limit file names to 50 or fewer characters Do not attac h any documents with the same name. All attachments must have a unique name. 39 Please use only the following characters when naming your attachments: A -Z, a-z, 0-9, underscore, brackets, ampersand, tilde, exclamation point, comma, semi colon, apostrophe, at sign, number sign, d ollar sign, percent sign, plus sign, and equal sign. Attachments that do not follow this rule may cause the entire application to be rejected or cause issues during processing. RENEWAL APPLICATIONS For renewal applications only, the PI is required to sub mit a Renewal Proposal Products section through the PAMS website at https://pamspublic.science.energy.gov . The PI must enter into PAMS each product created during the course of the previous project peri od. Types of products include publications, intellectual property, technologies or techniques, and other products such as databases or software. As soon as the renewal application is assigned to a DOE Program Manager, the PI will receive an automated email from PAMS (<PAMS.Autoreply@science.doe.gov >) instructing him or her to navigate to the PAMS Task tab to complete and submit the Renewal Proposal Products. The submitted product list will be sent for me rit review as part of the application. The application will not be considered complete and cannot be sent for review until the product list has been submitted. RESUBMISSION OF APPLICATIONS Applications submitted under this FOA may be withdrawn from consi deration by using the PAMS website at https://pamspublic.science.energy.gov . Applications may be withdrawn at any time between when the applicant submits the application and when DOE makes the applicati on available to merit reviewers. Such withdrawals take effect immediately and cannot be reversed. Please exercise due caution. After the application is made available to merit reviewers, the applicant may contact the DOE program office identified in this F OA to request that it be withdrawn. After an application is withdrawn, it may be resubmitted, if this FOA is still open for the submission of applications. Such resubmissions will only count as one submission if this FOA restricts the number of applicatio ns from an applicant. Note that there may be a delay between the application's submission in Grants.gov and when it is available to be withdrawn in PAMS. SC will usually consider the last submission, according to its Grants.gov timestamp, to be the intend ed version. Please consult with your program manager to resolve any confusion about which version of an application should be considered. IMPROPER CONTENTS OF APPLICATIONS Applications submitted under this FOA will be stored in controlled -access systems , but they may be made publicly available if an award is made. As such, it is critical that applicants follow these guidelines: Do not include information subject to any legal restriction on its open distribution, whether classified, export control, or unc lassified controlled nuclear information. Do not include sensitive and protected personally identifiable information, including social security numbers, birthdates, citizenship, marital status, or home addresses. Pay particular 40 attention to the content of biographical sketches and curriculum vitae. Do not include letters of support from Federal officials. Do not include letters of support on Federal letterhead. Letters that are not letters of support (such as letters confirming access to sites, facilities, equipment, or data; or letters from cognizant contracting officers) may be on Federal letterhead. Clearly mark all proprietary or trade -secret information. CHANGE OF AWARDEE INSTITUTION If an awardee chooses to relinquish an award made under this FOA to permit the transfer of the award to a new institution, the new institution must submit an application under the then - available SC \"annual\" or \"open\" FOA. 9. How to Prepare a Biosketch A biosketch is to provide information that can be used by reviewers to evaluate the PI's potential for leadership within the scientific community. Examples of information of interest are invited and/or public lectures, awards received, scientific program committees, conference or workshop organization, professional society a ctivities, special international or industrial partnerships, reviewing or editorship activities, or other scientific leadership experiences. SC requires the use of the format approved by the National Science Foundation (NSF), which may be generated by the Science Experts Network Curriculum Vita (SciENcv), a cooperative venture maintained at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sciencv/ , and is also available at https://nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/nsfapprovedformats/biosketch.pdf . The use of a format required by another agency is intended to reduce the administrative burden to researchers b y promoting the use of common formats. The biographical information (curriculum vitae) must include the following items within its page limit: Education and Training : Undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral training, provide institution, major/area, degr ee and year. Research and Professional Experience : Beginning with the current position list, in chronological order, professional/academic positions with a brief description. Publications : Provide a list of up to 10 publications most closely related to the proposed project. For each publication, identify the names of all authors (in the same sequence in which they appear in the publication), the article title, book or journal title, volume number, page numbers, year of publication, and website address if av ailable electronically. Patents, copyrights and software systems developed may be provided in addition to or substituted for publications. An abbreviated style such as the Physical Review Letters (PRL) convention for citations (list only the first author) may be used for publications with more than 10 authors. Synergistic Activities : List no more than five professional and scholarly activities related to the effort proposed. In addition, the biographical sketch must include information to permit DOE to identify 41 individuals who are conflicted with or potentially biased (favorably or unfavorably) against the investigator. Include a section entitled \" Identification of Potential Conflicts of Interest or Bias in Selection of Reviewers \" that will not count in a page limit. Provide the following information in this section: Collaborators and Co -editors : List in alphabetical order all persons, including their current organizational affiliation, who are, or who have been, collaborators or co -authors with you on a research project, book or book article, report, abstract, or paper during the 48 months preceding the submission of this application. For publications or collaborations with more than 10 authors or participants, only list those individuals in the core grou p with whom the PI interacted on a regular basis while the research was being done. Also, list any individuals who are currently, or have been, co -editors with you on a special issue of a journal, compendium, or conference proceedings during the 24 months preceding the submission of this application. If there are no collaborators or co -editors to report, state \"None.\" Graduate and Postdoctoral Advisors and Advisees : List the names and current organizational affiliations of your graduate advisor(s) and princ ipal postdoctoral sponsor(s). Also, list the names and current organizational affiliations of your graduate students and postdoctoral associates. Personally Identifiable Information : Do not include sensitive and protected personally identifiable informati on including social security numbers, birthdates, citizenship, marital status, or home addresses. Do not include information that a merit reviewer should not make use of. 10. How to Prepare Current and Pending Support WARNING : These instructions have been significantly revised to require disclosure of a variety of potential conflicts of interest or commitment, including participation in foreign government -sponsored talent recruitment programs . Current and Pending support is intended to allow the ident ification of potential duplication, overcommitment, potential conflicts of interest or commitment, and all other sources of support. The PI and each senior/key person at the prime applicant and any proposed subaward must provide a list of all sponsored act ivities, awards, and appointments, whether paid or unpaid; provided as a gift with terms or conditions or provided as a gift without terms or conditions ; full - time, part -time, or voluntary; faculty, visiting, adjunct, or honorary; cash or in -kind; foreign or domestic; governmental or private -sector; directly supporting the individual's research or indirectly supporting the individual by supporting students, research staff, space, equipment, or other research expenses. All foreign government -sponsored talent recruitment programs must be identified in current and pending support. SC requires the use of the format approved by the National Science Foundation (NSF), which may be generated by the Science Experts Network Curriculum Vita (SciENcv), a cooperative ven ture maintained at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sciencv/ , and is also available at https://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/nsfa pprovedformats/cps.pdf . The use of a format required by another agency is intended to reduce the administrative burden to researchers by promoting the use of common formats. For every activity, list the following items: 42 The sponsor of the activity or the source of funding The award or other identifying number The title of the award or activity. If the title of the award or activity is not descriptive, add a brief description of the research being performed that would identify any overlaps or synergies with the proposed research. The total cost or value of the award or activity, including direct and indirect costs. For pending proposals, provide the total amount of requested funding. The award period (start date - end date). The person -months of effort per y ear being dedicated to the award or activity If required to identify overlap, duplication of effort, or synergistic efforts, append a description of the other award or activity to the current and pending support. Details of any obligations, contractual o r otherwise, to any program, entity, or organization sponsored by a foreign government must be provided on request to either the applicant institution or DOE. 11. How to Prepare a Data Management Plan In general, a DMP should address the following requir ements: 1. DMPs should describe whether and how data generated in the course of the proposed research will be shared and preserved . If the plan is not to share and/or preserve certain data, then the plan must explain the basis of the decision (for example, cost/benefit con siderations, other parameters of feasibility, scientific appropriateness, or limitations discussed in #4). At a minimum, DMPs must describe how data sharing and preservation will enable validation of results, or how results could be validated if data are not shared or preserved. 2. DMPs should provide a plan for making all research data displayed in publications resulting from the proposed research open, mach ine-readable, and digitally accessible to the public at the time of publication. This includes data that are displayed in charts, figures, images, etc. In addition, the underlying digital research data used to generate the displayed data should be made as accessible as possible to the public in accordance with the principles stated in the Office of Science Statement on Digital Data Management ( https://science.osti.gov/fun ding- opportunities/digital -data-management . This requirement could be met by including the data as supplementary information to the published article, or through other means. The published article should indicate how these data can be accessed. 3. DMPs should consult and reference available information about data management resources to be used in the course of the proposed research. In particular, DMPs that explicitly or implicitly commit data management resources at a facility beyond what is conve ntionally made available to approved users should be accompanied by written approval from that facility. In determining the resources available for data management at Office of Science User Facilities, researchers should consult the published description o f data management resources and practices at that facility and reference it in the DMP. Information about other Office of Science facilities can be found at https://science.osti.gov/user -facilities/ . 4. DMPs must protect confidentiality, personal privacy, Personally Identifiable Information , and U.S. national, homeland, and economic security; recogni ze proprietary interests, business confidential information, and intellectual property rights; avoid significant negative impact 43 on innovation, and U.S. competitiveness; and otherwise be consistent with all applicable laws, and regulations. There is no req uirement to share proprietary data. DMPs will be reviewed as part of the overall SC research proposal merit review process. Applicants are encouraged to consult the SC website for further information and suggestions for how to structure a DMP: https://science.osti.gov/funding -opportunities/digital -data-management 12. How to Prepare a Research and Related Budget and Justification The following advice will improve the a ccuracy of your budget request: Funds requested for personnel (senior, key, and other) must be justified as the product of their effort on the project and their institutional base salary. Funds requested for fringe benefits must be calculated as the produc t of the requested salary and, if present, the negotiated fringe benefit rate contained in an institution's negotiated indirect cost rate agreement. Funds requested for indirect costs must be calculated using the correct indirect cost base and the negotiat ed indirect cost rate. You are encouraged to include the rate agreement used in preparing a budget as a part of the budget justification. Do not prepare a budget justification using the expired DOE form F4260.1. If you are proposing indirect costs and do not already have an Indirect Cost Rate Agreement with your Cognizant Federal Agency or documentation of rates accepted for estimating purposes by DOE or another Federal agency, it is recommended that you begin preparing an Indirect Cost Rate Proposal to be submitted, upon request, to the DOE contract specialist/grants management specialist who will evaluate your application if you are selected for award. For your convenience in preparing an Indirect Cost Rate proposal, a link to applicant resources, includ ing indirect rate model templates, has been provided below: https://science.osti.gov/sbir/applicant -resources/grant -application/ . Budget Fields Section A Senior/Key Person For each Senior/Key Person, enter the requested information. List personnel, base salary, the numb er of months th at person will be allocated to the project, requested salary, fringe benefits, and the total funds requested for each person. The requested salary must be the product of the base salary and the effort. Include a written narrative in the budget justi fication th at justi fies the need for requested personnel. Within the justification, explain the fringe benefit rate used if it is not the standard faculty rate. Section B Other Personnel List personnel, the numb er of months th at person will be allocated to the project, requested salary fringe benefits, and the total funds requested for each person. Include a written narrative in the budget justification th at fully justifies the need for requested personnel. Within the justification, provide the 44 number of positions being filled in each category of other personnel. Section C Equipment For the purpose of this budget, equipm ent is d esignated as an item of property that has an acquisition cost of $5,000 or more and an expected service life of more than one year, unless a different threshold is specified in a negotiated Facilities and Administrative Cost Rate . (Note that this d esignation applies for propos al budgeting only and di ffers from the DOE d efinition of capital equipm ent.) List each item of equipm ent separately and justi fy each in the budget justi fication section. Do not aggregate items of equipment.

How to R egister in PAMS After you submit your application through Grants.gov, the application will automatically transfer into the Portfolio Analysis and Management System (PAMS) for processing by the DOE SC. Many functions for grants and c ooperative agreements can be done in PAMS, which is available at https://pamspublic.science.energy.gov . You will want to \"register to\" your application: a process of linking yourself to the application after it has been submitted through Grants.gov and processed by DOE. You must register in PAMS to submit a pre -application or a letter of intent. You may use the Internet Explorer, Firefox, Google Chrome, or Safari browsers to access PAMS. Notifications sent from the PAMS system will come from the PAMS email address <PAMS.Autoreply@science.doe.gov >. Please make sure your email server/software allows delivery of emails from the PAMS email address to yours. Registering to PAMS is a two -step process; once you create an individual account, you must associate yourself with (\"register to\") your institution. Detailed steps are listed below. CREATE PAMS ACCOUNT : To register, click the \"Create New PAMS Account\" link on the website https://pamspublic.science.energy.gov/ . Click the \"No, I have never had an account\" link and then the \"Create Account\" button. You will be prompted to enter your name and email address, create a username and password, and select a security question and answer. Once you have done this, click the \"Save and Continue\" button. On the next page, enter the required information (at least on e phone number and your mailing address) and any optional information you wish to provide (e.g., FAX number, website, mailstop code, additional email addresses or phone numbers, Division/Department). Click the \"Create Account\" button. Read the user agreem ent and click the \"Accept\" button to indicate that you understand your responsibilities and agree to comply with the rules of behavior for PAMS. PAMS will take you to the \"Having Trouble Logging In?\" page. (If you have been an SC merit reviewer or if you h ave previously submitted an application, you may already be linked to an institution in PAMS. If this happens, you will be taken to the PAMS home page.) 47 REGISTER TO YOUR INSTITUTION : Click the link labeled \"Option 2: I know my institution and I am here to register to the institution.\" (Note: If you previously created a PAMS account but did not register to an institution at that time, you must click the Institutions tab and click the \"Register to Institution\" link.) PAMS will take you to the \"Register to Institution\" page. Type a word or phrase from your institution name in the field labeled, \"Institution Name like,\" choose the radio button next to the item that best describes your role in the system, and click the \"Search\" button. A \"like\" search in PAMS returns results that contain the word or phrase you enter; you do not need to enter the exact name of the institution, but you should enter a word or phrase contained within the institution name. (If your institution has a frequently used acronym, such as ANL for Argonne National Laboratory or UCLA for the Regents of the University of California, Los Angeles, you may find it easiest to search for the acronym under \"Institution Name like.\" Many institutions with acronyms are listed in PAMS with their acronym s in parentheses after their names.) Find your institution in the list that is returned by the search and click the \"Actions\" link in the Options column next to the institution name to obtain a dropdown list. Select \"Add me to this institution\" from the d ropdown. PAMS will take you to the \"Institutions - List\" page. If you do not see your institution in the initial search results, you can search again by clicking the \"Cancel\" button, clicking the Option 2 link, and repeating the search. If, after searching , you think your institution is not currently in the database, click the \"Cannot Find My Institution\" button and enter the requested institution information into PAMS. Click the \"Create Institution\" button. PAMS will add the institution to the system, associate your profile with the new institution, and return you to the \"Institutions - List\" page when you are finished. For help with PAMS, click the \"External User Guide\" link on the PAMS website, https ://pamspublic.science.energy.gov/ . You may also contact the PAMS Help Desk, which can be reached Monday through Friday, 9 :00 AM - 5:30 PM Eastern Time. Telephone: (855) 818 - 1846 (toll free) or (301) 903 -9610, email: sc.pams -helpdesk@science.doe.gov . All submission and inquiries about this FOA should reference the FOA number printed on the cover page. 13. How to View Applications in PAMS Each Grants.gov application submitted to the DOE SC automatical ly transfers into PAMS and is subsequently assigned to a program manager. At the time of program manager assignment, the three people listed on the SF -424 (R&R) cover page will receive an email with the subject line, \"Receipt of Proposal 0000xxxxxx by the DOE Office of Science.\" These three people are the PI (Block 14), Authorized Representative (Block 19), and Point of Contact (Block 5). In PAMS notation, applications are known as proposals, the PI is known as the PI, the Authorized Representative is known as the Sponsored Research Officer/Business Officer/Administrative Officer (SRO/BO/AO), and the Point of Contact is known as the POC. There will be a period of time between the application's receipt at Grants.gov and its assignment to a DOE SC program man ager. Program managers are typically assigned two weeks after 48 applications are due at Grants.gov: please refrain from attempting to view the proposal in PAMS until you receive an email providing the assignment of a program manager. Once the email is sent, the PI, SRO/BO/PO, and POC will each be able to view the submitted proposal in PAMS. Viewing the proposal is optional. You may use the Internet Explorer, Firefox, Google Chrome, or Safari browsers to access PAMS. Following are two sets of instructions f or viewing the submitted proposal, one for individuals who already have PAMS accounts and one for those who do not.

Administrative Requirements The administrative requirements for DOE grants and cooperative agreements are contained in 2 CFR 200 as modified by 2 CFR 910 ( DOE Financial Assistance Regulations). 2. Availability of Funds Funds are not presently available for this award. The Government's obligation under this award is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for award purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the DOE C ontracting Officer for this award and until the awardee receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the DOE C ontracting o Officer. 52 3. Conference Spending (February 2015) The recipient shall not expend any funds on a conference not directly and programmatically related to the purpose for which the grant or cooperative agreement was awarded that would defray the cost to the United States Government of a conference hel d by any Executive branch department, agency, board, commission, or office for which the cost to the United States Government would otherwise exceed $20,000, thereby circumventing the required notification by the head of any such Executive Branch departmen t, agency, board, commission, or office to the Inspector General (or senior ethics official for any entity without an Inspector General), of the date, location, and number of employees attending such conference. 4. Commitment of Public Funds (a) A DOE fi nancial assistance award is valid only if it is in writing and is signed, either in writing or electronically, by a DOE Contracting Officer. (b) Recipients are free to accept or reject the award. A request to draw down DOE funds constitutes the Recipien t's acceptance of the terms and conditions of this Award. 5. Corporate Felony Conviction and Federal Tax Liability Representations (March 2014) In submitting an application in response to this FOA the Applicant represents that: It is not a corporation that has been convicted of a felony criminal violation under any Federal law within the preceding 24 months, It is not a corporation that has any unpaid Federal tax liability that has been assessed, for which all judicial and administrative remedies have been exhausted or have lapsed, and that is not being paid in a timely manner pursuant to an agreement with the authority responsible for collecting the tax liability. For purposes of these representations the following definitions apply: A Corporation includes any entity that has filed articles of incorporation in any of the 50 states, the District of Columbia, or the various territories of the United States [but not foreign corporations]. It includes both for -profit and non -profit organizations. 6. Environmental, Safety and Health (ES&H) Performance of Work at DOE Facilities With respect to the performance of any portion of the work under this award which is performed at a DOE -owned or controlled site, the recipient agrees to comply with all state an d Federal ES&H regulations, and with all other ES&H requirements of the operator of such site. Prior to the performance on any work at a DOE -Owned or controlled site, the recipient shall contact the site facility manager for information on DOE and site s pecific ES&H requirements. The recipient shall apply this provision to all sub recipient s at any tier. 7. Federal, State, and Local Requirements 53 With respect to the performance of any portion of the work under this award, the recipient agrees to comply with all applicable local, state, and Federal ES&H regulations. The recipient shall apply this provision to all rsubrecipients at any tier. 8. Fund ing Restrictions Funding for all awards and future budget periods are contingent upon the availability of funds appropriated by Congress for the purpose of this program and the availability of future -year budget authority. Cost Principles : Costs must be allowable, allocable and reasonable in accordance with the applicable Federal cost principles referenced in 2 CFR 200 as modified by 2 CFR 910 (DOE Financial Assistance Regulation). Pre-award Costs : Recipients may charge to an award resulting from this FO A pre -award costs that were incurred within the ninety (90) calendar day period immediately preceding the effective date of the award, if the costs are allowable in accordance with the applicable Federal cost principles referenced in 2 CFR 200 as modified by 2 CFR 910 (DOE Financial Assistance Regulation). Recipients must obtain the prior approval of the DOE C ontracting Officer for any pre-award costs that are for periods greater than this 90 day calendar period. Pre-award costs are incurred at the applicant's risk. DOE is under no obligation to reimburse such costs if for any reason the applicant does not receive an award or if the award is made for a lesser amount than the applicant expected. 9. National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) Compliance If question 4.a. on the \"Research and Related Other Project Information\" document indicates \"potential impact on the environment\", or if DOE's own review indicates it, DOE may ask the applicant to provide additional information on those impacts in order to prepare an environmental critique/synopsis per 10 CFR 1021.216. Note that this pre -award environmental critique/synopsis process would be separate from the preparation of a NEPA document such as an environmental impact statement (EIS) or an environmenta l assessment (EA). If DOE determines the latter documentation is necessary, this process would need to be completed, funded by and with the participation of the awardee, prior to them taking any action on the proposed project that could have adverse enviro nmental effects or that could limit the choice of reasonable alternatives. Note that in most cases, even when \"Potential Impact to the Environment\" is checked \"Yes,\" preparation of such NEPA documents is rarely necessary, but DOE has the expectation that t he Applicant will disclose the potential, which would serve to initiate dialog with DOE if necessary. The inability to satisfy the NEPA requirements after an award would result in cancellation of the award. 10. Nondisclosure and Confidentiality Agreements Representations (June 2015) In submitting an application in response to this FOA the Applicant represents that: 54 (1) It does not and will not require its employees or contractors to sign internal nondisclosure or confidentiality agreements or statements prohibiting or otherwise restricting its employees or contactors from lawfully reporting waste, fraud, or abuse to a designated investigative or law enforcement representative of a Federal department or agency authorized to receive such information. (2) It does not and will not use any Federal funds to implement or enforce any nondisclosure and/or confidentiality policy, form, or agreement it use s unless it contains the following provisions: a. ''These provisions are consistent with and do not supersede, conflict with, or otherwise alter the employee obligations, rights, or liabilities created by existing statute or Executive order relating to (1 ) classified information, (2) communications to Congress, (3) the reporting to an Inspector General of a violation of any law, rule, or regulation, or mismanagement, a gross waste of funds, an abuse of authority, or a substantial and specific danger to pub lic health or safety, or (4) any other whistleblower protection. The definitions, requirements, obligations, rights, sanctions, and liabilities created by controlling Executive orders and statutory provisions are incorporated into this agreement and are co ntrolling.'' b. The limitation above shall not contravene requirements applicable to Standard Form 312, Form 4414, or any other form issued by a Federal department or agency governing the nondisclosure of classified information. c. Notwithstanding provis ion listed in paragraph (a), a nondisclosure or confidentiality policy form or agreement that is to be executed by a person connected with the conduct of an intelligence or intelligence -related activity, other than an employee or officer of the United Stat es Government, may contain provisions appropriate to the particular activity for which such document is to be used. Such form or agreement shall, at a minimum, require that the person will not disclose any classified information received in the course of such activity unless specifically authorized to do so by the United States Government. Such nondisclosure or confidentiality forms shall also make it clear that they do not bar disclosures to Congress, or to an authorized official of an executive agency or the Department of Justice, that are essential to reporting a substantial violation of law. 11. Notice Regarding Eligible/Ineligible Activities Eligible activities under this program include those which describe and promote the understanding of scientific and technical aspects of specific energy technologies, but not those which encourage or support political activities such as the collection and dissemination of information related to potential, planned or pending legislation. 12. Prohibition on Lobbying Activity By accepting funds under this award, you agree that none of the funds obligated on the award shall be expended, directly or indirectly, to influence congressional action on any legislation or appropriation matters pending before Congress, other than to communicate to Members of Congress as described in 18 USC 1913. This restriction is in addition to those prescribed elsewhere in statute and regulation. 55 13. Proprietary Application Information Patentable ideas, trade secrets, proprietary or confidential commercial or financial information, disclosure of which may harm the applicant, should be included in an application only when such information is necessary to convey an understanding of the proposed project. The use and disclosure of such da ta may be restricted, provided the applicant includes the following legend on the first page of any document included in the application that contains such proprietary information and specifies the pages of the document which are to be restricted: \"The da ta contained in pages _____ of this document have been submitted in confidence and contain trade secrets or proprietary information, and such data shall be used or disclosed only for evaluation purposes, provided that if this applicant receives an award as a result of or in connection with the submission of this application, DOE shall have the right to use or disclose the data herein to the extent provided in the award. This restriction does not limit the government's right to use or disclose data obtained without restriction from any source, including the applicant.\" To protect such data, each line or paragraph on the pages containing such data must be specifically identified and marked with a legend similar to the following: \"The following contains propr ietary information that (name of applicant) requests not be released to persons outside the Government, except for purposes of review and evaluation.\" 14. Publications The recipient is expected to publish or otherwise make publicly available the results of the work conducted under any award resulting from this FOA. Publications and other methods of public communication describing any work based on or developed under an a ward resulting from this FOA must contain an acknowledgment of SC support.

Registration Requirements Additional administrative requirements for DOE grants and cooperative agreements are contained in 2 CFR 25 (See: www.eCFR.gov ). Prime awardees must keep their data in SAM current at www.SAM.gov . Sub recipient s at all tiers must obtain DUNS numbers and provide the DUNS to the prime awardee before the subaward can be issued. 16. Righ ts in Technical Data Normally, the government has unlimited rights in technical data created under a DOE agreement , including the right to distribute to the public . Delivery or third -party licensing of proprietary 56 software or data developed solely at private expense (\"Limited Rights Data\") will not normally be required except as specifically negotiated in a particular agreement to satisfy DOE's own needs or to ensure the commercialization o f technology developed under a DOE agreement. If software is specified for delivery to DOE, or if other special circumstances exist, e.g., DOE specifying \"open -source\" treatment of software, then the DOE C ontracting Officer, after negotiation with the re cipient, may include in the award special provisions requiring the recipient to obtain written approval of the DOE C ontracting Officer prior to asserting copyright in the software, modifying the retained Government license, and/or otherwise altering the co pyright provisions. 17. Subaward and Executive Reporting Additional administrative requirements necessary for DOE grants and cooperative agreements to comply with the Federal Funding and Transparency Act of 2006 (FFATA) are contained in 2 CFR 170.

Competitive segment Competitive segment means the initial project period recommended for support or each extension of a project period resulting from a renewal award. 59 Conference (domestic or international) Conference (domestic or international) means a symposium, seminar, workshop, or any other organized and formal meeting, whether conducted face-to-face or via the Internet, where individuals assemble (or meet virtually) to exchange information and views or explore or clarify a defined subject, problem, or area of knowledge, whether or not a published report results from such meeting. Consortium or sub-award agreement Consortium or sub-award agreement means a formalized agreement whereby a research project is carried out by the grantee and one or more other organizations that are separate legal entities. Under the agreement, the grantee must perform a substantive role in the conduct of the planned research and not merely serve as a conduit of funds to another party or parties. These agreements typically involve a specific level of effort from the consortium organization 's PD/PI and a categorical breakdown of costs, such as personnel, supplies, and other allowable expenses, including F&A costs. The relationship between the recipient and the collaborating organizations is considered a sub- award relationship. Consultant Consultant means an individual who provides professional advice or services for a fee, but not as an employee of the engaging party. To prevent apparent or actual conflicts of interest, grantees and consultants must establish written guidelines indicating the conditions of payment of consulting fees. Consultants also include firms that provide professional advice or services. See 2 CFR 200.459. Continuation application/award Continuation application/award means a financial assistance request (in the form of an application or progress report) or resulting award for a subsequent budget period within a previously approved project period for which a recipient does not have to compete with other applicants. Contract Contract means a legal instrument by which a non-Federal entity purchases property or services needed to carry out the project or program under a Federal award. The term as used in this part does not include a legal instrument, even if the non-Federal entity considers it a contract, when the substance of the transaction meets the definition of a Federal award or sub-award (see 2 CFR 200.1 Subaward). Contractor Contractor means an entity that receives a contract as defined in 2 CFR 200.1 Contract. Contract ing (or Grants Management) officer Contract ing (or Grants Management) officer means a DOE official responsible for the business management aspects of grants and cooperative agreements, including review, negotiation, award, and administration, and for the interpretation of grants administration policies and provisions. COs and GMOs are delegated the authority to obligate DOE to the expenditure of funds and permit changes to approved projects on behalf of DOE. Contract ing (or Grants Management) specialist Contract ing (or Grants Management) specialist means a DOE staff member who works with a contract or grants management officer and is assigned the day-to-day management of a portfolio of grants and/or cooperative agreements. These activities include, but are not limited to, evaluating grant applications for administrative content and compliance with statutes, regulations, and guidelines; negotiating grants; providing consultation and technical assistance to grantees; and administering grants after award. Cooperative agreement Cooperative agreement means a type of financial assistance used when there will be substantial Federal scientific or programmatic involvement. Substantial involvement means that, after award, scientific or program staff will assist, guide, coordinate, or participate in project activities. Cost principles Cost principles means the government -wide principles, 2 CFR 200 Subpart E (or, in the case of commercial organizations, the Federal Acquisition Regulation [48 CFR 31], or, in the case of hospitals, see Appendix IX to Part 200\u2014Hospital Cost Principles , Appendix E, \"Principles For Determining 60 Costs Applicable to Research and Development Under Grants and Contracts with Hospitals \"), on allowability and unallowability of costs under federally sponsored agreements. Cost sharing or matching Cost sharing or matching means the portion of project costs not paid by Federal funds (unless otherwise authorized by Federal statute). See also 2 CFR 200.306 Cost sharing or matching. Deadline Deadline means the published date and/or time that a grant application is to be submitted to the funding agency. Debarment and suspension Debarment and suspension means the actions taken by a debarring official in accordance with OMB guidance at 2 CFR 180, \"Non-procurement Debarment and Suspension, \" to exclude a person or organization from participating in grants and other non-procurement awards government -wide. If debarred or suspended, the person or organization may not receive financial assistance (under a grant, cooperative agreement, or sub-award, or contract under a grant) for a specified period of time. Debarments and suspensions carried out pursuant to 2 CFR 376 are distinct from post-award suspension action by an awarding agency. See 2 CFR 901 for DOE implementation. Direct costs Direct costs means costs that can be identified specifically with a particular sponsored project, an instructional activity, or any other institutional activity, or that can be directly assigned to such activities relatively easily with a high degree of accuracy. See 2 CFR 200.413. Disallowed costs Disallowed costs means those charges to a Federal award that the Federal awarding agency or pass-through entity determines to be unallowable, in accordance with the applicable Federal statutes, regulations, or the terms and conditions of the Federal award. Domestic organization Domestic organization means a public (including a State or other governmental agency) or private non-profit or for-profit organization that is located in the United States or its territories, is subject to U.S. laws, and assumes legal and financial accountability for awarded funds and for the performance of the grant -supported activities. DUNS number DUNS number means a nine-digit number established and assigned by Dun and Bradstreet to uniquely identify a business entity. Effort Effort means the amount of time, usually expressed as a percentage of the total, which a faculty member or other employee spends on a sponsored project. No one is allowed to spend more than 100% total commitment on all academic activities, including grant -sponsored research, university -sponsored research, teaching, administration, advising and other contracted duties. Effort is indicated on the budget in units of person -months. Equipment Equipment means tangible personal property (including information technology systems) having a useful life of more than one year and a per-unit acquisition cost which equals or exceeds the lesser of the capitalization level established by the non-Federal entity for financial statement purposes, or $5,000. See also 2 CFR 200.1 Capital assets, Computing devices, General purpose equipment, Information technology systems, Special purpose equipment, and Supplies. Expanded authorities Expanded authorities means authorization to grantees under certain research grant mechanisms which waives the requirement for prior agency approval for specified actions related to awards. Example: 90-day pre-award spending authority, no cost extensions for up to one additional year, and automatic carryover of unobligated funds from one budget period to the next. The expanded authorities are now contained in the standard terms and conditions for most research grants. Expiration date Expiration date means generally, the date signifying the end of the current project period, after which the grantee is not authorized to obligate grant funds. 61 Facilities and administrative costs Facilities and administrative costs means costs that are incurred by a grantee for common or joint objectives and that, therefore, cannot be identified specifically with a particular project or program. These costs also are known as indirect costs. Federal financial report Federal financial report means submitted on Standard Form (SF) 425, to indicate the status of awarded funds for the period covered. Frequency of reporting is specified in the Reporting Checklist provided as part of the award documents. Financial assistance Financial assistance means transfer by DOE of money or property to an eligible entity to support or stimulate a public purpose authorized by statute. Financial status report Financial status report means see Federal Financial Report. Foreign travel Foreign travel is meant to include travel outside of North America (Canada, Mexico, and the United States ) and U.S. territories and possessions (Guam, American Samoa, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands . A trip is considered foreign travel for all legs of the itinerary if the traveler does not return to his or her post prior to departure for a foreign destination. Costs for foreign travel may be restricted by the language of a Funding Opportunity Announcement. Funding opportunity announcement (FOA) Funding opportunity announcement (FOA) means A publicly available document by which a Federal Agency makes known its intentions to award discretionary grants or cooperative agreements, usually as a result of competition for funds. Funding opportunity announcements may be known as program announcements, requests for applications, notices of funding availability, solicitations, or other names depending on the Agency and type of program. Funding opportunity announcements can be found at www.Grants.gov . An FOA may also be known as a solicitation. Grant agreement Grant agreement means a legal instrument of financial assistance between a Federal awarding agency or pass-through entity and a non-Federal entity that, consistent with 31 USC 6302, 6304: (a) Is used to enter into a relationship the principal purpose of which is to transfer anything of value from the Federal awarding agency or pass-through entity to the non-Federal entity to carry out a public purpose authorized by a law of the United States (see 31 USC 6101(3)); and not to acquire property or services for the Federal awarding agency or pass-through entity 's direct benefit or use; (b) Is distinguished from a cooperative agreement in that it does not provide for substantial involvement between the Federal awarding agency or pass-through entity and the non-Federal entity in carrying out the activity contemplated by the Federal award. (c) Does not include an agreement that provides only: (1) Direct United States Government cash assistance to an individual; (2) A subsidy; (3) A loan; (4) A loan guarantee; or (5) Insurance. Grant -supported project or activity Grant -supported project or activity means those activities specified or described in a grant application or in a subsequent submission that are approved by DOE for funding, regardless of whether Federal funding constitutes all or only a portion of the financial support necessary to carry them out. Grantee Grantee means the organization or individual awarded a grant or cooperative agreement by DOE that is responsible and accountable for the use of the funds provided and for the performance of the grant -supported project or activity. The grantee is the entire legal entity even if a particular component is designated in award documents. The grantee is legally responsible and accountable to DOE for the performance and financial aspects of the grant -62 supported project or activity. Also known as awardee or recipient. Grants.gov Grants.gov (https:// www. Grants.gov /) has been designated by the Office of Management and Budget as the single access point for all grant programs offered by 26 Federal grant -making agencies. It provides a single interface for agencies to announce their grant opportunities and for all applicants to find and apply for those opportunities. Indirect costs (facilities & administrative) Indirect (F&A) costs means those costs incurred for a common or joint purpose benefitting more than one cost objective, and not readily assignable to the cost objectives specifically benefitted, without effort disproportionate to the results achieved. To facilitate equitable distribution of indirect expenses to the cost objectives served, it may be necessary to establish a number of pools of indirect (F&A) costs. Indirect (F&A) cost pools must be distributed to benefitted cost objectives on bases that will produce an equitable result in consideration of relative benefits derived. Institutional base salary Institutional base salary means the annual compensation paid by an organization for an employee 's appointment, whether that individual 's time is spent on research, teaching, patient care, or other activities. Base salary excludes any income that an individual may be permitted to earn outside of duties for the applicant/grantee organization. Base salary may not be increased as a result of replacing organizational salary funds with grant funds. Matching or cost sharing Matching or cost sharing means the value of third -party in-kind contributions and the portion of the costs of a federally assisted project or program not borne by the Federal government. Matching or cost sharing may be required by statute or program regulation. Costs used to satisfy matching or cost-sharing requirements are subject to the same policies governing allowability as other costs under the approved budget. Merit (or peer) review Merit (or peer) review means the process that involves the consistent application of standards and procedures that produce fair, equitable, and objective examinations of applications based on an evaluation of scientific or technical merit or other relevant aspects of the application. The review is performed by experts (reviewers) in the field of endeavor for which support is requested. Merit review is intended to provide guidance and to the DOE individuals responsible for making award decisions. Monitoring Monitoring means a process whereby the programmatic and business management performance aspects of a grant are assessed by reviewing information gathered from various required reports, audits, site visits, and other sources. NEPA NEPA means the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), Public Law 91 - 190, as amended . NEPA requires Federal agencies to assess the environmental effects of proposed major Federal actions prior to making decisions. No-cost extension No-cost extension means an extension of time to a project period and/or budget period to complete the work of the grant under that period, without additional Federal funds or competition. Non-Federal share Non-Federal share means when cost sharing or matching is required as a condition of an award, the portion of allowable project/program costs not borne by the Federal government. Obligations Obligations when used in connection with a non-Federal entity 's utilization of funds under a Federal award, obligations means orders placed for property and services, contracts and sub-awards made, and similar transactions during a given period that require payment by the non-Federal entity during the same or a future period. OMB circulars OMB circulars means government -wide guidance issued to Heads of Federal agencies by the Director of the Office of Management and Budget . Other significant contributors Other significant contributors means individuals who have committed to contribute to the scientific development or execution of the project, but are not 63 committing any specified measurable effort (i.e., person months) to the project. These individuals are typically presented at \"effort of zero person months \" or \"as needed. \" Individuals with measurable effort may not be listed as Other Significant Contributors (OSCs). Consultants should be included if they meet this definition. Program participant Program participants are the recipients of service or training provided at a workshop, conference, seminar, symposium or other short -term instructional or information -sharing activity funded by an external grant or award, or the training beneficiaries of the project or program funded by an external grant or award. A participant is not involved in providing any deliverable to the grantee or a third -party or would not be terminated or replaced for failure to perform. Participant support costs Participant support costs means direct costs for items such as stipends or subsistence allowances, travel allowances, and registration fees paid to or on behalf of participants or trainees (but not employees) in connection with conferences, or training projects. Person months Person months is the metric for expressing the effort (amount of time) PD/PI(s), faculty and other senior/key personnel devote to a specific project. The effort is based on the type of appointment of the individual with the organization; e.g., calendar year, academic year, and/or summer term; and the organization 's definition of such. For instance, some institutions define the academic year as a 9-month appointment while others define it as a 10-month appointment. Pre-application or pre- proposal Pre-application or pre-proposal means a brief outline or narrative of proposed work and sometimes budget, for informal review by a sponsor to determine whether an application should be submitted. Three predominant reasons for requiring submission of a preliminary pre-application are: Reduce the applicant 's unnecessary effort in proposal preparation when the chance of success is very small. This is particularly true of exploratory initiatives where the community senses that a major new direction is being identified, or competitions that will result in a small number of actual awards. Increase the overall quality of the submission. Distill the number of applications that will be submitted to the agency and the number of anticipated reviewers needed to review. Pre-award costs Pre-award costs means any cost incurred prior to the beginning date of the project period or the initial budget period of a competitive segment (under a multi -year award), in anticipation of the award and at the applicant 's own risk, for otherwise allowable costs. Prior approval Prior approval means written approval from the designated contracting officer . Program Director/ Principal Investigator Program Director/ Principal Investigator means the individual(s) designated by the applicant organization to have the appropriate level of authority and responsibility to direct the project or program to be supported by the award. The applicant organization may designate multiple individuals as program directors/principal investigators (PD/PIs) who share the authority and responsibility for leading and directing the project, intellectually and logistically. When multiple PD/PIs are named, each is responsible and accountable to the applicant organization, or as appropriate, to a collaborating organization for the proper conduct of the project or program including the submission of all required reports. The presence of more than one PD/PI on an application or award diminishes neither the responsibility nor the accountability of any individual PD/PI. Program income Program income means gross income earned by the non-Federal entity that is directly generated by a supported activity or earned as a result of the Federal award during the period of performance except as provided in 2 CFR 200.307 64 paragraph (f). (See 2 CFR 200.1 Period of performance.) Program income includes but is not limited to income from fees for services performed, the use or rental or real or personal property acquired under Federal awards, the sale of commodities or items fabricated under a Federal award, license fees and royalties on patents and copyrights, and principal and interest on loans made with Federal award funds. Interest earned on advances of Federal funds is not program income. Except as otherwise provided in Federal statutes, regulations, or the terms and conditions of the Federal award, program income does not include rebates, credits, discounts, and interest earned on any of them. See also 2 CFR 200.407 Prior written approval (prior approval). See also 35 USC 200- 212 \"Disposition of Rights in Educational Awards \" for inventions made under Federal awards. Program Manager Program Manager means the DOE official responsible for the programmatic, scientific, and/or technical aspects of a grant. The same role is filled by Program Directors, Program Officers, or Project Directors at other Federal agencies. Progress report Progress report means periodic, frequently annual, report submitted by the grantee and used by DOE to assess progress and to determine whether to provide funding for the budget period subsequent to that covered by the report. Project/performance site Project/ performance site means location(s) of where the work described in the research plan will be conducted. Project period Project period means the total time for which Federal support of a project has been programmatically approved as shown in the award documents; however, it does not constitute a commitment by the Federal government to fund the entire period. The total award period comprises the initial competitive segment, any subsequent competitive segments resulting from a renewal award(s), and extensions . Proposal See application. Re-budgeting Re-budgeting means reallocation of funds available for spending between approved budget categories to allow best use of funds to accomplish the project goals. Recipient Recipient means the organizational entity or individual receiving a grant or cooperative agreement. Renewal application Renewal application means an application requesting additional funding for a period subsequent to that provided by a current award. Renewal applications compete for funds with all other peer reviewed applications and must be developed as fully as though the applicant is applying for the first time. Research Research is defined as a systematic study directed toward fuller scientific knowledge or understanding of the subject studied. See 2 CFR 200.1 Research and Development (R&D). Research misconduct Research misconduct means fabrication, falsification, or plagiarism in proposing, performing, or reviewing research, or in reporting research results, but does not include honest error or diffe rences of opinion. See 10 CFR 733 . SAM.gov SAM.gov is the System for Award Management (SAM) a consolidated service that in cludes Entity Registration, Assistance Listings, and other services for making, managing, and receiving Federal awards. Scope of work Scope of work means the aims, objectives, and purposes of a grant; as well as the methodology, approach, analyses or other activities; and the tools, technologies, and timeframes needed to meet the grant 's objectives. This includes the research or training plan included with the original grant application, along with any approved modifications. Senior/Key Personnel Senior/Key personnel means the PD/PI and other individuals who contribute to the scientific development or execution of a project in a substantive, measurable way, whether or not they receive salaries or compensation under the grant. Typically, these individuals have doctoral or other professional 65 degrees, although individuals at the masters or baccalaureate level may be considered senior/key personnel if their involvement meets this definition. Consultants and those with a postdoctoral role also may be considered senior/key personnel if they meet this definition. \"Zero percent \" effort or \"as needed \" is not an acceptable level of involvement for Senior/Key Personnel. Significant re-budgeting Significant re-budgeting means a threshold that is reached when expenditures in a single direct cost budget category deviate (increase or decrease) from the categorical commitment level established for the budget period by more than 25 percent of the total costs awarded. Significant re-budgeting is one indicator of change in scope. Small business concern Small business concern means a business that meets the regulatory and size requirements established by the SBA at 13 CFR part 121. Solicitation See Funding Opportunity Announcement . Subaward Subaward means a legal instrument by which a recipient provides funds (or property in lieu of funds) to an eligible subrecipient (or a lower -tier transaction) to perform a substantive portion of the grant -supported program or project. The term includes such financial assistance when provided by any legal agreement (even if the agreement is called a contract) but does not include any form of assistance which is excluded from the definition of a grant, including the recipient 's procurement of property or services needed to carry out the project or program. The term includes consortium agreements. Subrecipient Subrecipient means a non-Federal entity that receives a subaward from a pass- through entity to carry out part of a Federal program; but does not include an individual that is a beneficiary of such program. A sub-recipient may also be a recipient of other Federal awards directly from a Federal awarding agency. Supplement Supplement means a request for an increase in support during a current budget period for expansion of the project 's scope or to meet increased costs unforeseen at the time of the new or renewal application. A supplement may increase support for future years in addition to the current year. Supplements require applications and are subject to administrative and merit review. Terms and conditions of award Terms and conditions of award means all legal requirements imposed on a grant by DOE, whether based on statute, regulation, policy, or other document referenced in the grant award, or specified by the grant award document itself. The award documents may include both standard and special conditions that are considered necessary to attain the grant 's objectives, facilitate post-award administration of the grant, conserve grant funds, or otherwise protect the Federal government 's interests. Unallowable costs Unallowable costs means costs that cannot be charged, directly or indirectly, to Federal awards because the costs are prohibited by law, regulation (including applicable cost principles), or the terms and conditions of award. Costs that are not allowable, allocable, or reasonable are u nallowable . Unliquidated obligation Unliquidated obligations means, for financial reports prepared on a cash basis, obligations incurred by the non-Federal entity that have not been paid (liquidated). For reports prepared on an accrual expenditure basis, these are obligations incurred by the non-Federal entity for which an expenditure has not been recorded. Unobligated balance Unobligated balance means the amount of funds under a Federal award that the non-Federal entity has not obligated. The amount is computed by subtracting the cumulative amount of the non-Federal entity 's unliquidated obligations and expenditures of funds under the Federal award from the cumulative amount of the funds that the Federal awarding agency or pass- through entity authorized the non-Federal entity to obligate. 66 Validate In the context of the data management plan requirements, validate means to support, corroborate, verify, or otherwise determine the legitimacy of the research findings. Validation of research findings could be accomplished by reproducing the original experiment or analyses, comparing and contrasting the results against those of a new experiment or analyses, or by some other means.
