Massage may be applied to the entire body or to a specific area of discomfort. Stress, both physical and emotional, can upset the delicate balance of our body's functions and massage can help normalize them. Massage therapy can have a profound effect on your physical, mental and emotional states. Our Therapists are licensed with the State of WI, and they have extensive experience in both therapeutic and relaxation massage. Massage therapy can do so much. Through the gentle kneading of the soft tissue of the body (skin, muscles, ligaments and tendons), it induces a physical and emotional therapeutic response. Stress and anxiety can also be managed with massage therapy. Massage relieves pain, relaxes stiff muscles and soothes knotted muscles by increasing the blood supply to the affected area and warming it, resulting in the muscle becoming relaxed. Massage can break up scar tissue and loosen stiff joints, and assist in circulation. It can also help reduce inflammation, relieve pain and calm the body and mind. Massage therapy has been utilized by corporations for health fairs, wellness events, and as rewards to employees for a job well done. For therapeutic or for total body relaxation massages, a Massage Gift Certificate is the perfect gift for: - Birthdays - Anniversaries - Work appreciation - Special Occasions - Holidays Massage Therapy sessions are priced as follows: - 30 minutes is $40.00 - 45 minutes is $45.00 - 60 minutes is $60.00 - 90 minutes is $100.00 Call 262-681-8829 to schedule an appointment. ** You can check with our Patient coordinator at the front desk for more information on Holiday Specials "}
