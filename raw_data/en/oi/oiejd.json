NO. 1 for the following reasons The intended and / or unintended consequences on society are very clear and all point to a break down of our civil society; invading the family and home. Attached are 2 papers talking about the CONSEQUENCES of same sex \"marriage.\" These are facts, not opinions. No one is really addressing the foundation of this bill, and as such, we, as Americans, are being disingenuous. Although uncomfortable and emotional, we must include a dialog of morality on this issue. Some would have us think that our society has progressed to the point where we must embrace homosexuality in this societal progressive evolution, but homosexuality is not new. It has been around for a long time; dating back 3000 BC, to Moses day and the Bible ; which really brings us to two questions: 1. Who has authority to define \"morality?\" The Bible or the State? The Bible clearly states that homosexual behavior is immoral. Just as pornography, murder, rape, theft, etc. of which our civil government, through our laws, prescribes. Our nation's virtue and morality were founded in the Judeo Christian ethic; based on the words, the truths and the principles of the Christian Bible. This is not debatable. There are volumes of documentation supporting our nation's acknowledgement and reliance on God ; which leads to the second question 2. Is this still \"One Nation Under God\"? Does God still have a place in the \"American experiment?\" President Gerald Ford said: \"Without God there could be no American form of government, nor an American way of life. Recognition of the Supreme Being is the first - the most basic- expression of Americanism. Thus the found fathers of America saw it, and thus with God's help, it will continue to be.\" Making any immoral lifestyle A LAW brings death to a civil society. The ONLY way any immorality celebrated could remotely be accepted is if we, as a nation, remove God and the Judeo Christian ethic out of civil government. Because this is the problem... God and the Bible. By voting to legalize same sex \"marriage\", aren't our \"representatives\" really voting to do just this... remove God and the Judeo Christian ethic out of our civil government? This testimony is respectfully submitted by Kathleen Campbell 1794 Halama St. Kihei, HI 96753 October 26, 2013 Dear Leaders of our State, I humbly thank you for the opportunity to share my heart and thoughts regarding this very difficult issue. First I would like to confess that I , like every human being born am broken, and in desperate need of grace. My view is not an attack or bias against any person but a desire to speak the truth in love with a standard that is beyond myself but that which gives us a reference point in which we live and truly love one another. Francis Schaeffer once said, \"For any finite particulars to have any meaning in life, it has to have an infinite reference point.\" For us as humans to have any meaning, purpose or any responsible moral code to live by, we need an infinite reference point. If we all had our own reference point then on one can condemn or approve any law or moral behavior as right or wrong. Who is to say that Adolph Hitler did any wrong unless we have a standard that says, \"Thou shall not kil l.\" Mr. Hitler thought he was doing the world a favor through his ethnic cleansing but it went against a higher moral law that brings a reference point of what was right and wrong. I humbly submit that God himself and His word is and has been the reference point for us and our country since the birth of our nation . Our forefathers had the Bible as our reference point, moral compass , laws, rules of conduct and absolutes that allowed our society to have a foundation of thought and conduct to live by. We can however choose to submit to His ways and principles or change and make our own rules to live by , but we must understand that although we have the f reedom to make those choices, we do not have the freedom from the consequences of our choices. It is with this heavy heart that I share my deep, deep concern for the direction that our country, our state and even our families are moving , from once being a people who stood upon God's word as our guide to having our own reasoning and relative moral compass to b e a guide for ourselves. If we look at the history of the human race, we can conclude that when society turns away from God's divine purposes and ways, it ends up being corrupt and self -destructive. About 2000 yea rs ago, the apostle Paul wrote a letter to the Roman church. It is almost scary how his words penned at that time resonate so true for us today. I humbly ask that you take some time to connect with this passage and ask what responsibility as leaders who w ill help shape our future should respond to the decision that will soon be addressed and made. Romans 1:18 -32 18 For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who by their unrighteousness suppress the truth. 19 For what can be known about God is pl ain to them, because God has shown it to them. 20 For his invisible attributes, namely, his eternal power and divine nature, have been clearly perceived, ever since the creation of the world, in the things that have been made. So they are without excuse. 21 For although they knew God, they did not honor him as God or give thanks to him, but they became futile in their thinking, and their foolish hearts were darkened. 22 Claiming to be wise, they became fools, 23 and exchanged the glory of the immortal God f or images resembling mortal man and birds and animals and creeping things. 24 Therefore God gave them up in the lusts of their hearts to impurity, to the dishonoring of their bodies among themselves, 25 because they exchanged the truth about God for a lie and worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed forever! Amen. 26 For this reason God gave them up to dishonorable passions. For their women exchanged natural relations for those that are contrary to nature; 27 and the men lik ewise gave up natural relations with women and were consumed with passion for one another, men committing shameless acts with men and receiving in themselves the due penalty for their error. 28 And since they did not see fit to acknowledge God, God gave th em up to a debased mind to do what ought not to be done. 29 They were filled with all manner of unrighteousness, evil, covetousness, malice. They are full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, maliciousness. They are gossips, 30 slanderers, haters of God, insol ent, haughty, boastful, inventors of evil, disobedient to parents, 31 foolish, faithless, heartless, ruthless. 32 Though they know God's righteous decree that those who practice such things deserve to die, they not only do them but give approval to those w ho practice them. When Jesus walked this earth, his life demonstrated what true love really meant. He loved sinners and reached out to the world around him. When confronted with the Pharisees who wanted to stone a woman caught in adultery he told her accus ers, \"He who is without sin cast the first stone.\" One by one they all left. Alone with the woman he spoke love and truth to her. He said, \"neither do I condemn you, go and sin no more.\" Jesus loved the sinner but hated her sin. He knew that it was sin tha t would destroy us. Homosexuals are loved by God, but like any behavior that does not conform to God's standard; God cannot condone that behavior. A lthough a murderer, liar, fornicator, or thief are all loved by Go d, their behavior is not acceptable. That we must love despite ones sexual orientation is no doubt. However there are deeper and greater issues that compel me to say that allowing same sex marriage will be a step away from God's Heart and Purpose for marriage and family and thus we will reap the consequences that will continue the turning away from His perfect and good plan for our lives. I am saddened to say this but I too must share my heart . Thank you for taking the time to hear my heart!

I believe this special session violates our democratic process. This is a highly controversial bill. The voice of the people has been excluded from this process. This bill will alter our island lifestyle and culture. We are all products our Kapuna and our parents. Our earliest concepts of male and female characteristics come from our ancestors. This bill will change our definition of family. Please vote no and let this issue be decided by a larger body of decision makers.

This bill has huge ramifications to families, children, education and religious freedoms. this is too important to allow the legislative body (which I feel is heavily biased and politicized to be meaningfully representative of their constituent's beliefs) to be the determining voice for this issue. I support the option of having Hawaii's people vote on the issue . . . it's the right thing to do. I respectfully request the issue be given the time and voice it needs so that we can do the right thing for the majority of our people and not for the purpose of satisfying a minority position.

Sumulong Individual Oppose No Comments: This is the most important reason. Whenever one violates the natural moral order established by God, one sins and offends God. Same-sex \"marriage\" does just this. Accordingly, anyone who professes to love God must be opposed to it. Marriage is not the creature of any State. Rather, it was established by God in Paradise for our first parents, Adam and Eve. As we read in the Book of Genesis: \"God created man in His image; in the Divine image he created him; male and female He created them. God blessed them, saying: 'Be fertile and multiply; fill the earth and subdue it.'\" (Gen. 1:28-29) The same was taught by Our Savior Jesus Christ: \"From the beginning of the creation, God made them male and female. For this cause a man shall leave his father and mother; and shall cleave to his wife.\" (Mark 10:6-7). Genesis also teaches how God punished Sodom and Gomorrah for the sin of homosexuality: \"The Lord rained down sulphurous fire upon Sodom and Gomorrah. He overthrew those cities and the whole Plain, together with the inhabitants of the cities and the produce of the soil.\" (Gen. 19:24-25) Please note that testimony submitted less than 24 hours prior to the hearing , improperly identified, or directed to the incorrect office, may not be posted online or distributed to the committee prior to the convening of the public hearing.

Shimabukuro, Vice ChairOctober 28, 201310:30 AM Hearing Dear Members of the Committee on Judiciary and Labor,My name is Susan Duffy. I have been married for a little over 30 years and my husband and I have two teenage daughters. I am writing to urge you to oppose any bill that would legalize same sex marriage and to reject any legislation that would seek to to undermine the institution of marriage as we know it. Marriage equality cannot be achieved by making same sex couples the equivalent of opposite sex couples. The essential public purpose of marriage is to attach mothers and fathers to their children and to one another. Marriage is adult society's institutional structure for protecting the legitimate interests of children who also have rights in our society. Children deserve to have a mother and a father. I am sure you have heard from many professional organizations that claim that same sex couples make fine parents but I would caution against such optimistic claims particularly since we know that some of these studies have been called out for used flawed methodologies.Furthermore, we have not even begun to explore all of the unintended consequences that are cropping up all over where same sex marriage has been legalized. We already have civil unions in Hawaii and our understanding was that this was enough. We had to have civil unions so that same sex partners could have their benefits. If need be, go in and change the civil union's law so that they can get their federal benefits. There is no reason to take such a dramatic step in record time to fundamentally change the institution of marriage via a special session.If you vote yes to any bill which undermines marriage, you will harm your constituents in ways that you can't even begin to imagine and all for the sake of giving the title of \"married\" to same sex couples who head less than 1% of Hawaii's households. If you are so certain that the people want to have same sex marriage legalized here in the islands, then by all means, put it to a vote of the people, but do not use a special session to slip this through thinking we won't notice.Please, for the sake of the future children of the state of Hawaii, resist the pressure you are facing. Please vote no on any measure that seeks to legalize same sex marriage.From: Oct 28, 2013 10:30AM (Written Only) Date: Saturday, October 26, 2013 8:34:18 PM SB1 Submitted on: 10/26/2013 Testimony for on Oct 28, 2013 10:30AM in Conference Room Auditorium Submitted By Organization Testifier PositionTestifying in Person Minnie Pang Individual Oppose No Comments: Same-sex marriage should not be passed in a special session. Traditional marriage is best in raising children by their biological father & mother. Marriage was established to join a man & a woman on Holy matrimony and shall remain as that. The U.S. dollar bill stated - IN GOD WE TRUST, we need to respect what GOD taught us to preserve this Country.

Re: In Opposition to S.B. 1: The Hawaii Marriage Equality Act of 2013 Dear Senate Committee on Judiciary and Labor, I am opposed to S.8.1, the Hawaii Marriage Equality Act of 2013, because it is in utter opposition to the will of Hawaii voters who voted in 1998 to define marriage exclusively between a man and a woman in the Hawaii constitution. More than 250,000 Hawaii voters expressed their resolute position on the definition of marriage as exclusively between a man and a woman. In addition, the Senate bill does not provide protections for the rights of parents to remove their children from public school classes that support or promote same-sex marriage or minimize the importance of marriage between a man and a woman. It re\u00ad defines the most core institution of society, marriage. The Senate bill does not properly protect religious institutions. Many churches have nonprofit organizations to help them carry out their religious missions, such as religious schools and colleges. The Senate bill covers only \"religious organizations.\" Unlike protections in other states, it does not protect these other important institutions that are vital to churches . Many churches charge fees for the use of their chapels for weddings so they can use the additional money to support important religious activities, such as their youth ministry or program to feed the hungry. The Senate bill excludes protections for churches that do so. I urge you to vote NO on S.B. 1. Thank you for your time and leadership. Sincerely, ~/~ .~ Lynette K.

One of the reasons that our forefathers left the mother country was due to religious persecution . It redefines the most core institution of society which is marriage. Marriage between a man and a woman is for the founding and establishing of families. It fails to protects churches, religious groups and temples from lawsuits. It will also fail to protect Bishop's, Priest's and other Clergy members from lawsuits. It provides no protection for the right of religious parents to remove their children from public school classes that support or promote same-sex marriage or minimize the importance of marriage between a man and a woman. It is in opposition to the will of Hawaii voters who voted in 1998 to define marriage exclusively between a man and women in the Hawaii constitution. The people of Hawaii need to vote on this matter. I urge you to vote NO on S.S. 1. Thank you for your time and leadership. Sincerely , j r~ ~ J l/. //JAAAp Jonathan From: Dave Beadle To: JDLTestimony-WrittenOnly Subject: Special Session concerning same sex marriage Date: Saturday, October 26, 2013 10:09:58 PM Attachments: consequencesofweakreligiousfreedomprotectioninsamese.zip First let me state that I am against same sex marriage. Marriage is not about love, it is not about sex, or a contract, it is not a right. Marriage is about the family. It involves children. The family predates all other institutions, ie government, banking, education, religion...hence government, which derives its power from the people, can not redefine an institution that is older than itself short of being tyrannical. The family is a natural by product of a man and a woman creating a family together...and governments getting involved in the past is because society across the globe recognizes that a healthy stable family as that creates stability for the whole society, and therefore has created means to protect and promote the traditional family. Kids need both a Father and a Mother. Yes they can survive with a single parent or same sex parents...but it is in their best interests and the communities best interest to have children raised by a father and a mother. Now if two or more adults want to live together and do whatever they please to each other...that is not what makes a family...but I could really care less, more power to them. However, when they declare that I must accept their lifestyle as wholesome and good, I am sorry that violates my religious understandings of right and wrong. I strongly believe that the family comes from God himself, and follows natural law ( that is we should see the family appear naturally...and we do in the traditional sense...two females can't have kids nor can two males without artificially making it happen. It greatly bothers me that businesses have been forced to bake cakes, be their photographer, host their wedding, under the banner that it is their civil right. Well there are two rights these tyrannical laws violate, the right to freely associate and do business with whom I wish to do business with...it doesn't matter if someone else thinks I am wrong...we have a natural right to associate and do business in a free society. The other right it violates is my religious freedom. If you must pass a gay marriage law, then there must be language in place to protect these rights...religious freedom and the freedom to freely associate with whom I wish to associate with. In other words I should not be forced in any way, as an individual, perform any action I do not want to do. There is no harm to them in denying my services because they can go somewhere else. Attached are two pdf documents that I am including as part of my argument.From: mailinglist@capitol.hawaii.gov To: JDLWebTestimony Cc: rmakaiwi@hawaii.edu Oct 28, 2013 10:30AM (Written Only) Date: Saturday, October 26, 2013 10:28:17 PM SB1 Submitted on: 10/26/2013 Testimony for on Oct 28, 2013 10:30AM in Conference Room Auditorium Submitted By Organization Testifier PositionTestifying in Person Rachel Makaiwi Individual Oppose No Comments: I am opposed to the bill as it is written. According to SB 1, \"Religious organizations and facilities; liability exemption under certain circumstances. Notwithstanding any other law to the contrary, no religious organization shall be subject to any fine, penalty, injunction, administrative proceeding, or civil liability for refusing to make its facilities or grounds available for solemnization of any marriage celebration under this chapter; provided that the religious organization does not make its facilities or grounds available to the general public for solemnization of any marriage celebration for a Profit.\" Although attempting to protect the religious freedoms of organizations throughout Hawaii, this bill fails to protect the rights of religious organizations. As written, the rights of religious groups are only protected \"provided that the religious organization does not make its facilities or grounds available to the general public for solemnization of any marriage celebration for a Profit.\" Speaking from my own experiences, my church facilities have always been open to people of all backgrounds. Sharing what we have to all in a nonjudgmental attitude has allowed us to continue to treat others with equality and fairness. However, this bill is threatening our ability to share our facilities with everyone regardless of their religious affiliation or sexual orientations. I urge you to change the wording of this bill to truly protect the rights of religious organizations and all citizens throughout Hawaii. Thank you for your time.

For assistance please email webmaster@capitol.hawaii.gov October 25, 2013 The Honorable Donna Mercado Kim, Senate President Twenty -Seventh State Legislature State Capitol, Room 409 Honolulu, HI 96813 and Members of the Senate RE: In o pposition to passing SB1 as currently written Dear Senate President Kim and Members of the Senate, After consideration of all sides, and a very contentious debate, I strongly am in opposition to the passing of SB1 as currently written. Most parties seem to discuss and argue this issue based on emotion on both sides; I invite you to look at it from fact and not emotion. Three concerns of mine in the bill are : 1) the overt remova l of verbiage restricting the First Amendment rights and considerations of the US Constitution, 2) the inaccuracy that this is a civil rights issue, and 3) the surprising refusal to protect the citizen s and the previous votes therefrom. 1. Alteration of the S B1 Section 1, paragraphs 3(a), and (b); This section reads as follows and no longer acknowledges that clergy have a constitutional right to uphold millennia of religious teachings by refusing to participate in gay marriage ceremonies. Furthermore, it removes a broad general provision of (in the private sector) who can solemnize to a narrow restriction, removing the inherent First Amendment rights of ALL citizens . This restricts the C onstitution as well. Where previous verbiage includes a broader inclus ion of persons Refusal to solemnize a marriage. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to require any person authorized to perform solemnizations pursuant to this chapter to solemnize any marriage in violation of the person's rights as guaranteed by the Constitution of this State and the United States Constitution. No authorized person who fails or refuses to solemnize any marriage under this section shall be subject to any fine, penalty, injunction, administrative proceeding, or civil liability for the failure or refusal. (08/22/2013) compared to now The Honorable Donna Mercado Kim, Senate President Twenty -Seventh State Legislature October 25. 2013 Page 2 of 3 Refusal to solemnize a marriage. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to require any minister, priest, officer of any religious denomination or society, or religious society not having clergy but providing solemnizations that is authorized to perform solemnizations pursuant to this chapter to solemnize any marriage, and no such minister, priest, officer of any religious denomination or society, or religious society not having clergy that fails or refuses for any reason to solemnize any marriage under this section shall be subject to any fine, penalty, or other civil action for the failure or refusal. (10/19/2013) The state can allow same -sex marriage, but cannot force a private citizen to solemnize, or tolerate the union. This is a clear violation of the First Amendment. Even the state of California recognizes marriage dually, both as 1) civil, and 2) religious. The latter the state cannot regulate. And it is a person's individual right t o operate a private business as they see fit. We see this daily in Hawaii in the tourist industry. Many business es clearly cater and have inherent discrimination based on a person's race or geographic origination; we tolerate this. If a private busine ss chooses not to cater to any person that does not adhere to the values (real or perceived) of the company's business plan and motto, they have the right. Conversely, if a private company wishes to cater specifically to a special niche market, they can do so. Both have equal opportunity to fail or succeed, this should not be coerced by legislation . This is determined by the private market and businesses, and the acceptance or refusal of them . In the public sector, legislation to assure complete diversi ty should be the norm, however. 2. The inaccuracy that this is a civil rights issue. One of the most respected civil rights leaders, Dr. Martin Luther King defined this the best. In an excerpt from his letters in the Birmingham jail, he defined a civil right as the right (including civil disobedience) to correct and right the wrongs of un just laws . Specifically, an unjust law is a code inflicted upon a minority which that minority had no part in enacting or creating because it did not have the unhampered right to vote. In the case of SB1, we are not correcting any unjust law to two pers ons who wish to share their life. Under the current civil -unions bill in this State, they have all the rights. Furthermore, and legally under any contracts created between them there is no discrimination. When we think of those who are harmed, most pers ons do not feel homosexuals are discriminated against in 2013 in the United States. Studies and facts are evident looking at the lifestyles of most homosexuals, that in the United States, they have a high proportion of higher education, more disposable income and investments, and travel proportionately higher than heterosexual couples. There is no civil right issue here. Take a look at homosexuals in many African, Asian, and Middle Eastern countries and the inhumanities they struggle with; after which, y ou can understand the argument of a civil right is misunderstood and dilutes true and real issues that are unjust. The Honorable Donna Mercado Kim, Senate President Twenty -Seventh State Legislature October 25. 2013 Page 3 of 3 The fact is that there is no law on the books written that overtly discriminates or restricts a person for being a homosexual. There ar e no rights in the Constitution to marriage. This is equal for all persons, regardless of sexual orientation. If society wants this, there are procedures to change the Constitution and add this right. 3. Blatant dismissal of the Hawaii Voters We have had this issue in discussion for years, and it is time to move on. The issue was put forth to the voters, and the voters decided as a society what the definition of marriage is. Given our unique and very open and tolerant society, the legislative body put forth the civil- unions bill, which was past and has not had much opposition. It was fair, and put us in the column of tolerant states. Fast forward, and allow high- profile attorneys from the mainland [names withheld for libel, but we know who they are] must stir up our unique and loving society. With the stroke of the pen, SB1 has blatantly removed HRS \u00a7572C (2), which was written as a direct result of the voters of the State of Hawaii, and provided a compromise of most parties. Now, the voters feel vi olated. This issue should be brought forth to voters with the terms as you are attempting to pass in SB1, with directness, transparency, and proper debate. The State of Hawaii has a unique and strong tradition of family and unity. The changing of the law today as written, actually creates more angst, contention and intolerance from all sides. Today you are considering not just a bill or law that addresses temporal concerns of the community, but a law that transforms the fundamental basis of the famil y and the continued slippery slope of the loss of Constitutional Rights, notwithstanding the trust of the Legislative branch. Regardless of your decision, remember, this is a vote that will be inscribed in history , one not from the people . Make sure you are on the ethical side of history \u2014not just the popular.

Krez Travel Professional October 24, 2013 Honorable Senator Clayton Hee, Chairman, and Members of the Senate Committee on Judiciary and Labor Hawaii State Capitol 415 Beretania Street Honolulu, Hawaii 96813 Hearing Date: October 28, 2013 at 10:30 am Written Testimony Only Subject: Testimony in Opposition of Proposed SBl Relating to Equal Rights I am writing in opposition to the proposed Senate Bill 1, relating to Equal Rights that will be discussed in your Special Legislative Session beginning on October 28, 2013. I strongly feel that same gender marriage is contrary to our fundamental religious beliefs. We feel that marriage is a sacred union that is reserved for a man and a woman, whereby children are born, nurtured and best raised by the father and the mother who brought them into this world. The Bill that is being proposed extinguishes my religious liberty, and does not provide adequate protection clauses for clergies, religious organizations, its affiliates and individual members of the church. The Bill excludes any protection clauses for individuals and small businesses. As a small business owner, this infringes on my rights of free enterprise and freedom of choice. This Bill also excludes protection for our children in public schools and the negative content of their curriculum which will go against their religious teachings and upbringing. I humbly request that you VOTE IN OPPOSITION to SB 1 relating to Equal Rights. Sincerely, ~vL\u00a3_ i,eonard Tanaka 1390 Keneki Place Hilo, HI 96720 To the Committee on Judiciary and Labor, The following testimony is submitted for the public hearing regarding SB1 during the special session convening on 28 Oct 2013. The public hearing is scheduled for Monday, 28 Oct 2013 at 10:30 a.m. at the Capitol Auditorium. As a neighbor island resident, will not be testifying In person and request written te stimony provided be accepted for SB1, relating to equal rights. My personal beliefs are that marriage is ordained of God and the family unit is part of that designation, with a husband and wife providing a nurturing environment for their children. This has been the convention of the human race for thousands of years. That said, I recognize that there are many who do no t agree with my religious beliefs. We live in a Democratic Republic where the rights of the minority are not to be trampled by those of the majority. In our modern times, we have alternative lifestyles with people choosing not to have traditional marriage s. As fellow citizens, we all have unalienable rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. However, it is important that we do not trample on other people's freedom and the pursuit of their happiness. Public law is instituted to protect such f reedoms, whether they are regarding religious or moral beliefs . It is incumbent on law makers to provide equal protections for all citizens. Definition of Marriage: The convention of marriage is so fundamental to our society that we have great difficulty separating civil liberties and the marriage itself. The ruling of United States vs. Windsor against Section 3 of DOMA is that the Federal Government must recognize same -sex marriages approved by the states under the 5th Amendment's Due Process Clause. Th e case revolved around probate proceedings and the due process for a Canadian same -sex marriage recognized in New York. The Supreme Court ruling does not require the State of Hawaii to recognize or allow same -sex marriage. I had hoped that Civil Unions co uld be federal ly recognized and Due Process protection provided to all citizens without the redefinition of marriage. The legislature should consider seeking equal protection and Federal recognition of state recognized Civil Unions as an alternative. Yes , the draft bill states: \"It is the intent of the legislature that there be no legal distinction between same -sex married couples and opposite -sex married couples with respect to marriage under the laws of this State.\" It could also be worded that \"there be no legal distinction between same -sex civil union couples and opposite - sex married couples with respect to marriage protections under the laws of this State.\" Equal protections, Federal recognition and due process can be provided without redefining mar riage. In the event you disagree with the above arguments, let's consider a second option. Over the centuries, both religious and common law marriage became a civil institution. The Christian viewpoint of marriage included raising children, promoting mu tual fidelity and chastity, and be united man and wife in a bond of love derived from God. As this institution became widespread, Civil marriage has become, in the secular view, a public commitment to maintain a stable relationship in which they will supp ort one another and their dependents. Not to trample upon the religious protections of the First Amendment , the Supreme Court has ruled that \"the clause against establishment of religion by law was intended to erect 'a wall of separation between Church and State.'\" The cause of religious organizations should revolve around the separation between Religious Marriage and Civil Marriage. There should be an option for licensing to perform opposite -sex, same -sex or both types of marriage. If, on the basis of religious beliefs, an individual or religious institution refuses to perform same - sex marriage, they should be able to request a license limited to solemnization of opposite -sex marriages only. There may be clergy who refuse to perform opposite -sex marri ages. It would be equally unfair to force them to perform against their religious beliefs. Allowing them the option to be licensed to solemnize marriages according to their beliefs, would ensure that neither would be licensed to perform beyond their reli gious beliefs. If the legislature would prefer, specific definitions may be added to define Religious Marriage separately from Civil Marriage. Specific Concerns: \u00a7572 -C Right of parents. \"These rights shall incl ude, but are not limited to, paternity, mate rnity, and parentage presumptions based on marriage. \" o Consider the ramifications if an opposite -sex married couple divorces and the party with primary custody enters into same -sex marriage. Are the parental rights of biological parents protected against \"parentage presumptions based on marriage? \" Although custody proceedings are normally dictated by Family Court, this wording also introduces parentage rights of same -sex married couples into future custody proceedings . \u00a7572 -F Refusal to solemnize a marri age. \"Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to require any minister, priest, officer of any religious denomination or society, or religious society not having clergy but providing solemnizations that is authorized to perform solemnizations pursuant to this chapter to solemnize any marriage, and no such minister, priest, officer of any religious denomination or society, or religious society not having clergy that fails or refuses for any reason to solemnize any marriage under this section shall be subje ct to any fine, penalty, or other civil action for the failure or refusal. \" o If given the option to choose to be authorized for opposite -sex, same -sex or both marriages, may alleviate this problem. o The wording is overly complicated and leaves room for misi nterpretation . Other states have better protection statements. New York's Marriage Equality Bill states it as: \"A refusal by a benevolent organization or a religious corporation, incorporated under the education law or the religious corporations law, to provide accommodations, advantages, facilities or privileges in connection with section ten -a of this article shall not create a civil claim or cause of action.\" Vermont states it as: \"This section does not require a member of the clergy authorized to s olemnize a marriage as set forth in subsection (a) of this section, nor societies of Friends or Quakers, the Christadelphian Ecclesia, or the Baha'i Faith to solemnize any marriage, and any refusal to do so shall not create any civil claim or cause of acti on.\" o The current wording only protects individuals and not religious organizations from refusal to solemnize marriage. As subtle as this may seem, it does not prevent lawsuit s against religious organizations or societies for failure to perform same -sex ma rriages. \u00a7572 -G Religious organizations and facilities; liability exemption under certain circumstances. \"(a) A religious organization shall not be required to make a religious facility owned or leased by the religious organization available for solemniza tion of a particular marriage; provided that:\" o Section (a) should stop at the first line. NO religious organization should be required to make a religious facility owned or leased by that religious organization available for solemnization of a particular marriage. Subsections (1), (2), and (3) should be removed. o Vermont's 2010 Bill S -115 states: \"The civil marriage laws shall not be construed to affect the ability of a society to determine the admission of its members as provided in section 4464 of this title, or to determine the scope of beneficiaries in accordance with section 4477 of this title, and shall not require a society that has been established and is operating for charitable and educational purposes and which is operated, supervised, or contr olled by or in connection with a religious organization to provide insurance benefits to any person if to do so would violate the society's free exercise of religion, as guaranteed by the First Amendment to the Constitution of United States or by Chapter I , Article 3 or the Constitution of the State of Vermont.\" o New York's Marriage Equality Bill states: \"Notwithstanding any other provision of law, pursuant to subdivision nine of section two hundred ninety -two of the executive law, a corporation incorporate d under the benevolent orders law or described in the benevolent orders law but formed under any other law of this state or a religious corporation incorporated under the education law or the religious corporations laws shall be deemed to be in its nature distinctly private and therefore, shall not be required to provide accommodations, advantages, facilities or privileges related to the solemnization or celebration of a marriage. \" o There should be no restriction to the exemption of religious organizations f or providing facilities for a solemnization of a particular marriage. The State should not force religious organizations to perform or make available facilities if the performance of those marriages is contrary to their religious beliefs. Consider the wo rding of other states and the protections offered to their religious organizations. \"(a)(1) The religious facility is regularly used by the religious organization for its religious purposes;\" o Please consider how this will affect religious schools and edu cational institutions. If a school teaches certain religious values, does that constitute regular use for its religious purposes? How will this apply to a school gym that is requested to host a marriage they oppose? \"(a)(2) For solemnization of marriages pursuant to this chapter, the religious organization restricts use of the religious facility to its members; and\" o This item specifically discriminat es against interfaith marriages. Couples with varying religious ideals will be forced to become members o f one congregation in order to have this religious exemption. The State will be impairing the religious freedoms of interfaith couples. \"(a)(3) The religious organization does not operate the religious facility as a for -profit business.\" o The State should not force religious organizations operating for -profit businesses to act against their religious beliefs. This will have impact statewide to many small churches that rely on for -profit ventures for sustainment. They already have to abide by Excise Tax L aw for their for -profit ventures. They should be allowed exemption to perform their business without the state imposition on their religious beliefs. \"(b) A religious organization that refuses to make a religious facility available for solemnization of a marriage under subsection (a) shall not be subject to any fine, penalty, injunction, administrative proceeding, or civil liability for the refusal.\" o Cons ider revising with subsection (a) as follows: \"A religious organization shall not be required to make a religious facility owned or leased by the religious organization available for solemnization of a particular marriage; A religious organization that refuses to make a religious facility available for solemnization of a marriage shall not be subject to any fine, penalty, injunction, administrative proceeding, or civil liability for the refusal.\" \"(c) Nothing in this sectio n shall be interpreted to exempt the owner or operator of any religious facility from the requirements of chapter 489 if the religious facility is a place of public accommodation as defined in section 489 -2.\" o The definition of \"place of public accommodatio ns\" is defined as \"a business, accommodation, refreshment, entertainment, recreation, or transportation facility of any kind whose goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations are extended, offered, sold, or otherwise made availab le to the general public as customers, clients, or visitors.\" o This essentially provides no protection to religious institutions. If a visitor walks into to a church opposed to same -sex marriage and asks to use the bathroom, does this classify the religiou s facility as a \"place of public accommodation?\" If a church allows community basketball games but is opposed to same -sex marriage, they will face civil liability for refusal to allow such marriages at their facility. If the intent of the legislature is to have all churches opposed to same -sex marriage close their doors and take down \"public welcome\" signs, the end result is religious oppression by the law or threat of legal action. The State needs to separate itself from the regulation of religious orga nizations. o The legislature should consider striking the requirement for public accommodations if contrary to religious belief. The State of New York states: \"a religious corporation incorporated under the education law or the religious corporations laws shall be deemed to be in its nature distinctly private and therefore, shall not be required to provide accommodations, advantages, facilities or privileges related to the solemnization or celebration of a marriage. \" The State of Hawaii can make the same declaration to provide religious exemption for these organizations. \u00a7572C -2 Findings. Do not agree with the deletion of \"The legislature finds that the people of Hawaii choose to preserve the tradition of marriage as a unique social institution based upon the committed union of one man and one woman.\" o Hawaii, as a State, voted on the definition of marriage. This should not be struck from the public record. Additional discussion on the Supreme Court ruling and subsequent legislation should also be added. Do not agree with the deletion of \"marriage should be subject to restrictions such as prohibiting respective parties to a valid marriage contract from standing in relation to each other, i.e., brother and sister of the half as well as to the whole blood, u ncle and niece, aunt and nephew.\" o The remaining wording only provides cursory mention of prohibited legal restrictions with out definition . The example of the widowed mother and unmarried son leads one to believe that this marriage would be acceptable unde r the Marriage Equality Act. This would allow brothers, sisters, and other close relatives to intermarry leading one to question applicability of incest laws. As a member of my faith, I am opposed to the redefinition of marriage. As a citizen, I unders tand that the civil liberties of the same -sex community require addressing. Please consider the above revisions and concerns. I am gravely concerned that, in trying to provide equal protection for same -sex couples, the pendulum will swing too far and imp inge on the \"separation of church and state.\" Many in the community are concerned with what this means for sex education in schools, activists testing public tolerance of same -sex behavior and enticing individuals/organizations into civil lawsuits. When you look at the atmosphere in Massachusetts, there is increas ing intolerance of any viewpoint in favor of traditional marriage. Churches and religious organizations are being targeted for their beliefs that homosexuality is immoral. If this bill is not amended, it will provide opportunities for special rights grou ps to unjustly target religious groups. Please revise \u00a7572 -F and \u00a7572 -G to provide adequate religious exemption, as other states have also found it necessary. In the State of New York , \"a religious corporation incorporated under the education law or the religious corporations laws shall be deemed to be in its nature distinctly private and therefore, shall not be required to provide accommodations, advantages, facilities or privileges related to the solemnization or celebration of a marriage. \" If agreement on this cannot be reached, an amendment to HRS 489 -2 should be made to the effec t that: \"Public accommodations do not include a religious or nonprofit fraternal or soci al association or corporation.\" In reading the Americans with Disabilities Act Title III Technical Assistance Man ual, religious exempti on \"covers all of the activities of a religious entity, whether religious or secular. \" The examples provid ed also allowed exemptions for preschoo ls operated by religious e ntities . At the end of the day, this is about equality, both Equal Protection and Free Exercise . In providing equality for same -sex couples, we need to be wary about creating new inequalities against the free exercise of religion . SB1, as currently written, will prohibit the free exercise rights guaranteed by Section 4 of the Constitution of the State of Hawaii. Abraham K.

If enacted, the First Amendment constitutional rights of our citizens WILL be violated. I feel that the ramifications of the passage of this bill have not been adequately reviewed, reflected on, or considered. Many do not realize that passage of this bill will mean that eventually people will no longer have the freedom to believe what they want without suffering legal consequences. There are numerous such cases in other states and countries. While the intent of the bill may be to ensure equality, in fact, it will ensure equality for one group. For many others it will be an infringement upon basic constitutional rights to freedom of religion and speech. Why should such a controversial bill that has the potential to radically change the fabric of our society and culture be rushed through in a Special Session? Both sides should be honored and respected, and adequate time should be given to truly enact a bill that ensures Equal Rights. I urge you to consider my testimony, and to vote \"NO\" on SB1. Respectfully yours, Erin Haynes Please note that testimony submitted less than 24 hours prior to the hearing , improperly identified, or directed to the incorrect office, may not be posted online or distributed to the committee prior to the convening of the public hearing.

Same- sex marriage may be in the best interest of adult homosexuals who yearn for social and legal recognition of their unions, but it's not in the best interest of children. Proponents of same- sex marriage believe love is all children re ally need. Based on that supposition, they conclude it's just as good for children to be raised by loving parents of the same sex, as by loving parents of the opposite sex. But that basic assumption \u2014and all that flows from it \u2014is naively simplistic and deni es the complex nature and core needs of human beings. According to decades of research, the ideal family structure for children is a two- parent, mother -father family.(1,2,3) That research consistently shows that children raised in such families are more li kely to thrive \u2014psychologically, mentally, and physically \u2014than children reared in any other kind of family configuration. Extensive research also reveals that not only mothers, but also fathers, are critical to the healthy development of children. Swedish r esearchers reviewed the best longitudinal studies from around the world that assessed the effects of fathers on children's development. Their review spanned 20 years of studies and included over 22,000 children, and found that fathers reduce behavioral pro blems in boys and psychological problems in girls, enhance cognitive development, and decrease delinquency. (4) It's clear that children benefit from having both a male and female parent. Recent medical research confirms genetically determined differences between men and women and those fundamental differences help explain why mothers and fathers bring unique characteristics to parenting that can't be replicated by the other sex. Mothers and fathers simply aren't interchangeable. Two women can both be good m others, but neither can be a good father. One- sex parenting, whether by a single parent or a homosexual couple, deprives children of the full range of parenting offered by dual -sex couples. Only mother -father families afford children the opportunity to dev elop relationships with a parent of the same, as well as the opposite sex. Relationships with both sexes early in life make it easier and more comfortable for a child to relate to both sexes later in life. Overall, having a relationship with both a male and female parent increases the likelihood that a child will have successful social and romantic relationships during his or her life.(5) Moreover, existing research on children reared by homosexuals is not only scientifically flawed and extremely limited (6,7,8) but some of it actually indicates that those children are at increased risk for a variety of negative outcomes.(6) Other studies find that homosexually parented children are more likely to experiment sexually, experience sexual confusion, and engage in homosexual and bisexual behavior themselves.(5,6,9) And for those children who later engage in non- heterosexual behavior, extensive research reveals they are more likely to suffer from psychiatric disorders, abuse alcohol and drugs, (10) attempt suicide, (11) experience domestic violence and sexual assault, (12) and are at increased risk for chronic diseases, AIDS, and shortened life spans.(13,14,15) It shouldn't be surprising that studies find children reared by homosexuals are more likely to engage in homosexual behavior themselves (16,9,17) since extensive worldwide research reveals homosexuality is primarily environmentally induced. Specifically, social and/or family factors, as well as permissive environments which affirm homosexuality, play major environmental roles in the development of homosexual behavior.(18,19,20,21) There's no question that human sexuality is fluid and pliant.(22) Consider ancient Greece and Rome\u2014among many early civilizations \u2014where male homosexuality and bisexuality were nearly ubiquitous. That was not so because most of those men were born with a \"gay gene,\" rather because sexuality is malleable and socially infl uenced. Same -sex marriage no doubt will increase sexual confusion and sexual experimentation by young people. The implicit and explicit message of same- sex marriage is that all choices are equally acceptable and desirable. So even children from traditional homes \u2014influenced by the all -sexual -options -are-equal message\u2014 will grow up thinking it doesn't matter whom one relates to sexually or marries. Holding such a belief will lead some\u2014if not many \u2014young people to consider sexual and marital arrangements they never would have contemplated previously. It also must be expected that if society permits same- sex marriage, it also will have to allow other types of non-traditional marriage. The legal logic is simple: If prohibiting same- sex marriage is discriminatory, t hen disallowing polygamous marriage, polyamorous marriage, or any other marital grouping also will be deemed discriminatory. In fact, such legal maneuverings have already begun. The emotional and psychological ramifications of these assorted arrangements on the developing psyches and sexuality of children would be disastrous. To date, very little research exists that assesses long- term outcomes for homosexually parented children. According to Charlotte Patterson, a self -proclaimed, pro- same- sex-marriage res earcher, there are only two longitudinal studies of children raised by lesbians.(23) And no long- term studies of children raised by homosexual men. A professional organization dedicated to the welfare of its patients cannot and should not support drastic c hange in social policy based on just two, small and non- representative longitudinal studies. Certainly homosexual couples can be just as loving toward children as heterosexual couples, but children need more than love. They require the distinctive qualities and complementary natures of a male and female parent. The accumulated wisdom of over 5,000 years concludes that the ideal marital and parental configuration is composed of one man and one woman. This time- tested wisdom is now supported by the most advanced, scientifically sound research available. Importantly, and to their credit, many self -proclaimed pro- same -sex-marriage researchers acknowledge that there is as of yet no definitive evidence as to the impact of homosexual parenting on children. Regardless, some of those advocates support same- sex marriage because they believe it offers a natural laboratory in which to assess the long- term impact on children.(24) That position is unconscionable and indefensible. Same -sex marriage isn't in the best interes t of children. While we may empathize with those homosexuals who long to be married and parent children, we mustn't allow our compassion for them to trump our compassion for children. In a contest between the desires of some homosexuals and the needs of al l children, we cannot allow the children to lose. CAMFT, like all mental health organizations, must base policy decisions on scientific evidence and research findings, not personal belief and political opinion. Most importantly, they must never allow children to be used as guinea pigs in unwise and potentially harmful social experiments.

Everyone has always had an equal right to marry -- that is, to cohabit as man and wife with the possibility of producing offspring. The additional 'right' you are proposing will create legal equality for unions that cannot possibly produce offspring. Future generations is what marriage is about, as well as the biological di-morphism of the human being. By introducing and enforced equality between what is not in fact equal you may have your way but you do not change the facts of life. Congratulating yourself on making the naturally unequal legally equal in all the rights, priveledges, responsibilities, and, you openly admit it -- chance to get Federal benefits -- is misguided. You are creating a grand social mess that our schools and courts and families and, most deplorably, our children, will have to be sorting out for decades. I urge you to vote no on creating these new rights.

Beretania Street Honolulu, Hawaii 96813 Subject : Testimony in Opposition of Proposed Hawaii Marriage Equality Act of 2013 I am writing in opposition to the proposed Hawaii Marriage Equality Act of 2013 that will be discussed in your Special Legislative Session beginning on October 28, 2013. The United States of America, of which Hawai'i is a part of, has always been a democratic government. It is concerti ng to me that the government running Hawaii is considering passing a law that will not only affect the entire state of Hawai'i but supports the desires of the minority. I have two major concerns regarding the proposed bill #SB1. My first concern is that the bill will redefine the sanctity of marriage and demoralize society. If the purpose of this bill is to enable gay constitutes to receive benefits, which married couples receive, then give them these benefits and create another law for them along with an other terminology besides calling it \"marriage\". THE RIGHTS OF THOSE WHO BELIEVE IN GOD AND HIS COMMANDMENTS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED BY THE HAWAI'I GOVERNMENT AS EQUALLY IMPORTANT AS THE RIGHTS OF THOSE WHO DO NOT. I firmly believe that our society is in rapid decay and it is for reasons such as this. I also firmly believe that calling the union between gay partners a marriage will enhance the detriment of our society in Hawaii. As an educator for the past thirteen years, I teach the whole child, which include s not only academics, but ethics and morals as well. I have been an active voter since the age of eighteen and I ask that you enable the voice of the people and LET THE PEOPLE VOTE on this issue. My second concern is the right of religious freedom. The c onstitution of the United States of America, of which Hawaii is a part of, supports religious freedom. Courageous people seeking this very freedom created our country's heritage. I ask that this proposed law be rewritten so that sufficient protections are put in place protecting the religious rights of our people. I ask that religious organizations and businesses be exempted from this proposed law. For a religious organization to be expected to marry a gay couple would be against the very principles of that organization; it would infringe upon their beliefs. Such an organization could not morally obey the laws of the land when doing so will hold such an organization in contempt of GOD! If you as the Leaders of our \"Hawaiian Paradise\" should elect to take th is decision upon your shoulders, I ask that you do not infringe upon the rights of others in order to make some happy. For these reasons, I humbly request that you VOTE IN OPPOSITION to Hawaii Marriage Equality Act of 2013. Sincerely, Sonya M. Carvalho 2644 Ainaola Drive Hilo, Hawai'i 96720 October 27, 2013 Senate Committee on Judiciary and Labor Re: Bill #SB1 Hawaii State Capitol 415 S. Beretania Street Honolulu, Hawaii 96813 Subject: Testimony in Opposition of Proposed Hawaii Marriage Equality Act of 2013 I am a citizen of the United States, born and raised in Hilo, Hawaii. I've lived here my whole life, I may only be 21 but I'm using my right to speak up. I am taking this opportunity to voice my concerns about the same- sex marriage bill that is being propo sed at this time. I'm pleading with you to not only consider those who want this bill passed, but to consider what it will do if this bill gets passed. We all have a right to have our freedom. But if this bill gets passed you'll take away o ur freedom. Since when does one groups' beliefs come more important than someone else's. To force someone to go against what they don't believe. Is that freedom? No, it is not. It's just like we pushing our values that a marriage should be between a man and a woman, but we don't push that fact on those who believe otherwise. That's because everyone has their agency, it's their right to choose. But if this bill gets passed you take away our right to choose. You take away the right of those who believe in the sanctity of marriage which is God's definition of marriage, and the right to religious freedom. We as members of a religious organization, are taught to respect others beliefs. By enforcing someone to act against their religious beliefs is not respecting us as individuals. As a kid when you were forced to do something you did not want to do what happened? Usually one will rebel, because they feel trapped. I know those who are pushing for this bill to take place, are only concerned about their feelings; but where's the dignity and respect for those who don't believe the same way. You are in this political position because we voted for you. If you vote to pass this bill you will be taking away our freedom, and consequently how easy would be to take away more freedoms. Our forefathers believed in religious freedom. If you vote to pass this bill, you will be going against our constitution, which made us the country we are. History will repeat itself, and we will not be the nation we were meant to be. Please don't let this bill pass, not because you agree or disagree in same- sex marriage, but because you respect everyone's freedom; including yours.

Re: In Opposition to S.B. 1: The Hawaii Marriage Equality Act of 2013 Dear Senate Committee on Judiciary and Labor , I am opposed to S .B.1, The Hawaii Marriage Equality Act of 2013, because 1. It denies individual citizens their First Amendment right of freedom of religion, and ultimately also denies individual citizens the right of free speech and lawful assembly. 2. It is in utter opposition to the will of Hawaii voters who voted in 1998 to define marriage exclusively between a man and women in the Hawaii constitution. More than 250,000 Hawaii voters expressed their resolute position on the definition of marriage as exclusively between a man and women. The language \"reserve marriage\" indicates that the people of Hawaii recognize that the institute of marriage deserves and demands special consideration and criteria, one man and one woman exclusively. 3. It denies business owners their First Amendment right of freedom of religion and ultimately also denies individual citizens the right of free speech and lawful assembly . 4. It re-defines the most core institution of society, marriage without regard to the impact and consequences on Hawaii, society, the community, and individual rights . 5. It fails to protect churches, religious groups and temples from lawsuits. It fails to protect church -affiliated organizations (universities, hospitals, adoption agencies, housing agencies, etc.) from lawsuits. It fails to protect bishops, priests and other clergy members from lawsuits. 6. It is fast -tracked through a process that does not offer Neighbor Island individuals the opportunity to present testimon y in person. 7. It appears to be the act of the State of Hawaii Executive Branch and the Legislature to put the 'wants' of non - residents of Hawaii over the needs and will of residents of the people of Hawaii and the registered voters of Hawaii. 8. It appears to be the act of a legislative body attempting to ignore the firmly expressed will of registered Hawaii voters and bypass the voters of Hawaii who have already voted on this issue . 9. It appears to be the first act of a legislative body being forced to pass legi slation by a n Executive Branch attempting to show its first step in showing its power over the people of Hawaii . 10. It excludes legislative representatives of some registered voters of Hawaii the process and opportunity to vote on the legislation. This violates the US Cons titution guaranteed right for the people to be represented in the legislation process. I urge you to vote NO on S .B. 1. Thank you for your time and leadership.

This is my home and where my family and extended fa mily reside. We are voters and are grateful for this privilege. 'Marriage between a man and a woman is the bedrock of society' and I am committed to strengthening traditional marriage between a man and a woman. I am opposed to same -sex marriage legalization (Hawaii Marriage Equality Act of 2013) and to all the negative ramifications that come with it. I remember my vote and the votes of residents of Hawaii deciding years ago to keep tradition al marriage between a man and a woman. It is disempowering for a nation, a state, and any governing body to over rule such personal and collective power. What kind of leadership would usurp such a fundamental right and collective choice that was decided upon ? The adverse consequences of doing so has ramifications all its own. The consequences are grave. Recently , in regards to Supreme Court marria ge rulings , not only did California also vote and confirm that marriage is between a man and a woman, but now there is more concern. M any wonder if there is something fundamentally wrong when our government will not defend or protect a popular vote that reflects the views of a majority of their citizens. The effect of the ruling raises further complex issues , including but not limited to jurisdictional. There are real issues that need to be resolved as well as fundamental rights that not only same- sex marriage argue, but that those who are against same- sex marriage argue, who happen to be the majority here in Hawai i. Please refrain from passing anything that would deny our rights, including religious freedoms. Study the issues at hand and do not be so quick to make a law before solving further issues that arise from such an act as the marriage equality act. TESTIMONY BEFORE THE SENATE COMMITTEE ON JUDICIARY AND LABOR IN OPPOSITION OF SB 1 RELATING TO EQUALITY DATE OF HEARING: MON ., OCTOBER 28, 2013 TIME: 10:30 A.M. PLACE: AUDITORIUM, STATE CAPITOL Dear Senator Hee, Vice Chair Shimabukuro and Members of the Senate Committee on Judiciary and Labor : I am strongl y opposed to Senate Bil l One. This legislation does not cover equality. The language appears to be vague and would harm religious organizations, small business owners, government employees, and judges whose religious beliefs are not that of the gay/lesbian community. Passage of this bill will affect the sanctity of marriage between one man and one woman. I believe that SB1 does not represent the best interests of the majority of the people of Hawaii. Please do not allow this type of legislation to be passed. Charlotte Y. Hee Testimony Special Legislative hearing , same sex marriage. HB 1 and or SB 1. Opposition , October 27th, 2013 From Tula and Cam Cavasso , Retired State Rep resentative. Dear Committee Chairm en and members, We address our opposition to and ask you to vote against this bill for two key reasons. Number one this bill attacks the freedom of faith, the freedom of religion, a fundamental right so important to our nations value system that it was specifically cove red in our Bill of Rights by the very First Amendment to our US Constitution before ratification. \"Congress shall make no law respecting the establishment of religion, neither shall it deny the free exercise thereof\". This bill has the effectual result of denying the f ree exercise of faith or religion by individuals, organizations, businesses, schools, churches, synagogues , or places of worship. Number two, this bill as written has the secondary effect of reverse discrimination against those who by faith and religious written doctrine believe in specific sexual moral values and behavior respecting their families, parenting, relationships, home building, education, and daily practices in every aspect of life. This bill effectively grants or places into law a preferred \"Civil Rights \" status based on a moral or chosen behavior lifestyle to the exclusion of other moral lifestyles beliefs and values , far beyond the immutable characteristics of regular civil rights protections such as for race, gender or n ational origin which are based not on action or morality, but on birth. Proponents of this bill claim the religious exclusion or exemptions will protect people of faith and religious values, practices and churches. This claim of protection is untrue. The so called religious protection clause s neither effectively protect s religious free speech and lifestyle nor do es it protect their freedom of assembly in religious social settings or churches. This bill as proposed will effectively serve to quell free speech and assembly based on the moral values relating to sexuality , marriage, family and every other aspect of our Hawaii community. The chairman of the Hawaii Civil Rights commission has already publicly expressed sentiments making it clear that if this bill is passed into law that he will use it drag into court by lawsuit , individuals, business people and leaders of assemblies, pitting them against the financial and intimidating power of the State. In other words it is apparent that this bill, if passe d, will be used to quell free religious speech. The subject , wording and ramifications of this bill need much greater study both of impact and long term ramifications including its unintended consequence in all aspects of our community. We have addressed only two of many reasons to recommit this bill for reconsideration in the Regular Session beginning in January for the much more detailed study of the current and future consequence s it deserves. Please do not rush this highly emotional and complicated su bject to half considered action. We respectfully ask you to you hold this bill . Commented [CC1]: October 25, 2013 Kari L.

Redefining marriage not only affects the estimated 5% ofHawai'i residents who identify themselves as Gay or Lesbian, but will change society forever for the other 95% of Hawai' i residents. Changing the definition of marriage is changing the morals of our society. As our school system is the means to educate our children on the laws and morals of our Society, passing this bill will also greatly affect the curriculum taught to all of our children. This is something that should be decided by the people, and not by a handful of politicians. If the majority of our people feel that having a Gay or Lesbian marriage is an acceptable alternative to heterosexual marriage, then so be it. But LET THE PEOPLE VOTE! If perhaps the majority of people in Hawai'i do feel that they would like Same-sex marriage to be deemed as an acceptable alternative to heterosexual marriage then it would be important that sufficient protections are put in place so that the religious rights of our people are not infringed upon. Religious Freedom is one of the founding principles of our country. It is not uncommon knowledge that the bible teaches that Gay and Lesbian relationships are against the laws of God. It is not a new radical philosophy but a moral principle that has been in place for thousands of years. It is a principle that even our founding forefathers believed in. Although society is changing , the bible has not changed, and many people still uphold the principles in the bible. It is their religious right to do so. To require any religious leader, organization, small business or individual to provide goods or services that assist or promote the solemnization or celebration of any marriage, or pr.ovide counseling or other services that directly facilitate the perpetuation of any marriage that is against their religious beliefs would be infringing on their religious rights.

As a vote r in the district you represent, I feel that it is important for you to know how I feel about this as part of your decision making process. I believe that the public should vote on the issue of Same Sex Marriage on just as we did back in 1998, when the maj ority of citizens in the State of Hawaii voted to approve marriage between a man and a woman. The needs to be informed of any legal issues that will affect our lives and we need to be given time to discuss these issues, not the way Governor Abercrombie is acting now. The use of a special session limits my opportunity to voice my opinion on this issue and may result in legislation that does not represent the will of the people you have been elected to represent. This Special Session does not warrant enough time to address detrimental consequences to family unity, confusion to promiscuity to young adolescents, a born nature, which in the 21 century there is no DNA, blood test this is an inherited or biological born behavior not proven ever. This SB1 must put in the ballot for citizens to make a decision. In closing, I greatly appreciate your representation of the constituents of District # 10. Again, I am asserting my opposition to same sex marriage, request be given enough time to be to discuss issues so it c ould be given on the ballot for the people to vote.

In regards to this bill, I would like to testify in opposition to Senate Bill 1. I am opposed to Senate Bill 1 because of the inadequate protections it establishes for religious institutions. As a very devout member of my religion, I feel very passionately that our buildings, meetinghouses, and places of worship be used only for purposes that directly align with our religious beliefs. I feel that is is unconstitutional and unlawful to force any religious group to serve, accommodate, or celebrate those marriages that go against what their church teaches and practices. Senate Bill 1 w ould take away my rights to freedom of religion as our founding fathers intended them to be. Again, I would like to reiterate that I am AGAINST Senate Bill one, and that I firmly oppose its passing into state legislature.

Subject: Special Session on Same- Gender Marriage Dear Senator Donna Mercado Kim : Tha nk you for your commitment to serve and represent the people of our District. I truly appreciate that you have committed yourself to such an important calling in life. As my Senator , I ask you to consider and make known among your peers my position on a very important issue. I urge you to vote \"no\" to legalizing same- gender marriage during the special legislative session that has been called by Governor Abercrombie on October 28, 2013. My primary concern is the inherent risk that the law would have on my First Amendment rights, to express my freedom of religion, as well as the impact that it would likely have on my church community and other religious organizations. The bill currently features language intended to provide religious exemptions to protect churches from being forced to perform same- gender marriages that are in direct conflict with their beliefs. However, the religious exemptions will not protect all churches in Hawaii. Further, if forced, it can lead to lengthy and costly lawsuits that could lead some churches to eventually close down due to financial costs. This would end important community programs that help feed the hungry and provide a wide range of support to Hawaii residents in need. Personally, I also stand to lose the right to express my religious views on traditional marriage between one man and one woman, whether in the workplace or in public, just as others are able to express their differing views. I believe that this decision is one that should be made by the people of the State of Hawaii, as was done in 1998 when it was voted on as a constitutional amendment. I strongly feel that this special session of the legislature does not provide an adequate opportunity for people to voice their opinions. However, if the people of Hawaii will not be given the opportunity to vote on this issue, I ask you to appeal to your fellow lawmakers to take the time necessary to revise this bill in order to ensure that no one will lose their existing right to express their religious beliefs as originally granted to all Americans. I trust that you will ensure that these concerns are heard during the special session. Thank you so much for your careful consideration of this matter. Yours truly, Cherie Kapololu October 25, 2013Ju OPPOSITION TO SB 1 RELATING TO EQUALITYDear Honorable Chair Hee and Members of the Committee on Judiciary and Labor,Thank you so much for taking the time to read this. Knowing that my voice is being heard in this very important matter brings me reassurance, but at the same time the people's voice in Hawaii that are not heard due to this special session is very disturbing. I believe that the people should be allowed to decide on this issue of marriage and I am pleading with you to support equality for all including the rights of conscience and religious freedom, which I ask you to respect as our elected leaders. Please give this bill the due process it needs in a regular session where it can probperly be vetted and examined as all other bills. Y our \"yes\" vote in special session is clearly a NO vote to democracy. Thank you once again for this opportunity to testify. Sincerely yours,Ju FrigillanaMIlilani, Hi 96789Sincerely yours,Written Testimony Regarding SB 1 Relating to Equal Rights To: The Committee on Judiciary and Labor My name is Stuart Shigemitsu . In 2009, I inquired of then Senator Russell Kokubun what his stance was regarding HB 444 relating to civil unions. I have copied our email correspondence below to demonstrate that my concerns voiced over four years have now been realized as the Hawaii Legislature stands on the cusp of legalizing same sex marriage in our State. Despite Senato r Kokubun's assurance that the legalization of civil unions would not change \"the definition or character of traditional marriage\" the passage of time has invalidated Senator Kokobun's claim. Governor Abercrombie signed civil unions into law in 2011 and n ow with this special session of the State Legislature, the definition or character of traditional marriage is most definitely in jeopardy. Sent: Tuesday, February 24, 2009 2:06:01 PM Subject: HB 444 Mahalo for taking the time to submit your comments reg arding House Bill 444, the pending civil union bill that is now under consideration in the State Legislature. Hawai`i has a history of recognizing personal and cultural differences. This is not about gay rights; it is about civil rights, and our communit y's respect for the lives and beliefs of others. Civil unions convey those rights and duties without changing the definition or character of traditional marriage. It is my understanding that civil unions are not marriage. They will extend a basic social and legal right to a new group of individuals without altering or diminishing what we now think of as marriage. It has been a guiding principle of our community to respect individuals' differences. In matters of religion, culture and lifestyle, Hawai`i has stood as one of the most welcoming and tolerant places in our nation. I will keep an open mind with respect to any and all input. I truly appreciate your efforts to communicate your thoughts and opinions on this critical issue. Mahalo, Senator Russe ll Kokubun Sent: Tuesday, February 24, 2009 PM Subject: Re: HB 444 To Sen. Russell Kokubun Feb 24, 2009 Dear Senator Kokubun, I have not written any correspondence to a politician in over 15 years as I feel that politicians in general tend to di sregard public input, especially pertaining to those issues on which they have already taken a firm stand. Nonetheless, I find it necessary to write to you due to my concern regarding HB 444. As you well know in 1998, by almost a 70% majority, the people of Hawaii (myself included) voted to amend the State's constitution allowing the legislature to ban same- sex marriages in Hawaii. I see this piece of legislation as an attempt to circumvent the will of the people & legislatively dictate what gay rights proponents could not accomplish 10 years ago. It is disturbing to me that the legislature and in other instances the judiciary, have taken it upon themselves to usurp the expressed will of the people. I do not have any ill -will against gay people, but rath er, with all due respect, I take issue with your statement that \"civil unions convey those rights and duties without changing the definition or character of traditional marriage.\" I do not believe that you can separate the two, as the former will always impact the latter. Case in point, the bellwether State of California. Back in 1999, California enacted a domestic partnership registry which initially allowed only hospital visitation privileges to gay couples but was later expanded to allow many of the same rights as married couples. Later on in 2000, the residents of California voted in favor of Proposition 22 which by statute defined marriage as between a man & a woman. Despite this law, the mayor of San Francisco in 2004, began allowing same -sex marriages in his city which subsequently led to the California Supreme Court striking down Prop. 22. Just last year, the California voters again voiced their opinion on same -sex marriages by voting for Proposition 8 which constitutionally defines marriage as being only between a man & a woman. The subsequent backlash in the gay community was vociferous & widespread, resulting in multiple ongoing lawsuits to undo Prop. 8. My point in documenting the preceding is to simply state that the slippery slope of civi l unions leading to marriage between gay couples in Hawaii is a sure one & will become inevitable should HB 444 be approved in the Senate. The history of this debate in California has made it evident that the plea for basic \"civil rights\" will not satisfy those in the gay community until gay couples are allowed to marry & then I am afraid that the \"definition & character\" of traditional marriage will be forever altered. I firmly believe in tolerance & respect for all, but not at the expense of traditional marriage. I therefore urge you to act accordingly. Sincerely, Stuart Shigemitsu To senkokubun@capitol.hawaii.gov Mar 24, 2009 Dear Senator Kokubun: Since this piece of legislation is still very much alive in the legislature, could you please take the time to respond to my response regarding your position of HB 444? Frankly, I don't know how one can absolutely claim that traditional marriage will in no way be affected as detailed in my response below. I would be interested in hearing your response. Thank you kindly, Stuart Shigemitsu Unfortunately, I received no further response from Senator Kokubun . Fast -forward only a few short years and t he citizens of our State now find ourselves in the exact position that I predicted would happen if civil union s were made legal by our chosen political representatives. A few years ago, sexu al orientation used to be referred to as sexual preference. This distinction in terms is significant because the two terms denote sig nificant differences in the manner by whic h sexuality develops. A preference is something that is chosen, whereas orientation is merely something that defines us. The differences are potentially important regarding how the law applies to those who are gay. If homosexuality doe s not stem from perso nal choice but is a biologically -determined characteristic over which we have no choice, then laws should not treat gays and straights differently since homosexuality would be equivalent to one's race, over which we have no control. Conversely, if being gay is indeed the res ult of choice and not biologically or genetically determined, then granting marriage rights based upon personal choice is inherently problematic. Pertinent questions arise such as who has the authority to define marriage - the citizens or the legislature? If the legal right to marry is granted to gays then should not the right to marry be given to those who practice polygamy as well? After all, we should not discriminate against polygamists should we? If gays are granted the right to marry others of the same sex, is it not logically consistent to also allow others to marry multiple partners , if they so choose? Where do we draw the line concerning defining marriage and who draws that line? Moral relativism is the real issue here. We are confronted by it and cannot evade the dilemma of the morally slippery slope. Despite much research, there is no empirical evidence that homosexuality is genetically based. In fact this evidence points to the opposite. Outlined below is a partial summary by Dr. Neil Whitehead of more than 20 years of scientific research into homosexuality. It draws on more than 10,000 scientific papers and publications from all sides of the debate. His findings regarding same -sex attraction versus opposite -sex att raction reveal the following: Change The huge amount of change in sexual orientation is one of the clearest evidences that homosexuality is not hard -wired by genes or anything in the biological environment. Large studies now show that: For adults: About half of those with exclusive SSA move towards heterosexuality over a lifetime. Put another way, 3% of the practising heterosexual population (both men and women) claim to have once been either bisexual or homosexual. These changes are not therapeu tically induced, but happen \"naturally\" in life, some very quickly. Most changes in sexual orientation are towards exclusive heterosexuality. Numbers of people who have changed towards exclusive OSA are greater than current numbers of bisexuals and exclusive SSA people combined. In other words, \"Ex -gays outnumber actual gays.\" Exclusive OSA is 17 times as stable as exclusive SSA for men, and 30 times as stable as exclusive SSA for women. (Women move about more in their sexual orientation than me n.) For adolescents: Most teenagers will change from SSA. In fact, in the 16 to 17 year age group, 98% will move from homosexuality and bisexuality towards heterosexuality. 16 year olds saying they are SSA or Bi- attracted are 25 times more likely to say they are opposite sex attracted at the age of 17 than those with a heterosexual orientation are likely to identify themselves as bi-sexual or homosexual. 16-year olds who claim they are opposite sex attracted will overwhelmingly remain that way. Genes Twin Studies: These very complex comparisons of identical twins and non -identical twins definitively rule out genetic determinism. Identical twins with identical genes a re about 11 -14% concordant for SSA. If homosexuality were \"genetic,\" identical co -twins of homosexual men and women would also be homosexual 100% of the time. In classic twin studies the genetic fraction is less than 23% for men and 37% for women, and may be as low as 10%. Twin studies continue to find steadily lower genetic input into homosexuality as methodology improves and samples become larger. Everyone has at least a 10% genetic influence in their behaviour\u2014 because without genes there can be no human behaviour of any kind. Twin studies show that individualistic reactions to chance events (in which one identical twin reacts differently from the other) are by far the strongest contributors to homosexuality. In other words personal individual reactions t o random events are a strong factor. Other A scan of the whole genome has not found any homosexual genes, unlike the case for schizophrenia (which has still only identified 4 genes linked to 3%of schizophrenia.) From an understanding of gene struct ure and func -tion there are no plausible means by which genes could dictate SSA (or other behaviours) in a person. So far, genetically dictated behaviours of the \"one -gene -one-trait\" variety have been found only in very simple organisms. Generally, gen eticists agree that many genes (from at least five or six to many - hundreds) contribute to any particular human behaviour. Any genetic influence is believed to be weak and indirect. No genetically determined human behaviour has yet been found. The most closely genetically -related behaviour yet discovered (mono -amine oxidase deficiency leading to aggression) has shown itself remarkably re -sponsive to counselling. A genetically dominated SSA caused by a cluster of genes could not suddenly appear a nd disappear in families, as it does. It would persist through every generation for many generations. It is genetically implausible that many \"heterosexual\" genes could switch off at the same time. The human race shares most of its genes \u2014something betw een 99.7%and 99.9%. That means all ethnic groups will have most of them. This has three implications. If homosexuality is genetically dictated, homosexual practices will be identical or very similar in all cultures. But the enormous range and diversity of homosexual practice and customs in different cultures (and within cultures), argues against this. There would be a similar percentage of homosexuality in all cultures. But homosexuality has been unknown in some cultures and mandatory in others. Changes in homosexual practice and behaviour in different cultures would take place very slowly, over many centuries. But this is not what history shows. (The decline of whole models of homosexuality (the Greek, over a couple of centuries, and the Melanes ian, within a century); the relatively sudden (in genetic terms) emergence of the present Western model over a couple of centuries; and abrupt changes of practice within an ethnic group, even over a single generation, are not consistent with anything genetic. Even less so the swiftly changing sexual practices within the current Western model.) The occurrence of SSA in the population is too frequent to be caused by a faulty pre -natal developmental process, so it is not innate in that sense either. This i ncludes epigenetic processes. If SSA were genetically determined, and led to same- sex contact only it would have bred itself out of the population in only several generations. It would not exist today. The age of first same -sex attraction could be about 10 % genetically influenced and opposite sex attraction about 15%. (Remember, everyone has a 10% genetic input into anything they think or do.) First attractions (both SSA and OSA) occur on average at age 10 and are rarely \"earliest memories,\" meaning attract ion is mostly socially induced. According to Dr. Whitehead, \"At best genetics is a minor factor. \" Because identical twins are always genetically identical, homosexuality cannot be genetically dictated. \"No -one is born gay,\" he notes. \"The predominant thi ngs that create homosexuality in one identical twin and not in the other have to be post -birth factors.\" Dr. Whitehead believes same- sex attraction (SSA) is caused by \"non -shared factors,\" things happening to one twin but not the other, or a personal respo nse to an event by one of the twins and not the other. The complete summary and further details can be found at: http://www.mygenes.co.nz/summary.htm Based on the above I think it would be a grievou s mistake to redefine the definition of marriage without any empirical evidence to support such an action. Lastly, allow me to make the argument from the perso nal standpoint. As parents do you wish and hope that one day your own children will grow up and marry someone else of the same sex? Or, do you wish and hope that your child will marry someone of the opposite sex and perhaps have grandchildren in the future. I submit that most parents would prefer the later outcome for their children. Redefining traditional marriage in our State would certainly affect that outcome as children would then be taught in the public arena that same sex relationships are acceptable since there is no difference between SSA and OSA. The inculcation of the gay lifestyle as b eing acceptable among our children is already taking place as evidenced most recently in New York where the IFC Center announce that it will admit minors to see the NC -17 rated movie Blue Is The Warmest Color which is a story about lesbianism. No matter from which angle you view this piece of legislation, it all boils down to a question of morality. Therefore, I urge you to do the right thing and reject SB 1. Thank you for the opportunity to submit my testimony. Stuart Shigemitsu Clayton Hee, Chair Senate Committee on Judiciary and Labor Re: TESTIMONY IN OPPOSITION TO SB 1 RELATING TO EQUALITY Submitted by: Barbara O'Nale 92 -6048 Kohi St, Kapolei, HI 96707 Dear Honorable Chair Hee and Members of the Committee on Judiciary and Labor: I am opposed to this bill because it is circumventing the normal process a bill should go through. It is my understanding that the legislature did not have the votes to call a special session. The Governor would not have called a special session if this was not a political agenda he wanted to push. The Democrat Party of Hawaii investigative panel has already shown its bias by recommending reprimand for Sen. Gabbbard and for Rep. Har to be censured for introducing a constitutional amendment on traditional marriage. The panel concluded that the party has a First Amendment right of free association to enforce its membership requirements, and that \"they violated the membership requirements of the DPH to the extent that sanctions may be applied to them that affect their membership in the organization.... Sen Gabbard was censored in 2009 for violating the platform on equal rights by actively working against a civil -unions bill.\" (Honolulu Star-Advertiser 26 July 2013) With Free Speech Week occurring just last week, it is a reminder of how appalling it is that activists have been allowed to elevate a party platform at the expense of the Constitutional Amendment of free speech to express an opposing view, especiall y when affecting representation of constituents. Richard Borreca in his column on 25 October 2013 in the Honolulu Star -Advertiser states, \"Legislators say they are all plowing through a deluge of emails and a constant hum of phone calls, mostly from membe rs of the public opposed.\" If this is true, is political pressure from threat of censorship and standing in the Democrat Party exerting more influence on a legislator's vote than the view of the constituents who elected them? As this could be any contentious issue, a no vote on this bill in special session would show respect for the normal democratic process of passing a bill and give citizens the confidence that elected officials are not succumbing to political pressure from threats by activists instead of representing them. A yes vote validates this circumventing of the process for activists to use in the future to push an agenda that failed during the regular legislative session. Respectfully submitted, Barbara O'Nale First of all, I am opposed to this special session on Same -Sex Marriage (to be referred to as SSM). I would like to see this session suspended immediately on the following grounds: 1. There is no legitimate reason for a special session on SSM. A decision on this issue is not mandated by the U.S. Supreme Court nor is there any deadline for such a legislation to be made. It appears that this issue is being rushed and manipulated for political , and possibly personal gain. 2. It is an erroneous step to rush into a decision on an issue that will have such an immense impact and consequence on the future of the islands and its people. This is a decision that will affect the future of our state like no other decision. It will have social, economic, and political impacts that will profoundly affect the future generations of our state , but impacts that I believe will be negative and subversive in nature . Secondly, it is my firm belief that the issue of SSM should be addressed directly by the people. This issue should be presented before the people as a constitutional amendment on the next election ballot f or the following reasons: 1. A constitutional amendment on the next election ballot will allow every voice to be heard fairly. 2. The constitutional amendment th at allows the legislature to decide on the issue of marriage is over 10 years old. Keep in mind that a census is taken every 10 years to account for changes in district representation. As population shifts over time, so do attitudes and beliefs on issues . It is time for the people to be heard from again. If this special session should proceed on this issue, please vote AGAINST this bill to legalize SSM and let the people decide. Sincerely, Spike Tanaka To: Senate Committee on Judiciary and Labor Hearing Date/Time: Monday, October 28, 2013, 10:30 a.m. Place: Capitol Auditorium Re: Strong Opposition of SB1 Dear Chair Hee and Members of the Committee on Judiciary and Labor: I strongly oppose Bill SB1. Why? (1) It has serious violations of religious rights. The governor's bill was hastily written, and he has already amended it once. That is witness enough it needs more discussion and re fining, which is the responsibility of the legislature. (2) It violates many federal and state granted constitutional rights. I agree that everyone should be treated equally under the law. However, the Governor and AG's Marriage Equality Bill violates religious First Amendment rights to a clear majority of the people of the state of Hawaii. It clearly violates Section 4 of the Constitution of the State of Hawaii. (3) The granted exceptions and exemptions for religious groups are too weak and too restricti ve. All religions that define marriage as the union of a male and a female, must be exempted permanently and forever from having to perform a civil union. (This freedom is constitutionally guaranteed under our First Amendment rights.) \"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.\" If our exercise (which it is) is to only recognize marriage as the union of a male and a female, our clergy can never be forced to perform a civil union or to unite two members of the same sex in a formal legally recognized family relationship without violating their First Amendment rights. This is where we must insist that the State of Hawaii CANNOT under any circumstance dictate our religious ceremonies or activitie s, or enact or create any law that restricts our constitutional freedoms. Small businesses also must not be forced to support civil unions when it runs against their religious beliefs, even if they offer services to the public. Again, that is a clear Firs t Amendment violation. It frankly would also minimally be a clear violation of the 14th Amendment, Section 1. Allow the people to decide on the issue of marriage. The legislature appears tp be going against the will of the people the way votes are align ed. Again, I support equality for all including the rights of conscience and religious freedom, which I ask you to respect as our elected leaders. It is foolish that the most contentious social issue in our history would be decided in one week. Uphold the principles of democracy and the democratic process which are being disregarded in this special session, and allow the people to vote. Any bill on this subject should be given due process during the regular session where it can properly be vetted and exam ined as is done with all other bills. The people who elected you to serve as their voices should have a say in public policy that will forever obliterate thousand of years of indigenous and non-native culture, customs and traditions. Any \"yes\" vote in spec ial session is a NO vote to democracy and to equal rights for everyone! Thank you for the opportunity to testify. Colin White Honolulu, HI 96819 October 27, 2013 Hawaii State Capitol Senator Clayton Hee , Chair Reference: SB1 Relating to Equal Rights Date: Monday, October 28, 2013 Time: 10:30 a.m. Written Testimony Dear Sir: I am a parent who is not related to any organization but I am deeply concerned that the passing of this bill will bring future ramifications and divide this island even more than it already is. I find it hard to understand why the legislature would have a special session to rush this bill through. This is not an equal rights issue, just disguised as one. Many of us believed that when the civil union bill was passed that the issue of spousal rights was addressed . I sat in the hearing and heard testimony after testimony that they (same sex couples) did want marriage, so to speak, but the rights that went with marriage and the Civil Union Bill was passed. My concern is that if this bill is passed that it will be mandated that homosexuality be taught at all grade levels starting from kindergarten. I do not want Hawaii to mirror Massachusetts where a father can be arrested and taken away in handcuffs simply because he wanted to exercise his parental right not to have his child taught that which he does not bel ieve to be right. No one can say that same sex couples are denied the right to vote, the right to enter into a restaurant of their choice, the right to rent a home or any of that. The people of Hawaii are not without prejudice, but dare I say we are far m ore tolerant than that of our mainland counterparts. We are logistically isolated and therefore have learned to live with one another for the most part in harmony. Why are we allowing special interest groups from the outside to influence our island traditions and alter our Hawaiian lifestyle? I humbly ask that those who were placed in office to hear the voice of the people, LISTEN! The passing of this bill will deeply divide the islands and your constituents.

While I believed in equal rights, there is nothing equal about this bill. Same sex couples already receive all of thei r state benefits through the Civil Union Law and have access to their federal benefits through the recent Supreme Court ruling. Meanwhile, this bill will negatively impact indviduals, religious organizations and their affiliates. Just because the public ac commadation section was deleted from the final verison of the bill, it does not mean that religious organizations and their affiliates are not subject to the public accommadations law. An entire state department does not just disappear overnight. Hawaii Ci vil Rights Commission will still enforce the public accommdations laws and with no protection written into our current bills, many religious organizations and their affiliates will be left vulnerable. Washington, a very libral state, has explicitly stated i n their laws that even if a religious organization is considered to be a public accommadation, they still cannot be sued. In addition, this bill violates our First Amendment rights, the freedom of regligion. As a basic constitutional right, everyone should have the right to believe and practice what they believe in. They should not be forced to participate in anything goes against their religious beliefs. Our society is a very litigious society and this bill does not provide sufficient religious protections . I aIso do not support this bill and do not believe that we should have a special session for several different reasons. The govenor should not be calling a special session for a bill that did not receive a single hearing during regular session. This bi ll was ignored during regular session but now we are having a special session that will cost tax payers thousand of dollars?! The govenor should also not have been conrtibuting to the writing bills because it is outside of his branch of government. The leg islative branch writes and passes bills, the executive branch enforces laws, and the judicary branch interprets laws. The special session is limited to the least amount of days to hear the least amount of people.There will be no hearings held on the neighb or islands even though this bill will affect them too. Testimonies will be limited to two minutes per a person. Lastly, the bill wasn't released until five days before the special session starts. An entire section on religious exemptions that was completed replaced, leaving the public less than a week to analyze the bill. This bill will affect so many individuals, religious organizations and their affilitates, businesses, non profits, education, and so forth. ONE WEEK ISTOO SHORT to even begin to understan d and anaylyze the bill. feel like the legislators are shoving this bill through the special session without any regard for the people that voted them into office. This bill does not represent the will o the people and will negatively impact Hawaii. Again, I am in strong opposition to SB 1 and urge you to vote NO to this .

It denies business owners their First Amendment right of freedom of religion. It fails to protect bishops, priests and other clergy members from lawsuits. It fails to protect churches, religious groups and temples from lawsuits. It fails to protect church -affiliated organizations (universities, hospitals, adoption agencies, housing agencies, etc.) from lawsuits. The bill extends parentage rights that would transfer N ative Hawaiian ethnicity to non- Native Hawaiian individuals. It provides that same- sex couples married in the State, but who do not live in Hawaii, the right to return to Hawaii courts for divorce, annulment and separation proceedings. Hawaii taxpayers will be paying for these costs , when our state is already in deficit already . It will introduce new educational curriculum for K -12 grades that will present same- sex marriages and relationships to school children and youth. Lastly, i t is in utter opposition to the will of Hawaii voters who voted in 1998 to define marriage exclusively between a man and women in the Hawaii constitution. More than 250,000 Hawaii voters expressed their resolute position on the definition of mar riage as exclusively between a man and women. The language \"reserve marriage\" indicates that the people of Hawaii recognize that the institute of marriage deserves and demands special consideration and criteria, one man and one woman exclusively. I urge y ou to vote NO on S.B. 1. Thank you for your time and leadership.

Au SENATE COMMITTEE ON JUDICIARY AND LABOR Monday, October 28, 2013, 10:30 a.m., Capitol Auditorium Aloha Chair, Vice -Chair, and Members of the Committee. Thank you for the opportunity to testify. I strongly oppose the passage of S.B. 1. I am Mark Au, and was born and raised in Hawaii and currently live in Kailua. I am opposed for the following reasons: 1) Legally: Our Hawaii State Supreme Court in the case of Baehr (later Miike) v. Lewin (1993) held that a right to same -sex marriage would not violate the fundamentals principles of liberty and justice . Moreover, in 1998, the \"marriage amendment\" in the State Constitution, Article 1, Section 23 was ratified by over 70% of the voters giving the legislature the power to reserve marriage to opposite couples. This did not empower the legislature to offer marriage to same - sex couples as in this proposed legislation. If so, this would require a further amendment to the marriage am endment, i.e. let the people vote and decide through in another referendum. 2) Violate s the rights of parents to educate their children: In areas where same -sex marriage laws have passed , Massachusetts, and Ontario, Canada, the courts have dismissed lawsu its of those parent s opposed to having their children forced to be taught that the teaching of homosexuality relationships are identical to heterosexual ones and part of human sexuality. The courts have even prohibited parents from \"opting out\" of these teachings of the normalization of homosexuality with a \"take it or leave it' attitude. I am convinced that th ese same actions will take place in Hawaii if this law is passed. 3) Society' s values: This redefines marriage and will have a devasting impact o n society for generations. Marriage is the union of a man and woman. I oppose legislation conferring legal status on any other type of sexual relationship. Your role is to help our children have a mother and a father in a child's life. Affirming marriag e serves this purpose. If you follow the logic, if marriage is not exclusive to opposite sex couples and includes same -sex couples, and not limited based on the sex of one's partner, then why limit marriage to a couple? 4) Freedom of conscience and religious freedom violated: Religious and persons of conscience who share their views regarding same -sex unions will be threatened to speak out if this law is passed because same -sex unions , and therefore, homosexual behavior and relationships are to be accepte d and \"normalized\" and viewed as the same as traditional marriage. Proponents would apply or pass \"hates crimes\" legislation to muzzle and prevent priests, pastors, and religious leaders from speaking freely about the prohibition of homosexual lifestyle. Already in Massachusetts, justices of the peac e who refused to preside over same -sex marriages due to moral or religious objections were fired. In Canada, those speaking freely against this behavior and relationships have been challenged as \"hate crimes\" . Hawaii would soon follow with this type of action against persons of faith and conscience. I am convinced, based on past proponent strategies, any proposed religious exemptions in this bill would soon be repealed. 5) Negative impact on our b usinesses : Businesses who refuse to provide service to a same- sex couple based on religious beliefs and conscience will be sued and taken to court. In Albuquerque , New Mexico a wedding photographer was held liable under the state's anti - discrimination laws for refusin g to photograph a same -sex couple commitment ceremony. While New Mexico doesn't have same- sex marriage, the courts are treating homosexuality like race for purposes of non -discrimination. Even same -sex marriage supporters opposed this ruling. If this law is passed, this same situation will occur because of the law. 6) Past results: Results from other States indicate that in most cases, same- sex marriage is not the true intent of advocates. Research shows that not a large number of same -sex couples want to marry. In Hawaii, the Legislature passed laws to provide marriage rights and benefits - including the reciprocal beneficiaries act, followed by domestic partnerships and most recently, civil unions - with advocates promising the public that these laws will satisfy their request for equality and will not lead to same -sex marriage. Same -sex marriage advocates ' strategy here and across the country in the past, now and the future is not truly marriage, rather it is about legalizing the approval on homosexuality and imposing it with force throughout the various social and political inst itutions of a society that would never accept it otherwise. In conclusion, I urge you to vote no on to SB. 1 because an unjust law isn't a law at all. Testimony Regarding the Marriage Equality Act Milton Nodacker and Jean Nodacker of Pahoa, Hawaii , submit the following in testimony on the Marriage Equality Act: In reviewing the proposed Marriage Equality Act it is evident that the so -called protections for religious organizations and persons are completely inadequate. They were either included as mere \"see, we protected your interests\" eyewash or drafted with the intent of maximizing litigation and strife over the issue in the state of Hawaii. The p roposed legislation should be carefully redrafted and considered, not crammed through in a special session. The legislature and governor are responding to a very small, but highly vocal and well financed minority attempting to bludgeon the rest of the po pulation into accepting their chosen lifestyle as normal. Enactment of this bill will give these activists a weapon which they will use to attack persons and organizations of religious conviction and destroy lives and small businesses. An analysis of the bill by seven professors from five US law schools in a letter to Senator Rosalyn H. Baker finds it completely inadequate in protections for religious objection. In addition to protection for religious institution, the y recommend the following amendments to protect persons of religious conviction: (b) Individuals and small businesses protected. (1) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2), no individual, sole proprietor, or small business shall be required to (A) provide goods or services that assist or prom ote the solemnization or celebration of any marriage, or provide counseling or other services that directly facilitate the perpetuation of any marriage; or (B) provide benefits to any spouse of an employee; or (C) provide housing to any married couple if providing such goods, services, benefits, or housing would cause such individuals or sole proprietors, or owners of such small businesses, to violate their sincerely held religious beliefs. (2) Paragraph (b)(1) shall not apply if (A) a party to the marriage is unable to obtain any similar good or services, employment benefits, or housing elsewhere without substantial hardship; or (B) in the case of an individual who is a government employee or official, if another government employee or official is not promptly available and willing to provide the requested government service without inconvenience or delay; provided that no judicial officer authorized to solemnize marriages shall be required to solemnize any marriage if to do so would violate the judicial o fficer's sincerely held religious beliefs. (3) A \"small business\" within the meaning of paragraph (b)(1) is a legal entity other than a natural person (A) that provides services which are primarily performed by an owner of the business; or (B) that has fi ve or fewer employees; or (C) in the case of a legal entity that offers housing for rent, that owns five or fewer units of housing. (c) No civil cause of action or other penalties. No refusal to provide services, accommodations, advantages, facilities, go ods, or privileges protected by this section shall (1) result in a civil claim or cause of action challenging such refusal; or (2) result in any action by the State or any of its subdivisions to penalize or withhold benefits from any protected entity or individual, under any laws of this State or its subdivisions, including but not limited to laws regarding employment discrimination, housing, public accommodations, educational institutions, licensing, government contracts or grants, or tax -exempt status.7 * * * * * Some have expressed concern that the proposed text would permit objections to interracial marriage. Although such objections are likely to be rare, if not non- existent, this concern is readily addressed by a simple proviso that would read: \"Notwi thstanding any of the foregoing provisions, this section does not change any provision of law with respect to discrimination on the basis of race.\" This proposed amendment has several important benefits. First, this text parallels existing protections in H awaii's nondiscrimination laws for a \"religious or denominational institution or organization, or any organization operated for charitable or educational purposes, that is operated, supervised or controlled by or in connection with a religious organization.\" The text also significantly mirrors, in part, the express protections provided in the Connecticut, Delaware, District of Columbia, Maryland, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington same -sex marriage laws for religious organizations. Many of these laws protect, among other things, the conscientious refusal \"to provide services, accommodations, advantages, facilities, goods, or privileges . . . related to the solemnization of a marriage.\" These seven legal scholars conclude their analysis and recommendations as follows: Once the bill is passed, those opposed to any exceptions for religious communities will give the narrowest possible interpretation to all exemptions. For this reason, the legislature ought to take enough time to write legislation consonant with President Obama's sage counsel: \"On an issue as sensitive as this, knowing that Americans hold a wide range of views based on deeply held beliefs, maintaining our nation's commitment to religious freedom is al so vital.\" To clarify the sort of legal protection that should surround religious life in this country, and to foster and address a whole range of developing conflicts, further reflection on refining this legislation is imperative. The proposed bill in Hawaii to legalize same -sex marriage provides considerably less protection than most every other jurisdiction where the legislature has considered the issue. Connecticut, the District of Columbia, Maryland, Minnesota New Hampshire, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington have all enacted same -sex marriage laws, and all provide much more protection for religious liberty than Hawaii's proposed legislation. Each of those states protects religious organizations from being forced to offer \"services, accommodations, advantages, facilities, goods, or privileges\" related to a marriage when doing so would violate their religious beliefs. Although the protections in Connecticut, the District of Columbia, Maryland, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington also fall short in key areas, they still provide far more protection than Hawaii's proposed same sex marriage legislation. Without adequate safeguards for religious liberty of the sort proposed in this letter, the r ecognition of same- sex marriage will lead to socially divisive and entirely unnecessary conflicts between the exercise of rightspursuant to the same -sex marriage law and religious liberty. That is a destructive path leading to needless loss by both sides. A balanced \"middle way\" leads to a win -win solution for both sides. The Hawaii State Legislature should avoid either extreme and be the wise peacemaker. [All emphasis in original.] We urge you to support the recommended amendments to the bill to protect those citizens and organizations who conscientiously object to participation in solemnization of same sex marriages. If these amendments can not be made, we urge you to vote to table the measure until it can be rewritten or to vote for its defeat. We would be happy to provide the entire letter and its recommendations at your request. Sincerely, /s/ Milton Nodacker Jean Nodacker nodacker@gmail.com Senate Committee on Judiciary and Labor Testimony for SB1 Relating to Equal Rights I am opposed to SB1 because m arriage is one of the most important institutions of society. It is a commitment that demonstrates how one should relate to and respect one another. Where children are born and nurtured and t aught values and morals and to also to respect one another. However, if you change the definition of marriage to become something other than the joining of one man and one woman, dire consequences will occ ur. Number 1: Marriage will no longer be seen as necessary. In Massachusetts where same sex marriage was first legalized, only 52% of same sex couples even bothered to marry. In the Netherlands , the same sex marriage rate is only 12%. This sends a message that marriage is optional and not the norm, thus fewer people will decide to marry. Number 2: More children will be born out of wedlock. Most same sex marriage couples do not marry with the intention of having children. A good, well thought out law brings well being and life to the state but a poorly written, law which is hastily voted on brings oppression to its people and even worse left open for interpretation. In a society which is already having trouble maintaining stability in marriage and family life, this could be disastrous. Allowing same sex marriage would introduce more uncertainty and instability to our state. I thought the state and its laws were supposed to protect families? Please do not allow SB1 to pass in its present condition but allow the public to vote on this very important decision.

This Bill does not doenough to preserve so many of our rights and freedoms. The issue of same sexedmarriage is complex. The state has already voted on this issue and had decided thatmarriage was between a man and a woman. You are distorting the intentions of thevote that was taken by the citizens of this state and abusing your power. If you wantto make changes, why not allow the people to vote on an issue that is so divisive. Ibelieve that it goes against all we stand for as a DEMOCRACY. Please vote NO!

I concern over the physical, mental and emotional problems that will beset those who choose the homosexual lifestyle, and I object to what this wi ll do to our community, my children and to my traditional family life. Evidence clearly show that children must be raised in a traditional family environment to thrive and to grow. In addition, legalizing Same Sex Marriage will have a negative effect on the liberties of religious freedom, as it relates to what the Bible holds as God's Truth and Christians' freedom to teach from it. Government should never define moral value and limit the teachings of faith group. Legalizing Same Sex Marriage will put a threat to religious freedom. Therefore, please vote NO on any piece of the Same Sex Marriage bill! Aloha Senators and Representatives, I am strong oppose to Senate Bill 1 and I feel that the religious exemptions are not adequate to protect individuals, religious organizations, and their affiliates. While I believed in equal rights, there is nothing equal about this bill. Same sex couples already receive all of their state benefits through the Civil Union Law and have access to their federal benefits through the recent Supreme Court ruling. Meanwhile, this bill will negatively impact individuals religio us organizations and their affiliates. Just because the public accommodation section was deleted from the final version of the bill, it does not mean that religious organizations and their affiliates are not subject to the public accommodations law. An ent ire state department does not just disappear overnight. Hawaii Civil Rights Commission will still enforce the public accommodations laws and with no protection written into our current bills, many religious organizations and their affiliates will be left v ulnerable.Washington, a very liberal state, has explicitly stated in their laws that even if a religious organization is considered to be a public accommodation they still cannot be sued. In addition, this bill violates our First Amendment rights, the fre edom of religion As a basic constitutional right, everyone should have the right to believe and practice what they believe in. They should not be forced to participate in anything goes against their religious beliefs. Our society is a very litigious socie ty and this bill does not provide sufficient religious protections. I also do not support this bill and do not believe that we should have a special session for several different reasons. The governor should not be calling a special session for a bill th at did not receive a single hearing during regular session. This bill was ignored during regular session but now we are having a special session that will cost tax payers thousand of dollars?! The governor should also not have been contribution to the writing bills because it is outside of his branch of government. The legislative branch writes and passes bills, the executive branch enforces laws, and the judiciary branch interprets laws. The special session is limited to the least amount of days to hear the least amount of people.There will be no hearings held on the neighbor islands even though this bill will affect them too. Testimonies will be limited to two minutes per a person. Lastly, the bill wasn't released until five days before the special session starts. An entire section on religious exemptions that was completed replaced, leaving the public less than a week to analyze the bill. This bill will affect so many individuals, religious organizations and their affiliates, businesses, non profits, education, and so forth. ONE WEEK IS TOO SHORT to even begin to understand and analyze the bill. feel like the legislators are shoving this bill through the special session without any regard for the people that voted them into office. This bill does not repr esent the will o the people and will negatively impact Hawaii. Again, I am in strong opposition to SB 1 and urge you to vote NO to this bill..

Aloha Kakou, Honorable Senators and Representatives of the Hawaii State Legislature. I write to you today in opposition to Special Session Measure SB 1 which will allow same -sex marriages in the State of Hawaii. Abuse of Power We gave you the power to uphold the right to reserve marriage between one man and one woman. We did not give you the power to change it at your will. I am protesting your decision to change the definition of marriage to include those of the same sex. Civilly, any couple of legal age & status can legally join in union. That is the extent of the law, and that is how it should remain. You should not use the citizens of Hawaii as guinea pigs in the experiment of social engineering by allowing those who prefer s ex with the same- sex individuals to marry just so they can receive Federal benefits. As a reminder: Constitutional Amendment 2 of 1998 amended the Constitution of Hawaii, granting the state legislature the power to prevent same -sex marriage from being conducted or recognized in Hawaii . Amendment 2 was the first constitutional amendment adopted in the United States that specifically targeted same -sex partnerships. [1] In 1993, the Hawaii State Supreme Court ruled in Baehr v. Lewin , 852 P.2d 44 (Haw. 1993), that refusing to grant marriage licenses to same -sex couples was discriminatory under that state's constitution. [2] However, the court did not immediately order the state to begin issuing marria ge licenses to same -sex couples; rather, it stayed its ruling and ordered the state to justify its position. This ruling galvanized opposition to same -sex marriage in the state and around the country and led to the adoption of Amendment 2.[citation needed] Amendment 2 differed from amendments that followed in other states in that it did not write a ban on same -sex marriage into the state's constitution; rather, it allowed the state legisla ture to enact such a ban. [3] On November 3, 1998, Hawaii voters approved the amendment by a vote of 69.2-28.6%, [4] and the state legislature exercised its power to ban same- sex marriage. [3] The amendment reads: [5] The legislature shall have the power to reserve marriage to opposite-sex couples. Desire vs. Race - Muta ble vs. Immutable Sexual preference comes the mind, which is stimulated by the senses, and the mind and its desires can - and does - change. It can also be controlled and redirected, whereas race comes from the genes and has nothing to do with the mind; it cannot be controlled or redirected. You can change your mindset; you cannot change your genes. For example, a man may think himself to be Native Hawaiian, but genetically, he's Euro -Asian. No amount of thinking can change that fact. But the same person has choices on how he has sex. He may have very strong desires to have sex with his brother, male best friend, or even his Rottweiler - and is thoroughly convinced that he is a homosexual or otherwise. But in fact, these are desires; they didn't spring from genetics - they spring from the mind: he wants to enjoy sex in a particular way - and those desires are mutable. Your treating sexual preference as the same as being Native Hawaiian is disingenuous, at best. Sexual preference is not a Civil Right, nor is marriage between any consenting adult - and that is the way it should stay. Same -sex \"Marriage\" is not a Civi Right II have attached a file to this article, which, given the time- frame, you may not have the time to read - but if you get around to it, it may help you understand a different aspect in this all- important decision. If the file attachment doesn't work, here is the link: http://www.cpjustice.org/stories/storyReader$1178 Doing What is Pono So, basing laws upon a small group of people who have sex with the same sex is unintelligent and is unworthy of your position as our elected State leaders. We elected you; we can un- elect you if you misuse our trust. (See: Mufi Hannemann, Linda Lingle) You need to see the big picture here, and not get caught up in the fervent emotion surrounding this issue. Doing what is Pono for all, including those who wish to have sex with the same sex, means you stay out of the \"marriage\" business, stop the forced social engineering and vote NO on so- called \"marriage equality .\" Mahalo Nui Loa & Ke Akua Ho'omaika'i Oe, J.

Do not reply to this email. This inbox is not monitored. For assistance please email webmaster@capitol.hawaii.govDear Honorable Representative s, According to the Ms. Juliet Joslin vs New Zealand case, the United Nation human rights committee , which was formed by 18 Human Right experts, stated clearly that same -sex marriage is NOT civil right. The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights , article 23, paragraph 2 stated clearly that marriage is between men and women. \"The right of men and women of marriageable age to marry and to found a family shall be recognized.\" However, the people of New Zealand legalized same -sex marriage several months ago . But it passed 3 readings and took almost a year for the entire legalization process . Even though same - sex marriage is not civil right, it is recognized by the people of New Zealand. We have a different political system in the United States but let me ask these: 1. What is marriage? And who can answer this? The people! A 5-day special session is not enough to collect the voice of the people on marriage . Please do not compromise democracy for what you believe \"good \" reason . If so, a s an immigrant from China, I can share with you that this is what we called - dictator ship. A 'Yes' vote during special session is a ' No' vote to democracy . Please , kill the bill during this special session. Thank you.

The Governor would have us believe that s upporting his Socio Legal Experiment, Same-Sex Marriage, through a craftily worded administrativ e change in the law has legal benefits that outweigh the sociological impact of Same-Sex Marriage. According to recent State of Hawai'i, Department of Health statistics there were 916 Civil Unions consummated since they have been available co mpared to 32,513 Marriages between a man and a woman during that same period. Why are you considering a bill in a special session to address just 3% of State licensed unions? If you pass this bill, you are forcing your constituents to be a part of the Governor's Socio Legal Experiment. There are other states and a few count ries who have decided to try this irreversible experiment. It is irreversible because once yo u grant someone legal privileges you cannot take those privileges away, like Civil Unions. What has the experience of these states and countries been? Massachusetts was the first State to enac t Same-Sex Marriage in 2003 what are the consequences both intended and unintended in that State? All public school libraries are expanding their bookshelves with books to normali ze the Same-Sex partner behavior and life style. Canada acknowledged Same-Sex Marriage beginning in 2003. Besides Canadian schools teaching that there are now six genders, what were the intended and unintended consequences? I urge you to vote \"No\" on this bill in this Speci al Session, to allow these questions to be vetted by a broader base of your constituents and understa nd the long-term effects of this bill. Same- Sex Marriage has not been in place anywhere long enough to assess the generational impact on our children, families and society. Is this the legacy you want to leave as a legislator? Thank you, Alan Yamashiro - 2 - Even Massachusetts recognized same-sex marriage test . . . http://www.bostonglobe.com/news/nation/201 3/06/26/roots-supreme-court-decision- overturning-doma-are-massachusetts /G31gFFEZbXLvgI0IWnFojO/story.html Providing a test case for gay marriage was, in retrospect, an essential part of a longer-term strategy. \"As long as there was no marriage then the argumen t that same-sex marriage wasn't going to cause problems couldn't be refuted,\" said Barney Frank, who was the first openly gay congressman. \"It gave us a basis to use some ev idence, and show that the notion that this was going to hurt society was totally baseless.\" What are the facts concerning trad itional Persons in civil unions account for less than 1/ 5 of 1% of the total population in Hawaii.

The Federal Supreme court refused to acknowledge the legal standing of California's Proposition 8. \"Proposition 8 passed with 52 percent of the vote, halting gay marriage in California. Two gay couples then sued in federal court to overturn the ban. State officials refused to defend the law, and a federal judge allowed its original propone nts \u2014 again, the people who put it on the ballot \u2014 to step in.\" http://nbcpolitics.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/06/2 6/19155307-prop-8-ruling- explained-why-gay- marriage-will-resume-in-california The Supreme Court ruling on a California la w known as Proposition 8 came down to a legal technicality but has huge practical effect \u2014 rest oring gay marriage in the nation's most populous state. The court ruled that proponents of Propositi on 8, a ban on gay marriage passed by California voters in 2008, did not have the legal right to defend the law in the federal courts. Chief Justice John Roberts, writing for the court, said that the proponents \u2014 the people who put Proposition 8 on the ballot \u2014 had no \"personal stake\" in defending it, at least no more than other ordinary citizens of California. At issue was a legal standard known as standing \u2014 the standard that keeps just anyone from suing about just anyt hing in the federal courts. To have a case, the standard says, you have to show harm. How will this Bill be enforced? The Hawaii Civil Right Commission (HCRC) has been tasked with enforcement. Their legal position is very narrow and in support of Same-Sex Marriage. The HCRC is a State funded branch of the Department of Labor and I ndustrial Relations. Any individual may bring a complaint to the HCRC who would consider the complaint and bring suit on behalf of the plaintiff if deemed to be a violation. The de fendant would be responsib le for their own legal defense. http://labor.hawaii.gov/hcrc/hcrc-news/hcrc-res ponse-regarding-marriage-equality-religious- organizations-and-facilities-a nd-public-accommodations-law/ \"The Hawai i Civil Rights Commission supports the proposed marriage equality legislation, as offered in the draft bill posted by Governor Abercrombie, dated 9/9/13, including the proposed HRS \u00a7\u00a7 572-F and 572-G religious exemptions for clergy who refuse to solemnize marriages and for religious organization that re fuse to make religious facilities available for solemnization of a marriage, if the religious f acility is not a place of public accommodation. The HCRC will oppose proposals to create religious ex emptions that diminish protections against discrimination under our state public accommodations law. Example 2 A religious organization owns a facility that it uses fo r religious purposes. It allows the rental of the facility for weddings for a fee, with a large num ber of international vis itors paying to have their weddings at the site without regard to th eir religion. The religious organization wonders whether it may decline to rent the facility to same-sex couples for weddings. Two-part inquiry: 1) Is this a place of public accommodation? Yes, the religious organization offers the use of its facility to the public as customers, clients, or vi sitors. This is a fact-based, case by case threshold determination. - 4 - 2) Is there prohibited discrimination? Yes. The religious organization offers its facility for rent to the public for weddings, and does not require the couples getting married in the facility to be members or followers of the religious denomination. Discriminatory denial of use of the facility on the basis of sexual orientation is proh ibited under the public accommodations law.\" What is the experience in Massachusetts? Same-sex marriage in Massachusetts began on May 17, 2004, as a result of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court (SJC) ruling in Goodridge v. Department of Public Health that it was unconstitutional under the Massachusetts constitution to allow only opposite-sex couples to marry. Massachusetts became the sixth jurisdiction in the world (after the Netherlands , Belgium , Ontario , British Columbia , and Quebec ) to legalize same-sex marriage . It was the first U.S. state to issue marriage license s to same-sex couples.[1] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam e-sex_marriage_in_Massachusetts Background In 1989, passing legislation first proposed in 19 73, Massachusetts prohibited discrimination based on sexual orientation in credit, public and pr ivate employment, union practices, housing, and public accommodation.[2] In the decade that followed, po litical debate addressed same-sex relationships through two proxy issues: spousal benefits and parenting rights. Boston's City Council debated health insurance for the same- sex partners of city employees in May 1991[3] and Cambridge provided health benefits to the sa me-sex partners of its employees the following year.[4] In 1992, Governor Bill Weld issued an ex ecutive order providing limited benefits for the same-sex partners of approximately 3,000 ma nagement-level state employees, covering only leave for family sickness and bereavement, far shor t of the health benefits LGBT activists were seeking, but probably the first state-level recognition of same-sex relationships.[5] The Roman Catholic bishops of Massachusetts, replying in The Pilot , the newspaper of the Boston Archdiocese , said that Weld's \"domestic partners\" decision harms the common good \"by making a special interest group equal to the family\" and confuses \"civil rights and family benefits\". They asked: \"Why should special recognition and assistan ce be given to friends who happen to share the same house?\"[6] Legislation to establish domestic part nerships that would carry spousal benefits was introduced annually in the state legi slature without success. Its supporters focused on equal benefits and fairness rather th an same-sex relationships themselves.[7] In 1998, when the legislature passed a home rule petition allowing Boston to create such a status, Governor Paul Cellucci vetoed it because it applied to different- sex couples, which he thought undermined marriage, while he offered to sign legislation that applied to same-sex couples only. Boston Mayor Thomas Menino 's attempt to extend health care benefits to city employees' domestic partners by executive order instead.[8] was successfully challenged by the Catholic Action League in court.[9] The state had no explicit regulations with respect to foster care and parenting by gays and lesbians, either singly or in relationships, until, on May 24, 1985, the state Department of Social Services, with the approval of Governor Michael Dukakis , created a rule that foster children be placed in \"traditional family settings\".[10] In December 1986, a commission that reviewed the foster care system recommended that sexual orient ation could not be used to disqualify foster parents.[11] As Dukakis delayed accepting that recommendations, advocates for gay and lesbian rights threatened protests against his presidential campaign.[12] The ban on gay foster parents was enacted into law in the 1989 budget.[13] After a lawsuit challenging the ban was settled out of court, the Dukakis administration withdrew the policy in April 1990.[14] In the 1990s, court decisions further expanded the parenting rights of gays and lesbians. In September 1993, the state's highest court ruled that state law allowe d for second-parent adoption by a parent of the - 5 - same sex as a biological parent.[15] In July 1999, the same court awarded visitation rights to each of two mothers after their separation.[16] Same-sex marriage itself was rarely mentione d or address directly during these years. The Coalition for Lesbian and Gay Civil Rights launche d a campaign on behalf of marriage rights for same-sex couples in Massachusetts in 1991. Governor Bill Weld said he would be willing to meet with the group and said he was undecided on the question.[17] When asked about \"gay marriage\" while running to represent Massachusetts in the U.S. Senate in 1994, Mitt Romney said: \"it is not appropriate at this time\".[18] In December 1996, considering the possibility of Hawaii legalizing same-sex marriage, Weld said that Massachuse tts would recognize the validity of same-sex marriages licensed there. He called the Defense of Marriage Act unconstitutional.[19] In neighboring Vermont, activists mounted a legal challenge to that state's denial of marriage licenses to same-sex couples. The lawsuit, Baker v. Vermont , was launched on July 22, 1997.[20] The decision on December 20, 1999,[21] launched a four-month debate as the legislature considered how to meet the court's requirement that same-sex couples ha ve access to the rights and privileges of marriage. The end result was th e passage of legislation establishing civil unions as an alternative to marriage.[22] Governor Howard Dean signed the legislation on April 26[23] and it took effect on July 1.[24] Protection of Marriage Amendment In December 1998, state Representative John H. Rogers , a Democrat, proposed legislation to prevent Massachusetts from granting legal r ecognition to same-sex marriages established elsewhere: \"a purported marriage contracted between persons of the same sex shall be neither valid nor recognized in the Commonwealth.\"[25] In 1999, the Lesbian and Gay Political Alliance of Massachusetts called it a \"hate bill\" and a coa lition of more than 150 religious leaders formed the Religious Coalition for the Freedom to Marry to oppose it.[26] Others religious leaders organized in support of the measure.[25] Rogers revised his proposal to define marriage as the union of a man and a woman when he offered it again in 2001, with the additional provision that \"Any other relationship shall not be recognized as a marriage, or its legal equivalent, or receive the benefits exclusive to marriage in the Co mmonwealth.\" The chair of the Lesbian and Gay Political Alliance of Massachusetts said its prosp ects for passage were slim but it could serve as a countervailing proposal to efforts at establishing ci vil unions or providing benefits to same-sex partners of state and local government employees. [27][28] Alongside these legislative maneuvers, GLAD filed a lawsuit in state court challenging th e denial of marriage rights to same-sex couples in April 2001.[29] In July 2001, Massachusetts Citizens for Ma rriage announced a campaign to amend the state constitution with language sim ilar to Rogers' legislation,[30] called the \"Protection of Marriage Amendment\".[31] Some signature gatherers complained that opponents of the amendment were harassing them and their opponents charged in turn that some signature gatherers were misrepresenting the petition's content.[32][33] A sufficient number of signatures were certified in December.[34] The President of the Massachusetts Senate cont rols the calling of a c onstitutional convention and its agenda.[35] Senate President Tom Birmingham , an opponent of the amendment, called a joint meeting of the legislature as a constitutional convention for June 19, 2002, and immediately adjourned it for a month saying legislators need ed for time to consider the agenda items.[36] When the constitutional convention met again on July 17, the amendment's opponents knew that - 6 - proponents had the 50 votes needed for passage. Birmingham, who was presiding, moved for adjournment without considering the amendment, and his motion passed 137 to 53. He called the amendment \"wrong-hearted and wrong-headed \" and defended the procedure: \"Everybody recognizes a vote to adjourn was a vote up or down\" on the amendment. \"I did gavel the last constitutional convention to a recess because I fe lt the members needed more time to assess.... Today we saw democracy in action. They may not like it, but they lost two to one.\" A representative of the Catholic Action League, wh ich supported the amendment, said: \"Everything that is wrong with Massachusetts state government was apparent today for all the world to see\". One legislator who voted to adjourn said: \"For those of us who believe in an open democratic process, this was not a comfortable vote\". State Senator Cheryl A. Jacques , an opponent of the amendment and a lesbian, said: \"I'm proud to have done anything possible to defeat this hate- filled, discriminatory measure. I'll take a victory on this any way I can get it.\"[37] Arlene Isaacson of the Massachusetts Gay and Lesbian Political Ca ucus later explained it was a critical moment because same-sex marriage had no chance of winning a popular vote at the time: \"Not that we would lose by a little, because that wasn't an issu e. Rather, it was that we were going to get massacred\".[38] In April 2003, a committee of the legislature held a hearing on the constitutional amendment,[39] but took no action.[40] The four Roman Catholic bishops of Massachusetts, long distracted by the revelations of the sexual abuse of minors by pri ests, did not address the issue until late May, when they ordered pastors to read and publish a statement to mobilize their parishioners to contact their legislators to urge then to support the constitutional amendment.[41] On June 10, the Court of Appeal for Ontario decided Halpern v. Canada , making same-sex marriage immediately legal in that province .[42] Goodridge v. Department of Public Health [edit] Main article: Goodridge v. Department of Public Health Seven same-sex couples represented by Gay & Lesbian Advocates and Defenders initiated a lawsuit in state court, Goodridge v. Department of Public Health , on April 11, 2001. The plaintiffs argued that denying same-sex couples equal marriage rights was unconstitutional under the state constitution. On May 7, 2002, Suffolk County Superior Court Judge Thomas E. Connolly ruled that the state marriage statute was not gender-neutral, no fundamental right to same-sex marriage existed, and that limiti ng marriage to male-female couples was rational because \"procreation is marriage's central purpose\".[43] He concluded his legal analysis by saying that the issue should be handled by the legislature.[1] The plaintiffs appealed directly to the Supreme Judicial Court (SJC), which heard arguments on March 4, 2003. Mary Bonauto of GLAD argued the case for the plaintiffs. Assistant Attorney General Judith Yogman represented the DPH.[44] On November 18, 2003, the SJC ruled 4 to 3 that the state's ban on same-sex marriage was unc onstitutional. The court said: \"We declare that barring an individual from the protections, benef its, and obligations of civil marriage solely because that person would marry a person of the same sex violates the Massachusetts Constitution.\" It provided a definition of marri age that would meet the state constitution's requirements: \"We construe civil marriage to mean the voluntary union of two persons as spouses, to the exclusion of all others.\" The court stayed its ruling for 180 days to allow the state legislature \"take such action as it may deem appropriate in light of this opinion.\" [1] - 7 - Governor Mitt Romney said he disagreed with the SJC's decision, but \"We obviously have to follow the law as provided by the Supreme Judicial Court, even if we don't agree with it\". He said he would work with the legislature to draft a law \"consistent\" with the ruling. He also backed an amendment to the state constitution to define ma rriage as the union of a man and a woman while also providing by statute \"basic civil rights and appropriate benefits to same-sex couples and other nontraditional relationships.\" [45] Romney quickly joined legislators in attempting to satisfy the Goodridge decision by creating civil unions for same-sex couples.[46] His views were recognized as an attempt to establish his record on a controversial issue while planning to run for the Republican nomination for president.[47] Former Governor Weld took credit for laying the groundwork for the decision: \"A lot of the stuff we did foreshadowed the opinion.\" He said: \"It is a thunderbolt, but a thunderbolt correctly heard.\"[48] Opponents of gay and lesbian rights opposed any compromise with the SJC. Brian Camenker, head of the Parents Rights Coalition, said: \"As Martin Luther King pointed out in his letter from the Birmingham jail, there are some laws that are so unnatural that you have an obligation to openly defy them. The concept of stable, healthy gay relationships is largely a manufacturing of the gay propaganda machine.\" He called the deci sion \"complete lunacy\" and said: \"It's beyond shocking. It's madness. It's four judges basically turning society inside out with no input from anybody else.\" [49] The public schools in Massachusetts The homosexual \"marriage\" onslaught in public schools across the state started soon after the November 2003 court ruling. 2004 - By the following year it was in elementary school curricula - with hostility toward parents who disagreed. Kindergartners in Lexington, Mass. were given copies of a picture book, Who's in a Family?, telling them that same-sex couples are just another kind of family, just like their own parents. When David Parker - parent of a kindergartner - calmly refused to leave a school meeting unless officials agreed to notify him wh en discussing homosexuality or transgenderism with his son, the school had him arrested and jailed overnight. 2005 - The next year, second graders at the same school were read a book, King and King, about two men who fall in love and marry each other, ending with a picture of them kissing. When parents Robb and Robin Wirthlin co mplained, they were told that the school had no obligation to notify them or allow them to opt their child out. In 2006 a cross-dressing man undergoi ng a sex-change operation was brought into a third-grade class in Newton to teach the children that there are now \"different kinds of families.\" School officials told a mother that her complaints to the principal were considered \"inappropriate behavior\"! She ended up removing her child from the school. In 2007 a federal judge ruled that because of \"gay marriage\" in Massachusetts, parents have no rights regarding the teaching of homosexual rela tionships in schools. The previous year the Parkers and Wirthlins had filed a federal civil ri ghts lawsuit to force the schools to notify parents and allow them to opt out their elementary sch ool children when homosexual-related subjects were taught. The federal judge dismissed the case. The appeals judges later upheld the first judge's ruling that because same-sex marriage is legal in Massachusetts, the school actually had a duty to normalize homosexual relationships to chil dren; and schools have no obligation to notify parents or let them opt out their children. A cceptance of homosexuality had become a matter of good citizenship! - 8 - School libraries have also radically changed. Sc hool libraries across the state, from elementary school to high school, now have expanding shelv es of books to normalize homosexual behavior and \"lifestyle\" in the minds of kids, some of th em quite explicit and even pornographic. Parents' complaints are ignored or met with hostility. \"Gay days\" in schools are considered necessar y to fight \"intolerance\" against same sex relationships. Hundreds of high schools and even middle schools across the state now hold \"gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender days.\" In my own town, a school committee member announced that combating \"homophobia\" was now a top priority. The schools not only \"celebrate\" homosexual marriage, but have move d beyond to promote other behaviors such as cross-dressing and transsexuality. Public Health in Massachusetts In recent years state funding for HIV/AIDS programs has gone up considerably in Massachusetts, along with the proportion of homosexual-related ca ses. According to the Massachusetts Dept. of Public Health, even though the total number of new HIV/AIDS diagnoses has declined, the proportion caused by male homosexual behavior rose by over 30% from 2000-2009. Thus, for the last several years the state has budgeted $30-$35 million per year for these programs. A hideously obscene booklet on \"gay\" practices crea ted by health officials was given out in a high school. Citing \"the right to marry\" as one of the \"important challenges\" in a place where \"it's a great time to be gay,\" the Mass. Dept. of Public Health helped the AIDS Action Committee produce The Little Black Book: Queer in the 21st Century. It was given to teens at Brookline High School on April 30, 2005. Among other things, it gives \"tips\" to boys on how to perform oral sex on other males, masturbate other mal es, and how to \"safely\" have someone urinate on you for sexual pleasure. It even included a directory of bars in Boston where young men meet for anonymous sex. Hospitals in Massachusetts A major Boston hospital threatened to fire a ph ysician when he objected to its promotion of homosexual behavior. In 2011 a prominent physicia n at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston - a large Harvard-affiliated hospital - object ed to the hospital being involved with \"Gay Pride\" activities. He also pointed out to his supe riors the medical health risks of homosexuality, and said that he and others at the hospital c onsidered homosexual acts to be unnatural and immoral. The hospital then threatened to fire hi m, telling him that same-sex marriage is \"legal\" and that his comments constituted \"harassment a nd discrimination.\" After a \"hearing\" he was allowed to keep his job, but was told to apol ogize and to keep his opinions on these matters to himself. Domestic Violence in Massachusetts \"Gay domestic partner violence\" literature (funded by the state) is now distributed at virtually every public homosexual event - including to children at \"Youth Pride\" events, GLSEN conferences, \"gay straight alliance\" high school cl ubs - and especially at the various events and parades during \"Gay Pride\" week. Business and Employment in Massachusetts People can now get fired from their jobs for expressing religious objections to same-sex \"marriage.\" In 2009, a deputy manager at a Brookstone store in Boston was fired from his job for mentioning his belief to another manager who had kept bringing up the subject with him that day. Brookstone's letter of termin ation (quoted on local TV news) said his comment was \"inappropriate\" because \"in the State of M assachusetts, same-sex marriage is legal.\" - 9 - The wedding industry is required to serve the homosexual community if requested. Wedding photographers, halls, caterers, etc., must accept same -sex marriage events or be held liable for discrimination. Businesses are often \"tested\" for tolerance by homosexual activists. Groups of homosexual activists go into restaurants or bars and publicly kiss and fondle each other to test whether the establishment demonstrates sufficient \"equality\" \u2014 now that homosexual marriage is \"legal.\" Then they report \"tolerance violators\" to author ities, and businesses can be fined and punished. In fact, more and more overt displays of homosexual affection are seen in public places across the state to reinforce \"marriage equality.\" Legal profession and judicial system in Massachusetts In 2011 the Governor appointed Barbara Lenk, a \"m arried\" lesbian activist, to be a state Supreme Court Justice. She has said that the interp retation of law \"evolves and develops\" because \"minority groups [e.g., homosexuals] see certa in things differently based on their own experiences.\" Adoption and birth certificates in Massachusetts In the year after the \"gay marriage\" ruling, th e state's adoption and foster care workers went through a massive indoctrination on \"LGBT youth awareness.\" This included employees and managers at the Mass. Dept. of Social Services. These sessions were run by the radical National Gay and Lesbian Task Force (which once awarded a \"Leather Leadership Award\" to the owner of a pornographic video company). The emphasis was that those working with children must be trained that homosexuality (and transgenderism) are normal. At one session, the trainer announced that the new motto is, \"To tolerate is an assault; you have to accept\" this behavior. Homosexual \"married\" couples can now demand to be allowed to adopt children - through any agency. In 2006 Catholic Charities decided to abandon handling adoptions rather submit to regulations requiring them to allow homose xuals to adopt the children in their care. In 2006 the Massachusetts Department of Soci al Services (DSS) honored two men \"married\" to each other as their \"Parents of th e Year.\" The men had adopted a baby through DSS (against the wishes of the baby's birth parents). According to news reports, the day after that adoption was final, DSS approached the men about adopting a second child. A court ruled in 2012 that if a child is \"bor n of a same-sex marriage,\" there is no need for adoption by a non-biological parent. Thus, they would both be the listed as the \"parents\" on the child's birth certificate, without any formal proceedings necessary. (The other biological parent is not noted on the official birth certificate.) Government mandates in Massachusetts In 2004, Governor Mitt Romney ordered Justices of the Peace to perform homosexual marriages when requested or be fired. Several Justices of the Peace immediately decided to resign. That order still stands. Also Town Clerks were for ced by the Governor's office to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples. Marriage licenses and certificates in Massachusetts now have \"Party A\" and \"Party B\" instead of \"husband\" and \"wife.\" Churches being harassed in Massachusetts - 10 - In 2005 hundreds of homosexual activists terrori zed the Tremont Temple Baptist Church with makeshift coffins, screaming ob scenities through loudspeakers as th e national pro-family group Focus on the Family held a religious conferen ce inside. The crowd was so threatening that attendees could not leave the church for the lunch break. In 2012 someone threatened to burn down a Cat holic Church in Acushnet which posted the words \"Two men are friends, not spouses\" on its outdoor sign. The church immediately received a flood of profane phone calls. At least one person threat ened to burn down the church. An activist nailed a sign to church's fence saying, \"Spread love not hate.\" Activists staged a protest outside of the Sunday Mass to intimidate parishioners with a sign saying, \"It is legal for two men or women to be spouses.\" Neither the police nor the District A ttorney pursued the threats as a hate crime or other offense. Politics in Massachusetts A climate of fear has kept politicians at all le vels from disagreeing with or criticizing same-sex marriage since it became \"legal.\" Public officials are afraid of being accused of wanting to \"take away rights.\" Those who support traditional marriage rarely discuss it publicly. And this fear has expanded to suppress any meaningful debate on a ll homosexual related issues. Additionally, it has brought a feeling of intimidation among pro-family people across the state. Every Massachusetts state-wide elected official and member of Congress (but one) now publicly supports \"gay marriage.\" The one (apparent) hol dout, Republican US Senator Scott Brown, strenuously avoids the issue, saying that it's \"settled law\" and not worth fighting over. Rule of Law in Massachusetts Same-sex \"marriage\" came to Massachusetts thr ough a radical court's narrow ruling. Because of that, there is an often depressing sense of help lessness that pervades this issue. The marriage statute was never changed, and it has been convincingly argued that the whole process was in violation of the state constitution. The Governor simply went along. And the Legislature acted to block popular votes on two separate constitutiona l amendments protecting marriage, after sufficient signatures had been gathered for each. Even the Massachusetts Law Library (online) s hows no law legalizing same-sex marriage, only a court opinion. It is a dangerous precedent to allow such sweepi ng judicial activism to stand as law, enabling everything that has followed from it. Massachusetts Experience Cited This goal is seen in Massachusetts, where court- mandated same-sex marriage has opened the door to a radical push for homosexual sex education in the public schools. In Lexington, a man by the name of David Parker requested that his ki ndergarten son be excused from this homosexual indoctrination. Mr. Parker's basic and reasonable parental request was denied by school officials and when he refused to retract it, he was not on ly denied, but arrested. He was not requesting a change in the curriculum; he was simply requesting that he be notified so that his six year old son could be absented from such indoctrination. Mr. Pa rker was not only arrested, but in his civil case the judge stated that Mr. Parker vacated his right s of input on these matters when he chose to send his son to public school. Canadian Experience http://www.law.harvard.edu/stude nts/orgs/jlpp/Vol29_No3_Allen.pdf Because legal regulations on marriage revolve aroun d children, and because same-sex families are fundamentally different from heterosexual ones in th is respect, this area poses the greatest risk of legal - 11 - misfit. Ironically, evidence for thes e changes appeared immediately af ter the introduction of same-sex marriage. For example, in Canada, the second half of Bill C-38, the Canadian federal Civil Marriage Act changing the definition of marriage, contains changes to other pieces of federal legislation removing the definition of natural parent and replacing it with \"legal\" parent. 39 A legal parent, like one of the partners within a same sex marriage, is not biologically linked to the child. Of course, there is no natural limit to the number of legal parents a child may have, and in a same-sex marriage with one child there are at least three adults involved in some role as parent, whether legal or not. The impact of creating \"legal\" parents will be felt in our culture for many years, and to the extent it is important for the biological connection between a child and parent to be recognized under the law, such a change can only harm heterosexual marriages. Unintended or unanticipated outcomes are the result of false theories of human behavior. Proponents claim that adding a small number of same-sex marriages into the net number of marriages benefits homosexuals with no costs to heterosexuals. Laws, if they are to have value, must necessarily come down on one side or another. As Coase pointed out over forty years ago, the question is not how to eliminate harm, but rather who should be allowed to hurt whom such that the greater harm is avoided? 77 Heterosexual marriage rules would be modified because they would be inappropriate for same-sex marriages. Summary: Inclusion Costs : Any type of couple that is included into marriage that requires a redefinition of marriage imposes a cost on the existing types of couples. Marriage has been designed for monogamous heterosexual couples. Any change to its institutiona l structure to accommodate others, must impose costs on the existing marriages. This is the argument of my paper in the Harvard Journal of Law & Public Policy . Historically the definition of parent has been \"natur al parent\" which has meant \"biological parent.\" There can only be two natural parents, and someone who is the biological parent has been given an entire set of rights and responsibilities. These rights and responsibilities have been designed to manage the problems that arise in procreation. Societies have wanted parents to have the proper incentives to remain married and to look after their offspring. It has always been a serious matter to alter these rights and responsibilities. Well, natural parenthood makes no sense when you introduce same sex marriage, because if there are children one of the spouses is not biologically connected. In jurisdictions that have same sex marriage there is always some type of redefinition to accommodate this. In Canada we created a concept called \"legal parent.\" In British Columbia this has meant a birth certificate asks for the mother's name and the \"co- parent's\" name. The concept of \"father\" has been redu ced. More significantly, ther e can be more than two legal parents. There have been a host of legal cases involving divorce where biology has no standing and non-biological but legally-connected parents have been given custody. This is a dramatic shift in the rights of parents, and affects the way parents behave. The impacts of these are yet to be fully seen. In Canada, the granting gays the right to marry is being used as an excuse for an all out assault on free speech and religious freedom, attacking any with opposi ng views as bigots engaged in \"hate\" speech. The shocking depth of this attack is chronicled by Hans C. Clausen, former Editor in Chief of the Vanderbilt Journal of Transnational Law, in his 66 page report published March 1, 2005. The \"privilege of speech\" in a \"pleasantly authoritarian country\": how Canada 's j udiciary allowed laws proscribing discourse critical of homosexuality to trump free sp eech and religious liberty. After describing Kempling's suspen sion from his teaching position for publicly expressing his views on homosexuality, Clausen then mentions several other coun tries that have criminalized remarks critical of homosexuality: New Zealand, South Africa , Netherlands and Denmark . In 2004, the Canadian Parliament passed C-250, sponsored by gay legislator Svend Robinson. The legislation added \"sexual orientation\" to the list of protected minority categories in Canadian la w. Because of this new la w, religious leaders are fearful of speaking out against homosexuality and, notes Clausen, \"Academicians al so seem to be feeling the effect: some university professors are scared that the law will threaten free inquiry in the classroom and in their own publications.\" In one legal case, a Ca nadian court justified its suppression of free speech because it claimed that criticism of gays impacted an individual's sense of \"self-worth and acceptance.\" The court also listed \"self- fulfillment,\" \"self-autonomy,\" and \"self-development,\" as reasons to suppress free speech in favor of gays. Clausen points out that this argument is seriously flawed because it favors the - 12 - speech rights of one group over another. The court al so claimed that criticism of homosexuality damaged the \"dignity\" of gays. Attack on Private and Home Schools In March 7, 2007 - Gay activist groups in Ontario urged the Provincial Ministry of Education to exert more control over private and home schools to fight against the alleged effects of homophobia, objecting to religious schools teaching only their own values. An ar ticle in Ottawa's Capital Xtra written by Tony Lovink, who describes himself as a gay Christian school teacher, claimed that \"All private schools tend to be at least implicitly homophobic. And I would say all religiously formed independent schools are definitely homophobia. In British Columbia, gay activists Murray Corren and Pe ter Corren were granted power over the provincial school curriculum as part of a lawsuit settlement. The settlement also introduced a policy prohibiting parents from removing their children from the classroom when gay-affirmative materials were being taught. Gay activists have demanded that the Federal Human Rights Commissions shut down three pro-family web sites run by Craig Chandler, a Canadian conservative and talk-radio host. http://www.cga.ct.gov/2007/JUDdata/Tmy/2007H B-07395-R000326-Rick%20McKinniss-TMY.PDF In Canada, in the short time since same-sex marriag e has been legalized court action has already been forwarded contesting the legal restrictions against po lygamy. The rationale for these court actions are a direct extension of the reasoning used to advance same -sex marriage. If marriage is to be afforded to any two persons who seek such a legal union, then on what logical basis is it to be denied to any three-or four-persons who, for whatever reasons, seek such a union. Once marriage has been removed from its basic binary formulation of a man and a woman entering a solemn covenantal union, who is anyone or any legislative body to limit it? CALIFORNIA PROP 8 RESEARCH: EFFECTS OF GAY MARRIAGE IN CANADA AND MASSACHUSETTS http://www.dailypaul.com/70673/legal-ramifications-of-gay-marriage Laws frequently have unforeseen consequences. Such is the case with gay marriage. A study of the effects of the judicial imposition of gay marriage on the people of Canada and Massachusetts provides a clear picture of how it is destroying freedom of speech and threatens our very democratic way of life. Most gays, particularly those who want to marry, are respectful of others views, but the activist Gay Lobby, that is driving the legal battles, has a very different agenda. A study of the world wide consequences of legalization of gay marriage, with particular attention to Canada and Massachusetts, clearly demonstrates that the agenda of the activist Gay Lobby is not gr anting homosexuals the legal rights associated with marriage but harnessing the power of the state to transform society in to their image and suppressing all opposing views. The legal record shows that, given the opportunity they will force their views upon everyone else, including and especia lly young children. Their objective, as clearly seen in the legal actions taken and the instructional materials being used in th e elementary schools, is not tolerance but celebration of homosexuality and gay pride while teaching that opposing views are mean spirited and hateful bigotry. And their attack extends beyond government supported institutions to private and home schools as they seek to deny parents the right to cont rol the moral teaching of their children. Minnesota testimony http://www.lifesitenews.com/news/im -gay-and-i-oppose-gay-marriage/ This isn't the first time our society has undefi ned marriage. No-fault divorce, instituted all across our country, sounded like a good idea at the time. Its unintended consequence was that it changed forever the definition of marriage from a permanen t relationship between spouses to a temporary one. Sadly, children became collateral dama ge in the selfish pursuits of adults. Same-sex marriage will do the same, depriving children of their right to either a mom or a dad. This is not a small deal. Children are being redu ced to chattel-like sources of fulfillment. On one - 13 - side, their family tree consists not of ancestors, but of a small army of anonymous surrogates, donors, and attorneys who pinch-hit for the ab sent gender in genderless marriages. Gays and lesbians demand that they have a \"right\" to have children to complete their sense of personal fulfillment, and in so doing, are trumping the ri ght that children have to both a mother and a father\u2014a right that same-sex marriage tramples over. Same-sex marriag e will undefine marriage and unravel it, and in so doing, it will undefine children. It w ill ultimately lead to undefining humanity. This is neither \"progressive\" nor \"c onservative\" legislation. It is \"regressive\" legislation. Nowhere on any marriage license app lication in any state are the applicants asked, \"Do you love each other?\" Yet this is the basi s on which same-sex marriage proponents seek to change our laws. Is the state really in the business of celebrating our romantic lives? What is the definition of a Socio-economic experiment? Socio-economics can also be called Social economics. \"'Social economics' may refer broadly to the \"use of economics in the study of society .\"[1] More narrowly, contemporary practice considers behavioral interacti ons of individuals and groups through social capital and social \"markets\" (not excluding for example, sorting by marriage) and the formation of social norms .[2] In the latter, it studies the relation of economics to social values .[3] In sociology , sociological theories are statements of how and why particular facts about the social world are related.[1] They range in scope from concise descriptions of a single social process to paradigms for analysis and interpreta tion. Some sociological theories explain aspects of the social world and enable prediction about future events,[2] while others function as broad perspectives which guide further sociological analyses.[3] From: calexto77@gmail.com To: JDLTestimony-WrittenOnly Subject: Marriage Equity Act, Date: Thursday, October 24, 2013 11:25:42 AM My name is Alexander Bernisto, me and my family reside in Kailua-Kona, my family and I would like to thanks all our Legislators for their service and their hard work in representing the people of Hawaii. We would like to let them know that we are against the Marriage Equity Act and we hope that our Legislators will vote against it as well. Thank you very much, Alexander Bernisto and FamilyCommittee on Judiciary & Labor Hearing on Monday, October 28, 2013 Time: 10:30 a.m. SB 1 Status & Testimony Relating To Equal Rights Dear Senator Clayton Hee: I am a voter in Hawaii and I would like to respectfully testify in writing that I do not support the passing of SB 1 regarding same -sex marriage. I believe that this bill in not related to equal rights but is in fact a moral issue which is against my beli efs as a Christian. It is stated in Genesis 1:27 -28 and 2:24 that God ordained marriage to be between a man and a woman. The Civil Union law which was passed by the legislature in 2011 affords the same benefits to same -sex couples as to all married couple in Hawaii, therefore it would be redundant to pass SB 1. I urge the Legislature to have voters of Hawaii decide the same -sex marriage issue by putting it on the ballot. Thank you very much for allowing me to testify in writing against SB 1. May God bless you as you help to guide our State in the coming years. Sincerely, Amy Shinagawa From: a jones To: JDLTestimony-WrittenOnly Subject: same sex marriage Date: Friday, October 25, 2013 6:22:27 AM aloha, please do not pass this bill, if you do it will change the dynamics of god's plan for all of us. you have an important role not only to the people of Hawaii but also to God. you will be judge accordingly for your decisions as the rest of us.

Shimabukuro, Vice AuditoriumState Capitol415 South Beretania Street SB1 RELATING TO EQUAL RIGHTS Testimony I oppose same sex marriage or any other forms of combination of marriage other than a man and a woman. Yes, I have heard the United States Supreme Court ruled the federal government cannot discriminate against persons on the basis of homosexuality. But just what are we discriminating against the homosexuals by denying them to marry each other? If it is benefits, then pass legislation to give them the same benefits as married couples. Homosexuality is a lifestyle choice, not a civil right. For example, I choose to live in Hawaii therefore I am required to pay income tax. I wish to have the benefit of paying no state income tax as in Alaska and Nevada, but I can't have it unless I choose to move to those states. Homosexuals can choose to marry, if they marry the opposite sex. We are not discriminating homosexuals from marriage. I do not want to legalize any form of marriage other than a man and a woman as it will open the door to other forms of combinations of marriage in the name of discrimination and/or civil rights. Athan Adachi1702 Subject: Testimony Against the Hawaii Marriage Equity Act of 2013 Date: Friday, October 25, 2013 9:52:57 AM I am Audrey Hyde. I represent my family and traditional marriage. I am testifying in regards to the Hawaii Marriage Equity Act of 2013, and let it be documented that I personally oppose this bill. I am opposed to the Act. As a mother of 6 children, I firmly believe that the traditional definition of marriage gives our children the best chance to grow up in a stable environment and become productive members of society. I am also opposed to the Act from a religious standpoint, as I believe that marriage between a man and a woman is an institution defined and ordained by God. I do not believe that this law will be beneficial to our State, and respectfully ask that you vote against it, or strengthen the religious exemptions in the law. I appreciate the time you have spent in hearing my position, which is in opposition to the Hawaii Marriage Equity Act of 2013. Thank You, Audrey HydeFrom: Barbara Brown To: JDLTestimony-WrittenOnly Date: Friday, October 25, 2013 5:05:07 AM I am submitting this testimony to say that I am against the passing of the Same- Sex Marriage Bill # SB1. I believe that the definition of marriage through the centuries and throughout most of the world has been the joining of a man and a woman. I do not believe that the majority of the people in the state of Hawaii want to change that definition. I also believe that such a major change in our cultural and religious beliefs should not be something decided in a rush special session. We the people of the state of Hawaii should decide this. We do not want our legislators making this decision for us. The possible consequences to our state and country if this bill passes are unbelievable. All you have to do is look at what has happened in places where same- sex marriage has passed, such as in Massachusetts and Canada. We are being told and that homosexuality is a civil right just like race. You are born into your race, but homosexuality is a choice. You can not change your race, but people move in and out of homosexual lifestyle. I see in this the taking away of the rights of one group and giving them to another. We see the right to express religious beliefs in schools etc taken away, but homosexual behavior is being openly celebrated with parades and gay clubs in schools etc. What is becoming of our country is reminding me of Rome. I believe you can love people and respect them, but you do not have to condone or celebrate their moral choices. Respectfully submitted, Barbara Brown From: Brad Barshaw To: JDLTestimony-WrittenOnly Subject: Same Sex Marriage Hearing Date: Thursday, October 24, 2013 10:05:06 AM My name is Brad Barshaw and have lived in Hawaii since 1981. My family and I were Family of the Year in Hawaii in 1990 and my wife got the Jefferson Award for Hawaii in 1991 and we have a deep love for the people here. We have fostered 57 children and adopted 3 of those as our own and my wife works in th foster care arena, one of my adopted daughters is a nurse at Queens and my other daughter works with Epic Ohana with kids in the foster care arena. Our church also provides mentors for hurting kids at a local emementary school. I am a pastor in Kailua and have had the privilege to talking with and helping all types of people including those who struggle with same sex sexual attraction. Though God has given us an amazing ability to love each each other and have authentic and healthy friendships with people of the same sex I believe a line is crossed even just physiologically when same sex people take their love into the sexual and marriage arena. Physiologically and spiritually it is a violation of the creators design and thus ultimately harmful to us physically, emotionally, sociologically and spiritually. We all have unhealthy bents and desires (drugs, lying, stealing, anger, sexual addictions beyond homosexuality etc.) that need to be conttolled and said no to if we are to pursue and experience the health that comes from following God's principles and design. I love our state and people. I believe in justice, respect and equal rights for all of us as long as it aligns with that which is beneficial and in sync with God's design and principles as given in the Bible. Please say no to okaying same sex marriage. Brad BarshawBrooke O'Day 874 Kahena St. Honolulu, HI 96825 October 23, 2013 The Honorable Clayton Hee, Chair The Honorable Maile S. L. Shimabukuro, Vice Chair Senate Judiciary and Labor Committee Hawaii State Capitol 415 South Beretania Street Honolulu, Hawaii 96813 Hearing Date: Mo nday, October 28, 2013 at 10:30 am Re: In Opposition to S.B. 1: The Hawaii Marriage Equality Act of 2013 Dear Senate Committee on Judiciary and Labor , I am opposed to S .B.1, The Hawaii Marriage Equality Act of 2013 , because it does not fully protect our freedom of religion. While I respect that not everyone shares my religious bel iefs, redefining marriage is a religious issue and i f passed would infringe on Christian beliefs. I have read the current form of the Hawaii Marriage Equality Act, and as it currently reads, section 572 -G regarding Religious Organizations is vague and may not pro tect my church's beliefs if challenged. Bishops of my church perform marriages for our members, as well as, non -members. This bill would requir e our bishops to perform same sex marriages or else risk fines, litigations, and possibly losing non -profit status. Also, while the bill attempts to protect religious organizations, it mentions nothing of protecting the rights of an individual's religious beliefs. I believe that marriage is a sacred ordinance between a man and a woman. Our country was founded on God and although society's definition of marriage is changing, God's never will. I urge you to vote NO on S.B. 1. Thank you for your time and leadership. Sincerely, Brooke ODay Hawaii Voter From: Friday, October 25, 2013 1:14:09 PM This is the testimony to be presented at the hearing regarding Same-Sex Marriage by C. Kaui Jochanan Amsterdam on Monday, Oct., 28, 2013. Notice also has been sent verifying that the testimony also will be provided by him in person before the hearing. Mahalo and Shaloha. Dear Officer of The Legislature of Hawaii: Herein is vital knowledge, my request, and my testimony to you. Mahalo and Shaloha (Shalom and Aloha), Kaui Jochanan Amsterdam n Saturday, October 19, 2013 1:37 PM, Charles kj Amsterdam <shaloha1@yahoo.com> wrote: Same-Sex Marriage's Impact On All Of Hawaii's People Like most people, my background influences my perspective. Being a Hawaiian Jew, I address the same-sex marriage issue. First, as part of my Hawaiian heritage's motto, Ua Mau Ka Ea O Ka Aina I Ka Pono, The life of the Land is Perpetuated in Righteousness, emphasizes that behavior be based on righteous, moral, ethical behavior, values, and principles. Such a sense of righteousness goes beyond the right of Hawaiian self-governance within the motto's historical context and is more inclusive as exemplified in the value of Aloha. Such moral behavior provides that the land and life of the people living on the land will be protected and preserved. Such benefits also are divine and come from G-d. On the other hand, disregarding or dismissing the motto emphasizing moral action or living will result in the withdrawal or elimination of divine protection and preservation of the land and life of people in Hawaii through prevailing danger and destruction. Such danger includes occurances such as hurricanes, tsunamis, earthquakes, terrorism, militarism, economic hardship, volcanic eruptions, natural disasters, pestilence, etc. In explaining such dangers, I do so with \"Aloha\" toward all our human ohana and without malice just as I would simply explain the dangerous impact of someone sticking their hand into flowing lava. Therefore, avoiding such danger and enjoying protection and preservation of the land and life of Hawaii's people simply require righteous, moral, and ethical behavior and living of the people of Hawaii. Secondly, while my Hawaiian heritage emphasizes righteous, moral, and ethical values, behavior, and living, my Jew(ish) heritage clarifies what is and is not morality and righteousness as provided by such sources as prophets, scriptures, inspired sacred writings, reasoning, and revelations from G-d. Such clarification is included by Christians and numerous other entities. Non-righteous behavior included certain relations such as same-sex or gender sexual relations, which is associated with same-sex marriage. While other non-righteous behavior includes dishonesty, corruption, domestic violence, murder, prostitution, physical and mental abuse, etc., same-sex marriage is central and is like the straw that breaks the camel's back. Furthermore, in this situation other supporting factors include that the current Act is unfair and undermines Democracy and the People of Hawaii's choice of preserving the tradition of marriage of a union of one man and one woman as seen in Chapter 572 Marriage, section S572C-2, which the current Act deletes and forces such Hawaii voters to be subjected to same-sex marriage dangers, that the Constitution's protection of religious freedom and the exercise of moral and ethical values predominates over the requirement of equal protection under the Law due to the behavior of same-sex marriage being of a non-moral or non-righteous standard of conduct, and that exemptions for clergy from performing same-sex marriages insufficiently and without impact omits congregants and church values. It's like exempting particular clergy from performing same-sex marriages on the Titanic and dismissing the dangerous Titanic situation, which is analagous to the destructive same-sex marriage situation in Hawaii. Thirdly, inasmuch as being identified as non-righteous, same-sex marriage violates the moral values expressed in Hawaii's motto and imposes devastating danger on the Land and Life of Hawaii's People. It is an unavoidable righteous, moral value issue, which, as such, if dismissed, will reap Catastrophe and, if honored, will \"Perpetuate the Life of the Land\". Shaloha (Shalom and Aloha), Kaui Jochanan Amsterdam Leader Kanaka Maoli JewFor the Senate hearing : Hearing on 10/28 @ 10:30am Clayton Hee, Chair Senate Committee on Judiciary and Labor Re: TESTIMONY IN OPPOSITION TO SB 1 RELATING TO EQUALITY Dear Honorable Chair Hee and Members of the Committee on Judiciary and Labor: I am opposing Same Sex Marraige because of our heartfelt concern and compassion for the future of our state. I concern over the physical, mental and emotional problems that will beset those who choose the homosexual lifestyle, and I object to what this wi ll do to our community, my children and to my traditional family life. Evidence clearly show that children must be raised in a traditional family environment to thrive and to grow. In addition, legalizing Same Sex Marriage will have a negative effect on the liberties of religious freedom, as it relates to what the Bible holds as God's Truth and Christians' freedom to teach from it. Government should never define moral value and limit the teachings of faith group. Legalizing Same Sex Marriage will put a threat to religious freedom. Therefore, please vote NO on any piece of the Same Sex M arriage bill! From: Bishop Carl E. Harris To: JDLTestimony OPPOSITION to SB1, relating to \"Equal Rights\" Date: Saturday, October 26, 2013 12:47:36 PM October 24, 2013 To: Senate Judiciary & Labor Committee From: Carl E. HarrisRe: Testimony In OPPOSITION to SB1, relating to \"Equal Rights\" Hearing Day & Date: Monday, Oct. 28 th Hearing Time & Place: 10:30am in the Hawai'i State Capitol Auditorium To: Chair, Senator Clayton Hee, Vice Chair, Senator Maile S. L.Shimabukuro and members of the Senate Judiciary & LaborCommittee, I am writing to voice my opposition to Bill SB1 and I am asking you to allow the people to decide on the issue of marriage as I believe the legislature is going against the will of the people. I support equality for all including the rights of conscience and religious freedom, which I ask youto respect as our elected leaders. I am opposed to the most contentious social issue in our state's history being decided virtually in one week and ask that you please uphold the principles of democracy and the democratic process which are being disregarded in this Special Session. Regarding the Special Session, this is the first time a Governor has convened a Special Session individually, without a Legislative Vote for thesole purpose of passing a newly introduced bill in nearly 20 years. The Legislature could have called itself into a Special Session but it didn't. I believe not only has Governor Neil Abercrombie overstepped his bounds by calling a Special Session without an agreement of the legislature, buthe is also unnecessarily burdening Hawaii taxpayers with yet anotherdebt. Our taxpayer money could have been used to pay off debts rather than making another one. This issue surely could have been addressed in the 2014 Legislative Session. This bill (SB1) should be given due process during the regular sessionwhere it can properly be vetted and examined as all other bills. The peoplewho elected you to serve as their voices should have a say in public policy that will forever obliterate thousands of years of indigenous and non-native culture, customs and traditions. Your \"yes\" vote in Special Session isclearly a NO vote to democracy! IF SB1 were to pass, the legalization of same sex \"marriage\" would take away my First Amendment rights. The First Amendment states: \"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof;...\" The precedence for this statement is what is going on in all the states where same sex \"marriage\" has been legalized. The negative effect it will have on our educational system will also begreat: the education and indoctrination of our children as early askindergarten in public schools is the pattern and operation of all otherstates where same sex marriage has been legalized. Also, in March 2007, a church group that owns beachfront property in New Jersey wanted to stand for their religious beliefs. They did not want a same sex \"civil union\" to be performed on their property. In January 2012, a judge ruled that the Ocean Grove Camp Meeting Association's refusal torent the oceanfront spot to the couple for their same-sex union violated thepublic accommodation provisions of the state's Law. Churches should be able to use their facilities in a way that is consistent with their beliefs! We should not lose our First Amendment rights just because a small group ofpeople in Hawaii want special rights . The Hawaii Civil Union Law provides all the same rights and benefits ofmarriage to same sex couples, except the use of the term. The term \"marriage\" is sacred and should not be used loosely. God has a definition for marriage in the Bible and while not all people read or believe the Bible,society has conformed to God's definition of marriage for over 500 years. Marriage between one man and one woman provides stability for children. Scientific studies with large samplings have found that children do best infamilies with a father and a mother, (opposite sex couples.) When we go outside the Creator's intent and parameters for marriage, weare opening the doors for all kinds of destructive and shamelessscenarios. We have to maintain a godly standard if we are to prosper here in Hawaii.In addition, during the extensive civil unions discourse, the ACLU wrote intheir testimony that they were going to stop at civil unions and not go on topush same sex \"marriage\" on the people of Hawaii. We now see that theACLU lied to the people of Hawaii. And former Representative Blake Oshiro who now works in the Governor's office said that none of the \"horribles\" that happened in other states where same sex \"marriage\" islegal would happen in Hawaii. Mr. Oshiro can't guarantee that. I don't know how he could blatantly lie to the people of Hawaii. Following the legalization of same sex \"marriage\" is the prohibiting of thefree exercise of religion in every state where same sex \"marriage\" is legal. I don't want to lose my First Amendment rights. My wife doesn't want to lose her First Amendment rights. As residents, registered voters, citizens, parents, grand-parents, pastors; we have to fight to preserve our godlystandards and traditions and uphold the truth that's in the Bible. That's what God has called us to do. Do not as a legislator take away our First Amendment Rights, the First Amendment Rights of all the pastors inHawaii, the First Amendment Rights of all the religious people in Hawaiiand the generations to come. I appeal to you to exercise, integrity and concern for the people of Hawaii and vote NO on same sex \"marriage\" andthat you will let the people decide! Respectfully, Bishop Carl E. HarrisBishop Carl E.

Shimabukuro, Vice Chair Senate Committee on Judiciary and Labor Re: TESTIMONY IN OPPOSITION TO SB 1 RELATING TO EQUALITY By: Carol K. Nakata 99-129 Uahi Street Aiea, HI 96701 Dear Honorable Chair Hee, Vice Chair Shimabukuro, and Members of the Committee on Judiciary and Labor: Please allow me to share two stories that relate to same-sex marriage. 1) After 9 mos. of pregnancy, my young nephew and his wife were joyfully expecting to welcome their first child. Instead, his wife died during childbirth. The baby, though, survived. This left the husband and extended family with deep grief, and years of coping in hardship. 2) After 8 months of pregnancy, my cousin was expecting to celebrate a new birth. Instead, the baby was delivered dead in a miscarriage. I cite these stories of real grief & suffering to highlight the risks & sacrifices that heterosexual couples endure in the rendering of their uniquely natural contribution of children to society. Homosexual marriages could never match in value the rigors and expenses borne in heterosexual marriages -- of natural childbearing, of raising kids in homes balanced with the unique traits of male & female parents, and the perpetuation of the human race. As one who's single, I gladly support any special benefits and rights above my own that we as society grant to traditional couples. They deserve it. The value of their contributions to society are unique, and far exceed what other persons can offer, either singly or as couples. A true inequality would result if this Legislature grants homosexual couples the status of marriage on par with heterosexual couples. It would mean the granting of equal rights & benefits for unequal contributions.

However, what you are about to do now will have a far-reaching effect on ALL of us. How can you take away the voice of the registered voters in Hawaii? It is so underhanded! You will most certainly lose our trust. We will remember this and I am sure you will each, individually put some of the voters in your districts at odds with you. On top of it all remains the fact that we did vote a constitutional amendment (Art. 1, Section 23) in 1998. This amendment still reads the same. It can not be interpreted any other way. Do the right thing now--Vote no or let the people's voices beheard. Mahalo,Carolee FernandezRegistered voter I will praise thee, O Lord my God, with all my heart and I will glorify thy name for evermore . Psalm 86:12To: The Honorable members of the Senate and the House of the Hawaii State Legislature From: Caroline Ward Oda - a registered voter 88 Wailupe Circle ~ Honolulu, HI 96821 y Date: October 24, 2013 ' Re: SB 1 Relating to Equal Rights I have some deep concerns about SB 1 coming up in the scheduled special session at the end of this month. I ask that you vote against it for the following reasons: 1-The group in favor of same sex unions -which I also favored -promised a year ago that that would be satisfactory and that they would not push for same-sex marriage. 2-The public accommodation protections for churches are insufficient partly because there is a misunderstanding of \"membership\" in relation to churches. Churches welcome many people who are not members. For example, our church shows free movies for families in Chinatown once a month. (You can imagine how costly it is for families on limited incomes to go to the movies with four or five people in the group.) We throw a big community fair for Chinatown in the Spring. We also provide a safe Halloween event which was attended by over 300 last year with 500 expected in a few weeks. At all of these events \"non\u00ad members\" are welcome. 3-We also rent our facility to other organizations such as St. Andrew's Priory School which has produced dramas, businesses that have group meetings (as you know there is a shortage of rental meeting spaces downtown ) and other churches that have no facility of their own. Renting would mean that we fall under the \"public accommodation\" definition in the current bill. 4-The fourth reason I ask you to vote against the bill is that by extending the definitions of protection for sexual orientation, currently a protected class, as the bill does, the freedoms proscribed for that group transgress freedom of speech. In a nation where we can burn the flag. put bomb-making instructions on the internet and display profanity on bumper stickers, our freedom of speech should not be curtailed by designating a group so protected that other opinions cannot be shared. Again, I ask that you defeat SB 1. Thank you, Caroline Ward Oda From: pukamail@yahoo.com To: JDLTestimony Subject: Aloha. Same Sex Bill Date: Thursday, October 24, 2013 10:39:57 PM Aloha. Firstly, Thank you for all the hard work and dedication to all of the people of Hawaii. I would like to discuss the same sex bill and how it uniquely effects our State. Is the motivating factor behind this bill to receive federal dollars? This certainly is not for equality for all as this bill has been presented to the public. I can't understand how politicians seem to deceive the public for personal gain or power. Think about this, are not bills passed by majority vote? Is not the president and all public positions elected by a majority vote. Why, because they are to represent the public democracy. I think the government has redefined democracy to whatever is mainstream at the time. The majority of taxpayers in Hawaii have voted against this bill, but politics seem to ignore this fact. The guise of this particular bill indicates equality for all. Lets review some fact: 1. Majority of voters in Hawaii overwhelmingly disagree that this bill is the best interest for the state. 70% said no to your bill.2. Those majority of voters are not necessarily Christian, they could be of no religious affiliation.3. Homosexual population are less than 10%, nationwide. The percent of the population who are looking for these equal rights are even less. 4. This bill will effect the remaining percent, 90%? 5. This bill will unequally benefit a very small portion of the population.6. Homosexuals can already be married through a civil union ceremony, I am not clear the purpose of this bill is for equality or a soapbox to persecute any person who opposes them.7. All of the children in public schools will be forced homosexual objectives, even against parents wishes. Homosexual books, no more celebrations of Mothers or Fathers days in elementary or middle schools because it oppresses homosexual rights under the new law. Even when less then 10% of the population is homosexual and even less than that are actually married. What about the man who wanted to marry his goat (this is a true story, unfortunately). Would we pass a equality bill to include marriages between animals and people? What I am saying is how far is this going to go?8. Freedom of religion and religious persecution is a part of our constitution and bill of rights. Passing this law will persecute all religions who oppose that lifestyle. Religious people are not oppressing homosexuals personally, but oppose to being forced to participate in their lifestyle. We should be protected in America to exercise our given rights, no new laws should supersede that basic right. It's law is being placed as to oppress all religions and have a platform to legally harm all who oppose them. May I remind you that this percent is probably less than 5% of the population, so 5% can oppress 95%. Does this seem fair? Not to me.9. The separation of church and state goes both ways. Keep your state out of my church.10. Those who may agree with this bill might not be thinking about the percussion of future events. This is not just a religious rejection of this bill. This bill sets up the 95% for a plethora of future petty lawsuits from homosexuals who didn't get their photo in newspapers or equal rights to Christmas specials and radio and tv time, etc. anyways, there will be a huge opening of frivolous \"they hurt my feelings\" \"I didn't get my fair share\" complaining. This bill so guaranteeing all homosexuals the right to sue anyone if they perceive disagreement with them, they will use this bill to purposely oppress all people, sort of a \"payback for all those folks who hurt their feelings their whole life\". I'm sorry, they are a bunch of babies always crying about their rights. If your gay, then be gay. Homosexuals just want to use a law to oppress non-homosexuals. How has homosexuals convince you politicians that they just want equality. I know its not about equality. its about them forcing their lifestyle into the forefront of society, even if they are a small part of society. Why do you have to pass this particular law for them to be equal? If its about insurance or money, then pass a bill to allow partners to receive retirement benefits and what not other benefits. Marriage does not necessarily guarantee homosexuals that life will work out perfectly, they will be just as susceptible to divorce than all other couples. Studies prove that divorce in homosexual couples equal hetero divorces. 11. What about my free speech rights? Now will I be prohibited from saying I don't agree with the gay lifestyle? Why isn't it my right to disagree, and I quietly disagree only to myself. I don't agree with people marrying animals either. Will I be fined or go to jail if I say so? What if I write a letter to the editor in the newspaper saying the same, will I be arrested? This bill is removing my basic rights as a American. Too oppressive society and overly governed. This small percent of society is controlling the majority, this is not about equality. It's about controlling hetero and anti homosexual behavior. It's about favoring less than 5% of the population over the rest, it's not right. I agree that no one should oppress homosexuals, but I disagree with legislation to give a format to control every personal right that has been in effect in this country since inception for all people. Homosexuals have all the rights to put heterosexuals down and say \"you hate us, etc.\" which is not true. They can say anything to us, but if they are slightly offended, they will sue. This law is wrong. I love my homosexual family members, but I still disagree with homosexual marriage. I should be allowed to think so in this country, unless I am living in a communist state.12. Homosexuals are covered by the civil rights laws anyways, why do they need more legislation? Why does the laws have to be only for gay people? This is so odd that our country is favoring such a small community. I have never seen any homosexual oppressed. All prior laws have been passed by the majority, allow the voting record stands, Hawaii voted no to this bill. you should be better representatives and listen to what They function just as all citizens do without any interruption. Why does there need to be offensive legislation to every person who is not gay? Why not just add addendum to the civil rights bills? Homosexuals are not oppressed as a whole, as African Americans were pre civil rights days. Homosexuals have all the rights as anyone does. There is no real evidence that this extreme of a law must be put into effect. Tax law, inheritance laws, benefits laws, etc can be changed then making a overlying law into effect that essentially oppresses the masses who are not homosexual. This is wrong. 13. I reject any legislation that prohibits me from practicing my religion, freedom of speech, freedom of choice. I should be able to defend my position without being forced by law and threat of lawsuits. I already have to include homosexuals at work, in the community, and every part of American life, why now do I have to include homosexual advantage into my personal life and religion by force. Everything has been working fine in society up to now, this law is too vague and too overly general and it oppresses more people than it is intending to serve. The civil rights of homosexuals should be protected, like serving at a restaurant or other establishment. But when you tell me I cannot object to how I live my life is too personal, if a owner of a private establishment does not want to serve homosexuals due to their religious beliefs, should be allowed to do so, because they are not a public entity or a government entity. I do not oppress homosexuals, but they are trying to oppress me. They use the Christians as a whipping post, but all major religions object to homosexual marriage. Homosexuals were around during biblical times, look at Sodom and Gomorrah and how young boys were forced into sexual slavery and raped because it was a belief that it was their civil right in their society. Where does the morals stand in society? Where is it going in our State? I do not oppress homosexuals because it is within my religion not to hate the sinner, but tell the truth in love. This whole bill is wrong, it oppresses the majority, it oppresses my right to religion. 14. I do not think this law is to everyone's benefit. A new more inclusive law that allows rights already guaranteed by law that this new law cannot supersede.15. It is not true that heterosexuals are separating \"homosexual families\". Family should be ohana, be who you are. Hawaii has traditionally accepted all kinds of families. It is unfair to throw that accusation out there, that is a dramatic act to gain acceptance, but is not true. A dirty tactic. Keep the vote of the majority of this states rights valid. We don't want it in our schools, in our hospitals, in our churches. Stop this favoring one group over the other for greedy benefit of federal dollars. Keep your state out of my religion.Sincerely, Carrie Ehrgott TaxpayerCitizenOpposer of this particular billVoter who is not afraid to vote for someone else next round Sent from my iPadFrom: Katie J To: JDLTestimony Subject: Re: TESTIMONY IN OPPOSITION TO SB 1 RELATING TO EQUALITY Date: Saturday, October 26, 2013 7:07:29 AM To: Clayton Hee, Chair and The State Committee on Judiciary and Labor Date and Time of Hearing: Monday, October 28th, 10:30 a.m. Re: TESTIMONY IN OPPOSITION TO SB 1 RELATING TO EQUALITY Dear Honorable Chair Hee and Members of the State Committee on Judiciary and Labor: I, Catherine Jacobsmeyer, admit right up front that my opposition to the Hawaii Marriage Equality Act of 2013 is based in part on my spiritual/religious beliefs. I acknowledge that there are those in Hawaii who do not share my religious beliefs, butI want you to know I feel very strongly that this act is wrong, and its passage would bea serious mistake. My husband, my five children, and I are all opposed to same-sex marriage. We believe that we are a \"nation under God,\" and as such, we will receiveblessings as we obey His commandments. We believe marriage between a man andwoman is ordained of God, and that sexual activity should only occur between a manand woman who are married. We also believe that God's doctrines don't change,even when man's views change with the times. Our opposition to this legislation doesnot reduce our regard for all people, including individuals burdened by same sexattraction. However, as residents of Hawaii, we ask that you do not legalize same-sex marriage in this state. Marriage between a man and woman is and always has been the basic building block for human civilization and is the natural medium by which God intends for His childrento come into the world and be nurtured to adulthood. Children are entitled to birth andrearing within the bonds of matrimony between a man and a woman. This union doesfar more than merely meet the needs of the involved adults. While the long term results of a child's being reared in a same sex marriage have not been completelyexplored, I intuitively shudder to think of the possible negative effects and havoc itmight wreak. I acknowledge the high number of single parents who are rearing children and doing an excellent job. I also acknowledge that the motivated single parent can often compensate for the missing role model of the mother or the father inthe children's lives. But I'm most concerned about the parental model consisting of asame-sex couple's being deeply implanted in the child's mind through parental modeling. This unnatural imprint and influence may have lasting and devastating consequences. I grew up in a household where my sister struggled with same-sex attraction. Whether this condition was \"foisted off\" on her without her having played any causative role or not, she has the agency to decide her behavior. I believe in her case and with many others, they would have it the other way if they could. I acknowledge that living out one's life and trying to maintain the moral standard ofchastity\u2014in this case celibacy\u2014is most difficult. But it is possible, and I feel strongly that when a couple\u2014whether they be homosexual or heterosexual\u2014has sexualrelations outside of marriage, they are guilty of breaking a fundamental and most vitalprinciple of God's law. This issue is bigger than the question of whether society should be more tolerant. If passed, this act would infringe on religious freedom and redefine marriage, creating a new \"civil right.\" I rue the day when a judicial court of the land decides to penalize our churches because we refuse full religious privileges to same sex couples livingtogether. I know that our church will never\u2014and I emphasize never\u2014acknowledge same-sex marriage as being morally correct. I regard the Hawaii Equality Marriage Act of 2013 as a real potential violation of our basic First Amendment rights. In addition, my family and I feel the rights embodied in Amendment I, which alsoguarantee religious freedoms to those involved in businesses and other organizationsmust be preserved. If this legislation passes, we ask for stronger exemptions forreligious clergy, religious institutions, religious facilities, and small businesses thanare currently proposed. We urge that these exemptions be extended to all people andorganizations of faith, so as to protect religious groups from being required to support,condone, or perform same-sex marriages or to host same-sex marriages in theirfacilities. We must protect individuals and small businesses from being required to assist in promoting or celebrating same-sex marriages. Finally, as a mother of five wonderful daughters, I am haunted by the possible negative effects that the passing of this bill could have on them. After studying someof these negative effects that are happening in states such as Massachusetts, I havedecided that I do not want that for my children. If passed, the teaching that same-sexmarriage is normal would permeate into our schools and reach impressionablechildren as young as four years of age. It would also infect our public libraries, our media, our businesses, and our churches.I plead with you. Please consider our views and oppose this bill. Thank you. Catherine P. JacobsmeyerFrom: Cecilia Mukai To: JDLTestimony Subject: SB EQUAL RIGHTS - VOTE \"NO\" Date: Friday, October 25, 2013 1:52:05 PM Aloha, Hawaii Senate Judiciary and Labor Committee I wish to register my opposition to the passage of SB 1. I believe the \"equal rights\" being promoted is the overstepping of the rights of the majority of Hawaii citizens, who already voted for the institution of marriage to be between a husband and a wife, by that of a minority. Hawaii has been called the \"Health State\" and statistics supports better health outcomes of families with a father and mother in the home. Let's keep Hawaii healthy. I urge you to vote against the bill regarding same sex marriage Date: Friday, October 25, 2013 11:25:47 AM My name is Celeste Tefan and I am a wife and homemaker. I am testifying in regards to S.B. NO. 1, and let it be documented that I personally oppose this bill and any fraction thereof. I believe in traditional marriage and do not agree with same sex marriage. I have been learning about this new proposed bill and do not believe that it protects MY rights and religious freedoms so I am STRONGLY OPPOSED to it. The people of Hawaii have voted on this issue before! Why does it keep popping up again? And why is our vote as a populace not being taken into consideration? I appreciate your time and pray that my religious beliefs will be protected, and that this current bill will not pass. Thank you very much,Celeste SB1 Date: October 24, 2013 6:11:44 PM Greetings, In his \"letter from Birmingham jail\" Martin Luther King Jr. wrote about something he called \"just\" and \"unjust\" laws. He made a clear distinction between both of them. In his words: \"A just law is a man made code that squares with the moral law or the law of God. An unjust law is a code that is out of harmony with the moral law.\" According to the Bible, marriage is ordained by God to be between a man and a woman. The Biblical viewpoint of marriage has been the universal understanding of marriage in every human civilization in world history. I believe in the sanctity of marriage as that loving union between one man and one woman. Anything less, in my eyes, would be \"out of harmony with the moral law\" or the law of God. As my voice in government, I urge you to support what we know as truth, traditional marriage. Sincerely, Charleen KagenoFrom: Charles 27, 2013 9:40:38 AM Say \"NO\" to same-sex marriage. These islands are special in God's eyes. Please keep them that way. These islands have a lot to work on but we have always tried to do what is right in the sight of GOD. I know everyone has heard the saying God created Adam and Eve, GOD did not create Adam and Steve. (Genesis Chapter 1). This not a joke it is the truth. The scriptures below are what HE has said. Let's us as a small island speak loudly and stand before a big Nation and declare that these islands have integrity and morals and will still Love and Serve a GODaccording to HIS words. Again, Please vote \"NO\" to same-sex marriage Please read the scriptures below to see what God says about same-sex marriage.

Shimabukuro and members of the Senate Judiciary & Labor Committee We are Christian & Janell Beattie, husband and wife. We are testifying on the measure SB1. We are in strong OPPOSITION to SB1.The Supreme Court has already said that gay rights is not a civil rights issue. Therefore, we believe that by legalizing gay marriage, you would be trying to normalize or legitimize this lifestyle and behavior. This lifestyle is not normal. With this lifestyle comes many physical consequences such as: HIV, HSV, It takes a man and a woman to procreate. God intended it that way. Babies cannot come from two males or two females. If you legalize gay marriage, it would be detrimental to our society, our state, our children. Homosexuals will have the right to come into our public schools and teach children that homosexuality is accepted. Would you want your children to learn that lifestyle is normal? Homosexuality Is NOT NORMAL. In 1998, the people of Hawaii already decided to oppose same sex marriage. We did not give the legislature the power to redefine marriage. Let the people of Hawai'i vote! If you do your research where other states have legalized same sex marriage, you will see the destruction it is causing to theircitizens including their children.

After all, people put you where you are and allow you to be paid to sustain yourselves and your families. Your job is to listen to thepeople and vote according to the will of the majority of the people. After all, majority rules. We proposethat law makers vote NO on this measure and create the opportunity for this issue to be presented asa ballot issue that the people of Hawaii can vote on. It costs money to do a special session, so if youare willing to spend money on a special session, then you must be equally willing to put this issue to avote of the people. Our gay brothers and sisters are equally protected under the constitution. This is not a fight about anger or discrimination against the gay community. This is a stand for moral principle and the health ofsociety that is conducive to the well being of children being raised by one man (father) and one woman(mother). The institution of marriage between a man and a woman has a higher purpose than just\"love\". We testify that the sacred powers of procreation are to be employed only between a man and awoman, lawfully wedded as husband and wife. This is the only ordained means whereby children arecreated and brought to the earth. There is no other way. You will do damage to the fundamental unit of society and bring about confusion, costly, negative consequences and ills to the individuals and people of this state with this bill. You will DO RIGHT to strengthen society and protect the sanctity of marriage (1man+1woman) and family when you - LET THE PEOPLE VOTE ON MARRIAGE.

The effects would be devastating to island families and their future generations. It is a slippery slope that once we start down it there will be no turning back. One would just need to look closely at the states that have enacted this as legislation to see the \"hand-cuffing\" effects it will have on religious freedoms and rights as parents/grandparents in raising our keikiaccording to what we believe is right and true. The will of the Hawaii people was already expressed already by voters as keeping marriage defined as between one man and woman. It is really a travesty that only a handful of legislators will decide the outcome of whether this becomes law or not. It should be a decision of all the people of Hawaii, especially regarding legislation that will have farreaching effects into our families and generations to come. We should not simply jump on the band wagon because other states have done so, this doesnot make it right. Hawaii should stand up for what is right, which my family and I entirely believe is a bill that should not become a law. Respectfully Submittted, Cline D. ArdoFrom: Clive Cowell To: JDLTestimony-WrittenOnly Subject: EQUAL RIGHTS Date: Thursday, October 24, 2013 8:04:38 AM I wish to submit to the following testimony. First, of all I wish to apologize for remarks made in our community that are derogatory to other human beings. Names, slurs and disgust aimed at others should have no place if we are to treat each other in love. I state my own apology because I see myself as a part of this community, not a separate being. We can do better and must do better if we are to treat one another in love. When I read and hear comments that are disparaging, I hold my own head in shame. I apologize. Second, I wish to present my voice in opposition to the recognition of marriage between same sexes. Here is why. My argument is philosophical, rooted in how I see God theologically; it is based on the notion of His expression of love. I thank you greatly for taking the time to read this testimony. It is a privilege, and one I am thankful for. Thank you for your service to others. Again, here is my testimony of opposition against what is known as \"Same sex marriage.\" C.S. Lewis wrote that the words from the Bible, \"'God is love' have no real meaning unless God contains at least two persons. Love is something that one person has for another person. If God was a single person, then before the world was made, He was not love. '\" Mere Christianity, (San Francisco, Harper Collins, 1980), 1974 . If we are to understand that 'God is love,' as presented from the Bible in 1 John 4:8, we must acknowledge or reject that position. If we accept that God is love, we must also accept that He was a being of 'two' in the beginning. If not from the beginning, then, again, God could not have been love. Of course, C.S. Lewis was referring to God the Father, and God the Son, namely, Jesus Christ, as the two eternal beings - who loved each other as Father and as a beloved Son; from the beginning and, even until this time. The role of the Holy Spirit, another being, was to communicate that love; as spirit speaks to spirit . With these three beings, we understand that there is perfect love. A Father and a Son, and One (the Holy Spirit) that communicates the love between the two. To continue, God expresses Himself personally as Father, Son and Holy Spirit in mutual love and glory. The \" oneness \" of God implies His inherent unity and equality; God is \" wholly other \" in union and communion. Having established, by way of amplifying the Biblical text, the notion that God is \" wholly other \" it should be noted that God's giving love is not exclusive for He expresses His love by creating \" all things, visible and invisible .\" The Triune God called all of creation into existence - \" and it was good \". His loving desire was to create a universe with relational beings (the male-female \" man\") in His own image and to enjoy all that He had created - \"and it was very good \". Why? Because the Father wanted to share His Son with others in His creation in order to spread the goodness of their own shared love and glory, and to offer His Son a beautiful bride, perfectly suited to Him: \"For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall be joined unto his wife, and they two shall be one flesh. This is a great mystery: but I speak concerning Christ and the church .\" Ephesians 5:31-32. The end of the Bible is instructive: \"Come, I will show you the bride, the wife of the Lamb .\" Revelation 21:9. True human love must always have Christ as its ultimate focus (as the Father's love for the Son sets out) and its greatest priority (as we were made by God to be lovers of God). True love is that He (the Father) accepts us IN CHRIST; he values us IN Christ; and he forgives us IN Christ ) as opposed to a human-focused-separate from God 'love' which is all about, and only, \" us\", \" us\", \" us\". The objects of our worship are not each other, nor the self, but the Father and the Son; this is true love. The Spirit is the One who inspires and enables us to worship in such a way. God wanted His love to be eternally spread out among His creation desiring man and woman to freely have Christ as the ultimate focus (as the Father's love for the Son sets out) and greatest priority (as we were made by God to be lovers of God). Yet in that freedom man and woman, replaced Christ as the focus embracing the Serpent's call (See Genesis 3) to be like God themselves [God's freedom even allowed the one originally intended to lead worship and love of God to turn inwardly and away from God, Ezekiel 18]. In responding to the call and becoming self-lovers, the male and female abused their moral freedom and rebelled against God, thus destroying the loving holy union they originally enjoyed with Him; they were no longer loyal to God and they had broken loyalty to each other. The loving life of fellowship they previously enjoyed was broken and resulted in eternal separation; they were now spiritually dead, giving birth to Spirit-less people; self-loving people. Their focus was and continues to be a focus on the self, and the greatest priority is the self - such is the nature of their deadness. The ultimate expression of this is to love and serve the self - the Greek word homo: meaning same would express such a notion. By way of contrast, when tempted by the devil, the Son remained loyal to the Father, and even when the Son took the sin of the world upon Himself on the cross, the Father remained loyal to the Son. My testimony is that God is love. More importantly, that testimony is itself from the Bible, so, 1 John 4:8. My testimony is that God's love is creative. The notion of His love is one of union and communion. That can only be expressed in otherness, not in sameness. God is \"other \" focused, or to use the Greek term, God is \" hetero \" in His outward focus. This is what He is. What is God not? God is not \" self-serving \" or to use the Greek term \" homo.\" Love that is relationally only toward the same, i.e., homo, will never be creative. And if not creative, then while those beings may ' love' each other, they will not, nor never can they be creatively loving, in and of themselves; even if they express, \" we have love .\" God created beings to love \" the other \", meaning he created a male to love a female. This is how we can picture \" otherness \". These male-female creatures were made not just to love each other, but to be in union with God as a male-female oneness. In that oneness they are to be Christ's other love. That is to say, Christ and the male-female are the relational image of God. This is very good in God's eyes. Anything different runs counter to God's stated desires. It is why God paints such striking tones in both the Old Testament and New Testament. \"Do not practice homosexuality, having sex with another man as with a woman. It is a detestable sin .\" Leviticus 18:22 \"If a man practices homosexuality, having sex with another man as with a woman, both men have committed a detestable act. They must both be put to death, for they are guilty of a capital offense .\" Leviticus 20:13 \"those who practice homosexuality... none of these will inherit the Kingdom of God \" 1 Cor. 6:9-11. \"men who practice homosexuality, ... contrary to sound doctrine .\" 1 Tim. 1:8-10. Ultimately, our relationship in God is based on a submission to the other , namely, God. If we are to circumvent that position, by claiming equality with God, we discount Him as God. Such an effort is our effort to be the same as Him. Such an effort, such a desire, is to be homo, that is, \" same \". But we are not God. He is. He wants us in relationship with Him, even though, and this shows His amazing love, even though we want to be God. He offers that relationship to us, even though we are hetero to Him. This is part of His love. He loves the other . The LORD God invites such a relationship, but it necessarily requires a change of heart in how we view ourselves. For God will not encounter that which is against His own desires, will, and Kingdom. There can only be One God, and no other God. Our image of our self is tragically polluted. We believe that we can aspire to \" great\" heights if we bring about equality as we see it. Yet such a road, if traveled, will always run away from our true humanity in God. I state \"no\" to the recognition of what is known as same sex marriage. In love, and, as I see it, from a standpoint of what the Bible proclaims, I make these statements. More importantly, beyond my testimony, is the call for our community to look to His own words, the Bible; a greater testimony than mine. Clive M. CowellFrom: Crystal Dohie To: JDLTestimony-WrittenOnly Subject: Testimony on Senate \"Equal Rights\" Date: Thursday, October 24, 2013 7:16:23 AM Honored Senate Committee on Judiciary and Labor, I am very troubled by this bill, ironically named, \"Equal Rights.\" We were told that equal rights was what the Civil Union bill was supposed to accomplish. This bill under review now crosses the line and penalizes those whose consciences and opinions disagree with the LGBT. Freedom of thought, freedom of religion, freedom of speech, property rights are all in peril with this law that could make mere disagreement a crime. This is not \"equal rights.\" This is an assault on freedom of conscience. It is a travesty against the good people of Hawaii to put this kind of burdensome yoke on their back. Mainland agenda can stay on the mainland. Hawaii has always been a welcoming place of aloha to all people everywhere. We do not need this kind of legislation. It is insulting and discriminatory. Please throw out this bill. Thank you.-- Crystal DohieFrom: Dale Hammond To: JDLTestimony Subject: Bill 1, Special Session of Legislature Date: Friday, October 25, 2013 12:02:41 PM Senator Clayton Hee COMMITTEE ON JUDICIARY AND LABOR Senate Bill 1 Monday, October 28, 2013 10:30 a.m. Auditorium, State Capitol, 415 South Beretania Street We are Dale & Carol Hammond, representing ourselves from Laie of your district We are testifying on Bill 1 of the Special Session called by Governor Ambercrombie.We are adamantly opposed to the passage of Bill 1 dealing with the legalization of same gender marriage for the following reasons:1. Our major objection is that same gender marriage is offensive in the eyes of God, who created the Earth for the benefit of man and decreed in the Garden that marriage should be between a man and a woman for the procreation of the species and for the benefit of the children. However, we realize that many people now-a-days have lost respect for God and drifted away from his Gospel. How they live their lives is up to them, but the majority are still God fearing people and their conscience is opposed to this action.2. However, from a human cultural perspective, from the beginning of society thousands of years ago, nearly all cultures have recognized that to preserve their society, it was necessary to procreate the species, which obviously is only possible between a male and a female partner. In addition, a formalized association between those two individuals was found necessary for the well being of the society and the proper upbringing of the offspring from that procreation. Thus, marriage between a man and a woman has been with us from the very beginning of society and has been shown time after time to be of the greatest advantage to a well functioning society. And, until very recently, from a historical perspective, divorce was either not allowed or was very difficult to obtain, in order to preserve the society. Since the arrival of no fault divorce, society has significantly gone down hill.3. Modern scientific study has shown that males and females are hard wired from before birth to bring different and complimentary characteristics to that association. When both are functioning in their proper roles the children of that marriage stand a far better chance of contributing to society rather that becoming problems to such. When either the mother or the father vacates the home, by divorce, desertion, etc., the children suffer, and it is most often that the father is unfortunately absent from the home and the mother is left to fend on her own. Examine the following statistics from Government and scholarly research on the absence of a father in the home (The source is the Hutchison Report, Oct. 22, 2013, individual references are given with each statistic: EFFECTS OF A FATHERLESS HOME, Pastor Hutchinson report, The Blaze.com, Tuesday, October 22, 2013) 63% of youth suicides are from fatherless homes. (US Dept. Of Health & Census) 80% of rapists with anger problems are from fatherless homes. (Justice & Behavior V14)70% of children w/ involved father less likely to drop out of school. (Nat. Household Ed. Survey) 75% of teens in chem. abuse centers from fatherless homes. (Rainbows for all God's children) 53% teen girls from fatherless homes more likely to marry as teens. (Parents & Prisons Policy Rev. 2003)711% of girls from fatherless homes more likely to have kids as teens. (Ibid)164% of girls from fatherless homes more likely to have premarital sex. (Op.Cit.)92% of teens from fatherless homes more likely to divorce even if do get married. (Parents, op cit)90% of homeless and run-aways are from fatherless homes. (US Dept. Justice, Sp Rep, 1988)71% of pregnant teens are from fatherless homes. (Dept. Of Health & Human Services) Do you think that not having a father in the home affects our next generation?We know that many valiant single women work very hard to overcome these disadvantages of not having a father in the home and do very well. That is why the statistics are not higher, but the statistics are there and society suffers as a result of not having so many fathers in the home. Bill 1 will only contribute of these homes. 4. Same gender relationships DO NOT convey that same stability to society. Two women can not make up for the lack of the influence of a man in the home, and two men can not compensate for the lack of influence of a woman in the home. The result is not the same and this has been recognized from the beginning of society on this earth.5. One of the most profound concerns of the Founding Fathers of this nation was that of conscience! Under King George, conscience was not allowed! It was his way all the way. From the beginning of this nation conscience has been inviolate! The first amendment was specifically proposed to protect conscience! This principle of conscience has served this nation for nearly 250 years. But now it is being seriously attacked! Because of the complications of the necessity of exemptions for religious organizations, their facilities and any ancillary organization associated with them, passage of the bill will be a nightmare for a large portion of the people of Hawaii whose conscience requires them to follow the laws of God. These individuals will now be inundated with lawsuits, as has been evidenced in other areas of the country where same gender marriage has been passed. In addition, LGBT doctrine will be forced into being taught in the schools systems, forcing people of conscience to pull their children out of the public schools and either home school them or pay for private school systems.6. Lastly, all this is being pushed by a very small minority of the population of this state and of the nation, whose admitted goal is to teach their lifestyle in the schools and make it respectable in America. It is estimated that those involved in the LGBT movement of Hawaii are less than 1,000 individuals, and constitute 0.002% of the population of Hawaii. In this case, it is not just the tail that is wagging the dog, it is a few hairs on the tail that are wagging the dog. In a republic like America, the laws are controlled by the majority, and the majority are not in favor of this bill, as evidenced by their past actions. This bill represents a very serious change to the laws of Hawaii, more serious than any thing that has ever come before the legislature. Since the effects are so far reaching to all concerned, this should be decided by a proposal put before the people of Hawaii in the 2014 election. We strongly oppose Bill 1 of the Special Session of the Hawaii Legislature and strongly encourage you to vote NO on this bill and to support a proposal for the people of Hawaii to determine this in the 2014 election. Thank you Dale & Carol Hammond 55-705 Wahinepee StLaie, HIFrom: Dan Gubler To: Bill in Special Legislative Session Date: Thursday, October 24, 2013 9:10:44 PM Aloha, My name is Dan Gubler and I am a resident of Oahu, Hawaii. I am testifying on the state measure before the Senate on Marriage Equality. I am testifying in opposition to this bill. I have researched and compared Hawaii's marriage equality act to that of other states and find that Hawaii's is far too intrusive on the rights of independent organizations of faith. I myself attend a church that does not endorse same-gender marriages yet our clergy will be forced to perform them or face legal action. I feel that the freedom of worship how we please in our private church facilities is just as important as that of public accomodations, separate but equal. Please take into account what the majority of the people of Hawaii want when you consider this bill. I feel strongly that your voting public do not agree with the current version of this bill. Mahalo for your service.

I would like to voice my opposition to SB1 Relating to Equality. This is an important issue that should be taken up with a lot of time, thought and input from the people. This is how our democracy was meant to work. However, a special session treatsthe issue lightly in the sense that it is a rush job, and does not give ample consideration thatother bills receive in a regular session. This bill at the very least needs the full considerationthat a regular legislative session would provide. It is so important, it would even be better toput it on a ballot, and let the people decide directly. This is not a civil rights issue as the proponents say. It is about changing the definition of marriage. I have 2 grandsons, both innocent and beautiful little boys, not yet in school, but that is not far off. It is a horrible thought that someday if this bill passes, they could and probablywould be taught in school that same-sex relations are OK. It is wrong and clearly violatesnature. The picture of my grandsons sitting in class learning instructions about homosexualacts is very distressing. This is the future if this bill passes. It's already happening elsewhere.This is about the proper definition of marriage being between one man and one woman. It isabout our legacy of raising our families in a civil and moral society. Government has anobligation to the people to protect and maintain a society that is optimal for families andraising children. Changing the definition of marriage will cause this to decay. Government can still find a way to provide benefits to same-sex couples. The alteration of the definition of marriage is not necessary.Please protect our religious freedom. Most churches are open to public functions and events. Government should not force churches to marry same-sex couples against their religiousbeliefs nor force into law doctrine that is so against the traditions of our country.I urge you to stop this bill. Thank you so much for your time and consideration. Sincerely,Darryl D. WillisRegistered voter: Senate District 1 and House District 2. From: David Kammerer To: JDLTestimony-WrittenOnly Subject: Marriage Equality Act Date: Thursday, October 24, 2013 12:47:02 PM To whom it may concern, I am vehemently opposed to the proposed legislation contained in SB 1. It is clearly a case of legislative overreach, since all civil rights and legal protections ostensibly sought by same-sex couples are already provided in this state by the 2011 Civil Unions Law. I find it cowardly, cynical, and frankly shameful that consideration of the bill was relegated to a special session scheduled for the minimum five day span. Although I deplore our elected officials' machinations in caving to activists' demands to redefine marriage, I am most concerned about the sloppy and inadequate language protecting religious freedoms and freedoms of individual conscience. I hope you will collectively practice due diligence in reviewing the religious freedoms protection language of other same-sex marriage states with the intent of improving the language of SB 1. I am a constituent of Rep. Richard Fale's district and I am confident that he will represent my views on this subject. As I am also a constituent of Sen. Hee's district, please know that I will do everything in my power to convince fellow constituents to vote him out during his next reelection bid if he continues his blanket advocacy of this bill as it now stands. Aloha--David David M. Kammerer, Ph.D. Associate Professor of MusicChair, Department of Music Saturday, October 26, 2013 10:59:21 AM I am a registered voter on Alexander Street 96822. I am OPPOSE to this Same-Sex Marriage Bill for the following reasons: 1. The bill is considered UNCONSTITUTIONAL because it uses STATE LAW (Public Accommodations) to override CONSTITUTIONAL LAW (Freedom of Religion/Speech). 2. The bill is UNFAIR because it really LIMITS PROTECTION on FAITH ORGANIZATIONS. With the three stipulations that must be met, two are totally UNFAIR: Faith facilities must be used by membersonly (church is not exclusive and everyone knows this); Faith facilities must be used for Faith activities(and that is also not true, because churches are open to allow other activities to the public). Onecannot expect that this two conditions be met because Faith organizations help the public in whateverway it can throughout the years. 3. The bill is UNFAIR because it DOESN'T address FAITH INDIVIDUALS and even their BUSINESSES. Same-sex couples will be able to sue these people for not wanting to serve them. This is not a HATE ISSUE, but rather a decision to follow one's conscience based on his/her faith.This is RELIGIOUS FREEDOM and FREEDOM OF SPEECH. 4. The Special Session DOES NOT ALLOW for enough time to get all testimonies presented to the legislature; this includes outer island individuals or individuals who do not have access to computer.This is such a social-change issue that the people should be involved. 5. There is a RUSH on this issue and this should be AVOIDED. This is no longer a MARRIAGE issue but a FREEDOM OF RELIGION AND SPEECH issue. There should be more time to look at allFAIRNESS to both sides. This bill currently protects same-sex marriage couples only. 6. In all fairness, THE PEOPLE should have its say and VOTE on this issue. This is the only way to truly get a wide range of public opinion involved. Please remember that you represent THE PEOPLE. I urge you to make the right decision, and it is about FAIRNESS...providing more time to evaluate such an important topic and consider all aspects, ALL PEOPLE and ways of living. Our State Motto talks about the Life of the Land being perpetuated in Righteousness. So, lets do the Right thing and consider the FAIRNESS of this bill...because it is OBVIOUSLY NOT FAIR. Thank you for your genuine consideration on this matter. Please do not take Hawaii down that road of UNFAIRNESS...it will be demeaning to the people and soften our faith in our Legislators. David D. Ubaldo1417 Alexander Street #B-1Honolulu, Hawaii 96822From: Dawn OBrien To: JDLTestimony Testimony in Opposition to SB1 Relating to Equality Date: Sunday, October 27, 2013 8:33:46 AM Sent from Sent: Sun, Oct 27, 2013 5:50:27 PM Clayton Hee, Chair 10/28/13 Senate Committee on Judiciary and Labor Re: TESTIMONY IN OPPOSITION TO SB 1 RELATING TO EQUALITY Dear Honorable Chair Hee and Members of the Committee on Judiciary and Labor: As a concerned citizen, I am submitting testimony against this special session and the bill that would legalize same sex marriage. I oppose the special session because it rushes the legislative process and does not give we, the people, sufficient input into the process. I am pa rticularly concerned that the religious exemption clauses are so sparse. Priest, pastors and churches are exempted under only very limited circumstances. There is no exemption for religious organizations, charities or fraternal societies, nor are there any exemptions for individuals. I am concerned that my First Amendment rights be protected in the process. On a p ersonal note, my 7 -year old son shared his view on the same sex marriage bill; he stated: \"I wish they don't make it pass, because I do n't want to marry the same sex. \" His sharing really gripped my heart and sadden me to think at such a young age is tormented of legalizing \"same sex marriage\". How many children or let alone maybe even adults will be as bold to share their heart felt views. This bill would be robbing the innocence of our children, grandchildren and all future generations. With such an amendment, again, our freedom of rights under the First Amendment established by our founding forefathers of this great nation will no longer hold it's validity. Has our state government really studied the what the repercussions of passing this bill would have on our judiciary systems with many law suits to follow and the impact of all people now and future generations, and not just with one group ? The state of Massachusetts and Canada, who has passed this bill, has had many avoidable lawsuits, with the rights of innocent citizens living under the rights of the First Amendment, were purged and harassed for trying to defend themselves . Please, pleas e, please, do further research so that our freedoms will not be taken away and our children and future generations will live in righteousness as in our state motto: Ua Mau ke Ea o Ka Aina i ka Pono\" - \"The life of the land is perpetuated in righteousness\" and that it be sustained throughout time. Finally, since we voted a constitutional amendment in 1998 giving the legislature the power to limit marriage between opposite sex couples, the only legitimate way to change this is to let we, the people, decide. Please d o not circumvent the democratic process! Thank you for the opportunity to testify against this special session and against this bill. Dean K . HI 96703 SB 1 Testimony Dear Senators and Representatives, I recently wrote a letter to the editor of the Maui News, in which I pled the case to bring the issue of same gender marriage to a vote in a constitutional amendment, for the values of the people ought to be reflected in our laws. I have since reconsidered. Indeed, if something is right or wrong, it is right or wrong no matter what public opinion is. That being the case, then, just how might the citizens of this great State of Hawaii make a decision on what is right or wrong? The 19'Th century writer Hans Christian Andersen tells the tale of an emperor who was duped into believing that he was wearing a fancy suit. In reality, he was wearing nothing at all. In the end, a little boy pointed out the obvious. At the root of this issue before us is worldview, or paradigm. What are we, as human beings? Are we the result of a random process, a mere coincidence? If so, our laws would reflect whatever values seem right to us at the time. On the other hand, if we are created, and are accountable to our Creator, we w ould want our laws to be compatible with His desire. Years ago, Darwin published \"Origen of Species\". Before this, the worldview in western society was predominately Theistic. That is, there was recognition that there is a God, and that we are accountabl e to Him. After Darwin, this was called into question. 150 years later, Theism is openly mocked. Religion is placed into a subjective box, and is not allowed to speak in the public square. Someone once said that a lie, repeated often enough, will soon hav e the power of truth. Fellow citizens of Hawaii, I am here to be that little boy who points out the obvious: The emperor has no clothes! If we look deep into our hearts, in that secret place that we all fear, we all know that we are NOT the product of ra ndom chance. We might well aver otherwise publically, but privately, we know that humans are designed by a Creator to whom we will one day give account. Any honest evaluation of the forensic evidence will agree with this conclusion. As for whom that Creato r is, and what His expectation of us is, we have been given the Bible, a book for which there is copious evidence of Devine authorship. Because God has granted us freedom, we are free to choose not to believe, but our failure to believe will not change the facts. Marriage is not, and never will be, a human creation. God created us Male and Female, for the purpose of producing godly children. No human institution can ever change that fact. We would do well to openly acknowledge this.

Without boring you, my secondary point is to ask that you reserve any vote on the Same Sex Marriage Law. I deeply believe this issue is of such a tremendous social impact that it goes far beyond an abbreviated Special Session. It also goes beyond the scope of 77 people deciding for an entire state. I ask you to please done of two things: A. Leave the institution of marriage the way we the people defined it in 1998, when we the people were allowed the vote on it. B. Take the issue back to the citizens o f the State and allow us to vote for a clearly -worded constitutional amendment. Thank you for your time, consideration and aloha!

I am asking you to allow the people to decide on the issue of marriage asI believe the legislature is going against the will of the people. I supportequality for all including the rights of conscience and religious freedom,which I ask you to respect as our elected leaders. I am opposed to the most contentious social issue in our history beingdecided virtually in one week and ask that you please uphold theprinciples of democracy and the democratic process which are beingdisregarded in this special session. This bill should be given due process during the regular session where itcan properly be vetted and examined as all other bills. The people whoelected you to serve as their voices should have a say in public policy thatwill forever obliterate thousand of years of indigenous and non-nativeculture, customs and traditions. Your \"yes\" vote in special session isclearly a NO vote to democracy! I believe letting the people decide through a constitutional amendmentwould be fairer. Thank you for your attention. Diane OkadaHonolulu, HI 96826 H. Thom as Kay, Jr. Attorney at law COMMITTEE ON JUDICIARY AND LABOR Senator Clayton Hee, Chair Senator Maile S.L. Shimabukuro, Vice Chair Monday, October 28, 2013 10:30 a.m. State Capitol Auditorium My name is Tom Kay. I am a kama 'aina attorney . I strongly oppose enacting S.B. 1, the Hawaii Marriage Equality Act of 2013 in this Second Special Session of the Hawaii State Legislature. Such action will be unconstitutional unde r Article 1 \u00a7 23 of t he Hawaii Constitution. \u00a723 provides as follows: \"The legislature shall have power to reserve marriage to opposite sex couples.\" \u00a723 was enacted by the legislature in 1997 as an amendment to the Hawaii Constitution and ratified by 69.2 percent of the voters in 1998. The sole purpose of this constitutional amendment was to reverse the Hawaii Supreme Court decision in the Baehr v. Lewin case in which the court had held that same -sex marriages in Hawaii were constitutional. Following the pa ssage of \u00a723 the Hawaii Supreme Court held, in an unreported decision, that the \u00a7 23 constitutional marriage amendment validated HRS \u00a7 572-1 which states that marriage can only be between one man and one woman. To the 285,671 Hawa ii voters out of 412,820 who cast votes in 1998 , this meant that by reading constitutional amendment \u00a7 23 along with the language of HRS \u00a7 572-1 there could be no legal marriages of same -sex couples in Hawaii. It also means to the voters today including those of the 285,671 voters still li ving in Hawaii that any consideration of legalizing marriage of same -sex couples must r equire an amendment to \u00a7 23 of the Ha waii Constitution by a vote of the people of Hawaii. If the Hawaii Legislature in this special session passes the Hawaii M arriage Equ ality Act two inevitable events will occur: 1. Litigation in both federal and state court s will continue for many years to det ermine whether the Marriage Act is constitutional before it is ever implemented. 2. There will be an extremely large group of angry Hawaii voters whose right to vote on this major issue was abrogated by current legislators. The obvious solution to this dilemma is to let the Ha waii voters decide on whether sam e-sex couples should be allowed to marry under Hawaii law. From: Don Hughes To: JDLTestimony-WrittenOnly Subject: Gay marriage Date: Friday, October 25, 2013 10:58:28 AM I am against same sex marriage. It seems that the thought is to get insurance coverage. If that is the case there must be other ways. Marriage is a sacred act and tradition which must be respected.Aloha Legislators, I am writing in opposition to the proposed same sex marriage bill. I want to have a right to say what is being taught in public schools. I want to have a right to remove my children from a school that teaches curriculum that is contrary to my beliefs. I want to have a right, as a teacher, to oppose curriculum that is contrary to my beliefs. I want to take my children to church and not have to fear persecution. Please vote NO. Mahalo, Dona Ahuna From: Don Young To: JDLTestimony Subject: Re: in Opposition to SB 1 Relating to Equality Date: Saturday, October 26, 2013 8:08:47 PM Donald Young 909 Kahauloa PlaceHonolulu, HI 96825 Clayton Hee, Chair Senate Committee on Judiciary and Labor Re: TESTIMONY IN OPPOSITION TO SB 1 RELATING TO EQUALITY Dear Honorable Chair and Members of the Committee on Judiciary and Labor: My name is Don Young --- and I vote! This question before us has been addressed before. In different forms - but, it's really the same issue. Sometimes it's difficult to sort out the details of what happened some years ago, reconcile them with the question that's now before us, & then - most of all - try to project just how our decisions will affect our future. I, for one, find it disturbing that on an issue which will prove to have far-reaching implications over time, we have had so little opportunity for public input from the voting population. A few years back, under conditions of extreme noise & pressure (a lot of itfrom mainland people who came to \"help\" us out), Hawaii's Civil Union law was enacted in 2011, effective as of January 1, 2012. The rationale was to provide equal State benefits for same-sex partners as were available to heterosexual couples . Sounds, fair enough - but that wasn't the end of it. As of May 2013, only 916 people in Hawaii have taken advantage of civil unions - that's a total of1832 people - less than 2/10ths of 1% of our total population. Not a very big number - so something else has to be afoot. And it is - less than 2 years later. We're now being asked to change the more-than-2000-year old definition oftraditional marriage. The reason? - to qualify same-sex couples for Federal benefits , which are denied those in a civil union. But, the wording on this bill has a lot of excess baggage that infringes on our religious freedoms. To top it off, it's not necessary to rush to a decision on this bill, because it's purpose is to provide something already available to same-sex couples. Currently, they can obtain the status of \"legally\" married by taking a quick round-trip flight toCalifornia or Washington State to tie the knot. Problem solved, right? Not really, because that's not the real agenda of this whole exercise: whichis to change our culture, traditions, & even religious beliefs. Hawaii is not the firstto be led down this path - just look at Mass. & Canada. What evolved in those places is in store for us. The path we're being led down includes infringement onour religious beliefs & practices (the mission of churches will be severely limitedif they're deemed to be public accommodations), massive changes to our educational system (from SSM recognition, to promotion, & to indoctrination); &curtailing freedom of speech (where Bible verses will be viewed as hate speech). Those of you who attended last Wednesday evening's meeting were briefedon just what is in store for Hawaii if we pass this bill. You say it will never happenin Hawaii - but that's just what they said in Mass. & Canada. As I stated before, there's no need to pass this bill, never mind rush it through a special session. Please let the people decide the fate of traditional marriage. -- Thank you. From: Leonard Mukai To: JDLTestimony Subject: Senate Bill 1 Date: Friday, October 25, 2013 10:32:05 AM Dear Honorable Chair Hee and Members of the Committee on Judiciary and Labor: I am against legalizing same sex marriage in Hawaii and encourage you to allow the people of Hawaii to decide this important issue.

Do NOT support same-sex marriage. Our ancestors got us here because they were family oriented. They would roll over in their grave if they could even fathom how far we have digressed from the basic moral values of traditional marriage.

Dr. Patrick MacyFrom: Dylan Payne To: JDLTestimony Subject: testimony in opposition to SB 1 relating to equality Date: Sunday, October 27, 2013 10:29:45 AM Senator Hee, I am writing to voice my opposition to SB 1: Relating to equality. I strongly believe that marriage should be defined as being between a man and a woman and that compromisingthis institution will have dire effects on the moral fiber and society of our great State. I dobelieve that same sex couples should be afforded the same rights and benefits as heterosexualcouples, but same sex unions should not be called marriage. Thank you for considering my testimony. I hope that the legislature listens to the voice of the people. Aloha, Dylan Payne(808) 276-6881Lahaina, Maui HIFrom: Elisa Nakamura To: JDLTestimony Subject: Testimony in Opposition to SB 1 Relating to Equality Date: Sunday, October 27, 2013 9:53:41 AM To: Clayton Hee, Chair Senate Committee on Judiciary and Labor From: Elisa Nakamura, Wahiawa Dear Honorable Chair Hee and Members of the Committee on Judiciary and Labor: Please vote NOT to pass Senate Bill No. 1 Relating to Equality. I submit to you that: I. This bill is a violation of process. The people gave the Legislature the right to define marriage as between a man and a woman. If my kids come to me and ask me if they can label our mailbox with \"Nakamura\" they will be in trouble if they go and paint \"Bananapants\" on it instead. By giving them authority to label \"Nakamura\" I have not given them authority to change that label. We, the people of Hawaii, did not give you, the Legistlature, the authority to change the definition of marriage. As such, this bill is in direct opposition to the voted on and clear views of the people of Hawaii. II. The issue of same sex marriage is three different very separate issues. One the one hand it is a word issue. On the other it is a financial issue. The third is a moral issue. The word issue: The word marriage has long been the label applied to the union between a man and woman or a man and other women. It has never been a label that meant anything else. Homosexual relations have existed since ancient times and across most cultures, but there has always been a different name for that relationship than the one that exists between a man and woman (or women). If the purpose of redefining the word marriage is to give financial rights to those who are in a homosexual committed relationship, then why not give those rights and create a word that means committed homosexual relationship? Your authority under the law is not to rewrite the dictionary is it? The financial issue: To this issue I would pose a question: Why does what I do with my physical body suddenly give me certain rights that I could not get if I did not perform those actions? If I am a woman living with anyone else and I agree to keep the house and do all the home work while she/she goes and gets a job, why should I have to marry that woman in order to receive the same monetary benefits of a married couple? In essence you are legislating that depending upon what I do behind closed doors, you will allow me to share financial obligations with another person. Making homosexuality or heterosexuality the basis for financial advantage is ridiculous. Why does what I do in the bedroom entitle me to financial advantages? That line of logic does not make sense. Instead let us back up and remember the reason these financial reasons were there in the first place, define them. From there we can decide whether those reasons are still valid and to whom they apply. The moral issue: The actual effects of this bill, as proven over and over in the United States today, will be to allow the people you are trying to give \"rights to\", to sue another person for living by the truths dictated by the same Creator that defined my inalienable rights. One only has to look in the news to see that the main impact is to put people out of business who don't agree with what other people are doing behind the bedroom doors. The Creator endowed us with the inalienable right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Those inalienable rights do NOT include the right to dictate morals to anyone else. In essence, if you pass this bill, whether you intend to allow others to use it to sue someone out of business or not - you cannot deny that this is exactly what many good citizens have already done in our country. You are dictating the morals. That is not one of your or my inalienable rights. I would like to thank you for your attention as well as your service, diligence and hard work. October 23, 2013 5:07:19 PM October 23, 2013 To Whom It May Concern, I am writing in regards to the same-sex marriage bill. I am asking as a voter that you, as my representative will hear my voice and represent me and what I believe. I am asking that you would vote \"No\" on the same-sex marriage bill because it violates our democratic rights as citizens of the United States of America. We the people of the United States have been blessed abundantly with freedoms that many countries only dream of having. Among those are the freedoms of speech and of religion. If the same-sex marriage bill is passed, those freedoms that we hold hold dear will be stripped away without our voices being heard. I am asking that you vote \"No\" to the same-sex marriage bill to protect our freedom of speech. With the bill quickly being pushed through the special session, Hawaii's people are not being given the opportunity to weigh in their opinions. We the people, want to have a voice in such a huge, fundamental shift in our state, in our schools, in our churches, and in our society. The special session is denying us those rights and freedoms that our forefathers fought so hard to grant our country with. Please also take into consideration that Hawaii is the only state rushing into the special session as a result of the Supreme Court decision. If this is truly a dire need, why haven't the other 34 states that do not permit same-sex marriage done so as well? Is a 5 day session really enough time to discuss, clarify, and put into law one of the most controversial issues that we face today? My church currently meets in a public school. If this bill is passed, we would be legally obligated to sanction a same-sex marriage if it was requested, even though our faith does not support this. I ask that you would represent not only a portion of the people of Hawaii, but all of us. Please be my voice and also speak out for those of us who's freedoms\u2014that this country was founded on\u2014are being dismissed. Thank you for taking time out of your day to hear my voice, but please don't just dismiss what I have brought before you. Please represent me and the people of Hawaii and what we believe.

I believe that same-sex marriage is not natural, right, nor salubrious on either the individual level or the society level. I believe marriage between a man and a woman is ordained of God, and study after study has shown overwhelmingly that the traditional family (wife, husband, children) is better for the children and for society's structure in general.October 24, 2013 TO: The State of Hawaii Honorable Governor Abercrombie Members of the House of Representatives Members of the Senate RE: Special Legislative Session SB1 As elected officials of the State of Hawaii, I sincerely appeal to you all that you VOTE NO on Senate Bill 1 in regards to allowing Same -Sex Marriage in the State of Hawaii. I am adamantly opposed to the passage of this Bill. As an educator with the Department of Education for over 20 years, I believe that I have the democra tic right to determine what is taught in regards to character education and the curriculum in the classroom. I should be allowed the freedom to choose materials pertain to what I teach which is not to be decided upon by a certain segment of society. I have the right to Academic Freedom and my right to do so will be impinged upon if I am forced to teach sexuality in the classroom and Same Sex Marriage to children. Allowing Same Sex marriage will affect the educational system and will dictate that I te ach sexuality in the classroom, attend workshops and trainings which I believe are solely the responsibility of the parents. Passage of this bill violates my rights as an educator and my rights to Academic Freedom. For the Sake of our children, Vote N O on Senate Bill 1.

However, by passing this bill there will be extreme serious, and disturbing and possible irreversible damages that will impact every single person in Hawaii, especially if this bill becomes a law without any type of amendments. I am even questioning whether 5 days will allow for changes to be proposed and agreed upon. If this bill becomes law, it will discriminate those that run religious organizations because most of the churches will not be exempt under the current language of the bill if they refuse to officiate marriages. They will be in violation of this new law and will be forced to go to court to fight for their Constitutional rights which the Supreme Law of the Land says, and I quote \" Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof, or abridging the freedom of speech...\" Religious sectors will deemed \"discriminatory\" and will be \"forced\" to comply under this new law, even though this Bill appears to address the protection of these organizations under section 572-G, but in fact, it deceives the public to believe that religious organizations will be protected. Another group of citizens that this Bill will affect: the educators, the parents of children and children of all ages. There are reports already that indicate actual impacts in the states that have legalized same-sex marriages, and there are also potential negative ramifications involved once at a state passes a law to legalize same-sex marriages. There has been reports in different parts of the nation and in our neighboring country that speeches by teachers, students, and counselors have been increasingly being censored and there has been drastic altering of the children's curriculum which includes very graphic materials that the teachers will be forced to teach and finally, schools will be REQUIRED (forced) to be assisted by GLSEN organization to form Gay/Straight Alliances /clubs on campus. Reports indicate that parents will not have a say in what will be taught to their children, and given, in fact no notice will not be given to parents or to opt out. LGBT (lesbian , gay,bisexual , and transgender ) teachings (indoctrination) will also be introduced. Private and religious schools will eventually have no say and will also be forced to comply. Well-qualified school counselors, administrators, and teachers refusing to comply will be fired or disciplined/suspended. These new curriculum will promote acceptance and normalization of these behaviors and will be under the disguise of anti-bullying or \"discriminatory harassment.\" Parents will not have a say and may even be imprisoned for expressing their views and requesting for opting out their children when these lessons are taught. I work in the schools where this will possibly take place once this bill becomes law and it will definitely impact all the teachers I work with, the children I see everyday and each of those parents that pick up their children from school. I, myself, will have to rethink about my employment in the education system. Please seriously consider these potential ramifications for every person in this state that you personally made a choice to affect should you support this Bill. I would like you to consider killing this bill since there are current measures that are being considered for the regular sessions. At that time, a more fair consideration for the rest of the residents of Hawaii can be considered and that all voices can be heard to develop a more thoughtful and constitutional-based bill can be introduced. Thank you for your kind consideration of this most important piece of legislation.

I am asking that you would let the people of Hawaii decide on this issue of marriage. I believe that this special session does not give the people of Hawaii the opportunity to let their voice be heard on this issue. I am a young adult and am writing this because I am concerned about my future keiki and what they will be learning in their public school curriculum if this same sexmarriage bill is passed. I am getting married in December and am looking forward to having children and raising them the way I believe is correct. However, if this bill ispassed, the public school system will enforce curriculum that I do not agree with. There are documented incidences where parents are harassed because they have a difficult time with the curriculum that their children are being subjected to. Hawaii's public school system will change, Governor Abercrombie has assured us of this. My fianc\u00e9 is a teacher and I am a case manager. We will not have the financial freedoms to pay for a private school education for our future children so that they canbe exempt from the promotion of homosexual relationships. I also will not have theability to home school my children, as I need to provide financially as well. As you can see, this is an extremely important issue that will have dramatic effects. More time is needed for further discussion of this bill. The determination of this bill is being rushed into a one-week decision, while the institution of traditional marriage has been around for thousands of years. Please give us, the people of Hawaii, thechance and time to have a say in this bill. Thank you for the opportunity to testify. Emily Maeda(Honolulu, HI 96822) From: Emmons Connell To: JDLTestimony Subject: Hawaii Marriage Equality Act of 2013 Date: Saturday, October 26, 2013 6:41:17 PM Dear Legislators, God is love. God wants ALL people to come to Him in faith and believe that His Son Jesus Christ isthe Savior of all the world. Once God's Holy Spirit works in your heart to repent and believe this, youbecome one of his children. Out of thankfulness you do what God, who is a just God, wants you to do,as in, follow His rules joyfully. God's rules become your rules.The bill as read condones homosexual acts in direct opposition to God's rules! How can I go against my God? Please vote NO on Same Sex Marriage.Thanks for your time and attention. Emmons and Mary Same Sex Marriage Date: Friday, October 25, 2013 10:54:49 AM I would like to express my opinion regarding this up coming special session regarding the issue of same sex marriage. I would like to ask you to oppose the legalization of same sex marriage in the state of Hawaii for the following reasons: 1) It's not natural 2) The destruction of the family. a. Same sex marriage does not produce children b. Same sex marriage purposes is not an equality issue, it is a moral and physical issue.c. Same sex marriage is selfish for its own intent and purpose not thinking about the future of the world. 3) Creates the loss of freedom to choose for the people. a. Religion b. Education c. Welfare I have listed what I believe to be core purposes of my belief and many others through out our state. I plead for your attention and ask for your support to reject this proposal to legalize same sex marriage in our state of Hawaii. For the sake of my children, grandchildren and posterity to follow. Regards, Eric K. Keawe 2283 Tantalus DriveHonolulu, 96813 Papakolea To: JDLTestimony Subject: Opposition to SB1 Date: Sunday, October 27, 2013 9:40:32 AM To: Senate Committee on Judiciary and Labor Hearing Date/Time: Monday, October 28, 2013, 10:30 a.m. Place: Capitol Auditorium Re: Strong Opposition of SB1 Dear Chair Hee and Members of the Committee on Judiciary and Labor: I am writing to voice my opposition to Bill SB1. I am asking you to allow the people to decide on the issue of marriage as I believe the legislature is going against the will of the people. I support equality for all including the rights of conscience and religious freedom, which I ask you to respect as our elected leaders. I am opposed to this being decided virtually in one week and ask that you please uphold the principles of democracy and the democratic process which are being disregarded in this special session. This bill should be given due process during the regular session where it can properly be vetted and examined as all other bills. Thank you for the opportunity to testify. Eric-Jon Keawe Marlowe October 27, 2013 10:29:27 AM Aloha, I would testify in person, but I am unable to make it to Honolulu during the special session because of its limited and exclusive nature. I am extremely concerned about the bill up for review attempting to redefine marriage in Hawai'i. In an effort to bring marital rights to parties, this piece bill is completely inadequate to maintain religious freedom here in Hawai'i. You cannot successful support equality by promoting the rights of one group (gays) and cutting off the rights of another (religious institutions). Please, vote NO on this piece of legislation! Please, at the least, re-word the bill to protect religious freedom. It is not fair to require all religious leaders and buildings to be available to perform same-sex marriages with impending fines accompanying dis-action. That will force hundreds of residents to act against their personal beliefs, affecting their spirituality and their relationships with God and the community. We should ALL be able to participate in and uphold marriage in the ways that we see fit. Religious institutions should be able to perform marriages by their own leaders in their own buildings for their followers in the manner that they see proper and correct. No one else, regardless or religious affiliation or sexual orientation or political stance, should be allowed to infringe upon the constitutional right of religious freedom, which was one of the major proponents of the establishment of the American country. EVERYONE deserves to live peaceful lives where they are protected and respected. Please, consider the lives and rights off ALL of your state's residents before approving a bill which, in its current wording, will severely affect and damage the lives of many people in Hawai'i. The definition of marriage is essential to the beliefs of many religions and people of faith. If marriage is legally redefined to include same-sex couples, enormous legal and social pressure will mount against churches and religious people who believe in the traditional definition of marriage. I am one of these people. I have had a variety of gay friends throughout my life. Although I don't agree with their lifestyle, I still respect them and love them. And they have shown me the same courtesy. We are able to form relationships beyond our societal opinions. We both are entitled to our opinions and have the right to belief and live in ways that we see fit. I expect that same courtesy from my government! Bill SB1 is not by or for the people! Schools will teach children the new definition of marriage and correct or ostracize children who openly disagree based on their family's religious beliefs. Lawsuits will be brought against individuals, small businesses, marriage counselors, and even some churches and their related organizations (including educational and charitable institutions) that refuse to support same-sex marriages on religious conscience grounds. Religious groups that provide family- related services, such as adoption, will be stripped of their State licenses for being unwilling to treat same-sex marriages as equal to traditional marriages. Society will increasingly view and treat those who support traditional marriage for religious reasons as bigoted or ignorant. Please, protect me as you strive to protect my homosexual brothers and sisters. We ALL deserve it! October 25, 2013 5:34:46 PM Testimony of Estrelita T. CASTRO I am a registered voter of the State of Hawaii, a mother, a grandmother, a Christian, a law abiding citizen of this state andthe United States of America. I am here because: Number 1) I am deeply concerned about the ramification of this gay-rights bill or any similar legislation that forces ordinarycitizens to become criminals if they refuse to obey orders that goagainst their moral principles. Records show states and countries where gay-rights bill are implemented, many of their ordinary citizens have been fined and criminalized when they have triedto stay within their personal beliefs and refuse to obey laws thatgo contrary to their conscience. Number 2) I am concerned about the legacy our generation leaves behind for the keikis of these islands, this beautiful stateof ours, as well as the whole United States of America. It is notabout us, it is about the generation we leave behind. Keikis have the right to be protected and shielded. We do not have to have sex taught them at and early age as early as kindergarten. Wewere not robbed of our childhood innocence. The generationbefore us assured us of that. Who are we to do rob our grandchildren of the same safety precautions our parents and grandparents gave us? As members of the legislature you were voted in to represent the ordinary people of these islands. I also think you are to protect the rights of our mo'opunas as well. Most of you remember your childhood because our schools wereso different then. We respected our parents, the flag, ourcountry. Those are legacies that are being eroded by thiscancerous idea that gays have rights that take precedence over the rights of our children. OUR CHILDREN comes first before their rights. OUR CHILDREN are not 3rd class citizens that theyare to be put in harms way. I am deeply concerned that my grandchildren will have to leave in fear of pedophiles who have as I speak are trying to pushlegislation to protect their sexual preferences. It is unconscionable that you would not protect our children andprotect pedophiles. Please ladies and gentlemen, I beg of you protect our children.Do what is PONO!

Please know that I will not vote for anyone who votes for this bill. Faith Wright Voter!!!! Sent from my iPadFrom: Farina McCarthy-Stonex To: JDLTestimony-WrittenOnly Subject: To the Committee on Judiciary and Labor (Related to Equal Rights) Date: Friday, October 25, 2013 9:52:30 AM Dear Sir, I wish to testify that marriage is ordained of God and that marriage is between a man and a woman. This country was founded on religious principles that believed in the sanctity of marriage. I am taking this opportunity to have my voice heard too. The current language in the new Senate draft bill does not grant adequate protections against lawsuits and other litigation for religious entities and their followers. This bill does not protect organizations related to or controlled by religious organizations, nor does it protect such organizations with respect to the celebrations or promotions of marriage against their religious beliefs. Furthermore, Religious groups must continue to have the freedom to choose how their facilities and buildings may be used, and that they should not come under or enforced to be under \"public\" facility. Churches offer shelter to the poor and needy and sustain our citizens in their time of need through sermon, support and love. For the Governor to introduce legislature without allowing the people to vote and voice their opinion is unfair. e. g. (According to Governor Abercrombie's FAQ on his website, this bill was \"based on a bill that was introduced in the Legislature this past session (S.B. No. 1369), which has been updated.\" SB 1360 did not receive a single hearing during standard session. Also the Governor has set this special session at a minimum amount of days allowed by law. As a result, there will be only one hearing for the House and Senate each for people to testify. It severely limits the general public the opportunity to voice their concerns. After the passing of the 1996 Defense Against Marriage Act, Hawaii adopted a Constitutional Amendment in 1998 that gave the legislature power to reserve marriage as between a man and a woman. For an issue that would impact so many people, organizations and culture it is important to let the people decide. Sincerely, Farina McCarthy-Stonex From: Mom To: JDLTestimony-WrittenOnly Subject: Special Session - Gay Marriage Bill Date: Wednesday, October 23, 2013 11:01:26 PM I was born and raised in Hawaii and am 66 years old. I want you to know that I and my family are AGAINST you approving this bill. The people of Hawaii has already spoken and voted back in 1998 that MARRIAGE SHOULD BE BETWEEN ONE AND ONE WOMAN! I believe that what the Governor has done and what some of those in the legislature intend to do does not take the majority of Hawaii's citizens and our voices into consideration, but you are only considering YOUR OWN PERSONAL preferences/choices. May God, Who created the heavens and the earth, HELP US! The PEOPLE OF HAWAII VOTED each one of you into office to REPRESENT US, THE PEOPLE OF HAWAII! TRUTHFULLY, are you representing the majority of Hawaii's people when you are voting for this bill? I have read the repercussions that's now affecting the State of Massachusetts. I am asking you to NOT pass this bill until you have made your studies as to how the passing of this bill will affect our citizens, churches, businesses and most of all, our children. Please...

Reasons for my opposition: 1. It violates what I believe that God's law is the highest law in the land and it clearly states that marriage is between a man and a woman. 2. Although we don't have children, I am concern of the welfare and moral values of children of this generation and of the generations to come. Passing of this bill would cause instability and deterioration of families due to mixed-liberal teachings taught and instilled in young minds not knowing any better which would cause confusion and chaos in families and trigger an automatic negative effect in Hawaii. 3. This bill does not protect small business owners rights/freedom of choice due to conscious sake to be able to refuse to provide same-sex marriage services without the fear of losing their businesses. 4. This bill does not protect State/Government workers rights/freedom of choice due to conscious sake to be able to refuse to provide same-sex marriage services without the fear of losing their jobs. 5. This bill does not protect teachers rights/freedom of choice due to conscious sake to refuse to teach students related topics of same-sex marriage without the fear of losing their jobs. Since this is a highly sensitive and controversial bill, I plead with you: LET THE VOTERS/PEOPLE of HAWAII VOTE ON IT, NOT THE LEGISLATORS . Our unified goal should be what would be best for the people of Hawaii, and not copycat or to be like other states. So please sow what would be best for the people so that our today and tomorrows will be a harvest of 'PONO'. Thank you!

Ken Ito Subject: *****SPAM***** TESTIMONY IN OPPOSITION TO SB 1 RELATING TO EQUALITY Date: Friday, October 25, 2013 11:36:00 AM Aloha: As a 30+ year resident of Hawaii and community influencer, I am deeply concerned about the unintended outcomes that have historically followed such legislation in other states. I am sure that those who have proposed this legislation have done so with the best of intentions, but in an attempt to provide a remedy for a miniscule percentage of people in Hawaii they are potentially imposing massive burdens upon the overwhelming majority of us.I am writing to express my strong opposition to SB 1 for the following reasons:(1) Any legal and/or financial inequities remaining since the passing of the Civil Unions bill can easily be addressed by amendments to that law WITHOUT redefining marriage.(2) This is a divisive issue that should be decided by a plebiscite, not by political maneuvering.(3) In attempting to provide some measure of protection for religious groups who have moral and theological objections to same-gender marriage the State of Hawaii is overstepping its Constitutional authority \u2014 the alleged protections for churches state that. \" unless a religious organization allows use of its facilities or grounds by the general public for weddings for a profit, such organization shall not be required to make its facilities or grounds available for solemnization of any marriage celebration .\" That wording puts the State in the untenable position of defining who/what constitutes a church, and is based upon endorsement of a single understanding of church that does not reflect the latest scholarship and 21st Century church models. I am both a Pastor and Presiding Bishop for my church denomination in Hawaii and the Republic of Kiribati. I earned a Masters degree in Global Leadership from Fuller Theological Seminary, and my definition of church includes both the \" church assembled\" (the weekly gatherings of believers we typically call 'going to church', in which citizens sing and pray together, encourage one another and learn about their faith), which leads to the ' church dispersed'' \u2014 the individual members of the church living out their faith in their political decisions, business ethics and personal relationships in their everyday lives. The CHURCH DISPERSED is individual, personal and every bit as much 'the church' as the church assembled, yet the proposed law provides NO protection for the church dispersed, and little protection for the church assembled. A local florist, baker, photographer or other service provider who is a devout believer is, in fact, the CHURCH DISPERSED and is provided NO legal protection from being forced to violate their deeply held moral and theological stand against same-gender marriage, and they will be forced into situations that will clearly be a violation of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, which prohibits the federal government from making a law \"respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof\". The Hawaii State Constitution mirrors that: No law shall be enacted respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof... Any State law \"prohibiting the free exercise\" of a person's faith as part of the church dispersed is inherently unconstitutional. The state clearly has no understanding of contemporary missional church models and bases their understanding only upon models like the Roman Catholic, a highly hierarchal, institutional church.Respectfully,Gary R. Langley Presiding BishopChurch of God of ProphecyHawai'i and the Republic of Kiribati Kamehameha Kona, 96740 October 25, 2013 Honorable Senators and Representatives 27thLegislature 2013 Hawaii State Capitol 415 S Beretania Street Honolulu, HI 96813 Ref: Testimony Opposed to SB1 - Marriage Equity Dear Sirs and Madame's: Thank you for taking time to review my testimony. There are two issues that most concern me with the Marriage Equity SB1: 1. The current language in SB1 is ambiguous and unclear insofar as guaranteed protection for the church to express their religious freedom in their right to refuse to solemnize marriage of the same sex. Specifically, the language contained in 572-G (C) appears to contradict what is stated in 572-F through 572-G (b). The purpose of legalizing same sex marriage is to afford this people group access to the benefits, rights and dignity afforded to marriages of the opposite sex. What then becomes of the generations of believers who gather to express their own religious freedom? For example, I believe marriage is between one man and one woman and I belong to a religious sect who fosters the same belief. Why then would our faith and pastor be penalized for refusing to solemnize a same sex marriage? Where is the expression of freedom for what the church believes? It would appear the 5.1% GBLT population in the State of Hawaii by the standard above would enjoy greater civil rights than the church. Protection of the church and its right to celebrate religious freedom without fear of penalty, legal challenges or persecution is paramount.2. The second pressing issue is the future effect of Marriage Equity in Hawaii nine years down the road or fast forward to 2022. Certainly not many living in Massachusetts in 2004 could envision the effect of legalizing same sex marriage would have on public schools, health and hospitals, the court system, law enforcement, public access etc. The broad brush of the civil rights act empowered by the legalization of same sex marriage impacted the way of life in Massachusetts for children, adults, businesses and beyond. Attached is a commentary by Brian Camenker as to the Massachusetts experience since same sex marriage was legalized in 2004. I pray you will take time to read his commentary and then ask yourself if this is the future you envisioned for your keiki, grand keiki or great grand keiki. Is this the hostility you want for our Hawaii? At what age is innocence lost? Is it the age when the DOE force feeds our keiki homosexuality is normal? Or is it the age when our keiki are forced to learn in school about oral and anal sex or sex toys used to gratify their partner? I am certain there are good and decent GBLT citizens who will respect and aloha the rights of others. But, there exists the fringe element in any society who will use the legalization of same sex marriage to work the civil rights angle for their own selfish motives. My plea is simple, 1) let the people vote; 2) search your heart is this really the legacy the 2013 Legislature wants to leave for the future keiki o ka aina; and 3) where will the money come from to implement the many challenges our State will face when same sex marriage is legalized?

I stand today opposed to this bill and its so-called marriage equality, to give the rights to those of same sex gender to marry is one thing but to take the rights of others is another thing, your SB 1 gives no protection to faith based business, churches or facilities, that if this bill passes,\"as is,\" then churches, local faith based business and facilities will be targeted by those who oppose our belief. We are asked to accept their sexual preferences but when we stand up for our faith and morals we are cussed at, namecalled, and worse sued for discrimination and our First Amendment Rights are thrown out as if they never existed, Ithought that this was America a country built upon Faith. All I ask is that you consider revisiting the exemptions listed for the protection of faith based facilities and groundsas well as small businesses, to call this bill equal or equality, then it better balance out for ALL the people who callHawaii home, not just a few, for less then 916 civil unions couples, as of 2 years ago when Governor Abercrombiesigned it into law, are living in Hawaii out of 1.4 million people, so less then 1/5 of 1% of the people who live inHawaii will benefit from this bill, while those of us who are of faith must defend our business, churches andfacilities from being put out of service, a service that benefits the communities in which they operate. I find it ratherdisgusting to think that our Hawaii has come to this, that our culture has shifted so badly that we who call Hawaiihome will feel imprisoned once again, to accept someone else's sexual preference when they are not willing toaccept my freedom to live my life with the faith I have in Jesus Christ, this just no can. In closing, I ask that you would take a look at what's happening in the other states that have passed this type of bill, for ours is the worse one written in regards to religious exemptions for pastors and clergy, for churches and theirgrounds, for facilities and small businesses, not to mention the effect it will have on our keiki of Hawaii if this bill passes and there is no protection as to what is taught in the public schools. I hope that you, as our Representatives and Senators, would slow it down long enough to really listen to the people and make the right choices that wouldbenefit ALL of the people of Hawaii, not just a few, and if that's not possible then put it on the ballot and let thepeople vote!

I would not wish to be in your shoes as you have a heavy burden to weigh and appreciate all that you do! Although we don't agree at times I respect the office and know that this was the will of the people as the majority voted in favor of electing you andas an elected official you know that it should always be the will of the people. At this time I wish to express my complete dissatisfaction on the upcoming Special Session that the Governor has called for on same Sex marriage. The bottom line is this: why does Governor Neil Abercrombie feel that something as critical as this would bedecided without giving the people a chance to vote? Why should our right to vote be taken away? Why does the Governor think that this is something that the people should have no choice with or given no choice to express our voices? His answers to these questions were posted online and I had a chance to review his answers. I do not believe that there is complete truth to everything that he said in those answers and frankly I do noteven know if he even answered the questions that were being asked. All I am asking is a chance to use my vote as it is my right as a citizen of this state and of this country. Many have given their very lives to preserve these rights for all of us and now Neil Abercrombiebelieves he can change all of that in five days? It is wrong. .it is deceitful..it is manipulative. .and it is unconstitutional. I ask that you take my testimony intoconsideration and the testimony of thousands of others who share the same thoughts. I am extremely concerned if this bill passes, of the detrimental ramifications this will cause. And the ripple effect will be greater than you or I can imagine. .even long after you and Iare gone. This will hinder generations to come and the Hawaii that you and I were raised in and have grown to love will be gone forever and your posterity will have nobody but usto thank. Please take these testimonies into consideration as you make your decision in this very critical matter. May God guide you to do what is right. Respectfully, Herbert R.

I concern over the physical, mental and emotional problems that will beset those who choose the homosexual lifestyle, and I object to what this wi ll do to our community, my children and to my traditional family life. Evidence clearly show that children must be raised in a traditional family environment to thrive and to grow. In addition, legalizing Same Sex Marriage will have a negative effect on the liberties of religious freedom, as it relates to what the Bible holds as God's Truth and Christians' freedom to teach from it. Government should never define moral value and limit the teachings of faith group. Legalizing Same Sex Marriage will put a threat to religious freedom. Therefore, please vote NO on any piece of the Same Sex Marriage bill! From: Ivy Stiefvater To: JDLTestimony-WrittenOnly Subject: Opposing Senate Bill 1 Date: Thursday, October 24, 2013 7:51:41 PM To Senator Clayton Hee, Chair Committee on Judiciary and Labor: My name is Ivy Stiefvater and I oppose the Senate Bill 1. I am against this Bill because it is against my beliefs. I am opposed to the concept of same sex marriage. I believe that marriage should only be between a man and a woman. We are heading toward Soddom and Gomorrah and I do not want my son to grow up in such an environment.

I'm native Hawaiian and I oppose same-sex marriage. I find it troubling that the voices of the people of Hawaii are not being heard, instead outsiders from the mainland are greatly influencing our governing officials.This is not about our local families or people of our state who choose this lifestyle. This is about an outside organization that is literally bullying it's way into our islands through the influencing of our government, forcing usto accept same-sex marriage as normal. And because of this law, schools will be teaching that this is a normallifestyle going against everything I believe, and causing so much confusion. In 1998 the people voted yes to traditional marriage. The way it was worded gave us only two options: either wewere for SSM, or if we were against it we would allow the legislature to redefine it at a later date. Since it waswritten on the ballot this way, the people decided on the lesser of two evils. All of you were elected by the people to be our voice. Something of this magnitude shouldn't be decided by 52 people. Put it to a vote and let the people decide. Thank you for the opportunity to testify.Jacob Chung 98-1453 F Kaahumanu francoj001@hawaii.rr.com Subject: TESTIMONY IN OPPOSITION TO SB 1 RELATING TO EQUALITY Date: Saturday, October 26, 2013 9:45:21 PM Dear Honorable Chair Hee and Members of the Committee on Judiciary and Labor: I wish to express my complete dissatisfaction on the upcoming Special Session that the Governor has called fo on same Sex marriage. The bottom line is this: why does Neil Abercrombie feel that something as critical as this would be decided without giving thepeople a chance to vote? Why should our right to vote be taken away? Why does the Governor think that this is something that the people should have no choice with or given nochoice to express our voices? His answers to these questions were posted online and I had a chance to review his answers. I do not believe that there is complete truth to everything that he said in those answers and frankly I do not even know if he even answered the questionsthat were being asked. All I am asking is a chance to use my vote as it is my right as a citizen of this state and of this country. Many have given their very lives to preserve these rights for all of us and now Neil Abercrombie believes he can change all of that in five days? It is wrong. .it is deceitful..it is manipulative. .and it is unconstitutional. I ask that you takemy testimony into consideration and the testimony of thousands of others who share the samethoughts. I am extremely concerned if this bill passes, of the detrimental ramifications this will cause. And the ripple effect will be greater than you or I can imagine. .even long after you and I are gone. This will hinder generations to come and the Hawaii that you and I were raised in and have grown to love will be gone forever and your posterity will have nobodybut you to thank. Please take these testimonies into consideration as you make your decision in this very critical matter. May God guide you to do what is right. Respectfully, Jacquelyn Franco 92-984 Panana Street Subject: SB1: Opposition to Same Sex Marriage Date: Sunday, October 27, 2013 9:13:22 AM Our names are James and Lorrie Roller, and we want to reach out to you to express our serious concerns about the upcoming bill for same-sex marriage. We implore you to read the research from the state of Massachuetts detailing the harm same sex marriage has created since legalized. There have been negative impacts in the public schools, public health, hospitals, domestic violence, business and employment, adoption, First Amendment violations such as freedom of religion and speech and of course within the families themselves. We are charged with protecting our children and preserving their futures. Destroying the nucleus of the family unit and redefining an institution that is necessary to the rearing of healthy and productive children is what same sex marriage would bring to Hawaii , and you will have that legacy on your watch. We urgently, and strongly ask you to reconsider your position on this issue and vote NO. Additionally we request that a \"roll call\" vote be taken. Thank you for your continued public service.From: James Arcate To: JDLTestimony Subject: TESTIMONY IN OPPOSITION TO SB 1 RELATING TO EQUALITY Date: Thursday, October 24, 2013 11:55:25 AM Clayton Hee, Chair Senate Committee on Judiciary and Labor Re: TESTIMONY IN OPPOSITION TO SB 1 RELATING TO EQUALITY Dear Honorable Chair Hee and Members of the Committee on Judiciary and Labor: A lot of men and women get married to each other in civil marriage ceremonies. This is a lot like Civil Unions in Hawaii, where no religious institution is required to perform or recognize them. So simply amend Hawaii's Civil Unions Law to confer the benefits of marriage without using the word \"marriage\". This approach would eliminate the need for all to agree that marriage is between a man and a woman. James R. Arcate 3447 Pipa PlaceHonolulu, HI 96822(808) 988 9713Re: TESTIMONY IN OPPOSITION TO SB 1 RELATING TO EQUALITY Dear Honorable Chair Hee and Members of the Committee on Judiciary and Labor: My name is Jamilah Hernandez, I re side at 1331 Ala Kapuna Street. I am in opposition to the SB 1 Bill (Same sex marriage). I have been living in Hawaii for more than eigh t years now. I am a veteran and now call Hawaii home for my children and I. I am not a local, but my children have grown up here and my youngest son Kaeo was born here. They love Hawaii and love growing up her e. I am a registered voter here in Hawaii, and I would like to personally thank Rep. Aaron Ling Johanson, whom I voted for, for all his hard work and dedication for representing the pe ople in District 31. I am so happy that some of our representatives are listening to the people and trying to kill this Bill. I can t believe some of our representatives are not listening to the voice of the people. If this Bill is passed it will greatl y affect many of the hard working families here in Hawaii. This Bill will violate the 1st Ammendment Rights of the people of District 31. I have spoken to many of my friends and other mothers in this community and they all feel the same way. We all feel this Bill will have a negative affect on this community . I hope that other representatives realize how many people really don't want this bill passed . Many families don't really have the time to write letters and make calls to the different Representati ves because they are working long hours and just don't have the time. So I am writing on the behalf of all these other families that I have spoken to personally and hoping that all of the Representatives will try and get out and speak to the people. Tha nk you for all you do for the community and I hope as you decide on this Bill you will keep all the keiki in mind and what the future will be for them.

Jane NoeFrom: Janell Yim To: JDLTestimony Subject: OPPOSITION SB1 The Hawaii Marriage Equality Act of 2013 Date: Saturday, October 26, 2013 12:11:28 PM JANELL YIM 3270 PAWAINA STREET HONOLULU, HI 96822 October 26, 2013 The Honorable Clayton Hee, Chair The Honorable Maile S. L. Shimabukuro, Vice ChairSenate Judiciary and Labor Capitol415 South Beretania StreetHonolulu, Hawaii 96813 Hearing Date: Monday, October 28, 2013 at 10:30 amI will not be present at the hearing, therefore; I am submitting my written testimony Re: In Opposition to S.B. 1: The Hawaii Marriage Equality Act of 2013 Dear Senate Committee on Judiciary and Labor,I am opposed to S.B.1, The Hawaii Marriage Equality Act of 2013. Tolerance, Same-Sex Marriage and Religious Freedom . Dallin H. Oaks, a former Utah Supreme Court Judge, in 2013 awarded the prestigious Canterbury Medal for his lifetime of service in promoting the cause of religious freedom and presently a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints stated. 'Those who favor homosexual marriage contend that \"tolerance\" demands that they be given the same right to marry as heterosexual couples Tolerance obviously requires a non-contentious manner of relating toward one another's differences. But tolerance does not require abandoning one's standards or one's opinions on political or public policy choices. Tolerance is a way of reacting to diversity, not a command to insulate it from examination. The Church does not condone abusive treatment of others and encourages its members to treat all people with respect. However, speaking out against practices with which the Church disagrees on moral grounds - including same-sex marriage - does not constitute abuse or the frequently misused term \"hate speech.\".. But today's politically palatable definition insists that unless one accepts the \"sin\" he does not tolerate the \"sinner\". We can express genuine love and friendship for the homosexual family member or friend without accepting the practice of homosexuality or any re-definition of marriage. Legalizing same-sex marriage will affect a wide spectrum of government activities and policies. Once a state government declares that same-sex unions are a civil right, those governments almost certainly will enforce a wide variety of other policies intended to ensure that there is no discrimination against same-sex couples. This may well place \"church and state on a collision course.\" The prospect of same-sex marriage has already spawned legal collisions with the rights of free speech and of action based on religious beliefs. For example, advocates and government officials in certain states already are challenging the long-held right of religious adoption agencies to follow their religious beliefs and only place children in homes with both a mother and a father. As a result, Catholic Charities in Boston has stopped offering adoption services. Other advocates of same-sex marriage are suggesting that tax exemptions and benefits be withdrawn from any religious organization that does not embrace same-sex unions. Public accommodation laws are already being used as leverage in an attempt to force religious organizations to allow marriage celebrations or receptions in religious facilities that are otherwise open to the public. Accrediting organizations in some instances are asserting pressure on religious schools and universities to provide married housing for same-sex couples. Student religious organizations are being told by some universities that they may lose their campus recognition and benefits if theyexclude same-sex couples from club membership. Many of these examples have already become the legal reality in several nations of the European Union, and the European Parliament has recommended that laws guaranteeing and protecting the rights of same-sex couples be made uniform across the EU. Thus, if same-sex marriage becomes a recognized civil right, there will be substantial conflicts with religious freedom. And in some important areas, religious freedom may be diminished.\" (\"The Divine Institution of Marriage\"-Dallin H. Oaks) INTERESTING RESEARCH FINDINGS SHOW LACK OF \"TOLERANCE\" WITH GAY MEN TOWARDS TRANSGENDERS OF THE MALE TO FEMALE POPULATION: WHILE WORKING ON MY SOCIAL WORK MASTERS DEGREE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF HAWAII- ANOTHER COLLEAGUE (MY CLOSE LESBIAN FRIEND-AFTER YEARS IS STILL MY CLOSE FRIEND) AND I DECIDED TO DO OUR RESEARCH ON THE TRANSGENDER POPULATION. SHE INITIATED WORKING WITH THIS POPULATION. THIS WAS BASED ON QUALITATIVE RESEARCH. TO OUR SURPRISE, OUR FINDINGS SHOWED SOMETHING QUITE TROUBLING. HERE IS WHAT WE DISCOVERED. ALL OF THOSE WE HAD INTERVIEWED, PASSIONATELY EXPRESSED THAT THEY HAVE BEEN DISCRIMINATED THE MOST AMONGST GAY MEN THAN ANY OTHER POPULATION (HETEROSEXUAL, WOMEN, STRAIGHT MEN). THEY CONTINUED BY EXPRESSING HOW SOME OF THESE GAY MEN WOULD AT TIMES LET THEM KNOW THAT THEY ARE A DISGRACE TO THE MALE GENDER AND WERE ALSO TREATED WITH HATE, ANGER, CRUELTY, EMBARRASSMENT AND SHAME.WHAT IS INTERESTING ABOUT THIS FINDING IS THE FACT THAT THESE GAY MEN, HAVE ALSO FELT AND EXPERIENCED THE HARMING EFFECTS OF INTOLERANCE, YET THEY WERE NOW DISPLACING THIS SAME TYPE OF INHUMANE BEHAVIOR ON THESE TRANSGENDER POPULATION. YOU WOULD THINK THERE WOULD BE SOME EMPATHY AND \"TOLERANCE\" TO WHAT THESE GAY MEN HAVE EXPERIENCED. IS IT REALLY ABOUT \"EQUAL RIGHTS\" AND THE ISSUE OF 'INTOLERANCE\"? SOMETHING TOREALLY PONDER AND EXAMINE.I urge you to vote NO on S.B. 1. Thank you for your time and leadership. Sincerely,Janell Yim Hawaii Voter Clayton Hee, Chair Senate Committee on Judiciary and Labor Re: TESTIMONY IN OPPOSITION TO SB 1 RELATING TO EQUALITY Dear Honorable Chair Hee and Members of the Committee on Judiciary and Labor: I am writing in opposition to SB 1. I ask that you consider not voting on this bill during this upcoming special session. But, rather allow for more time to consider and possibly revise this bill and allow the people of Hawaii to have their voices be heard by voting on the issue themselves . I believe that this is an issue that the people of Hawaii have a strong opinion on and should be allowed to have their voices heard. I ask that you allow us, the people, to vote on the issue for ourselves. I do not feel that the opinions of the majority is currently bei ng properly represented in this special session. Fifteen years ago the people were given the power to make their voices heard on the same issue we are now looking at. At the time, I was only thirteen years old and not old enough to make my opinion heard. Now I ask that you allow me to do so. The governor has stated that churches religious freedoms will be protected from having their religious rights violated. However, according to the current bill, I don't believe that the religious freedoms of many churche s in the state of Hawaii will not be protected because many churches extend the use of their facilities to the public and, therefore, would not be under any sort of protection to exercise their religious opinion regarding marriage. I ask that you do not ru sh this decision and take time to look at the issue closer. If you feel that this is a matter that the people should not be allowed to vote on, then I ask that you please take more time to consider the. Hawaii voted in favor of traditional marriage then an d I believe that opinion has not changed since. I don't believe that this special session is necessary and that extra time to discuss with the public more extensively would be beneficial to making a decision such as the defining of marriage. Respectfully, Jared Nielson From: Jared Pruitt To: JDLTestimony Subject: TESTIMONY IN OPPOSITION TO SB 1 RELATING TO EQUALITY Date: Sunday, October 27, 2013 6:54:38 AM Attachments: Petition 2.pdf Dear Honorable Chair Hee and Members of the Committee on Judiciary and Labor: Hello. My name is Jared Pruitt. I reside in Mililani, and I vehemently oppose SB 1. SB 1 is much too vague in its religious exemption language. It leaves room for obligating any religious organization or church to perform a marriage ceremony for any same sex couple. Why aren't there specific provisions and protections in the bill that explicitly say churches and religious organizations are not obligated to perform same sex marriages. Instead, SB 1 gives three stipulations that the churches and religious organizations MUST meet in order to be exempt. If a church doesn't meet those criterion, it is vulnerable to be forced to perform a same sex marriage which is in direct opposition to its faith and beliefs. I believe that legalizing same sex marriage without protecting churches and religious organizations is a direct violation of the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment. A church or religious organization should not be forced by the government or any law it creates to perform any service which violates its tenants of faith and beliefs. Please, let the people decide on this issue, and don't make this bill law until the regular session next year. I am attaching a petition that I started at moveon.org. It is signed by 1,279 others who feel the same way. We hope that you will listen to the voices of the people you serve. Thank you for your time and for serving the people of Hawaii.Jared P.K.

God created man and woman and commanded them to multiply and replenish the earth. God has commanded that the Sacred Power of Procreation are to be employed between man and women, lawfully wedded as husband and wife. The Family is central to the Creators plan for the eternal destiny of his children. Because of the rapid growth in technology, media, and the corruption of material and worldly things exploited before our natural eyes, the value of family, the importance of traditions, the respect and acknowledgement of God the Father is diminishing quickly and the hastening of Destruction is nigh at hand.

I have no problem with \"Civil Unions\" and legal rights should go along with those unions. I do have a problem with weak politicians caving in to the demands of a minority of people who think they have the right to dictate what my rights should be. I believe in the sanctity of marriage - that it involves one man and one woman - period! Every child deserves the right to one father and one mother. Gods laws cannot be changed, even if man laws try to deem it differently. Take God out of the equation and gay unions are against Natures Law! If we were all supposed to be gay, than there would be no WE! Keep civil unions between gays their term for \"marriage\" and accord them all the legal rights with that union. Keep marriage as the union between one man and one woman - period! LET THE PEOPLE DECIDE!! It takes the pressure off you and puts it in the hands of the people! Keep God and His churches separate, we should not have to be forced to perform weddings in the very places we hold sacred. This bill needs to be thrown out and a newer stronger one re-written to give more protection to the people that believe that marriage is not something to be bought or sold to the highest bidder!!!

Please allow us to keep our freedom of religion. This government already has taken so much of our freedom away, and it should not take more of our freedom away because a small percentage of people who want to practice homosexuality. We believe in the true nature of family, and we do not need to give up our traditions. I accept all those who decide to live differently than myself, but, for me and my future family, I would like to make sure that a traditional marriage in the temple will be accessible.

I believe people have the right to choose a same-sex relationship if that is what they want to choose. By the same token, the government does not have the right to dictate what I can believe, or what I can say about what I believe, or force me or my church to violate our religious beliefs. DO NOT RESTRICT THE RELIGIOUS ORGANIZATIONS FROM THE FREE EXERCISE OF THEIR BELIEFS. That means that in no way should the churches be required to perform same-sex marriage- IN NO WAY, SHAPE OR FORM. And don't kid yourself, that IS what this is ultimately about.

When the world will finally begin to accept the study of the paranormal and the extraterrestrial as normal, that is when religion and science may perhaps be united.

The present view of this \"civil rights?\" law does not even concern itself with the future...even in the next year's educating children on the NEW model for what constitutes family life style...reorganizing history from the beginning of God's plan to man's enlightened plan causing confusion and chaos. If this bill for SSM passes the consequences will not only split our state and country but will bring division and loss of religious rights of the majority of our citizens. A few will take away the rights of the many. Freedom of Religion will be minimal. GOD HELP US.

This bill is prohibiting many different religions to practice the freedom that many people have died over. Jesus Christ has taught that marriage is a sacred constitution that is between men and women and within that sacred bond we are to bring children into this world. I am married and I have a 15 week old son and I want him to be raised on the teachings of Jesus Christ, and to honor what the bible has taught us all these years. Heavenly Father gave Adam and Eve (not Adam and Steve or Eve and Jean) to multiply and replenish the earth and that commandment continues on today. If this passes that commandment is being rejected and it demonstrates that the state of Hawaii does not care at all about Heavenly Father nor his commandments.

Shelby Mililani, 96789 Oct 21, 2013 134From: JDLTestimony-WrittenOnly Subject: Hawaii Marriage Equality Act Date: Thursday, October 24, 2013 6:51:55 PM Aloha, My name is Jayne Gubler and I am a resident of Oahu, Hawaii. I am testifying on the state measure before the Senate on Marriage Equality. I am testifying in opposition to this bill.I have researched and compared Hawaii's marriage equality act to that of other states and find that Hawaii's is far too intrusive on the rights of independent organizations of faith. I myself attend a church that does not endorse same-gender marriages yet our clergy will be forced to perform them or face legal action. I feel that the freedom of worship how we please in our private church facilities is just as important as that of public accomodations, separate but equal.Please take into account what the majority of the people of Hawaii want when you consider this bill. I feel strongly that your voting public do not agree with the current version of this bill. Mahalo for your service.Jayne Gubler55-463 Moana StreetLaie, Hawaii 96762808-234-9122 Dear Chair Hee and Members of the Committee on Judiciary and Labor: My name is Jean Tsuda and I vote in Senate District 24 and House District 50. I am speaking to voice my opposition to Bill SB1 and this Special Session. I am a voter who takes by civil responsibilities seriously and have voted ever since I was old enough to do so. You legislators were given the opportunity to represent us, to champion the cause which we, your constituents believe to be representative of the majority of the people. Voting yes on SB 1 is not a vote representing the majority of the people. The issue of same sex marriage is too important and complex to be relegated to a special session where there are only 2 public hearings scheduled as compared to the usual 5 in regular session. It has to be vetted properly in regular session. Special sessions are held for emergency situations or events such as 9/11 and the Super -Ferry or to correct technical flaws in our laws. Governor Abercrombie unilat erally called for the special session. No other state (34) is rushing in special sessions on this issue. At no other time has our Governor acted on his or her own to pass a law in special session. The democratic process is being circumvented. The vote rs should be given the opportunity to decide on this issue in a constitutional amendment in 2014. Thank you. From: Eldean Kukahiko To: JDLTestimony Subject: TESTIMONY IN OPPOSITION TO RELATING TO EQUALITY Date: Saturday, October 26, 2013 8:47:22 PM FOR SENATE HEARING 10/28/13 10:30AM Dear Honorable Chair Hee and Members of the Committee, My name is Jeanette Kukahiko. My address is 47-237 Waihe'e Road. I am 7/8ths Hawaiian and proud of it. I am a mother of 6 and a grandmother of 22. I am in opposition to Same Sex Marriage for the following reasons: 1. This bill will hurt my children, grandchildren and all children of Hawaii. As I see it the schools will be forced to teach the homosexual life style which will directly conflict with my parental teachings of my Hawaiian ancestral traditions and my Christian faith. As it stands- THIS IS NOT PONO! 2. I believe that I have the right to raise my family with values that is lawful, morally right and has been right for over 2,000 years, and now you think that in 5 days of a special session you will be able to hear from all the people you represent to help you make an informed decision? I respectfully DISAGREE 3. LET US THE PEOPLE VOTE. IF YOU AR SO SURE THAT THIS IS WHAT THE PEOPLE WANTS, THEN LET US VOTE..........OR DO YOU THINK WE ARE NOT CAPABLE? 4. DO IT IN THE REGULAR SESSION-SLOW DOWN AND DO IT RIGHT Sincerely....Jeanette KukahikoFor the Senate hearing : Hearing on 10/28 @ 10:30am Clayton Hee, Chair Senate Committee on Judiciary and Labor Re: TESTIMONY IN OPPOSITION TO SB 1 RELATING TO EQUALITY Dear Honorable Chair Hee and Members of the Committee on Judiciary and Labor: I am opposing Same Sex Marraige because of our heartfelt concern and compassion for the future of our state. I concern over the physical, mental and emotional problems that will beset those who choose the homosexual lifestyle, and I object to what this wi ll do to our community, my children and to my traditional family life. Evidence clearly show that children must be raised in a traditional family environment to thrive and to grow. In addition, legalizing Same Sex Marriage will have a negative effect on the liberties of religious freedom, as it relates to what the Bible holds as God's Truth and Christians' freedom to teach from it. Government should never define moral value and limit the teachings of faith group. Legalizing Same Sex Marriage will put a threat to religious freedom. Therefore, please vote NO on any piece of the Same Sex Marriage bill! FRIED GREEN TOMATOES Taste Winner of Hawaii The Original Island Style since 2003 P.O. STRONGLY OPPOSE SB 1 RELATING TO EQUALITY Aloha Honorable Chair Clayton Hee and Members of the Committee on Judiciary and Labor: We agree in the State's ability to grant Civil Unions so a man ca n marry a man or a woman and another woman, as they choose. PLEASE Make necessary changes to LET THE PEOPLE DECIDE on changing marriage . It is unfair to have such a HUGE decision be made, by a few legislators. This is a non-inclusive approach, compared to all-inclusive approach, that considers to HEAR ALL THE CITIZENS. Setting limits on the rest of the population is not pono, nor portrays social justice and is unfair to the rest of us. This bill HURTS and does not HELP our island community. This bill Helps one small group of people and discriminates against another group, that may not even be a resident of our island community. It hurts facilities ability to outreach and help everyone. We elect government officials to PROTECT ALL. This bill LIMITS RELIGIOUS PROTECTIONS. Money is the root of all evil and this bill appears to look to protect commerce of one groups interest, while taking away liberties from the majority. This bill prevents one group to extending Aloha to all. This bill sets limits on the ac tivities to invite all, by limiting the facility to be shared with non members of a facility, due to \"public accommodation\" and the threat of law suits. This bill is bias and unfair and does not recognize the toll and impact this will have on future gener ations because of imposing a will on one sector of the population who have religious convictions. Sincerely, Jeanne Vana.............................PLEASE OPPOSE Clayton Hee, Chair Senate Committee on Judiciary and Labor Re: TESTIMONY IN OPPOSITION TO SB 1 RELATING TO EQUALITY Dear Honorable Chair Hee and Members of the Committee on Judiciary and Labor: It is with great concern that I write to you regarding S B 1; I strongly feel that passing this bill undermine the moral constitution of our state's culture. Such an important decision should not be made through a Special Session rather this important topic ought to be voted on by the people of Hawaii as it was in 1998. With approximately 70% of the populous opposing same sex marriage in 1998, it is incomprehensible to think that the majority of the people of Hawaii now feel differently on this subject, the fact that some would disagree with this assertion only s erves to underscore the importance of allowing the people of Hawaii to vote on this subject. Thank you for your consideration, Jeffrey Mullis From: Jennifer Bryant To: JDLTestimony-WrittenOnly Subject: SB 1 - Same Sex Marriage - Written Testimony Date: Wednesday, October 23, 2013 8:17:45 PM To the Committee on Judiciary and Labor Senate Bill 1 - Relating to Equal Rights; Marriage EqualitySpecial SessionHearing Date / Time: Monday, October 28th, 2013; 10:30 am Aloha, Senator Clayton Hee, Senator Maile S. L. Shimabukuro, and Senator Donna Kim Mercado, Thank you for taking the time to read and acknowledge my testimony. I realize that your time is valuable, so I will be brief. I wish to express my opposition to this Senate Bill as relating to Marriage Equality, or in essence Same Sex Marriage. I am a voting constituent in the McCully / Moili'ili District and I believe that the passing of this bill will forever shape the way our first amendment rights and the way we educate our children will be lived out. I am a former middle school teacher in California and the Hawaii D.O.E., and current preschool director in downtown Honolulu. The ramifications of making no difference between genders (not only by giving them the right to marry, but by gender neutralizing language in documents and in practice of common language) will place proverbial cuffs on our parents and educators from teaching children the very real differences between boys and girls, men and women, and some of the traditional, yet necessary roles they occupy in society. I am not against the union of two people who commit to love each other, but the act of marriage carries so much more weight, and changing that will leverage groups like the LGTB alliance to push for more and more rights just as they have done in Canada - since 2005 this country has struggled with the obliteration of parental rights to teach their children without the government getting involved through the schools, and allowing sexual education to enter the curriculum as early as first grade. This issue is so much more than stopping bullying and anti-discrimination against homosexuals, it will trample on freedom of religion, speech, and education of ALL individuals. Educators and school counselors can still counsel students who have gender identity issues and discourage bullying of all kinds, even without marriage equality. The message can still be focused on the individual person or even partners who wish to continue their civil unions. Please do not allow our state to change the face of equal rights and have a negative affect on how we raise our children. Thank you again for your time - please make the right choice for your children and grandchildren. Most Sincerely, Mrs. Jennifer Bryant-- Assistant Director Ke Aloha Ho'okahi Preschool 670 hearing : Hearing on 10/28 @ 10:30am Clayton Hee, Chair Senate Committee on Judiciary and Labor Re: TESTIMONY IN OPPOSITION TO SB 1 RELATING TO EQUALITY Dear Honorable Chair Hee and Members of the Committee on Judiciary and Labor: I would like to take this opportunity to inform you that I am opposed to there being a Special Session on any same -sex marriage issue. Same -sex marriage is not a civil right. No court (including the United States Supreme Court) has ever said that same -sex marriage is civil right. In 2002, the Error! Hyperlink reference not valid. rejected the complaint that New Zealand banned same -sex marriage violating civil right. It is my opinion that the issue of same -sex marriage should be voted on by the public just as it was back in 1998 when the majority of citizens in the State of Hawaii voted to approve a constitutional amendment against same -sex marriages. The use of a speci al session limits my opportunity to voice my opinion on this issue and may result in legislation that does not represent the will of the people. Please let the people decide on marriage. From: Jeremy Honold To: JDLTestimony Subject: Strong Opposition of SB1 Date: Friday, October 25, 2013 7:51:50 PM Dear Chair Hee and Members of the Committee on Judiciary and Labor: I am writing to voice my opposition to Bill SB1. I believe the people of Hawaii should decide this matter. I believe the legislature is going against the will of the people. I am asking you to allow the people to decide on the issue of marriage as I believe the legislature is going against the will of the people. I support equality for all including the rights ofconscience and religious freedom, which I ask you to respect as our elected leaders. I am opposed to the most contentious social issue in our history being decided virtually in one weekand ask that you please uphold the principles of democracy and the democratic process which are being disregarded in this special session. Something of this magnitude should not be decided in one week, nor should every voice in the islands be ignored. This bill should be given due process during the regular session where it can properly be vetted and examined as all other bills. The people who elected you to serve as their voices should have a say inpublic policy that will forever obliterate thousand of years of indigenous and non-native culture, customs and traditions. We were founded on letting the people have their voices be heard. By closing the doors and letting a small group decide the fate of an entire state, I believe you are sayingno to democracy. Thank you for the opportunity to testify. Jeremy Honold Kapolei, HI 96707From: Joan OPPOSITION TO SB 1 RELATING TO EQUALITY Date: Thursday, October 24, 2013 8:19:35 PM Dear Honorable Chair Hee and Members of the Committee on Judiciary and Labor: I believe that our laws and the system that is set up to govern our people were set in place so that decisions that affect all of us are not made by just a few. In 1998, all of our people had the opportunity to make their voices heard on how our state should define \"marriage\" and decided by a 69% - 28% majority, that marriage would consist of the legal union between one man and one woman. There was much discussion, debate, and TIME given to the public to allow voters to thoughtfully determine their choice on this important matter. And we did! I am not in favor of same-sex marriage and I do not feel that it is right for some of our legislators to disregard the vote of the people of Hawaii by rushing and pushing through legislation in six days that will affect our state and its people forever. You, our legislators, would be acting against the people of Hawaii and the federal court ruling of August 8, 2012 (Jackson vs. Abercrombie) by attempting to overturn the vote of our people. You do not have that right. The people of Hawaii gave you the right to define marriage as the union between one man and one woman. According to the Jackson vs Abercrombie ruling, \" to suddenly constitutionalize the issue of same-sex marriage 'would short-circuit' the legislative actions that have been taking place in Hawaii.... Accordingly, because Hawaii's marriage laws are rationally related to legitimate government interests, they do not violate the federal Constitution.\" It is my understanding that the recent ruling by the Supreme Court did not say there is a constitutional right to same-sex marriage. But rather, for those states who have allowed same-sex marriage, these couples cannot be denied the federal benefits that married couples receive. However, Hawaii does not allow same-sex marriage so we are not violating anyone's constitutional rights or withholding any due benefits. Please do not twist the facts and confuse our people to make them think that Hawaii is doing something wrong. As representatives of the people of Hawaii, I ask you to represent the people of Hawaii with honesty and integrity. You were not placed in your position to push forward your own personal or political agenda but rather, to represent the voice of your constituents. The people of Hawaii spoke out in force in 1998. Please listen to and represent the voice of our people. May God lead you and guide you to make the right decisions for the right reasons. \" The Life of the Land is Perpetuated in Righteousness\" Sincerely, Joan Yanazaki 3142 Francis Tracy Hao JDLTestimony Subject: Fw: Personal Testimony of same sex marraige issue Date: Friday, October 25, 2013 11:39:12 PM Dear Honorable Chair Hee and Members of the Committee on Judiciary and Labor: MY NAME IS JOANNE WISINSKI AND I LIVE ON MOLOKAI I am thankful that we live in a country where we have a voice.

We should not be having a Governors Special Session. This should be decided by the vote of the people and not the legislature.2. We should not be reinventing the definition of marriage. This will result in a seismic shift in cultural values and this will help erode even further protection for children, women and families.3. I feel this will take away my religious freedom.

Jonna LewisFrom: judyarthuronmaui@aol.com To: JDLTestimony Subject: Same sex marriages NO 1 Date: Saturday, October 26, 2013 9:49:14 AM I AM AGAINST THIS BILL AND SAME SEX MARRIAGES! JUDY ARTHURPersonal Testimony Presented Before the Senate Committee on Judiciary and Labor Sen. Clayton Hee, Chair Sen. Maile Shimabukuro, Vice Chair October 28, 2013, 10:30 am (hearing date and time) by Justin Akagi 700 Richards Street, #1002 Honolulu, HI 96813 Opposition for SB 1, Relating to Equal Rights (Not testifying in person, submitting written testimony only) I would like to take this opportunity to inform you that I am opposed to the Senate voting on same sex marriage during this special session . It is my opinion that the issue of same sex marriage should be voted on by the public ( just as it was back in 1998) so that every single one of your constituents will have the opportunity to have their individual voice heard. Although the Senate members re present their constituents when voting on many issues, I believe that a decision of this magnitude should be made by all members of the community with adequate time to make an informed and educated decision, rather than a small subset (who represent some, but not all of their constituents ' opinions on issues) . Instead of voting \"yes\" for same sex marriage during this special session, please consider not voting or abstaining from a vote, so that we can ensure that a n irrevocable decision of this magnitude will not unknowingly affect our other Constitutionally -guaranteed civil liberties . I also believe that many potential consequences of this bill have not been taken into formal consideration (as should be the case before making a decision of such magnitude) , such as the effects on religious freedom, the educational system in Hawai'i, the economy, and the community. Before making this decision, more comprehensive research should be done on other states and countries that have legalized same sex marriages, and how that decision has affected their communities and civil liberties (e.g., religious freedom) . I believe that if we allow Hawai'i's citizens to vote on same sex marriage, there will be time for the entire community to make an informed and educated decision on the matter. It does not seem that due diligence is being met by making the decision to vote on a bill of this magnitude during a special session. Please do not make this enormous decision without your constituents truly having a voice in the decision of this issue. From: Justine Saturday, October 26, 2013 10:36:28 PM Clayton Hee, Chair Senate Committee on Judiciary and Labor Re: Strong Opposition of SB1 Dear Honorable Chair Hee and Members of the Committee on Judiciary and Labor: We are writing to voice our opposition to Bill SB1 relating to equality. We strongly feel that the legalization of same-sex marriage could have detrimental consequences for our state and residents. Not only for families today, but also for our future generations. We ask that you please consider our concerns. Thank you for your time.Sincerely,Justine Kadokawa, Patricia Kadokawa a voter and I oppose same sex marriage Date: Sunday, October 27, 2013 8:48:10 AM Aloha, As a registered voter and lifetime resident of Hawaii I strongly oppose same sex marriage because of my religious beliefs - marriage has and should continue to be defined as between a man and a woman, and children are entitled to being raised in this kind of traditional family. Further, I feel this issue should be decided by a vote of the people -NOT in a special session. However, if same sex marriage is legalized in Hawaii, we need stronger exemptions for religious organizations, clergy, and businesses - the proposed bill does not protect our freedom of religion. TO SB 1 RELATING TO EQUALITY Date: Saturday, October 26, 2013 2:04:56 PM Dear Honorable Chair Hee and Members of the Committee on Judiciary and Labor: My name is Karli Miyata, and I am a 36 year old lifetime resident of Hawaii. I opposeSB1 and redefining \"marriage\". (Would it be ok to redefine \"native Hawaiian\" just so we all can apply to Kamehameha Schools and receive other benefits of nativeHawaiians? I don't think so.) I am not in opposition to the gay & lesbian community. We all have free will, andwhatever we choose does not make one any more or less of a human being. God loves us all equally. Although I believe that gays & lesbians should have certain rights, I also believe that our existing rights to freedom of speech, religion &conscience should be protected first and foremost. As written, SB1 does notguarantee that protection. There is clear evidence that these rights have beeninfringed upon in every place that has legalized same-sex marriage. So I urge you tonot let history repeat itself. Please protect our right of choice too. Holding a special session and rushing such a weighty decision is not the proper wayof handling this. Please do the right thing and let the people decide. Mahalo.

For assistance please email webmaster@capitol.hawaii.gov I would like to thank you for the opportunity to give you my testimony in regards to Senate Bill 1, or the State of Hawaii Marriage Equality Act of 2013. I feel that this legislation needs to be voted on as an Amendment to the Constitution of the State of Hawaii. If a decision of this magnitude, which will directly and indirectly affect so many of our citizen' s, and the future of generations to come, is not placed on the ballots for an amendment it would be a slap in the face for democracy. A vote was held on similar legislation in 1998, and I strongly urge you to consider this action. Both sides have an argument for their views. Both sides have provided testimony here today. Regardless of what is required at the minimum to pass this legislation th rough this special session, I ask that you do the right thing and move to suspend Senate Bill 1, or the State of Hawaii Marriage Equality Act of 2013, and introduce the necessary legislation for a vote by the people to make an amendment to the state consti tution. The results of that vote should be the determining factor. Once the vote is completed, a clear vision of where the majority of voters stand on this issue will be provided. That would be the correct time to move this bill forward if it is warranted , not now. Thank you. From: Kaye Katherine Destacamento To: JDLTestimony-WrittenOnly Subject: Opposition to bill S.B.

NO. 1 and let it be documented that I personally oppose this bill and any fraction thereof. I am taking this stance: I know and believe that marriage should just be between a man and a woman. I can't imagine the world having children who have parent with the same sex; it's not healthy for them psychologically, emotionally, and socially. How can we have a better future if our future generation is not taught with correct values? I appreciate the time you have spent in hearing my position, which again is opposition to bill S.B. NO. 1.

I am a student at Windward Community College and I live at 47-237 Waihe'e Road. I am opposed to Same Sex Marriage because I do not understand all the problems that is ahead for us because of this legislation. I hear from other states that it is very bad for theregular people. Why don't we learn from the other states what works and what does not?-then present that to us and let us decide. Sincerely, Kehaulani QuinataOctober 25, 2013 I am strongly against same sex marriage. Financial gain seems to be at the root of this strong push toward same sex marriage in this special session. However, over time it will not be a benefit to our state but rather a hindrance because of the negative impact it will have on the morality of our state. It will weaken the basis for our society, the family unit. Instead of pushing same sex marriage through for financial gain please let the people vote on this very important issue. Thank you, Kellee Emmerich From: yasuharak@aol.com To: Hearing date: 10/28/13 OPPOSITION to SB 1 Ken Yasuhara Dear Honorable Chair Hee and Members of the Committee on Judiciary and Labor: Since the governor is NOT allowing any amendments to this bill, all testimony directed toward amending this bill is moot and a waste of time for all of us here. Therefore, I would like to address the process by which this bill is trying to be approved. DEMOCRACY has been defined as a government in which decisions are voted upon by the public.Some how, it feels as if the democratic process is being circumvented here. Why the urgency to get this bill passed so quickly? If it were for tax purposes, why aren't the other 34 states where SSM is not recognized also not clamoring to get a similar bill passed ASAP? Shouldn't the role of an elected official be one that represents their constituent's voices and not trying to advance ANY personal agendas? I believe it is extremely irresponsible and even dangerous when an elected official ignores the majority of their constituency and does what ever he or she wants based on his or her own personal beliefs. Because SSM is such a heated, emotional issue, it is extremely difficult to converse with someone intellectually or analytically on the subject. It truly is a matter of the heart. Regardless of what your personal views are on this issue, I believe this bill should be struck down. If you disagree with this bill, then vote NO; if you agree with this bill, I ask that you also vote NO so that the PEOPLE can have anopportunity to have a say in this emotional issue. I cannot, in good conscience, and for the sake of my daughter and my family, let this issue go unchallenged on my watch without at least voicing my concerns and speaking out against this bill. I ask that you vote NO on this bill, and let the PEOPLE VOTE on this critical issue!Thank you for your consideration in this matter.Respectfully Oct 28, 2013 10:30AM (Written Only) Date: Friday, October 25, 2013 10:20:07 AM SB1 Submitted on: 10/25/2013 Testimony for on Oct 28, 2013 10:30AM in Conference Room Auditorium Submitted By Organization Testifier PositionTestifying in Person Keoni Ronald May Individual Oppose No Comments: Greetings to the Senate: I have family & friends, who are gays & lesbians.

For assistance please email webmaster@capitol.hawaii.govKevin and Sylvia Kondo 2370 Jasmine Opposition to SB1 Hawaii Marriage Equality Act of 2013 Honorable House Speaker Joseph Souki , Our family would like to register its opposition to same sex marriage being voted on at the upcoming special session on October 28, 2013. We speak for many of our neighbors who are loyal citizens of this great nation and State of Hawaii. The majority of the citizenry voiced its support of t raditional marriage back in 1998 . It would be very wrong to go against the citizen's choice, and instead attempt to legislate same sex marriages in this special session. This would fly in the face of what has been the norm from the beginning , and will fly in the face of what God ordained for marriage. Same sex marriages would further destabilize our culture and create untoward problems both for us now and for our posterity. Children need the st ability of a father and a mother, and experience has shown that alternate family structures can never replace this. We face so many problems with single parent families, why would this State desire to take on even greater problems with same sex marriage. You must consider carefully the impact your vote will have, to either strengthen or weaken this great State both now and for future generations. Do you want your name s to go down in history associated with a measure that has been perpetrated upon our Stat e by a vocal minority? Our hearts go out to our youngsters who will inherit the problems that will be created if you allow same sex marriage to prevail . We urge you to stand behind the majority of the citizens of this State, and vote no to same sex marriag e. Sincerely, Kevin and Sylvia Kondo From: Kevin Hanna To: JDLTestimony Subject: Sopecial Session on Same Sex Marriage Date: Friday, October 25, 2013 3:55:25 PM Though the Special Session now seems imminent, please remove from the agenda or or vote down the Same Sex marriage (SSM) bill proposed by the Governor's office. The calling of a Special Session was never intended as a vehicle to change social behavior and make social public policy, it is a mechanism to handle legitimate emergencies which \"REQUIRE\" a timely response. The SSM initiative in no way fits this intent.The Special Session does not allow for adequate public input and/or the amending the proposed legislation. While I recognize that there are two days scheduled out of the 5 or 6 days of deliberation, this is not sufficient to hear the testimony of most of the people of these islands. To my knowledge, both of these hearings are in Oahu and none that I now of here in Hilo where or any of the other islands. This is not the sort of issue that should be rushed into, just so that a very few may benefit for the tax implications which are sited as one of the main reasons to push this though quickly. What is the MOST important result of this battle is not the passage or failure of any one legislative item, it is the adherence to the the democratic process. If the public is not engaged in the processes on such an important issue, then indeed Democracy have taken a severe blow. Please do not subvert the democratic process by forcing the issue in special session.Please remove the Same Sex Marriage bill from the agenda of this session and allow the people of Hawaii to be stake holders in both this issue and the process of government. I have voted in every election since I became of age, and that will not change in the future. However, who I elect or re-elect to represent will very much depend on the outcome of the next few days.

Hawaii already has provided for Civil Unions, which grants the maximum amount of Equal Protections that a State can provide to a Same -Sex Couple. There is NOTHING further to gain by taking on the subject of marriage equality, except for FEDERAL benefits and recognition -- in which case, it is a FEDERAL battle, not a State battle. The burden is upon the Federal Government to extend Federal benefits of Marriage to those in Civil Unions, as well as Domestic Partnershi ps. As the Marriage -Equality proponents prominently say, \"The government should not be in the business of telling people who they can and cannot marry.\" I am all for equal Civil Rights in Hawaii, and am confident Hawaii has sufficiently provided that wit h our recent passage of Civil Unions. To now ask the People of Hawaii to consider anything further is an outrageous waste of time and resources; but should it move forward, said issue should be placed on a ballot for the Voting Public to decide. Please d iscard this bill to allow the issue of marriage equality to be fought in its proper arena in the National Spotlight. Hawaii has already met the challenge of providing Equal Rights to same -sex couples by providing for Civil Unions.

Shimabukuro, Vice Chair From: .Mr. and Mrs. Lawrence B. Kane Dear Chairperson Hee, Vice Chair Shimabukuro, and members of the Senate Committee on Judiciary and Labor, We understand that are now reviewing SB 1 \"Relating to Equality\" a bill that, if enacted, will forever redefine marriage in Hawaii. On October 28, the Senate Judiciary will be having a hearing and if it passes, you will be asked to vote yes or no! I understand the same process will happen as the bill makes it way through the House of Representatives. This email is to ask you, please, vote NO on any piece of legislation that would redefine marriage. At the very least, a constitutional amendment should be placed on the ballot next year so that we the people can make our voice heard on this important issue. As you consider the legislation before you, I want to make it very clear that we do not support same-sex \"marriage.\" Same-sex marriage should not be passed in a special session because: \u00a7 A five day special session is not enough time to discuss the most controversial issue of our time. \u00a7 No amendments can be made to legislation. As a result, true democracy is made a mockery of. \u00a7 Hawaii is the only state rushing into special session as a result of the Supreme Court decision. If the need was truly dire, then why haven't the other 34 states that do not permit same- sex marriage done so? \u00a7 A \"yes\" vote during special session is a \"no\" vote to democracy because the voice of the people is NOT heard in a five-days special session, especially if that voice is \"amend the bill\" \u00a7 The people believed they voted on this issue in 1998 - the polls (allegedly) show that Hawaii favors same-ex marriage. So why not let the people vote?Same-sex \"marriage\" is not merely about same-sex couples getting \"married.\" It is about new marriage and family norms and values being imposed on society by the government, with threat of punishment for those who do not conform, or who will not abandon their deeply-held moral beliefs or values which are now recognized as the norm. Wherever same-sex \"marriage\" is legal, individuals, businesses, organizations, and even churches have been punished. People have been fined or sued, or lost their jobs, for merely posting their beliefs on Facebook or for stating what is in the Bible. The time restriction on testifying prevents us from listing more examples. But I hope that you our lawmakers do not deny the reality that the LGBTQ activist movement are poised to do all they can to turn our society upside down with lawsuits and with further legislation to impose their values on our culture, beginning with children in the schools. Their local leaders have very recently stated that besides same-sex \"marriage\", two priority goals are to make gender reparative therapy illegal in Hawaii , and to require every school to have a Gay- Straight Alliance organization. We learned from the media that the majority of our lawmakers had decided to approve same-sex \"marriage\", long before the public could be heard. This special session is rushed and does not give ample time for us to be heard and for you, our lawmakers, to carefully consider the repercussions of same-sex \"marriage.\" I respectfully ask that this bill be rejected, for many serious reasons . In 1998, we the people of Hawaii thought we voted for marriage between opposite-sex couples. Please do not betray us by dishonoring the will of the people. I join the tens of thousands of people who are shouting for our lawmakers to allow the people to decide on marriage. I ask you to pass legislation which will allow us to vote once again on a Constitutional Amendment to preserve marriage between one man and one woman. Respectfully submitted.

It is my deep concern that this will bill affect our current and future generations.I strongly believe in a marriages that is a man and a woman. I believe that asame sex marriage will alter the course of our state for the good of thepeople. I want to express that I have no ill feelings towards the people who believes in same sex marriages but I will not vote for this bill to pass, and it is theright of the people to vote on this issue and not solely on the governor'sdecision. Respectfully, Leonardo AlarcioLeonardo078@msn.com October 25, 2013 Testimony AGAINST SB1 Aloha, I am OPPOSED to the Same -Sex Marriage Bill. Please vote NO on SB1! I respect and love my fellowmen. I respect the right of all US citizens to choose their way of life. But this law will infringe upon MY fundamental & constitutional rights to freedom of speech and freedom of religion. These are far more valuable than giving a few of the citizens of Hawaii the right to rec eive Federal Marriage Benefits. Please preserve our states' fundamental freedoms. Please vote NO to the Same -Sex Marriage Bill! Subject: Please Do Not Support Same Sex Marriage - Written Testimony Date: Thursday, October 24, 2013 9:55:43 PM Personal Testimony Presented Before the Senate Committee on Judiciary and Labor Sen. Clayton Hee, Chair Sen. Maile Shimabukuro, Vice Chair October 28, 2013, 10:30 am (hearing date and time) by Lisa Kitagawa-Akagi 700 Richards Street, #1002 Honolulu, HI 96813 Opposition for SB 1, Relating to Equal Rights (Not testifying in person, submitting written testimony only) I would like to take this opportunity to inform you that I am opposed to the same sex marriage bill (SB 1). It is my opinion that the issue of same sex marriage should be voted on by the public just as it was back in 1998 when the majority of citizens in the State of Hawai'i voted to approve a constitutional amendment against same sex marriages. I would like to have my voice heard, as well as the voices of many others in our district who do not agree with the same sex marriage issue. Instead of voting \"yes\" for same sex marriage during this special session, please consider not voting or abstaining from a vote, so that your constituents will have the opportunity to have their voices heard (either through a vote or through a longer legislative session which would allow for more dialogue around this issue and the ability to make amendments to bills) and we can ensure that a decision of this magnitude will truly reflect what the people of Hawai'i want in regards to the same sex marriage issue. I also believe that there are a lot of ramifications of this bill that have not been taken into consideration (at the depth and level that it should be). I believe that there would be negative ramifications of this bill in relationship to religious freedom, the economy, the educational system in Hawai'i, and the community. I feel that there has not been enough research done on other countries and states that have legalized same sex marriages and how that decision has affected their communities. I believe that if we wait to either allow Hawai'i's citizens to vote on same sex marriage or have a discussion on it during the regular legislative session, there will be time to conduct this type of research. It seems a bit rash to approve such a bill when there are so many possible ramifications to consider, as well as the significant impact that it will make on our state. Please do not make this enormous decision without your constituents truly having a voice in the decision of this issue.

I think that this issue needs to be dealt with in a regular session and include the vote of the people. We believe that the people voted on this issue in 1998. If the polls show that Hawaii favors this law, then why not let the people vote? We are the only state rushing into this, and a 5-day session is not enough time to discuss the most controversial issue of our time. It is our Legislators responsibility to respect and insure fundamental democratic principles. Since the people addressed this issue in 1998, we should be the ones consulted again. Marriage is NOT a civil right, and no court (including the Supreme Court) has ever said that it is. A constitutional amendment would better address same-sex marriage AND allow for ample public input. Please do not make a mockery of our democratic rights and procedures! In addition, the governor's current bill will NOT protect church facilities (contrary to what he wants you to believe). If your church offers a public service (i.e. preschool, community group meetings), by definition, your church is a public accommodation and would be legally obligated to sanction a same-sex marriage if requested. This is in direct violation of First Amendment rights!PLEASE ALLOW OUR VOICE TO BE HEARD!Loretta L. Sawyer Subject: TESTIMONY IN OPPOSITION TO SB 1 RELATING TO EQUALITY Date: Sunday, October 27, 2013 9:48:57 AM Dear Honorable Chair Hee and Members of the Committee on Judiciary and Labor; and Chairs Rhoads and Luke and Members of the HouseJudiciary and Finance Committees: I vehemently oppose legalizing same-sex marriage in the state of Hawai'i. I believe that such a measure is in gross opposition to a scared, timelessprinciple of the sanctity of marriage between a man and woman; further, it will compromise religious freedoms and will undermine vital morals crucial to the well-being (physical, spiritual, emotional, etc.) of our society. If such a law is passed, what protections will be afforded for the exerciseof religion, when our pastors will be required to marry same-sex couples and our exercise of religion violated? If there is no protection granted for our freedom of religious expression, then this law to permit same-sexmarriage is flawed and should not be passed. Over the years, our freedom of religious expression has long since been violated as alternative lifestyles are permitted to be taught in our schools, and our opposition for such curriculum squashed. We are ill affordedprotections for the freedom of religious expression in advocating fortraditional marriage, pro-life vs. abortion, teaching creationism, freedom ofexpression through prayer, and abstinence when teaching our youth about sex education in our public schools. I can no longer be passive in allowing government to create laws which will further compromise our freedom ofreligious expression. Further, Brian J. Grim and Roger Finke, The Price of Freedom Denied and Hudson Institute's Center for Religious Freedom study, provides societal benefits of religious freedom quantified: Religious freedom promotes stability in a pluralistic society, but when limited, it correlates to increased violence and conflict. Wherever religious freedom is high, there is more economicprosperity, better health, lower income inequality and prolonged democracy. Religious freedom directly correlates with the protection afforded other civil and human rights; if some agency can control the yearnings of faith and conviction, then that agency could, in JamesMadison's words, \"sweep away all our fundamental rights,\" such as freedom of speech, press and assembly. Laws are established to guide and regulate appropriate behaviors in our society. How will such a law benefit our society when moral fundamentalsare compromised? It should be noted that I oppose the legalization of same-sex marriage, the continuing degradation of our freedom of religious expression, and the compromise of essential moral values for the benefit of our society;however, I do not oppose an individual's right to choose their pursuits inlife. I honor and value our unique qualities, and can truly accept anindividual for who they are - charity never faileth. Please consider and accept this testimony in concert with those who oppose legalizing same-sex marriage as you convene your 2013 SecondSpecial Session. May you have the wisdom needed to convey a vote which will impact our society today, and that of our posterity for generations to come.

American Chinese are very serious about family. We tell the youth that taking care the elderlies in the family is their duty. We finance businesses through family. We borrow money to buy properties through family. We obtain the best education through fami ly. We know from our hearts that we need love from father and mother, so we apply the same to others. Our children need love from their father and mother as we do. Same Sex Marriage bill is going to destroy Chinese tradition. We want our local boys and g irls know that rearing family biologically is the best. We want to give the best to our future. Therefore, please vote NO on any pi ece of the Same Sex Marriage bil l!

L. Shimabukuro andmembers of the Senate Judiciary & Labor Committee I am writing in strong opposition to Bill SB 1. I am asking that you let the people decide.. Let the people's voices be heard! I still remember - of the people, by the people, for the people! In 1998 the ballot question to voters was \"Shall the Constitution of the State of Hawaii be amended to specify that the Legislature shall have the power to reservemarriage to opposite sex couples?\"The people decided in 1998, the people must decide today. We did not give the Legislatures the power to re-define marriage, rather, reserve it for opposite sex couples only. It is very important that our voices be heard now. We are facing the same sex marriage issue AGAIN. Civil Unions was not what the LGBTMovement/Constituents wanted in the first place. I was here in 2009 when LGBT began theprocess of demanding their rights. I listened while most LGBT supporter insisted that they had no interest in marriage. One after the other asserted repeatedly that all they wanted was EQUAL RIGHTS for their partners. All they wanted was for their partnerships to be sanctioned. 2010 the same issue was re-addressed. LGBT was granted their request with the assistance of Governor Abercrombie. That should have been the end of this matter for you as Legislatures and us as tax paying constituents. They had apparently won what they had requested. Even though the voice of the people was still one of opposition, LGBT had their victory. I support getting along with mutual respect for our neighbor. I support respect of individuals. . I believe that even those who oppose the lifestyle of homosexuality have been tolerant of individuals choice to co- habitat with their choice of a partner without jeopardizing futuresecurities. Under the guise of civil rights this issue has been shrouded to pull on the heartstring of the ignorant, the uniformed ,the indifferent and those who simply believe we should just all get along. It has been obvious from the beginning that there is very limited respect for the Christian perspective, in this matter. If we are not going to allow our boundaries to be influenced by a spiritual source, may I appeal to your conscience of wisdom and discretion? For our elected officials to ignore the voice of the people they are supposed to represent is reprehensible! Wisdom and discretion must kick in at some point in our decision-making or we will findourselves without boundaries, without restraint in any areas of life and thereby victims ofcomplete chaos. For soon, more reckless behaviors, more ratings for equality because of the confusion of what is a 'right' or what is 'civil.' Such schools of thought and mind sets such as this proposed legislation is unfathomable in a rational mind. I strongly oppose this legislation as well as the proposed special session to promote passage of this bill. I pray that each of you will take note of the progression that has taken place andthat will take place if you allow passage. Without boundaries, who will be next, bi-sexuals, pedophilia, beastiality? Who else will scream for their right to express themselves in the face of this state because they assert that they were \"born that way.\" 1998 -2013 have been a clear picture to me of a masterfully orchestrated agenda. This process that was intended to be civil and a fair exchange of reasonable individuals, we havebeen strategically and intentionally lied to, manipulated and seduced into disrespecting an institution that has always been respected and honored as a bedrock of our society-Marriagebetween one man and one woman.....Let the people of the society that we all live in decidewhether those boundaries should no longer be respected or valued. Your children, grand-children and mine will grow up in a nation that has no respect for order. You will leave a legacy of re-defining the family structure-Yes, but at the risk of society that has no respect for its elected officials and their willingness to reflect the voice of the people. Let the people decide and regain the trust and confidence of the people you have beenelected to serve. Because of Grace Evangelist Marcia R.P. Harris (808)676-9712Clayton Hee, Chair 10/28/13 Senate Committee on Judiciary and Labor Re: TESTIMONY IN OPPOSITION TO SB 1 RELATING TO EQUALITY Dear Honorable Chair Hee and Members of the Committee on Judiciary and Labor: As a concerned citizen, I am submitting testimony against this special session and the bill that would legalize same sex marriage. I oppose the special session because it rushes the legislative process and does not give we, the people, sufficient input into the process. I am pa rticularly concerned that the religious exemption clauses are so sparse. Priest, pastors and churches are exempted under only very limited circumstances. There is no exemption for religious organizations, charities or fraternal societies, nor are there any exemptions for individuals. I am concerned that my First Amendment rights be protected in the process. On a p ersonal note, my 7 -year old son shared his view on the same sex marriage bill; he stated: \"I wish they don't make it pass, because I do n't want to marry the same sex. \" His sharing really gripped my heart and sadden me to think at such a young age is tormented of legalizing \"same sex marriage\". How many children or let alone maybe even adults will be as bold to share their heart felt views. This bill would be robbing the innocence of our children, grandchildren and all future generations. With such an amendment, again, our freedom of rights under the First Amendment established by our founding forefathers of this great nation will no longer hold it's validity. Has our state government really studied the what the repercussions of passing this bill would have on our judiciary systems with many law suits to follow and the impact of all people now and future generations, and not just with one group ? The state of Massachusetts and Canada, who has passed this bill, has had many avoidable lawsuits, with the rights of innocent citizens living under the rights of the First Amendment, were purged and harassed for trying to defend themselves . Please, pleas e, please, do further research so that our freedoms will not be taken away and our children and future generations will live in righteousness as in our state motto: Ua Mau ke Ea o Ka Aina i ka Pono\" - \"The life of the land is perpetuated in righteousness\" and that it be sustained throughout time. Finally, since we voted a constitutional amendment in 1998 giving the legislature the power to limit marriage between opposite sex couples, the only legitimate way to change this is to let we, the people, decide. Please d o not circumvent the democratic process! Thank you for the opportunity to testify against this special session and against this bill. Margaret E. W. Kaya Margaret E. OPPOSITION TO SB1 RELATING TO EQUALITY Date: Saturday, October 26, 2013 1:26:00 PM Dear Clayton Hee, Honorable Chairman and Members of the Committee on Judiciary and Labor, I am Mary Los Banos, the founder and president of The Children's House in Pearl City. The Children's House has been caring for the children of Hawaii for forty eight years. We accept all children that apply without testing the child or evaluating the parental background as long as space is available. Our entrance level is preschool and are children may remain with usand graduate at the sixth grade level. We have children from a variety of cultural and economic backgrounds, some lower income families receiving scholarships from numerouscommunity sources. I am deeply opposed to SBL (same sex marriage) for the emotional confusion it would createin our children. I have firsthand experience. Some years ago two women, one being the birth mother of a child attending our preschool, came to my office, for at that time I was theprincipal. They wanted to discuss our teaching on families in their child's classroom. They stated, \"We have told our son that he never had a father and we want the school to tell himthe same.\" I respectfully stated, \"It is a natural law that each of us has biological parents, one male and one female.\" They did not argue for they knew their son was receiving loving care. He was a lovely little boy, physically well cared for and appeared happy. We did not adjust any of ourteaching about families and as I recall he remained with us for some time. I was veryconcerned about the confusion, self-identity, security, and the response of his peers especiallyas he grew older. I see many problems for children of divorced and single parents and such a law would bring one more area of pain and confusion for our children. The children are our hope for thefuture, please do not bring future pain and suffering on our children. It would not only impacta child in a same sex marriage arrangement but it would be confusing to all children inrelating to their friends and growing into maturity and becoming community leaders. I beg you for the sake of our children, to vote NO on this same sex marriage bill. Sincerely,Mary 27, 2013 12:07:28 AM Clayton Hee, Char Senate Committee on Judiciary and Labor Re: Testimony to SB 1 relating to equalityDear Honorable Chair Hee and members of the Committee on Judiciary and Labor; My name is Mary Sole. I live at 98-2032 Kikala Street in Aiea. I oppose same sex marriage. This special session circumvents the democratic process. First you & your colleagues will vote on whether same sex marriage will be the law of our land or not. And, secondly a decision of this magnitude should not be made in the time allotted for this bill to become law. It is not pono. It is not right. The democratic process is being ignored. It is being pushed to the side. Shouldn't we let the people decide on this very highly controversial issue, same sex marriage? We are the people, registered voters who have elected our political officials intotheir offices, such as you, Honorable Chair & members of the Committee on Judiciary and Labor. And, in the same way that we have voted those in office, shouldn't wealso decide on such a highly charged issue? This would be pono! This would be right! Let the registered voters, here in Hawaii decide on whether same sex marriage should be here in our island home or not! However if the special session would go on as planned, then the wording concerning religious exemption under this section, #572-G Religiousorganizations and facilities; liability exemption under certaincircumstances of this bill should be made stronger. As it now written, it does not fully protect Hawaii's clergyman. They should be very well protected for they serve a vital part in our community. LET THE PEOPLE DECIDE!!! LET THE PEOPLE DECIDE!!!LET THE PEOPLE DECIDE!!!Mahalo for reading my testimony.Respectfully, Mary Sole10.26.13Testimony in Opposition to SB 1 Relating to Equality Dear Honorable Chair Hee and members of the Committee on Judiciary and Labor: My name is Mary Waialeale My address is 500 University Avenue, Honolulu, HI 96826 I am a registered voter. Same sex marriage should not be passed in a special session because: 1) A 5 day session is not enough time to discuss the most controversial issue of our time. 2) No amendments can be made to legislation. As a result, true democracy is made mockery of. 3) Hawaii is the onl y state rushing into special session as a result of the Supreme Court decision. If the need was truly dire, then why haven't the other 34 states that do not permit ssm done so? 4) A \"yes\" vote during the special session is a \"no\" vote to democracy because the voices of the people are not heard. 5) Why not let the people vote? In 1998 the people believed they voted on this issue and they should be the ones consulted again. 6) We voted you into office to respect fundamental democratic principles. Let the people vote. I am against the bill because: 7) Anything less than preserving the traditional definition of marriage creates an imprecise relationship between the state and my marriage. The fact is that words have meaning. The elevation of same -sex marriage to that of traditional marriage, combined with the use of random nomenclature to designate parties in same -sex marriage, absorbs and reduces time -honored roles of husbands and wives into a morass of meaningless linguistic jargon. 8) If marriage is a civil right for all, then what is to stop other types of non - traditional relationships? Why not permit incestuous and polygamous marriages? Why not allow marriages between adults and children? How about nuptials between people and animals? Will the age of tolerance permit Mus lim men to take multiple wives while Muslim women are restricted to one husband? These horrific possibilities destroy the nature of marriage as a sacred union between a man and a woman. On a personal note - how many of you have grandchildren? What will yo u explain to your grandchild when he shares w/ you that he has a friend whose parents are both men and he says they're married, and that you passed this into law, and he asks you how they make babies?

Shimabukuro Vice Chair Senate Judiciary and Labor Committee Hawaii State Capitol 415 South Beretania Street Honolulu, Hawaii 96813 Hearing Date: Monday, October 28, 2013 at 10:30am I will not be present to deliver my testimony Re: In Opposition to S.B. 1, The Hawaii Marriage Equality Act of 2013 Dear Senate Committee on Judiciary and Labor, My name is Mernette Cardejon and I am opposed to S. B. 1, The Hawaii Marriage Equality Act of 2013 . I am opposed to this bill for two reasons. First, the special legislative session will not allow adequate time for discussion and not provide an opportunity for an amendment. Re- defining marriage will not just affect the federal tax status but it will affect the basic unit of society, the family. This re- organization of the family will have long lasting effects that deserve thorough research and thoughtful discussion. The Super Ferry did not receive the proper research and discussion and caused a huge failure and expense to the state. The people of Hawaii deserve to have the time for research and consideration on an issue that would affect them. Second, and simply put there is no need for this law. Civil Unions became law in the state of Hawaii on January 1, 2012. Civil Unions provide Family Rights , Medical and Death related rights, as well as state tax rights. This venue already provides rights for any couple regardless of sexual orientation if they choose to enter into a Civil Union. Civil Unions provide legal rights without infringing on any first amendment rights of others to the free exercise of religion. There is simply no need to re- create the \"wheel\". In closing, I oppose S.B.1 because the special session does not provide adequate time to address the issue and Civil Unions already provide couples legal rights. Thank you, Mernette Cardejon From: Michael McGuire To: TO SB 1 Date: Saturday, October 26, 2013 9:01:33 PM Clayton Hee, Chair 10/26/13 Senate Committee on Judiciary and LaborDear Honorable Chair Hee and Members of the Committee on Judiciary and Labor: I am a registered voter and I'm opposed to the special session and the bill to legalize same- sex marriage. The tactics by this government to keep the bill out of regular session, restrict amendments, and to limit public testimony is evidence that the government is not interested in the will of the people. This Special session amounts to a state imposed redefinition of marriage that lacks a clear substantive state interest. It amounts to an imposed a \"new morality\" on the people of Hawaii while threatening the First Amendment rights of tens of thousands. Whatever your personal beliefs are on this matter, I urge you to allow the people to decide this issue. Respectfully,Michael B.

Beretania Street Honolulu, Hawaii 96813 Subject : Testimony in Opposition of Proposed Hawaii Marriage Equality Act of 2013 I am writing in opposition to th e proposed Hawaii Marriage Equality Act of 2013 that will be discussed in your Special Legislative Session beginning on October 28, 2013. According to an article on page A -13 of the September 20 edition of the Wall Street Journal, same- sex marriage legisl ation has had a devastating impact on citizens who decline to serve same- sex ceremonies due to religious conflicts. For example: A florist in Richland, Washington, was sued by the State Attorney General and the American Civil Liberties Union. A Chr istian couple that owns a bakery in Gresham, Oregon closed their shop because the State launched an investigation into their religious objections. The New Mexico Supreme Court upheld a $6,637 fine against Elane Photography, stating that being \"compelle d by law to compromise the very religious beliefs that inspire their lives\" was \"the price of citizenship.\" Many County recorders, magistrates, judges, town clerks, and justices of the peace in Iowa, Massachusetts, and New York have resigned because they were told that refusing to perform services for same- sex couples will result in criminal prosecutions for misdemeanors or other sanctions. This legislation will have little effect on the civil rights of the estimated 5% of Hawaii's residents who identif y themselves as gay or lesbian, because they can travel to any one of the fourteen states or the District of Columbia, which have adopted same- sex marriage legislation, to get married. However, it will have a catastrophic effect on the First Amendment righ ts of the 95% of Hawaii's residents who identify themselves as religious. For these reasons, I humbly request that you VOTE IN OPPOSITION to Hawaii Marriage Equality Act of 2013. Sincerely, Aaron Moke Stephens Keaau, HI 96749 From: Marriage Bill Date: Friday, October 25, 2013 5:51:46 AM Hello, My name is Moses Kealamakia Jr. I am a husband, and father. I am also of part Hawaiian ancestry, which means I am related by blood to a lot of kamaaina people here in the state. My testimony comes in the form of questions. Questions for our politicians Didn't the majority of Hawaii vote to say that the definition of marriage is between a man and a woman? What will our state legislature say to the nearly 70% people who opposed same sex marriage in 1998? Did any of our current lawmakers vote at that time to agree that marriage was between a male and female? If so, why are you changing? Have you thought about the long-term consequences? What is to be said about families in the future? Are we choosing erotic liberty over religious, moral liberty? Are we choosing to sacrifice our sacred religious liberty so that our state may have more income generated by marriage fees, and all that is associated with that? Are we choosing to throw away the natural family, natural marriage, integrity of sexuality within marriage alone, and hope for human flourishing? Why is this bill being rushed? Doesn't every child deserve to be raised by a good father and mother? If so, why break down the traditional family? Are our elected politicians following the will of their constituents? I close with two phrases. 1. It was the thinker Descartes who coined the phrase, \"Cogito Ergo Sum\" , which translates to - I think therefore I am. He taught that we cannot trust the things that come to us through our senses. Instead, we must use rational thinking to sort things out. I ask, have you thought out the consequences? Have you seen the data about what happened to Massachusetts because they allowed same sex marriage? Can you live with that? 2. The last comes from the Holy Scriptures in the Book of Isaiah chapter 5. I am paraphrasing when I say, \" Woe unto them that call good bad, and bad, good, who put darkness for light, and light for darkness, who put sweet for bitter, and bitter for sweet.\" Can you live with that? Subject: Testimony SB1 - 10:30 a.m - Committee on Judiciary and Labor Date: Thursday, October 24, 2013 11:36:36 AM I am writing to the Committee on Judiciary and Labor, regarding the Notice of Hearing scheduled for Monday, 10/28/13 at 10:30 a.m., regarding SB1 RELATING TO EQUAL RIGHTS.My testimony is to speak against this measure passing. I believe that the long-standing history and culture of marriage being designated specifically and only between one man and one woman should not be changed to include same-sex couples. I believe same-sex marriage would be a major change to an institution that exists in many cultures for good reason, and I believe that this change would be harmful to our state and community as a whole, and to children of future generations causing confusion and upheaval. I also believe, that if this issue of consequence was brought to a vote to the people of Hawaii presently, that same-sex marriage would not be passed by the majority of voters. I disagree with the special session which has been pushed forward by our Governor, without allowing the people of Hawaii to vote on the issue.

My name is Naomi Takai, District 35 Precinct 04. My initial concern is why this special session was called by the Governor. Isn't special sessions called for the reason of emergencies? And why did he use his authority to unilaterally call for this special session? If the need for a special session is an emergency (a life or death situation) as a result of the Supreme Court's decision on the Defense of Marriage Act, why haven't the other 30+ statesthat do not allow same sex marriage follow suit? I humbly ask for the legislative body to have the Governor rescind the proclamation orderinga special session and bring it to the people of Hawaii to have the privilege of voicing theirchoice at the polls. The people of Hawaii voted you into office holding our trust and faith to uphold the democratic process. Let's do it the right way. Bring it to a vote to the people and may it rest in peace. Naomi Takai94-938 Lumihoahu StreetWaipahu, HI 96797From: Nathan Cunningham To: JDLTestimony-WrittenOnly Bill Date: Thursday, October 24, 2013 6:16:31 PM Aloha! I am extremely opposed to the marriage equity bill. I fear that redefining marriage will bring dangers and problems to the state of Hawaii more than we could comprehend. With that being said, I understand that popular public opinion is to pass this law, so I understand your pressure of wanting this passed. However, I would feel it a complete injustice to my liberty as a person to not include some more provisions into the law. There NEEDS to be provisions that a religious person who, out of his or her own personal convictions, does not want to participate in same sex marriage (photographers, venues), should not have to participate. They should not fear being sued for practicing their own personal religious beliefs. I understand that the law protects clergy from performing the ceremony, but there is SO MUCH MORE that needs to be protected and I would encourage all the representatives to include more provisions into the law. There needs to be more protection for people who do not feel that this is right. If same-sex couples want to be married, fine. But do not make me participate in any way shape or form, or instill in me fear of being sued. I trust that you will make the appropriate changes.

The repercussions will disintegrate our society. You wouldn't even exist if a man and woman did not come together in love. Thank you for all the other work you do for the betterment of the larger picture of our society. Sincerely, CarolFrom: akemichan78@aol.com To: JDLTestimony-WrittenOnly Subject: I am AGAINST SB#1 Date: Friday, October 25, 2013 11:32:25 PM To Whom it May Concern, My name is Kristin. I was born and raised in Hawaii, and I am a registered voter in the state of Hawaii. I am a Christian, a wife and a mother. I graduated from high school and college here in Hawaii. I am disheartened that our \"leader\" has chosen to blindly jump on the bandwagon of trying to legalize same-sex marriage here in Hawaii...just because all the other states are doing it and it \"seems\" like the right thing to do. I submit this testimony to you, that I am AGAINST same sex marriage being legalized in a short 5 day special session. Just because our governor \"feels\" right about this issue, does not mean that the people of Hawaii feel likewise. Let the people's voices be heard. The way this bill was written, while with good intent to \"protect\" clergy from performing a marraige ceremony, the religious freedom of our churches are still being violated. I don't like how this bill is worded. All churches, and church buildings should be exempt from not only performing a same sex ceremony, but holding a reception etc PERIOD. There should be no clause or stipulation as to whether the building is \"only for member use\" etc. It needs to be CLEARLY stated that any church and church building can DENY access to its building to same sex couples. The state does NOT have the right to open doors of conflict in this matter. Let the churches, and church buildings be 100% exempt from anything to do with same sex marriages free and clear...no stipulation, no clauses that we have to meet all 3 criteria etc. Churches don't want same sex marriage, so don't make us meet criteria in order to deny it. I also don't agree that personal and family businesses should be able to be sued if the turn down a same-sex couple from their business. If a person believes that same sex marriage is wrong, and they want to turn away business, they should have that right. Just as restaurants reserve the right to deny service to anyone---private business should have that same right, no questions asked. It's not right for government to force businesses to go against their personal beliefs and force them to serve same sex couples in fear of being sued. All businesses should have the RIGHT to REFUSE business to anyone they feel they canot work with. Give them that right to choose who they want to serve, and not go against their moral belief. On top of all this, no one and I mean no one has addressed how this bill will affect public education. Everyone pushes that question on to somebody else. As a mother, I should know BEFORE HAND how this bill will affect public education. This is not a bill we pass just because \"all the other states are doing it\" and then find out afterwards what the repercussions are. These issues needs to be adressed BEFORE the bill is passed so that every parent knows exactly how this bill will affect public education. Can teachers cross dress to work? Can transgender kids use the bathroom of their choice? Will there be books allowed that portray 2 fathers or 2 mothers as \"normal\"? What will be taught? Will parents who don't believe in same sex marriage have the RIGHT to have their child removed from class when these things are taught? Remember, it's MY job to teach my children values and morals, NOT YOURS. The DOE systems can barely get the children of Hawaii to pass their standardized tests, so don't go wasting time teaching about same sex marriage--focus on the curriculum standards not which VALUES and MORALS you feel like teaching my children. That's what church is for. But realistically speaking, how will this bill affect education? LET US KNOW NOW...NOT LATER. We want answers now BEFORE any bill is randomly passed because \"all the other states are doing it\" or because \"it feels like the right thing to do\". By passing this bill, you are infringing on religious freedom. Leave all churches exempt from anything to do with same sex marriage PERIOD. Address our concerns regarding public education NOW. Don't pass this bill in a hasty, irresponsible 5 day special session. Spell everything out (the expectations and consequences of this bill passing) for the churches, for the education system, for the public in black and white, then let us study this issue and let the people decide. Present this to us with clear understanding of the pros and cons of this bill passing and then put it to a vote. Stop lying by saying nothing will change, because by changing the definition of marriage, everything will be changing. If nothing will change by passing this bill, then don't pass it. You know very well that things will change by passing this bill. Religious freedom will be stepped on, public education will change--by teaching my children \"the new society's morals\"--or lack of it, as I see it. By passing this bill in a hasty and short 5 day special session is selfish of you. Present the facts cleraly, and let us decide how we want the future of Hawaii to be. Don't let \"power\" get to your head. Give us, the voters of Hawaii, the right to decide the future.

We choose to allow the people to vote. Respectfully submitted, Eduardo Luna and Barbara Luna Sent from my iPhoneFrom: Jolene Cardenas To: JDLTestimony-WrittenOnly Subject: My testimony against Senate Bill 1 Date: Friday, October 25, 2013 9:08:52 PM dear Committee on Judiciary and Labor members, It is my personal belief that the legalization of same-sex marriage will have destructive consequences not only for us Hawaii residentsliving today, but especially for the next generations to come. Byforcing this same-sex marriage legalization bill (SB1 at http://www.capitol.hawaii.gov/splsession2013b/SB1_.pdf down my throat and those of others who have already clearly opposed it earlier, I believe that our right to freedom of speech is being openlyand completely violated and that our right to define what constitutesmarriage is being twisted out of context in order to fit your personalagendas and beliefs. This, to me, is a direct slap in the face thathas the potential to create an environment of distrust towards thoselike you folks who are supposed to represent our values and see to it that they are reflected in the laws governing the state, including those covering the definition of marriage. I have a few questions I want all of you to consider when you contemplate the option of forcibly passing this same-sex marriagelegalization bill: 1) Since God had originally intended marriage to be between a man and a woman (according to Genesis chapter 1) and since a child can beconceived only when sperm fertilizes eggs in a womb and form a baby,how can two men or two women conceive and bring a child in to thisworld? How would this \"couple\" be able to raise him or her up in anenvironment that has already been defined by heterosexual marriage values? 2) I believe that this bill is not about offering the same financial benefits to both gay and heterosexual-married couples as it is aboutpushing the values of the gay community down our throats. The lastbill I and fellow opponents had opposed had the words \"civil union\" init, not \"gay marriage\" as it seems to be this time around. Since theBible defines marriage as being between one man and one woman andtreats the union as one flesh once they are joined together inmatrimony, why has the wording of this bill been changed in order tostealthily but forcefully push same-sex couples' agendas down ourthroats? Would any of you, in your right mind, marry a loved one whois interested in marrying someone else of the same gender should you yourselves happen to also be opponents of this bill? 3) How do you suppose a child who comes from a same-sex union would have to explain to his or her peers who their Mommy and Daddy is? Andwhen he or she gets laughed at by heterosexual-oriented peers orsnubbed by equally heterosexual-oriented teachers, how much verbalabuse do you suppose this child would be able to take before he or shesnaps and then possibly gets driven to lash out at them in violentanger? When you consider the outbreak of violence that had recently occurred in public schools in the Mainland and the motives many of those young perpetrators had behind their shootings and fights, has itever occurred to you that by legalizing this same-sex marriage bill,such kids from these unnatural homes could easily use this as groundsfor attack during an otherwise typical schoolday right here in Hawaii? I urge all of you to please don't allow this same sex marriage legalization bill to become a law. Remember: The passing of this bill and the consequences it brings will live with you and the nextgeneration in your own families\u2014and those of millions of others--forthe rest of your lives. The power you folks exercise in passing oropposing this bill will affect everyone in the entire state who arefor the traditional and Biblical definition of marriage. Take a standfor what's right and vote according to your folks' God-givenconscience, which I truly believe knows what's good and what's evil. Sincerely, JoleneFrom: Rob and Suzi Daley To: JDLTestimony-WrittenOnly Subject: Proposed bill on same sex marriage Date: Friday, October 25, 2013 8:01:47 PM It is my understanding that 34 states do not approve of this arrangement and none of them are rushing to push the agenda down the throats of their citizens. The governor does not have the legal right to write bills, that is for the legislative branch. There are states close by if couples with to marry (specifically California and Washington). The supreme court has stated that marriage is NOT a right and should not be considered so. Do not pass this bill without the people of Hawaii having a choice and an opportunity to vote on something such as this that affects so many.

I am asking you to allow the people to decide on the issue of marriage as I believe the legislature is going against the will of the people. I support equality for all including the rights of conscience and religious freedom, which I ask you to respect as our elected leaders. I am opposed to the most contentious social issue in our history being decided virtually in one week and ask that you please uphold the principles of democracy and the democratic process which are being disregarded in this special session. This bill should be given due process during the regular session where it can properly be vetted and examined as all other bills. The people who elected you to serve as their voices should have a say in public policy that will forever obliterate thousand of years of indigenous and non-native culture, customs and traditions. Your \"yes\" vote in special session is clearly a NO vote to democracy! Thank you for the opportunity to testify.Pablo Penaloza Kailua Hawaii Island, Subject: Against passing Same-sex marriage as a law Date: Friday, October 25, 2013 7:54:14 PM Aloha, I am writing this email to submit my testimony against same-sex marriage.Passing same-sex marriage as a law will not only ruin what our forefathers stood for (believing in biblical teachings) but also brainwash our keiki. We cannot let a small group of people who are self-focused on individualism who want to live a life style they see fit while completely disregard what traditional marriage and family is. These people use \"equal rights\" as a way to get what they want - tax and medical benefits - while not willing to respect and follow traditional marriage. This issue has nothing to do with equal rights. Let's all face it, not everything has equal rights. I am a woman and therefore my salary is automatically lower than men who work in the same professional field. Do I sue my employer because I do not receive the equal rights I deserve? No, and nor do I think this has anything to do with \"equal rights\" because this is a known trend - women's pay tends to be lower than men's when comparing same professions. All men and women are created equal, there is no denial about it. However, we cannot let a small group of people who disregard morality to uproot the most sacred 'a man and a woman' marriage. Passing this as a law will bring further confusion to our younger generations. Once this law is passed, school curriculum will be altered to include same-sex material and our keiki will be taught that same-sex dating and marriage is okay. Won't this be a form of brainwashing to our keiki when our keiki may not be gays or lesbians? Can we all honestly think traditional marriage is a thing of a past? Passing same-sex marriage as a law will further persecute churches who believe in and teach authentic biblical teachings because churches can be sued by same-sex couples who don't get their way of wanting to marry in a church that stands on its ground believing marriage is between a man and woman. Even though many say churches will be exempt from this law, there is no guarantee that same- sex couples won't attempt to get their way by persecuting churches. Please do what is right for the majority of the people in Hawaii who treasure and value the sacred marriage of a man and a woman. Please do not let a small group of people ruin the rest of the folks in Hawaii. This issue has nothing to do with \"equal rights\". This is a deceit from a small group of people who want to chisel away morality and mess up our younger generations. This small group of people don't care about the consequences they may create because they focus nothing but themselves. Sincerely, Eunice SummersFrom: Alissa To: JDLTestimony-WrittenOnly Subject: Special Alissa Altmann PO Box 15079Honolulu, HI 96830 aliholdmann@gmail.com Committee on Judicial and Labor SB 1 - October 28, 2013 at 10:30 AM. Subject: Special Session on Same-Gender Marriage Dear Representatives: Thank you for your commitment to serve and represent the peop le of Hawaii . I truly appreciate that you have committed yourself to such an important calling in life. AsRepresentatives for the people, I ask you to consider and make known among your peers my position on a veryimportant issue. I urge you to vote \"no\" to legalizing same-gender marriage during the speciallegislative session that has been called by Governor Abercrombie on October 28, 2013. My primary concern is the inherent risk that the law would have on my First Amendment rights,to express my freedom of religion, as well as the impact that it would likely have on my churchcommunity and other religious organizations. The bill currently features language intended toprovide religious exemptions to protect churches from being forced to perform same-gendermarriages that are in direct conflict with their beliefs. However, the religious exemptions will notprotect all churches in Hawaii. Further, if forced, it can lead to lengthy and costly lawsuits thatcould lead some churches to eventually close down due to financial costs. This would endimportant community programs that help feed the hungry and provide a wide range of support toHawaii residents in need. Personally, I also stand to lose the right to express my religious views on traditionalmarriage between one man and one woman, whether in the workplace or in public, just asothers are able to express their differing views. I believe that this decision is one that should be made by the people of the State of Hawaii, aswas done in 1998 when it was voted on as a constitutional amendment.I strongly feel that this special session of the legislature does not provide an adequateopportunity for people to voice their opinions. However, if the people of Hawaii will not be given the opportunity to vote on this issue, I ask you to appeal to your fellow lawmakers to take the time necessary to learn more and to also properly revise this bill in order to ensure that no one will lose their existing right to express their religious beliefs as originally granted to all Americans, this also includes protection of families rights with regard to future ramifications within our education systems pertaining to same sex education. There are too many homes across our islands that are wrought with issues, many, I truly believe stem from broken homes. We need to stand on the foundation of \"marriage,\" building our homes, not reconstructing the walls. The people of Hawaii have given special rights to the LGBT community within the civil union law. Please do not forsake the people of the islands with quick decisions, five days of deliberations is not enough time spent on such an important topic! We all need more time to learn more, to make better decisions for ALL groups concerned with this discussion. I trust that you will ensure that these concerns are heard during the special session. Thank you so much for your careful consideration of this matter. Yours truly, Alissa AltmannFrom: Linda Akinaka To: JDLTestimony-WrittenOnly Subject: Same Sex Marriage Legislation Date: Friday, October 25, 2013 6:36:57 PM Aloha, I am requesting that you vote against legalizing same sex marriage here in Hawaii. I believe that traditional marriage is the basis for the foundation of the family, society and our nation. All efforts should be made to preserve and encourage the traditional family and prevent further undermining of marriage and family in our society. Tax exemptions and social security benefits have been endorsed to facilitate those who wish to raise a family and now claims are being made that any type of relationship is entitled to these benefits. If you wish to entitle all types of relationships to these benefits, do it without changing the definition and purpose of marriage. A traditional family has been the basis for Judeo -Christian society since recorded time. It has been the basis for our nation as well. There are biological, physiological and psychological differences between a man and a woman. The success of our society is dependent upon children being raised in a nurturing family with both a father and a mother whose gender differences compliment each other and who are able to procreate. Society's problems have increased as families are challenged with increasing sexual permissiveness, single parent families, and mothers working outside of the home. By calling a same sex union \"marriage\" through legislation, further damage will be done as we are forced to submit to regulations that are against our conscience. The State then becomes an enforcer and a promoter of same sex marriage. As a nation and state we have tried to encourage families by providing benefits to help families as they raise children and perpetuate our society. Same sex partners are unable to have children themselves so it seems that equality in this area is not possible. We voted as a State to define marriage as between a man and a woman. I think it is not right that a few legislators can change that vote. I thank you for your consideration and vote against the Same Sex Marriage bill. Linda Akinaka 4101 1 RELATING TO EQUALITY mailed-by: gmail.com Date: Friday, October 25, 2013 6:29:25 PM Karl Rhoads, Chair Sylvia Luke, Chair House Judiciary Committee House Finance Committee Dear Honorable Chairs Rhoads and Luke and Members of the House Judiciary and Finance Committees: Concerned Women for America of Hawaii does not support S.B. NO. 1 for the following reasons: 1. Hawaii already has a Civil Union Law which currently grants rights to same-sex couples, not only for Hawaii benefits, but for federal benefits, which is not being pointed out in all the news items. 2. The U. S. Supreme Court did not rule that DOMA was unconstitutional, which is what is being incorrectly stated by many here in Hawaii. Therefore, those in a same-sex union in Hawaii would still be allowed to receive federal benefits without requiring them to have their union solemnized. 3. Passing this legislation would be a detriment and a liability for Hawaii, because it would open up doors to allow more intrusion in to our public and private lives as evidenced in those states that have legalized same-sex \"marriage,\" such as California, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Vermont, New Hampshire, Maryland, Maine, Delaware, Rhode Island, Minnesota, Iowa, and New York. Those states which have already legalized same-sex \"marriage\" are showing a host of problems relating to this issue, affecting children for the most part, where they are being taught values that their parents do not accept based upon their religious beliefs. 4. There has not been sufficient time for this bill to be reviewed for its impact as our State Constitution requires. This could have easily waited until our regular session, which will begin in about two months. 5. Same-sex \"marriage\" will be taught in the schools as an acceptable type of marriage, which comes against the religious beliefs of the majority of Hawaii's residents; it is already being done in the states that have legalized same-sex \"marriage.\"6. The reason given \u2014 that by legalizing same-sex \"marriage\" Hawaii will be able to generate more income because same-sex couples will be suddenly flocking to Hawaii to get married in such a romantic spot \u2014 is not very good justification for passing such legislation as S.B. No. 1. 7. This bill should not be passed simply to cater to only 2% of the population instead of listening to the other 98%, especially when an election year is just around the corner. 8. The rush to get this bill through before the end of the year has no real justification. There has not been a reasonable enough answer given by Governor Abercrombie as to why this bill cannot wait until the regular session begins in January. He talks about being able to give same-sex couples tax breaks, when they can receive them easily through a civil union which Hawaii already has, as stated above. 9. When it comes to equality, this legislation should rightfully be brought before the voters of Hawaii, so that they can have an equal opportunity to once again vote on this issue, as they did in 1998, when they thought that vote settled it once and for all. 10. When Governor Abercrombie first called for this Special Session, he said it was just to decide upon this one piece of legislation, because it was important to get it passed before the end of the year. Now there are several other bills that are going to be brought before this Special Session, which will not give enough time for just this one piece of legislation; the Special Session is now expected to last 10 days instead of the original five days. 11. Even before a vote has been taken, Governor Abercrombie is already declaring that he expects this legislation to pass, by putting a date on it as to when he expects it to become law, and he is already preparing the system for a date of November 18, according to news reports.

In addition, legalizing Same Sex Marriage will have a negative effect on the liberties of religious freedom, as it relates to what the Bible holds as God's Truth and Christians' freedom to teach from it. Government should never define moral value and limit the teachings of faith group. Legalizing Same Sex Marriage will put a threat to religious freedom. Therefore, please vote NO on any piece of the Same Sex M arriage bill! Phyllis Young 909 395- 6694/808- 389- 6694 Senator Clayton Hee, Chair Senate Committee on Judiciary and Labor Dear Honorable Chair, Re: TESTIMONY IN OPPOSITION TO SB 1 RELATING TO EQUALITY The issue of same -sex marriage is a hotly debated subject in our state of Hawaii. Many of us know \"good people\" who are practicing the gay/lesbian lifestyle. In my opinion, this is the stumbling block for many. They look at the sampling of \"good gay couple s\" and th ey say that these are good people and should be allowed to be married. Having a limited view stops one from looking further at the facts. In 2011, Governor Abercrombie passed the Civil Unions Law so that sex couples could apply for a civil union which would give them all the benefits that married couples have. This Civil Union Law in Hawaii went into effect on January 1, 2012. As of May 2013, there have been only 916 couples who took advantage of this right to declare themselves as civil union s. This is not a large number and certainly not worthy of the expense and time of a special session. Governor Abercrombie has used the argument that the special session is necessary so that same -sex people here in Hawaii can be married and be able to receive the Federal benefits. But, what is not being said is that same- sex couples can go to any state that recognizes same -sex marriage, solemnize their marri age there, return to Hawaii \u2014where same -sex marriage does not need to be approved \u2014and still receive their Federal benefits. So, if there were under 1,000 couples in Hawaii who took advantage of applying to be recognized as civil unions, why is there a special session going on now \u2014attempting to rush each of you into making an unprecedented decision giving gays th e right to marry? Is this really about equity of marriage or is this a guise to bring about the wishes of a small but vociferous minority of people \u2014the impetus being propelled from those outside of Hawaii? The facts show that the objective of LGBT , as we have witnessed from states such as Massachusetts and even in Toronto, Canada, is not to marry but to change family, church and society itself. Please do acknowledge the fact that there is a large population of gays and lesbians who are extremely militant . This group of LGBT are at war with those who claim that marriage is only between a man and a woman. Know that this goal of legalizing same -sex marriage is but a stepping stone to further their plan. T hey are at war with the churches and the faithful c hurch -going people who still stand on the Word of God and its authority. This militant L GBT group is bright and they have charted their course well. They have already planted their seeds in our schools. They desire to capture the children of today and o f future generations to shape their minds, attitudes and beliefs beginning at the early age of Kindergarten , increasing their dogma as children advance in age. Their very words in the \"Little Black Book\" published in Massachusetts say that this is a wond erful time to be gay because anything goes and there is no limit to the fun one can have with gay sex . They teach that the bible is irrelevant in this age. We have been told that in Canada teacher and students of faith are to park their faith at the scho ol door. Finally, in spite of what the Governor and the attorney general may tell you, churches are not protected by this bill. As long as there is a public accommodation clause in it, NO ONE is exempt. Please show me a church that does not open its door s to non- parishioners. Count the many churches that open its doors to the youth to use their school gymns, allow AA groups to gather for their very important weekly meetings. How many churches on this island participate in the Family Promise program that houses and feeds families giving them a hand up? This bill would also target Catholic Charities and other religious groups as well. I urge you not to rush this extremely important issue at this special session. Vote \"no\" and let the people decide!

Same-sex marriage is not about tolerance. Same-sex homes are already tolerated in society.Same-sex marriage is about putting the legal stamp of approval on homosexuality andforcing its acceptance on citizens and our social, political, and commercial institution. Itforces acceptance for businesses and individuals to recognize same-sex couples in all theirbenefits and activities. Again, I ask you to vote against the SB 1 bill. Thank you. Sincerely, Qi Hui GaoFrom: raina To: JDLTestimony-WrittenOnly Subject: Same Sex Marriage Date: Thursday, October 24, 2013 4:40:25 PM I am very opposing to Same Sex Gender marriage. I believe marriage is very sacred and is ordained of God. Marriage between a man and woman is essential to the family unit and to all mankind. Our society would be in chaos and confusion and ripen for destruction by a the hand of our Lord All Mighty. We would be living as in Sodom and Gomorra. I believe in equal rights, however equal right has it's place. Church and Religion is our right to worship whom we believe to worship and our laws are of a higher power from our Heavenly Father and his son Jesus Christ. Same sexy marriage is an abomination to The Lord. It is by the grace of God that our country remains free and protected, and it is by this hand that we can be destroyed because of immoral and unrighteousness living. Those of us who are God fearing people know this. Those of you who are not see good for evil and evil for good. I stand firm that this abdominal law for same same gender marriage be done away with. My prayers are with you who has the power to make the right decision according to the laws of Heaven and the laws of the land. I believe that the Constitution of the United States was written by men inspired of God. It was written for us to live righteously in this promised land and same gender marriage is wrong. Mahalo,Raina K DudoitPO Box 39, HOOLEHUA, DATE: - CHAIR, S.L. - CHAIR NO of pages (Including cover sheet): 1 COMMENTS: \"Testimony in Opposition to SB1 Relating to Equality\" Please do not pass this bill, Hawaii voted several years ago and killed a similar bill. We the people did vote gay and non gay. Why did the people we elect into office try to revise and pass a similar bill. Sometimes in life you will have to take a stance, I pray that you will stand for traditional marriage, it is not a union, it is two people becoming one. For the sake of Hawaii's future and the future of our keiki, this bill will be the start of a moral and ethic decline here in beautiful Hawaii Nei. I beg of you for my children and my childrens children do not pass this bill. May God be with you. In the name of Jesus, pray on it and do what is right in Gods eyes, once you go forward it will be hard to reverse your actions. Ask for Godly wisdom in everything that you do. Please. Aloha Ramona AsatoFrom: Ann Allred To: JDLTestimony-WrittenOnly Subject: Against the passage of SB1 10/28/13 10:30 am - Written Testimony Committee on Judiciary and Labor Date: Thursday, October 24, 2013 1:32:03 PM Aloha. You, our elected representatives, have an obligation to hear the voice of the people and to legislate in our behalf. Our family joins with many, many families here in Hawaii who believe in the sanctity of the family and of the bond of marriage between a man and a woman. Strong families are the foundation of our society. Our island tradition supports strong families and religious values. Our family also holds dear the freedom to practice our religion. While we do not condemn others for not living our values, we also feel that being able to believe and live our values should not be limited by others. The proposed legislation threatens these freedoms. We ask that you please NOT PASS this bill before you. Let the people speak their mind to assure you that, as in 1998, we still believe marriage means the union of one man and one woman. Thank you for your attention. Randal and Ann Allred and Family ; Rep. Faye Hanohano ; Rep. Richard Onishi ; Rep. Clifton K. Tsuji ; Rep. Mark Nakashima ; Rep. Nicole Lowen ; Rep. Cindy Evans ; Rep. Denny Coffman ; Sen. Josh Green ; Sen. Gilbert Kahele ; Sen. Malama Solomon Subject: Not in Favor: SB1 Date: Friday, October 25, 2013 6:47:28 AM My name is Raymond Glory, Jr, and I am a life long resident of Hawai'i island. I was born in Kohala, and have lived in Volcano Village, for the past 24 years. I am against SB1 for the following reasons: 1. The convening of this special session for an issue that has such far reaching ramifications should have the full two thirds support of both the house and the senate. The fact that it does not and that the governor chooses to convene the special session anyway, is of great concern to me. 2. An issue of this magnitude should include as much input from the citizens as possible. This special session does not do that, as it is limited to only 5 or 6 days. To compound matters, if I want to testify in person, I have to fly to Honolulu to do it as there are no accommodations for in-person, neighbor island testifiers. This is discriminatory and abusive to neighbor island citizens. 3. It should be the goal of the legislature to write and pass into law the best bill possible to best serve all of the citizens of the state. The fact that the bill before the legislature cannot be amended is baffling, and leaves me with the impression that the input from the citizens, the house representatives, the senators ~ for that matter, everybody except the drafters of the bill ~ is not relevant or welcome. The bill is a \"take it or leave it\" document, and doesn't look at all like democracy in the United States of America. Please vote against the bill. Sincerely, Raymond Glory, Jr.P.O. Box 995Volcano, HI 96785(808) 967-8444Submission from Rebecca Wolfersberger for SB1 We OPPOSE SB 1 Hawaii Marriage Equality Act for the following reasons: 1. This debate seems to be focusing on the rights of consenting adults; but the rights of children are being ignored. Children have a right to be raised by their biological parents whose commitment to each other is attested to by the covenant of marriage. Whi le recognising that this is an ideal, and that in practice mothers and fathers can be separated by death, by divorce or by lack of commitment, the fact remains that research supports the finding that children raised by both their biological parents who rem ain committed to each other do better on all measures of well -being. There will always be notable exceptions, but we should not be deconstructing the ideal of an institution which appears to be contributing to the general well -being of children. 2. Parents ne ed to establish their relationship as a role model for their children. If the definition of marriage is altered to include same gender couples it sends mixed messages to children and contributes to gender confusion. The following is excerpted from an artic le entitled Caring for Your School Age Child: Ages 5 - 12(Copyright \u00a9 2004 American Academy of Pediatrics updated 30/12/2011. \"The gender -role behavior of children seems to be strongly influenced by their identification with the males and females in their lives. All children pick up characteristics from the men and women around them, incorporating these traits into their own personalities and value systems. They are also influenced by TV and sports heroes and adults in all other activities in their lives. Over time, the combined effect of these many influences may determine many of their masculine and feminine qualities. Perhaps more than any other factor, the subtleties of every child's relationship with his or her father and mother \u2014and the attitudes of th e parents toward each other and toward the child \u2014will influence his or her gender -related behaviors. \" (Retrieved 15 October, 2012 from 3. The media has done a speedy job of changing public opinion on this issue in recent years. Marriage was once a sacred instution that was a clear pillar of society. To so quickly change to a new standard without examining the lasting effects it might have on society, and children in particular, is rash. Marriage as an institution should not be altered on the whim of the media when society as a whole is affected. We look to our politicians to show moral leadership in society, rather than lead the down ward charge. 4. The Judeo -Christian tradition sees marriage as being ordained of God between a man and a woman. It also calls on men and women to be chaste before marriage and faithful in marriage. It calls on parents take responsibility for the raising of their children in love and kindness. In its ideal form it is an institution worth defending and deserving of our support. If strong families are the building blocks of a strong country, and a strong society, then nothing will endanger our future more than th e undermining of the family proposed in this Hawaii Marriage Equaliy Act. 5. The United States of America was built on Christian values that are inherent in the Judeo -Christian ethic and even though today it has become a much more secular society, and many o f the Christian values have been eroded in the face of an evolving permissiveness, the influence of these values still permeates our culture. The erosion of these values and their positive moderation of human behaviour start with the idea, \"I don't agree w ith this, but we live in a democratic country and I respect your right to think differently from the way I do.\" Having given way once, we become seduced by the logic of this argument and move to a tolerance which normalises practices which were previously regarded as not normal. Soon we embrace them wholeheartedly and their widespread acceptance means that those who try to remain faithful to the original premise are vilified and treated with less respect than those who lead the downward slide. This proce ss can be seen in a range of issues: (i) The abandonment of the sanctity of Sunday as the Sabbath day (ii) The abandonment of the notion of chastity before marriage and fidelity in marriage (iii) The notion of no -fault divorce (iv) Increasing violence and promiscuity of lifestyles promoted in the media (v) Lowering of the drinking age and proliferation of liquor outlets (including supermarkets) (vi) The decriminalisation of prostitution (vii) Increasing dishonesty in business, politics and indeed in all aspects of life (viii) The tolerance of sexually explicit material in movies and TV (and on the internet) The results of this can be seen in: (i) The lack of spiritual reflection and refreshing which can accompany a day set aside for that purpose (ii) Increasing numbers of children born out of wedlock and raised in single parent homes (iii) Increasing incidence of intergenerational welfare dependency related to the above (iv) Increasing incidence of violence to children by partners of solo mother s (and failure of solo mothers to protect their children) (v) Increasing incidence of divorce with its concomitant negative impact on the lives of children (vi) Increasing incidence of promiscuity and incidence of sexually transmitted diseases (vii) Increasing incidence of violent crime (viii) Increasing participation by disenfranchised and disaffected youth (product of dysfunctional families) in gangs with the accompanying rise in gang related crime (ix) Increasing incidence of binge drinking and alc oholism (and drug use) among young people squandering the potential of their future life opportunities (x) Increasing incidence of theft as a servant, fraud, embezzlement, misrepresentation, political dishonesty (xi) Increasing incidence of pornography a ddicition among (particularly) males of all ages. It is interesting that we are permissive with regards to adult pornography but not to child pornography. As with any addiction, one thing leads to another. If we wish to reduce and even eliminate child porn ography, we should be as strict on adult pornography. A stand in favour of protecting the institution of marriage and against the amending of the definition of marriage to allow same sex marriage unfortunately inevitably attracts the ire of the proponen ts of this legislation. The Judeo -Christian ethic teaches us to strive to live peaceably with one another. We have no desire to denigrate those with same -gender attraction. In summary, we do, however, desire to reject this act because: Summary: 1. It fails to take account of the rights of children to be part of a family environment which will give them the best chance of success in life. 2. In confuses the clarity of appropriate gender models for children. 3. The media has overinfluenced society i nto beliefs about same -sex marriage without considering the effects on society as a whole. Politicians need to show moral leadership and consider the potential for long -term negative downstream consequences that could flow from this redefinition. 4. Marria ge is an institution worth protecting for the strong value it has on creating strong families, the building -block of our society. 5. Traditional values have positive worth in maintaining much that is good in society. Clayton Hee, Chair Senate Committee on Judiciary and Labor Re: TESTIMONY IN OPPOSITION TO SB 1 RELATING TO EQUALITY Dear Honorable Chair Hee and Members of the Committee on Judiciary and Labor: To begin, I would like to thank you for your service to our state and the sacrifices you have made to represent the state of Hawaii and its interests. Please know that I pray for you and your job, and while I take an interest in the politics of the state, your job is to work at it every day and I want thank you for your willingness to do that for the people of Hawaii. I want to voice my concern for the upcoming bill up for consideration in the legislature. I deeply troubled by the speed at which this bill is being handled, especially with the society changing impli cations that it represents. Though it may seem that much time has been spent on this bill, the truth is that all the ongoing debate back and forth about it, and the research that is surfacing, it is clear that this is not something that should be rushed an d decided on so quickly for you as our leaders and representatives. To do so would jeopardize the trust the people have in the government and thus tear apart the necessary unity needed between both in order to see positive change happen. If this bill is pa ssed, there will be ramifications that will affect generations to come, whether you have read about the other states that have moved in the direction of approving bills like this one. I come to you as a father of 2 sons who are barely starting their educat ion, and with the possibility of education being affected because of this issue in the future , it is crucial that the people of Hawaii get their voice heard. I hope that you as our representatives will recognize all sides of the issue, and make sure that y ou are making the right decision, what is best for all the peo ple of Hawaii, not just a few. While I oppose the bill, my main concern is that you have carefully thought through what this will mean for the future of Hawaii. There is a cost to the people of Hawaii that they must be made aware of. We cannot ignore the history of things that have passed and the changes that have occurred because of bills like this in other states. We cannot afford to make mistakes in the decision making process of Hawaii. It is essential that choose carefully and take time to make wise decisions. Decisions like this could cost our state more than we are ready for. I implore you to give the people of Hawaii the time to make the decision and not take it upon yourself to make the decision. You may regret it if you are not certain on both sides of the issue, not just one. I appreciate your time in hearing my concerns and testimony . I hope this will help to focus your efforts as you consider your next steps. I know that the job you do is not easy, and I offer this word of encouragement to you to see that you find a moment to think through with wisdom and clarity. I hope that this will help you in the days ahead. Good luck with your decision upcoming and again thank you for your serv ice to our state. Sincerely, Robert JDLTestimony October 26, 2013 8:56:10 PM Dear Chair Hee and Members of the Committee on Judiciary and Labor: First, I want to thank you for your hard work and your heart to serve the people of Hawaii, trying to help protect our state and make life better for everyone. I am asking you to vote NO at the special session regarding the proposed Same Sex Marriage Bill (SB1). I am opposed to redefining the meaning of the word \"marriage\". The definition of marriage in the United States has always been a legal union between one man and one woman (except for a period where polygamy was practiced by some of those of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints--which has since been outlawed.) If this bill is passed and becomes law, I am concerned about the effect on the culture, values, and the rich pro family pro life traditions of Hawaii. There have been many instances in other states and countries where same sex marriage has been legalized where this change in law has greatly affected curriculum in schools, and the freedom ofparents to speak and teach their children according to their moral beliefs. Have you researched and analyzed the effects on those states (like Massachusetts) and places (like Canada) that have already made same sex marriage legal? It has been shown that some of the LGBT leaders have specific plans to change school curriculum and to change laws about churches being able to follow their faith in choosing whetheror not to perform marriages, etc. based on their belief systems. Individuals and businesses who are not gay orlesbian should have freedom to live out their beliefs also. I ask you to vote NO on SB1 until we, the people of Hawaii, can see what has happened in other places and decide if this is/will be in the BEST interests of the people of Hawaii. If you vote no on this issue, it will give time forgreater research, debate and input from Hawaii's people. I believe that, regarding this issue, you will best serve thepeople by letting each one of us have a vote in determining the outcome that we are being asked to live by. Thank you for reading my testimony and considering my opinion, Robin S. Ventura, registered voter3439 Anuwanu PlaceMakawao, HI 96768Clayton Hee, Chair 10/28/13 Senate Committee on Judiciary and Labor Re: TESTIMONY IN OPPOSfflON TO SB 1 RELATING TO EQUALITY Dear Honorable Chair Hee and Members of the Committee on Judiciary and Labor: My wife and I arrived in Hawaii in 1998 and after retiring from the military, we chose to stay in Hawaii because we believed there was no better place to raise our eleven children. We loved the culture and spirit of mutual respect, community support for families and we wanted pass along to our children the religious/moral values that were given to us by our parents. But this bill threatens to change everything. For this reason and the following, I offer this testimony against SB-1: First, Same Sex Marriage is NOT a civil right. As a boy, I lived in the Washington DC area during the Civil Rights era of the early 1960's. As an undergraduate and graduate student, I studied American history and politics. To include sexual preference in the same category as a civil right is to grossly cheapen sacrifices made for true civil rights. Second, please do NOT ignore the studies that explain the pain/guilt placed on children raised in same sex environments. The studies are rigorous and comprehensive. And the results are compelling--\"marriage\" is NOT appropriate for people who live a gay/lesbian life style. In fact, one of my adult daughters who has lived in the lesbian world for the past decade strongly agrees \"marriage\" is NOT appropriate for people who live a homosexual life style. Finally, this Special Session does not reflect the desires of the public-we did not ask for it, it expends time/money that we do not have to waste and because this bill will change Hawaii's culture forever, I urge you to let the people decide! We respectfully request you vote NO. Thank you for the opportunity to testify against this special session and against this bill.

Sincerely , Rolan d From: Ronette Taeoalii To: JDLTestimony Subject: Special Session Same Sex Marriage Bill Date: Sunday, October 27, 2013 8:34:56 AM Thank you for your time. I am opposed to the Same Sex Marriage Bill because I feel the purpose of marriage is to create and raise happy and healthy families. By nature, we create another human being through the union of a man and a woman. More emphasis needs to be placed on the responsibility of our society to engage in healthy relationships that foster the growth and development of happy and healthy families. The decline of our society can be linked directly to the disintegration of the nuclear family. Please revisit the Same Sex Marriage Bill and allow your constituents to study this legislation. The implications of passing a same sex marriage bill will affect society in many ways yet unforeseen. I am asking that you allow the people to decide and have the opportunity to cast a vote reflecting our respect for the choices of one another.

If you are a photographer, cake maker, musician entertainer and you disagree to perform at these functions you can legally be sued by the couple to comply or get a fine.But i believe i have conscience exception and I should be afforded the right to waive suc h occasions because I find it offensive to my GOD.Freedom of religion was so important that the founders listed it twice in the Bill of rights.Same way a doctor has the right not to perform an abortion because it interferes with his or her religious belief i should be afforded the same protections when being forced to do anything else offensive to my beliefs as well. Doctors and nurses are vendors in the medical profession and are paid for their services, i do not see any difference in the services that i provide that disqualify me from this ruling. Mahalo Sam Langi JrFrom: Mmoorelvi75@aol.com To: JDLTestimony-WrittenOnly Date: Wednesday, October 23, 2013 9:45:00 PM Aloha, I am a citizen, voter, and US Army veteran native to Hawaii. I married my husband 14 1/2 years ago, traditionally, in the sight of God. I oppose same sex marriage. I don't oppose another's beliefs, but the fact that a single legal document, supported by a reverend and witnesses, in the sight of God, puts my husband and I under the sacred status of \"Married\" could possibly be redefined for the purpose of equal benefits and tax purposes, degrades the sacredness of \"Holy Matrimony.\" The definition of marriage / same sex marriage should be voted upon by the very people who voted everyone into office, not behind closed doors and rushed into. Expenses for this special session could be used toward education - perhaps air conditioning for Campbell High School. (I'm not bias, I'm a Kailua grad...) Again, I oppose same sex marriage and I thank you. My prayers are out to everyone in legislature. Mahalo and Aloha,Samlynn N Moore, wife, mother of 3, sister of a lesbian, cousin and friend to many, many gays and lesbians, believer of Jesus Christ, Lord and Savior. From: Sandy Coons To: JDLTestimony-WrittenOnly Date: Wednesday, October 23, 2013 3:56:00 PM I would like to add my voice to the testimony about recognizing same-sex marriage. I am asking the senate and house to vote NO on same sex marriage. I believe that marriage is a holy covenant designed by our God, and designed for a man-woman union, in Him. It is very simple, really. Read your Bible, and learn what our God says about marriage. Then, follow His Word, which is righteous. Thank you! Secondly, this special session being called to pass a bill recognizing same-sex marriage is not democracy. Let the people decide, in a vote of all the people.Sincerely, Sandra CoonsTo Whom it May Concern, October 26, 2013 I, Jamee Adams, of Hilo, HI, submit below my testimony in opposition to SB1. I oppose two aspects of this bill, and innumerate them below: 1) I oppose that this bill is being submitted in a special legislative session as opposed to an open vote for the people of Hawaii. I understand that this legislative vote was made possible in 1998, but I still feel that most residents did not understand the rights and choices they were giving up at the time. (People thought that they were voting on an amendment to the Hawaii Constitution to solidify marriage between one man and one woman as the only definition of marriage in the state of Hawaii - not realizing they were giving up their right to vote on this issue to their legislative representatives.) It is taking advantage of the ignorance of many - and it is painful for those like myself who feel they understand the consequences of both the previous and current legislation. I am asking that you as honorable legislators give the vote back to the people of Hawaii. It should not have been presented in such a difficult and confusing way in the first place and to piggy-\u00adback on that previous decision does not suddenly make this bill in special session constitutional. 2) I oppose the wording in the bill that suggests that business and religious organizations will be forced to conduct or otherwise sanction same-\u00adsex marriages in their buildings. I am very worried that this legislation will lead to lawsuits or forcible action on the part of the minority against the perceived \"bigoted\" or \"religious\" - even if they are neither. Regardless of religious choice, Americans still have the personal freedom to control personal property and privately-\u00adowned spaces. As a precedent in other states (MA, WA, NM, NY), we are already seeing legal action being brought against those who deny access to their businesses or places of worship. That is not right and I fear that this legislation will allow for this infringement. Thank you for your service to our community and your consideration of my testimony. Sincerely, Jamee Adams 734 Lahou St. Hilo, HI 96720 Dear Sir, First and foremost, I appreciate being a resident in Hawaii for twenty -four years. I thank you for all the hard work and support you've shown for the People in Hawaii. Please spend a couple of minutes to read this and kindly consider my request . I am a Social Worker at Catholic Charities Hawaii. It's been 24 years since I moved from N. Dakota to Hawaii. The freedom and respect for the People in Hawaii have kept me to stay here as long as I could. Having said that, I would like to be very direc t by asking you to consider voting no to the \"Same Sex Marriage\" bill during the Special Session on Oct 28th, and let the People of Hawaii decide it. Being a devoted Christian that is deeply involved with serving the immigrants and nurturing the next gener ation of youth, I clearly see the values of keeping traditional marriage and family structure intact for the sake of our present and future generations. Deep down in our hearts, we all know that same sex marriage is against the nature of human beings, that is, we are born to have marriage with opposite sex in order to reproduce off springs and establish families for the society to function. Once again and simply put, I sincerely ask you to please let the People of Hawaii decide this on our own. This Speci al Session, unfortunately, does not represent the majority of the People's voice in Hawaii. Respectfully, Selina Lau 2033 2013 8:55:29 AM To Whom It May Concern: Aloha! First of all, I want to thank you for all that you do representing the people of Hawaii. We are blessed to be living in this beautiful islands and sharing the aloha with one another. Raising our kids and now grandkids here in Hawaii has been such a great joy. I believe in a family with a father and mother where the children grow up learning where we came from, why we are here, and where we are going. With this being said, I want to show my concern on the Bill #SB1. I am against the Same-sex Marriage. I want the people of Hawaii to voice their opinions and I hope you at the Capitol will let the people of Hawaii vote regarding this bill. I hope you will realize that the best for Hawaii is AGAINST SAME-SEX MARRIAGE. SB 1 RELATING TO EQUALITY. Date: Sunday, October 27, 2013 10:24:25 AM Dear Honorable Chair and Members of the Committee on Judiciary and Labor, My name is Shanita Akana. I am from Ewa Beach, Hawaii. I am in opposition to SB 1 relating to Equality. A government that seeks to overthrow an 'already decided upon' definition of marriage is unfair, unjust, and inconsiderate of the voice of the people. Gay and lesbian couples already receive benefits through the Civil Unions bill passed in 2011. Career politicians lack compassion, although they offer consideration by allowing me to put forth my testimony, in the end, they vote party lines and this is very disturbing. Please do not subject the people of Hawaii to the ways of Massachusetts. The repercussions are devastating and the worst ripple effect is re-writing school-aged textbooks in our public schools to include the teachings of a homosexual nature, which is not natural, but man-made. I am a 47 year old wife and mother, tolerant to all human beings, their creed, color, sexual orientation, etc., but will not let this one go as the future of my children and grandchildren are at stake. If you believe in good education for our children, let the lessons of moral principals stand in all classrooms in society, including the textbooks that law students read from. It is unbelievable that states that passed the SSM bill have to re-write their law textbooks to include language of same sex unions. Let's not go down that path. You cannot infringe upon the personal religious beliefs of others. Our United States Constitution guards against this, well at least that's what I learned from my former educators and in the textbooks written during my high school and college years. As a strong Catholic Christian, I ask all politicians who are still on the fence, to vote your conscience. Do what is morally right. Stand on moral principals. You do not need to change your vote to 'change with the times' as the senator from my district put it. One day, when you stand before God, he will say to you, \"Well done my good and faithful servant. Enter.\" And to those who allowed the evil forces to influence them, God will say, \"Depart from me you evil doer, I do not know you.\" Our time on earth are numbered. Make it count. \"Do what is morally right, not what you feel\"~ a phrase I would often use on my own children, guiding them throughout their growing up years. My sons are now 25, 23, and 21. Children learn what they live....children live what they learn. Sincerely, Shanita Akana (wife to John Akana, mother to 2013 2:35:13 PM Aloha Mr. McKelvey and All Representatives of the People of the State of Hawaii, As a registered voter in our beautiful and loving State, I would like to make my thoughts known to you concerning the 'Same Sex Marriage' initiative that you have been called upon by our Governor to vote on and represent the needs of the people of your districts. Remember when we, the People, voted on this same issue several years ago? We, the People, voted that we did not want to change the definition of \"Marriage\" to include same sex marriage partners. It was a solid majority of our People who asked that \"Marriage\" remain as defined, only between a man and a woman. You accepted our vote at that time. Why do you now believe that we would change our minds so quickly on something that is so vital to the health and welfare of Families, as Families have been defined since time immemorial? We are not that wishy-washy, we know what is right and what is not right! Now that the Governor wants to 'go around' the voting of the People, Please vote NO on this measure and respect the wishes of the people of Hawaii. Mahalo for doing the \"will of the People\", as you campaigned to do when you were elected, Shannon L.

My values are liberty, social justice, compassion and respect for the dignity and worth of the individual. The inherent dignity and equal and inalienable rights of all human beings are the foundations of freedom, justice, and peace. I support the separation of State and Church as set forth in the Constitution of the United States of America in the First Amendment as well as Article VI, and believe this right is meant to support equality, not erode it. Separation of State and Church is meant to insure that no single religion can impose its particular beliefs on members of the general population. I support SB1 Please note that testimony submitted less than 24 hours prior to the hearing , improperly identified, or directed to the incorrect office, may not be posted online or distributed to the committee prior to the convening of the public hearing.

American Chinese are very serious about family. We tell the youth that taking care the elderlies in the family is their duty. We finance businesses through family. We borro w money to buy properties through family. We obtain the best education through family. We know from our hearts that we need love from father and mother, so we apply the same to others. Our children need love from their father and mother as we do. Same Se x Marriage bill is going to destroy Chinese tradition. We want our local boys and girls know that rearing family biologically is the best. We want to give the best to our future. Therefore, please vote NO on any pi ece of the Same Sex Marriage bil l! From: Sharon Martin To: JDLTestimony Subject: RE: TESTIMONY IN OPPOSITION TO SB 1 RELATING TO EQUALITY - MRS. SHARON T. MARTIN Date: Friday, October 25, 2013 12:26:09 PM Dear Honorable Chair Hee and Members of the Committee on Judiciary and Labor: I am a voting resident residing in Kaneohe. I am adamantly opposed to the proposed Senate Bill 1 relating to Marriage Equality. I urge all of you to consider the destructive ramifications of the passage of such a Bill on traditional families, our school educational system (state as well as private), our businesses, and on every individual in our state. This Bill tramples on our first amendment right - The Right of Religion and Expression. I believe in God's definition of marriage between one man and one woman and stand by His Word. I urge you to NOT approve this Senate Bill. Mahalo to you all for your time, consideration, and all that you do for our beautiful State. With warm regards, Mrs. Sharon T. MartinPharmacist, Castle Medical CenterWife and 2013 12:53:13 PM Aloha! As a resident of Hawaii, I would like to take this time to ask you to stop the Special Session on Marriage Equality and let the people vote on marriage. We are only 2 months away from a Regular Session, so what's the rush with this Special Session? Also, marriage is not equality and it does not need to be redefined! When they changed the law about race, they didn't change the definition of race, When they made a law that women were allowed to vote, they didn't change the definition of women or voting. So why change the definition of marriage? I heard polls shows that majority of Hawaii wants same-gender marriage, but I was never asked about that! So if that's what they say, why not let the people vote? Do you know what will happen if this bill passes? If you don't, read about what happened to Massachusetts and how their state is falling apart. It will also happen to us, if we don't do anything about it. Our children will be learning from kindergarden how to have gay sex. I'm not a parent yet, but I do want kids, and I would not want my children to learn about sex at such a young age. Please consider to kill this bill or let the people of Hawaii vote on marriage! Thank you for your time!Mahalo,Shayna Saturday, October 26, 2013 10:22:28 AM To: Senate Committee on Judiciary and Labor Hearing Date/Time: Monday, October 28, 2013, 10:30 a.m.Place: Capitol Auditorium Re: Strong Opposition of SB1 Dear Chair Hee and Members of the Committee on Judiciary and Labor: I am writing to voice my opposition to Bill SB1. I oppose this bill due to the lack of the democratic process. The majority of Hawaii DOES NOT WANT SAME SEX MARRIAGE as a law. The ramifications of this law has not been well thought through, religions are not protected fairly, businesses are not protected fairly, and rushing this bill through will have negative consequences for sure...just do the research with the states that have passed this law. Yes, in 1998, we voted to \"grant the Hawaii State Legislature the power to reserve marriage to opposite-sex couples,\" only because that's what was worded. It should've said, \"Marriage in the state of Hawaii is reserved between one man and one woman.\" But it was worded that way so that you could do what you're doing today,which is not how our constitution works. This is not the best way to go about the most critical issue facing our time. You know as well as I do, the way it's being done and the way the bill is worded, VIOLATES THE FIRST AMENDMENT OF THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. Thank you for the opportunity to SB1 Date: Saturday, October 26, 2013 8:04:14 AM Dear Legislators, I am writing to you to oppose Bill SB1 Relating to equal rights And Recognizing marriages of same-sex.I am a human resources professional and a mother of three children. I strongly feel that this bill, should it be passed, will negatively impact families and our community. It will result in the loss of religious freedom for many religiousleaders, organizations, individuals and small businesses. More importantly, It will also redefine marriage and as such will contribute to the deterioration of the traditional family which will lead to the eventual downfall of oursociety. I truly hope that you will take my consideration to heart and consider not passing SB-1.Mahalo, Sheri-Lyn AngalaMililani residentFrom: shirley OPPOSITION TO SB 1 RELATING TO EQUALITY Date: Sunday, October 27, 2013 12:55:23 AM Dear Honorable Chair Hee and Members of the Committee on Judiciary and Labor: I would like to inform you that I am not in favor of SENATE BILL 1 as in infringes onwhat our \"Church Miracle Faith Apostolic Global Church believes. We believe that God has ordanined over 2000 years ago that marriage is between one man and one woman. We believe that \"Matrimony\" is one of the seventh sacraments that God provided for a man and awoman. Marriage is a supernatural act performed by the divine grace of God so that two human beings a male and female becomes one flesh. \"Our Lord said in the Bible letno man separate what he had put together.\" This Senate Bill 1 is separating the Marriage Law that God had provided for a man and a woman. Couples of the same sex have already been given Civil Union Rights. By changing the Law of marriage to allow them to marry is taking away our rights and beliefs that marriage is aliving sacrament from God, Holy between one man and one woman. I am asking you to please reconsider my testimony and not pass Senate Bill 1 and allowthe people to vote on this issue. Shirley P. Ching, Ministered member with Chrisitian Date: Thursday, October 24, 2013 5:59:29 PM Dear members of the Committee on Judiciary and Labor, I am a constituent of Senate district 4 and want to voice my opinion concerning SB 1. I am against same sex marriage and want my elected officials to vote against SB 1. Several years ago the people of Hawaii voted on their ballots against same sex marriage the now the Governor has taken it upon himself to promote the cause of a FEW in the state who have loud voices. SB 1 has language that is not specific and could cause churches to lose their religious freedom. It is a poorly worded bill and needs refinement at the least and be dismissed entirely at its best.

I'm 63 years old, homosexual all the days of my life. l stopped \"practicing\" in 1984 when I became a Christian. When two male pipes or two female pipes can be joined to provide water; when two tabs or two slots can be joined to build a project; when two plugs or two outlets can be joined to provide electricity; or when two men or two women can be joined to produce a child without the aid of the opposite sex, I'll be for same sex marriage. Anyone who thinks there is nothing wrong with homosexuality is in denial. We are a bunch of lost sheep looking for love in all the wrong places. Legally speaking, why do married people have benefits single people don't? Maybe we singles should start our own \"civil rights\" movement.

For assistance please email webmaster@capitol.hawaii.govHonorable Senator Hee, Thank you for the opportunity to submit testimony on Senate Bill 1. I would like to share a little bit about myself so that you might know what I'm asking and why it's important not to just me, but to society and our great nation as a whole. I am a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter -day Saints, colloquially k nown as the Mormons. I'm sure you are well aware of my church's stance on same -sex marriage, so I won't spend more time on that other than to say we believe it to be an immoral practice and detrimental to society. However, something that isn't often focuse d on as much is our belief in agency. While I believe homosexuality is immoral, I also believe very strongly in our right to choose for ourselves. In fact, one of our Articles of Faith states: \"We claim the privilege of worshiping Almighty God according to the dictates of our own conscience, and allow all men the same privilege, let them worship how, where, or what they may.\" (italics added) I am deeply concerned that in our society's pursuit of the right for same -sex couples to marry, freedom of religion and the rights of churches will be eroded. Please do what is in your power to ensure that any bill considered in favor of same -sex marriage also protects the rights of churches and businesses to conduct themselves in accordance with their own moral codes. While I personally believe that government has no right to define marriage at all, it is what it is and I cannot let this opportunity pass by without adding my voice to the conversation. Thank you for your time and consideration and for all that you do i n service to our community. I hope that adding my thoughts and perspective will aid you and others in the legislative process in protecting ALL freedom and "}
