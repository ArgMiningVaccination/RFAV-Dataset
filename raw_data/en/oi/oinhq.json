ROBERT GARCIA, HOST: No nudity, though. BARTOS: (Laughter) Unless you're thinking about naked people... GARCIA: (Laughter). ERYKAH BADU: I make sure that I get the five doctors in every day - a little Dr. Sun, a little Dr. Nutrition, make sure I'm eating right and drinking a lot, a lot of water. GARCIA: What about (singing) Dr. Love, Doctor... (LAUGHTER) BADU: Dr. Love is on vacation. (LAUGHTER) BADU: Dr. Love tired. (SOUNDBITE OF JAMES BROWN'S \"CHASE\") BARTOS: Yo, yo, yo. Hello, everybody. This is Stretch Armstrong. GARCIA: (Speaking Spanish) Bobbito Garcia (speaking Spanish). (LAUGHTER) BARTOS: Welcome to Season 2 of WHAT'S GOOD WITH STRETCH & BOBBITO... GARCIA: Bobbito. BARTOS: ...Your source for untold stories and uncovered truths from movers and shakers around the world. GARCIA: We are talking art, music, film and, sometimes, sports. BARTOS: And everything in between. GARCIA: That's right. Yo, (unintelligible) it feels good to be back in the studio. BARTOS: My man. GARCIA: Yeah. It's been a couple months... BARTOS: It's good - can I say it's good to be home? GARCIA: No - for sure. NPR's our new home. BARTOS: That's right. GARCIA: They're never going to turn their back on us, and we're going to be doing this for the next 15, 20 years. Can I put that in the universe? BARTOS: Put it out there. GARCIA: All right. BARTOS: Man. Yo, it is great to be back. Bob, you have been ridonculously (ph) busy since... GARCIA: (Laughter). BARTOS: ...Season 1 ended. GARCIA: Yeah. I mean, I put out my third film, \"Rock Rubber 45s\"... BARTOS: (Clapping). GARCIA: Thank you, which - I have to applaud you for be so supportive... BARTOS: A tour de force. GARCIA: ...You know? But, Stretch, the same could be said for you. You put out a book. You've been touring the world. I feel like you have exponentially been DJing a lot more, you know, Central Park SummerStage. You did - what DJ does Central Park SummerStage as a headliner in the same season? BARTOS: Huah (ph). GARCIA: (Laughter). BARTOS: There were a lot of years when I never got invited to SummerStage... GARCIA: Yeah... BARTOS: ...So I'm trying to make up. GARCIA: So we're going to start the second season with a banger of an interview. I mean, you know, who could expect that our first season would launch with Dave Chappelle as our guest, Donnell Rawlings accompanying him and then a surprise phone call... BARTOS: Call-in. GARCIA: ...At the end with Erykah Badu? And now... BARTOS: That's right. GARCIA: ...She's returning back, cosmically, to be the first guest for our launch of the second season. BARTOS: That's right. And it's a real treat. I mean, she's just, you know, a legend, a singer of the highest caliber. She's a songwriter, a performer, an actress, a prolific social media empress... GARCIA: (Laughter). BARTOS: ...And a doula. GARCIA: Certified at that... BARTOS: Certified, licensed to doula. GARCIA: You mentioned she's a legend, right? And what does she have, like, five albums? Like, you know, you think about, like, Tito Puente, for example, you know? He's recorded over a hundred albums in his career. Like, Erykah has attained bona fide legendary status without a lot of recorded output but a plethora of live performances that I don't know too many artists that could really be held in the same breath with how hard she's been working for the last 20, 20-plus years. It's crazy. BARTOS: Yeah. And she'll get into that... GARCIA: She will. BARTOS: ...So we don't want to reveal too much... GARCIA: OK. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. (LAUGHTER) GARCIA: But she's legendary. She's award-winning. She's done guest appearances on other people's recordings. BARTOS: And she's hilarious. GARCIA: She's hilarious. And Badu is in the building. Stay tuned. She's right up next. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GARCIA: Who's playing the drums? BARTOS: Who's playing the spoons? OF BARTOS: up? Time Peace Peace. BARTOS: Erykah. BADU: How are you? BARTOS: Fantastic. How are you... GARCIA: I'm better now. BADU: I'm exquisite. (LAUGHTER) GARCIA: So what's your daily routine like? I mean, you doing shows. You out here taking care of kids, delivering babies. Do you have a Google calendar? Do you have a datebook? Do you write... BADU: I'm supposed to have one, but I don't - I never look at it. Right now, it's pretty much - my datebook is my text messages. Like, you're supposed to be here. Oh, OK. I'm on my way. During fall or autumn - during the school year, I wake up at about 6 a.m., 5:59, 6 a.m., and I take my daughter to school, my youngest daughter. And from there, I'll go to the gym or to yoga depending on what day it is. And from there, I go to my grandmother's house. I'm one of her caregivers. And she's 91. GARCIA: Wow. BADU: And... BARTOS: Bless her. BADU: Yeah. And then, you know, I try to leave there around 1 p.m. to have a little bit of me time. And, hopefully, traffic is heavy enough where I can write a song to one of these old-ass beats I've been trying to write to for eight years. (LAUGHTER) BADU: But there's never enough traffic... (LAUGHTER) BADU: ...To finish. So that's pretty much my fall routine. And then, if I have a mom that I'm assisting or caring for, I fit that in. Pretty much, that's it. And I try to get a little bit of time for me. I make sure that I get the five doctors in every day - a little sun, Dr. Sun, my little - Dr. Nutrition make sure I'm eating right and drinking a lot of water. Dr. Exercise, you know, in the morning getting the gym in or the yoga, whatever it is or walking or whatever. Spirit part, where I'm alone in my car, and I am able to communicate... GARCIA: Yeah. BADU: ...With the higher things. And then, five, just Dr. Breath, making sure I'm breathing correctly. So I try to get all of that in every day. GARCIA: What about (singing) Dr. Love? Dr... (LAUGHTER) BADU: Dr. Love is on vacation. (LAUGHTER) BADU: Dr. Love tired. (LAUGHTER) BADU: Dr. Love is tired. GARCIA: You know that song, right? BADU: (Singing) Dr. Love. Yeah. GARCIA: Oh. BARTOS: Oh. BADU: (Laughter). BARTOS: (LAUGHTER) BADU: (Vocalizing). (SOUNDBITE OF SPOONS BANGING) GARCIA: I've heard that you travel quite often with your family and... BADU: I do. GARCIA: ...You know, I find that intriguing. I recently - I have a 4-year-old. And I run a basketball tournament in New York. And I had my son there for - on the mic. And it was beautiful. It was like, word, my son is here. He's experiencing this with me. But, you know, then he ran out in the middle of court, you know, in the middle of the game. I was like, whoa, like, somebody get him. BARTOS: (Laughter). GARCIA: And I'm imagining there must be some benefits and some downsides to traveling with your family or maybe no downsides. But... BADU: Yeah. GARCIA: ...I'm just wondering like.... BADU: Well, it's all I know. I mean, like, I - my first record came out in 1997 in February. I got pregnant with my first child in March of 1997. My second album came out in November of 1997 on the 18. And I had the baby on the same day as my second album released. All this in 1997. So I don't know music without breastfeeding and caring for and A&D Ointment and all that stuff. I mean, it's just part of it all. And I just kind of pace it all because it's all my responsibility, you know, at this point. I have three children now. They're all six years apart, six and seven years apart. Mars, Puma and Seven. Seven's now 20. He'll be 21 in November. That means \"Baduizm\" is also 21. I've been traveling eight months out of the year for 21 years. Never had a vacation. My vacation is when everybody leave my house. (LAUGHTER) BADU: That's my vacation. BARTOS: So what is it about touring that keeps you on the road every year? I mean, most acts... BADU: Look. BARTOS: ...You know, they've got a record out, and they support it by touring. GARCIA: Sure. BARTOS: You don't have to do that. BADU: I choose not to. I consider myself a performance artist more than a recording artist. The stage is where I feel most comfortable in expressing who I am, where I am. Discovering things about myself is more therapy than it is a job. And, you know, recording is like perfecting a moment where - performing live is just creating a moment. And I love the feeling of creating that thing that just disappears and evaporates into time. You have it on your phone or video. But, for me, it's over after the moment. And there's something really beautiful about being able to just let go of something after you create it. BARTOS: Yeah. So onstage, you are - you know, that's where you shine. We want to play a clip of \"Tyrone\" live from 1997. BADU: (Laughter). (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BADU: (Singing) I'm getting tired of your shit. You don't never buy me nothing. (CHEERING) BADU: (Singing) See, every time you come around, you got to bring Jim, James, Paul and Tyrone. (LAUGHTER) BARTOS: I mean, first line and all the women erupt. BADU: That's how you start the song right there. GARCIA: Right. That got to be the strongest opening line in soul history 'cause it's like, tired of your shit. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BADU: (Singing) Now, every time I ask you for a little cash, you say no but turn right around and ask me for some ass. (CHEERING) BARTOS: Wow. That's like the Erykah Badu church right there. GARCIA: (Laughter). BADU: Right. Church. It was all freestyled. I just made it all up as I went. GARCIA: Oh, word? BADU: Yeah. And they caught it on tape in D.C., and it was on the radio the next day and went viral. That's how it happened. There was no Internet or anything like that, so... GARCIA: I did not know that. BARTOS: Wow. BADU: Right. So they caught the live performance. After the live performance, I went in the studio and actually recorded it. And I didn't remember all of the things, so it's a little different on the recorded version, but it was all in a moment. You know, that's the beauty of live performance, you know. And... GARCIA: Sure. BADU: ...That's one of the amazing moments where it was caught on tape. BARTOS: I didn't know how ridiculously funny you were till I saw you live. And in between songs is as entertaining as the music. And I'm just curious, like, where does your humor come from? BADU: My family. It's our coping mechanism. You know, it's the way we get on with time and life, tragedy. You know, everything is funny to us. And I also feel like the world is a private joke between me and God. Everything is funny to me. I guess it's just, you know, one of the things that I am, one of the ways I express who I am. And I don't have the most popular opinion. So a lot of times, the humor can be misunderstood or took for something else. But I don't care. I mean, only thing I apologize for is that you don't understand what I'm saying. I love to laugh. I love to be tickled. It feels great - really, really good. (LAUGHTER) BADU: Inside, you know, the tickley (ph) feeling, it's just great. I love to feel like I have to hold my nose in class so the teacher won't see me laughing. You know, I like laughing that hard. And I like laughing to tears. I like laughing until my tummy hurts. I like laughing until I'm mad. Like, you know, when somebody is tickling you and you don't really want to laugh? I like laughing like that. I like spitting my water out, you know. BARTOS: How often does that happen? BADU: All the time. BARTOS: Oh, you're lucky. GARCIA: You ever go do stand-up comedy? You know, I'm reading that you used to work at Steve Harvey's comedy club. BADU: I did. GARCIA: You've been on tour with Dave Chappelle. Like, what's up? BADU: Oh, well, yeah, I would hope - I want to. GARCIA: You want to be a stand-up comic? BADU: I mean, Michael Blackson always says, OK, when you come to LA this time, you're going to go onstage, just do it. And just go do it and see, just go see, try. So we'll see. Let's see if that's my thing, one of my things - could be, could be not. BARTOS: All right. We're ready to be your first audience right now. BADU: Badum-tish (ph). GARCIA: Test it out. BADU: Mushroom walks into a bar. A mushroom walks into a bar. The bartender says, fuck out of here. (LAUGHTER) BADU: We don't serve mushroom in here. GARCIA: (Laughter). BADU: Mushroom says, why not? I'm a fun guy. Tssh (ph). (LAUGHTER) GARCIA: Badum-bum (ph). BADU: One more. One more. One more. GARCIA: OK. Go ahead. Go for it. Go for it. BADU: So there's a little boy and a little girl. They were - no, I already messed it up. (LAUGHTER) BADU: I don't know. I'll try it at some point. I'll try it. GARCIA: Who's the funniest cat you think out there - period, ever? BADU: My mother. GARCIA: Word? BADU: Yeah. My mother is funnier than anybody I know. She's a mixture between Richard Pryor, Redd Foxx, Martin Lawrence... GARCIA: Like, she got snaps or she got stories? BADU: ...Robin Harris. It's just the way she is, just her everyday walking around doing nothing, just walking. She walk funny. She talk funny. She... (LAUGHTER) BADU: She snap her head around at you when she look at you funny. She come back quick on your ass funny. She - you know, she's hilarious. GARCIA: So clearly, that's... BADU: Where I got my humor. GARCIA: You're, like, the 2.0 of your mom I guess. BADU: Yeah. I'm an improvement on her design. (LAUGHTER) BADU: Yes. We don't be telling no jokes. It's just - we just funny. GARCIA: Yeah. BADU: We just be saying shit that's funny. GARCIA: Right. BADU: And it just be funny. GARCIA: I was talking to my boy Skin in Dallas. He was in your group for a hot... BADU: Cannabinoids. GARCIA: Yeah - for a hot second. He's my dude. I known him for a minute. BADU: Yeah. GARCIA: And he was telling me your nickname back in the day was Apples. BADU: Yeah, it was. Apples. All the kids called me that from fifth grade till 12th grade. GARCIA: How did that come about? BADU: I don't know. I think Prince had this movie that came out, \"Purple Rain,\" and there was the lady Apollonia... GARCIA: Oh. BADU: And I was, like, a really fanatic - Prince fanatic, and that was my, like, short name for Apollonia - Apples. (LAUGHTER) GARCIA: Wow. Yeah, I... BADU: And my derriere, too - those who know that (unintelligible). (LAUGHTER) BARTOS: When did you finally meet Prince for the first time? BADU: First time I met Prince, he was my rhythm guitarist onstage at Paisley Park, where I performed live with him. He wanted to meet me and play, you know, with us onstage. He's an amazing human being, real honest. And he liked to laugh, too, so, I mean, we were just giggling and shit, laughing at people. And, you know, we kept in touch here and there over the years. But I remember my - I came up with the album called \"Worldwide Underground.\" (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"BACK IN THE DAY\") BADU: (Singing) Back in the day when things were cool. And he came one of my shows, and I got in the limo with him, and he said, now, look; that's not nothing. (LAUGHTER) BADU: I was like, what? He said, no, that ain't finished; that's not nothing; you need to come on with it now. That's - what you doing? What you doing? I was like, oh, well... (LAUGHTER) BADU: Oh, no, that's - it's just the process; this is, like, my - this is, like, a little demo. He said, it sure is. (LAUGHTER) BADU: I said, all right. I said, OK. GARCIA: All right. BADU: But he showed up at my birthday party one year, my 30th birthday in Dallas. I had a little theater at the time, and it was in South Dallas, so... GARCIA: The Black Forest Theater? BADU: The Black Forest Theater. GARCIA: Word. BADU: It was on the corner of Martin Luther King and 75, so you know where that is - Malcolm X Boulevard. And I can't believe Prince was in our neighborhood, you know? And he got to the theater, and his assistant set up his little area before he got there - you know, velveted it out and swept out, sprayed... (LAUGHTER) GARCIA: What you mean, sprayed? BADU: Sprayed some spray, you know? They got it together. BARTOS: Purple paint. (LAUGHTER) BADU: Purple (unintelligible). And he got the area all together, and he came to the show. And then he got onstage and performed till 4 a.m., like - and I was just honored. And he was genuine, and he genuinely liked me. And other than the talking about that music from the album \"Worldwide Underground,\" which he did not care for too much, we really didn't talk about music too much. GARCIA: Aw, that's... BADU: We just kind of talked about life. GARCIA: And you were pregnant at the time, correct? BADU: Not at that time, no. GARCIA: Oh, OK. BADU: I wasn't pregnant yet. GARCIA: Maybe... BARTOS: One of those rare moments you weren't pregnant. (LAUGHTER) BADU: I was pregnant one time when I went onstage with Prince when he did a show in an arena. I was pregnant that time. But that's why they called me Fat Belly Bella because they'd never know when I'm going to be impregnated - pregnant. (LAUGHTER) GARCIA: Well, I live in Crown Heights right now with my wife. And she has had the thought from time to time of studying to become a doula, and she had mentioned Queen Afua, who is a holistic health - sort of spiritual healer, adviser. And home - she lives right down the block from us. And that's - and my wife mentioned - she was like, yo, that's where Erykah studied to become a doula. I was like, what? BADU: Yeah. Actually, I didn't study to become a doula there. She's a holistic health practitioner, counselor, nutritionist, healer of all sorts. She's a seer. She's all kinds of things. I studied under her through becoming friends with her son, and she kind of became my godmother. And I went through a program with her called Sacred Woman, and your wife would really love it. It's kind of, like, where we get to comprise and create our own program of eating, praying, living, respecting ourselves and our bodies, and creating boundaries for ourselves. It's that kind of thing, and all young women would really benefit from it because it's a very structured, beautiful program, and it kind of helps you to awaken to your true beauty and how it connects with the all and everything. And that's what I learned from Queen Afua, among many, many other things. I became a doula a little later. BARTOS: And how does one go about getting Erykah Badu to be their doula. GARCIA: (Laughter). BADU: I do it free of charge. I don't charge anything for any of my healing techniques. I connect with people. Some are relatives. Some are people who I've met in the industry. There's a model named Slick Woods who I'm assisting - you know, when I have time. I can only take two mothers per year. You know, there's nine months in the process, so I wish I could do more. It's just random how it happens. There's no system to it. BARTOS: You know, I don't know how public you are with your spirituality, but just curious, I mean, if there's some way of you defining what spirituality is for you, how would you do that? BADU: I've read a lot of things because when I got here and there were all these - you know, when I say got here, I mean when I was born. There were already all these theories already in place for me to just pick one, and they're all so nice, so it's difficult to pick just one. But in traveling around the world, everybody is in need of the same thing. Everybody wants to be loved. Everybody wants to work with pride. I don't know anything for sure, but I do know that being kind to others is the most important thing that I can do and being and doing that helps. And how I get to that place is through listening for the stillness underneath everything. Stillness is the closest thing to what love is or what God is. GARCIA: You mention the concept of stillness, but you also, you know, evoke the mindset of being woke. You're an empath, and so you're absorbing a lot of energy - positive, as well as negative... BADU: Yeah. GARCIA: ...On a constant basis. So how does one maintain still and how does one maintain being woke in a parallel universe? BADU: In the cognitive dissonance of things. Cognitive dissonance is just kind of, like, you got one foot over on meditation and doing the right thing all the time, and the other foot is in the world of reacting to everything that's going on around you - you know, accepting that someone says something negative about you and being able to feel - you know, on your timeline, if somebody says some negative, you can kind of say, OK, something wrong with them; nothing wrong with me. And you can kind of rationalize that kind of stuff. So I kind of try to live between the rational and emotional - right in between - not too far left, not too far right, not too far woke, not too far sleep. (LAUGHTER) BADU: ...Right in between, so it... (LAUGHTER) BADU: That makes me the observer. You know, when you're right in between, you kind of can zoom out, and you can observe yourself and the situations that you're in. BARTOS: Erykah... BADU: Yeah. BARTOS: I've never asked anyone this question before. BADU: Uh-oh. BARTOS: But have you ever had an out-of-body experience? BADU: (Laughter) I have. I've had an out-of-body experience. I mainly have them right after the REM sleep, when you're trying to wake up and you really can't wake up. And I hear this buzzing in my head, and then my eyes are slightly open - y'all know what I'm talking about? - the - that moment. GARCIA: Happens to me every night. (LAUGHTER) BADU: Not that kind of buzzing. (LAUGHTER) BADU: But, like, there's a - there's that moment. And I used to have it all the time when I was a child, and I would be horrified. I'd be terrified, and I would just start praying to everything. I didn't even believe in all of the stuff - Jesus, Buddha, everybody, somebody. (LAUGHTER) GARCIA: Everybody. BADU: ...Just in case. GARCIA: Help me. BADU: You know? But one night I decided not to fight it, and I woke up on the other side. I could see my own body. I floated away from it, and I was - you know, it was my house, and I was looking around the house. I went outside, and the grass was really green and tall, and it was nighttime. And then I floated back inside, and I sat in a chair. I wasn't really sitting down. I kind of was by a chair or hovering over a chair. And then I couldn't wake up. And it came to me, oh, I don't have a body. So I had to float back into the room. And it was terrifying to see my own body laying there. So I turned backwards and floated backwards back into my body, and I woke up. BARTOS: Wow. GARCIA: Wow. Do your children have the same ability? BADU: My middle daughter has told me that she's experienced the can't wake up and trying really hard - the paralysis, the sleep paralysis. She's mentioned that, but she hadn't went any further than that. She's 14. GARCIA: Yeah. BADU: So I don't interfere or try to explain what it is. I want them to discover, you know, all these things for themselves. GARCIA: What do you draw from your children that's informing you in a way that's most helpful to what you're trying to accomplish as an artist and beyond? BADU: Oh, my God, so much. We talk about this all the time. When I see my son or daughter do something a bit more evolved than my thinking, I'm just so amazed and pleased. And people around me remind me, oh, that's you; you're like that. And I'm - and I don't. I'm not aware that I am evolved in my thinking in those kind of ways. Like, for example, my son has a look on his face all the time. It's not quite a smile, and it's not quite a smirk, but the look says, I hope that's working out for you. And he just wants - he wants everybody to feel good. He wants everybody to kind of - he wants things to work out. He's not judgmental very much, you know? He gives things a chance. I'm impressed by that. It feels good because it means that we've done something right or we - because children learn from not what you say, but who you are and what you do. And that means that his father and I have expressed something right or he's extracted the best things from the both of us. That's what it looks like to me. BARTOS: Nice. BADU: And my daughter, who's 14 - I remember she was in a situation - Puma is forgetful sometimes, and she's an artist. She's a true artist, so she's forgetful. And she was in a group at one point. They were doing a project, and one of the students told her, look; you're going to have to, you know, focus and get on point because we don't want to make a bad grade because you're in our group. And it really hurt Puma because she's not doing it, you know, to hurt anyone. It's just the way her mind is. GARCIA: Yeah. BADU: And she came home, and she told me, and I was very upset. And I said, well, she's not a good leader, is she? And Puma said, no, she's an amazing leader; she just wasn't a good leader today. And I was like, oh, OK. (LAUGHTER) BADU: She's able to see that even through being hurt from a person. GARCIA: Yeah. BADU: You know, and they are incredible people. Yeah. One more thing - my youngest, Mars, who I - is my favorite. I'm not supposed to say that. (LAUGHTER) BADU: But the other kids know. She gets more on her plate. She gets - all she's got to do is wake up and play and sing and eat. Leave her alone. Don't say nothing to her. Give her her peace. Give it to her. Yeah. Mars is - she's funny. Mars is the Richard Pryor. She's the only one out of all of them that cuss - cusses. BARTOS: Wait, how old is she? BADU: ...Because the other ones have - she's 9. The other ones have... (LAUGHTER) BADU: The other ones have heard curse words and everything, but they know this is an adult thing. Mars doesn't care. She's Jay Electronica's child. BARTOS: OK. BADU: So she's a very, very critical thinker. And she was about 4, and I told her - you know, we were bathing her, and she was like, well, what do you call it? What's the name of it? And I said, vagina; it's called vagina. And she said, vagina, OK. And I said, yes, vagina, and it's the most important thing on the planet. (LAUGHTER) BADU: Mars said, hmm, where is the planet's vagina? I said, Dallas. (LAUGHTER) BADU: Me and Mars are a good team. She's really smart, and she's funny and - but I learn a lot from all of them. You know... GARCIA: Nice. BADU: They are awesome reflections. BARTOS: So Erykah, there was a recent controversy over some things you said in a Vulture article about some controversial figures like Farrakhan and Bill Cosby and Adolf Hitler. Perhaps some of your words were taken out of context, but I'm wondering, in the wake of that, has that made you a more cautious person? BADU: So a little bit more cautious. What it does is it made me realize that doing print interviews in 2018 doesn't really help me at all or anyone because they're going to - you know, if they want to create clickbait, they're going to take a section of it and put it into another section and make it be what it - they want it to be. And I wasn't cautious during the interview at all because I was very clear, and within the context, I was only expressing compassion, and we were talking about compassion. And I used - maybe, now I know - the worst example I could use for compassion. But I was very clear, and it was very - it was a beautiful conversation that we had but turned into something pretty bad because of, I guess, what some publications wanted to do, you know, what the media wanted to do or how they wanted to spin it. BARTOS: Did you ever have a chance to speak to the person that conducted the interview, the journalist in the wake of that? BADU: Yeah, the journalist was amazing. It wasn't the journalist that twisted the conversation. It was someone taking a quote from the conversation and making that the conversation. BARTOS: Right. Welcome to 2018. BADU: Thank you. (LAUGHTER) BADU: I've - haven't gotten their official welcome. Thank you. I didn't really know where we were. GARCIA: I mean, words have been getting twisted out of context. BADU: It's all right. It's OK. GARCIA: That's prior to the Internet age. BADU: But mine are always... (LAUGHTER) BADU: They're twisted because, like I said, I don't have the most popular opinion. So I think, as human beings, we want someone to pick a side. We want you to pick this side or that side because if you're speaking positively about this side, it means that you're not on their side. So they want you to pick a side. There has to be a villain, you know? And because I don't do that, because I'm observing everything and trying to be a voice just for the whole, it's confusing, you know, to some people. And to some people, it's not confusing. They just want to misunderstand, you know? GARCIA: Word. BARTOS: Yep. BADU: And it's all right. GARCIA: I realize that, you know, it's been some time since your last studio-recorded album, but since you're so prolific on the road, doing different things, improv-ing (ph) and having guest appearances onstage - like, why not a studio - I mean, another concert album? Is that on the horizon? BADU: That's a great idea. I'm going to do that. GARCIA: Thank you. Ten percent - 10 percent, homegirl. BADU: I got you. Not 10, but we can do something. (LAUGHTER) BARTOS: You get a shoutout. BADU: You get a shoutout. BARTOS: And nonexistent liner notes. BADU: I mean, I put you on - I'll put your ad on my tweets. (LAUGHTER) BADU: I'll follow y'all - start following you. GARCIA: Word. All right. Cool. I appreciate that. But in terms of the recorded space, what potentially is on the horizon from Erykah Badu on - in terms of singing, because we know you've got 80,000 projects outside of that. BADU: Yeah. You know what? It's - as an artist, things have to happen organically for me. And if I'm not really feeling or I don't have anything to say, I can't really write anything. It's - there's no writing team. So how I'm expressing myself artistically right now is through visuals. I haven't been needing words to express how I feel. For the past few years, I've been using the frequency of the eyes. You know. So I've been making these little visuals on Instagram. It kind of expresses where I am in colors and in tones and movement. I don't know why it's that way, but I guess, musically, I'm just uploading right now. GARCIA: Erykah, we've been talking a lot. I think, let's take a little break and we can vibe. We'll be back with the Impression Session. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) BARTOS: You know what that means. GARCIA: What does that mean, Stretch? BARTOS: That means it's time for the Impression Session. GARCIA: Word. Here's how it works. We play a track, Erykah... BADU: OK. GARCIA: And you react. Simple as that. BADU: OK. GARCIA: Cool? BADU: OK. GARCIA: Actually, you were part of our Impression Session when you dropped in on Dave Chappelle. BADU: OK. GARCIA: Yeah. And you kind of, like, played me when I played my record, but it's OK. (LAUGHTER) BADU: I'm sorry. GARCIA: It's all good. We have a - I feel like our vibrations are more in sync cognitively today than the Dave Chappelle phone-in. But Stretch, why don't you play - you're going to go first? BARTOS: Yeah. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"WHAT'S WRONG WITH MBULU: (Singing) What is wrong with groovin'? Can't a gal just have a little happy without any hide-and-seek? What is it you're asking for? Surely there must be another way out. They don't have to put me down. Why do they follow me around just like their name was 007? BADU: Is that Angela Bofill? BARTOS: That's actually Letta Mbulu. She's a South African singer from Soweto. And yeah, she was an exile in New York City. She left South Africa in 1965. And in New York, she did a bunch of music of Hugh Masekela, Miriam Makeba. She ended up doing a... GARCIA: Who were also exiled from South Africa at the time, too. BARTOS: That's right. Excuse me. And she actually ended up singing on \"Liberian Girl\" by Michael Jackson. It was a... BADU: Did she sing on \"Soul To Soul\" - a song? BARTOS: I don't think so. BADU: That voice is powerful. BARTOS: But anyway, I'm talking too much. This is about your reaction to the music. BADU: Oh, my reaction to that is I feel - I felt like I was in a yellow - a room with a yellow ceiling, with yellow floral wallpaper, a hardwood brown floor, sitting in a chair, looking out a window at time go by. GARCIA: And you visited Soweto recently - right? BADU: Yeah. GARCIA: ...To record. BADU: Yeah. It was a few years ago, maybe three years ago. I did record there - drums. I went in search of drums. I was on my Ginger Baker... (LAUGHTER) BADU: ...Movement. You know, I went all over the world to find - in search of drums, and I recorded many drums with different tribes and different people there in Soweto and in Joburg and Nigeria and in Kenya. So - but, yeah, it was definitely in Soweto. It was a great feeling. I brought my little drum trap set, and I played with the brothers there. GARCIA: I'm going to play you a song, all right? BADU: OK. GARCIA: Take a deep breath first. All right. Let's go. (SOUNDBITE OF NITIN SAWHNEY SONG, \"HOMELANDS\") BADU: Oh, that's lovely. GARCIA: It's a John Cage record. Pure silence. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"HOMELANDS\") NITIN SAWHNEY: (Singing in foreign language). BADU: Shit. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"HOMELANDS\") SAWHNEY: (Singing in foreign language). GARCIA: So Erykah, that's an artist by the name of Nitin Sawhney. He's from the U.K. but originally from India. BADU: Yeah. GARCIA: The title was \"Homelands.\" Reaction? BADU: Oh, feels like evolution. It feels like the process of learning. The beginning of the song, I was in a place, and I was very comfortable. And then it got - it went another direction. Then I was trying to learn that area. And I kind of - I felt it, and I got it. Then it went to another direction. It's kind of like - it put me in the mood of how we learn and grow, how we get comfortable in - on a place and have to evolve out of it, and it's a little uncomfortable, a little bit. GARCIA: That's so spot on because it's - I mean, he's talking about homelands and - because he's Indian but not living in India. And you actually without even understanding what the lyrics are about or the purpose of the song - that's exactly why he - that's what he tried to evoke as an artist. The reason why I played it for you is because Stretch and I recently - we DJed in Mumbai. BADU: Yeah. GARCIA: And I'm a vinyl-only cat and was trying to figure out, what's the first record I want to play in this set for my first time spinning with my dude? BADU: Yeah. GARCIA: I have seen that you spin - I saw a little clip of you spinning Michael - Jackson 5 \"ABC\" at one party, and everybody was, you know, throwing their hands in the air. But what I was curious about - because you're such a - you're an aficionado of music, what chances and what risks have you taken as a DJ where you just didn't know how the crowd was going to react, but you just went there regardless? You know, because, obviously, you do that as a performing artist. BADU: Yeah. GARCIA: And I'm imagining that there's a consistency with that as you as a DJ. BADU: I take a risk every night because I don't prepare crates. I don't prepare anything. I just don't know what's going to happen next. It's almost the same as I am onstage. We know all the songs, but we don't know how we're going to do it and how it's going to happen. It's kind of like - it's the - the risk is the reason why I do it - you know? - to just be in a place and not be afraid to do something different and new. It's like playing - like, especially when you get hired to rock a club, it's going to be difficult to deviate from what the people want to hear. They want to hear constant vibration, you know, nonstop. So when I do mix in things that are obscure, I have to do them in a way that does not break the trance. You know, there has to be that constant trance. And I have to do it in a way where it does not break the trance. GARCIA: Erykah, you've been... BARTOS: All right.
