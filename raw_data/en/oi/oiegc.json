Sincerely, Elizabeth Hordge-Freeman, Ph.D. Interim Vice President for Institutional Equity Senior Advisor to the President and Provost for Diversity and Inclusion USF RESEARCH SYMPOSIUM 2022 | 5March 24, 2022 Welcome to the USF Florida Alliance for Graduate Education and the Professoriate (FL-AGEP), Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Office, Office of Research and Innovation, and the Graduate Student Research Symposium hosted at the University of South Florida. This event cele - brates the importance of research in the training of our graduate students. Recognizing the necessity of diversity in the pursuit of scientific knowledge, the USF FL-AGEP program leads the way in supporting female scholars of color, particularly in the disciplines of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM). The Office of Graduate Studies welcomes the opportunity to pair with these offices for our annual celebration of graduate student research. During this event, you will be able to learn about the many research endeavors currently being conducted at the University of South Florida. We have chosen to sponsor two different formats in which our students will present their research. The first competition will take place virtually on Thursday, March 24, 2022. The virtual competition features the highest rated abstract submissions in each of five (5) research categories. These students will pres - ent their poster orally to a group of faculty judges via Teams. The top two posters in each group will move on to the Statewide Graduate Student Research Symposium next month. On Friday, March 25, all research participants are asked to present their posters in a competi - tion to be held in the Marshall Center Ballroom. FL-AGEP Scholars will be presenting their work in the graduate student and post-doctoral scholar groups at both events. We hope that you will be able to attend. The support provided by USF FL-AGEP , DEI, and the Office of Research strengthens this event by providing opportunities for networking among students, post-doctoral scholars, and faculty, while highlighting the importance of FL-AGEP in supporting female scholars of color at USF . The USF Office of Graduate Studies enthusiastically supports the USF FL-AGEP , DEI, and the Office of Research and Innovation in their quest to enhance the success of women of color in their pursuit of a career in the professoriate.

Despite the challenges of the global pandem - ic, the accomplishments of FL-AGEP scholars have been extraordinary and we are proud to celebrate your work. In light of our nation's pressing urgency to foster the full participation of individuals from underserved communities within academia and the STEM workforce, now more than ever we need to prepare minority scientists and engineers to help drive innovation and improve societal well-being for the country as a whole. As such, this National Science Foundation and USF sponsored event provides an opportune time to nurture and mentor historically underrepresented females in STEM at three critical stages - dissertation, postdoctoral, and early career faculty. We strongly support FL-AGEP's vision of providing faculty STEM role models and empowering women of color in academia. Over the past seven years, the USF College of Engineering has added 16 new Black/Latinx faculty (including 5 females) and promoted 3 Black/Latinx women of color to full professor. Moreover, USF has been a national leader in URM graduate student success as one of eight universities, the only Florida institution, able to provide enhanced financial and mentoring support from the Alfred P . Sloan Foundation for Black and Latinx PhD students in engineering, computer science, the physical sciences, and the geosciences. Toward these efforts, the College of Engineering is deeply invested in diversifying its faculty within all seven academic departments. We invite you to visit our website (https://www. usf.edu/engineering/), engage with our representatives, and explore postdoctoral/ faculty opportunities. Wishing everyone success during the symposium and in all future endeavors!
