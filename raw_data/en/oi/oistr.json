Administration IV: Administer over 35 minutes. Oral: Administer with feeds to minimise gastric irritation. Monitoring Blood glucose levels (BGLs) at least daily. When on oral feeds measure BGL only if there is glucose in urine. Blood pre ssure at least daily. Electrolytes. Contraindi cations Untreated s ystemic infections. Precautions Use preservative free drug where possible. Avoid early (<8 days) treatment, higher dose and longer courses where possible to redu ce side effects. Dexamethasone 2017 Neonatal Medicines Formulary Consensus Group Dexamethasone Page 2 of 4 This is a printed copy refer to the electronic system for most up to date version Avoid concurrent use with NSAIDs for PDA treatment. Corticosteroids may increase susceptibility to or mask the symptoms of infection. Drug Interactions Barbiturates, phenytoin and rifampicin may increase the metabolism of dexamethasone. Antithyroid agents may decrease the metabolism of dexamethasone. Adverse Reactions Early (< 8 days) postnatal corticosteroids cause short -term adverse effects perforation, hyperglycaemia, hyperten sion, hypertrophic failure. Late (after seven days) postnatal corticosteroids in high doses in particular are associated with short -term side effects including gastrointestinal bleeding, higher blood pressure, glucose intolerance , severe retinopathy of prematurity and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Other effects Hypertriglyceridemia in association with hyperinsulinism and raised free fatty acids. Increase in total and immature neutrophil counts; increase in platelet count . Adrenal insufficiency is with higher doses longer courses (>14 days) of dexamethasone. Myocardial hypertrophy and outflow obstruction may occur with higher doses and prolonged courses of dexamethasone. May increase r isk of infection.

Oral: Store in the fridge 28\u00b0C. Special Comments Evidence summary Efficacy: Late (after seven days) postnatal corti costeroids for chronic lung disease in preterm infants: corticosteroids to infants at least seven days old reduces the need for assisted ventilation and chronic lung disease, and may reduce death in the first 28 days of life. However, high doses in particu lar are associated with short -term side effects such as bleeding from the stomach or bowel, higher blood pressure, glucose intolerance, severe retinopathy of prematurity and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy [1]. (LOE t rials of postnatal corticosteroids in infants found a relationship between risk of bronchopulmonary dysplasia and risk of death or CP. With risks for CLD below 35%, corticosteroid treatment significantly increased the chance of death or CP, whereas with risks for CLD exceeding 65%, it reduced this chance. There was no difference overall in risk of death or cerebral palsy. The analysis suggests postnatal corticosteroids should be restricted to ventilated infants predicted to have 35% risk of bronchopulmonary dysplasia [2, 3] . (LOE III, GOR C) Conclusion: It is recommended reserve the use of late co rticosteroids for infants who cannot be weaned from mechanical ventilation and to minimise the dose and duration of any course of treatment [1]. Dose: Treatment regimens varied from cumulative dexamethasone doses 0.4 mg/kg up to 8.0 mg/kg [2]. The low dos e dexamethasone protocol (DART trial) facilitated extubation and shortened Dexamethasone 2017 Neonatal Medicines Formulary Consensus Group Dexamethasone Page 3 of 4 This is a printed copy refer to the electronic system for most up to date version duration of intubation in ventilator -dependent, very preterm/extremely low birth weight infants, without obvious short -term complications. [Twice -daily doses of a 10 -day tapering co urse of dexamethasone sodium phosphate (0.15 mg/kg per day for 3 days, 0.10 mg/kg per day for 3 days, 0.05 mg/kg per day for 2 days, and 0.02 mg/kg per day for 2 days; total of 0.89 mg/kg)] [4]. Early (< 8 days) onic lung disease in preterm infants: early corticosteroid treatment facilitates extubation and reduces the risk of chronic lung disease, patent ductus arteriosus and severe retinopathy of prematurity. However, it causes short -term adverse effects includin g gastrointestinal bleeding, intestinal perforation, hyperglycaemia, hypertension, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and growth failure. Long -term follow -up studies report an increased risk of abnormal neurological examination and cerebral palsy. There was no di fference in infection. The benefits of early postnatal corticosteroid treatment, particularly dexamethasone, may not outweigh the adverse effects of this treatment [5]. (LOE I, GOR B) Intravenous dexamethasone for extubation of newborn infants: Dexamethaso ne reduces the need for endotracheal reintubation of neonates after a period of intermittent positive pressure ventilation. In view of the lack of effect in low risk infants and the documented and potential side effects, restrict use to infants at increase d risk for airway oedema and obstruction, such as those who have received repeated or prolonged intubations. Dose regimens used 0.25 -0.5 mg/kg from 1 -3 [6]. [LOE I, Other side effects: Adrenal suppression and myocardial hypertrophy: Higher do ses (starting >0.2mg/kg) and prolonged courses (>14 days) may be associated with myocardial hypertrophy and adrenal suppression [7, 8] . (LOE II, GOR B) Infection: Systematic reviews of trials of early and late postnatal corticosteroids found no difference in infection rate overall [1, 4] . However, a crossover trial of dexamethasone -placebo versus placebo -dexamethasone reported increased nosocomial infection in the initial time period in the dexamethasone group [9]. Neutrophils: Dexamethasone increased tota l and immature peaking on day 7 [10].
