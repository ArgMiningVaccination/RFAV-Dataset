The [Curious Cures in Cambridge Libraries](https://www.cam.ac.uk/stories/curious-medieval-medicine) project will see more than 180 medieval manuscripts \u2014 which together contain over 8,000 unedited medical recipes \u2014 digitized, preserved and made available to read for anyone with an internet connection. Freeman hopes they will help historians and researchers understand how science and medicine were practiced at the time, and allow scholars to trace the provenance of recipes and practices. The manuscripts, which mostly date from the 14th and 15th centuries, show how people tried to treat common afflictions like toothaches and headaches, as well as flesh wounds, infertility, period pain \u2014 likely what was meant by the term grinding in the womb, says Freeman \u2014 and more. And among some of the cures were some recipes involving animals. \"As I started reading through some of these recipe books, you can imagine my jaw dropping and my eyes getting wider and wider as I read them,\" said Freeman. Baked owls and roasted puppies Gout was a recurring problem in England in the 14th and 15th centuries, according to Freeman, but the cures offered were very different from how we'd treat the condition today. \"There's a recipe ... for the treatment of gout that involves plucking and gutting an owl 'as if you were going to eat him,'\" he said. \"You salt the body and then you place it in an earthenware pot, put a tile \u2014 like a lid \u2014 over the top, and then you put it in the oven when you're putting dough in to make bread.\" When the bread is done, the pot with the owl is then taken out of the oven. \"You grind up the desiccated body of this poor old owl, mix it with boar's grease, and then you sit by the fire,\" he said. \"The part of your body that's affected by gout, you rub this salve into your foot or your leg.\" The owl salve is hardly the strangest cure for gout that Freeman came across. Another gruesome treatment called for a puppy. \"You take a puppy and you stuff his body with snails and sage and you roast him over the fire, and you essentially use the rendered fat to make a salve again,\" said Freeman. \"And if you don't have a puppy to hand, you can also use a male cat.\" The recipe doesn't explain why the cat must be male, he said. Recipes show people concerned with health Although the recipes calling for animals are eye-catching, the majority are herbal cures. \"Lots of herbs that we know today and still use in cooking: sage, rosemary, thyme, all of those sorts of things,\" said Freeman. Many of the manuscripts are written in Latin or Middle English, and some are in French. They include rhymes, prose, illustrations and vary in size. The oldest of the bunch is 1,000 years old. Freeman hopes making the manuscripts available will provide researchers the opportunity to study the recipes and determine their origins, and to change how people viewed medieval medicine and science. \"I think it's fair to say that the adjective medieval tends not to be used in a complimentary way nowadays, particularly if it's attached to something we now think of, like medicine, as very scientific and rigorous,\" he said. \"But clearly, people were aware of their own health and [that] of other people, wanted to live well and be healthy. So they don't conform to the, you know, the popular stereotype of the peasant covered in mud and filthy and their teeth all falling out.\" Freeman notes that the manuscripts show evidence people tested and experimented with the cures, which he can see through annotations that affirm if a recipe is proven or warn others away from using it. He says some manuscripts had entire pages crossed out. \"I don't want to say it's the beginning of the scientific method, I think it's too early for that. But clearly there's some sorts of observed work going on,\" he said. \"People are trying these things, substituting ingredients, experimenting, if you will, and seeing what works and what doesn't.
