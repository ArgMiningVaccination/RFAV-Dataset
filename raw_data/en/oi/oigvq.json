As a member of Hussain's lab, Ali has been investigating the renoprotective roles of the AT2 receptor and its correlation with immune cell infiltration in kidney diseases. Most recently, Ali has shown that AT2R activation reduces the kidney infiltrating immune cells, thereby limiting post-IR kidney injury, and enhancing the tissue repair. Until 2018, Ali served as a postdoctoral fellow and research associate at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York. Ali completed his Ph.D. degree in biochemistry/immunology at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences in New Delhi.
