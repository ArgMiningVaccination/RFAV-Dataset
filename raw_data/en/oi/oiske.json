Aesthetic Homeopathic Mesotherapy is a natural cosmetic treatment, which helps rejuvenate the skin in many parts of the body, including the face, neck and legs. It is a complementary health technique pioneered by the Italian physician Dr. Massimo de Bellis and used on the continent for some years. The treatment involves the use of fine injections, and works by combining the effectiveness of acupuncture and homeopathy. Homeopathic Mesotherapy, also known as Biopuncture, is now an established complementary treatment for many medical conditions. Aesthetic Homeo-Mesotherapy is the application of the same principles to achieve cosmetic benefits. How does the treatment work? Tiny amounts of homeopathic remedies are injected into the skin to stimulate the body's own production of collagen, enabling the collagen to work more effectively. This leads to an improvement in skin tone and elasticity, revitalizing tissues and allowing the skin to become more hydrated. Unlike other cosmetic treatments such as Botox, Aesthetic Homeo-Mesotherapy is completely natural. It can be particularly effective when combined with lifestyle advice to aid the detoxification of the body. The technique is suitable for use on the face and many other parts of the body where it can reduce adiposity (fat deposits) and cellulite. What products are injected? These are predominantly plant-based homeopathic preparations that have been safely used for years by complementary health therapists. We usually use Guna Made mixed with Guna Collagen. BENEFITS OF HOMEOPATHIC MESOTHERAPY: - No side effects; - A possibility to have treatment during pregnancy; - A complete compatibility of the applicable medications, resulting in correction of several problems simultaneously; - A possibility to mix 4 medications without a risk of complications. In our opinion, the most important that makes a positive distinguish between homeo-mesotherapy and allopathic mesotherapy is a possibility of a systemic influence on the body by means of ultra-low doses of medications to correct immunity and provide a drainage effect on organs and systems! Dr. Soto is able to help everybody who desires to improve his or her outer appearance by using natural homeopathic means and methods that boost immune system, improve natural reactions and hormonal balance. What parts of the body can be treated? - Facial wrinkles - Forehead, cheeks and chin - Neck - Lower neck and d\u00e9colletage Treatment FAQs Patients generally notice an improvement in their skin tone within days of their first treatment. The effect will last for as long as you continue to have regular follow up sessions after the main course of injections ends. Activities such as sun tanning promote collagen destruction (catabolism) and skin-aging. In this case it is recommended to take a cycle of MADE\u00ae treatment. The Guna Method The best thing about the Guna method is that it actually makes the skin healthier. It naturally stimulates the cells and skin matrix to repair as part of an overall physiological healing. Each and every product contains ingredients that address the PNEI - psycho-neuro-endocrine-immune axis. By treating all of these levels, the body can fully accept, integrate, and act on the medicinal message. To me this takes the holistic philosophy of nature and traditional herbal medicine and combines it with a cutting edge delivery system. The results are cosmetic as well as internal. GUNA's innovative natural medications have a variety of benefits: - Active ingredients, promoting fast immune response, assuring no side effects or contraindications and not provoking allergenic reactions; - The treatment action is focused on the main aesthetic problems such as: wrinkles, cellulite, adiposity, muscle tone and ageing; - Ease of administration according to mesotherapeutic techniques and neurological points that assure best local activity.

The participants were applied linear infiltration on the area of wrinkles by means of mesotherapeutic technique. The treatment course consisted of 8 sessions, one session a week. For some patients the treatment was continued as follows: 1 session a month for 2-3 months. The results were evaluated before and after the program by means of subjective classification of the visual and tactile characteristics of the wrinkles and the slackening of the face and neck tissues. A mild reaction to the treatment was observed in 20 cases (3{1efd15bfd88256461d107bda7fd0826a71a6cbefab4cde58d5a01a85daee0a13}) with slight erythema in the injection site.
