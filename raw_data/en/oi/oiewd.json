Water Filtration System: [Radiant Life Water System.](https://www.radiantlifecatalog.com?aff=PureWater) I have the Whole House Water Conditioning and Filtration System as well as the Kitchen 14 step System. The Whole House System immediately took out the chlorine that was overwhelming our water supply. I can take baths now, not feeling like I'm swimming in a pool. I love the kitchen filtration system as well. It removes all the toxins and replaces the minerals in the water so no having to add extra mineral drops, etc. Use Code: LOVEWATER to get 10% off your purchase Sauna: I love the Relax Brand Sauna because: - Hottest sauna in America - Very minimal EMF exposure - Double ceramic heaters to heat you instantly - Impregnated with silver for antibacterial function - Treatment time is 20-30 min. max due to how fast it heats the core - Powerful detoxification system - Gets hotter than the wooden saunas and you can stick your head (and arms) out to prevent heat discomfort (and I like watching a movie or listening to a podcast as I sweat) The Amazon saunas come from China and have 1 heater, they are made from cheap materials, give off higher amounts of EMF, take a long time to heat up and decrease the ability to truly get to the core for a large cellular detox. Wooden saunas (if they don't use chemically treated wood) are nice, but they too can take a long time to heat and don't get as hot.
