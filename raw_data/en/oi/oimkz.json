In a letter to all the Provincial Regulatory Colleges regarding their endorsement and promotion of vaccination as \"safe and effective\" the CCA stated that the reason for the change is that the chiropractic profession needs to be \"considered a trusted and respected healthcare profession within Canada's healthcare system\". And the way to do that was to give in to Canada's Chief Public Health Officer Theresa Tam and her request to have the chiropractic profession endorse their mass vaccination agenda. According to the CCA letter, Tam had contacted the CCA's CEO Alison Dantas with a \"grave concern\" regarding vaccine hesitancy and sought the support of the chiropractic profession in ending its skepticism regarding mandatory vaccination of the population. The CCA referred to their efforts to claim that vaccinations are \"safe and effective\" as \"a pivotal moment that will bolster our credibility\". It appears the CCA was duped since vaccines are not universally safe and effective and even a cursory review of the scientific literature will demonstrate that. Nevertheless, the CCA acquiesced and swallowed the ruse hook, line and sinker. More bizarre than the CCA's endorsement of such controversial practices is the admission that \"vaccination is not within the scope of chiropractic practice in Canada\". The CCA (made up of chiropractors that are subject to the law) ignores this and goes ahead and violates that law and issues advice on the practice of vaccination and tells all their members to do the same. The CCA is playing catch up on the vaccine controversy since the College of Chiropractors of Ontario (CCO) had already fully endorsed vaccinations declaring them \"Safe & Effective\" earlier in 2019 and the Ontario Chiropractors Association (OCA) then told their members to proclaim publicly: \"I recognize that vaccinations provide a safe and effective means to protect individuals from infectious disease.\" The OCA further encouraged the chiropractors to use the hashtags: #VaccinesWork & #Chiros4VaccinesWork [CLICK HERE to see related story](http://chiropractic.prosepoint.net/163417) Apparently the OCA realized they had just told their entire membership to violate the law and a follow up statement was issued shortly after by the OCA to recant their previous statement: \"However, the CCO standard on vaccination and immunization, as written today, precludes any comment by members on this issue. CCO reminds members and the public that treating or advising in relation to vaccination is outside of the chiropractic scope of practice. As a result, we ask you to disregard our earlier request for you to make any statement on any social platforms and adhere to the existing CCO standard.\" This whole situation is problematic as the Canadian trade associations and regulatory boards struggle to issue a position statement that is not contradictory while being charged with the task of regulating chiropractors. Telling chiropractors to advise on the merits of vaccination would be outside of the scope of those chiropractors and since the associations and regulatory bodies are made up of chiropractors - how are they allowed to issue any vaccination advice? This should raise questions on the ability of the Provincial Colleges to regulate chiropractors if they cannot regulate themselves. And of course there is no mention of the role and rights of citizens regarding personal autonomy, consent or exemptions by these Canadian chiropractic organizations and boards and it seems clear that chiropractors would be ill advised to discuss consent or autonomy with their patients. It seems pretty clear that while Canadian chiropractors are not legally allowed to discuss vaccination - they must endorse it and they must not discuss any controversy with their patients. This is consistent with the dissolution of free speech and the adoption of compelled speech by the government in Canada and the adoption of these policies by Canadian chiropractors. We saw the adoption of similar Orwellian policies in regards to the chiropractic care of children by these Canadian provinces and more should be expected. The decision by the CCA should come as no surprise by anyone who has been following the events within chiropractic which have led to restrictive, anti-subluxation, anti-vitalistic and unscientific policies that have spread from the United Kingdom, to Australia, Canada and the United States.

The following is the text of the new Policy Statement on Vaccination by the Canadian Chiropractic Association VACCINATION AND IMMUNIZATION Vaccination is not within the scope of chiropractic practice in Canada. Notwithstanding, the Canadian Chiropractic Association recognizes that vaccination is a safe and effective public health practice for the prevention of infectious diseases. Members are encouraged to refer all patient questions, consultation and education regarding immunization and vaccinations to the appropriate public health authorities and/or health professional whose scope of practice includes vaccination. The Canadian Chiropractic Association is a national association representing more than 9,000 of Canada's licensed Doctors of Chiropractic. As MSK experts, chiropractors provide the assessment, diagnosis, treatment and preventative care of biomechanical disorders originating from the muscular, skeletal and nervous systems. Approximately 4.5 million Canadians use the services of a chiropractor each year. The CCA advocates on behalf of members and their patients to advance the quality and accessibility of chiropractic care in Canada and to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the healthcare system.
