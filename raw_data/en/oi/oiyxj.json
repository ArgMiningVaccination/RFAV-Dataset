There are no data available on the interchangeability of COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 with other COVID -19 vaccines to complete the vaccination series. Individuals who have received one dose of COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 should receive a second dose o f COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 to complete the vaccination series. Individuals may not be maximally protected until at least 7 days after their second dose of the vaccine. 3 Ref:SPC BNT1 62 UK 1 2_0 For further information on efficacy , see section 5.1. Paediatric population The safety and efficacy of COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 in children under 1 2 years of age have not yet been established. Method of administration Administer the COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 intramuscularly of COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 contain six doses of 0.3 mL of vaccine. In order to extract six doses from a single vial, low dead-volume syringes and/or needles should be used. If standard syringes and needles are used, there may not be sufficient volume to extract a sixth dose from a single vial. Irrespective of the type of syringe and needle: Each dose must contain 0.3 mL of vaccine. If the amount of vaccine remaining in the vial cannot provide a full dose of 0.3 mL, discard the vial and any excess volume. Do not pool excess vaccine from multiple vials. Preparation: The multidose vial is stored frozen and must be thawed prior to dilution. Frozen vials should be transferred to 2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C to thaw . Alternatively, frozen vials may also be thawed and kept at temperatures up to 25\u00b0C for a maximum of two hours in preparation for dilution for use . When removed from the freezer, the undiluted vaccine has a maximum shelf life of up to 1 month (31 days) at 2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C and an additional 2 hours at temperatures up to 25\u00b0C in preparation for dilution . When the thawed vial is at room temperature gently invert 10 times prior to dilution. Do not shake . Prior to dilution, the thawed dispersion may contain white to off -white opaque amorphous particles. 4 Ref:SPC BNT1 62 UK 1 2_0 The thawed vaccine must be diluted in its original vial with 1.8 mL sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9% ) solution for injection, using a 21 gauge or narrower need le and aseptic techniques . Warning: Unpreserved s odium chloride solution for injection is the only diluent that should be used. This diluent is not provided in the vaccine carton. Equalise vial pressure before removing the needle from the vial by withdrawing 1.8 mL air into the empty diluent syringe. Gently invert the diluted solution 10 times . Do not shake. The diluted vaccine should present as an off - white solution with no particulates visible. Discard the diluted vaccine i f particulates or discolo uration are present. 5 Ref:SPC BNT1 62 UK 1 2_0 The diluted vials should be marked with the dilution date and time and stored between 2\u00b0C to 25\u00b0C. Use as soon as practically possible , and within 6 hours after dilution. After dilution, the vial contains 6 doses of 0.3 mL. Withdraw the required 0.3 mL dose of diluted vaccine using a sterile needle and syringe and administer. Low dead -volume syringes and/or needles should be used in order to extract 6 doses from a single vial. If standard syringes and needles are used, there may not be sufficient volume to extract a sixth dose from a single vial. Each dose must contain 0.3 mL of vaccine. If the amount of vaccine remaining in the vial cannot provide a full dose of 0.3 mL, discard the vial and any excess volume. Any unused vaccine should be discard ed 6 hours after dilution. The vaccine should not be shipped (transported) by motor vehicle after dilution away from the site of dilution. Any shipping (transportation) by motor vehicle after dilution of the vial is at the risk of the Health Care Professional. For instructions on disposal see section 6.6. 4.3 Contraindications Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use Hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis Events of anaphylaxis have been reported. Appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be readily available in case of an anaphylactic reaction following the administration of the vaccine. Close observation for at least 15 minutes is recomm ended following vaccination. A second dose of the vaccine should not be given to those who have experienced anaphylaxis to the first dose of the COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2. 6 Ref:SPC BNT1 62 UK 1 2_0 Myocarditis and pericarditis There have been very rare reports of myocarditis and pericarditis occurring after vaccination with COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 often in younger men and shortly after the second dose of the vaccine. These are typically mild cases and individuals tend to recover within a short time following standard tr eatment and rest. Healthcare professionals should be alert to the signs and symptoms of myocarditis and pericarditis. Vaccinated individuals should also seek immediate medical attention should they experience new onset of chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations or arrhythmias. Traceability In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of the administered product should be clearly recorded. General recommendations The administration of COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 should be postponed in individuals suffering from acute severe febrile illness. The presence of a minor infection and/or low -grade fever should not delay vaccination. Anxiety -related reactions, includin g vasovagal reactions (syncope), hyperventilation or stressrelated reactions may occur in association with vaccination as a psychogenic response to the needle injection. It is important that precautions are in place to avoid injury from fainting. Individuals receiving anticoagulant therapy or those with a bleeding disorder that would contraindicate intramuscular injection, should not be given the vaccine unless the potential benefit clearly outweighs the risk of administration. Immunocompromised p ersons, including individuals receiving immunosuppressant therapy, may have a diminished immune response to the vaccine. No data are available about concomitant use of immunosuppressants. As with any vaccine, vaccination with COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b 2 may not protect all vaccine recipients. No data are available on the use of COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 in persons that have previously received a full or partial vaccine series with another C OVID -19 vaccine. Excipient information This vaccine conta ins potassium, less than 1 mmol (39 mg) per dose, i.e. essentially 'potassium -free'. This vaccine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. essentially 'sodiumfree'. 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction No interaction studies have been performed. Concomitant administration of COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 with other vaccines has not been studied (see section 5.1). Do not mix COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 with other vaccines/products in the same syringe. 4.6 Fertility, p regnancy and lactation Pregnancy There is limited experience with use of the COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 in pregnant women. Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryo/foetal development, parturition or post -natal development (see section 5.3). Administration of 7 Ref:SPC BNT1 62 UK 1 2_0 the COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 in pregnancy should only be considered when the potential benefits outweigh any potential ri sks for the mother and foetus. Breast -feeding It is unknown whether the COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 is excreted in human milk. Fertility Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity (see sec tion 5.3) 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. However, some of the adverse reactions mentioned under section 4.8 may temporarily affect the ability to drive or use machines. 4.8 Undesirable effects Summary of safety profile The safety of COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 was evaluated in participants 1 2 years of age and older in two clinical studies that included 22,875 participants (comprised of 21,744 participants 16 years of age and older and 1,131 adolescents 12 to 1 5 years of age) that have received at least one dose of COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 . Study BNT162 -01 (Study 1) enrolled 60 participants, 18 through 55 years of age. Study C4591001 (Study 2) enrolled approximately 44,000 participants, 12 years of age or older. Participants 16 years of age and older In Study 2, a total of 21,720 participants 16 years of age or older received at least one dose of COVID - 19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b and 21,728 participants 16 years of age or older received placebo. Out of these , at the time of the analysis , 19,067 (9531 COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 and 9536 placebo) were evaluated for safety 2 months after the second dose of COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2. Demographic characteristics were generally similar with regard to age, gender, race and ethnicity among participants who received COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine and those who received placebo. Overall, among the participants who received COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine BNT16 2b2, 51.5% were male and 48.5% were female, 82.1% were White, 9.6% were Black or African American, 26.1% were Hispanic/Latino, 4.3% were Asian and 0.7% were Native American/Alaskan native. The most frequent adverse reactions in participants 16 years of a ge and older were pain at the injection site (> 80%), fatigue (> 60%), headache (> 50%), myalgia (> 30%), arthralgia (> and injection site swelling (> 10%) . The safety profile in 545 subjects receiving COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 , that were seropositive for SARS -CoV -2 at baseline, was similar to that seen in the general population. Adolescents 12 to 15 years of age In an analysis of Study 2, based on data up to the cut-off date of 13 March 2021 , -19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 ; 1,129 placebo) were 12 to 15 years of age. Of these, 1,308 adolescents (660 COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 and 648 pl acebo) have been followed for at least 2 months after the second dose of COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 . The most frequent adverse reactions in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age were injection site pain (> 90%), fatigue and headache (> 70%), myalgia and chills (> 40%), arthralgia and pyrexia (> All participants 8 Ref:SPC BNT1 62 UK 1 2_0 The most frequent adverse reactions were usually mild or moderate in intensity and resolved within a few days after vaccination. A slightly lower frequency of reactogeni city events was associated with greater age. If required, symptomatic treatment with analgesic and/or anti -pyretic medicinal products (e.g. paracetamol -containing products) may be used. Tabulated list of adverse reactions from clinical studies and post -authorisation experience Adverse reactions observed during clinical studies are listed below according to the following frequency categories: Very common ( 1/10), Common ( < 1/1,000) , Very rare (< 1/10,000), Not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Table 1: Adverse reactions from clinical trials and post -authorisation experience System Organ Class Very common ( 1/10) Common ( 1/100 to Rare ( 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000) Not known (cannot be estimated from the available data) Blood and lymphatic system disorders Lymphadenopathy Cardiac disorders Myocarditis , pericarditisc (e.g. rash, pruritus, urticaria,a angioedemaa) Anaphylaxis Psychiatric disorders Insomnia Nervous system disorders Headache Acute peripheral facial paralysis b Gastrointestinal disorders Diarrhoeac Nausea ; Vomitingc Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders Arthralgia; Myalgia Pain in extremityd General disorders and administration site conditions Injection site pain; Fatigue; Chills; Pyrexia e; Injection site swelling Malaise; Injection site pruritus 9 Ref:SPC BNT1 62 UK 1 2_0 a. The frequency category for urticaria and angioedema was Rare. b. Through the clinical trial safety follow -up period to 14 November 2020, acute peripheral facial paralysis (or palsy) was reported by four participants in the COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine group. Onset was Day 37 after Dose 1 (participant did not receive Dose 2) and Days 3, 9, and 48 after Dose 2. No cases of acute peripheral facial paralysis (or palsy) were reported in the placebo group. c. Adverse reaction determined post -authorisation. d. Refers to vaccinated arm. e. A higher frequency of pyrexia was observed after the second dose. Post-authorisation reports of influenza -like illness Some recipients have reported chills, shivering (in some case s rigo urs), and increased body temperature possibly with sweating, headache (including migraine -like headaches), nausea, myalgia and malaise, starting within a day of vaccination. These effects usually last for a day or two. If a patient reports unusuall y high and prolonged fever, or other persistent symptoms, alternative causes should be considered and appropriate advice should be provided for diagnostic investigation and medical management as required. Reporting of suspected adverse reactions If you are concerned about an adverse event, it should be reported on a Yellow card. Reporting forms and information can be found at https://coronavirus -yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk/ or search for MHRA Yellow Card in the Google Play or Apple App Store . When reporting please include the vaccine brand and batch/Lot number if available. Alternatively, adverse events of concern in association with Pfizer BioNTech COVID -19 mRNA vaccine BNT162b2 can be reported to Pfizer Medical Information o n 01304 616161 or via www.pfizersafetyreporting.com . Please do not report the same adverse event(s) to both systems as all reports will be shared between Pfizer and MHRA (in an anonymized form) and dual reporting will create unnecessary duplicates. 4.9 Overdose Participants who received 58 micrograms of COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine in clinical trials did not report an increase in reactogenicity or adverse events . In the event of overdose, monitoring of vital functions and possible symptomatic treatment is recommended. 5. PHARMACODYNAMIC PROPERTIES 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties Pharmacotherapeutic group: vaccines, other viral vaccines, ATC code: J07BX 03 Mechanism of action The nucleoside -modified messenger RNA in COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 is formulated in lipid nanoparticles, which enable delivery of the RNA into host cells to allow expression of the SARS - CoV -2 S antige n. The vaccine elicits both neutrali sing antibody and cellular immune responses to the spike (S) antigen, which may contribute to protection against COVID -19 disease. Efficacy in participants 16 years of age and older The efficacy of COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 was evaluated in participants 16 years of age and older in two clinical studies conducted in the United States, Europe, Turkey, South Africa and South America. Study 1 enrolled 60 participants , 18 through 55 years of age . Study 2 is a multicentre, placebo -controlled efficacy study in participants 12 years of age and older. Randomisation was stratified by age : 12 through 15 years of age, 16 through 55 years of age, or 56 years of age and older, with a minimum of 40% of participants in the 56-year stratum. The study excluded participants who 10 Ref:SPC BNT1 62 UK 1 2_0 were immunocompromised and those who had previous clinical or microbiological diagnosis of COVID -19 disease . Participants with pre -existing stable disease, defined as disease not requiring significant change in therapy or hospitali sation for worsening disease during the 6 weeks before enrolment, were included as were participants with known stable infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) or hepatitis B virus (HBV). There was no requirement for prophylactic use of paracetamol or analgesics. Influenza vaccines could be administered outside a window \u00b1 14 days of the vaccine doses . In Study 2, approximately 44,000 participants 12 years of age and older were randomised equally and received 2 doses of COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine or placebo with a planned interval of 21 days. The efficacy analyses included participants that received their second vaccination within 19 to 42 days after their first vaccination. Participants are planned to be followed for up to 24 months, for assessments of safety and efficacy against COVID -19 disease . The population for the analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint included 36,621 participants 12 years of age and older (18,242 in the COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine group and 18,379 in the placebo group) who did not have evidence of prior infection with SARS -CoV -2 through 7 day s after the second dose. Demographic characteristics were generally similar with regard to age, gender, race and ethnicity among participants who received COVID -19 mRNA BNT162b2 v accine and those who received placebo. Overall, among the participants who received COVID -19 mRNA vaccine, 51. 1% were male and 48. 9% were female, 8 2.8% were White, 8.9% were Black or African American, 26. 8% were Hispanic/Latino, 4. 5% were Asian and 0. 6% were Native American/Alaskan native. 57.2% were aged 16-55 years, 4 2.6% were aged > 55 years and 21. 8% wer e 65 years. The vaccine efficacy information is presented in Table 2.

In Study 2 an analysis of SARS -CoV -2 neutralising titres in a randomly selected subset of participants was performed to demonstrate non -inferior immune responses (within 1.5 -fold) comparing adolescents 12 to 15 years of age to participants 16 to 25 years o f age who had no serological or virological evidence of past SARS -CoV-2 infection. The immune response to COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age (n = 190) was non -inferior to the immune response in participants 16 to 25 years o f age (n = 170), based on results for SARS -CoV -2 neutralising titres at 1 month after Dose 2. The geometric mean titres (GMT) ratio of the adolescents 12 to 15 years of age group to the participants 16 to 25 years of age group was 1.76, with a 2 -sided 95% CI of 1.47 to 2.10, meeting the 1.5 -fold non -inferiority criterion (the lower bound of the 2 -sided 95% CI for the geometric mean ratio [GMR] > 0.67) and indicat ing a statistically greater response in the adolescents 12 to 15 years of age than that of parti cipants 16 to 25 years of age. 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties Not applicable. 5.3 Preclinical safety data Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on a conventional stud y of repeat dose toxicity. Reproductive toxicity Reproductive and developmental toxicity were investigated in rats in a combined fertility and developmental toxicity study where female rats were intramuscularly administered with the COVID - 19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 prior to mating an d during gestation (receiving 4 full human doses that generate relatively higher levels in rat due to body weight differences, spanning between pre -mating day 21 and gestational day 20). SARS -CoV -2 neutralizing antibody responses were present in maternal a nimals from prior to mating to the end of the study on postnatal day 21 as well as in foetuses and offspring. There were no vaccine -related effects on female fertility, pregnancy, or embryo -foetal or offspring development. No data on the COVID -19 mRNA Vacc ine BNT162b2 are available on vaccine placental transfer or excretion in milk. 6.

Store in t he thermal container at -90\u00baC to -60\u00baC . Store in the original package in order to protect from light. Once removed from the freezer , the undiluted vaccine can be stored for up to 1 month (31 days) at 2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C, and up to 2 hours at temperatures up to 25\u00b0C, prior to use. During storage, minimise exposure to room light, and avoid exposure to direct sunlight and ultraviolet light . Thawed vials can be handled in room light conditions. After dilution, store the vaccine at 2\u00b0C to 25\u00b0C and use as soon as practically possible and within 6 hours. The vaccine does not contain a preservative. Discard any unused vaccine . Once diluted, the vials should be marked with the dilution time and discarded within 6 hours of dilution. Once thawed, the vaccine cannot be re -frozen. 6.5 Nature and contents of container Concentrate for solution for injection for 6 doses in a 2 mL clear vial (type I glass) with a stopper (bromobutyl) and a flip -off plastic cap with aluminium seal , see section 4.2. Pack size: 195 vials 6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling When removed from the freezer, the vaccine has a maximum possible shelf life of up to 1 month (31 days) when stored at 2 -8\u00b0C (label to be added once box removed fr om freezer). A 195 vial pack may take 3 hours to thaw at 2-8\u00b0C. The product can alternatively be defrosted and kept for up to 2 hours at up to 25 \u00baC before being diluted for use. This facilitates immediate thaw and use when removed directly from the freeze r to 25\u00baC. In this instance the product is to be diluted within 2 hours of removing from the freezer. Once thawed, the vaccine cannot be refrozen. After dilution the vaccine should be used as soon as is practically possible and within 6 hours of dilution; it can be stored at 2 -25\u00baC during this period. From a microbiological point of view, i t would not normally be considered good practice to store a diluted product for 6 hours at 25 \u00baC before being administered. The product would ideally be used as soon as practically possible after dilution. The vaccine does not contain a preservative. Discard any unused vaccine . 14 Ref:SPC BNT1 62 UK 1 2_0 Any unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements.
