Videos Video: Meet family medicine doctor Kevin Beene, MD - Hi, I'm Kevin Beene, a family medicine with obstetrics doctor. While I was growing up in Milwaukee, Wisconsin I witnessed a lot of health disparities and when I went to college I was studying biomedical engineering and originally thought that that was kind of the branch of medicine and healthcare that was the best fit for me. But ultimately, through volunteering at hospitals and really having more direct patient care, did I realize that actually being a medical provider was what was most fulfilling for me. So I am a true Wisconsinite and stayed in Madison Wisconsin for my medical degree after I finished my bachelor's and master's degrees. From there, came to Seattle for my residency training in family medicine and have really enjoyed staying here in Seattle. It's a wonderful place to practice medicine and I've really enjoyed growing my practice here. I see everyone from newborn babies to pregnant people to older adults. Also, as a obstetrics provider, I manage pregnancy and prenatal care, so I can see people at the very start of their pregnancy and for routine visits for prenatal care. And then I also see them in the hospital delivering babies. My hope is that when patients come to see me they feel like I'm listening and that I'm hearing them and that they have the autonomy to make decisions about their own health and their own bodies and that I can provide the information that they need in order to make those informed decisions. So when I'm not at work, I really enjoy being outside whether that's going for runs or going on the water and paddle boarding or going for hikes. And Seattle's really a great place for all of those things. It's got wonderful outdoors so I've loved that part of my life here. If you're looking for a provider who is really passionate about medicine, really enjoys getting to know people and also really wants to support you in whatever that means for maintaining your health or improving your health then I might be the right provider for you.

I'm a Urologist here at The Polyclinic. I went into medicine for the same reason I would hope anyone would go into medicine for just the desire to help people. You get to do something different every day. You're not sitting behind a desk all the time and you can, you know, actually see tangible ways that you're helping people. I'm originally from the Seattle area. I left the area to go to medical school at the University of Colorado in Denver, Colorado and then completed a residency in Urology at the University of Minnesota, in Minneapolis. As a Urologist, I see patients 18 and up with issues of the genital urinary tract. So that means anything from the kidneys, ureter, bladder on out of the body. I think my approach to patient care is to, for a lot of things, let the patient drive a lot of their care. Some things are straightforward, like if someone has a big ureteral stone that needs to be treated, but a lot of things in urology are subjective and what may be very bothersome to one person not so bothersome to someone else. So really, taking in someone's values of what's important to them and how they wanna proceed down the road to potentially observation medication surgery. Just trying to really understand the entire patient before really making any sort of decision. Outside of work I like to spend time with my family, my wife, dog, cat, two toddlers. I do a lot of running. We like to get up to the mountains or out to the islands just spend time enjoying the outdoors. Meet urologist Daniel Smith, MD 2 min "}
