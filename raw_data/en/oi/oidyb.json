Whenever a non-profit advocacy, patient or professional group opens itself up to accu - sations that it is acting as a front for a com - mercial company, all groups and allcompanies find themselves under suspi - cion. But there are many reasons to resist aknee-jerk reaction on either side to pullback from any form of cooperation. Pharmaceutical companies are in the cancer business to make money. And yet as long as we need better drugs to addressexisting unmet need in cancer, their interests overlap with many non-profit groups. Com- mercial firms have a long tradition of sup-porting advocacy groups and campaigns,some of which have had a sustained impacton the quality of care that cancer patientsreceive. These campaigns can benefit fromthe industry's resources and experience inresearch, marketing and communications aswell as financial support. But they can alsoopen themselves up to accusations of biasand hidden agendas, which can backfirebadly on the campaign. Some voices in this debate argue that it is impossible to prove there is no hiddenagenda, and that any form of partnershipwith commercial interests fatally compro-mises the independence of non-profit\u00a7 Kathy Redmond IEDITOR groups. But independence is of little use without the resources to run a democraticorganisation that can make an impact whereit matters. In an ideal world, all the stakeholders active in the cancer arena should be able towork constructively towards shared goals, while acknowledging areas of conflicting interests. The challenge is to define how thecorporate world can work with the non-profit world without undermining the repu-tation of all involved. It may be impossible ever to allay the sus - picions of hardline sceptics, but public con-fidence in general may be satisfied withanswers to the following questions: which commercial concerns are contributing what, and what are they getting in return? Whodecides on the agenda and the way it is pur- sued, and to whom are they accountable? Many non-profit cancer groups are now negotiating a more arm's length relationshipwith their industry sponsors, developingpolicies that clearly spell out the rules ofengagement. Many companies and industryassociations are going through similar exer-cises. Some voices have long been calling fora single, simple set of agreed standards toprotect those who follow best practice frombeing tainted by those who do not. Thereare many obstacles to achieving such a goal,but given what is at stake, it is importantthat all stakeholders take a fresh look at theway forward. Otherwise, a build up of neg-ative headlines could prompt politicians totake unilateral action.A question of public trust CoverStory 4ICANCER WORLD 2007Jan Foubert: champion of cancer nursing \u00a7 Marc Beishon Jan F oubert knows the value of a good cancer nurse - someone who understands the patient' s needs, knows how to help them cope with the disease, symptoms and side-effects and hasskills to apply that knowledge. He believes it's up to Europe's nurses to redefine their role incancer care - but he'd also welcome a bit more support from the other oncology disciplines. If there is one factor that can help a core oncology specialty to develop aroundEurope it is consistent and long-term lead - ership, which European cancer nurses have enjoyed in recent years in the form of Jan F oubert. His credentials include a back- ground in paediatric oncology nursing, academic nursing positions at the Erasmus institute of higher education and the Free University in Brus-sels, and he is the immediate past president andlongstanding board member of EONS, the Euro-pean Oncology Nursing Society. Most recently,the US Oncology Nursing Society selected himfor their International Award for Contributions toCancer Care, which he will receive at the ONSAnnual Congress next April. It is, however, a new role at EONS that will cement his relationship with the nursing cause inEurope. \"I have accepted an executive director'spost, that will allow the society to build on all theprojects and development work I've been involvedwith as a board member,\" he says. While the detailsof the new post are to be decided - he will also con-tinue with his teaching duties in part - his directionis unequivocal. \"I've just turned down two other jobs so I can work with EONS - a director's post atFECS (the F ederation of European Cancer Soci - eties) and a principal's position at the university.\" Those who have encountered Foubert on the conference circuit and as a board member ofEONS and FECS will not be surprised by his decision. While always open to discussion, he has long been of the view that Europe's oncology nurs-es - and there are around 30,000 in EONS - needa strong, independent voice, and they have enjoyedprecious little support from the medical oncologycommunity, despite the supposed rise of multidis-ciplinary working. Further, although oncology nurs-ing has developed as a specialty in a few countries,the overall picture is very fragmented in terms ofrecognition, educational opportunities and require-ments, and clinical knowledge and research. In fact, Foubert feels there is an urgent need to address what he calls a 'loss of identity' among thenursing community generally . \"A shocking defini - tion I've heard of a nurse is that they do things that can also be done by others,\" he says. \"What a lot ofnurses still do goes back to the days of FlorenceCoverStory CANCER WORLD I JANUARY/FEBRUARY 2007 I 5\"Nurses complain about respect and image - but we have to create our own image and earn respect\" ELIGIOPAONI/ CONTRASTOCoverStory 6I CANCER WORLD I JANUARY/FEBRUARY 2007Nightingale - basic care and being dependent on doctors to tell them what to do.\" While there are, of course, many specialised and advanced posts in oncology - such as pain management and tumour-specific roles, and some senior nurses acting as'mini-doctors', as Foubert puts it - there is a dan-ger of the bulk of bedside nursing remaining stuck in an assistant nursing role, suffering from a lack of knowledge and empowerment. \"Governments willsay, 'Why should we pay so many registered nurs - es when one or two can coordinate the care?'\" The present-day situation is exacerbated, he adds, by societal changes that have seen nursesless valued than they were. \"The uniform and presence once meant you were respected - now society sees nursing as any other job. Nursesoften complain about respect and image - but wehave to create our own image and earn respect.\" It is the majority - the bedside oncology nurse - who F oubert has most in mind in his work to help raise the profile and professional attain-ment of nursing. Apart from his involvement in the politics and strategic agenda setting for EONS, his teaching experience has no doubt informed the development of the society' s most important programmes so far. These include educational initiatives such as TITAN, which deals with thrombocytopoenia, anaemia and neu-tropoenia - conditions where nurses can play keytreatment roles - taught in a way that shows howsuch potentially forbidding topics can be shapedto be of practical value and not discarded asbeing too theoretical. Foubert's own pathway into a nursing career was quite remarkable. Brought up in Germany, he hadinitial ideas about being a psychologist, until afriend of his mother , a night sister at a hospital, invited him to spend a shift with her - wheresomeone died. \"He was put in bed in a bathroom,with no one with him. I thought, 'This can' t be right.'\" Then in a school holiday he found himselfvisiting a nursing home for older people withdementia, again through a family contact. \"Thedirector was looking for holiday help - I went on a tour with my mother and in one room there were four women, one of whom was spreading faeces on a hot radiator. I stayed and did the evening shift. Mymother couldn't understand it.\" This highly unlikely holiday job for a teenage boy - which was probably illegal - was nevertheless highly stimulating, although F oubert says he had to grow up rather rapidly. He was determined then toqualify as a nurse, which he duly did at a nursingschool in Brussels, and then went to a new hospi - tal, Queen Fabiola Children's University Hospital,also in Belgium, as a paediatric intensive carenurse. University training, as he often says to his students today, hardly prepares you for the realities of such a job, but in this unit he was able to learnquickly about all manner of high-, medium- andlow-intensive care situations. Foubert was also able to fit in a master' s degree, specialising in hospital science, which also had aneducational option, meaning he was then equippedto teach other nurses. \"The hospital director askedme to build up hygiene practices in the hospital, and then one day called me in and offered me the head nurse position in the paediatric oncologyward - I had to take it there and then.\" He notes: \"As a new nurse you have to be visible to the deci- sion makers so that they can see that you have com-petencies that can be of use for the organisation.Don't follow the crowd.\" Foubert realised he knew next to nothing about oncology. \"The doctors might as well have beentalking Chinese,\" he says, adding that today's nurs-es receive little oncology teaching on undergradu-ate courses, which hardly stimulates them to lookat specialised postgraduate cancer options. In amonth or so he had read up on cancer to the extentthat he felt he knew more than most on the unit,and brought his intensive care skills to bear -showing other nurses how to perform a resuscita - tion in one case and how to monitor and assess chil-dren in a critical situation on an oncology ward. He also led the reorganisation of the unit. Nurs esToo often, trainee nurses bursting with ideas end up in units where there is little scope to change thingsCoverStory CANCER WORLD I JANUARY/FEBRUARY 2007 I 7needs of patients, which makes oncology nursing no different from general nursing. I was busy with nursing shortages, and generally the hospital, likemany others, was firefighting and found it hard togo forward with nursing development.\" With other cancer centres springing up in Bel- gium, all starting to do similar things, adds Foubert,it becomes difficult to maintain a unique reference presence. His main focus there was as a nurse champion, visiting every unit each day, and payingparticular attention to the needs of head nurses,who he says can often be in very isolated positions. Foubert went on to become a continuing edu- cation coordinator at Jules Bordet, while starting a teaching career as a lecturer in nursing and mid-wifery at Erasmus. He still has a strong link withJules Bordet, however , as he runs a fatigue clinic there half a day each week - fatigue is a specialwere working on only one of several areas, such as ambulant care or closed bone marrow treatment rooms, and they were asked to vary their work. Thisproved unpopular with some (who then left). Someevidence-based practice was brought in - such as theuse of specially prepared sterile food for bone mar-row patients. \"It was from my master's study that Ishowed the food we could get from commercial sources was much safer than food we prepared our- selves - all we needed was a decent kitchen with astore of safe food in a fridge, and a microwave.\" These two themes - challenging ingrained habits and introducing evidence-based nursing - have become central to F oubert' s views about developing nursing practice. \"If there is one profession that is dif-ficult to change, it is nursing,\" he says. \"Nurse train - ing is about a lot of theories and models - but whenyou go into practice you don't often see them.\" Toooften, he reckons, trainee nurses bursting with ideasend up in units where there is little scope to change things, although there are some places where being assertive and dynamic is welcome. \"But the mostfrustrating thing a new nurse hears is, 'W e have always done it this way.'\" Meanwhile, at the children' s hospital, F oubert and a doctor colleague who had been working in theUS brought in outside finance to equip the oncol-ogy department with TVs and toys, and decent bed - side clinical equipment. \"I realised that to build a unit you need charitable donations, which we obtained from business people. It became an exem - plar unit, visited once by Princess Diana. Everyone wanted to see it.\" It was on a Europe Against Cancer course that Foubert was noticed by the director of the JulesBordet Institute in Brussels, Belgium's only dedi-cated cancer centre, and he moved there as anurse manager, taking a step away from the bedside.\"At the time this was an ideal place - one of the fewhospitals doing rehabilitation, pain management,stoma therapy, breast cancer nursing and so on. Itwas a pioneer, particularly in rehabilitation underpsycho-oncologist Darius Razavi.\" However, Foubert says that it is all too easy to lose leadership status, which he feels happened atJules Bordet from his nursing perspective. \"Y ou need to keep on top of protocols, standard careplans, clinical pathways and quality - things youcan measure - and not just take care of the basic FATIGUE - GOOD ADVICE IS KEY Fatigue has become one of the mor e difficult side-effects for healthcare pro- fessionals to tackle, despite it being one of the most common complaints ofcancer patients. \"Doctors and nurses tend not to be inter ested in it because its origin is not known - they pr efer to treat symptoms such as pain, where they know they can do something,\" says Foubert. At the recent World Congress ofPsycho-Oncology , he pr esented a case study of someone with fatigue and bor - derline anaemia. \"The only questions from doctors were about the anaemia - it was a psychologist who asked me how you measure stress levels and was interested in the problem of fatigue in cancer survivors. \"Also, what I've learnt in my fatigue clinic is that most studies on fatigue have been done on patients undergoing treatment, but it can continue in peo-ple who are cured or no longer treated - there is little available on this pop-ulation in the literature.\" Fatigue management should be integrated as a standard care plan, as with pain management - but it is not happening in most places, according to Foubert.He says nurses are well placed to develop management strategies by approach- ing the problem as a lifestyle issue, in a similar way to a dietician advising on weight loss. \"If you want to lose weight I can coach and motivate you - but youare the only one who can lose weight. Fatigue is the same - you have to change your lifestyle and habits and think about how you deal with reduced energy.\" This can touch on painful personal issues. \"When I ask women with families,'When was the last time you did something for yourself?,' they often start cry-ing. When someone is diagnosed with cancer, the emphasis is on the waragainst it - the tr eatment - and not how you come to ter ms with it. We have to change our minds about lifestyle issues being too difficult to tackle.\" CoverStory 8I CANCER WORLD I JANUARY/FEBRUARY 2007interest and one especially relevant to oncology nursing (see box). At the same time, an involvement with EONS started to take off. Initially, he had littleknowledge of European oncology societies, orconferences such as ECCO (the European Can-cer Conference). That was all to change as he quickly made his presence felt, soon being invit - ed to become an EONS board member. \"When I first became involved, EONS was look - ing at the status of oncology nurses, especially ineastern European countries. It's still the case thatthere are major differences in status in Europebetween east and west and north and south - and what I saw was that EONS could only be important if we could reach the bedside nurse,those who do not normally have the opportuni - ty to go to conferences. That was my goal fromday one, and I'm happy to report that, by the timemy presidency of EONS came to an end, we hadincreased membership to 32 national oncologybodies from 28 countries.\" EONS has a core strategy under the acronym CARE - meaning Communications, influencing the Agenda, Research and Education - and edu- cation has been the most important main activ- ity, and should remain so, according to Foubert. \"It is the biggest need of European oncologynurses,\" he says, noting a number of challenges,from increasingly specialised cancer treatments,to shorter hospital stays (which may mean com-munity nurses needing some cancer expertise),to changing role boundaries in hospitals, withsome countries allowing what were previouslymedical procedures to be carried out by nurses- those 'mini-doctors'. He would also like EONSto be the platform to launch specialist nursinggroups, such as for breast cancer, palliative careand geriatric oncology. According to F oubert, what has been lacking are educational packages that address real needs- rather than supposed requirements - and alsomaterials that are usable across the many differentcultural healthcare environments in Europe. \"What used to happen was that the industry would bring out a pack, say on nausea and vomiting, for nurses, but there was no research on whetherthere was a need for it, and what the current stateof knowledge was. Also, much educational mate-rial has come from the UK. While some of this is very valuable - such as materials on biological ther - apies - it is much too complicated for the bedsidenurse, and of course it is written or presented inEnglish, not a common language for many nurses.Bedside nurses don't want an all-day lecture - theywant practical, interactive training that they canactually implement.\" What has also been missing, he adds, is eval- uation of the impact of education and the dis - semination or use of the new knowledge. \"W e assume that people who have been educated willperform better . When I was an education man - ager, if a problem came up, managers said nurs- es need to be trained and the problem will besolved. That' s nonsense.\" Educational programmes at EONS, says Fou- bert, now emphasise needs assessment, piloting, evaluation and dissemination, and don' t just assume that the training alone is enough. The first initiative was NOEP (Nutrition in Oncolo- gy Educational Program), launched in 2003,and a raft of other programmes with impressivesounding acronyms have since got underway,such as TITAN, BONE (BisphosphonatesOncology Nurses Education), Speak Up! (dia-logue with patients on nausea and vomiting)and Target (training in targeted therapies). TITAN is being rolled out across Europe by national oncology nursing bodies. So far, morethan 2,000 nurses have taken the course in 21European countries, and it is now spreadingworldwide, with Australia running its debutcourse last November . Foubert - who travels to teach it himself - says cultural adaptability is a key marker ofsuccess. \"I was in Slovenia at the Institute of\"A bedside nurse wants practical, interactive training that they can actually implement\"CoverStory CANCER WORLD I JANUARY/FEBRUARY 2007 I 9Team TITAN. At ECCO 13 with colleaguesfrom the training course on thrombocytopoenia,anaemia and neutropoenia whichwas developed by EONS and is nowtaught all over the world Oncology in Ljubljana recently - they have translated the materials, and even attended thetraining in English on a Saturday.\" But there canbe obstacles to overcome. \"In this case, a mediccalled the nurse director and said they could notgive this course as there is no medical doctorspeaking - how can nurses possibly explainanaemia management? It was cleared, though,by asking the medical director, who supportedthe nurse director . This sort of situation still aris - es in some countries.\" The educational approach that EONS is devel- oping is also designed to fit in with the BolognaAgreement, the European Union programme thataims to standardise higher education acrossEurope - examples are a core curriculum for can -cer in older people and the EONS post-basic core curriculum in oncology nursing. Foubert is concerned by a global lack of atten- tion to 'evidence-based nursing' - he feels there isa pressing need to evaluate how research cantranslate into effective practice in often complexcare situations. Existing models, he says, \"are notappropriate for the complex interventions inwhich the experience of the patient plays animportant role in effectiveness. The context ofcare in a complex nursing situation is almostnever the same, and that is where evidence-basednursing fails, as its principle is that the situationis always identical.\" The solution, he adds, lies innurses receiving training in scientific research -and researchers in clinical research. \"The context of care in a complex situation is never the same - that's where evidence-based nursing fails\" CoverStory 10 I CANCER WORLD I JANUARY/FEBRUARY 2007An example close to his heart - especially with his experience with children - is the assumed need in many units to wear protective clothing when with patients, say with neutropoenia, whoare at high risk of infection. As even newborns in incubators - one of the best protected places in a hospital - are colonised by many bacteriawithin 72 hours, evidence now points to aban-doning protective isolation, with subsequentbenefits for patient contact (such as being ableto hold a child). But for such initiatives tobecome the norm, says Foubert, training, meas-uring and monitoring, reflection on currentpractices and above all nursing leadership arerequired. He cites thoughts from various academics about how advanced practice nurses can 'unitethe worlds of scholarship and practice,' and thatnursing, like all healthcare, needs 'knowledgeworkers' with skills such as leadership and del-egation, clinical judgement, teamwork and use ofnew technologies. It all adds up to a substantial agenda - and for allies in the effort, Foubert says partnerships with patient advocacy organisations offer one of the best ways forward. \"Nurses are often closer to patients thandoctors, and can be of great help when patients have to make decisions,\" he says, adding that EONS is forming close links with leading advoca-cy organisations, such as Europa Donna and ECPC(European Cancer Patient Coalition). \"Patientsand nurses together are much stronger than on theirown and have much more power than the medicsat the political level,\" he says. He is direct about problems he sees with doctor-patient communication. \"Although mostdoctors say patients are important, they are oftenafraid to involve them in decision making. WhenI was on the board of FECS and other advisoryboards I kept saying, 'Shouldn't we ask patients?'How else are we to know what they think andneed?\" A particular bugbear for him is educa-tional material given out by nurses that has hadno input from patient groups. ELIGIOPAONI/ CONTRASTOCoverStory CANCER WORLD I JANUARY/FEBRUARY 2007 I 11This is not to say that nurses can assume they are close to patients - factors such as the shorter time patients spend having treatment make communications more difficult, whilecommunications itself is a skill that needstraining. Further, doctors have an advantage inthat communication about, for example, a cer- tain treatment is easier , as there is a specific goal in mind. \"Years ago I did research for apatient league in Belgium that found patientswere more satisfied with explanations they gotfrom doctors, who may have carried out hun-dreds of the same procedure. I think that nurs - es often talk to patients without a clear objective in mind.\" As part of solving the nurse 'identity crisis', Foubert feels that making more of being an advocate who makes time to know patientsbetter will help, and he is an advocate himselfof having nurse case managers to provide con - tinuity and a single point of contact for a patient- currently an 'unusual role'. On the wider stage, Foubert is organising the patient programme at the next ECCO meeting in Barcelona, previously managed bydoctors. He sees this as an interim step to handing over the job to a patient organisation such as ECPC. As he says, he knows how to'work the system', through working with FECSand EONS, and is hopeful that the patientadvocacy organisations will avoid the mistakehe feels that oncology doctors have made -speaking with too many voices. \"It has been verydifficult for politicians to know who to listen to.I hope the patient organisations will avoid hav-ing too many lobby groups.\" These concerns played a role in his recent decision to turn down the offer of a director'sjob at FECS. \"I was honoured, and may wellhave accepted a post to run the conferenceside earlier in 2006 - but I don't want to be partof lobbying, as the mission of FECS is still notclear to me.\"It was certainly a brave step to offer Foubert that FECS post given his trenchant views on multi- disciplinary working and the tough time he had as a board member, where he often spoke hismind. \"When doctors talk about multidiscipli-nary teams they usually mean medics and notnurses. But nurses have to earn their place on the team - and that has to do with image, respect and leadership.\" Foubert is a member of the ethics committee at the F ree University of Brussels, a post he enjoys greatly and where he feels among equals.As for his lecturing post, he admits he' s known as a pretty strict teacher , not tolerating lateness or backchat, but says he applies himself more asa mentor and coach, taking a lot of time to helpstudents achieve goals. \"T eaching is just explain- ing things - but coaching is, say, going on prac-tice with students and working together towardsobjectives.\" Any new job for Foubert will have to accommodate at least part-time teaching - it's alove he won' t relinquish. Foubert and his partner live in Antwerp, where he's forced himself to get out to cultural activities such as opera and ballet by buying season tickets.Long cycle rides are also on the agenda, and he likes entertaining - but not with prepackaged foods. A favourite book is The Queen and I , by Sue Townsend, which imagines Britain's Royal Fam-ily forced to live as ordinary, poor citizens - but anythought of bringing down medics a peg or two ispurely coincidental. \"I have made a clear choice about my future by taking on the daily business of EONS,\" saysFoubert. \"If I'm honest, I can't say I've been theaverage nurse; I'm a man and I did notencounter any major opposition at work as anurse. Now I'm travelling everywhere, staying atthe best hotels. I recognise that it's easy for meto say to nurses, 'Stand up for your rights,' but I hope I'm respected enough for nurses to knowI really do mean to close the gap between theworst off and the best.\" \"Patients and nurses together have much more power than the medics at the political level\" Grand Round 14 ICANCER WORLD IJANUARY/FEBRUARY 2007A second opinion, because there's no second chance \u00a7 Marc Beishon Patients want the option of consulting a second doctor , and the evidence shows that, for a minority of them, treatment decisions have altered significantly as a result. But could granting every patientthe legal right to a second opinion tie up precious resources as each one 'shops around' in search ofthe opinion they want to hear? \"Iwish we had checked there was nothing else we couldhave done\" - it' s one of the common regrets of the rel- atives of people who have died from cancer , and a reminder that worries about treatment can extend beyond the patient to possibly many years of soul searching by those leftbehind. Access to second opinionsabout diagnosis and treatment can pro-vide vital reassurance for patients andtheir families at a time when they feelmost vulnerable, and reassurance is acommon reason for asking for referralsto other specialists, or for people seek-ing information independently, partic-ularly on the Internet. \"I see three types of patients looking for second opinions on treatment,\" saysFatima Cardoso, a medical oncologist at the Jules Bordet Institute in Brus-sels. \"There are those who are happywith their doctor and just want to bereassured they are having the best care. Some say they don't want their oncol-ogist to know , just confirmation that he or she is correct. Then there is a group who are unhappy with the relationship with their doctor , and the third group are people looking for new treatments and trials, normally referred on by their oncologist. We see all these types ofpatient and do a lot of second opinions- I wouldn't say one reason is morecommon than another.\" The reasons why patients seek sec- ond opinions in cancer, and in medi-cine generally, raise many issues, someof which have not been wellresearched. Clearly, the opportunitiesfor patients to research medicine inthe Internet age is of primary interest.It is increasingly changing the face ofthe traditional doctor-patient tionship, with although manypatients remain reluctant to 'distrust'their specialist, while there are still a minority of 'paternalistic' doctors whodo not encourage second opinions. Then there is the question of whether a healthcare system or socie- ty should grant legal or just moral rightsto obtaining second opinions. In turn, there are questions about cost and structure - should a second opinionsystem be formalised for some or allcomplex conditions, and would therebe a net cost, or would there be savingsthanks to better treatment? And couldthere be enough capacity to carry outmore formal second opinions? A good place to start to answer these questions is to look at what datathere are on where second opinionshave made a difference to cancer treat-ment. Much of the emphasis in studiesappears to be on the diagnosis of can - cer - and any patient researching theissue will immediately find alarmingwarnings about mistakes that are made.Grand Round CANCER WORLD I JANUARY/FEBRUARY 2007 I 15Not surprisingly, these warnings appear mostly on US patient advocacy web- sites, and also on the websites of can- cer centres in the US that offer secondopinion services. AN ENORMOUS IMPACT For example, one of the most widely cited studies examined the impact of amandatory second opinion for surgicalpathology when cases were referred toa major cancer centre, John HopkinsHospital, in the US, during a period inthe mid-1990s. The study found that such a programme could \"result in major therapeutic and prognostic mod - ifications,\" and although the number ofaffected cases was not large, theauthors considered that the rate of dis - crepant diagnoses \"may have enormoushuman and financial impact,\" ( Cancer 86:2426-35). Another study, on pathology second opinions for breast cancer, 'confirmed' the benefit of a pathology second opin - ion, noting major changes that altered surgical therapy in 7.8% of 346 cases. Complete correlation between the ini-tial report and the second opinion wasfound in just 20% of cases. However,failure to confirm a malignant diagnosisoccurred in only one case, but theauthors note that benign diagnoses areseldom subject to a second opinion( Ann Surg Oncol 9:982-987). This is a huge topic in its own right, but it seems to be the case thatpatients are not as likely to seek secondopinions on pathology and scan resultsas they are about prognosis and treat - ment. \"Questions about the diagnosisare seldom raised by patients,\" saysJ\u00fcrgen Schultze, a radiation oncologistat Kiel University in Germany. \"As I am also trained as a radiologist, I do deal with false-negative and false- positive results, but the questions arenormally raised by other doctors whoare not convinced that the findings ofthe original radiologist are right.\" It is very rare to see a misdiagnosis of malignant or benign tumours addsCardoso. \"There is some controversy inthe classification of some types of can - cer - for example, you have a lot of dis-cordance in grading in breast cancerand some pathologists do grade differ - ently - and when you use techniquessuch as immunohistochemistry , you can get different results. I think,though, that pathologists are moreadvanced than clinicians in asking forsecond opinions among themselves -they have been in the habit for manyyears of exchanging slides when theyare not sure about a diagnosis and will send them to experts around the world. It's much less frequent that a clinicianwill send a patient for a second opinion because he is not certain.\" Clearly, though, there is a big dif- ference between routine checking ofpathology specimens and images forquality control purposes, and referral toa centre where different imaging and pathology tests may be done as part of a new patient consultation. Anotherstudy on 148 women who went to theUniversity of Michigan Breast CareCenter for a second consultation fol-lowing a mammogram found that 7%had more cancer in the same breast, or an undiagnosed tumour in the other breast. But this was after a one-dayradiology , surgery and pathology con- sultation, with many patients receivingadditional imaging, resulting in addi - tional or different biopsies, additionalfollow-up imaging and changes to treat-ment in 30% of the women. The superiority of the top multi- disciplinary cancer centres as places for diagnosis and treatment is hardly aSecond opinions in breast cancer pathology led to altered surgical therapy in 7.8% of 346 cases MEETING PATIENTS' NEEDS A rare paper on the 'motives, needs and expectations' of cancer patients in the Netherlands seeking a second surgical opinion ( J Clin Oncol 21:1492-97) found that motives differ greatly. The authors identified five relevant variables: anxiety disposition, dissatisfaction withthe first specialist, preference for decision participation, need for more information, and hope and expectation that the second opinion would be different from the first. A majority of patients (62%) were identified as having 'internal' motives, relating more to reassurance and certainty, while the remainder had 'external' motives, relating to negative experiences or unfulfilled needs. Given that some full second opinion consultations ar e unnecessar y and put extra strain on health services, they suggest strategies that could avoid them. These could include phone or e-mail consultation with an expert for the 'internal group', and improving communicationsskills - developing pr ofessionals as 'educators and collaborators' - to deal with the increasing information and participation needs of the 'external' patients.Grand Round 16 I CANCER WORLD I JANUARY/FEBRUARY 2007surprise, although as referral centres they also tend to see the more complex cases, which could make discrepantresults more likely. Major centres arealso more likely to have access to newertechniques, such as gene-expressionprofiling, which can provide addition-al information relevant to cancer prog- nosis and treatment. A milestone reported recently is the identification of a gene-expressionsignature for Burkitt lymphoma, whichcan distinguish it from Burkitt-likelymphoma (reported in the New Eng- land Journal of Medicine , 8 June 2006). As Paolo Vigneri, a medical oncologistat the University of Catania in Italy,comments: \"They sound alike and lookalike but are completely different.Diagnosis really requires an experi-enced pathologist, but even some experts in this NEJM study misdiag- nosed it. The therapy for the two is verydifferent, but as an oncologist, if some-one tells you it's Burkitt-like or not -that's it. They are fairly rare, but the problem is that rare diseases are always less rare than you'd like and once you'veencountered one you never forget it.\" Rare cancers are of course more likely to be referred for second opinions,but it is the now routine treatmentsthat may be being ignored that are prob - ably more disturbing for patients. Car-doso does see women who have had amastectomy when they could have hadneo-adjuvant chemotherapy and atumourectomy at a multidisciplinarycentre. She feels some isolated sur - geons may not be referring patients fora second consultation because they maynot believe in neo-adjuvant therapy or could be afraid of losing their impact. Similarly , Schultze in Kiel sees patients who have been told by their urologist that the only treatment on offer is radi- cal prostatectomy for advanced disease,with 20% of men then having a localrecurrence - whereas he says his centrecan offer a combination of externalbeam radiotherapy and brachytherapy,with 97% local tumour control. In Germany, concern about existing guidelines for testicular cancer notbeing adequately followed has led to anew second opinion project that couldalso be rolled out for other tumours(see box, p17). Other countries withfledgling second opinion systemsinclude Denmark, which has an expertpanel for patients and doctors; thehealth insurance is obliged to pay for thetreatment they recommend (see Mas- terpiece, CancerWorld September- October oncology experts' initiativecalled 2ndview (see www.2ndview.se).There also several e-mail based ques-tion resources, especially in the US,such as 'Ask the cancer expert' at www.oncolink.com. WHO GETS WHAT No country appears to have a national sys- tem for managing second opinions for all conditions. Some healthcare insurers in the US have had mandatory require-ments for second opinions on some pro - cedures such as mastectomy andprostatectomy to try and reduce the costof elective surgery and to prevent unnec - essary procedures. Most countries with health insurance systems have formal or informal voluntary second opinion optionsthat are paid for in whole or in part. Insur - ers in the US now promote it as a patientright. So European countries with health insurance systems, such as Germany,will pay for all or some of the cost ofsecond or even third and more opinions, although there does not appear to be a legal right anywhere. Indeed, the UK' s National Health Service explicitly states there is no legal right to a second opin- ion, but \"a healthcare professional willrarely refuse to refer you for one unlessthere is sufficient reason.\" In practice, access to second opin- ions appears to vary widely acrossEurope. The Euro Health ConsumerIndex, produced by Health ConsumerPowerhouse, has graded Europe's healthsystems using three-tier system, andincludes 'right to second opinion fornon-trivial conditions' as one of the cri-teria. At present, it adds Belgium, Esto-nia, Ireland and Latvia to the UK ascountries offering no right; other coun-tries such as Greece, Italy, Spain andSweden only score 'yes, but difficult toWHAT OUR READERS SAY CancerWorld asked readers what they think about second opinions. The r espondents include medical oncologists, radiation oncol - ogists, surgeons, radiologists, cancer nurs-es, pathologists, patient advocates, palliative car e specialists and hospital administrators among others. I81% answer ed 'yes' to the question: should all cancer patients be given access to second opinions? A quarter of those who said 'no' also r uled out any special circumstances for a second opinion. I66% have asked patients if they would like a second opinion. I35% said cancer patients can easily obtain a second opinion in their country;18% said bureaucratic procedures hin- der the process; 16% said their system does not pay for a second opinion. A comparison between Eastern and Western Europe showed similar levels of support for the right to a second opinion (80.8% vs87.5%), but a big difference in easy access, with 54% in the West saying patients always have access in their countr y and 5% saying there is no such access. The equivalent fig- ures for Eastern Europe are 30% and 33%.The remainder indicated access is limited by region, bureaucracy or cost.Grand Round CANCER WORLD I JANUARY/FEBRUARY 2007 I 17pointers on how to take steps to find an alternative consultation. Baird adds that in a system like the UK, where access to healthcare ismainly through a primary care 'gate-keeper' (the general practitioner orGP), referrals to other specialists can take precious time and there is always the danger of vital notes and materialsgetting lost. \"GPs may also only comeacross a few cases and know relativelyfew specialists,\" she says. But as an ex-oncologist herself, she adds that thetwo biggest advances she' s seen in lung cancer in recent years are the growth ofmultidisciplinary teams and the role ofthe lung cancer nurse specialist - thelatter can act as a friendly second opin-ion source, she says. (And in the UK,access due to bad information, bureau- cracy or doctor negativism'. France, Ger- many and the Netherlands are among the countries with the highest rank forsecond opinions (and these countriesalso take the top three slots for con-sumer-friendly healthcare systems across all criteria). F rance and Germany also allow direct patient access to specialists(see www .healthpowerhouse.com). But even in the best countries, access to a second opinion is more orless ad hoc - referral choices are entire - ly up to the first specialist, or can be sought by the patient via their own research or in discussion with their pri - mary care doctor . In a survey of around 150 cancer patients from across Europeconducted at a European CancerPatient Coalition masterclass in 2005, 50% of respondents said that bureau-cracy was the main hindrance to gettinga second opinion in their country. Only 13% said a second opinion was easy to obtain, 16% said it was available onlyfrom certain healthcare providers or in certain regions. Ten percent of patients said second opinions are never reim-bursed in their country. It is no wonder that patient advo- cacy organisations are playing a vitalrole as information brokers in theprocess. As Jesme Baird, medical direc-tor at the UK's Roy Castle Lung Can-cer Foundation, comments, \"Patientsuse us like a second opinion - they calland say , 'Here' s my stage of disease, and this is what my doctor says; does this sound right?' All we can say is that itmay be broadly right or wrong.\" How - ever, the copious information nowavailable on advocacy and canceragency sites gives patients plenty ofpersonal breast cancer information is available by e-mail from nurses at www.breastcancercare.org.uk). How- ever, even in a big centre Baird says alloptions may not be explored orexplained - in the UK, in particular,patients may not be told about a drug that is not funded and not in the hos - pital formulary. Vinod Joshi, a restorative dental specialist who runs the Mouth CancerFoundation, another patient group inthe UK, says meeting other patients,even in an online forum, can be an important second opinion resource. \"They can come to us without feelingthey are jeopardising the treatmentthey have been offered,\" he says. Thefear that many have about 'upsetting' \"Pathologists are more advanced than clinicians in asking for second opinions among themselves\" SECOND OPINION PROJECT A project in Germany is aiming to iron out the differences in outcomes for testicular cancer that ar e still being seen despite long-established standard care guidelines. A network of 20 second-opinion centres has been established by the German Testicular Cancer Study Group in conjunction with a health insurer. The centres receive patient data and the treatment sug-gestion from the original doctor, and then recommend therapy according to evidence-basedguidelines. The project will follow up patients after two years; it will focus on recurrence-free survival data and will compare intended, recommended and actual therapy. Mark Schrader, assistant medical director in the oncology unit at Berlin's Charit\u00e9 hospi- tal, is coordinating the data management. \"The problem with guidelines is that no one reads them,\" he says. \"We have seen a lot of issues, particularly in some regions and small towns, with diagnostic work-up, therapy and surgery. Now patients and doctors have an easy wayto consult specialists at multidisciplinary centres. It is all done by software and e-mail.\" Some 200 referrals have already been made. The pr oject has not been without pr oblems. \"The health insur er is so far only paying for five of the centres, the others are doing it for free,\" says Schrader. \"But the main problem is the urologists - they are worried that other experts will get all their best patients and they will earnless money .\" The head of the Ger man Urological Association has been particularly critical, adds Schrader. \"There has been an unbelievable amount of tension on this project,\" he says. Grand Round 18 I CANCER WORLD I JANUARY/FEBRUARY 2007their doctor should not be underesti - mated; Baird makes the point thatunless actively encouraged, people canbe very reluctant to seek another opin - ion. Joshi notes that it is not easy in theUK to be referred to a multidisciplinarycentre outside of a patient' s home region, or for patients to discover thattreatment modalities may differ fairlysubtly , say in the radiation fractions given. \"These decisions can be affect-ed by finance,\" he comments. He alsofeels strongly that oncologists should be open about drug treatments that are not funded in one area - such ascetuximab, which is available for head and neck cancer in Scotland but not yet in England. \"It is better than notsaying anything about it at all.\" From the oncologist's perspective, Vigneri notes that patients need to bearresponsibility too. \"I have no problemwith people seeking alternative opin-ions, but some go to places that are notwell qualified and get answers theylike better.\" The sheer volume of workthat referrals can generate is also anobstacle. \"Doctors need to prepare an extensive letter detailing the clinical sit-uation of the patient. This materialalso needs to be translated into English and coupled with copies of the neces- sary laboratory and radiological examscarried out to evaluate the patient.\" If they do go to a centre that is not highly qualified and internationallyrecognised, \"the end result might beconfusing, unreliable advice with con-sequent conflicts between the patient,their family, and the different oncolo- gists involved.\" Vigneri has also come across patients who have had surgeryand, told they also need chemotherapy, delay treatment too long while they 'shop around'. Another concern he has is when patients fail to seek a second opinionbefore enrolling on clinical trials, andthen drop out. \"This can be a hugewaste of time for an oncologist.\" QUALITY OF LIFE Schultze at Kiel feels that a key issue that patients don' t ask about enough isthe consequences of treatment and quality of life. \"These questions arenot raised much by patients,\" he says.\"For example, prostate cancer is presently a problem, as we are in aphase where we have to make up ourmind if someone needs treatment atall, and if so, what treatment to give.And we need to encourage more sec - ond opinions on quality of life in pal - liative care for conditions such asinoperable lung tumours and head andneck cancers where you can apply very harmful, aggressive treatments, but at what price? \"Doctors often decide on a course of treatment easily, but we do not see the burden we are bringing to thepatient - for us it is our surgery, for thepatient it is the rest of his life.\" It is a point strongly endorsed by Joshi. \"Rehabilitation is an area that isnot sufficiently addressed,\" he says, not-ing that, unlike some other cancer treat-ments, surgery for mouth cancer can besocially disfiguring and can create greatfunctional difficulties. Surgeons, he The fear that many have about 'upsetting' their doctor should not be underestimatedSearching for certainty.Websites like these offer varying levels of information,including extensive lists of FAQs, e-mailresponse services and even contacts for telephone or full face-to-face consultationsGrand Round CANCER WORLD I JANUARY/FEBRUARY 2007 I 19says, may opt to perform a procedure that is more comfortable for them than the patient, and there are major choic- es that can be made - such as restoringa hole in the mouth with a prosthesis, orsurgically, which can make other restora-tive work much harder. \"Part of getting a second opinion should include speaking to a patientwho has had that treatment and becomforted that people do get through itdespite the disabilities. Suppose youhave surgery to your mouth, and thesurgeon says you should have a feeding tube to your stomach. Some people fear this additional treatment - the secondopinion they need is from anotherpatient who may tell them that withoutit you can' t eat, you lose weight and it' s the only thing that kept them alive.\" A second opinion could also extend to others specialists who are often notpart of the 'loop' in the early days of treatment, such as gastroenterologists, who may be able to provide informationon the chances of radiation damage to the bowel and subsequent lifestyle issues. Even if there is no alternativetreatment, there could then be conti-nuity of care for a patient group thatcurrently receives little attention. Like many issues in cancer, much opportunity lies in the multidisciplinaryteam. Paolo Vigneri says it is notuncommon where he works now inSicily to be visited by patients whohave had surgery and had no discussionwith a medical oncologist beforehand.Having recently also worked atBellinzona in Switzerland, which hasmultidisciplinary tumour boards, hehas seen the value of patients meetingboth parties prior to any procedure. One of the strongest appeals for an auto- matic second opinion comes from the R.A. Bloch Cancer Foundation in the US, founded by Robert Bloch, who sur-vived a terminal diagnosis of lung cancerand went on to live for another 26 years.One day, he was with a medical oncolo- gist who said that he had never in his career treated a cancer patient without asecond opinion, because being onlyhuman, he could make a mistake - andthere is often no second chance. \"Myconclusion is that any doctor treating acancer patient without a second opinion is not practising medicine, but trying to play God,\" says Bloch on the site. Recognising the importance of mul - tidisciplinary decision making, Bloch'sfoundation has pushed for patients to bepresent when their cases are discussedby such teams - to take forward thethoughts of ex-US Supreme Court judge and breast cancer survivor Sandra Day O'Connor in a speech to the National Coalition for Cancer Survivorship backin 1994. \"Let me tell you my dream... tohave a consultation with all the expertsavailable at the same time, who've already looked at these things, they've looked at everything, and they are all inthe same room, and they are there tohelp you reach a decision.\" Dream may be, but the Bloch site has a list of about 100 institutions inthe US that say they will provide a multidisciplinary second opinion 'where doctors representing each dis - cipline which could treat the patient' s cancer meet together at the same timewith the patient.' Now that is a gold standard to aspire to. \"For us it is our surgery, for the patient it is the rest of his life\" IN SHORT IWomen, especially breast cancer patients, are among the most likely to seek second opinions, probably because of the many different treatment options for breast cancerand its high visibility in the media. IComputers networks are obvious second opinion enablers. The European Union's e-Health action plan predicts that by 2008 the majority of European health organisations should have the technical capability to provide online teleconsultation services for second opin-ions and other needs. IMore than a quarter (29%) of US adults reported that they or a member of their family received a second medical opinion from a doctor in the past five years, according to a2005 Harris Interactive survey. In 30% of these, the diagnosis differed from the original. Another Harris poll in 2006 found that 36% of US adults never get a second opinion and nearly one in ten (9%) 'rar ely or never understand' their diagnosis. IAustralian researchers have found that 'Googling' symptoms on the Internet came up with the right diagnosis in 15 out of 26 cases (reported in the New England Journal of Medi- cine). At Duke University in the US, medical physicists ar e using a Google-like appr oach to compare mammograms with the most highly ranked images returned from a database.DrugWatch 22 ICANCER WORLD IJANUARY/FEBRUARY new system for fast-tracking drugs aims to offer quicker access to promising new therapies without jeopardising essential research. Draft Guidance on the use ofthe new conditional marketing approval procedure will shortly be published, andpatients, professionals and the public are being invited to have their say.How will EMEA use its new powers of conditional marketing authorisation? In July, the European Medi- cines Agency (EMEA) threw a possible lifeline to two groupsof patients who have reachedthe end of the road with con - ventional drug treatment. EMEA gave conditional approval forthe use of sunitinib malate (Sutent) forpatients with advanced and/or metasta- tic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) where interferon alfa and interleukin-2 therapies have failed. It also granted conditional approval for its use in patients with unresectable and/ormetastatic malignant gastrointestinalstromal tumour (GIST) where ima-tinib mesylate treatment has failed dueto resistance or intolerance. For these patients, the early approval of sunitinib gives some newhope. For everyone with an interest innew therapeutics - as patients, public,health providers or drug developers -this represents the first chance to seehow EMEA, which has responsibilityfor approving all new cancer medi - cines, intends to use its new powers togrant conditional marketing authori-sation (CMA).The concept of CMA was adopted by the EU in 2004 \"in order to meet, inparticular , the legitimate expectations of patients and to take account of theincreasingly rapid progress of scienceand therapies.\" Pressure had beengrowing from European patients withcancer and other life-threatening dis - eases who could not understand why they should wait months or years longer than patients in the US for access todrugs that could save, prolong or improve their lives. There was also a perceived need to update the regulatory procedure to takeaccount of the way drug developmenthas been transformed by progress inmolecular imaging. The early stages oftraditional drug development (pre-clinical,phase I and phase II) tested whether thedrug was safe and effective enough to beworth trying in a large confirmatory(phase III) clinical trial. The regulatoryprocedure therefore focused on theoutcome of the phase III trials. Now researchers are able to see more about what is happening at molecularlevel, and the early stages have becomea fount of information. Researchers canexplore how the drug works, what targets it is hitting, which patients have the tar - get and what dose and schedule shouldbe most effective. The new procedure, modelled in part on the US 'accelerated approval'procedure, gives EMEA two new pow-ers. The first is to approve drugs for aone-year period, renewable annually, as soon as sponsors show data strong enough to demonstrate a positivebenefit-risk balance. This has the potential to reduce the period between a drug going into development and themarketing application being handedto EMEA. (The time EMEA spendsassessing the drug, is dealt with by aseparate regulation on 'acceleratedassessment'.) The second is the powerto lay down conditions with some legalstanding requiring the sponsors to carryout post-approval studies to clarify cer-tain aspects of the drug - duration ofeffect, which patients it works best in,what is the optimum dosage, and so on. The CMA procedure is expected to be widely used for new cancer drugs. Inparticular, it is likely to be used fordrugs that would previously have beenDrugWatch CANCER WORLD I JANUARY/FEBRUARY 2007 I 23It is equally vague about what EMEA can ask for in post-approval studies.The regulation mentions only that theholder of a CMA shall be required tocomplete ongoing studies, or to con - duct new studies, with a view to con-firming that the risk-benefit balanceis positive and providing the compre - hensive clinical data referring to safe-ty and efficacy that would normallybe required for standard approval.dealt with under 'exceptional circum- stances' approvals procedure, for whichthe criteria are more restrictive. The implementation regulation (507/2006), which came into force inApril 2006, spells out the type of drugsthat may be eligible for CMA (see box).It also spells out the basis on whichconditional marketing approval can berenewed after the approval year is over. However , the regulation is remark -ably vague when it comes to criteria on which approval should be granted. Thefirst criterion listed under Article 4 sayssimply that \"The risk-benefit balance asdefined in Article 1(28a) of Directive 2001/83/EC is positive,\" that is, anyrisk relating to the quality, safety or effi-cacy of the product as regards patients'health or public health. There is notthe merest hint of direction about howrisks or benefits should be measured.THE CMA REGULATION Eligible therapies (article 2) IMedicinal products aimed at treatment, prevention or diagnosis of seriouslydebilitating or life-threatening diseases IMedicinal products to be used in response to public health emergencies I'Orphan' medicinal products for rare diseases Requirements (article 4) IPositive risk-benefit balance IApplicant 'likely' to be able to data post-appr oval IMeets unmet needs IEarly appr oval of benefit to public health on balance Renewal (article 6) IAnnual r enewal IRisk-benefit balance to be confir med, meeting CMA obligations CMA versus Exceptional Cir cumstances Approval under exceptional circumstance can only be applied to dr ugs wher e it is deemed impossible ever to collect com - prehensive data due to rarity or because itis contrar y to medical ethics, or the state of scientific knowledge does not allow such data to be collected.

Decisions on which new drugs will make it to the EU market and which won't are made here at EMEA's headquarters in Canary Wharf, LondonDrugWatch 24 I CANCER WORLD I JANUARY/FEBRUARY 2007Collection of further pharmacovigi- lance data can also be required. Quite how this will translate into practice, and the implications for can-cer patients, drug developers, andhealth providers, depend heavily onhow these broad-brush requirementsare interpreted. Will there have to be data from a randomised trial? Will the new thera-py need to be compared against bestcare or a placebo? Could it be enoughjust to show the response in a single- arm trial? W ill drug sponsors have to show which target is being hit, andidentify the group of patients who aremost likely to respond? How manypatients will be required for data onefficacy or safety? W ill the drug need to show clinical benefit on survival or symptoms? If 'surrogate endpoints' are used (see box), what level of cer - tainty will be required to show that thesurrogate is reasonably likely to pre-dict clinical benefit? There are also questions about post- approval study requirements. Whatsort of studies will be asked for , and what will happen if a drug sponsor does not fully comply? Will CMA be withdrawn if the post-approval obliga - tions are not fulfilled? Three main stakeholder groups will be affected by the way EMEA addresses these questions: patients who have runout of other options, drug developers,and the general public. THE PATIENT - A LIFELINE What matters to patients is access to effective drugs as quickly as possible, through 'conditional' approval or anyother route, such as participation inclinical trials or compassionate useprogrammes. Safety is not the primary issue for many of them, who are facing the prospect of death or a very impairedquality of life anyway . They would probably set the risk-benefit hurdlefairly low. This translates into acceptingless demanding trial designs, and allow - ing benefit to be measured in terms, for instance, of tumour shrinkage, which tends to be quicker to measure, butmay not accurately reflect true or sus - tained benefit in terms of survival orquality of life. Precise identification of the target group will not be a major priority. If thedata indicate that the drug is effectivein one in ten patients with a given indi- cation, most patients would at least like the option of 'giving it a go', par - ticularly if side-effects appear encour-aging. Patients are likely to be very supportive of any studies that could throw further light on how and inwhom the drug in question works best- but not at the cost of delaying access. THE INDUSTRY - QUICKER RETURNS The second group of stakeholders are the sponsors of experimental drugs,principally pharmaceutical companies.Kapil Dhingra, vice president of theoncology division at Roche, speaking at the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) last October, wel-comed the new approval, and said theapproval of sunitinib was \"a good start\".He characterised the main advantagesfor the industry as early certainty abouta drug' s launch, and early return on investment. The July 2005 issue of Regulatory Rapporteur said that early approval may be particularly important for biotechcompanies, which play a key role indeveloping molecularly targeted ther - apies but don't always have theresources to conduct long and expen - sive phase III trials. Financially, then, this would be a good deal for the industry , good for shareholders, and good for the rest of us if lower costs stimulate innovative research or result in lower prices andmore thorough research into new drugs. From the developer's point of view, the guiding principle on approval is'the earlier the better'. In general, theywill be looking for the number ofpatients and the length of timerequired to prove efficacy and safety tobe set somewhere at the lower end ofthe scale, and they will want EMEA toadopt less rigorous measures of effica-cy. Rather than having to show sur-vival data, which can take a long timeto collect, the industry would preferCMA to be granted on data aboutresponse rate (tumour shrinkage), timeSURROGATE ENDPOINTS Surrogate endpoints are measurable variables deemed likely to predict clinically meaning- ful endpoints such as longer survival or reduced symptoms. They can be quicker to evalu- ate than clinical endpoints, but their predictive powers are not very accurate. CMA is likely to rely heavily on data from surrogate endpoints, with the option of requesting post-approval studies to see how this translates to clinical endpoints. Traditionally, a limited group of surrogate markers have been accepted on a case-by-case basis, including r esponse rate (tumour shrinkage) and time to pr ogression or progression- free survival. These may, in the future, be extended to include functional imaging, such as measures of apoptosis/antiproliferative effects, and also pharmocodynamic biomarkers suchas PSA as a marker for pr ostate cancer or CA 125 for ovarian cancer . However, statistical validation of these sorts of surrogate biomarkers is proving very difficult.DrugWatch CANCER WORLD I JANUARY/FEBRUARY 2007 I 25to progression (how long the drug keeps the disease at bay), functional imaging (imaging levels of cell death or cell proliferation) or biological markersof efficacy. The industry also has a view on post-approval studies. Once a new drug as been approved, pharmaceutical companies will want to move on. Theyhave little interest in tying up resourcesin research that may offer little finan - cial benefit and may even diminish themarket as research identifies whichsubgroups of patients respond best. There are also ethical and logistical problems to conducting such studies aftera drug has reached the market. P atients often join a trial of an experimental drugin the hope of being randomised toreceive the new treatment. Once thedrug is on the market, joining a ran-domised trial actually decreases theirchances of getting the drug which they could otherwise have on prescription. At the ESMO meeting, Dhingra stressed the need to have a very clear definition of the clinical objectives, scope and timelines for post-approvalstudies, and said that EMEA needed totake account of what was feasible. THE PUBLIC - EFFECTIVE TREATMENT As a third stakeholder, what the general public wants amounts to efficacy andefficiency. As potential patients, theywant a system that encourages drugdevelopers to find effective therapiestargeted precisely at the specific malig-nant phenotype driving the cancer . They want the treatments that can bedelivered in the most effective sched-ule, dose, combination, and method ofadministration, and they don't want to take therapies that might be of no ben- efit for their particular disease, but might have nasty side-effects. As tax, medical insurance or treat- ment payers, the public does not wantto foot the bill for prescribing an increasing number of highly expensive drugs to broad populations of patientsif only a minority are likely to benefit,and if clinicians do not have the infor - mation to use them to greatest effect. A group of researchers at the Mario Negri Pharmacology Research Institute, in Milan, argue that EMEA and its US counterpart, the FDA, have \"a major rolein improving public health, as they fallbetween clinical trials and (public) healthcare\" and that \"drugs must be rapidlyreleased for patients who need them,but not at the expense of adequate knowl-edge about the benefit of the drugs.\" Their paper, published in the British Journal of Cancer (vol 93, pp504-509), analyses the basis on which EMEA hasapproved drugs for solid cancers over the 10 years since centralised marketing was introduced in 1995, and argues forraising the standard of proof, particular-ly for clinical benefit. Looking only at applications for new drugs or for extended indicationsfor therapies for solid tumours, theypoint out that response rate (usuallygiven as the percentage of patientswhose tumours shrunk by at least50%) was used as the primary basis forgranting 30 out of 48 approvals, butthat, in cases where data were avail-able, this translated very poorly intosurvival benefit. In 13 cases for whichsurvival data were also given, the ben-efit ranged from 0 to 3.7 months, withmean and median benefit of 1.5 and 1.2 months. The authors also point out that 30% of approvals were given on the basis ofsingle-arm trials, despite the advice inEMEA's own Note for Guidance 'Eval-uation of anticancer medicinal prod- ucts in man' (2002). This says that randomised comparative trials are nor-mally always required, with no com - parative trials being consideredacceptable only in the case of pre-treated patients when no establishedregimens exist. In the US, more than 90% of post- approval study commitments remainedunfulfilled according to a 2005 FDAreport. The Mario Negri researchersconclude that the public interest isbest served by keeping the efficacyhurdle higher, rather than relying onpost-approval studies to come up withmore robust data. They argue that EMEA should insist on seeing overall survival data in combi - nation with formal assessments of symp- tom control or quality of life. These assume greater significance given therather small median survival benefit of1.2 months offered by drugs for solidtumours approved over the past 10 years. On the question of trial design, they make the case that there shouldbe a requirement for phase II ran-domised trials, with patients ran-domised to the new drug or to bestavailable care. They also argue thatphase III comparative trials should bethe norm for the approval of new anti-cancer drugs, with phase II studiesonly accepted in exceptional cases,when there is really outstanding,unprecedented or unexpected activity .Response rate was the basis for 30 out of 48 approvals, but this translated very poorly into survival benefitDrugWatch 26 I CANCER WORLD I JANUARY/FEBRUARY 2007seeking approval for a targeted drug should not expect to get approval for its use in an unselected population. A key paper published in the New England Journal of Medicine two years ago (Roberts and Chabner, vol 351,pp501-505) argued that it may be unrealistic to expect pharmaceutical companies to carry out these studies,as they can be very complex, time-consuming and are likely , at least in the short term, to diminish the market fortheir drugs. For the US, they proposed a mecha - nism for 'selective approval' wherebyearly approval could be granted, \"only ifthe sponsor has initiated studies to iden - tify subgroups of patients who are likelyto have responses.\" The regulators anddrug sponsors would reach agreementover how the studies could be conclud-ed, with an option of forming a partner - ship with a public body such as the US National Cancer Institute or an aca- demic centre, with a certain percentageof profits from the early marketing of the drug set aside to fund this research. Sadly, Europe has no equivalent of the NCI. However, there are manyinternational cooperative groups, aswell as the European Organisation forResearch and Treatment of Cancer orthe French National Cancer Institute,INCa, which recently launched a post-approval trial (PHARE) to find outmore about the best way to use adju-vant trastuzumab (Herceptin). THE VIEW FROM EMEA Faced with these potentially conflicting pressures from patients with unmetneed, from the industry and from thepublic interest, how is EMEA going toTo ensure that the regulatory process takes into account the needs of patients for whom experimental drugs may be their only hope, the researcherssuggest greater patient involvement inthe EMEA evaluation process to helpidentify which drugs really need fast- track designation. They also emphasise the importance of effective informationto spell out to patients the risks of a par - tially proven therapy . SELECTIVE APPROV AL Current understanding about the com - plexity of cancer and of mechanisms ofaction and of resistance to drugs sug - gests that the disappointing clinical ben - efit shown by many drugs in the abovestudy may indicate not that the drugs areineffective, but that they are effective inonly a small part of the population theywere tested in. The worry is that thegreat promise of the era of individually targeted treatments may never be realised if therapies are marketed early , with insufficient information about selection of the target group, especially if nobody takes responsibility for thenecessary post-approval work. The experience with gefitinib (Iressa) for non-small-cell cancer isoften cited to illustrate the problems.Rejected by EMEA because of lack ofsurvival impact in an unselected popu-lation, the drug has since been found tobe effective in a certain very specificsubgroup. Makers AstraZeneca claim it would have been almost impossible toidentify this target group had the drugnot been on the market, and thus wide - ly used, in the US and Japan. Manyvoices from the national regulatory agen-cies, however , believe that companiesimplement the CMA regulation? So far, the approval of sunitinib is all that anyone has to go on, because EMEA is still in the process of drawing up draftNotes for Guidance. However,Francesco Pignatti, Scientific Admin-istrator at EMEA, agreed to share his personal views with CancerW orld. Pignatti stresses that CMA requires proof of a positive risk-benefit bal - ance. \"Some people understand CMAas putting drugs on the market withoutknowing their efficacy , and that is not what is meant by conditional approval. I think that even for CMA it is crucial that a drug is only ever put on the mar - ket when EMEA 's scientific committee has judged that, based on the evidenceavailable, the benefit-risk balance ispositive The draft of the regulationstarted off saying the benefit-risk is'presumed positive'. Now that wordhas gone from the final legislation.\" He accepts, however, that, despite being as objective as possible, assessingthe risk-benefit balance is not an exact science. \"One needs to express value judgements on multidimen-sional concepts - benefits, risks -each estimated with variable degreesof uncertainty. Without comprehen-sive clinical data, as for CMA, thereal challenge is to identify situationswhere it is still possible to conclude ona positive benefit-risk balance.\" Given the subjective nature of the judgement, patients will need to havea strong voice in the regulatory processto ensure their voice is heard. Tradi-tionally , Europe has lagged far behind the US in this respect, but EMEAhas been trying hard to catch up. AWorking Group with P atients andEMEA is moving away from the 'gatekeeper' model towards more constructive communicationDrugWatch CANCER WORLD I JANUARY/FEBRUARY 2007 I 27Consumers Organisations now enables these groups to have a formal consul- tative role. Though for some patientsthis falls far short of the partnershipthey would like, the European CancerPatient Coalition and other patientgroups have welcomed the move. Pignatti sees a cultural shift away from the 'gatekeeper' model towards a constructive communication amongstakeholders more appropriate totoday's rapid progress of basic scienceand cancer therapies. \"In this context, CMA makes a lot of sense - it weighs the need for a comprehensive clinicaldevelopment with high unmet needand public health interest in gettingbeneficial drugs quickly to patients indesperate need.\" Pignatti envisages the use of surro - so long as they are con-sidered \"reasonably likely\" to predict aneffect on a clinical endpoint such assurvival, and so long as the effect on thesurrogate is great enough. \"There aresome surrogates where the predictionis sufficiently high that if the effect isbig enough, and looking at all the sup - portive evidence, you know that it will be very likely also to mean something in terms of clinical benefit.\" MINIMUM DATA SETS Asked about what he would envisage to be the minimum specifications interms of trial size and design requiredto grant approval, Pignatti said, \"It isnot about the minimum. It is about giv-ing yourself the chance in a compre-hensive development of deciding atwhich point there could be sufficientevidence to go for approval.\" He is cautious about spelling things out in detail, because there are so manypossible variables: the rarity of the indi-cation, the level of toxicity , whether alternative therapies are currently avail-able, whether the drug shows dramaticor less-pronounced activity and so on.He recognises, however, that the win- dow of opportunity for performing a randomised study in a certain indicationmay only exist before approval, and heventures some general comments. \"To aim for early approval, one should randomise early in the clinicaldevelopment. Preference should be given to study designs and endpoints that can capture convincingly a clinicalbenefit as early as possible. In the stan-dard approach we would certainly say'do a randomised trial, and if appropri-ate plan for an interim analysis when you have a sufficient number of patients when it is meaningful to drawsome conclusions, in case the treat-ment effect is much larger than initiallyexpected.' \"I would not recommend a strategy focussing on single-arm studies for approval. However, if one happens to observe a dramatic effect in a single-armstudy, it may be that randomised trialsare no longer needed. But this shouldbe the exception, and there may be THE SUNITINIB PRECEDENT Sunitinib is the only dr ug so far appr oved by CMA. Trial design The demonstration of ef ficacy in patients with metastatic r enal cell car cinoma (mRCC) who were refractory to prior cytokine therapy with interleukin-2 or interferon was based on the proportion of patients achieving an objective response observed in two single-arm studies. The studies wer e conducted in a homogenous gr oup of pr ogressive patients with a pr edictable outcome of the disease. Results The estimated pr oportion of r esponders was EMEA's opinion EMEA 's Committee for the Evaluation of Human Medicinal Pr oducts (CHMP) consider ed the effect in terms of tumour shrinkage to be unprecedented, even with the most active available agents in a non-refractory population for which response rates in the order of 5 to 15% have been r eported. They found that the efficacy results provided sufficient confidence to believe that treatment with sunitinib would translate into some effect in terms of progression-free sur- vival or overall survival in patients who have failed prior cytokine-based treatment, althoughthey were unable to assess the exact size of the effect on these clinical endpoints. Post-approval studies At the time of approval, the CHMP considered that data from an ongoing randomised trial of sunitinib as a first-line treatment in mRCC patients could help to confirm that treatmentwith the drug is associated with an effect on important clinical endpoints. Although the ongoing trial involved an active control and patients in an earlier stage of treatment, based on pharmacological and biological grounds, the demonstration of a favourable effect as afirst-line treatment would be considered relevant also for patients with mRCC who have failed prior cytokine-based treatment. This would confirm the existence of an effect in terms of rel- evant clinical endpoints even if the pr ecise magnitude of this ef fect would not be known. Upgrading to full approval The randomised trial has now been completed and in October EMEA's Committee for Med- icinal Pr oducts for Human Use r ecommended that sunitinib's CMA should be upgraded to full approval, with the approval being extended to cover first-line use in mRCC patients.DrugWatch 28 I CANCER WORLD I JANUARY/FEBRUARY 2007different perceptions about what con- stitutes a 'dramatic' effect. Indeed in our experience, lack of an adequately randomised controlled trial has beenan important reason for rejection.\" A look at EMEA's track record, however, shows that 16 (44%) of the 38 oncology new drug applications that were granted marketing authori-sation in the last 10 years wereapproved on the basis of single-armtrials, and Pignatti acknowledges thatthis is an issue of concern in somequarters. In the case of sunitinib, approval was based on the results of two single-arm trials. There were, however , early supportive data from an ongoing ran-domised trial in a different category ofpatients. Completion of that ran - domised trial was one of the condi-tions EMEA set for giving sunitinibconditional marketing approval. A POWERFUL TOOL The power to set these sorts of condi- tions is something new for EMEA. How that power will be used is one ofthe big question marks relating to thenew approval procedure. Pignatti points to the second cri- terion under the Requirements sec-tion of the implementation regulation,that it must be \"likely that the appli-cant will be in a position to provide thecomprehensive clinical data,\" (post-approval), and he argues that gettingagreement with the drug sponsorsover what studies are feasible andappropriate will be key to overcomingcompliance problems. He is clear that there will be strict limits to what post-approval studiesare asked for. \"You shouldn't be impos- ing more requirements than neces- sary. So if for instance we have a drug that works in refractory disease, andthen we are interested in knowingwhether it would also work early on,that should not really be a CMA type of question. But if we have some uncertainty in the indication in whichit is currently approved, and we thinkwe could extrapolate information froman earlier indication to reduce thatuncertainty , then we can ask that question.\" This is what was done in the case of sunitinib (see box, p27). Regulations are being drafted that will allow EMEA to impose fines fornon-compliance. Doubts have beenexpressed in some quarters overwhether financial penalties are anappropriate way to deal with issueslike clinical trials, and time will tell how much use EMEA will make of these powers. Pignatti is clear , how- ever, that although approval is condi- tional on the required studies being carried out, no drug approved viaCMA (i.e. positive benefit-risk hadbeen established) would be with-drawn from the market purely becausethe conditions were not fulfilled. The key, he believes, is to ensure that patients and prescribers under-stand the implications if a therapythey are using has conditional ratherthan full marketing authorisation. In the case of is more evidence tocome about this medicine, in partic-ular in the treatment of kidney cancer .Sutent [sunitinib] has shown to shrink the tumour. However, more informa- tion is awaited on the duration of this effect. The European MedicinesAgency (EMEA) will review newinformation on the medicine everyyear and this leaflet will be updated as necessary .\" Pignatti believes that this kind of clear information to physicians andpatients will be an incentive for com - panies to finish the required post-approval studies to upgrade tostandard approval. Is it realistic to rely on clear com- munications to make the regulatorysystem work, or will EMEA 's voice be drowned out by the heavy guns ofpharma advertising, at least amongthe non-specialists who are stillresponsible for prescribing cancerdrugs in many parts of Europe?Should CMA be used sparingly to avoid non-compliance, and if so, what of the patients who need quickaccess to new therapies? Once posi- tive risk-benefit has been proved to the standard required for CMA, hasEMEA any business demanding anyfurther data? But if they don't, thenwho has responsibility for carryingout the trials needed to find out howbest to use the drugs and in whom? Clinicians, patients, health admin- istrators, policy makers and membersof the public who have an interest inthe new drug approval regulationsshould look out for the draft Notes forGuidance document scheduled to bepublished on the EMEA websitewww.emea.eu.int. It will be a consul-tation document, and EMEA wantsyour views. No drug approved via CMA would be withdrawn purely because the conditions were not fulfilledBestReporter 30 ICANCER WORLD IJANUARY/FEBRUARY 2007From plan to practice The French Cancer plan of 2003 raised expectations among the public and patients.This article, which looks at how a key measure is being implemented in practice, was one of severalstories that earned Paul Benkimoun recognition in the 2006 ESO Best Reporter Awards. Bad news will always be bad news, but the way it is told makes a big difference. Throughout the year, some 37 pilotschemes running in 58 institutions havebeen trying out a novel way of breaking the news of a cancer diagnosis that was developedin conjunction with patients. It aims to improve theconditions under which patients are notified of their condition and told about the treatment they will be given. As the pilots started gradually , full results are yet to be obtained. And the pilotschemes are set to be extended to allthe sites treating cancer during thesecond half of the year. In 1999, the White Book of the National Anti-Cancer League car- ried testimonies from people who were disgusted by the off-hand orbrutal manner with which they were told of their illness. A symbol of the battle of patients, the improvement of the conditionsunder which news of the diagnosis is notified, wasnumber 40 in a list of 70 measures of the CancerPlan, launched in March 2003 by [President]Jacques Chirac. A budget of 3.2 million euros was allocated, amongst other things, to pay for the creation of newnursing jobs. Another 15 million euros were set asideto extend the scheme in 2005, a sum that will haveto be revised in 2006. The project was geared up toinclude 25,000 to 30,000 patients throughout theyear. Ten months into the trial, some 15,000 peoplehave taken part in the system, which is piloted by theNational Cancer Institute in tandem with theNational Anti-Cancer League and the Directorate of Hospitalisation and Care Management. \"YOUDON'TKNOW ANYTHING \" The trial relates to the notification of the diagno - sis, or its confirmation, but also to \"the proposalfor a treatment plan\" decided at a multidiscipli - nary meeting, and to \"the provision of a team of carers\" including a psychologist and a social worker , as laid down in the specifications. Patients can find familiar con- tacts within the system, and in thecase of the reporting nurse, some - body who is more accessible than adoctor . \"The consultation with the nurse is a sort of 'emotional catharsis'for the patient and a time when medicalterms will be translated into less aca- demic language than is used by a doctor,\" said Professor Henri Pujol, president of theNational Anti-Cancer League. \"We feel physically,and also intellectually, diminished. We don't knowanything when faced with the doctor, the one whoknows,\" commented Henri Gontier, a memberof the patients' committee at the Institut Paoli-Calmettes (IPC) in Marseilles. \"In the case of tumours whose location is highly symbolic, such as the brain, you cannot justsay straight out: You have a brain tumour ,\" explains Dr Olivier Chinot, of the neuro-oncology unit at the Timone University Hospital, in Marseilles, whois highly involved with paramedical staff in thesetrials. \"Often patients do not ask the prognosis.\" This article was first published in Le Monde , 20 April 2005, and is reprinted with permission BestReporter CANCER WORLD I JANUARY/FEBRUARY 2007 I 31Watchdog. Articles like this, which explore how far commitments to cancer patients are actually being translatedinto better services for all, put pressure on health services to deliver, and let patients and their families know what they have the right to expect \"They or their family ask us,\" elaborates Soazic Duval, a nurse in the same department. \"Bearing in mind the loss of independence that results frombrain cancer , we have to take into account from the start the friends and family of these patients, whoare often young,\" adds Bruno Tivoli, the hospitalexecutive who implemented the new system at laTimone teaching hospital. Patients are also more likely to speak to the nurse about matters deemed 'delicate', or too banalto raise with the doctor . It is at this point that many patients discover that, in addition to causing themto lose hair from their head, chemotherapy oftencauses the loss of pubic hair . The matter of wigs is frequently broached. As a by-product of these pilot schemes on the notification of cancer diagnoses, doctors have learned the value of information gathered by paramedic staff. \"W e had not sufficiently questioned the ambu- lance drivers, who take patients home, about the sickness caused by chemotherapy,\" acknowledges Dr Jacques Camerlo, trial coordinator at the IPC. \"A TURNING POINT \" A notification system also calls for a rapproche- ment between hospital doctors and their colleagues on the outside. The general practitioner (GP) is, infact, involved in informing the patient of the diag-nosis. \"A general practitioner from Marseilles toldme: 'When I refer patient to the Institut Paoli-Cal-mettes [specialist cancer centre], don' t you think that I have held a patient notification consulta-tion?',\" says Dr Camerlo. \"The GP needs to beinformed very quickly ,\" urges Dr Christine Bara, from the National Cancer Institute, who statesthat three-quarters of patients go to see their GPimmediately after the notification consultation.The pilots of the project know that making the scheme universal will not be simple. Even in Mar - seilles, often cited as an exemplary case, things havenot always been simple. \"Some doctors from la T im- one University Hospital have had the honesty to saythat they did not want to take part. Some give theiragreement, but only send us one follow-up sheet permonth,\" says Professor Pierre-Henri Juin, who has been coordinating the experiment there for a year. It is clear that there is a need \"to proceed gen - tly and with flexibility\", as Christine Bara says. \"It isa question of a qualitative approach. We must avoida purely administrative application of the system,\"she adds. If you try to act on the frequent requestfrom patients that notification consultations shouldno longer be held on F riday, leaving them on their own throughout the weekend, then you will prob- ably have to take into account the problem of avail- ability of doctors. Flexibility is required, but also determination. \"Patients have worked on this for four or five years. Therefore they are expecting changes. This will bea turning point in the relations between doctors andpatients,\" predicts Professor Pujol. He agrees withDr Bara that further consideration needs to begiven to four areas: paramedical consultation, theinteraction between the local community and thehospital, the identification of psychological andsocial needs, and the personalised treatment plan. Some practitioners look further ahead. \"We will undoubtedly have to come up with an end-of-treat - ment system, as patients often collapse psycholog-ically when they are no longer cared for as closely asduring the treatment stage,\" observes ProfessorDominique Maraninchi, director of the IPC andchairman of the science board of the National Anti-Cancer Institute. BestReporter 32 I CANCER WORLD I JANUARY/FEBRUARY 2007Marie-No\u00eblle, 48 years of age, operated on in February: \"What are my chances?\" She knew it as she pushed open the door to her GP's office. In fact, she knew it when she felt a lump as she examinedher breasts one day in September 2004. Marie-No\u00eblle M.,48 years of age, was operated for breast cancer on Febru- ary 4th, at Martigues Hospital. One month later, Marie-No\u00eblle pushes open the door of the consulting room at the Institut Paoli-Calmettes inMarseilles, a regional anti-cancer centre, where JacquesCamerlo is waiting for her. This doctor coordinates the localpilot programme for the new cancer notification system.\"We are going to go back over everything and reformulate everything,\" he announces. Before starting to examine her , Jacques Camerlo talks to her about her illness: \"Breast cancer is a common disease which affects one in nine women. It can becured and removed if various stages and treatments arecomplied with.\" Marie-No\u00eblle interrupts the stream that tome,\" or \"that' s not much fun,\" when the subject of chemotherapy is broached. She has clearly thought about her illness a great deal. Some questions are very specific: \" Am I going to have a wig? \" Other questions are more fundamental: \"What are mychances of really getting better?\" Jacques Camerlo answers, without beating about the bush: \"The treatment that you will have will make it possi-ble to get rid of the disease. We will have done everything inorder for you not to need to come back to see us. You will havemore than a 70% to 80% chance of it not coming back.\" Marie-No\u00eblle's two sons, aged 27 and 25, are very well-informed, as is her husband. \"I want my children tocontinue with their lives as normal,\" she says. \"I don't wantthem to be watching over me too much.\" A little later, she confides: \"I am a worrier by nature, especially about others.\" Jacques Camerlo tells her: \"Takecare of yourself first. Your day-to-day, social and emotion-al life must continue normally . The side-effects of the treatment are temporary and reversible.\" \" Call me\" The doctor describes the different stages of the six- month treatment plan awaiting Marie-No\u00eblle -chemotherapy sessions every three weeks, then daily radiotherapy for four to six weeks. He gives her thenames of the doctors who will be involved. He then tellsher of the various possible side-effects of the treatment, and the symptoms that she should watch out for - par-ticularly any signs of a fever, as the treatment will severe- ly compromise Marie-No\u00eblle's immune system. \"I amgoing to need a computer to remember all that,\" she quips. Having summarised her forthcoming phases of treat- ment in a document entitled \"Theoretical treatment plan\",which he gives her , and having dictated in her presence a letter to the doctor who referred her, Jacques Camerlo intro-duces Marie-No\u00eblle to Jean-F ran\u00e7ois Cailhot. Cailhot, a nurse, coordinates the care of women being treated for breast cancer at the Institut Paoli-Calmettes.\"Whatever the problem, call me, I will put you in contactwith the people you need,\" he says, giving her his card. The nurse asks Marie-No\u00eblle what is the main problem that she is concerned about. \"Losing my hair\", she answersimmediately , adding: \"I have already found out about wigs.\" He tells her that her hair will start to fall out at thestart of the second week of treatment, and mentions thevarious models of wig, reminding her that a hairdresser isavailable at the Institute. Next subject: side-effects. His advice relates to everyday life: \"You will be given drugs, but we cannot predict how youwill react. Try not to plan too many activities during the threedays following the chemotherapy session,\" he stresses. Mentioning the possibility of a fever, he recommends: \"Somebody must be available to bring you here 24 hoursa day, 7 days a week. You must keep the phone numberof a taxi or an ambulance on you and a packed suitcase. Itdoesn't happen often, but ...\" He reminds Marie-No\u00eblle that a psychologist and a social worker are at her disposal, and that she does not haveto pay for her transport to the Institute for the chemother-apy sessions. He concludes by giving her an informationleaflet on breast cancer. Feeling a mixture of resignation and satisfaction, fol- lowing this initial contact with those who are going to steerher through her six months of treatment, Marie-No\u00eblle pre-pares to return home.

Master piece 34 ICANCER WORLD IJANUARY/FEBRUARY 2007Tackling cancer the Tunisian way \u00a7 Jim Boumelha Farhat Ben Ayedplayed a key role in building T unisia' s cancer services, armed with little more than a solid education, a sense of duty and a remarkable talent for motivating others.Fighting cancer, he believes, is a question of citizenship and solidarity, and limited resourcescannot be allowed to stand in the way . Rising life expectancy , swift urbanisation and major changes in dietary habits allpreface an inexorable rise in cancer . Tunisia fits this description. With 10,000 new cases a year, this small country is on a rising cancer curve. W ith the limited resources of a country in transition, it is about to cross its Rubicon. Unlike many countries moulded by similar historical events (the French occupation ended50 years ago), Tunisia has no army to speak of,investing its human capital in education andhealth. Tunisia's health budget tops 8% ofnational spending. This is perhaps one reason why Professor Farhat Ben Ayed, the father of Tunisian oncolo-gy, is in an almost permanent state of reflectionon the meaning of the fight against cancer , in particular with the cost \"of what has alreadybeen done and what we have failed to accom-plish\". It is also a reason why equality of treat - ment has become almost an obsession. Hiscommitment to cancer patients is a commit-ment to people' s rights. \"The fight against cancerfor me is not just a question of specialists, but most crucially an issue of citizenship.\" In identifying risks and setting out strategies to improve prevention and early detection, to develop new therapies and to improve social rehabilitation, Ben Ayed is careful not to follow blindly the example of Europe. \"We have differ- ent priorities. Our top priority is the fight to reduce tobacco consumption because lung can-cer is the number one killer in our country. It can-not be breast cancer detection, where we arehampered by the fact that it is most prevalentamong the under 35s, making it difficult toscreen. With our foreign friends we discuss con-tinuously what kind of projects we need toadvance, what can or can't be achieved and,most importantly, what can we do to affect themaximum of people.\" With 25% of cancer patients coming for- ward at such a late stage that curative treatmentis no longer possible, it has been necessary todevelop psychosocial support for individualsand families living with cancer. In the Tunisiancontext, oncologists have also to grapple with theMaster piece CANCER WORLD I JANUARY/FEBRUARY 2007 I 35ent state of thinking, it does not just affect the individual, but has an impact on the family as a whole.The whole family is weakened;their social status goes down, acutedepression follows.\" Patients are developing higher expectations, both in terms of which cancers can be cured and what happens to patients when acure is not possible. Palliative careand the concept of a hospital with-out pain have become the norm. Thanks to a monopoly on importa - tion of drugs, the state-owned Phar-macie Centrale makes most drugs,including all types of opiates, wide - ly available, putting Tunisia aheadof many other Arab countries in its ability to deliver pain relief. Although Pharmacie Centrale imports most of the newer cancerdrugs, Ben Ayed stresses that much of the progress, in particular in pae-diatric oncology , has been achieved by making better use of old drugs.The top priority must remain theoverall interest of all patients andnot just a privileged few, he says. Tunisia has not the means to gam- ble precious resources on a treat - ment that can only be used for 8% of patients. The strong arm of the state makes a difference for both drugs and infra-structure - most hospitals are now equippedwith scanners and there are six MRI machines inTunis alone - but there is an acute need to fur-ther develop the national cancer plan, so that itdoes not remain the sole property of the cancerspecialist. Ben Ayed argues that the involve-ment of citizens is a major missing component. \"Top priority must remain the overall interest of all patients, not just a privileged few\" notion that cancer is a punishment. The first and most crucial action has been to focus ondemystifying cancer which remains a taboosubject. Tunisian families live in such a fear ofthe disease that they cannot bring themselvesto call it by its name. \"We are struggling to convince families that cancer is just like any other disease. In the pres-Master piece 36 I CANCER WORLD I JANUARY/FEBRUARY 2007Unlike oil-rich countries in the Arab world, Tunisia has no petrodollar reserves. Pioneers like Ben Ayed organise the fight against cancer with few resources, armed with a solid educa-tion, a sense of duty and exceptional organisa - tional wizardry in the art of motivating others. Partly as a result, Tunisian oncology punches far above its weight. Ben Ayed learned two things from his child- hood - he assimilated from his home island of Djerba the art of being a hard taskmaster and,from his parents, a sense of giving without expect-ing anything in return. He set out to study philosophy but converted to medicine once he saw his older brother inaction - Si Hassouna was to become the firstTunisian nephrologist. Ben Ayed enrolled at themedical school in Montpellier, and con-ducted his postgraduate diploma at Tunis and theGustave-Roussy Institute, in V illejuif, F rance. Ben Ayed came home with a mission - to help build the foundation of medical oncology inTunisia. He worked to strengthen the first and second pillars of this work, cooperation with theoutside world and the Tunisian Cancer Institute(now called Salah Azaiez). The third pillar , theFarhat Ben Ayed talking to patients at the Eddar Hospice in T unis creation of an association to fight cancer, is where he has concentrated his efforts for the last 20 years. Over two millennia, Tunisia has been invaded by Vandals, Phoenicians, Greeks, Romans andArabs. In modern times, it became a province ofthe Ottoman Empire and later a French colony. Itis not surprising to find a tradition of cooperating with others profoundly ingrained in the coun- try's psyche and within the scientific community.The French not only left a substantial legacy, butcontinued to play a major role in training Tunisianoncologists and helping the country develop its infrastructure. Charles Nicolle, the first doctor to win the Nobel Prize in Medicine while working on African soil (he discovered the transmission agent fortyphus), conducted his research from the PasteurInstitute in T unis. French oncologists gave the impetus in the late 1960s to creating what was to become theSalah Azaiez Institute, the nerve centre of Tunisian oncology and the first cancer institute in the Arab world. Ben Ayed shows great respect for the person - al commitment of F rench colleagues. \"To be hon- est it was a generous cooperation. They gave somuch and never asked anything in return.\" His studies in France arose from a visit by a French team to Tunis during which he met Jean Louis Amiel, a leading oncologist at the Gus- tave-Roussy Institute, the beginning of a friend- ship that would last until Amiel died in 1985. \"We went on to build an exceptional network offriends, people with an exceptional knowledge.This was the first step for us in building ourknowledge of clinical oncology and understandingthe founding principles of biological oncology.From there on, there was no going back. I washooked into medical oncology. \"Many outstanding personalities like Professor Amiel became icons. He often travelled to Tunisas a friend not just as a colleague. And even today , after his death, when confronted with a thorny problem we often try to imagine: what wouldProfessor Amiel do in such a case?\" The mix of professional and friendship ties meant that it was not difficult to involve col-leagues from institutes and hospitals all overMaster piece CANCER WORLD I JANUARY/FEBRUARY 2007 I 37France - Marseilles, Rouen, Lyon, Gustave Roussy Institute, St Cloud. A simple phone call was enough to convince them to make the trip.The multidisciplinarity of the Tunisian cancerinstitute was in large part thanks to this input. Other countries became involved. The Italians helping to set up screening for cervical cancer andshort courses for doctors and interns. Later, the training of trainers was taken up by the French national anti-cancer league with thehelp of the UICC. A French NGO, Douleur sansfronti\u00e8res, set up training to show general practi-tioners how to treat pain. International collabo- ration is still important. A soon-to-be-published report on the epidemiology of cancer of the larynxorganised by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) brought togetherresearchers from Tunisia, Indonesia, Canada,China and F rance. T unisia is also involved in a number of international phase II and III research projects. Tunisian oncologists also recognise the need to build horizontal links with colleagues from the restof the Arab world and the African continent. BenAyed has been building steps towards lasting cooperation between oncologists from theMaghreb (\"the West\") - made up of Morocco,Algeria and T unisia. \"The Maghreb is my top priority. We all received the same French training, which makes it easy for us to work together and communicate.So it's not difficult to knit a web united around common options and joint work. \"Every year there are 70,000 new cases of cancer - 30,000 in each of Morocco and Alge-ria and 10,000 in Tunisia. We are currently dis-cussing whether all these new cases arereceiving an adequate and correct treatment. Itwould be all too easy to find excuses because ofour inadequate resources. But this should notprevent us from researching, for example, thepsychosocial context - how to deal with thequality of life in Tunisia and the rest of the Mediterranean region.\" Ben Ayed is less optimistic about links with the rest of the Arab world. He argues that theArab League has the necessary structures tolead the fight against cancer in the region, butsays that this is inhibited by rivalries betweencountries. Tunisia would like to do more in the way of training for doctors from sub-Saharan Africa.Lack of international recognition for Tunisiandiplomas means that there is little incentive forAfrican doctors to do their training here. Howev- er, strong links have been built with F rench- speaking countries in West Africa. None of this cooperation would have taken shape without the Salah Azaiez Institute as the engine driving the fight against cancer in Tunisia.Since its inception in 1969, the Institute hasbased its structures, development and day-to- day practices on the Gustave-Roussy Institute, including administration, care and training. However , the Tunisian approach to cancer treatment and care has evolved from local real-ities. \"Our starting point was to cure every case.We realised very quickly that we could not. This is one reason why developing palliative carebecame a prime dimension of our work. It isthrough training specialists in the treatment of pain and in palliative care that we managed to open the door for the training of paediatriconcologists. It has also led to the development of psychosocial support for individuals and families living with cancer.\" The Institute has revolutionalised the teach- ing of cancer at the Tunisian medical faculty. Forexample, paediatric oncology was not recog-nised as a specialty at the faculty until it waspracticed at the Institute. Today, Tunisian chil-dren's hospitals all handle childhood cancers.The Institute also encouraged the publication ofhigh-quality research reports by Tunisian teams \"It would be all too easy to find excuses because of our inadequate resources\"Master piece 38 I CANCER WORLD I JANUARY/FEBRUARY 2007on child lymphomas, breast cancers and other topics, raising their international profile. The Institute has influenced other regions of Tunisia - Sfax and Sousse are also developing asmajor cancer treatment centres. Multidiscipli-nary treatment, palliative care, psychosocial themes, and research have become central pil - lars in the fight against breast, colorectal andlung cancer . Many doctors are still sent abroad to learn new approaches to treatment and care. A few stayaway, lured by better wages and prestige. However , most return with a renewed allegiance to their home country and find immense satisfaction in what they are doing. \"When 80% of children arecured of cancer , isn't it great to see some of them growing up and becoming doctors or engineers,\"notes Ben Ayed with a smile. He believes that an effective fight against cancer rests on a partnership between the public,the private and civic society . \"Every person has a role to play. Cancer is a question of solidarity. Everybody should join the fight.\" After years of developing medical approach - es to cancer treatment, Ben Ayed was spurred to greater action by seeing patients in distress. In 1987, with friends and co-thinkers, he cre-ated the Tunisian Association for the Fightagainst Cancer (ATLCC), and in 2000, theAssociation for the Promotion of Pain and Pal-liative Care. In the hands of Ben Ayed, the ATLCC has grown into a humanitarian and scientific associ-ation with a public service brief, that also pro-motes teaching and prevention. Thirty percent of cancers in T unisia are linked to the environment and 40% to tobacco,especially cancers of the lungs, throat and blad-der. The campaign against tobacco has become the top priority for the association. This rangesfrom efforts to convince farmers to replace tobac-co cultivation with other crops, to lively teach-in\"I admire the Canadians and Irish for their willingness to confront the tobacco lobby\" sessions in partnership with the train company SNCFT on one of their busiest commuter lines. Indeed, 'smokeless' trains have become arenowned feature of World Anti-tobacco Day,attracting positive coverage on Tunisian pressand television (although they revert to being 'smoking' trains the next day). Ben Ayed is committed to change in a country where virtually half of men smoke. (A W orld Health Survey in 2003, showed that 49.5% of menover the age of 18 smoke, while only 2.4% ofwomen over the age of 18 do so.) He said: \"Iadmire the Canadians and Irish for their willing - ness to confront the tobacco lobby and take effec-tive action. In T unisia we have adequate legislation, but nobody takes any notice. In arecent study we found that 95% of people are wellaware of the risks. Our aim is not just to informbut to change behaviours.\" He believes in the value of engaging children at school about the risks during special nation - al and regional anti-tobacco days. When chil- dren go home they take with them the knowledge and arguments they have heard - apowerful means to debunk myths with parents and family. Education, training and information are the bedrock of the ATLCC prevention strategy.Special programmes, such as palpation tech-niques for breast examinations, are aimed at thegeneral practitioner (GP), who is seen as thefirst line of defence. Ben Ayed believes thatthe GP must also be an educator and a com-municator. National training days, conferences and seminars are other useful ways to reach spe - cialists. A two-day international seminar wasorganised in Tunisia by Ben Ayed and FrancoCavalli from Bellinzona, Switzerland, with theEuropean School of Oncology in December2005. The ATLCC is often at its most creativeMaster piece CANCER WORLD I JANUARY/FEBRUARY 2007 I 39Ben Ayed with Henda Ra\u00efs, the fir st doctor in T unisia to be trained as a specialist for pain and palliative care in cancer able to take care of our needs and better manage our expenditure.\" The association has also focused on devel- oping palliative care, becoming the local chapterof the International Association for the Study of Pain. It has found time to address ethical issues, bringing together a philosopher, a jurist, a nurse and a sociologist to discuss clinical research and trials. Ben Ayed brought in his own expertise asa member of the French and Francophone Soci-ety of Medical Ethics at University Paris V. He concludes that value judgements are not the same everywhere. \"Ethics concerns person-al behaviour but it is also a reflection of society.However, we found in the end no differencebetween different religions in their stand onethical questions.\" Ben Ayed is renowned for saying little and saying it quietly. He abhors loud plaudits. He grapples with philosophical concepts and aspectsof humanity beyond what can be recorded oncharts and medical records. Without raising hisvoice, he sums up his quest: \"I want Tunisiansnot to be afraid of cancer anymore.\" when raising money. It raised funds to buy the first mammography machine for the Cancer Institute and teamed up with a chemical com-pany to buy another for Gab\u00e8s hospital in thesouth. The success of the association shamed the authorities into action. Treatment centresopened in Sousse and in Sfax. The Government also released land to the association to build Eddar hospice. It was built with hard work anddetermination - a dinar here and a lorry-load ofbricks there - with Ben Ayed as motivator, cam-paigner and executive. He asked students at the school of architecture to lend a hand with the design. He begged students elsewhere to sellpostcards for a year to furnish it. Since its launch in 1993, the hospice has lodged more than 1,000 cancer patients, most ofwhom needed somewhere to stay during treat - ment in T unis. Thousands of other patients have received financial help. Ben Ayed says that thetremendous wave of solidarity around buildingthe hospice grew stronger after it opened.\"Scores of volunteers are involved day in, day out,in a loose support network. Some prepare thefood, others just give moral support.\" Now Ben Ayed has set his sight on building, with the help of the Ligue fran\u00e7aise contre lecancer and the UICC, an information centre to be used by the public and the media, as well as by students and health professionals. Leading oncologists do not often vacate their labs to negotiate deals with outside organ- isations. One of the most imaginative was withthe national train company. Backed by the can-cer institute, the association agreed to screenthe rail company's female staff for cervical can-cer, in exchange for SNCFT agreeing to trans-port cancer patients to and from treatmentcentres free of charge. Another idea was to recycle printer car- tridges, which raised awareness about environ-mental issues and paid for a mammographymachine. Ben Ayed says: \"With limited resources, the only option open was to innovate and developactivities commensurate with what is achievable.In Tunisia everything is a priority, but this shouldnot be an excuse for doing nothing.

The W orld Cancer Declaration adopted at the UICC Congress inWashington this summer aims to be different from other closing statements - longer on action than in words. Most conferences end with a declaration or statement, and most vanish into the ether. Nobody has yet been cured of cancer, or even ofthe common cold, by rhetoric. Without hard slogto turn the rhetoric into action, conventionsand declarations are soon forgotten. On the other hand, declarations can play a valuable role in setting agendas, focusing atten-tion on the main issues, and bringing peopletogether to work in the same direction. The cancer world has had its share of big statements in recent years. In 2000, the W orld Summit against Cancer in the New Millenniumadopted the Charter of Paris. This adopted arights agenda, and focused on early detection,translational research, clinical guidelines, evi-dence-based medicine, quality of life andpatient advocacy . Most people remember anoth -er outcome of the summit better than the ten articles and preamble of the Charter, since thiswas the meeting that established 4 F ebruary each year as 'World Cancer Day'. In May 2003, the World Health Assembly (WHA), the global 'P arliament' of the World Health Organization, opened the WHO Frame- work Convention on Tobacco Control for sig- nature. The FCTC came into force in February2005 and has become one of the most widelyembraced treaties in the history of the UnitedNations. This was seen as a declaration of waron the harmful effects of tobacco, and hasstrengthened international campaigns againstthe tobacco industry. However, the 38 Articlesand more than 9,000 words are not especiallymemorable. And many governments haveproved readier to sign it than to take actionafterwards. In May 2005, the WHA, \"alarmed by the ris- ing trends of cancer risk-factors, the number ofnew cancer cases, and cancer morbidity andmortality worldwide, in particular in developingcountries,\" passed a landmark resolution onSpotlight on... CANCER WORLD I JANUARY/FEBRUARY 2007 I 43calls to action are admirably brief. It was the result of widespread consultation and has the support of high-profile global intergovernmen - tal agencies. However, the Declaration was essentially produced by NGOs, so it has natu- ral allies to work with it in every country. The Declaration has a short shelf-life, since progress will be monitored and reported to eachWorld Congress, after which it will be redraft-ed. It must therefore show results by the nextUICC Congress in Geneva in August 2008. Relative simplicity was not easy to achieve. Responsibility for the early drafts rested with thehosts for the Washington Congress, the Amer-ican Cancer Society (ACS). T en months in advance of the Congress, the ACS and UICCtrawled a list of 250 experts worldwide for ideasabout what it should contain. Unsurprisingly , the first draft ran to 20 pages. This draft went back to the experts and global bodies (WHO, IARC etc) for comment. Thecancer prevention and control that set the agen- da for comprehensive national cancer control plans in each country . For the first time the WHO declared cancer to be a priority issue for all governments. This has given a tremendous boost to global efforts on cancer, but the com-prehensive nature of the resolution and theplodding UN language, means that it is hardlya call to arms. The World Cancer Declaration adopted at the UICC World Cancer Congress in Wash-ington July 2006 sets out to fill the gap. It doesnot set a new agenda, but attempts to identifystrategic and urgent steps that cancer organi-sations and campaigners can address in theshort term. This is unashamedly an advocacydeclaration, designed to give a much higherprofile to cancer and to put it on the politicaland public agenda. At under 1,000 words, it is less than half the length of the Charter of P aris, and the nine key PHILIPPE BLANC / ANGALIA-PHOTOAnti-cancer vaccination.

Then began the process of simplifying and clarifying - it took sixor seven drafts to achieve the short version. At the Congress itself, participants were given three days to comment on the draft, and sug- gestions were made at a 'W orld Leader Summit' - although the Declaration hardly changed at this late stage. Franco Cavalli, President of the UICC, says that brevity and clarity were key aims, as it isimportant that the Declaration is backed withaction. \"Of course, the World Cancer Declara-tion is based on the Charter of Paris, but theidea was to have something which could havemuch more immediate results, to pick topicsthat seem to be the most important and urgentand to summarise them very briefly. The Char-ter of P aris is a declamatory declaration withoutimmediate consequences; here we are trying to have consequences. \"It is not enough to have governments signing declarations, you need interventions from civil society to push governments to realise what they have written. Here the driving forces wereNGOs. We are trying to follow the example of the AIDS NGOs, which have been able to put the topic of AIDS on the political and mediaagenda, which, alas, has not yet been the casefor cancer.\" Cavalli admits that he was initially sceptical, but is increasingly enthusiastic about the Decla-ration's power to mobilise. He was at the ChineseCongress on Cancer in October, organised bythe two major Chinese associations. They fur-ther reduced the World Cancer Declaration tosix points, set priorities for combating cancer in The Declaration was essentially produced by NGOs, so it has natural allies in every country WHOThe next generation.

At a meeting in Bangkok in early November - Empowering Cancer Prevention in the AsiaPacific - the Declaration was also a topic fordebate in many of the sessions. \"What I am hearing is much more positive than what I expected. I have the impression that this is starting to create a little avalanche whichis increasing speed. The fact that such a decla - ration has been launched is a sign of themomentum which is being created currentlyabout the emerging problem of cancer in thedeveloping world. There was an editorial by Peter Boyle in the Lancet and I published an edi- torial in the last issue of Nature Clinical Practice Oncology . This is part of a movement which is just starting to roll.\" The Declaration says that it \"requires part - nerships between governments, private sector , non-governmental organisations, and interna-tional organisations\". Cavalli cites the PACT global partnership that brings together governmental and non-govern- mental entities involved in cancer control, as a good example. \"There are different types of partnership. I think that the private sector is to be understood mainly in the sense that NGOsand private organisations should be also verymuch involved. As regards the private sector inthe narrower sense, meaning private hospitalsand structures, this is so different from countryto country, it is in my opinion very difficult tohave a general statement. If you set up a cancercontrol plan you have to include NGOs and theprivate sector, but the responsibility of courselies with the government. That is quite clear .\" The Declaration has been translated into several languages and is now being distributedworldwide amongst UICC members. TheUICC is preparing an action plan based onthe Declaration, and is talking to WHO aboutmonitoring progress. \"W e want to monitorwhere we will be in 2008 so we can judge progress,\" says Cavalli. \"We will see whether there will be 10 or 15 countries more with a can-cer control plan than in the past.\" The full text of the World Cancer Declara- tion can be downloaded at http://www.uicc.org/ WORLD CANCER DECLARATION - SUMMARY The W orld Cancer Declaration pr edicts that by 2020 ther e will be 16 million new cancer cases and 10 million cancer deaths each year, with 70% of the deaths in developing countries.

In Ljubljana, politicians, experts andpatients came together to debate cancer plans, political will, funding and ways to stopskilled staff leaving home. It had been a year since the signing of the W ar- saw Declaration on cancer services in Centraland Eastern Europe - long enough perhaps forpoliticians to have forgotten their undertakingsand moved on to other issues. Instead, a critical mass of MPs, MEPs and health administrators gathered in the Sloveniancapital, Ljubljana, in November 2006 to renew their commitment to closing the gap between can- cer outcomes in the east and west of Europe, and todiscuss ways of making it happen. This was a working conference, organised by the European Cancer Patient Coalition, at whichpoliticians, cancer experts and patients groupsfrom all over Europe dedicated time to workingout how to ensure that the aims of the WarsawDeclaration are fulfilled. Given equal services, people in Central and Eastern European (CEE) countries should be atlower risk of dying of cancer, because these countrieshave the fewest diagnosed cases in the whole ofEurope. However , women in CEE countries are only slightly less likely to die of cancer than their sistersin Western and Northern Europe, while CEE menare much more likely to die than their counterparts. In the period 1983-1994 the survival statistics in some CEE countries improved, but more slow-ly than the average for the rest of Europe. Insome CEE countries, survival rates actually fell. So, the gap between east and west is growingrather than narrowing. \"Do our governments know about these fig - ures?\" asked a representative from the Institute ofPatients Rights in Poland. \"Where can we findcopies Slovakian MEP, had heard the statistics for the first time at the October conferenceof the European Society for Medical Oncology. Two days before travelling to Ljubljana, she pre- sented them to her health minister. \"He wasshocked,\" she said. The conference heard presentations about the two most comprehensive programmes implement-ed in Europe to date. The French and UK CancerPlans both tackle cancer from prevention and earlydetection to training, guidelines, organisation ofcare and rehabilitation. The French plan alsoaddresses social issues such as rights at work. Manydelegates cited these contributions as giving help - ful information to take home. Ariana Znaor from the Croatian National Insti- tute of Public Health valued the precision of the UKexperience. \"What I found useful was the setting ofvery specific targets,\" she said. She was alsoimpressed by the patient-orientation of theBut there is evidence that things are beginning to change. Evgenia Adarska,president of the cancerpatients group, APOZ, report-ed a political and media stormin Bulgaria, when a member ofthe parliamentary health com- mittee said: \"It is immoral to ask for more money for onco-logical treatment because can-cer patients are already dead.\"The MP was disciplined - and Bulgaria' s cancer patients now stand to gain from the 30%increase in the health budgetthey had been fighting for . In Hungary too, K\u00f6k\u00e9ny says that people have startedtalking publicly about cancer - as part of a general climate of greater openness. \"Developing cancer care wasnot an area that local politicians and the governmentfelt should be a priority. It was swept under the car-pet. Now everyone has to face the statistics.\" RESOURCES AND STAFF However , there remains a problem with funding. Znaor, from Croatia, points out that CEE countries missed out on support from Europe Against Cancer because it ended before they joined. \"Organisedscreening programmes are major undertakings that don't give quick results, and cost a lot of money.\" Transformation from the old socialist systems has taken its toll, while countries involved in the fightingthat accompanied the break-up of Yugoslavia are stilltrying to rebuild their infrastructure. Fatmire Mulhaxha-Koll\u00e7aku chairs the Com- mittee on Health, Labour and Social Reform inthe Kosovan parliament. As part of Yugoslavia,Kosovo was progressively starved of resources, shesaid. The unresolved separation from Serbia leftKosovo without any oncology centre or even aradiotherapy facility. These are having to be con-structed from scratch, by an administration thatis struggling even to get its telephone systemfunctioning properly.

W e need to support patient groups, and involve them. Cancer is an important issue but it cannot just be left to the medical people.\" A PLACE ON THE AGENDA In many CEE countries, cancer remains taboo, denied a profile in public life and the media, with nochance of becoming a political priority. Both MikeRichards, architect of the UK Cancer Plan, andBrigitte Guillemette from the French NationalCancer Institute, stressed that advances had onlybeen possible with top-level, sustained politicalsupport. The Ljubljana gathering was itself in partthe result of political backing from former Sloven-ian President, Alojz P eterle, the founding spirit and vice-chair of MEPs Against Cancer. Countries struggle to break free of a negative mind-set. Simone Ene, who works with the Associ - ation of Cancer Patients in Romania, says that peo- ple and politicians \"are blind to the issue of cancer.They treat cancer as a fatal disease not a chronic one.\" Unacceptable.

Hildrun Sund-seth, conference organiserand head of the Brusselsoffice of the European Can-cer P atient Coalition, appealed to MEPs, MPs and patient groups alike to argue the case for investing in can - cer. Cancer plans, she said, were also on the agenda for the next meeting ofMEPs Against Cancer . An acute awareness of the benefits of national, quality-assured screening programmes, includingone for colorectal cancer , was evident across all the countries. Joaquim Gouveia, Portugal's first National Coordinator for Oncology Diseases, emphasisedthe importance of creating a \"common language of indicators and effectiveness studies\", and said that benchmarking could be crucial to bring-ing cancer control in all countries up to thelevel of the best. K\u00f6k\u00e9ny supports the need for standardised data, even down to individual hospital level onwaiting times, caseloads, complication rates andso on. He mentions three areas where he wouldlike the EU to take a lead.

Two years ago, the EU Clinical Trials Directive caused widespread dismay as it failed to take account of the need to conduct independent, aca - demic clinical research. Poto cnik made it clear that he does recognise the vital role of such work. Hesaid that the forthcoming Research F ramework Programme would link research, prevention, diag-nosis and treatment, emphasise translationalresearch, back the identification of best clinical practices and optimise the use of cancer registries for cancer research. He acknowledged concerns over the failure to agree a Europe-wide validation system for contin-uing medical education (CME) to keep physiciansup to date in a rapidly changing field. TOPPRIORITY The Ljubljana meeting was another important mile- stone in the long process of getting cancer onto the public and political agenda. The journey has includ - ed the emergence of patient advocates, national can- cer plans, the Europe Against Cancer programme (1985-2000), the development of a European net-work of cancer registries, the establishment of theEuropean Cancer Patient Coalition (2004), thefirst meeting of EU health ministers on cancer(Paris, 2005), and the launch of MEPs AgainstCancer (2005). Ljubljana brought many elementsthat reflect this progress together in the same room. Slovenia's secretary of state for health, Dorjan Maru sic, said that there was clearly a strong will \"to continue on this track, to share ideas, to find solu - tions - not just at the level of experts and citizens butalso at a political level.\" During a political roundtablediscussion, MEPs, MPs, experts and patients decid - ed to meet again in 2007 to continue the dialogue. For Maru sic, this is part of the build-up to the Slovenian EU Presidency in 2008, which theyintend to use to give the fight against cancer a top priority. This will offer an unprecedented chance for patients, experts and politicians to push the issue up the agendas in their own countries. It could also give a boost to patient power across Europe. Alojz Peterle, a prime mover behind theconference, has himself been diagnosed with prostate cancer and is standing for the Slovenian Presidency. Were he to win, the EU would, in2008, have a cancer patient advocate at its head forthe first time. THE WARSAW DECLARATION The Warsaw Declaration was launched at the second summit of can- cer patient and advocacy gr oups in Central and Easter n Europe in November 2005, and called for ur gent action to close the gap between CEE countries and the rest of Europe in cancer prevalenceand sur vival rates. 1.Develop national cancer plans, setting priorities and allocating resour ces, for impr oving cancer contr ol and research in all CEE countries and assure patients' groups monitoring over the implementation of these plans. 2.Invest in cancer pr evention by promoting awareness, information and education campaigns about the risk factors of cancer, building on the European Code against Cancer . 3.Invest in national screening programmes as recommended by the European Union; and implement high-quality EU standards to support early diagnosis. 4.Make high-quality up-to-date treatment, rehabilitation and care attainable for all cancer patients throughout Europe. 5.Encourage and ensure patient participation in all decisions on health policy and health care affecting cancer. 6.Advance cancer control as a priority for action where necessary to qualify for grants from the EU Structural Funds. 7.Oppose discrimination because of age, race, gender , domicile and economic status in respect of the latest cancer treatment. 8.Encourage and adopt national Charters of Patients' Rights accord- ing to Eur opean guidelines.

Astudy by P aik et al. (see oppo - site) has shown that a well-characterised recurrence score (RS) using information on the expres - sion of 21 genes can successfully sep-arate women who benefit from breastcancer chemotherapy from those whodo not. Their study has severalstrengths: the RS has been developedwith careful attention to both labora- tory and statistical procedures and has been standardised to become com - mercially available, RS has already been found to predict recurrence and survival in a validation dataset (NSABPB-14), 1and a meticulous training phase was carried out using three independ-ent databases to maximise generalisa-tion. Moreover, the treatment-RSinteraction is demonstrated in 651node-negative, oestrogen-receptor-pos-itive women, a sample size much larg-er than used for most previous researchon gene expression profiles. 2 The interaction term between treatment and RS identified by Paik etal. has borderline statistical signifi - cance ( P=0.038). Interestingly, even though the study population is derivedfrom a randomised trial (NSABP B-20), the distribution of RS levels dif-fers between thetamoxifen and the tamoxifen pluschemotherapy arms ( P=0.036). This result illustrates that biases andchance alone may yield similar Pval- ues to those found for the interaction term; however , an interaction is not necessarily required for a predictive score to be useful in therapeutic deci- sions. In the low-risk group, absoluterisk is so low that chemotherapy is notrecommended in any case. The question is whether RS pro- vides treatment guidance in addition tothat available using routine information(e.g. age, tumour grade and receptorlevels). RS correlates with and might bemore informative than these classicpredictors; however , even age, while clearly seen to have an interaction withthe treatment effect in the full NSABPB-20 database, did not reach nominal significance in the 651 patients analysed in this study , owing to limited power . We need very large studies to discern the exact incremental benefitof RS interactions over classic predic - tors. Such predictors, which are rou - tinely available, should be included inprognostic models. The greatest concern regarding Paik et al.'s study is that tamoxifen-treated patients from the NSABP B-20 studywere used in the original development of the RS, and data from these patients were important in the selection of the21-gene signature 1. RS is thus expect- ed to (and does) differentiate the riskwithin the tamoxifen arm, since it hasbeen trained purposely on these data.Conversely, RS does not appropriatelydifferentiate recurrence risk in theNSABP B-20 chemotherapy arm. Thiscontrast of good predictive perform-ance in the tamoxifen arm and poorperformance in the chemotherapy armis what causes the significant treat- John Ioannidis is Chair of the Department of Hygiene and Epidemiology at the University of Ioannina School of Medicine, Ioannina, Greece, with a joint appointment at Tufts University School of Medicine, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.

Given that the tamoxifen arm was a training dataset, the correct interpretation ofthe data is not necessarily that RS is asuperb predictor of treatmentresponse. An alternative interpretationis that RS, while previously validated inthe independent NSABP B-14 dataset, 2now fails to be validated in the independent data of the chemotherapyarm of NSABP B-20. As gene expression profiling moves from exploratory research into clinical practice, rigorous testing with fully independent validations should con-tinue. 3 Useful molecular signatures need to be trained and tested on sev- eral thousands of patients.4The vali- dation work to date is retrospectiveand thus provides only preliminaryevidence. The TAILORx trial, a largeprospective trial of 8,000 patients,will try to validate this 21-gene signa- ture in the clinical setting. Similarly, the MINDACT trial will try toprospectively validate a different 70-gene prognostic signature. As we moveinto large-scale evidence, making sense of gene expression profiling remains a fascinating challenge. Synopsis S Paik, G T ang, S Shak, et al.

Objective. To determine whether the RS can also predict the magnitude of chemotherapy benefit. Design and intervention. T umour tissue samples were obtained from the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP) B-20 trial, which investigated the value of adding chemotherapy (methotrexate and fluorouracil with or without cyclophos - phamide) to 5 years of tamoxifen therapy in 2,363 patients with node-negative, oestrogen-receptor-positive breast cancer.Patients were enrolled between 17 October 1988 and 5 March 1993. Gene expression was measured using the Oncotype DX assay (Genomic Health Inc., Redwood City, CA). Each RS was determined by measuring the expression of 16 cancer-related genes and5 reference genes, and was calculated on a scale of 0-100. Prespecified cutoff points for low-risk, intermediate-risk and high-riskdisease were RS<18, RS in the range 18-30, and RS 31, respectively . Outcome measures. The primary endpoint was freedom from distant recurrence. Cox proportional hazards models were used to study the interaction between chemotherapy treatment and RS as a continuous variable. Analysis was also performed using thepredefined RS risk categories. Results. Gene expression results were successfully obtained for 227 patients treated with tamoxifen alone and 424 patients treat- ed with tamoxifen plus chemotherapy. Patients did not benefit equally from chemotherapy; those with a high risk of recurrencehad a greater magnitude of benefit from chemotherapy than those with an intermediate or low risk of recurrence. Adding chemother-apy to tamoxifen improved the 10-year Kaplan-Meier estimate for freedom from distant recurrence from 60% to 88% in the high-risk group. The high-risk category benefited from chemotherapy, with a large reduction in distant recurrence at 10 years (relativerisk [RR] 0.26, 95% CI 0.13-0.53; decrease in absolute risk 27.6%). This benefit was less clear for patients in the intermediate-risk group (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.24-1.59; increase in absolute risk 1.8%), but a clinically important benefit from chemotherapy couldnot be excluded. No reduction in distant recurrence at 10 years was demonstrated for patients in the low-risk category (RR 1.31,95% CI 0.46-3.78; increase in absolute risk 1.1%). In a multivariate analysis, the interaction between chemotherapy treatmentand RS was significant ( P=0.038); however, no clear cutoff point for RS could be defined. Conclusion. The RS can predict the magnitude of benefit from chemotherapy for patients with node-negative, oestrogen-recep- tor-positive breast cancer , as well as the likelihood of recurrence of breast cancer, and could be used to select patients who would respond well to chemotherapy.

In a recent study (see opposite), Petersen et al. observed a poor level of agreement between patient and physician assessments of patients' health- related quality of life (HRQOL) on firstcontact, with no significant improve - ment during follow-up encounters. Myresearch group made a similar observa-tion in 49 patients admitted to an acutepalliative care unit, 1with a tendency for physicians to underrate most symptoms, particularly sedation, shortness of breath,and pain. Other authors have observed both underrating and overrating by health-care professionals. 2These findings emphasise the need for routine patient-based symptom assessment in the clini-cal setting. Unfortunately, except for painevaluation, such assessments are infre-quent in clinical practice, even withinpalliative care centres. Even for painevaluations, the accuracy of these assess-ments when conducted within regularclinical care has been questioned. 3 Why does this discrepancy occur? It is possible that physicians do not appro-priately assess the intensity of some symptoms, because of limited time, or insufficient focus on emotional distresswhen debilitating physical symptomsare present. Another possible interpre-tation is that palliative care physiciansmake consistent errors in symptomassessment. An approach that considersthe patient' s numerical report regarding their symptoms as the 'gold standard' would reach this conclusion. The patient' s self-rating of symptom inten- sity needs to be interpreted as a multi- dimensional construct, however. 4-5It is not possible to measure the actual pro-duction of nociceptive input from apainful dyspnoea 'J' receptors inthe lung or respiratory muscles, or theafferent nausea stimulus emerging fromthe gastric wall to produce numericalrepresentations of the primary patho-physiological mechanisms. The per-ception of these stimuli within thesomatosensory cannot bemeasured. A number of inhibitory andfacilitating pathways are capable of altering the intensity of symptom per- ception. Finally , the numerical rating reflects the individual' s expression of symptom perception, which may besignificantly affected by their beliefabout the nature of the symptoms, theirunderstanding of the assessment tool,and cultural and social factors. The impact of this numerical rating on the treatment of the patient's symp- toms has to be taken in context. F or example, a pain intensity score of 8/10 in a patient whose pain had been consis- tently scored at 2 or 3, and who has expe-rienced considerable tumour growth, islikely to overwhelmingly reflect increasednociceptive input and require specificanalgesic therapy. On the other hand, apain intensity score of 8/10 in a patientwho has been consistently expressingsimilar intensity for several months andwho has a history of heavy chemicaldependence is much less likely to reflectnociceptive input and will, therefore,require less analgesia and more psy- Eduardo Bruera heads the Department of Palliative Care and Rehabilitation Medicine at The University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas USA.

Symptoms such as fatigue, nausea, or dyspnoea are sub- ject to similar levels of variability. Patients and palliative care physicians could be interpreted as contributing com-plementary rather than opposing infor-mation from different perspectives. Usinggeneralisability theory, it might be possi- ble to reach a better understanding of the multidimensional construct included ineach of the different symptoms reportedby patients. 5Future research should focus on the influence of mood, delirium, chemical coping, and so on.6In addition, qualitative studies should be conducted tobetter characterise how palliative care physicians make decisions when notice- able differences are observed betweentheir interpretation of a symptom andthat symptom as reported by the patient.

Eur J Cancer 42:1159-1166 Background. Assessment of the efficacy of palliative care measures is subject to a number of biases, linked to difficulty in patient recruitment and the severe attrition that must be expected because of deterioration in patient condition or early death.Although patients' assessment of their own quality of life must be considered the 'gold standard', the use of 'proxy' assessments(e.g. from nurses, clinicians or family) could improve the range and applicability of studies in palliative care. It is importantfor accuracy , however, that these proxy assessments concur with patients' own ratings. Objective. To determine the reliability of physician assessments of patients' health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in palliative care compared with patient assessments. Design. This was a longitudinal study in adult palliative care patients with breast, colorectal, gynaecological, head and neck, lung or other cancers, seen at a single centre and being managed as inpatients, outpatients, or with home care. Intervention. Between June 1998 and August 2003, patients and physicians completed questionnaires including items from the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ)-C30, at their first contact, and then weekly for 13 weeks or for as long as the patients wished or were able to continue. Outcome measure. The outcome measure for this study was the degree of agreement between patients' and physicians' assess- ment of HRQOL at first contact and for the following 13 weeks of care. Results. At the first assessment, 115 patients met the inclusion criteria. A high number of patients were not able to complete 13full weeks of the study (only around 25% of patients were still alive 13 weeks after referral); therefore, the authors focused primarilyon the initial questionnaire and used data from the further time points (weeks 1-13) to verify their findings. Agreement betweenpatients and physicians was poor overall. Patient and physician assessments were significantly different for all HRQOL domainsassessed ( P<0.01 for all). Generally, physicians judged that patients had fewer symptoms and better functioning than did their patients, the exceptions being physical and social functioning. The smallest absolute differences (indicating better reliability) between physi-cian and patient assessments were seen for physical functioning, nausea/vomiting and constipation, and the largest absolute dif-ferences were seen for insomnia and two psychosocial scales: emotional and social functioning. The overall agreement betweenpatient and clinician for the period of time following admission was no better than at the admission consultation. Conclusion. The authors conclude that, despite their experience, physicians working in palliative care have very different per- ceptions of patients' HRQOL than do their patients themselves. The use of physician assessments in palliative care studies may bias findings and should not be considered a viable alternative to patient self-assessment.

It is important that patients ar e not overtreated with drugs that offer no survivalbenefits and ar e associated with bur densome side-effects . Despite improvements in cancer treat- ment, patients with NSCLC, the most commonform of lung cancer, often have a poor prog-nosis. The latest research looked at the optimalduration of palliative chemotherapy for patients with NSCLC. Two hundred and ninety-seven patients with advanced NSCLC (stage IIIB or IV) wererandomised to receive either three or sixcourses of the latest platinum-basedchemotherapy (carboplatin and vinorelbine).Eighty-eight percent of the patients com-pleted an EORTC Quality of Life Question-naire.

The study, conducted by a group at the Istituto Nazionale per lo Studio e la Cura deiTumori, Milan, analysed and estimated breastcancer tr ends in 1 0 Eur opean countries from 1970 to 2005. Interpreting breast cancer survival data can be difficult, as activity such asimproved scr eening and earlier diagnosis can inflate both incidence and survival. The study therefore analysed survival trends in relation tomortality and incidence in or der to give anaccurate overview of breast cancer trends. The study showed that, in most countries included in the analysis, survival from breast can-cer had improved and this could be attributed tobetter care. Those countries included Sweden,the UK, France, Italy and Spain. The study also found that differences in incidence rates seen across Europe in the 1970scontinued into the 21st century, with the low- est incidence in Spain and Italy and the highest incidence in the Netherlands, Denmark, Fin-land, Sweden, and France. In Finland, theNetherlands and Denmark, there was an increase in br east cancer mortality and inci - dence, indicating an increased breast cancer risk, probably r elated to life-style factor s. In Estonia, the r esear ch indicated that ther e was inadequate care for breast cancer patients, as ther e was poor survival in the context of increasing incidence and mortality . The figures overall look promising and point to impr oved tr eatment helping patients live longer in the wealthier Eur opean countries. However the poor results from Estonia suggestthat the survival and tr eatment differ ences in European countries continue to exist.

Current treatments involving high-dose chemother a- py have increased the response rate but more effective approaches are needed to maintainthe dur ation of r esponse. Results from a tenance therapy with thalidomide andpamidr onate c arried out by a team of Euro-pean researchers were recently published. The study showed thalidomide is an effective meansof maintaining duration of response in patientswith multiple myeloma. The study involved 597 patients divided into three groups. The first group was treated with thedrug pamidronate alone, the second group withpamidronate and thalidomide and the thirdgroup received no maintenance therapy. The researchers showed that, four years after diagnosis, the group treated withpamidronate and thalidomide had an overallchance of survival of 87%. Patients in the pamidr onate-alone arm had a 74% pr obability of survival compared with those not receivingtherapy, at 77%. The thr ee-year pr obability of the patients r emaining r elapse-fr ee was 36% without maintenance therapy and 37% with pamidr onate alone. The addition of thalido oved these odds , to 52%. Pamidronate has been used by doctors to protect against bone damage; however , the study found that the drug did not decr ease the number of bone events, as anticipated,and ther e was no significant differ ence in the number of these events between the thr ee treatment groups. However , thalidomide r emains a powerful drug and difficult for some patients to tolerate.The drug was originally dosed at 400 mg per day,but after 15 months , the median dose was decreased by half because of drug-related tox- icity. Thalidomide was discontinued in 39% of the patients taking the drug due to side-effectssuch as numbness, tingling or pain in the handsand feet, fatigue and constipation. In contrast,only 4% of patients discontinued pamidronate. Patients most likely to benefit from the addition of thalidomide to maintenance ther-apy were those whose responses to the originalchemotherapy were not as successful, and thosewho did not have a chromosome 13 deletion -an abnormality found in about 15-20% ofpatients with multiple myeloma and one that isassociated with a poorer prognosis. IMaintenance therapy with thalidomide improves in multiple myeloma patients.M Attal, J-L Harousseau, S Leyvraz, et al.

Ocular adnexal lymphoma of the MALT-type(OAL) is an uncommon type of non-Hodgkin'slymphoma that affects tissues surrounding the eye. It is not normally fatal, but its symptoms can affect a patient's quality of life. Some research hassuggested an association between OAL and Chlamydia psittaci (CP) infection. A group led by Andr\u00e9s Ferreri from the San Raffaele Scientific Institute in Milan, Italy , exam - ined whether doxycycline was an effectivetreatment for OAL. They gave 27 OAL patients athree-week cour se of doxycycline ther apy, regardless of whether they were positive or negative for CP. They assessed lymphomaresponse at 1, 3 and 6 months . The author s found that doxycycline treat- ment caused lymphoma to CP-negative patients . Failur e-free survival at two years in the patients treated with doxycycline was 66%, and 20 of the 27patients (74%) wer e progression free. The responses observed in patients who tested negative to CP may suggest a need for devel- opment of more sensitive methods for detec-tion, and investigation of the potential role ofother doxycycline-sensitive bacteria. According to the authors, doxycycline may be a useful therapy even in patients whereother treatments have failed, and it is a validalternative to chemotherapy and radiationwithout causing the same toxic side-effects.
