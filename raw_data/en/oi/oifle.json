The organization, which employs 300 staff members across Connecticut, New York, and New Jersey, recently attained a whopping 95 percent vaccination rate among its direct care staff in a push to safeguard the health of its clients and employees. Overall, its employee vaccination rate stands at 93 percent. In keeping with Mountainside's unified vision of protecting the community, the majority of its staff received their vaccines as soon as they became available, as early as December. With rising concerns surrounding [new COVID-19 variants](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/variants/about-variants.html?s_cid=11728:%2Bcovid-19%20%2Bvariant:sem.b:p:RG:GM:gen:PTN:FY22), the company mandated vaccination to close the gap and saw a 23 percent increase in the number of staff vaccinated. \"For nearly 20 months, we have been battling the global COVID-19 pandemic and providing critical addiction treatment services to clients at a time they desperately need it. Back in December, we collaborated with the Connecticut Department of Public Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to obtain priority approval to access COVID-19 vaccines, and that same week, we had staff getting vaccinated,\" says [Andre Basso](https://mountainside.com/people/andre-basso/), Chief Executive Officer at Mountainside. \"This decision was based on positive scientific data and public health organizations' endorsement of the COVID-19 vaccine as the key to ending the pandemic. Aside from employees with legal exemptions, all of our direct care staff who were able to receive the vaccine have done so.\" At the start of the pandemic, Mountainside also adapted its programming to accommodate rising health concerns, including the introduction of telehealth services at its outpatient centers across the Northeast and the creation of free, online support groups for individuals and families in recovery. With the success of previously established safety measures combined with high rates of vaccination across the organization, Mountainside is proud to announce that its in-person [Outpatient Services](https://mountainside.com/treatment/outpatient-services/) have reopened. The reintroduction of these life-saving services is intended to support those who prefer face-to-face interactions with a therapist but may not have the flexibility in their busy schedules for a stay in residential treatment. Telehealth services will continue to be available for clients. \"We know that protecting our staff and clients starts with practicing universal precautions, social distancing, and wearing masks on campus, but the evidence is very clear that vaccinations are key for combatting the spread of this virus and keeping our community healthy,\" says Chief Medical Officer [Dr. Randall Dwenger](https://mountainside.com/people/randall-dwenger/).
