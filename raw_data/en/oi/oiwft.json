These include five types of antiviral drugs that are taken as a pill once a day for one year or longer. And there are two types of immune modulator drugs called \"interferon\" that are given as an injection for six months to a year. It's important to know that not everyone needs to be treated. A liver specialist (or a provider who is knowledgeable about hepatitis B) should evaluate your health through a physical exam, blood tests and an imaging study of your liver (ultrasound, FibroScan [Transient Elastography] or CT scan). Then you can discuss together whether you are a good candidate for treatment since the approved drugs are most effective when there are signs of active liver disease. In addition, talk to your provider about [HBV Clinical Trials](/treatment-and-management/clinical-trials/) since there are several new drugs being tested that are available for infected adults. All adults, however, should be seen regularly by a liver specialist (or care provider who is knowledgeable about hepatitis B) whether they are on treatment or not.
