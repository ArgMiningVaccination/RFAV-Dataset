Antimicrobial resistance poses a significant threat to healthcare. Luckily, ultra-microscopic viruses called bacteriophages might hold a solution. Scientists first discovered bacteriophages over 100 years ago. Since then, scientists have developed phage therapies that specifically target and kill harmful bacteria, leaving helpful bacteria untouched. Once abandoned in favor of more recent discoveries using antibiotics, more scientists are revisiting the idea of phage therapy for mitigating bacterial diseases. In this infographic, explore the history of virus-consuming bacteriophages, how they work, and their therapeutic potential.
