Our NoTox BoTox Cosmetic Acupuncture and ATP Facial Rejuvenation treatments are effective, non-toxic methods to slow the signs of aging and brighten your look! If you're not thrilled about injecting botulinum toxin or chemical fillers into your skin, we have the solution. Inner Light Wellness offers all natural facial rejuvenation treatments. If you're interested in an alternative therapy that enhances your beauty from the inside out and you are able to commit to 10-20 treatments, then Cosmetic Acupuncture and ATP Facial Rejuvenation are just the ticket. Cosmetic acupuncture facial rejuvenation is an ancient beauty secret used for over 5,000 years. Emperors and Empresses used it in ancient times as part of their beauty and health regimen. It reduces signs of aging and restores that healthy glow to your face and body. Cosmetic acupuncture needles stimulate facial tissue and increase circulation to your wrinkles and skin so your body produces its own collagen and elastin, reducing current wrinkles and slowing down the production of new ones. The Problem With Fillers and BoTox: NoTox Solutions So rather than working from the outside in, why not work from the inside out? ATP Facial Rejuvenation and Cosmetic Acupuncture stimulate your own body's ability to produce collagen and elastin by re-oxygenating and repairing the skin cells, reducing inflammation, balancing hormones, and restoring overall health. Our treatments can even be used to prepare you for that big event up to the day before as there is no down time or bruising. The result? Longer lasting improvements in elasticity and facial skin tone, long term benefits to your health and well-being, leading to a natural \"all over\" radiant beauty. Full Cosmetic 45 Minute Acupuncture Sessions (10 Minimum) Have you ever noticed how beautiful people look when they exude health? With Cosmetic Acupuncture, you will receive whole body treatments to address your overall wellness or any underlying health condition, as well as specific points on the face to correct problem areas. Cosmetic Acupuncture promotes the body's own ability to produce collagen and elastin production in the face, which helps to lift and tone sagging skin, jowls, eyelids, and decreases wrinkles in the forehead, lip, eyes, neck, and mouth. Treating your entire system results in inner radiance, improved stamina, enhanced immunity and more. Acupuncture Facial Rejuvenation sessions can be combined with ATP Facial Rejuvenation as part of our NoTox BoTox Plan. If you choose this combination plan, your ATP session precedes your acupuncture treatment. What is a Cosmetic Acupuncture Session Like? Your acupuncture treatment is customized to your unique health concerns. We balance the body to correct the underlying issues then use tiny, hair thin facial needles to address lines and wrinkles. Our advanced acupuncture techniques use fewer needles. Less is more in acupuncture because it focuses all the energy into the areas we are targeting. This means more patient comfort and less time on the table. If you are afraid of needles, we have needle free options too! Benefits of Cosmetic Acupuncture 45 Minute (10 Minimum) - Treats Underlying Health Problems or Pain - Enhances Immunity - Balances Hormones - Reduces Stress, Anxiety, Depression - Treats Rosacea & Acne - Lifts and Tones Problem Areas of the Face, Neck, and Jowls - Reduces Fine Lines - Fills in Marionette Lines and Deep Forehead Wrinkles (these do not completely disappear) - Reduces Puffiness and Under Eye Circles - Lifts Hooded, Drooping Eyelids ATP Resonance BioTherapy 45 Minute Facial Rejuvenation (10 Minimum) Wow! My patients are impressed with needle-free ATP Facial Rejuvenation. Why? Because it promotes cellular repair, going deeper than Cosmetic Acupuncture alone. Although it can be used as a stand alone treatment (important for people who HATE needles!), when combined with Acupuncture Facial Rejuvenation, your results are doubled in 10 visits. Low level electrical current (micro-current) is applied to problem areas of the face using specialized devices to deliver healing frequencies to the facial muscles, skin of the face, and body. 90% of people do not feel the stimulating current. Of the 10% who do (I'm one of them), none report it being unpleasant. After your treatment, your skin looks immediately radiant and 'awake'. My patients report increased energy that lasts for several days after your treatment. If you choose our entire NoTox BoTox Plan, the ATP therapy session is immediately followed by Acupuncture Facial Rejuvenation. What is an ATP Resonance BioTherapy Session Like? You will be lying face up on a padded massage table that can also be heated if you prefer. Then we use specific devices to deliver the current as follows: Stim Pads are applied to deliver current to the overall bodily system. This stimulates deep cellular healing, rebalancing the nervous system and body. iProbes deliver the current to individual muscles of the face to tone sagging muscles and release those that are tight. Facial Gua Sha drains lymphatic fluid from under the eyes and the jowls. Gua Sha sculpts the jaw line and reduces puffiness and dark circles from under the eyes. This is different from traditional jade tools used in acupuncture since it is connected to the ATP Resonance machine and delivers current while removing excess lymph fluid. Facial Mask using our exclusive HA Serum which has been treated with bio frequencies to match your own body's cellular resonance. Unlike traditional facial masks, our ATP mask is also attached to the machine so is delivering low level current to drive the serum deep into the cells. This is the icing on the cake for stimulating collagen production. Benefits of ATP Facial Rejuvenation - Immediately Brightens Your Skin - Reduces Fine Lines and Crow's Feet - Lifts Sagging Cheeks and Jowls - Smooths Forehead - Lifts Drooping Eyelids - Reduces Under Eye Dark Circles, and Puffiness - Lessens Deep Marionette Lines - Decreases Dark Spots (over time) - Reduces Redness - Evens Your Skin Tone - Increases Energy - Hydrates the Skin - Enhances Overall Well Being Who Can Benefit From ATP Facial Rejuvenation and Acupuncture?

NoTox BoTox has such an array of benefits beyond reducing facial wrinkles, toning the face, and promoting even skin tone. Because we are using a combination of powerful acupuncture techniques with the addition of ATP frequencies that benefit the body and nervous system, we are restoring your whole system to a more youthful state. My patients rave about the lasting steady energy, mental well being, and elimination of 'brain fog'. They're more productive due to clearer thinking and improved stamina. This is our most comprehensive plan and produces stunning results within 30 days like the above photos taken at treatment 5 using our NoTox BoTox Plan. Facial Cupping Facial Cupping is an add-on to any of our plans. Silicone cups are used to drain stagnant fluids and reduce puffiness. Cupping also improves circulation, and bring nutrients to the face resulting in an immediate youthful glow. Facial cupping is gentle and leaves no marks. The cups come in a variety of shapes specially designed for your face. After applying therapeutic oil, the cup is gently suctioned for a few seconds to stimulate individual acupuncture points. The cups are then gently moved along the acupuncture meridians and over deep wrinkles to bring micro-circulation to the surface. They are then moved down the neck to drain lymphatic fluid and stimulate blood flow. Cupping brings collagen to the surface, drains the sinuses, and lymph, and can relieve TMJ and sinus headaches. LED Light Therapy LED Light Therapy stimulates collagen production, which reduces fine lines and wrinkles. Certain color lights have been shown to decrease inflammation as well as eliminate acne-causing bacteria to improve skin clarity and balance redness from rosacea. LED means light emitting diode. It uses varied spectrum infrared lights to treat different skin problems. For example: amber light stimulates collagen and elastin, red light increases circulation, and blue light kills bacteria. As you lie under the LED light panels, you'll wear protective eye gear and feel a warm sensation over your face. After a few minutes, most patients feel very relaxed. Treatment time is up to 15 minutes. Relax under the lights! How Long Does It Last? Unlike fillers and BoTox, the benefits of NoTox Cosmetic Acupuncture and ATP Resonance BioTherapy treatments last for longer periods of time when you keep up with occasional maintenance visits. You save money over time because the collagen produced by your own body is being maintained rather than trying to fight the inevitability of aging. You will achieve a more natural look, with less wrinkles and sagging, improved overall health, and no side effects. With our all natural therapies, your health is never at risk and the cost is minimal in the long run since you will not have to keep repeating treatments as often. Lastly, you will never have to worry about the long-term adverse side effects that are as yet unknown from injecting your face with chemical fillers and toxins.
