Virginia Lawson, PhD, talks about a new program coming to Upstate called the [Schwartz Compassionate Rounds](http://www.theschwartzcenter.org/supporting-caregivers/schwartz-center-rounds/), designed to promote the importance of healthcare professionals listening to one another to enhance patient care. Inclusive ~ Interfaith ~ Integrated Spirituality is recognized as a factor that contributes to health in many persons. The concept of spirituality is found in all cultures and societies. It is expressed in an individual's search for ultimate meaning through participation in religion and/or belief in God, family, naturalism, rationalism, humanism and the arts. All these factors can influence how patients and health care professionals perceive health and illness and how they interact with one another.
