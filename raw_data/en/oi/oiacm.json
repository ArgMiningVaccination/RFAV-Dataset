As an empath, I am acutely aware of the suffering of others around me. This often left me feeling frustrated, as so many people were not open to healing. So in order to be able to help many more people, I decided to learn another way of healing. Treating clients with herbs and diet is an extension of my healing skills for me, another way to help those who are suffering. Vibrational healing is a way to bring the body back to health through increasing its vibration. As proven through quantum physics, everything is in fact energy, vibrating at different rates. It is this vibrational rate that makes things - and us - physical. The natural state of the body is perfect health, but our modern way of living doesn't allow for this. Our food no longer contains as many vitamins and minerals due to modern farming methods, and is often contaminated with chemicals. Our water contains more chemicals than most people are aware of. We eat, drink and breathe in chemicals, as pollution is everywhere and brings down our immune system. Stress, tension and lack of sleep are common and major problems in this modern way of life. All of these bring the body's vibration down, but fear is worst of all. Most problems cause fear and worry (negative thoughts), which are guaranteed to bring the body's vibration - and its immune system - down. (Gerald Green always told patients to try to be positive, as it's been proven that positive thought raises the immune system by 10%) The reason for this is that the body is directed by the mind. When the mind is burdened with fears and worries, these are transferred to the body and will eventually manifest as illness. Healing cannot stop you worrying, but it can give your body a vibrational boost to start its natural healing process. You can also help this process along yourself, with meditation. (see: [Meditation for Health](https://geraldgreenherbaltreatments.wordpress.com/the-holistic-approach/meditation-for-health/)) Meditation has been proven to relieve stress, create a deep sense of wellbeing and is an invaluable tool for healing the body and mind. In my experience healing doesn't combine well with orthodox medicine, as the chemicals they use are foreign to the body and lower its vibration. I was for instance able to treat a (lymphatic) cancer patient successfully with healing before and after, but not during chemotherapy treatment. When the patient uses herbal treatment however, I can treat them with healing at any time and often speed up their recovery considerably. The combination of herbal treatment, healing and meditation is a Holistic approach, as it supports the patient's healing process from every possible angle by treating body, mind and spirit. The herbs will treat the patient's physical illness,while the patient takes resposibility for a healthy diet and meditation. Healing increases the body's vibration and boosts its natural healing powers. In my experience this combination ensures the fastest possible recovery. I never pressurise people to have healing and always wait to be asked, but I'd like clients to know that healing is available. Clients who live in other parts of the world won't miss out, as I can send healing at any distance. A FREE HEALING SESSION IS INCLUDED IN EVERY CONSULTATION VISIT. "}
