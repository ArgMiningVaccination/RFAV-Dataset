Acupuncture is an ancient treatment dating back to 1000s of years. One theory on how it works is that the needling process stimulates nerve fibers that then transmits signals to the spinal cord and brain which then releases hormones responsible for making us feel better. Some studies using brain images confirm that acupuncture increases pain threshold, which may explain why it produces long-term pain relief and improves overall health. How to Get a Referral for Acupuncture You will have to get a referral to the [Pain Management Clinic](/Health-Services/Specialty-Care/Pain-Management-Clinic) from your provider. The referral must specifically state that it's for acupuncture and provide the reason acupuncture is recommended.
