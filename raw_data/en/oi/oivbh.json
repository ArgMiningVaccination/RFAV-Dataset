Anderson, D.V.M., M.P.H., \"World Veterinary Yea r\" drawing to a close, we have an opportunity to reflec t on the contributions of the veterinary profession to the One Health move-ment. With the theme \"250 years of veterinary sci-ence in the service of ani mal and human health\" and the slogan \"Vet for health, Vet for food, Vet for the planet,\" the Vet2011 initiative has celebrated the 250 th anniversary of the ve terinary profession through hundreds of international events over the course of the year. In addition, t he veterinary pr ofession is concurrently celebrating the eradication of rinderpest, a devastating disease of cattle, which although not zoonotic had significant impacts on animal and public health. Here we will briefly summarize the Vet2011 initiative as well as the One Health sign ificance of the eradi- cation of rinderpest. Claude Bourgelat is credited with establishing the first veteri nary school in Lyon, France in 1761, which resulted in the formal establishmen t of the veterinary profession. In addition, he is r ecognized as a pioneer in comp arative medicine, ap- preciating that the study of animal diseases could inform our u nderstanding of dis- eases in humans (which is now w ell recognized in the One Health movement). In light of the contributions of Cla ude Bourgelat to the veterinar y profession, multiple organizations within the French ve terinary community proposed t hat 2011 be named \"World Veterinary Year \" in honor of this 250th anniversary. The founding members of the Vet2011 initiative include the World Organization for Animal Health, or OIE; the Fr ench Ministry in Charge of Agriculture; the Higher Counc il of the Order of Veterinari- ans; The French National Veterinary Unions' Federation; the French Academ y; ouse; and the National Vet- erinary Services School. Since its inception, hundreds of international associate and corresponding members as well as institutional and business partners have promoted and contributed to the success of World Veterinary Year. The main objective of Vet2011 has been \"to improve public awar eness and remind policymakers everywhere i n the world that our profession has been serving humankind for 250 years\" and tha t \"modern veterinarians are not only animal doc- tors and animal welfare advoca tes, they are also key public hea lth stakeholders be- One One One Health Newsletter Health Newsletter Health Newsletter A quarterly newsletter highlighting the inte rconnectedness of animal and human health The One Health Newsletter is a collaborative effort by scientists and health profes sionals from the following organizations: Palm Beach County Health Department Florida Department of Health University of Florida Kahn/Kaplan/Monath/ Woodall One Health Team http://www.onehealthinitiative.com .

Although the international clo sing ceremony for World Veter inary Year will be held in October 2011 at the World Veterinary Congr ess in Cape Town, South Africa, events have been scheduled through the end of the year. One of the primary motivations fo r establishing the first veter inary school in France was to prevent cattle di seases such as rinderpest, makin g the celebration of its eradication during the 250th anniversary even more moment ous. Rinderpest is related to measles, canine distemper, peste -des-petits ruminants, and s everal viruses found in marine mammals. Affected anima ls developed fever, discharge s from the eyes and nose, erosions of the oral muc osa, diarrhea, and death. Althou gh not zoonotic, in its severest form rinderp est could kill 95% or more of infected ani mals and therefore threatened rural livelihoods and food security in affected nati ons. Rinderpest is thought to have orig inated as far back as the dom estication of cattle in Asia, and has affected cattle and wildlife in Asia, A frica, and Europe. Al- though considered an \"ancient enemy,\" implementation of disease control and eradi- cation principles in Europe in the 1700s (e.g., slaughter, move ment restrictions, burial of animals in lime, inspection of meat) resulted in the conside ration of rinderpest as a disease of developing countries by the early 20th century. Subsequent eradication in these areas largely depended on t he discovery of an effective r inderpest vaccine that worked well in tropica l countries, as well as the adoption of m ass vaccination and sur- veillance programs conducted by local, national, regional, and international organiza- tions. After multiple regio nal efforts throughout the 20th century, the Global Rinderpest Eradication Programme (GREP) was established in 1994 to coordin ate these efforts to achieve eradication. The OIE cert ified the global eradication of rinderpest in 2010, and a resolution declaring the world free of rinderpest was ado pted at the 37th UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) conference in June 2011 . Please see the GREP website ( http://www.fao.org/ag/againfo/p rogrammes/en/grep/home.html ) for more detailed information about the eradication program, as wel l as interviews and spotlights on the many \"faces be hind rinderpest eradication.\" The following FAO me- dia release also contains a time -lapse map of the \"retreat\" of rinderpest, as well as an interactive timeline regarding er adication efforts since the 17 00s: http://www.fao.org/news/sto ry/0/item/35548/icode/en/ .

Schwabe, DVM, MPH, ScD originally coined the term \"One Medicine\" Page 3 One Health Newsletter Volume 4 Issue 4 In the spirit of One Health, the eradication of rinderpest is a major animal and public health accomplishment. Its eradication improves food se curity, trade and pros- perity, access to pas toral communities, and public health in pr eviously affected coun- tries. It is fitting that we cel ebrate this feat, the first er adication of an animal disease and only the second disease to be eradicated by human efforts ( after smallpox), in the same year that we celebrate the 250th anniversary of the establishment of the veteri- nary profession. The veterinary a nd One Health communities sho uld certainly take this opportunity to reflect on the contributions of Claude Bour gelat as well as the count- less individuals, from village l eaders to directors of internat ional organizations, that contributed to the eradi cation of rinderpes t. As World Veterin ary Year draws to a close, may we all be inspired to continue serving both animal a nd public health, look- ing forward to future accomplis hments and advancements through improved One Health collaborations.

Who Coined the Term \"One Medicine\"? Bruce Kaplan, DVM and Cheryl \"One Medicine\" term and crystallized the concept in the 20th century. A re-examination of historically valid references appears to ve rify that the American veterinarian, Calvi n W. Schwabe, DVM, MPH, ScD originally coined the term \"One Medicine\" and represented i t to designate the concept asso ciated therewith (4, 5). Among other reference sources, Dr. Schwabe demonstrated how statements and actions taken by the great 19th century German physician Rudolf Virchow, MD, the father of cellular pathology, bol stered the case for Schwabe's original \"One Medicine concept\" propositi on (5). Dr. Virchow said, \"between animal and human medicine there are no dividing lines--nor should there be .\" (9) A literature review o f Dr. William Osler's writings (6, 7) plus two prominent bi- ographies (2, 3) found no personal usage of the term \"One Medic ine\", but his alliance with veterinary medicine and vete rinarians is historically unqu estioned, at least during his early teaching and medical ca reer in the 19th century. Acco rding to all available documented references, Dr. Osler would have supported Dr. Schwabe's proposal hav- ing been strongly influenced by his teacher and pathology mento r Dr. Virchow (who most certainly would have concurred). Known as the father of modern medi cine and the father of intern al medicine, the great Canadian physician Si r William Osler was a 19th and e arly 20th century practitioner of modern day \"One Medicine-One Health\" collaborat ive principles. One example: while teaching at the M ontreal Veterinary College, Dr. Osler organized a sig- nificant study of parasites in the pork supply of Montreal with one of his most brilliant veterinary students, Albert W. C lement. The two concluded, corr ectly, that cooking of pork was the best protection against humans contracting parasit ic illnesses when in- Calvin Schwabe Dr Rudolf Virchow, the father of cellular pathology, said \"between animal and human medi-cine there are no di- viding lines--nor should there be.\" One Health recog- nizes that humans do not exist in isola-tion, but are part of a larger whole, a living ecosystem, and that activities of each member affect the others.

Dr. Clement, a v eterinarian, l ater became a President of the United States Veterinary Medi cal Association, now the American Veterin ary Medical Associa- tion or AVMA. (1, 2, 3). Several readers of the One Health Initiative website have asked how the mis- leading assumption developed that Dr. William Osler coined the term. It appears that this issue originated from a 2000 publication on page 231 (8) s tating \"The phrase \"One Medicine\" is attributed to Sir William Osler who studied with V irchow and worked with other veterinarians and physicia ns who were involved in both me dical branches.\" No reference for this assumption was cited although one other refe rence was noted rela- tive to Virchow's appreciation fo r veterinary medicine (9) vis- \u00e0-vis human medicine. Regrettably, this uns ubstantiated comment has been perpetuated since in other One Health publications. Today, \"One Medicine\" is commonl y referred to as \"One Health\" w orldwide. This terminology change occurred during the first decade of the 21st century. \"One Health\" is the evolution of the earlier used term \"One Medicine ,\" which historically im- plied the crossing over between veterinarians and physicians. O ne Health recognizes that humans do not exist in isol ation, but are a part of a larg er whole, a living ecosys- tem, and that activities of eac h member affect the others. Thus , One Health considers health as a whole: that of human s, animals, and the environment they exist on. References: 1. Kahn LH, Kaplan B, Steele JH.

Growing ecotourism has increased inter- actions between hu-mans and wild ani- mals, intensifying the chance for dis-ease transmission. Page 5 One Health Newsletter Volume 4 Issue 4 Fatal Respiratory Infections in Endangered Gorillas Are Linked to Human Contact Daniela Hernandez, PhD New Study Indicates that Ecotourism May be Contributing to the Decline of Mountain Gorillas in African Preserves In a study published online this week in the journal Emerging Infectious Dis- eases , a team of researchers report tha t a virus that causes respira tory disease in hu- mans infected and contributed to the deaths of mountain gorilla s in Virunga National Park. This finding raises questions about the safety of ecotourism for endangered spe- cies. The study, which appears in the April issue of the journal, was conducted by scientists at Columbia University's Center for Infection and Immunity (CII), Roche 454 Life Sciences , the UC Davis Wildlife Health Center, and the Mountain Gorilla Veteri- nary Project , a US-based non-profit organization. Mountain gorillas (Gorilla beringei beringei) live primarily in Rwanda, Uganda, and the Democratic Republic of C ongo in Bwindi Impenetrable Nat ional Park and Virunga National Park, which houses about a third of the world' s remaining gorilla population. Despite international efforts to protect this endan gered species, there are currently fewer than 800 livi ng mountain gorillas in the world. Now, this study, which focuses on an outbreak of respiratory di sease in the Hirwa group of mountain gorillas in 2009, suggests that these a nimals may also be susceptible to human pathogens. In fectious diseases, especially respiratory ones, are the second leading cause of sudden deaths among mountain gorill as, after poaching. Growing ecotourism has increas ed interactions between humans an d wild ani- mals living in these parks, int ensifying the chance for disease transmission. While ecotourism has heightened awareness of the need to safeguard en dangered species, world travel also has the potent ial to quickly spread disease. Local authorities have recently tried to reduce animals' exposu re to potentially harmful pathogens by limiting t he number of tourists visiting w ildlife parks and requir- ing visitors to wear protective masks. Despite these efforts, t he frequency and severity of respiratory disease outbreaks among gorillas have been on th e rise. In fact, of the 12 gorillas in the Hirwa group, 11 showed classic symptoms of r espiratory infection, including coughing, runny nose , and lethargy. Two of these gor illas, an adult female and her male infant, died. Using state-of-the-art molecul ar methods, CII researchers found evidence of respiratory tract infection wit h human metapneumovirus (HMPV) a nd bacterial pneu- monia in the female's lungs, throat, and nose. Further tests confirmed that H MPV found in the lungs of sick go rillas was closely related to strains cir culating in South Africa, over 1, 000 miles away, suggesting that tourists may have carri ed the virus into the parks. 'Pure' HMPV infections typicall y result only in mild damage to the respiratory system, suggesting that an intera ction between HMPV and bacteri al pneumonia may have been the cause of death. Thi s observation is consistent wi th other studies that have shown that respiratory vir uses like HMPV and H1N1, can mak e hosts more sus- \"We usually think of viruses as jumping from wildlife to hu- mans, but what we often don't realize is that this is a two-way highway.\" Page 6 One Health Newsletter Volume 4 Issue 4 ceptible to opportunistic i nfections, like pneumonia.

What You Need to Know Ab out Armadillos and Leprosy W. J. Loughry, PhD There has been a recent flurry of media interest about the link between arma- dillos and hum an cases of lepr osy in the Unit ed States. Aside from humans, the nine- banded armadillo ( Dasypus novemcinctus ) is the only occurring infections with Mycobacterium leprae , the causative agent in pro- ducing leprosy. there ar e 21 species of armadillo fou nd in various parts of Latin America, the nine-banded ar madillo is the only one found in the U.S. (note also that none of these other species h as ever tested positive for i nfection with M. leprae in the wild). The reason for the recent media attention stems from a paper p ublished by Truman et al. in the New England Journal of Medicine this spring (vol. 364:1626- 1633). They showed t hat the strain of M. leprae infecting armadillo s was genetically identical to that found in indigen ous human case s of leprosy in the U.S. This was in- terpreted as strong evidence tha t leprosy is a zoonotic disease , and that nine-banded armadillos may re present an important sou rce of infection for h umans. Interestingly, earlier genetic work by Monot et al. (2005, Science 308:1040-1042) showed that the strain of M. leprae found in armadillos was not from the New World. As armadillos are strictly New World animals, the implication was that they were probably exposed to the bacterium subsequent to the coloni zation of the Americas by Eur opeans and their Afri- can slaves. Thus, it seems likely transmission of infection ha s gone in both directions: from human to armadillo, and from armadillo to human. From a public health perspective , are the links between armadil los, humans, and leprosy a major cause for co ncern? Generally speaking, the answer is no. There are several reasons for this. F irst, leprosy is a relatively r are disease. Even in popula- tions of armadillos where infecti on is present, prevalence typi cally ranges from about 5-20%. Not only that, but infecti on is not present in many pop ulations. Although nine- banded armadillos are currently f ound across the entire souther n United States, from Florida to west Texas, infection is largely confined to a narro w strip along the west Jim Loughry with armadillo Photomicrograph of Myco- bacterium leprae taken from a leprosy skin lesion (CDC) While the overall risk to humans of con- tracting leprosy from an armadillo is low, certain precautions are advisable. The simplest way to eliminate the poten- tial for infection is to discourage individu- als from hunting and eating armadillos. Page 7 One Health Newsletter Volume 4 Issue 4 side of the Mississippi River and the Gulf of Mexico coast from Louisiana to south Texas. Thus, most people are unl ikely to encounter an infected armadillo. Second, leprosy is a treatable disease an d many people are not suscepti ble to infection. Con- sequently, few people are likely to become infected and those t hat are can be easily helped. Finally, it appears cas ual contact with an infected ar madillo is unlikely to gen- erate infection. M. leprae requires cool temperatures (such as found in the extremities of humans) to propagate. Nine- banded armadillo s have one of th e lowest metabolic rates reported for any mammal . Because of this, and the result ing low body tempera- ture of the animals, infection with M. leprae is systemic, spreading through many of the internal organs. Infected armad illos may shed bacteria via the respiratory tract, but it seems that routine handling does not usually generate sufficien t exposure to lead to infection. While the overall risk to humans o f contracting leprosy from an armadillo is low, certain precaut ions are advisable. A s just mentioned, bec ause infection occurs internally, there is no way to identify an infected animal from external symptoms. Thus, persons wishing to minimiz e their risk should avoid expos ure to any and all ar- madillos. Although the evidence i s mixed, some studies have re ported a link between human cases of leprosy and expo sure to armadillos. Usually, th is involved fairly inti- mate contact by individuals that were killing and consuming the animals. Obviously, the simplest way to eliminate t he potential for infection is to discourage individuals from hunting and eatin g armadillos. Short o f that, certainly o ne should recommend wearing gloves when there is any possibility of coming into con tact with the body fluids of an animal. Finally, because i nfected armadillos may shed ba cteria from the respira- tory tract, the possibility exists that they may contaminate so il within their burrows and in areas where they forage. At p resent, it is not clear how li kely such a scenario might be. Nonetheless, individuals wis hing to reduce the potential f or exposure should con- sider avoiding working in soils utilized by armadillos (or at l east not without gloves). To conclude, it is important to mention that we do not know exa ctly how M. leprae is transmitted in a ny situation, i.e., fr om armadillo to armad illo, from armadillo to human (and vice versa), or from human to human. Thus, recommen dations about ways to minimize the risk of cont racting leprosy from an armadi llo must be viewed as best guesses. Nonetheless , even though the ri sk is quite low, the available evidence does indicate that leprosy is a zoonosis. Con sequently, indivi duals experiencing con- sistent contact with nine-banded armadillos should be made awar e of that fact, and alerted to ways to minimize thei r chances of acquiring infectio n.

As the field is comprehensive, its effective leadership is pr ofoundly complex, frequently controversial, and in variably in need of a wide rang e of individual capacities and initiatives. Many of our great environmental health leaders have been dedicated individuals who have achieved em inence not because they had the right pedigrees or belonged to the right organizations, but because they had the r ight vision, the right information, and the right l eadership at the right time. That is clearly true of some o f the icons in the overarching field of public health. Lemuel Shattuck was a pub lisher, Edwin Chadwick was a l awyer, Charles E. A. Winslow and William Thompson Sedgwick were categorized as sa nitarians, and Albert Lasker was an advertising specialist. As time progresses , the mantle of public health leadership continues to fa ll to those who are perceived as \"having earned it.\" The commonly accepted definition of environmental health is t hat promulgated in 1992 by the Committee on the Future of Environmental Health (1). Following wide- spread peer review, the committ ee noted that \"Environmental hea lth and protection is the art and science of protecti ng against environmental factors that may adversely im- pact human health or the ecologic al balances essential to long- term human health and environmental quality. Such fact ors include, but are not limit ed to: air, food, and water contaminants; radiation; toxic c hemicals; disease vectors; safe ty hazards; and habitat alterations.\" That definition remains a ha llmark of the field. It does, ho wever, call for state- ments of vision that can set ou t standards for worldwide commit ment to an enhanced environment : We should envision a world in which environmental health measu res contribute substantially to preventing di sease and disability, as well as reducing health-care costs. We should envision a world in which environmental health is co nsidered to be an important entitlemen t for the common good. We should envision a world in which environmental health probl ems are meas- ured and defined prior to designing and implementing control me asures.

We should envision a world in which ecological considerations a re understood to be components of environmental health because, in the long run, a deteriorated envi- ronment is a threat to publ ic health and the economy.

NEON (The National Ecological Observatory Network) Yuri Springer, PhD Recent decades have seen profound changes in the interactions b etween hu- man populations and natural ecos ystems. Through processes such as climate change, shifting land use practices, and the spread of non-native speci es, humans have dra- matically altered the geographic distributions of numerous orga nisms and the structure and dynamics of most, if not all , of the earth's ecosystems. A t the same time, urban expansion and globalization have dramatically increased connect ivity between human populations and these ecosystems, resulting in more frequent an d novel interactions. Examples include probable links be tween the emergence of a vari ety of zoonotic pathogens and the spread of human populations into wildland are as, as well as chang- ing patterns of resource use (e.g. logging, agriculture, huntin g)1. While these unfolding feedbacks between anthropogenic, environm ental, and ecological processes will often be complex and difficult to exp lain and predict, their consequences for biodiversity conservation, ecosystem productiv ity and function, and human health will, in many cases, be dramatic and perhaps catas trophic.

We are participants in a natural experiment of unprecedented scale and importance, and t he National Ecologi- cal Observatory Netw ork is being created to collect the data th at will allow us to under- stand and respond to the outcomes.

Head- quartered in Boulder, CO and fund ed by the National Science Fou ndation (NSF)4, the NEON project will comprise a net work of 62 sampling sites, dist ributed across the range of climatic zones and vegetation communities found within the United States and Puerto Rico5. For example, candidate sites to represent the \"southeast dom ain,\" which contains the southern porti ons of the Gulf Coast states, half of Georgia and South Carolina, and all of Flori da except for the state's south ern tip, include the Uni- versity of Florida's Ordway-S wisher the ture Conservancy's Disney Wilderness Preserve7 south of Orlando, FL, and the Uni- versity of Georgia's Jones Ecological Research Center8 southwest of Albany, GA. At each site, NEON will use standardized methods to collect a wide range of environ- mental and biological informati on over a thirty-year period. A fter several years in the conception and planning stages, NEON received construction fund ing from the NSF in August of 2011 to begin building t he observatory's physical inf rastructure, a process expected to last five to seven ye ars. In the months ahead, NEON scientists will con- tinue to formulate, refine, and field test sampling protocols t o collect a broad suite of ecological data that will include measurement of the disease pr evalence of a variety of zoonotic pathogens. Three sampling approaches will be combined to achieve NEON's ge neral ob- jectives. First, ground -based sampling at each site will inclu de passive, sensor-based measurements of a range of abiot ic parameters (e.g., meteorolog ical conditions, aquatic nutrient concentrations, s oil carbon ,and water fluxes) as well as active, techni- cian-based monitoring of a suite of biological phenomena associ ated with microbial, insect, bird, small mammal, and plant populations. Second, air borne measurements will be obtained from remote-sens ing instrumentation (e.g., spe ctrometry, LiDAR) aboard small aircraft that will fly over each site multiple tim es per year. Finally, infor- mation from ground-based and airborne sampling will be integrat ed with data from Photo by Tyler Jones The synthesis of diverse ecological, environmental, and social data across multiple spatiotempo- ral scales, facilitated by the use of stan- dardized sampling protocols and infra- structure, will allow NEON to provide un- precedented insights into processes of en- vironmental changes, their mechanistic underpinnings, and their ecological con- sequences. Page 11 One Health Newsletter Volume 4 Issue 4 large external datasets such a s those associated with NASA's MO DIS satellite9 and the US census10. The synthesis of diverse ecolo gical, environmental, and social data across multiple spatiotemporal scales , facilitated by the use of stand ardized sampling proto- cols and infrastructure, will allow NEON to provide unprecedent ed insights into proc- esses of environmental changes, their mech anistic underpinnings , and their ecological consequences. All data generated by NEON monitoring and data a nalyses, as well as biological specimens archived as part of ground-based sampling, will be open-access and freely available to researchers, educators, and the public. As mentioned previously, novel and emerging feedbacks between h uman populations and natural ecosystems , and changes in connectivity between the two, will likely have important consequences for issues related to public health. Changes in the physical environment, such as i ncreased frequency and/or magnit ude of heat waves and extreme storms, raise human risks associated with physiolog ical stress and dam- age to habitat and infrastructure . Changing environmental cond itions may facilitate geographic range expansions of disease vectors and accelerate r eplication and/or transmission rates o f pathogens. Modulation of the structure o f biological communi- ties, including reductions in biodiversity and increased relati ve abundance of \"generalist\" species or those co mmensal with humans, could have profound conse- quences for the epidemiology of infectious diseases. In recognition of these and other potential outcomes NEON will collect data and archive biological samples re lated to mosquito-, tick-, and small mammal-borne diseases. Using methods including CO 2 light trapping, drag sampling, and Sherman live trapping, NEON will quantify the prevalence of pathogens s uch as West Nile virus, Lyme disease bacteria, and hant aviruses at select study sites. Co-location of disease sampling with the full suite of N EON observatory measurements w ill permit the empiri- cal consideration of a broad array of potential biotic and abio tic drivers of disease dy- namics, and the 30-year duration of sampling will elucidate tem poral patterns of infec- tion prevalence spanning intra-annual and multi-decadal time sc ales. Working with partners in academic research ins titutions and state and federa l public health agencies to refine sampling and analytica l protocols and contextualize r esults, NEON data will provide novel and powerful insi ghts into the dynamics of infect ious disease in our rap- idly changing environment.

Page 12 One Health Newsletter Volume 4 Issue 4 Strengthening One Health Approaches Through Tabletop Simulation Exercises Katinka de Balogh, Sigfrido Burgos, Morgane Dominguez, and Juan Lubroth The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) understands the One Health approach as a collaborative, cross-sectoral, multidisciplinary mechanism to ad-dress threats and reduce risks of infectious dis- eases at the animal-human-ecosystem interface at international, regional, national, and local levels. It strategically builds on the lessons learned from, and achievements of, the re- sponses to H5N1 avian influenza and H1N1 epizootics. It is ackn owledged as a feasible and viable model t o address the multidi- mensional challenges that are rapi dly evolving in the world. Am ong the tools within One Health, simulation exercise s are strongly re commended owing to its applicability and usefulness in real emergency situations. The Food and Agriculture Organization, with the financial suppo rt of the United States Department for Inte rnational Development (USAID), and in close col- laboration with the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Hea lth Protection Agency of the United Kingdom, has developed tabletop and field simulation exercises for H5N1 avian influenza and is presently developing a number o f simulation exercises for other zoonotic diseases. Bu ilding on these experiences in o rganizing tabletop simulation exercises, FAO has developed a toolbox which can be provided on request to assist countries with the organization of such exercises. In addition, FAO can pro- vide a series of training course s on how to organize tabletop s imulation exercises. The aim of tabletop simulation ex ercises is to preemptively ide ntify the strengths and weaknesses of a country's contingency plans. They also serve to exam- ine the communication, coordination, and cooperation between di fferent sectors in- volved in disease prevention, detection, and control in animal and human populations. A wide variety of participants from local, national, regional, and international institu- tions attend these exercises beca use of concerns that high impa ct diseases could be introduced into countries and territories with potentially deva stating consequences on food security, animal and human health, national stability, eco nomic progress, social development, and rural an d urban livelihoods. To give one example, between 2003 and August 2, 2011, a total o f 63 coun- tries and territories throughou t the world have experienced out breaks of avian influ- enza A subtype H5N1 (H5N1 AI) i n domestic poultry and/or wild b irds. During this timeframe the cumulative number of confirmed human cases of H5N 1 AI reported to WHO is 562. Of these, 329 resulte d in death. The H5N1 AI case i llustrates how a viru- lent infectious disease can spr ead across countries and contine nts. Cognizant of these hazards and threats, the internat ional agencies responsible for public and animal health have stressed the importanc e of disease surveillance in animal and human populations, along with strengthening of capacities in relation to animal and human health emergency preparedness and response. Tabletop simulation exercises allow testing, in a cost-effective m anner, of the available contingen cy and emergency plans. Table top simulations can be followed by onsite farm or field exercises. Prevention of emer- gence and cross- border spread of hu- man and animal in- fectious diseases is a global public good that benefits all coun- tries, peoples, and generations. Page 13 One Health Newsletter Volume 4 Issue 4 Institutional activities, man agement, responses , and collaborat ions are assessed while the participants navigate throug h the different sessions. One m ay ask: how are these simulations run? A realistic scenario adapted to local conditions is developed w ith knowledge- able local focal points. The two-day exercise is organized in a large meeting room fit- ted with working group tables and is attended by 40 to 50 parti cipants that are divided into four groups, eac h with a facilitator. All participants rec eive the same outbreak sce- nario that runs over four session s with related questions. A la rge map is placed on a central table to enable better vi sualization of the locations o f disease outbreaks, to grasp a geographic understandi ng of affected areas, and to illu strate the logistics re- quired to implement measures. In addition, some of the discussi ons take place around the map and this was found to fost er discussion and interactivi ty between the different groups especially since different professionals \"see\" the probl em through their specific viewpoints. During plenary sessi ons, the groups exchange their findings and deci- sions. Mock press conferences ar e held for participants to resp ond to challenging questions posed by participants ro le-playing as interviewers an d journalists. This en- ables the participants to practice risk communication in a safe environment. Additionally, macro-level tabletop simulations can be followed by micro-level farm or field exercises. The la tter encompasses on-site work in farms, with on-farm activities such as wearing protective clothing, gloves, goggles , and boots; simulating culling and disposal of carcasses ; cleaning and disinfection; d econtaminating animal yards; communicating via radio with authorities; and yellow-tap ing and quarantining of premises, among other tasks. These simulation exercises contrib ute to the strengthen- ing of national emergency prep aredness and response capacities. The many lessons learned during these exercises should be easily adapted and app lied to other emer- gencies and diseases as needed. A ll exercises are held in the l anguage of the country where it is taking place along with simultaneous translations o f the plenary sessions and the mock press conferences. Transnational economic and cooper ation bodies as well as animal and human health agencies must recognize that organizing tabletop simulat ion exercises on zoonotic and other high impact disease outbreaks is an effectiv e tool for improving local, national, regional, and international levels of prepared ness and response. Em- phasis must be given to the fac t that prevention of emergence a nd cross-border spread of human and animal infectious diseases is a global publ ic good that benefits all countries, peoples, and generations. The reports that resul t from these exercises help countries identify and analyze the strengths, weaknesses, partners, and needs that currently exist, and for t hese to be addressed by national authorities for enhancing the country's preparedness and response capacities. In 2010, FAO assisted Mauritania and Ukraine with integrated simulation exer- cises for highly pathogenic avian influenza. More information o n these exercises as well as on the toolbox and the tr aining courses on the organiza tion of such simulations can be obtained from the corresponding author.

One of the biggest obstacles to effective engagement of vet- erinarians in emer- gency preparedness and response is the veterinary commu- nity's lack of aware- ness of their role in public health and emergency prepared- ness. Page 14 One Health Newsletter Volume 4 Issue 4 Engaging Veterinarians in P ublic Health: One County's Efforts Jenifer Chatfield, DVM and Barbara Will We are all aware of the import ance of integrating the entire p ublic health com- munity in planning and response efforts as we strive to be bett er prepared for any dis- aster to ensure minimal damage and a quick recovery to the glob al community. At times, cultivating community p artners from di fferent profes sional fields can prove challenging, h owever, with the cons tant threat of severe weather in our state, hurricane preparedness is a good starting point. Veterinarians are trusted and credi- ble community partners and can c ontribute significantly to an e mergency response whether the disaster involves disease or large property destruc tion. Veterinarians may be able to provide epidemiology expertise with their knowledge of \"herd health\" princi- ples. Additionally, veterinarians can provide leadership for t he local Medical Reserve Corps (MRC), a volunteer organiza tion that supports Emergency S upport Function #8 - Public Health and Medical Services (ESF-8) and is administere d by the County Health Department (CHD). Veteri nary professionals can also per form animal and hu- man decontamination at hospitals and shelters. One of the bigg est obstacles to effec- tive engagement of veterinarians in emergency preparedness and response is the vet- erinary community's lack of awareness of their role in public h ealth and emergency preparedness. In fact, a common question from public health pa rtners is \"How do we engage our vets?\" This article describes how one CHD is engagi ng their veterinary community as public health response partners. In February 2010, the Manatee Co unty Health Department (MCHD) invited the State's Veterinary and Agricultur e Liaison to a meeting with th eir internal prepared- ness team consisting of the MCHD Administrator, an Environmenta l Supervisor, the Preparedness Planner, and a Preparedness Project Coordinator. The goal was to develop a more collaborative and collegial relationship with th e veterinary community, and to better integrate veterina rians in community all-hazard d isaster response. The existing relationship with local veterinarians consisted of reg ulatory correspondence related to rabies ale rts and biohazardou s waste management. Over the next six months, a founding leader of the Manatee Cou nty Veterinary Medical Society became a valua ble contributing member of the gr oup, as did repre- sentatives from Manatee County's Division of Emergency Manageme nt (DEM) and Animal Services (ESF-17). Follo wing much discussion, the group decided that an ac- curate assessment of the veterina ry community's public health p reparedness and emergency response awareness was needed. In order to encourage local veterinari- ans to participate in this \"resour ce assessment,\" the Departmen t of Health (DOH) of- fered a continuing education (CE) program in conjunction with t he routine monthly Manatee County Veterinary Medica l Society meetin g. To encourag e veterinary partici- pation, the veterinary society obt ained private sponsorship for the dinner associated with the meeting. The CE lecture provided at the meeting empha sized the veterinar- ian's role in community recovery and the typical zoonotic disea ses of public health in- terest following disas ters. The lecture generated active audie nce participation with lively discussion. Additionally, t he DEM provided detailed, ful l-color GIS maps display- ing the location of all licensed veterinary facilities in relat ion to the county's flood zones, using updated data provided by the CHD. A survey was admin- istered to assess the veterinarians' aware- ness, knowledge of, and interest in disas- ter preparedness. The 20 question sur- vey included ques- tions about county of practice, gender, cur- rent preparedness practices as busi- ness owners, famili- arity with response structure, knowledge of both animal and human reportable diseases and related actions, and knowl- edge of zoonotic dis- ease incidence within their practice. Page 15 One Health Newsletter Volume 4 Issue 4 During the meeting, a survey was administered to assess the ve terinarians' awareness, knowledge of, and intere st in disaster preparedness. In order to receive a certificate for the CE credit, t he survey had to be completed a nd returned that evening. The 20-question survey included questions about county of pract ice, gender, current preparedness practices as business owners, fa miliarity with res ponse structure such as Incident Command System (ICS), knowledge of both animal and human reportable diseases and related actions, k nowledge of zoonotic disease inc idence within their practice, primary information s ources, and interest in joining organized teams such as the State Agriculture Response Team (SART) or the MRC. The surv ey was largely based on a prior survey developed for online distribution by a previous Polk County EIS fellow, but was tailore d to Manatee County needs. Twenty surveys [26% of all licen sed DVMs (Doctors of Veterinar y Medicine) in the county] were distributed a t the meeting. The average time in practice for respon- dents was 17 years and the gender d istribution was nearly equal with 55% male and 45% female respondents. The survey results indicated interest in preparedness and emergency response as a partner to public health, but also reve aled several gaps in knowledge related to disaster preparedness and response. One i nteresting finding was that 20% of respondents woul d contact their personal physic ian rather than their local health department if they suspected or knew of a human ca se of a reportable zoonotic disease. Eighty-five p ercent of respondents were inte rested in zoonotic dis- ease training and only 15% of res pondents had a continuity of o perations plan (COOP) in place at their practice. The results of the survey confir med that the vete rinary commun ity had limited knowledge pertaining to zoonotic disease response procedures an d public health dis- aster preparedness. Due to the sm all sample, these results may not accurately repre- sent all veterinarians in Manatee County; therefore, results sh ould be interpreted with caution. The survey results are still a useful aid for CHDs in their engagement of vet- erinarians in disaster preparedness and public health efforts. The survey information was shar ed with the Manatee County Vete rinary Medi- cal Society's leaders, and addi tional information regarding pub lic health issues and preparedness was distributed to t he Society's members. The loc al veterinarians have continued discussions with MCH D and Manatee County Emergency Ma nagement Leaders regarding their role i n public health and preparedness.

Veter inarians can join the MRC and participate as leaders and in other roles as defined by the CHD Administrator. The survey data is s ummarized in the t able below. In addition to these find- ings, several responders provided unsolicited, sometimes contra dictory, comments to their answers at the end of the survey, suggesting that a comme nt field should be in- cluded for individual questions in future questionnaires.

Page 17 One Health Newsletter Volume 4 Issue 4 A face-to-face meeting where ve terinary practitioners and publ ic health offi- cials are able to get to know e ach other, identify areas of com mon interests, and em- brace each other as community partners can be valuable towards cultivating a produc- tive and amicable relationship between them. S urvey respondent s (66%) indicated a preference for face-to-face trai ning workshops at professional conferences. Other long-term objectives of the MCHD are to gather emergency contac t information from all the county's practicing vete rinarians and to obtain permiss ion to use their facilities to aid and possibly shelter los t or stray animals if needed aft er a disaster. Future meetings will focus on more routine public health issues to pro mote safe pet owner- ship through continuing education topics such as rabies and oth er zoonoses. The data collected in this sim ple outreach effort will help di rect further efforts in engaging the local veterinarians in public health and provid ing a better integrated disaster response in Manatee Co unty. Similar activities may pr ovide ample opportu- nity for public health officials and county health departments statewide to cultivate stronger community par tnerships with their local veterinarians.

Page 18 One Health Newsletter Volume 4 Issue 4 The American Nurses Association and the One Health Initiative Holly Carpenter, BSN, RN Consider the following tragic situations: Living and dead anima ls, feed, ma- nure, urine, and production operations congregated on a small l and area (US Environ- mental Protection Agency's defin ition of Animal Feeding Operati ons). Fish in the wild, such as King Mackerel and Swordfish, contain unsafe levels of m ercury. Herds are given antibiotics to keep them heal thy as a precautionary measu re, not to cure an ill- ness. Cows are given hormones to increase their milk productio n. All of these are harmful not only to the animals, but to human and environmental health as well. The American Nurses Association (ANA) acknowledges this powerfu l connec- tion and strives to increase nurse awareness and action in envi ronmental health. In December 2010, the ANA joined the One Health Initiative to demo nstrate nurses' ac- knowledgement that animals and hum ans all share o ne environment and that the indi- vidual health of animals and the actions of humans affect all l ife on earth. Negative health impacts on any individual group\u2014animals, humans, or the environment\u2014affect the health of all three. Human health is tied closely to animal health in many ways. Hu mans eat ani- mals and animal products. Humans can be infected by contact wit h animals or by con- tact with animal by-products. A nimal waste and veterinary pharm aceuticals impact our water supply. Both humans' and animals' health suffer when they encounter environ- mental impacts, such as po lluted food, air, and water Mercury: Mercury is a powerful neurotoxin and is quite hazardous to hu mans, especially the young. Humans oft en receive mercury exposure fro m fish consumption. Mercury is very dense; it seeks the lowest point in bodies of w ater. It is naturally occur- ring in nature, but also is intr oduced to water by the settling of air emissions, pollution, and industrial and house hold dumping. Mercury in water eventua lly becomes methyl- mercury. Small fish nibble on t he mercury at the body of the wa ter's bed, and are then eaten by larger fish. More and more mercury is accumulated in the fatty tissue of each successive fish, until finally humans eat the larger fish. The ANA has championed re- moving mercury from health care , and also works to preserve and enhance the federal Clean Air Act by decreasing mer cury emissions from coal-fired p ower plants. Pharmaceutical waste: Humans and animals flush, excrete, and rinse waste pharmaceuticals into the Earth's water supply at a staggering r ate. ANA recently re- leased their position statement on this issue, which states tha t it supports pharmaceu- tical waste disposal practices t hat prevent drug dispersion and misuse, as well as pre- vent the release of drugs into the environment. Research on \"gr eener\" pharmaceuti- cals and improved wastewater filt ration systems are key, as wel l as expanded educa- tion, advocacy, and legislation. Prescribing practices that dec rease pharmaceutical waste, yet protect health, mu st also be carefully examined. Non-therapeutic use of antibiotics: Nurses are concerned with the unneces- sary additives given to livesto ck, such as non-therapeutic anti biotics. Meat and poultry producers often use antibiotics in animal feed to promote growt h or as prophylaxis. This overuse of non-therapeutic antibiotics may very well lead to the loss of many anti- biotics' efficacy. Thus, the ANA (via an ANA House of Delegates Resolution) advo- cates for meat/poultry producer s and bulk purch asers of meat to phase out the non- The report empha- sizes the need for groups involved in veterinary medical education, accredita- tion, and test- ing/licensure to work together to equip North American veterinary medical school graduates with the core knowl- edge, skills, and competencies re- quired to meet soci- ety's evolving needs. Page 19 One Health Newsletter Volume 4 Issue 4 therapeutic use of medically important antibiotics, and advocat es against the use of fluoroquinolones in poultry. A dditionally, the ANA fully suppo rts legislation, such as the Preservation of Antibiotics for Medical Treat ment Act (H.R. 965) to decrease the inappropriate use of antibiotics in agriculture. The ANA recognizes t he value of the One Health Initiative and a ppreciates the collaboration of its supporters . Animals and humans all share the same environment, and it is time for all health car e professionals to work togeth er to improve the health of all life on Earth.

July 20, 2011 - On Sunday, July 17, the boar d of directors of the Association of American Ve terinary Medical Colleges (AAV MC) approved a re- port by the North American Veterin ary Medical Education Consort ium (NAVMEC) on the future of veterinary medica l education. The report, \"Roadma p for Veterinary Medi- cal Education in the 21st Century : Responsive, Collaborative, F lexible,\" emphasizes the need for groups involved in veterinary medical education, a ccreditation, and test- ing/licensure to work together to equip North American veterina ry medical school graduates with the core knowledge, skills, and competencies req uired to meet society' s evolving needs. The report's five main goals are to: 1) graduate career-ready v eterinarians who are proficient and have the confidence to use an agreed-upo n set of core compe- tencies; 2) ensure that admissi ons, curricula, accreditation, a nd testing/licensure are competency-driven; 3) share reso urces to ensure veterinary medi cal education is of the highest quality and maximall y cost effective; 4) promote an economically viable education system for both colleges of veterinary medicine and v eterinary students; and 5) stimulate a profession-wi de focus on innovation, flexibi lity, and action. Recommendations in the report des cribe core competencies in thr ee main areas: 1) multi-species knowledge plus clinical competence in o ne or more species or disciplines; 2) \"One Health\" competency related to the intersec tion of animal, human, and environmental health; and 3) the development of professiona l competencies. Pro- fessional competencies include: communication; collaboration; m anagement; lifelong learning research; leadership; diver sity and multi-cultural awareness; and the ability to adapt to changing environments. The report, submitted by a nine-pe rson NAVMEC board of director s, is the culmination of several years o f work by NAVMEC, a consortium co nvened by the AAVMC that consists of a wide sp ectrum of stakeholders of veter inary medical educa- tion, accreditation, testing, and licensure.

On the Web: http://www.aavmc.org Meeting Summary: Consideration of an International So- ciety for One Health (ISOH) Prepared by Martyn Jeggo and John Mackenzie Many meetings and discussions have taken place over the last de cade on the concept and implementation of One Health and related activities . One example is the One Health Initiative (www.onehealthinitiative.com) managed by Bruce Kaplan, Laura Kahn, and Tom Monath. This has received more than 500 endorseme nts by science leaders and defines One Health as \"the collaborative efforts of multiple disciplines working locally, nationally and globally to attain optimal heal th for people, animals, plants, and our environment.\" A number of international ministerial meetings have taken place with a focus on avian and pandemic influenza (IMCAPI) for example, at Sharm- el-Sheikh and Ha- noi. WHO, FAO, OIE, UNICEF, the World Bank, and UNISIC have als o cooperated to develop a joint strategic framew ork to address risks associated with emerging and re- emerging diseases. In parallel, there has been a key agreement between FAO, OIE, and WHO to work together on One Health, again with an initial f ocus on avian influ- enza/human pandemic influenza, but with an intention to move to wards joint programs in other areas. The Public Health Agency of Canada hosted an invitation-only \"O ne World, One Health\" meeting in Winnipeg, Canada in 2009 to develop a series of actions that could be implemented at the national level. This was followed in 2010 by a similar meeting hosted by the CDC in Stone Mountain, USA. With a 3-5 year horiz on, it identified seven key activity areas: The 1st International Congress on One Health provided a fo- rum for scientific presentations on the impact of disease on humans, animals, and the environment, and also provided ample opportunity for discussion and de- bate on how this sci- ence can be used for policy development. At the Congress, the idea of establishing an International Soci- ety for One Health (ISOH) was dis- cussed. Page 21 One Health Newsletter Volume 4 Issue 4 Training One Health global network Information clearing house Needs assessment Capacity building Proof of concept Business plan development Working groups have been established under each activity area a nd are currently developing action plans for a range of undertakings. In February 2011, the 1st International Congress on One Health was held in Mel- bourne, Australia. This meeting not only provided a forum for s cientific presentations on the impact of disease on humans, animals, and the environmen t, but it also pro- vided ample opportunity for discussion and debate on how this s cience can be used for policy development. Around 650 people attended the Congress and developed fur- ther a range of concepts around One Health. These include that it: Recognizes the interdependence and need to improve dialogue wit h respect to disease risks at the human, animal, and ecosystems interface s Recognizes that communication, c ollaboration, and trust between human and animal health practitioners is key Has a broad vision that include s food safety/security, economic s, and social behavior Needs to promote the 'doable' suc h as improving emerging infect ious dis- ease surveillance and response, and developing the broader appr oach Emphasizes community participation and an open dialogue Requires both 'ground-up 'and 'top-down' action At the Congress, the idea of establishing an International Soci ety for One Health (ISOH) was discussed. This received some support, but encounter ed a number of res- ervations. The focus was on research collaboration and coordina tion, on holding an international congress every two years, and on one or a limited number of targeted One Health journals. It was agreed to hold a meeting in London in June to discuss these ideas further. Subsequent to the Cong ress, considerable co ncern was expressed, particularly by the UN Agencies, CDC, and the Eu ropean Union, about the formati on of an ISOH. Therefore, the agenda for this m eeting was modified to provide a more general debate on One Health needs that might i nclude the formation of ISOH as an option, or possi- bly a loose One Health associat ion as another option. Similarly , while the initial plan was to invite a restricted numbe r of people to the meeting to a ssist the development of ISOH, a general invitation was subsequently offered for anyone wishing to attend the meeting.

By their very nature, the fields of human medicine, veterinary medicine, and the environmental sci- ences are comple- mentary and syner- gistic in confronting, controlling, and pre- venting zoonotic dis- eases from infecting across species. The Florida Medical Association supports the \"One Health\" ini- tiative designed to promote collabora- tion among the health professions.
