[Statement of Candidacy ](#JessicaDiLeo) Since 2010 I have been heavily involved in my state pharmacy organization, and while I continue to advocate for pharmacy in my home state, I am eager to become involved on a national level. I have extensive experience in training, management, and leadership in both community and medication management settings with over 20 years' experience in the pharmacy profession. In addition, I have served eight years on the Arizona Pharmacy Association Board of Directors in a variety of positions, most recently as President. These combined experiences and my exemplary ability to analyze current situations, strategize, and implement ideas plus my passion for the profession make me an ideal candidate for your next Coordinator-elect for the APhA-APPM Medication Management SIG. If elected, I will work closely with the Coordinator and other SIG leaders to deliver results. I believe the top three priorities of the SIG should be as simple as ABC: action, best practices, and collaboration. First, create a call to action to recruit new and entice inactive members to re-join our network. As our network expands, we should encourage members to share their experiences, analyze overlapping trends, and identify outliers to aid in improving our resources for quality MTM programs. Lastly, collaboration should be on the forefront of our minds. Not just with each other, but other SIGs as MTM is no longer a niche practice and can be applied to all aspects of pharmacy care. Together, I believe we can continue to learn from each other and take the passion we have for our profession to the next level. If given the opportunity, I will dedicate my time, my passion, and my experience to you and the mission of our community. Thank you for your time and consideration to be your next APhA-APPM "}
