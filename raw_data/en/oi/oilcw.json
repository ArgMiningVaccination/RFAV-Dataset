The 7.5-minute Lake Owen quadrangle is located in southeastern Wy [ Water-Chemistry and Isotope Data for Selected Springs, Geysers, Streams, and Rivers in Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming ](/data/water-chemistry-and-isotope-data-selected-springs-geysers-streams-and-rivers-yellowstone) There are over 10,000 hydrothermal features in Yellowstone National Park (YNP), where waters have pH values ranging from about 1 to 10 and surface temperatures up to 95 \u00b0C. Active geothermal areas in YNP provide insight into a variety of processes occurring at depth, such as water-rock and oxidation-reduction (redox) reactions, the formation of alteration minerals, and microbial (thermophile) meta [ Stochastic Empirical Loading and Dilution Model (SELDM) model archive and instructions for the Siskiyou Pass, Oregon ](/data/stochastic-empirical-loading-and-dilution-model-seldm-model-archive-and-instructions-siskiyou) Chloride deicers have been applied by the Oregon Department of Transportation (ODOT) to Interstate-5 (I-5) from the Oregon-California border north to mile marker 10 for several years in the high-elevation area known as the Siskiyou Pass. Magnesium chloride (MgCl2) and sodium chloride (NaCl) are applied to keep the interstate safe for drivers and allow for efficient transport of goods and people th [ Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) cyanotoxin data for eight mesocosm experiments in the Caloosahatchee River, Florida from May 2019 through August 2021 ](/data/quantitative-polymerase-chain-reaction-qpcr-cyanotoxin-data-eight-mesocosm-experiments) An interdisciplinary and multiagency study was conducted in southern Florida to examine harmful algal bloom (HAB) dynamics on the Caloosahatchee River, which drains from Lake Okeechobee to the west into the Gulf of Mexico. Using in-situ mesocosm experiments, ammonium, nitrate, phosphate, and urea were altered from ambient conditions to determine the effects on cyanotoxin biosynthesis gene presence [ Indium deposits in the United States ](/data/indium-deposits-united-states) This U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) data release provides the descriptions of the only U.S. sites-including mining districts, mineral occurrences, and mine features-that have reported production and (or) resources of indium (In). This dataset contains the Bingham and West Desert deposits in Utah, and the Chino site in New Mexico. Indium is considered a critical and strategic mineral because of its [ Network Analysis of USGS Streamflow Gages (ver. 2.0, May 2023) ](/data/network-analysis-usgs-streamflow-gages-ver-20-may-2023) This data release has a workflow, data, and results of an analysis of the coverage, resolution, and representation of variables related to public interests in streamflow information by the USGS streamflow gaging network that was active in water year 2020. The workflow for the analysis is implemented as scripts and functions in the statistical programming language R. The spatial framework for the a [ USGS National and Global Oil and Gas Assessment Project-U.S. Gulf Coast, Deep Tuscaloosa Conventional Gas: Assessment Unit Boundary, Assessment Input Data, and Fact Sheet Data Tables ](/data/usgs-national-and-global-oil-and-gas-assessment-project-us-gulf-coast-deep-tuscaloosa) This data release contains the boundaries of assessment units and input data for the assessment of undiscovered Deep Tuscaloosa Group sandstones conventional gas resources in the U.S. Gulf Coast in Louisiana and Mississippi. The Assessment Unit is the fundamental unit used in the National Assessment Project for the assessment of undiscovered oil and gas resources. The Assessment Unit is defined wi [ Digital database of geologic units, contacts, and faults for Mineral Resource Potential Map of the Turtle Mountains Wilderness Study Area, San Bernardino County, California (U.S. Geological Survey Bulletin 1713-B, 1988, Plate 1) ](/data/digital-database-geologic-units-contacts-and-faults-mineral-resource-potential-map-turtle) This map geodatabase digitally represents the general distribution of bedrock geologic map units in the Turtle Mountains area, California, as portrayed in Plate 1 of USGS Bulletin 1713-B, Mineral resources of the Turtle Mountains Wilderness Study Area, San Bernardino County, California (1988), https://doi.org/10.3133/b1713B. The map covers parts of the Rice, Turtle Mountains, and Savahia Peak 15' [ Historical produced water chemistry data compiled for the Santa Maria Valley Oil Field, Santa Barbara County, California ](/data/historical-produced-water-chemistry-data-compiled-santa-maria-valley-oil-field-santa-barbara) This digital dataset contains historical geochemical and other information for 89 samples of produced water from 84 sites in the Santa Maria Valley Oil Field in Santa Barbara County, California. Produced water is a term used in the oil industry to describe water that is produced from oil wells as a byproduct along with the oil and gas. Additionally, 3 samples from 3 sites that represent source wat [ Model Archive for Analysis of Flows, Concentrations, and Loads of Highway and Urban Runoff and Receiving-Stream Stormwater in Southern New England with the Stochastic Empirical Loading and Dilution Model (SELDM) ](/data/model-archive-analysis-flows-concentrations-and-loads-highway-and-urban-runoff-and-receiving) This data release documents the data and models used to assess flows, concentrations, and loads of highway and urban runoff and of stormwater within receiving streams in southern New England. There are more than 48,000 locations in southern New England where roads cross streams and many more locations where runoff from developed areas may discharge to receiving streams; information about runoff di [ Whooping crane migration habitat selection disturbance data and maps ](/data/whooping-crane-migration-habitat-selection-disturbance-data-and-maps) These data and maps were developed to support an effort to understand how whooping cranes (Grus americana) select stopover habitat in the presence of human infrastructure. Location and associated data came from whooping cranes from the Aransas-Wood Buffalo Population, 2010-2016. We marked a sample of 57 whooping cranes with leg-mounted transmitters that acquired locations via the global positionin [ Water quality and survival data for 96 hour bioassays conducted near the Blacktail Creek wastewater spill, North Dakota, 2015-17 ](/data/water-quality-and-survival-data-96-hour-bioassays-conducted-near-blacktail-creek-wastewater) Data set contains water quality measurements and survival of fathead minnow from in situ and laboratory bioassay exposures to wastewater from a spill on Blacktail Creek, North Dakota, USA "}
