A comprehensive review of the more serious adverse events associated with the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna mRNA vaccines is warranted, given the massive number of vaccine doses administered worldwide and the novel mechanism of action of these mRNA vaccines in the healthcare industry. Methods: A systematic review of the literature was conducted to identify relevant studies that have reported mRNA COVID-19 vaccine-related adverse events. Results: Serious and severe adverse events following mRNA COVID-19 vaccinations are rare. While a definitive causal relationship was not established in most cases, important adverse events associated with post-vaccination included rare and non-fatal myocarditis and pericarditis in younger vaccine recipients, thrombocytopenia, neurological effects such as seizures and orofacial events, skin reactions, and allergic hypersensitivities. Conclusions: As a relatively new set of vaccines already administered to billions of people, COVID-19 mRNA-based vaccines are generally safe and efficacious. Further studies on long-term adverse events and other unpredictable reactions in close proximity to mRNA vaccination are required.
