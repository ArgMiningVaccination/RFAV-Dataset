Affiliates may also submit an exception request in the VMS. Your vaccination record photo must clearly show your name and that you have been fully vaccinated. For those who have received a two-dose vaccine (e.g., Pfizer and Moderna), your documentation must indicate that you have received your second dose. Submitting Proof of Vaccination [Use the VMS to submit documentation](https://vms.jh.edu/) of both COVID-19 and flu vaccinations. - Start by selecting which vaccine is being documented and confirming your identity - Enter the vaccine manufacturer and each date that you received a vaccine dose - Upload a photo of your CDC COVID-19 vaccination record card if you were vaccinated in the U.S.; if you do not have a CDC card, you may upload other forms of documentation if they are in English (by a certified translation, if necessary) and from an official source such as your health care provider. Translation services are available via [Orbit Translation](https://www.orbittranslation.com/). If you were vaccinated in Maryland; Washington, D.C., or West Virginia, you can register and obtain your COVID-19 vaccination record from [Maryland MyIR](https://myirmobile.com/), a free website service that allows consumers to view and print copies of their official vaccination records directly from ImmuNet, Maryland's immunization information system. Just register, download or print a copy of your certification of vaccination, and upload it into VMS. Your doctor's office or the location where you were vaccinated (e.g., CVS, Walgreens, etc.) should also have a record and you should reach out to them to get a copy. Often you can find this under your immunization or prescription website on the patient portal or pharmacy website. After submitting your documentation, you will receive an email at your JHU email address, and you will receive a second email when the documentation has been reviewed and approved. If your documentation is not approved (e.g., your card is not in English, is not legible, etc.), you will receive an email explaining the issue with instructions for how to upload the corrected information. Questions regarding this process and the status of your vaccine documentation should be directed to [VMS@jhu.edu](mailto:VMS@jhu.edu). Request an Exception Start by selecting the vaccine (flu, COVID-19, or COVID-19 booster) and the type of exception you are requesting\u2014religious and medical. There are only two exception types available: - Religious Exceptions: Follow the on-screen instructions to provide your contact information, the reason for your request, information about any previous religious exceptions that you may have been granted, and documentation to support your belief(s) and the need for an accommodation (if possible). Note that JHU representatives may need to discuss the nature of your religious accommodation with your religion's spiritual leader (if applicable) or religious scholars to address your request. - Medical Exceptions: The easiest way to request a medical exception is to [complete a Medical Exception Form](https://covidinfo.jhu.edu/assets/uploads/sites/10/2021/06/JH_Medical_Exception_Form.pdf), which you can download here or through VMS. Your health care provider will need to complete and sign the form AND provide a signed and dated letter with the information requested in the form (documentation or medical records supporting your request). Once you have the completed form, access VMS, enter your preferred contact information and contact information for your physician, then upload a scan or photo of the form. Other forms of documentation may be accepted, but they must include all of the information that is on the Medical Exception Form. There are only two reasons that a medical exception will be granted: - History of a previous allergic reaction and documentation to indicate an immediate hypersensitivity reaction to the COVID-19 vaccine or a component of the vaccine. - Treatment of COVID-19 symptoms with monoclonal antibodies or convalescent plasma within the last 90 days. If this option applies, you will be required to upload vaccination documentation after the 90-day waiting period has elapsed. Before you submit a request for any type of exception, you must - Verify that the information you submit is complete and accurate to the best of your knowledge - Acknowledge your understanding that any intentional misrepresentation may result in disciplinary action, including employment termination You will receive an email at your JHU email address when your request for an exception has been submitted and another email if it has been approved. Not all requests for exceptions will be granted. If your request is not approved and/or if additional information is needed, a JHU representative will contact you with instructions for how to proceed.
