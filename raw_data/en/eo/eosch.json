A mutually agreed standard operating procedure shall establish the procedures for the implementation of the preceding paragraph. Article nineteen 1. The United States forces may remove demountable structures, equipment, and other removable property from the IDAs at any time, leaving the grounds in serviceable condition.

The functioning and maintenance of general services and installations of the base, and the management of provisioning for these services and installations shall be the responsibility of the Commander of the base, who shall assure to the United States forces the availability-of these services and installations under conditions which guarantee the operations of United States units. To discharge this responsibility and promptly and effectively resolve any contingency, the Commander of the base will seek the collaboration of the United States forces.

The above provisions shall be implemented for each base by an MOU mutually agreed upon in the Permanent Committee. 2. The Commander of the base shall establish the necessary provisions so that the Commander of the United States forces has timely information regarding any foreseeable change in the system of provision of the services or in the normal carrying out of activities of the base.

Individuals who require access to a base for the performance of a contract shall be granted such access within seven (7) days of a request by United States authorities. Such access may be denied or withdrawn for reasons of security or due to the individual's misconduct on the base. The measures adopted by the commander of the base may be the subject of consultations in the Permanent Committee. The denial of access for such reasons shall not be the basis under Spanish law for liability on the part of the governments of Spain or the United States. The United States shall not make a claim against the government of Spain for such denial of access. 8.
