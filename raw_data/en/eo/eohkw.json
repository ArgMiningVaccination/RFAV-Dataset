National Pancreatic Cancer Advocacy Day is the largest single national gathering of people committed to fighting pancreatic cancer from all 50 states. Hundreds of advocates will come together to gain support, hear about the latest in pancreatic cancer research and learn how to educate Congress about the urgent need for increased funding for this disease. Pancreatic Cancer Action Network's Patient Registry https://www.pancan.org/patientregistry/ The Patient Registry is an active database of information about persons with pancreatic cancer, developed by the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network for the purpose of advancing research through patient information, while aiding in the improvement of care for pancreatic cancer patients and their families. The Patient Registry is confidential and will support our vision of doubling pancreatic cancer survival by 2020. Clinical Trial Finder https://clinicaltrials.pancan.org/ The Pancreatic Cancer Action Network has launched its Clinical Trial Finder to healthcare professionals. The Clinical Trial Finder allows healthcare professionals to quickly, and accurately, find clinical trials for their pancreatic cancer patients. Throug h an easy -to-use interface, our current and comprehensive database of U.S. clinical trials that we have been using to conduct personalized clinical trial searches is now fully accessible to healthcare professionals, 24/7, by registering for a free account. Note that 2 pharmaceutical and other industry professionals are also invited to set up an account to access our database and assess the landscape to better inform their planning of future trials. Know Your TumorSM: Powerful Knowledge, Personal Treatment https://www.pancan.org/knowyourtumor/ Information tumor/ initiative is designed to provide pancreatic cancer patients and their treating oncologists with access to molecular information about patients' tumors, to sup port an outcomes registry to capture patient experiences, to provide expert physician review to improve outcomes for current and subsequent patients, and to reduce barriers to clinical trial enrollment.

Hence, the authors' dat a provide insight into how oncogenic KRas interacts with growth factor signaling to induce the formation of pancreatic cancer. Mesenchymal Stem Cells Promote Pancreatic Tumor Growth by Inducing Alternative Polarization of Macrophages http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26992915 Journal : Neoplasia Institution(s) : University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI Corresponding author(s) : Marina Pasca di Magliano Pancreatic Cancer Action author : Marina Pasca di Magliano , PhD: recipient, 2009 Paul Mitchell - Career Development Award Major finding : Targeting the stroma is emerging as a new paradigm in pancreatic cancer; however, efforts to that effect are hampered by our limited understanding of t he nature and function of stromal components. Here, the authors uncover previously unappreciated heterogeneity within the stroma and identify interactions among stromal components that promote tumor growth and could be targeted therapeutically . Ablation of Sensory Neurons in a Genetic Model of Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma Slows Initiati on and P rogression of Cancer https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26929329 Journal : Proceedings of the Nati onal Academy of Sciences Institution(s) : University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA , and others Corresponding author(s) : Brian Davis or Andrew Rhim Pancreatic Cancer Action Network -affiliated authors : o Howard Crawford, PhD: member, Scientific and Medical Advisory Board o Andrew Rhim, MD: recipient, 2013 Career Development Award Major finding : Here, the authors show that sensory neurons, an under -studied cohort of the pancreas tumor stroma, play a significant role in the initiation and progression of the early stages of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) .

Industry news: Halozyme Doses First Patient in Phase 3 Clinical Trial of PEGPH20 in Combination Diego, CA Major finding : Halozyme Therapeutics, Inc., a biotechnology company developing novel oncology and drug-delivery therapies, announced the first patient has been dosed in its Halo -301 | Pancreatic study, a Phase 3 clinical trial in previously untreated metastatic pancreatic cancer patients. The global, randomized, double -blind, placebo controlled trial will study Halozyme's investigational drug, PEGPH20, in combination with ABRAXANE\u00ae (nab -paclitaxel) and gemcitabine in patients identified to have tumors that accumulate high levels of hyaluronan (HA).
