Singing is not just about talent but also about putting in the necessary effort and dedication to hone your craft and make a name for yourself in the competitive world of music. Singers need to practice regularly to maintain their vocal range, control, skill, and technique. It requires regular Riyaz, to have a melodious voice. Many singers have to leave their hometowns and move to different cities for work- it can be a daunting task, as it involves leaving behind familiar surroundings and support systems which is the most challenging yet the most necessary decision to be taken. It is of utmost importance that Singers look after their diet, exercise, vocal hygiene, and even mental health to keep their overall health maintained. Homeopathy is the only science which is human-specific and looks after the complete needs of an individual. In other words, Homeopathy ensures the complete physical, mental, and spiritual well-being of an individual.
