His practice, and that of his colleagues, is busy. He is slightly more successful than colleagues at keeping his sickest patients out of the hospital, but his patient satisfaction data is somewhat worse. In the last year, he's received a few complaint letters calling him \"disrespectful,\" but in his defense, he says none of his colleagues set limits with medication seeking or overly somatic patients. He's a self-described \"grinder\" meaning that he sees more patients than his peers in a typical session, though data reveals that he cancels more clinics than his peers, so his overall RVU's are around the median for his group. He describes his work this way, \"I'm an air-traffic controller, almost all my planes land just fine with a little help, but occasionally, there's a disaster. I spend too much time with my face in the electronic medical record because our EMR sucks. I have a handful of patients who are incredibly draining \u2014 some of my sickle cell kids and hemophiliacs whine, are medication seeking, and depressed.\" Dr. X drinks half a bottle of wine to one bottle per night (a wine lover, he and his wife typically share a bottle or two) and reports feelings of frustration more days than not, as well as some emotional numbing. He's been taking Ambien to sleep for a few years but doesn't generally feel well rested. Financially, he reports making good money but \"it still doesn't feel like enough.\" He's had a few recent conflicts with his his partners over plans to refurbish the office and how they should manage a young physician who wants to join the practice. On a personal note, he's got some mild hypertension, and he was recently sued, which angers him. Otherwise, he says when asked, \"I'm good brother. Everyone should have my problems.\" Dan Shapiro, Ph.D. 3 Put variables in order, in terms of their power to predict MI's: Diabetes Smoking Hypertension Plasma Lipoproteins Obesity Diet Physical Activity Alcohol Consumption Psychosocial variables Quick and Dirty Assessment: Of the following, which is most accurate? 1) I enjoy my work. I have no symptoms of burnout 2) Occasionally I am under stress, and I don't always have as much energy as I once did, but I don't feel burned out 3) I am definitely burning out and have one or more symptoms of burnout, such as physical and emotional exhaustion 4) The symptoms of burnout that I'm experiencing won't go away. I think about frustration at work a lot 5) I feel completely burned out and often wonder if I can go on. I am at the point where I may need some changes or may need to seek some sort of help Dan Shapiro, Ph.D. 4 Rage? Letters of complaint? Physical? Emotional numbing? Time thief? Data on physician burnout Rates are high Rates are worsening Burnout has serious consequences Specialty breakdown 37% -- Derm to 53% critical care Oncology = 44% ETOH meet WHO diagnostic criteria for abuse or dependence 12.9% of males, 21.4% females Higher ETOH correlated with depression, burnout, suicidal ideation, worsened QOL, lower career satisfaction. Also related to medical error: recent medical error = increased ETOH! Dan Shapiro, Ph.D. 5 Burnout increasing: It's getting worse 9% increase in physicians reporting burnout symptoms between 2011 and 2014. Consequences: Depression Suicidal ideation Reduced safety Increased rates of malpractice Canary in the coalmine: Complaint letters! Systems observations More hours = more burnout Uninterested or disengaged boss = more burnout Computerized order entry = more burnout Perceived control over practice environment, call & coverage, overall workload = reduced burnout Isolation from other docs/nurses = more burnout Observations from treating physicians: Themes 1. Forget the why 2. Neglect key relationships 3. Hiders 4. Use self-deprecation as a motivating strategy Dan Shapiro, Ph.D. 6 5. Competing vs connecting 6. Fraud syndrome 7. Stuffing emotions as lifelong pattern 8. Somatic patients 9. Pressure: Overbuy, too many pts, not enough time off 10. Mistakes haunt 11. Celebrate self-denial instead of self-care 12. Over-controlling 13. Exposure to tragedy 14. Self-destructive coping 7 areas of life to make decisions in: 1. Financial 2. Family Magic trio: Compliment, be helpful, deeply inquire 3. Physical 4. Intellectual 5. Relationships 6. Clinical 7.

NCCN v 1.2016 Guidelines: Treatment of Metastatic Disease Not Amenable to RAI Therapy For progressive and/or symptomatic di sease, consider lenvatinib or sorafeniby While not FDA approved for the treat ment of differentiated thyroid cancer, other commercially available small molecular kinase inhibitors can be considered for progressive and/or symptomatic disease if clinical trials or other systemic therapies are not available or appropriate. Consider resection if di stant metastases, and/or EBRT/SBRT/IMRT/other local therapies when available to metastatic lesions if progressive and/or symptomatic. Active surveillance may be appropriate in asymptomatic patients with indolent disease. yThe decision of whether to use lenvatinib or sorafenib should be individualized based on likelihood of response and comorbidities.

Thyroid .2009;9:1167-214.20/09/2016 19Summary: RAI refractory DTC 2016 Two drugs are now to treat RAI refractory DTC: sorafenib and lenvatinib -We have data that lenvatinib is active following sorafenib. -Await data on the efficacy of sorafenib following lenvatinib -Ability to manage toxicities will be key to success with these agents New data from SELECT shows an OS survival benefit in patients over 65 with rapidly progression disease. Summary: RAI refractory DTC 2016 As all patients will ultimately progress, both agents will be needed and will be used sequentially, as well as additional strategies A phase II of the addition of everolimus to sorafenib at the time of progression results in a PFS of 13.9 additional months. Other MKIs are also active in this setting including pazopanib and cabozantinib based on phase II evidence can be considered in third line20/09/2016 20MSB 05/30/09Thyroid Cancer: Clinical Pathology American Cancer Society. www.cancer.org/docroot/CRI/content/CRI T and Uldesman R.

Her stage is A. II B. III C. IVa D. IVb Answer is A: stage II. Patients under 45 are at most a stage II due to the overall good prognosis for patients in this age group.20/09/2016 27Review Questions QUESTION 2: The patient is treated with total thyroi dectomy and radioactive iodine. What additional treatment is indicated at this time? A. external beam radiation to the neck B. chemotherapy with doxorubicin C. observation only D. TSH suppression therapy Review Questions QUESTION 2: The patients is treated with total thyroi dectomy and radioactive iodine. What additional treatment is indicated at this time? A. external beam radiation to the neck B. chemotherapy with doxorubicin C. observation only D. TSH suppression therapy Answer is D: TSH suppression therapy. At this point in her treatment her disease is likely going to respond to RAI. However as she has residual disease in her lungs she should start out with her TSH suppressed. With time, if the disease responds completely and s he has not evidence of disease, this can be liberalize a bit. TSH suppression therapy has shown to have a survival benefit. C might also be considered, but close surveillance to US and Tg is indicated. A and B are not indicated.20/09/2016 28Review Questions QUESTION 3: A patient with metastatic RAI refractory differentiated thyroid cancer has tumor nodules that have doubled in size over the prior year. What are your treatment options at this point? A. observation B. start treatment with sorafenib C. start treatment with lenvatinib D. all of the above Review Questions QUESTION 3: A patient with metastatic RAI refractory differentiated thyroid cancer has tumor nodules that have doubled in size over the prior year. What are your treatment options at this point? A. observation B. start treatment with sorafenib C. start treatment with lenvatinib D. all of the above Answer is D: all of the above may be corre ct in different settings. If the tumor burden is very small (only a few lesions ), and the largest lesions are less than 1.5 cm, observation may be considered. Both sorafenib and lenvatinib have been approved for treatment in this setting, and the choice of which to use first should be individualized based on patient c haracteristics, and expected toxicity profiles.20/09/2016 29Review Questions QUESTION 4: A patient with newly diagnosed metastatic medullary thyroid cancer in the neck and lungs and a documented RET mutation comes to you for evaluation. He has had a complete thyroidectomy and had positive lymph nodes in the neck which were also removed. On CT scan the patient has approximately 15 lesions from 5mm to 2cm in the lungs. He is asymptomatic. What do you recommend? A. observation B. start treatment with vandetanib C. start treatment with cabozantinib D. external beam radiation to the neck References: 1.
