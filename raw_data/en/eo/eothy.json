The undergraduate nursing program is designed to prepare students who, upon graduation, will begin the practice of professional nursing. The program leads to the degree of Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) and provides a basis for graduate study in this discipline. The curriculum consists of courses in both general and professional education and is offered with different options oriented to the varying admissions qualifications of the applicants: - BSN Direct admit for First Year (small cohort) - BSN Traditional - BSN Second Career/Second Degree (including BSN for Veterans) - RN-BSN - RN-MSN options (currently in moratorium) Admission: BSN Programs All applications are reviewed to determine the capability of applicants to complete a Bachelor of Science in Nursing. Admission is highly competitive and is based primarily on academic performance. Prerequisite repeats are considered and can make an applicant ineligible to be considered for admission. Transcripts are also reviewed for full-time scholarly achievement and promise of success in this rigorous science and evidence-based curriculum. Prerequisite courses for the WSU College of Nursing Traditional BSN and BSN Second Career/Degree pathways must be completed within seven years of the application deadline to count toward admission. Nursing: BSN Direct Admit for First Year BSN First Year BSN Admission Students in this category are presumed to be entering professional nursing for the first time. They are admitted through the [Office of Undergraduate Admissions](/undergraduate/general-information/admission/) and complete general education/pre-professional courses offered through the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences. The students also complete a holistic admission process through the College of Nursing. The holistic admission process includes a critical evaluation of specific metrics. The holistic admission requirement necessitates community service and an essay submitted by the applicant detailing any personal attributes and experiences that the applicant feels would support their admission to the CON. The entire application packet is evaluated by an admission committee composed of individuals consisting of faculty from the undergraduate (UG) program, CON UG alumni and community partners. If admitted into the pathway, one prerequisite course can be taken at a community college. Nursing: BSN Second Career/Second Degree Program Admission Applicants in this category are eligible to apply for entry into Second Career/Second Degree Bachelor of Science in Nursing Program if they have completed a bachelor's degree in an area other than nursing and have completed the prerequisites (see below). Applicants must have completed all prerequisite courses with a grade of 'C' or better and candidates must have a minimum 3.0 grade point average in prerequisite courses to be eligible for consideration. A grade of 2.0 or higher in the science prerequisites is also required. The students also complete a holistic admission process through the College of Nursing. (Note: course prerequisites must be completed at time of application). The holistic admission process includes a critical evaluation of these same metrics as well as a requirement for community service and the submission of an essay detailing any personal attributes and experiences that the applicant feels would support their admission to the College of Nursing. The entire application packet is evaluated by an admission committee composed of individuals consisting of faculty from the undergraduate (UG) program, CON UG alumni and community partners. Admission to the program is competitive; completion of prerequisites with minimum requirements does not guarantee admission. Prerequisites (Second Career/Second Degree Program) The following are prerequisite requirements for admission consideration to the Second Career/Second Degree Program in the College of Nursing. If a second-degree student is interested in pursuing the Traditional (three-year) program rather than the Second-Degree Program, the student must complete the prerequisites for the Traditional BSN program. |Code||Title||Credits| & and Basic Life Mechanisms Laboratory [BIO 2270](/search/?P=BIO%202270) & [BIO 2271](/search/?P=BIO%202271) is geared toward Michigan-licensed registered nurses (RNs) who have completed an associate degree program or a diploma program and wish to continue their professional education. For requirements for this curriculum, see Nursing: [RN to BSN Completion Program](https://nursing.wayne.edu/rn-bsn/index.php). The RN to BSN pathway does not have course prerequisites; however, the following courses/requirements must be completed prior to graduation from WSU. These courses may have been completed within the associate degree. |Code||Title||Credits| [PSY 2410](/search/?P=PSY%202410) [PSY 2400](/search/?P=PSY%202400) Application to BSN Programs Application to the Bachelor of Science in Nursing programs is a dual application process.

Deferment Students who are admitted to the BSN program but have not enrolled in any College of Nursing courses may request a deferral of up to one year. Deferrals, when granted, apply only to the track into which the student was admitted. A deferral decision does not, for example, allow a student admitted to the Traditional track to then be admitted to the CD2 track. Deferrals are generally granted for unanticipated circumstances (i.e., illness or pregnancy). Deferrals are usually not granted for financial reasons, inability to complete prerequisite courses or other non-health related reasons. A written requests for deferral is required. Applicants must explain the reason for the deferral and send a detailed letter addressed to the Wayne State University College of Nursing's Scholastic Policy and Admission (SPA) Committee via the Office of Student Affairs (nursinginfo@wayne.edu). If a student has already registered for a course in the College of Nursing (CON), deferment is not an option. If the request is denied, the offer of admission will be rescinded. Financial aid and tuition support are not automatically deferred and fees already paid are typically not subject to refund. Readmission Nursing students whose attendance in the nursing clinical sequence of the undergraduate curriculum has been interrupted for more than one academic year must request reinstatement to the College of Nursing. Contact the College of Nursing Office of Student Affairs for application materials and deadline dates. There is no assurance that a student can be reinstated once the student withdraws from the program or does not progress in the program within the specified time limitations.
