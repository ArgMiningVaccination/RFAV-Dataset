Detox works on the cellular level, promoting the body to use its own natural healing system in fighting disease. Detoxification improves your overall health, restores your vitality, and rids your body of dangerous substances. Detoxifying helps to improve your health, improve your quality of life, and prevent disease by nourishing the body with proper nutrients and removing dangerous toxins from the body. Your body could be burdened by high levels of dangerous toxins, which interfere with the proper functioning of its systems. Toxic substances damage your DNA and other cellular components on the molecular level. Toxins also prevent vital nutrients from being properly absorbed by your body. This leads to a serious chemical imbalance in your body systems and may cause organ and tissue damage. High levels of toxins in the body may lead to the following: Aches & Pains Digestive Disorders Mood Disorders Sexual Disorders Skin Problems Sleep Disorders The human body naturally removes many toxins on its own. But in these modern times, we are surrounded by such enormous quantities of environmental toxins that the body may be overwhelmed with the ability to cleanse itself. Toxins come from both external and internal sources. EXTERNAL SOURCES OF TOXINS Acid Rain Alcohol Cigarettes Environmental Toxins Heavy Metals Herbicides Illicit Drugs Pesticides Pollution Prescription Drugs INTERNAL SOURCES OF TOXINS Diminished Kidney Function Diminished Liver Function Free Radicals Oxidation Of Cholesterol Oxidation Of Fats PROFESSIONAL MEDICAL TREATMENT Any detoxification / replenishment treatment should be conducted by an experienced physician, who will evaluate your existing medical condition first before running a variety of tests to determine your toxic levels.

You should consult a medical professional to ensure optimal health results and minimize side effects. HOLISTIC APPROACH TO DETOXIFICATION When combined with changes in diet, increased levels of exercise, and lifestyle modifications, detoxification can have a positive impact on your health, help you feel younger and look better, and improve your quality of life.
