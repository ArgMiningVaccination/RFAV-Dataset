The NFR-CRS is available to states and local sites from the National Center for Fatality Review & Prevention (NCFRP) and requires a data use agreement for data entry. The purpose is to collect comprehensive information from multiple a gencies participating in a review. The NFR-CRS documents demographics, the circumstances involved in the death, investigative actions, services provided or needed, key risk factors and actions recommended and/or taken by the team to prevent other deaths. While this data collection form is an import ant part of the CDR process, it should not be the central focus of the review meeti ng. Experienced users have found that it works best to assign a person to record data while the team discussions are occurring. Persons should not attempt to answer every single question in a step-by-step manner as part of the team discussion. It is not expected that teams will have answers to all of the ques tions related to a death. However, over time teams begin to understand the importance of data collection and bring the necessary information to the meeting. The percentage of cases marke d \"unknown\" and unanswered questions decreases as the team becomes more familiar with the form. The NFR-CRS Data Dictionary is available . It contains definitions for each data element and should be referred to when the team is unsure how to answer a question. Use of the data dictionary helps teams improve consistency of data entry.The form contains three types of questions: (1) select one response as represented by a circle; (2) select multiple responses as represented by a square; and (3) free text responses. This last type is indicated by the words \"specify\" or \"describe.\"Many teams ask what is the difference between leaving a question blank and selecting the response \"unknown.\" A question shoul d be marked \"unknown\" if an attempt was made to find the answer but no clear or satisfactory response was obtained. A question should be left blank (unanswered) if no attempt was made to find the answer. \"N/A\" stands for \"not applicable\" and should be used if the question does not apply. Reminder: Enter identifiable information ( names, dates, addresses, counties ) into the NFR-CRS if your state/local policy allows. Follow your state laws in regards to reporting psychological, substance abuse and HIV/AIDS status. Please check with your fatality reviewcoordinator if you are unsure. For other text fields, such as the Narrative section or any \"specify\" or ''describe\" fields, do not include specific names, dates of birth, dates of death, references to specific counties, practitioners, or facility namesin these text fields. Examples: \"Evans County EMS\" be \"the children 's hospital.\" Why this reminder? Text fields may be shared with approved researchers as noted in the Data Use Agreement in your stateor jurisdiction. Therefore, entering identified data into those fields would compromise your responsibility under HIPAA. Additional paper forms can be ordered from the NCFRP at no charge. Users interested in participating in the NFR-CRS for dataentr y and reporting should contact the NCFRP. This version in cludes the Sudden and Unexpected Infant Death (SUID) Case Registry and the Sudden Death in the Young (SDY) Case Registry questions.
