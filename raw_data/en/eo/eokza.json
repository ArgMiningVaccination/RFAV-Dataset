Ayurvedic medicine aims to prevent illness\u2014rather than respond to disease\u2014by maintaining this balance. Ayurvedic herbs have been studied in clinical trials for conditions like the following: Anxiety Osteoarthritis Low testosterone High cholesterol This article discusses some potential benefits of 12 Ayurvedic herbs. It also looks at drug interactions, side effects, and other things you should consider when taking these herbs. Remember that this information summarizes recent scientific evidence about these products and is not exhaustive. Warning Ayurvedic herbs, particularly those used for rasa shastra or \"detoxification,\" often include high levels of toxic heavy metals. Studies have found that 20%-65% of Ayurvedic herbs online contain more than the acceptable daily amounts of the following toxic heavy metals: Lead Mercury Arsenic Taking these contaminated supplements can increase your risk of heavy metal toxicity (e.g., lead or mercury poisoning). If given to children, contaminated supplements can contribute to irreparable harm, including the following: Intellectual disability Neurocognitive disorders (brain and nerve disorders that lead to issues with how one thinks) Behavioral disorders Respiratory conditions Cancer Cardiovascular disease To help ensure quality and safety, consider these steps: Select carefully: Buy your Ayurvedic herbs from a reputable manufacturer with an established market presence. Verify health claims: Don't be swayed by the assertion that \"natural\" treatments are inherently better or any health claims that may or may not be accurate. Talk to your healthcare provider: Use your best judgment and always keep your healthcare provider in the loop about any integrative therapies or supplements you take. While herbs may have some benefits, self-treating a medical condition or avoiding or delaying standard medical care can have serious consequences. Amla (Indian Gooseberry) Amla is a fruit with antioxidant properties high in ascorbic acid (vitamin C) and polyphenols. It may decrease the following major lipids: Triglycerides Total cholesterol Low-density lipoprotein (LDL, or \"bad\") cholesterol Additionally, amla can lower what's known as the atherogenic index of plasma, a ratio of triglycerides to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL, or \"good\" cholesterol). Decreasing this ratio is associated with a lower risk of heart disease. Amla may reduce blood glucose and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, a marker of inflammation. And it's been shown to decrease the symptoms and severity of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) by almost 50% compared to placebo. Ashwagandha (Withania somnifera) Ashwagandha, also known as Indian ginseng or winter cherry, has been studied for many conditions. Research suggests it can improve brain functions like attention and reaction time. Ashwagandha has also been shown to reduce anxiety and levels of the stress hormone cortisol. It is believed to act as an adaptogen, a substance that helps protect the body from stress. And because ashwagandha may boost testosterone levels in males by 15% or more, it is also touted to improve male sexual health. Brahmi (Bacopa monnieri) Brahmi is a purple flowering herb commonly used to improve memory and cognition (thinking). Some studies have found that participants who took brahmi saw an improved ability to pay attention and collect, store, and recall information. One small study showed that people with Alzheimer's disease benefited from taking 600 milligrams of brahmi daily, but it wasn't compared to a placebo or another treatment. Cardamom (Elettaria cardamomum) Cardamom is an herb in the ginger family that contains antioxidants and anti-inflammatory compounds. It can be used during pregnancy to alleviate nausea and vomiting. It's also been studied for possible metabolic benefits, but the results were inconclusive. One review determined that taking cardamom for up to three months may help with glucose metabolism but had no effect on body mass index (BMI), weight, or waist circumference. Cardamom may also help lower blood pressure in people with metabolic syndrome, though more robust trials are needed to confirm this. Guggul (Commiphora mukul) Guggul is a gum resin made from drying the sap of Commiphora or Boswellia shrubs. It has traditionally been used for arthritis, diabetes, and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). In studies, guggul decreased total cholesterol levels by over 6% and LDL cholesterol by 10%. Research shows that lowering cholesterol by 10% translates to a 38% lower risk of heart events at age 50. Guggul has also been shown to increase HDL (\"good\") cholesterol levels, which can protect the heart. Garlic (Allium sativum) A common culinary spice, garlic is an Ayurvedic herb that has been shown to lower total and LDL cholesterol levels by around 5-6% in people with high cholesterol. It may also help decrease blood pressure and fasting blood sugar, and protect against cancer. Guduchi (Tinospora cordifolia) Guduchi, also called giloy, is used in Indian folk medicine to treat diabetes, stomachache, jaundice, urinary problems, and dysentery. Guduchi has been studied as an add-on therapy to aid recovery from COVID-19, for diabetes management, and to alleviate the effects of alcohol use disorder. However, more research is needed to confirm its effects on these conditions. Neem (Azadirachta indica) Also known as \"nature's drug store,\" neem has potent antioxidant effects. It may help prevent or treat cancer, although more information is needed to verify its effects. It has shown benefits for skin conditions, including psoriasis. It may also act as a contraceptive at different points in the reproductive process to prevent pregnancy, but more research is needed. Some weak studies suggest that neem is about as effective as chlorhexidine mouthwash in reducing dental plaque in people with gingivitis. Shatavari (Asparagus racemosus) In Ayurveda, shatavari is a Rasyana herb used to maintain homeostasis (balance in the body) and slow aging. Translated as \"able to have one hundred husbands,\" shatavari has traditionally been used to promote lactation and increase fertility. It may help with infertility, hormonal imbalances, and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), but more clinical evidence is needed. Shatavari has also been studied for its effect against Alzheimer's Disease and viruses like COVID-19. However, more study is needed. Turmeric (Curcuma longa) Turmeric is a plant in the ginger family used to make curry powder. Some research says turmeric may provide therapeutic benefits for skin health as an oral supplement or topical (on the skin) application. Turmeric and its active ingredient, curcumin, may be as effective as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicines (NSAIDs) for joint pain, function, and stiffness in people with osteoarthritis (OA). Research suggests it should be used for at least 12 weeks for this indication. Another review found that turmeric may decrease inflammation due to OA and other types of arthritis, such as ankylosing spondylitis (AS), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and gout. More robust clinical trials are needed to confirm this effect of turmeric. Some research also suggests that adding curcumin to standard treatments for depression can reduce symptoms. Triphala Triphala is not one Ayurvedic herb but a botanical formula that contains three different ones: Terminalia belliricaTerminalia chebulaEmblica officinalis (Amla) Thriphala is primarily used in Ayurveda for disorders of the gastrointestinal tract, but most of the data supporting this use comes from animal studies. Limited research suggests that triphala may decrease some people's cholesterol, triglycerides, blood sugar, weight, and BMI. However, more large clinical trials are needed to confirm this. Triphala may also be used for dental conditions like cavities, gingivitis, and thrush. Tulsi (Holy Basil) Tulsi has been studied in small clinical trials for its effects on cognitive function. In one, it was shown to improve symptoms of stress by 39% versus placebo (a sugar pill with no medicine). In another, it decreased reaction time and rate of error when given to healthy male volunteers. According to limited clinical trials, it may also boost the immune system's response to infections, decrease asthma symptoms, and lower blood sugar levels. More data is needed to confirm these effects. Supplement use should be individualized and vetted by a healthcare professional, such as a registered dietitian nutritionist (RD or RDN), pharmacist, or healthcare provider. No supplement is intended to treat, cure, or prevent disease. Dosage Dosage varies depending on the herb used and the condition it's being used for. Ayurvedic herbs have been studied in clinical trials at the following doses: Amla: 500 milligrams (mg) twice a day for cholesterol; 1000 mg twice a day for GERDAshwagandha: 300 mg twice a day for brain function or anxietyBrahmi: 250 to 600 mg a day for memoryCardamom: 3 grams (g) a day for metabolismGuggul: 200 mg, in combination with other herbal supplements, three times a day for blood sugar and cholesterolGarlic: 800 mg a day for cholesterolGuduchi: 100 milliliters (mL) extract once daily for alcohol use disorderNeem: 1 to 5 mL oil inserted into the vagina to prevent pregnancy or for vaginal infectionsShatavari: 1 g a day for handgrip strengthTurmeric: 100 mg a day for joint painTriphala: 5 g twice a day for blood sugarTulsi: 300 mg a day for brain function Your healthcare provider, a pharmacist, or a registered dietitian can work with you to determine an appropriate dose if you try one of these herbs. Safety Avoid Ayurvedic herbs if you're allergic to them or their components (parts). Seek immediate medical attention if you have a severe allergic reaction (itching, hives, shortness of breath). Side Effects Any herb can cause unwanted side effects. Some side effects of some of the herbs listed include: Amla: Constipation Ashwagandha: Sleepiness, stomach pain, diarrhea, and rarely, liver damage Brahmi: Diarrhea, nausea, stomach cramps Cardamom: Diarrhea, skin inflammation, glossitis (inflamed tongue) Guggul: Headache, skin rash, diarrhea Garlic: Bad breath, body odor, allergic reactions, increased risk of bleeding Guduchi: Liver injury Neem: Liver toxicity, metabolic acidosis, and encephalopathy at high doses (in children); may cause infertility Shatavari: Pink eye, skin reaction, cough Turmeric: Upset stomach Tulsi: Nausea Avoid long-term use of Ayurvedic herbs unless under the guidance of a qualified healthcare provider. Ideally, your provider will perform specific blood tests to check how your body responds to the herb(s), including: Liver enzymes Kidney function Complete blood cell count Stop treatment and call your healthcare provider if you experience any side effects after taking an Ayurvedic herb. Bring your herbs and supplements to your healthcare provider or the emergency room, so they can review what you take. This will help your healthcare provider determine your best course of treatment. Interactions A complete list of possible drug interactions is not possible, but here are a few drugs known to interact with some of these herbs: Amla: Antiplatelets such as clopidogrel (Plavix) Ashwagandha: Medicines for diabetes and high blood pressure, immunosuppressants, thyroid medications, epilepsy medications, and sedatives Brahmi: Antidepressants, anxiety medicines, and seizure medicines like phenobarbital Guggul: Drugs broken down by including midazolam or estradiol Turmeric: Blood thinners, heart medicines, antibiotics, antidepressants, and anti-cancer drugs Tulsi: Diabetes medications To avoid these risks, inform your healthcare provider and pharmacist if you are using or intend to use an Ayurvedic remedy. Even still, remember that there is still much that is not known about herbal remedies. Precautions Due to the lack of quality research, some people should avoid these options. For the most part, Ayurvedic herbs have not been proven safe for the following groups: ChildrenPregnant or breastfeeding people It is not known how Ayurvedic herbs may impact a chronic medical condition. Verywell / Anastasia Tretiak Dietary supplements are not regulated like drugs in the United States, meaning the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) does not approve them for safety and effectiveness before products are marketed. When possible, choose a supplement tested by a trusted third party, such as the Unites States Pharmacopeia (USP), ConsumerLab, or NSF.org. However, even if supplements are third-party tested, that doesn't mean they are necessarily safe for all or effective in general. Therefore, talking to your healthcare provider about any supplements you plan to take and checking in about potential interactions with other supplements or medications is essential. Summary Practitioners use Ayurvedic herbs as part of a traditional Indian healing system. Some studies have found that certain herbs may benefit people with inflammation, high cholesterol, and skin disorders. However, the evidence is conflicting and limited, so more research is needed. Side effects of Ayurvedic herbs may include gastrointestinal problems and allergic rash when applied to the skin. The following groups should avoid Ayurvedic herbs: ChildrenPregnant or breastfeeding people Always consult your healthcare provider before taking any kind of supplement.
