If you're fascinated by the therapeutic power of plants, what better place to start your natural herbal remedies journey than venturing out to find the free healing herbs growing on your doorstep? If you go out and forage for herbs, you're following in the footsteps of your ancestors, who were able to identify herbs for healing. We've been using healing plants for over 60,000 years, and until fairly recently in human history, herbs represented one of the most important forms of medicine. Although many don't realise it, herbal plants still highly influence pharmacy shelves. The pharmaceutical world turns to the plant kingdom to source useful new chemicals for medicines, and up to 40% of pharmaceutical medications are derived from plants. What is a Healing Herb? Look at a list of medicinal herbs; you may be surprised by the variety of plants. From rainforest fruits to common garden weeds, helpful healing herbs grow across the planet in all sorts of habitats. You can identify herbs as any plant demonstrating a useful therapeutic or healing action. This means that the dandelions that tenaciously force their way up between the cracks in the pavement are herbs, as are the leaves of the raspberry plants at pick-your-own berry farms and the nettles that greet you with their infamous sting. Healing herbs can produce therapeutic actions because they contain chemicals known as active constituents. The type of healing that a herb can perform depends upon the \"recipe\" of active constituents present within the plant. Some of the active constituents found within herbs can alter how prescribed medications are processed in the body. So, if you pick herbs from your neighbourhood to use at home, ensure they are compatible with any pharmaceuticals you take. Learn how to identify herbs, and you can spend many happy hours in your locality, finding free natural herbal remedies that can be used to elevate your health. Invest in a good plant identification book and an app on your phone to always confirm two positive identifications before picking and using a herb.
