Factors ob- served to have potential to facilitate healing include psycholog-ical reassurance gained through incorporating familiar religiousbeliefs and paraphernalia and the therapeutic healing propertyof features of curanderismo practice, such as herbs used in many remedies. Negative effects may result from feelings of distrust, fear, and embarrassment engendered by seeking care from acurandero/a.

Key words: Curanderismo, Roman icine, Mexican Americans (Explore 2013; 9:150-158. \u00a9 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.) INTRODUCTION Curanderismo is an integral part of Mexican-American culture, encompassing religious, spiritual, and health-related beliefs andrituals. This indigenous healing practice invokes feelings of faith,hope, condence, and happiness for some and of fear, distrust,embarrassment, and confusion for others. Because of conflictingperspectives between participants in curanderismo and nonprac- ticing Mexican Americans, such as Roman Catholic clergy, thepresent study was conceived as an effort to document how thesereligious elements are incorporated into the work of curand- eros/as and the experiences of their clients. It is hoped that through identication of these features, scholars and healthcareprofessionals\u2014and clergy, for that matter\u2014may gain a better un-derstanding of a major system of healing, care-giving, and spiri-tual advice that exists parallel to respective mainstream systemswithin Mexican-American culture. The desarrollo (training) of a curandero/a is an arduous process through which candidates become attuned with el don, the gift to heal, believed to come from God. The desarrollo prepares a per- son to properly use prayer and religious paraphernalia in pre-scribed rituals to bring about healing among respective clients. This study documents religious elements within curanderismo, emphasizing the influence of Catholicism in the training andpractice of curanderos/as. First, background is provided on the concept of curanderismo within Mexican-American culture. Sec- ond, a detailed look at desarrollo is provided, including discus- sion of the \"calling\" to enter training. Third, a nosology ofdiseases treated by curanderismo is offered, as well as a partly corresponding classication of specialties which exist amongpracticing curandero/as. Fourth, documentation is provided ofritual practices and symbols intrinsic to curanderismo. Finally, positive and negative outcomes attributed to elements of thepractice as well as their effect on practitioners and clients areexplored. Conclusions from this study were drawn from dataobtained through personal interviews (n /H110058) with practitioners ofcuranderismo (n/H110054), clients of curanderismo (n/H110053), and members of the Roman Catholic clergy (n /H110051). Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, and analyzed for common themesamong respondents. BACKGROUND Curanderismo and Mexican-American Culture In a study of Mexican Americans living in border and nonborder towns, 22% of the sample indicated using traditional folk med-icine in the previous year. 1Most traditional complementary and alternative medical (CAM) therapy performed in Mexican cul-ture, delivered separately or in conjunction with conventionalmedicine, is carried out by a curandero/a. 2Although curandero/as undergo training, strong emphasis is placed on the individual'snatural ability to heal. 3This ability cannot be learned and is seen as a gift from God (el don). Other innate, but possibly learned,attributes are a strong spirituality and harmony with nature.Because curandero/as believe their healing gift comes from God, many curandero/as incorporate religious paraphernalia into the healing process. 4The religious element of the practice is alluring to participants. In a previous study, religiosity was found to bepositively related to both mainstream and traditional CAM useamong foreign-born Hispanics living in the United States. 5 The use of curandero/as is not universally accepted among Mexican Americans because it is seen by some to be contrary toRoman Catholic belief and/or a scam (R. Trevino, personalcommunication, 2010). Although curanderismo is deeply rooted in Roman Catholicism, the practice is often equated with bruje- ria(black magic), and many outsiders view the practice through the lens of cultural stereotyping. 6Because people typically use curanderismo treatments in lieu of visiting a healthcare profes-1 Baylor University, Waco, TX #Corresponding Author.

The promise of a miracle cure, which may not occur, potentially causes partici-pants a loss of money and time and is another cited danger of thepractice. 7 Curanderismo 's Appeal to Participants Despite curanderismo's strong opposition, many individuals still actively seek the help of its practitioners because it is viewed asan easily accessible form of medicine delivered in a culturallyappropriate manner. 8Curandero/as are seen as more trustworthy because many do not charge for their services but instead acceptdonations. In some cases, the curandero/a may not even accept payment. 9The absence of barriers, waiting lists, and other spec- ications also serves to attract clients.10As one person put it, \"At the very least you feel better. That's why you go. You walk outand you feel better.\" 11Others feel reassurance that the curand- ero/a prays to God or to the saints. Another individual reported, \"The curandera had all types of saints all over her house so I thought at the time I was doing right by God in visiting her\" (J.Garcia, personal communication, 2010). Prayer to a saint for the healing of a particular ailment is a commonly performed practice within curanderismo. In a previ- ous study of older Mexican Americans, authors found a positiveassociation between praying to the saints and stronger God-mediated control beliefs, which in turn were related to betteroptimism and self-rated health. 12Looking at this study, we can infer that the psychological reassurance that may be gained byparticipating in curanderismo may exert a positive impact on the health of participants. Trotter and Chavira 13identied three reasons why curander- ismo is seen as appealing and effective: accessibility, the fact that thecurandero/a takes time to listen to a client's personal prob- lems, and the religious symbols and spiritual practices used tobring about healing. One curandero described the various roles that a curandero/a may ll, what methods are employed, and how these benet clients: The role of a curandero orcurandera can also incorporate the roles of psychiatrist along with that of doctor and healer. Many curanderos use Catholic elements, such as holy water and saint pictures. The use of Catholic prayers and otherborrowings and lendings are often found alongside nativereligious elements. I also assist my clients when they askrecommendations for a candle or picture to satisfy theirneeds. For example if I have a client that is sick of X thingand she wants \"spiritual healing\" I'll recommend her to getsomething with St. Rafael, for example a candle. St. RafaelArchangel is considered to be the \"God of medicine\" so ifSt. Rafael is a healer then what better way than to pray tohim in hard times? (J. Salinas, personal communication,2011). Moreover, curanderos/as are easily accessible because they are often known in the community, experience the same kind of life as their clients, speak the same language, and are usually in thesame economic stratum as their clients. 13The curandero/a is familiar, not exotic, and culturally intrinsic to the client.14Lis- tening to a client's personal problems creates a support systemthat may help to bring about well-being. Further, curanderismouses clients' faith and belief systems, making them feel moreassured that healing will take place. 13 DESARROLLO: TRAINING TO BECOME A CURANDERO/A \"Calling\"As a result of organized opposition, much of curanderismo's wis- dom has been passed down through the generations fromteacher to apprentice in channels outside of oversight by main-stream medicine. 15Although books on the subject available to the general public describe the many maladies that can be curedand the herbs and rituals used to bring about healing, elementsof the practice are said to be incapable of being learned andothers are said to be best learned directly from a trained curand- ero/a. 16 As noted, the ability to practice curanderismo is seen to be a gift from God. People may determine whether they have the gift orfeel a calling to the practice in a variety of ways. Individuals maybe called by being told by a practicing curandero/a that they too have the gift, advised by spirits through dreams, or may feelcalled after engaging in the practice of curanderismo. In an interview with a practicing curandero of more than 30 years, Alfonso (name changed) shared that he was told at age 7by a curandera that he possessed a healing gift. As he felt no yearning to become a curandero, he thought nothing of the com- ment at the time. In his twenties he visited another curandera, who read tarot cards for him. Upon viewing the rst card she aswell eagerly told him that he had the gift to heal and urged himto develop and sharpen his skills. However, he wanted nothingto do with the practice other than to get his problem xed. Onceagain at the age of 27 and after losing his job, he visited a spiritmedium, where he again felt a calling to become a curandero: There was this young girl, 16 years old from Mexico, who started swinging back and forth and going into a deeptrance and going to sleep. She swung like a butterfly andwaved her arms like angel wings. She was like floating. It wasbeautiful. She walked toward me, the spirit in her spoke tome, but I couldn't hear her because of the chanting. Afterve times of repeating I understood what she said. She saidI needed to do a lot of prayer. But a holy spirit came into meand I felt changed. It was a beautiful and overwhelmingpeace. I kept wanting it. The session ended that day and weleft. I wanted more. I felt I had a calling. I asked who thisspirit was and it said it was Ni\u00f1o Fidencio (A. Gracia, per-sonal communication, 2010). El as his followers the Fidencistas ami- ably call him, is a highly revered curandero, who is channeled by practicing curanderos today. 17Many curanderos will say that their calling into practice came about in a similar manner as the aforementioned one, in which a channeled spirit will speak tothem and tell them they have a gift. A very popular curandera in the 1930s who went by the name \"Mother Lane\" revealed that she was told she had el don after the death of her sister. Soon after the death, she began to hear hername called out in the middle of the night by a female voice. Shewas later instructed through a dream to leave a sheet of paper and 151 Religious Features of Curanderismo Training and Practice EXPLORE May/June 2013, Vol. 9, No. 3a pencil on the table before going to bed. Upon awaking she discovered a message written on the note from her deceasedsister telling her not to worry for she had a gift from God to heal.Mother Lane said that from that day, she began to fall intotrances guiding her healing rituals. When removing a needlefrom the knee of a friend, she fully discovered she had el don, and felt her calling to practice curanderismo was reafrmed. 18 Miguel Flores, a practicing curandero in California, stated he felt called to the practice of curanderismo after being cured of a stomach malady as a small child. With encouragement from hisparents, he enrolled in a month-long course in physiotherapy,where he was taught about massage. He then returned to NewMexico, where he was an apprentice under several older Mexi-can-American folk healers. 19 TrainingNo matter what the inspiration is to become a curandero/a, there is a framework of training that most apprentices follow to be-come a trained folk healer. The training of a curandero/a is known as desarrollo (development/growth). Training varies ac- cording to the specialization of the curandero/as, who may spe- cialize in more than one area and thus may work on more than one \"level.\" The three main levels under which curandero/as work are the material, mental, and spiritual. 13 Regarding the spiritual level, it is said that an individual may be prone to work on this level if they are born in the months of February or August or if a curandero/a lays hands on them and senses their spirits. If the curandero/a senses \"tight\" vibrations in the individual's spirit, the person is deemed qualied to work inthe spiritual realm. Another test is to have the apprentice engagein direct contact with the spiritual realm, and determine theircapability from the strength of that interaction. 13 Once it has been determined that the individual is able to work in the spiritual realm, it is time to begin the desarrollo. Possessing el don and not using it is very dangerous, as the indi- vidual is believed to have a brain that is vulnerable to spirit communication and possession yet does not have the knowl-edge of how to protect it. For this reason, it is important for thetrainee to be under the guidance of a fully trained spiritualistbecause he or she is capable of safely opening up new spiritualchannels into the trainee's brain. The trained spiritualist serves asa gatekeeper to the person's body, taking guard over it when theindividual leaves his or her body and regulates which spirits canenter. 13 The individual's training involves making more and more con- tact with the spiritual world by engaging in controlled trances andpossessions. More importantly, the individual also gains the knowl-edge necessary to protect himself or herself while practicing theserituals. No two individuals' desarrollo will be the same, however, as each person's experiences affect their perceptions and evoke differ-ent states of consciousness. When the apprentice has reached acertain point, they will invoke their rst spirit. As the apprenticeprogresses in their desarrollo they will be able to interact and talk with others more easily while in their trance. 13 The desarrollo will differ for individuals working on different levels. The training is said to be the easiest for the material levelas it entails manipulating everyday items to produce an atmo-sphere conducive to treatment. These actions alter the client'sawareness of the situation to bring about healing. The hardest and rarest level to be worked in is the mental because training issaid to be the most extensive and rigorous. Although the work ofcurandero/as working on this level is said to include the least rituals and is the least visible, their work is said to be the mostextensive. The mental and spiritual levels are said to be similar asboth levels use what are called \"mental vibrations,\" but themental level relies solely on the power of the individual's mindrather than on its relationship to any discarnate entities. A per-son working on this level is said to be able to diagnose an illnessby observing the size, shape, and color of the person's aura or byusing mental telepathy or mental readings. 13Alfonso, a curand- erowho claims to work on all three levels, when asked if it was true that the mental level was the hardest to learn and operatereplied that all three are equally hard to him (A. Gracia, personalcommunication, 2010). Modern-Day Curanderos New avenues of training are presently offered for those individ- uals who would like to pursue a \"career\" in curanderismo. For example, Eliseo \"Cheo\" Torres has taught a two-week course on curanderismo entitled \"Traditional Medicine Without Borders: Curanderismo in the Southwest and Mexico,\" serving more than 200 students at the University of New Mex-ico. The course invites local healers and health practitioners aswell as healers from Mexican cities and communities to sharetheir knowledge and experiences with students. The course hasencouraged discussions surrounding the concept of integratingtraditional and conventional medicine to better serve the needsof the patient. 20 Another institution offering training to students is El Centro de Desarollo Humano, located in Cuernavaca, Mexico, and directedby Dr Arturo Ornelas. As part of the curriculum, students are nottaught curanderismo practices through lectures but rather by treating themselves and others to gain a better understanding and masteryof the healing art. 21Kalpulli Teocalli Ollin, an organization that promotes traditional ancestral healing practices, also offers coursessuch as \"Curanderismo Around the World: Celtic, Jewish, andNative American\" and \"Healing Touch Class: Using Our Senses inCuranderismo\" at the University of New Mexico and incorporateshands-on teaching exercises. 22 Besides such structured programs seeking to train future curand- eros, the practice is gaining greater acceptance within conventionalmedicine. Molina Healthcare of New Mexico is a regional healthplan that covers traditional healing services for Native Americans. 23 Curanderismo has also been incorporated into multispecialty aca- demic medical clinics, exemplied by the University of New Mex-ico's Center for Life, which describes itself as an \"Integrative andInter-Cultural Center for Prevention and Wellness\" that featuresboth ancient and modern techniques of healing. 24 ESPECIALIZACI\u00d3N : PRACTICE SPECIALTIES AMONG CURANDEROS/AS NosologyAccording to curanderismo, some illnesses are caused by an im- balance of the humors of the body. Some believe illness cancome from an imbalance of the calidades (qualities) of the body 152 EXPLORE May/June 2013, Vol. 9, No. 3 Religious Features of Curanderismo Training and Practicein which foods and medicines classied as \"hot\" or \"cold\" are used to restore balance.25Nevertheless, most curandero/as be- lieve illnesses derive from physical, emotional, or soul dysfunc-tion. 15That is, curandero/as believe that there needs to be bal- ance and harmony in the emotional, physical, and social aspectsof a person's life. 25Although curandero/as generally favor a ho- listic view of medicine, many recognize conventional categoriesof illness and will refer an individual whom they believe to be inneed of medical attention to a physician. 26 One of the major premises of curanderismo is that body and soul are inseparable. Thus, within curanderismo it is believed that if the soul is \"lost\" from the body, this will result in great ill-ness. 25This concept is fundamental to the understanding of health and illness among curandero/as and particularly to their understanding of mental health and psychiatric disorders. It isbelieved that a person's spirit acts as a guardian of the individu-al's mental health, and if the spirit fails to do so, the individual'ssoul is greatly affected. Most commonly the dysfunction is per-ceived to be an excess of emotions such as envy, rage, or sad-ness. 27 Another major premise of curanderismo is that mind and body are inseparable, as well. Accordingly, there is no dichotomybetween emotional or somatic illnesses. In treating illnesses,curandero/as do not treat the mind and body separately but rather simultaneously treat both in their healing practice. A fur-ther premise of curanderismo is that the client is always innocent of malevolent forces in the environment. An individual is notblamed for being ill; moreover, the illness is seen to be a disrup-tion of internal or external forces, which may be spoken of as an\"attack.\" One variation of this belief is that illness may comefrom an internal disruption due to an individual's transgressions.In such cases, social support is needed, as well as help from thesaints or God and from a curandero/a. 25 Curandero/as believe that health and illness contain a duality of naturally and supernaturally caused illnesses. Natural causesinclude the germ theory, genetic disorders, psychological condi- tions, and dietary causes for medical problems. These maladiesare best treated by visiting a physician or using herbs. Supernat-ural causes for diseases include soul disorders or etiologies of amagical or unexplained nature. 4A third category used to cate- gorize illness in curanderismo is the psychological or interper- sonal origin of disease.28A comprehensive nosology of diseases recognized within curanderismo is presented in Table 1. Physical diseases that are thought to be of natural origin in- clude mal aire (\"bad air\"), which is caused by exposures drafts night air. Empacho (\"intestinal obstruction\") is bloating, con- stipation, and loss of appetite due to food being lodged in the intestinal wall. Mollera caida (\"fallen fontanel\") is colic, loss of appetite, and loss of the ability to suck due to the fontanel cavingin on the soft palate. 28 Illnesses under the psychological category include melarchico (\"melancholy\"), brought about by being separated from a lovedone. It is accompanied by extreme depression, insomnia, andloss of appetite. Susto (\"fright\") is insomnia, irritability, depres- sion, and nightmares caused by emotional shock. 28Latido is an illness we would equate with anorexia, as it is dened as anindividual going a prolonged amount of time without eating.Illnesses brought on by anger include bilis and muina. Bilis is believed to result from suppressed anger causing a bile to formand flow through the person's inner system causing headaches,stomach ills, and loss of appetite. Muina is thought to be more serious and is caused by an outward display of rage rather thansuppressed anger. 29 Diseases that fall under the supernatural category include ill- nesses such as encono (\"festering wounds\"), an infection of an open wound caused by a person who has, more commonly,unintentionally caused the wound to fester. Another malady ismal ojo (\"evil eye\"), a sudden illness brought on to a child due to the admiration of a person with \"strong eyes.\" Lastly, malecioTable 1.

When asked what most people sought help for from him, Alfonso replied that most peoplewanted help with intangible problems. They wanted help withproblems of life, and found comfort in talking to someone andreceiving attention for their problem (A. Gracia, personal com-munication, 2010). In a survey of 100 Mexican-born individualsliving in Santa Ana, of a total of 50 curandero/a consultations among the group, 21 were for mal puesto, 8 for susto, 4 for empa- cho, 2 for chest pain, 2 for help in nding a missing relative, andthe remaining 13 for problems such as alcoholism, infertility,and marital problems. It is evident from this study that peopleperceive curandero/as to have a wide range of powers. 19Another study explored 300 consultations with a practicing curandero, who cited problems ranging from colds and flu to seeking helpfor troubled family members, nding a job, help with winning acourt case, and getting rid of bad luck. 30 SpecializationMost curandero/as are able to treat a large variety of illnesses because they may specialize in more than one area ( Table 2). The main specialist categories among curandero/as include, as noted, yerbero/a (herbalist), sobador/a (massager), espiritualisto/a (psy- chic medium), and se\u00f1or/a (tarot card reader). Other specialties include huesero/a, a specialist in bones, and partera (midwife). Each of these specialties includes individuals who may work onone or more of the levels (material, mental, spiritual) within theirspecialty. 13 PR\u00c1CTICAS RITUALES : SYMBOLS AND RITUALS OF CURANDEROS/AS Common RitualsFor each ailment that a client may present, curanderismo species a specialized manner of curing the illness. In many instances,formal Roman Catholic elements inform or dene the ritual. Forexample, in the case of mal ojo, the sick person is laid on his or her back with the arms extended at the side. The individual isthen covered with a white bed sheet or blanket (white to signifypurity) and the curandero sweeps over the body using an egg three times while praying the Apostles' Creed. The egg is then brokenand put into a glass of water while a cross made out of a palm leafis placed in front of the glass. It is said that if the client issuffering from the evil eye and is cured, then an eye will form onthe egg. 31It has been the experience of one of the present au- thors that the Apostles' Creed is not always prayed, but ratherthe individual will pray their own prayer or another prayer.Nevertheless, an egg is always used in this ritual and it is alwaysplaced in a cup to determine whether the individual has beenhealed. Other modications may be that the curandero prays over the individual using holy water. Empacho is cured with the use of holy water, but it has also been observed by one of the authors that curandero/as may use olive oil. The person's stomach is rubbed using the holy water inorder to nd the obstruction in their intestine. The person isthen laid on their stomach in order to pull the skin on their backuntil a popping sound is heard. The popping sound signies thatthe object has been dislodged, and the individual is then given ateaspoon of olive oil with salt and a tea, which helps regulatetheir digestive system. During the ritual, the Apostles' Creed, theOur Father, and the Hail Mary are all prayed. 31 Instructions to pray to a particular saint are typically received from a curandero/a in order to help bring about healing or alle- viate a specic problem. In addition, herbs are prescribed to curerespective ailments or to help alleviate tension. For example,when one woman asked for advice on how to cope with thedeath of her mother, the response was to pray to the La Virgen deGuadalupe and to St Joseph, the patron saint of the dead, dying,and those seeking a happy death. The woman was also instructedto sprinkle her mother's room with holy water, to keep freshroses on hand, and to have her mother receive Last Rites fromthe Catholic Church. 30 Incorporation of Religious SymbolsReligious paraphernalia, herbs, and other symbolic items areused in conjunction with prayer to bring about healing withincuranderismo rituals. When asked if these items were necessary, all of the interviewed curanderos/as stated that they felt that prayer was sufcient. Nevertheless, they saw a benet in havingthese other items present, specically to reinforce the faith ofclients: People like you and me know that you only need to pray to God to get your prayer answered, but these people don'tbelieve that. Our society has been idolaters since the begin-ning of time. People need to see something in front of themto believe. All these candles and powders and saints are alla form of therapy. Like when I give people the perfume forBingo they come back later and tell me that they wonbecause of that perfume. I know that this is not true, and Itell them that they won because they had a positive attitudeand they prayed to God. They argue and insist that I sellthem the perfume so I sell it to them. I believe God is theonly person that you need to pray to (D. Maria, personalcommunication, 2011). I feel that everyone is entitled to their own faith and beliefs. I certainly agree that prayer is very strong in my personalTable 2.

Salinas, personalcommunication, 2011). Other Roman Catholic Syncretisms The complexity of comingling Roman Catholic and native in-fluences in curanderismo is not without precedent in other Me- soamerican traditions. Indeed, some of the same concepts andthemes can be observed. The practice of Santer\u00eda, a syncreticreligion of West African and Caribbean origin popular in Cuba,also makes use of Roman Catholic concepts by incorporatingthe use of saints into their practice. During ceremonies, an altarwith an image of Christ and pictures of various saints is placed ina central place. The Yoruba slaves believed that beyond thesupreme god there were the Siete Potencias (The Seven Powers).These spirits were believed to be archangels of their god Oludo-mare, and were called Orishas. Many of the Orishas were iden-tied with several Christian saints or angels. The prayers andmodes of address used by the santeros (Santer\u00edan priests) are quite similar to those used in Roman Catholicism. One example readsas follows: Hail to Oya, our Orisha, with her crown of light. Here is Oya, lady of the wind and rain. Hail to her as she travelsover the forests and hills. All praise to her for she is themother of nine. Earthly winds, bring us health. Heavenlywinds, bring us great fortune. Our lady of the winds iswonderful. Amen so let it be amen. Our lady of the sunset,you paint for us the leaves of autumn. We hear your song atdusk and dawn. 32 The symbolic use of candles is also present in Santer\u00eda, which also incorporates Catholic saints.32In Christianity, the candle is used to remind believers that Jesus Christ is the light of the world and that Jesus is present among his worshipers. In Santer\u00eda, thecandle is used in spells and enchantments because it gives thewizard indications of good or bad things during the ritual. 32 Healing rituals in Santer\u00eda compare with those of curander- ismo: for example, the saints, Orishas, are called on to help bringhealing to the patient. Santer\u00edan rituals as well make use ofmusic, dancing, and hypnosis. One Orisha in particular, Orsain,is seen as the Orishan doctor, who is associated with Saint Johnand Saint Ambrose. He is thought to have all the medicinalplants and herbs under his power. Santer\u00edan rituals also make useof herbal remedies. An important herb used in Santer\u00eda is ver-vain, which is extremely important in the Christian traditionbecause it is said to have been found growing on Calvary Hilland was used to staunch the wounds of Christ. Another similar-ity between Santer\u00eda and curanderismo is that the rituals do not only address health but other problems such as wealth, prosper-ity, and luck. 32 In Haiti, Roman Catholicism is a potent influence on the practice of vod\u00fan (voodoo), which, too, is derived from African traditions. Similarly to curanderismo, the line between physical and spiritual illness is not drawn, and disease is often seen ascaused by supernatural factors and possessions by spirits. 33 Saints also are incorporated into the practice of vod\u00fan. In Hai- tian vod\u00fan there is a supreme god called Le Bon Dieu, but allworship is given to the laos, which are spirits or divinities. Some of the laoswere Catholic saints. On a vod\u00fan altar there is an array of Catholic paraphernalia including crucixes, rosaries, holy wa-ter, candles, and pictures of Catholic saints. Prayers in vod\u00fan are also very similar to those of Roman Catholicism. An excerpt ofa prayer commonly read in this practice is as follows: Oh, Mary, Mother of Mercy, take pity on these poor, aban- doned souls. Mary Apolita, Mother of God, Mother ofmothers, Mother of Grace, pray for all these convertedsouls, these souls of purgatory. All the saints, all the angels,angels of the heavens . . . come and deliver this poorbrother from tribulation. 34 As with curanderismo, most vod\u00fan practitioners are also mem- bers of the Catholic Church. Vod\u00fan makes use of sacrices, Catholic hymns such as \"There is a King of the Angels,\" holy water, and Catholic prayers such as the Magnicat during itsceremonies. The purpose of the vod\u00fan ceremony is similar to that of curanderismo, whereby the gods are called upon for the worshipers to make requests. 35 Finally, besides the vod\u00fan of Haiti and the Santer\u00eda of Cuba, other Roman Catholic syncretisms with traditional native reli-gious belief and practice coexist with normative Christianitythroughout the Caribbean. These include Cumina-Pukkuminain Jamaica and Shango in Trinidad. 36 KEY ELEMENTS OF CURANDERISMO PRACTICE FaithAlthough faith in God is considered an instrumental part of thehealing process in curanderismo, some say that healing can be brought about without the faith of the patient. Others believethat faith is the most important element of the practice of curan- derismo, and some practitioners fault clients for their disbelief ifhealing does not result. 37Some curanderos/as afrm that the most important element of the practice is the complete faith ofthe client toward the curandero/a practitioner: The faith of the person is not the most important thing but it is one of the most important. One usually tries to instillfaith. If you know the person doesn't have faith and thatthey are being forced to come, then you make it a point tomake them have faith. Sometimes you will have peoplewho have nothing but negative thoughts about curanderos.I remember this one man that was very negative. He was avery hard man until his daughter was demon-possessed. Hewould cry like a baby. He would tell me that he would giveme anything to cure his daughter. He suddenly believedthat I could heal her. Now he believed after this affectedhim personally. When it happens to you then you believe it(A. Gracia, personal communication, 2010). Therapeutic Touching Another important element of the healing process is the thera-peutic property of touch, a concept that has been adopted inrecent years by the nursing profession, although controver-sially. 38Alfonso shared his belief in the power of laying-on-of- hands in gaining trust and a higher level of comfort for the 155 Religious Features of Curanderismo Training and Practice EXPLORE May/June 2013, Vol. 9, No. 3individual. He believed that there was power in the act of touch- ing that could not be explained just by the level of physicalcloseness (A. Gracia, personal communication, 2010). Further-more, rituals incorporating the whole family into the practiceserve to better habilitate healing, as family may be invited toparticipate by use of their hands, as well. Most rituals are practiced in the home of the patient or curan- dero/a, which is typically in the client's neighborhood and thusoffers the client a deep sense of belonging, which may be con-ducive to healing. The status of the curandero/a is also considered an important element in successful healing. The curandero/a must be condent in his/her diagnosis and treatment of theailment. A practicing curandera stated, \"First of all the faith of God is the most important thing in my practice. They also haveto have faith in me that I can carry out God's work, and havefaith in the practice of curanderismo\" (D. Maria, personal com- munication, 2011). The curandero/a gains this faith in their own practice by believing in the healing power of God. 29 Conjuring SpiritsAnother key element of curanderismo practice, particularly for practitioners who work on the spiritual level, is the conjuring ofspirits. Curandero/as may conjure the spirits of celebrities, de- ceased relatives, or the spirits of famous curandero/as.I na ni n - terview conducted with Mary (name changed), a 19-year-oldstudent, she shared that when visiting a curandero he called on the spirit of Ni\u00f1o Fidencio to carry out the healing process: The curandero began to pray to God and he recited the Our Father followed by the Hail Mary. He then lowered his head, and when he raised it once again his eyes were closed,and he began to speak in a child-like voice. He told me thathe was Ni\u00f1o Fidencio, and he asked if I believed in thehealing power of God. . . . He used holy water to anoint meand pray over me. He then acted as if he was taking some-thing out of his pocket but he had nothing in his hand.He said he had a needle and he pretended to pierce his skin.He said he was going to put spiritual blood on my skin.After he pretended to pierce his own skin he pretended topierce my skin and mix his blood with mine. After hecompleted the ritual he wished me the best then lowered hishead. When he raised his head his eyes were open and hisvoice was back to normal (M. Gomez, personal communi-cation, 2010). In another interview, Juan (name changed), a 60-year-old re- tired immigration ofcer, shared his experience with a curandero and a curandera who worked together. The curandera seemed to work on the material level while the curandero, who conjured spirits, appeared to work on the spiritual level: The curandera showed me a room before she was to pray for me using the piece of lamb chop she had asked me to bring. In that room there appeared to be a shrine to the VirginMary and there were many candles on tables and on thefloor in that room. In the center of the room there was aman sitting Indian style on the floor dressed in a light bluerobe. The curandera told me that this man was Ni\u00f1o Fiden- cio and that he would also be praying for me so that I wouldwin my court case. The man appeared to be in a trance,because he was rocking back and forth and he was mutter-ing what seemed like a prayer under his breath (J. Garcia,personal communication, 2010). NEGOTIATING THE WORLDVIEW OF CURANDERISMO Barriers to Client Participation Many of the rituals of curanderismo may seem quite unorthodox to individuals with limited exposure to beliefs and practicesoutside of the norms of Roman Catholic religion and of West-ern medicine. Examples include rubbing eggs over the body,sweeping the body with branches of leaves, burying items in theground, and bathing with special herbs all as ways to cleanse thebody of evil spirits. Another unusual type of cure was describedwhereby a curandero told a young woman to burn incense for seven days to cleanse her house of evil spirits, and to sprinklerice, wheat, and black mustard seed around her house on the rstday of the month to protect her from evil. 30Within curander- ismo, everyday objects such as eggs or lemons are perceived tohold special powers in that they can detract evil spirits from youand your surroundings. 31Although not all potential clients nec- essarily recoil from performing such rituals or actions, as theymay have been exposed to them while growing up and may evenwitnessed perceived benets, some clients do report that thesepractices seem a bit silly. At the same time, this does not neces-sarily prevent seeking out contact with a curandero/a. One client, for example, reported mixed feelings over the ritual he participated in and the items he was asked to bringalong: I felt so silly standing there while she slapped my body with a pork chop, and I felt even worse knowing that I had goneto all these ranches looking for the goose egg she hadwanted I didn't want to go, but I didn't want to risk nothaving my prayer answered (A. Gracia, personal communi-cation, 2010). Why Clients Continue to Participate There are various reasons why a client may continue to seekcontact with a curanderismo practitioner, even despite unsettling feelings or other reservations about participating in such prac-tices. One may experience tangible benets that have not beenreceived from attending church, from praying, or even frommedical practice. One may leave in a better state of mind aftervisiting a curandero/a, or may believe that he or she has received a \"miracle\" cure as a result of curanderismo. Other clients may feel reassured by a perception that the beliefs and rituals that theyexperienced are at least connected to the Roman Catholic reli-gion, and may be comforted by the use of traditional religiousobjects during sessions. Two reasons in particular stand out. Practice Seems Effective. Although some clients may not feel completely comfortable participating in curanderismo, they may return to the practice because of a perception that it is effectivein some cases. This perception may be heightened by severalfactors: many of the rituals of curanderismo aim at relieving an individual's stress, a curandero/a sits and listens to an individual's 156 EXPLORE May/June 2013, Vol. 9, No. 3 Religious Features of Curanderismo Training and Practiceproblem and provides reassurance, and the service being pro- vided is in a comfortable setting and in the client's native lan-guage. All of the elements may encourage a client to continueseeking care. Moreover, it has been shown that some of the herbsused by curanderos/as are indeed efcacious and contain antibac- terial properties, 39so clinical success (and thus satisfaction with care) may be attributable to more than psychosomaticmechanisms. One interviewed client returned to the curandero because of his accuracy despite the fact that the client felt strongly thatsomething may be wrong: I went because everything he said came true, and all his prayers were working. Like one time I got into a car accidentand my wife called him right after. It was like ten minutesafter and he just answered the phone and immediately saidhe already knew about the accident. This scared me. I kindof knew then that something was wrong (R. Trevino, per-sonal communication, 2010). This duality of questioning whether curanderismo is silly or evil\u2014while at the same time trusting that it will work\u2014may con- tribute to an inner struggle participants face when decidingwhether to participate in the practice. It also exemplies whatmay be a common dilemma of clients and patients who haveexperienced any manner of unorthodox complementary or al-ternative medical therapies. Psychological Well-Being. Participants may return for subse- quent visits because of a heightened sense of psychological well-being that they receive from treatment by a curandero/a or from being in their presence. This is exemplied by a curanderismo ritual known as a limpiada espiritual, done to clean a person's aura of negative energy and which has become opaque in color due tocarrying a heavy load from the troubles of life. A main reason forretaining this energy is said to be doubt, which is hard to get ridof and which keeps an individual holding onto feelings of jeal-ousy, anger, and frustration. Harboring such feelings preventsone from attaining tranquility and makes it hard to prepare forlife's required tasks. Receiving a limpiada espiritual, a \"spiritual cleansing,\" enables one to return to life, reawakening the colorsof the aura, and is a means to destroy the negative thoughts thatinhibit normal functioning (J. Salinas, personal communication,2011). In participating in this ritual, the client is led to envisionall negative thoughts being swept away, enabling one to feel as ifhe or she can start life anew. One curandero underscored clearly how a limpiada can be ben- ecial: Most people come to me because they are not happy with their life. They want a limpia for all the bad luck that theyhave. Basically in everything they do nothing comes outright. Life is eating away at them. They are sad. A barrida ora limpia usually helps them. Aroma therapy and prayerhelps with that too. This takes away the negative energy. Iuse the power of prayer, the power of faith, religious arti-cles, invocation of spirits, and healing power of cleanse (A.Gracia, personal communication, 2010).DISCUSSION The psychological reassurance that may be gained from tangiblereligious paraphernalia incorporated into curanderismo practice, the therapeutic property of touch present in many rituals, andthe herbs used in many remedies all have the potential to facil-itate healing for the participant. At the very least, a better state ofmind for healing may result. Multiple roles of doctor, psychia-trist, and religious guide employed by curandero/as may fulll physical, emotional, and spiritual needs of the client. On the other hand, when these practices are used indepen- dently of modern medicine adverse consequences may occur.Negative effects may result from distrust, fear, and embarrass-ment associated with negative perspectives on participation inthe practice. For these reasons, it is imperative that healthcareprofessionals and caregivers gain an awareness of these practices.It would also be useful for professionals to inquire about thesepractices from among their clients in order to preemptively iden-tify any contraindications or risks that might complicate care butthat would be otherwise hidden. Future research might consider examining in-depth the com- plexities of the relationship between Roman Catholicism andcuranderismo, and how this conflicted relationship specicallymay impact on the mental health of participants, both practitio-ners and clients. An especially contentious subject, and one withsome taboo elements among both curanderos/as and clergy, is the subset of curanderismo that involves the Sant\u00edsima Muerte (\"Saint Death\"). Practices associated with this form of curanderismo are considered to dene a dangerous cult; disapproval from theRoman Catholic Church is so great that these practices are par-alleled with Satanism. 40 Recent literature suggests that curanderismo is evolving toward incorporation of biomedical principles within its practice\u2014prin-ciples that thus exist alongside of Roman-Catholic-influencedideas as well as folk medical concepts. Curandero/as are, by na- ture, eclectic and adept at making use of concepts and practicesdrawn from various disciplines and sources, including conven-tional medicine. 41,42Over time, perhaps this will widen the appeal of curanderismo, although it is premature to expect that the medical world will not remain highly opposed. It is difcultto ascertain whether curanderismo will ever be embraced, much as some forms of CAM have been in recent years. But identica-tion of physical, mental, and spiritual etiologies within curand- erismo\u2014and the concomitant treatment modalities\u2014are not in-consistent with current psychosocial theory and research andwould thus recommend this as a subject for clinical and popu-lation health research.
