S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Office of Research and Development has proposed a joint Eco system-Health Research Program to study the links between changes in biodiversity and risks t o human health. NCER has a responsibility to undertake exploratory research on emerging scientific issues, an d forums are organized for these topical discussions. Studying the relationship between biodiversity and human health is a timely research opportunity. The loss of biodiversity is accelerating while infectious diseas es appear to be emerging and reemerging at a faster rate. Research on the links between these two conditions can have an important impact on our view of biodiversity, the services provided by natural ecosystems, and how we manage them. In co-sponsorship with Yale University's Center for EcoE pidemiology, the Smithsonian Institution, and the World Conservation Union, EPA/NCER is convening th is interdisciplinary forum of researchers, practitioners, and decisionmakers in ecology, public health, r emote sensing, and the social sciences. We will discuss the state of the science, refine research priorities, and be gin discussions on how to integrate existing data into a monitoring and risk-forecasting network that aims to prevent or significantly mitigate risks of human disease and threats to biodiversity around the world. The forum will consist of presentations on themes related to biodiversity and human health such as epidemiology and vector ecology; climate change, biodiversity, and health; wildlife trade and the spread of exotics and disease; pharmacopeia; the role of biodiversity in n atural catastrophes; valuation of biodiversity for public health; and applications of research to the Global Earth O bservation System of Systems (GEOSS). These presentations will be part of an outreach effort to scient ists and decisionmakers to stress the importance of the connection between biodiversity and human health and to d iscuss the state of the science. The event brings together experts from a variety of disciplin es, academia, nongovernmental organizations, and management agencies from the United States and abroad to share e xpertise and information and to con- sider new approaches to characterize the relationship between biodiv ersity and human health. This forum is part of a series on contemporary issues related to the environment and health sponsored by the Yale Institute for Biospheric Studies Center for EcoEpidemio logy. The initiative on biodiversity and human health is being led by EPA in partnership with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the Center for Health Applications of Aerospace Related Technologies at the National Aeronautics and Space Administratio n's Ames Research Center, and the Smithsonian Institution. Biodiversity and Human Health: A Multidisciplinary Approach To Examining the Links The Office of Research and Development's National C enter for Environmental Research 2 Biodiversity and Human Health: A Multidisciplinary Approach To Examining the Links September 14, 2006 Executive Summary Around the world, the loss of biodiversity is accelerating, while infectious diseases appear to be emerging and reemerging at a faster rate. Research on the links between these tw o conditions can have an important impact on our view of biodiversity, the services provided by natural ecosystems, and how we manage them. In co-sponsorship with Yale University's Center for EcoEpid emiology, the Smithsonian Institution, and the World Conservation Union, EPA's NCER convened an interdis ciplinary forum of researchers, practitioners, and decisionmakers in ecology, public health, remote sensing, an d the social sciences. The forum was an outreach effort to scientists, decisionmakers, and the public to increase awareness of the connections between biodiversity change and human health. NCER plans to support research to characterize the relationship between biodiversity change and human health and encourage interd isciplinary collaborations, within the United States and internationally, to address these issues. The public forum consisted of presentations on various topi cs related to biodiversity and human health, including research on biodiversity decline and increased incidence o f infectious diseases, the role of social capital in managing environmental resources, soil biodiversity and human health, protecting biodiversity for potential medicinal value, wildlife trade and risks to biodiver sity, valuation of biodiversity related to disease, and potential applications for observing systems to monito r and predict risks to the environment and health. Through a variety of perspectives and disciplines, the forum i dentified the need for further research to better characterize scientific mechanisms and the anthropogenic stressors th at affect them, as well as encouraged interdisciplinary collaboration to address these issues. Changes in Host Biodiversity and Incidence of Infectious D isease Empirically based models predict that the loss of host-species diversity results in a greater proportion of ticks infected with the Lyme disease pathogen. This dilution ef fect predicts lower rates of infection for a particular pathogen in highly diverse communities, where less co mpetent hosts dilute transmission rates. Predator species richness and forest fragmentation were found to be related to the density of infected vectors. Although there is evidence of a dilution effect for other patho gens, such as West Nile virus, it is possible that increasing diversity of competent hosts can provide opportuni ties for increases in disease transmission. Vector feeding behaviors need to be explored under different condition s of host diversity and density. The regulation of vectors in nature remains an important area of research. Habitat Alteration and Disease Transmission An interdisciplinary study on disease transmission among p eople and primates in Uganda, where forest fragmentation has reduced the biodiversity of plants, vertebrates , and invertebrates, showed an association between forest clearing and the development of gastrointestinal pr oblems in people living nearby. Higher levels of microbes were also found in these disturbed sites, along with increased interspecific disease transmission among primates including people. A working model was developed describing the roles of socioeconomic, cultural, and environmental factors on disease emergen ce. In Peru, deforestation has been associated with increased malaria transmission. Human biting rates of Anopheles darlingi, the most efficient vector of malaria in the Peruvian Amazon, were significantly hig her in deforested sites compared to sites with less habitat alteration, independent of population density. L and-use changes can also disrupt the critical roles that soil microbes play as biological control agents, parasi tes, and predators to moderate outbreaks of disease in water, food, plants, humans, and other animals. Biodiversity and Human Health: A Multidisciplinary Approach To Examining the Links The Office of Research and Development's National C enter for Environmental Research 3 Social Science Perspectives on Biodiversity and Health A study of risk posed by coastal hazards among villages in Thailand, where mangrove forest fragmentation has degraded the disaster mitigation function of these ecosystems, indicated a relationship between community-based social capital and success in reforestation ef forts. Higher levels of social capital indicate greater capacity to take collective action for enhancing coastal ecosystems that leads to reducing risk to human communities. A conceptual model was developed explaining the influences of social capital and humanitarian aid delivery systems on community performance in eco system restoration. In Brazil, researchers studied biodiversity valuation in the context of disease regu lation. Econometric models of the effects of climate change and deforestation on malaria showed that gross domes tic product, investments, and imports decrease with current climate change trends and increase with forest con servation. Applications of Research for Risk Monitoring and Prediction A European research program, Emerging Diseases in a Changing E uropean Environment (EDEN), was developed to identify, evaluate, and catalog ecosystems and enviro nmental conditions linked to global change that affect infectious disease transmission over space and time. T his cooperative effort integrates research on disease systems that are linked by key activities such as disease modeling, environmental change detection, and biodiversity monitoring with the goal of developing ear ly warning systems. A similar effort is underway to develop a comprehensive and coordinated system of observing sy stems at the global level to monitor and predict risks to health and the environment. GEOSS is organi zed under nine Societal Benefit Areas, including conserving biodiversity and understanding the environmental f actors that affect human health and well-being. Models have been produced to predict the effects of climate on ch olera and reduce disease burden in Bangladeshi villages.

Biodiversity and Human Health: A Multidisciplinary Approach To Examining the Links The Office of Research and Development's National C enter for Environmental Research 4 Biodiversity and Human Health: A Multidisciplinary Approach To Examining the Links September 14, 2006 Meeting Summary OVERVIEW The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Biodiversity and Human Health: A Multidisciplinary Approach To Examining the Links meeting was held September 14, 2006, in Washington, DC. Co-sponsored by EPA's National Center for Environmental Research (NCER)\u2014par t of EPA's Office of Research and Development (ORD)\u2014and Yale University's Center for EcoEpidemio logy, the Smithsonian Institution, and the World Conservation Union, the forum explored issues rel ated to changes in biodiversity and risks to human health. Experts from a range of disciplines from academia, nongo vernmental organizations (NGOs), and management agencies from the United States and abroad participated, p resenting on various themes such as epidemiology and vector ecology; wildlife trade; and the valuati on of biodiversity for public health. Approximately 175 individuals attended the meeting, while ot hers in and outside of the United States tuned into the live Webcast. A list of participants is included in the Appendices. Introduction Gary Foley, EPA/ORD/NCER Dr. Gary Foley welcomed the participants and introduced hims elf as the Director of NCER. He was glad to have the opportunity to be involved with this forum, one that he hopes will present positive challenges for the participants. He then introduced the first speaker Dr. Will iam Farland, the Acting Deputy Assistant Administrator for Science at EPA/ORD. Speaking after Dr. Farl and was Dr. Conrad Lautenbacher, Jr., the Under Secretary of Commerce for Oceans and Atmosphere and the Admi nistrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Welcome and Opening Remarks William Farland, EPA/ORD Dr. Farland began by thanking the meeting sponsors\u2014the Yale C enter for EcoEpidemiology, the Smithsonian, and the World Conservation Union\u2014for helpin g EPA orchestrate the meeting. He described the event as a unique opportunity to bring ecological health and h uman health together. This interdisciplinary approach is the objective of a research program proposed by NCER to examine the links between changes in biodiversity and risks to human health. Taking an interdis ciplinary approach, the forum provides the opportunity to share different perspectives on themes related to biodiversity and human health. EPA's research program is focused on determining how anthropogenic drivers of changes in biodiversity directly affect the transmission of human disease and the underlying mechanisms th at connect these issues. Although the idea that biodiversity change and human health mig ht be connected directly is not a new one, it is a topic that needs to be explored further. It is know n that biodiversity loss is accelerating. There is a decline occurring in wild populations of vertebrates in terres trial and aquatic environments. At the same time, there is an emergence or reemergence of infectious diseases. Examinin g the root causes of disease emergence and spread will assist in prevention and mitigation strategi es. This research should be undertaken with the understanding that environmental factors contribute to the dis eases and that environmental stewardship may reduce their burden. Also critical is the exploration of the u nderlying relationship between biodiversity and human health and the development of new tools and approaches. Thi s research has unique characteristics, including its focus on systems where biodiversity change is hypothesized to be an important driver of risks to human health, and its attempt to link Earth observation data t o societal benefits related to human health and Biodiversity and Human Health: A Multidisciplinary Approach To Examining the Links The Office of Research and Development's National C enter for Environmental Research 5 biodiversity conservation. EPA believes the research is timely and will place the Agency at the forefront of a new field focusing on biodiversity's role in human health an d well-being. Key expected outcomes include an increased awareness of the connections between biodiversity and human health; support for research to characterize the relationship between biodiversity change and human heal th; and new momentum for interdisciplinary collaborations, within the United States and with international partners. Dr. Farland concluded by recognizing two key international collaborators who spoke later in the day: Dr. St\u00e9phane de La Rocque, Project Coordinator for a new project of the European C ommission called Emerging Diseases in a Changing European Environment (EDEN); and Dr. Jos\u00e9 Achache, Director of the Group on Earth Observations (GEO) Secretariat. Dr. Farland added that he was loo king forward to dialogue with EPA's international partners, as well as with the forum participants , on the important scientific aspects of the research at hand. Taking the Pulse of the Planet: A Multi-Disciplinary App roach to Biodiversity and Public Health Conrad Lautenbacher, Jr., U.S. Navy (Ret.), National Oceani c and Atmospheric Administration Dr. Lautenbacher thanked Drs. Foley, Farland, and Pongsiri f or their efforts in organizing the event and thanked the participants for their attendance. He began with an anal ogy, mentioning that, on a rainy day in Washington, one can almost see the mold growing beneath one's f eet when walking, and it conjures up the image of the area as being a swamp prior to development, with mo squitoes in the vicinity. Although rain is connected to human health and well-being and the planet, it is com monplace and humans do not deal with it on a global level to make any global connections. The foundation of science is observation, and better health policies are needed that are connected to general science. Large-scale obser vations are required to permit discussions of global level problems. It also is important to work on issues in a connected system because human health is directly dependent on the health of the planet. A n example of linking biodiversity and health occurs with coral reefs, upon which millions of people depend for their livelihood. Reefs are an important pharmaceutical source, holding the promise to cure various diseases , such as cancer, HIV/AIDS, and arthritis. It is established that coral reefs are stressed by high water temp eratures and light levels, resulting in coral bleaching. Studies are underway and new management tools are being developed to measure and forecast threats to coral reef ecosystems. Integrated environmental understanding of biodiversity and h uman health also has facilitated prediction of disease outbreaks. For example, it is known that the incidence of malaria and other vector-borne diseases can change dramatically during extreme weather events related to El Ni\u00f1o . The monitoring of physical, chemical, and biological parameters, and integration of this information into a comprehensive data management system, is the premise for GEOSS, the Global Earth Observation Sys tem of Systems. GEOSS involves 65 countries and 43 organizations and has four operating principles to ensu re that the system is useful globally. A new GEOSS product in development, GEO-NETCast, will serve as a r eal-time global data system that will use satellite technology to bring information to the global pu blic health community and many other communities in a user-friendly form. A rudimentary version of the syst em will be operational in about 1 year and will include biological and medical information that, to date, has n ot been connected well with environmental information. Integrating the various data sources will facilit ate prediction, decisionmaking, response and, ultimately, bring public health benefits. Dr. Lautenbacher conclu ded by expressing his gratitude for the opportunity to deliver his message and added that Dr. Achache is present and can answer any questions on GEO after his presentation later in the day. RESEARCH PRESENTATIONS Dr. Foley introduced Dr. Montira Pongsiri as the moderato r for the remainder of the meeting. He commended her efforts as one of the EPA staff members who org anized the meeting. Dr. Pongsiri works with Dr. Joe Roman on biodiversity and health at NCER. Dr. Pongsiri thanked all of the participants and stated that i t was a privilege to have Drs. Farland and Lautenbacher open the meeting. Each research presentation in this por tion of the forum was followed by a discussion session. A Webcast also was held and recorded; it is archived on the Yale Center for Biodiversity and Human Health: A Multidisciplinary Approach To Examining the Links The Office of Research and Development's National C enter for Environmental Research 6 EcoEpidemiology Web Site at http://www.yale.edu/yibs/biodiversity.html . The Forum presentations also will be accessible from the new EPA Portal on Biodiversity and Health , which was launched on September 13. The URL is http://www.epa.gov/ncer/biodiversity . The Web site will be updated regularly and is intended to s erve as a resource for scientific information on biodiversity and health, as well as for learning information on related EPA efforts, activities with partners, and upcoming events. BIODIVERSITY DECLINE AND RISKS TO HUMAN HEALTH Biodiversity and the Dilution Effect: The Case of Lyme Dis ease Richard Ostfeld, Institute of Ecosystem Studies Considered one of the emerging infectious diseases alongside such diseases as HIV/AIDS, avian influenza, and SARS, Lyme disease (LD) is a zoonosis occurring primarily in three loci across the United States\u2014the West Coast, upper Midwest, and the Eastern seaboard\u2014with rough ly 20,000 cases reported per year. LD is caused by the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi and transmitted by the nymphal stage of the tick Ixodes scapularis to vertebrate hosts that act as reservoirs of the pathogen, which is later transmitted to humans. A common, highly permissive, and abundant host for B. burgdorferi is the white-footed mouse, Peromyscus leucopus . This study examined a proposed model for the effects of ver tebrate density on the infection prevalence of LD known as the \"dilution effect\" model. The model p roposes that high host diversity presents the tick population with many opportunities to feed on hos ts that are very inefficient in transmitting the LD bacterium. These communities also have greater control on the abund ance of white-footed mice via predation and competition. By increasing the number of non-mouse host s, the ticks take fewer mice meals, thereby reducing tick infestation of mice. These effects of high vertebrat e density represent a \"dilution effect\" of LD on mice. Data were obtained via trapping and netting various m ammal and bird hosts, with translocation to the laboratory to determine tick burdens and reservoir competence. The model predicted that, in an intact forest community, about 45 percent of the ticks will be infected; t he empirical value was within 1 percent of that prediction. Simulation then was used to dissemble the commun ity, and remove species, in approximately the order in which they are lost by habitat fragmentation. It was shown that increasing loss of host species results in a greater proportion of infected ticks, with the highest p roportion (92.1%) for a mice-only community. Whether the density of infected nymphs is influenced by increas ing host diversity was examined via 40 trapping sites across three different Northeastern areas. The stu dy found a significant negative correlation between predator species richness and white-footed mouse populati on density. The study also found that the strongest factor reducing tick burdens on the mice is the incr easing abundance of chipmunks, with an average larval burden per mouse decreased by 20 larval ticks as the number of chipmunks increases from 0 to 80. In examining forest fragmentation and LD risk, the research f ound that larger forest fragments consistently have more numbers of host species. Smaller forest fragments wou ld experience a loss of vertebrate diversity, leading to poor regulation of the white-footed mice populati ons. This in turn would lead to increased infection prevalence and high tick density, together increasing LD risk. T his model was tested in 14 more forest fragments in Dutchess County, New York, and researchers found a significant negative correlation between fragment size and nymph density, as well as a significant decli ne in both nymph infection prevalence and density of infected nymphs. On average, small forest fragments had about four to five times higher density of infected nymphs than did larger forest fragments. It is prop osed that the dilution effect might be operating by four distinct mechanisms: reducing the abundance of the reservo ir; diverting vector meals to less-competent hosts; reducing vector abundance; and reducing the rate of trans mission of the pathogen. The next step is to determine whether the dilution effect might apply to other dis ease systems. Discussion Dr. Mustafa Aral asked whether any information has been generated o n the effect of the ticks on the lifespan of the host over time or vice versa. Dr. Ostfeld resp onded that this question has received little attention to date and it is an important one to address to understand the dynamics of LD. Only a few pathologies have been found in relation to the impact of the Borrelia infection on hosts, with no evidence that lifespan is reduced and no clinical signs have been found in wildlife hosts . These few observations have been found in Biodiversity and Human Health: A Multidisciplinary Approach To Examining the Links The Office of Research and Development's National C enter for Environmental Research 7 domestic hosts, such as dogs and horses, and there has been no known impact on humans. Dr. Ostfeld added the findings have almost certainly had some, if minor, impacts on fitness. The finite instrumentation required to detect the impact of Borrelia infection on host populations also likely explains the pauci ty of information. A participant asked whether there are counties or communities els ewhere in the world that have used research findings on LD in conjunction with land use plannin g. Dr. Ostfeld replied that one problem with applying the information is translating it into policy. For instance, the sampling needs to be increased to include more counties and more areas, to increase the confidence of t he results. He explained that there is a bit of a disconnect between the notion that fragment size or fragment ation itself has an impact on LD risk and what kind of zoning or other regulations would be implemen ted. Although it is tempting to assume that the larger the lot, the larger the forest being conserved, this is not necessarily the case. For instance, cluster housing would include very small individual lots but also have a larger tract of forest preserved for communal use. Dr. Anand Ramanathan asked whether there is a comparison between ento mological risk measures and incidence of LD in the human population. Dr. Ostfeld respon ded that this has not been attempted until fairly recently. He mentioned that certain researchers, including Dr. Durl and Fish's group, have addressed this question, but the results have been confounding. For instance, in the area around Connecticut, habitat fragmentation was associated with higher density and infection prevalence in ticks. At the state level, however, fragmentation was associated with lower incidence in human populat ions. The next step, Dr. Ostfeld explained, is to integrate the entomological risks with human components of risk. Thus, a relationship can be determined from observations of people who live in highly f ragmented landscapes or those who do not venture into the woods. Good public health outcomes will rely on i ntegrating entomological risk with human knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors with respect to LD. Avian Diversity and West Nile Virus Risk Vanessa Ezenwa, University of Montana West Nile virus (WNV) is a vector-borne zoonotic infectious d isease that has only recently emerged in the United States. Transmitted by mosquitoes, WNV can infect in cidental hosts, including horses, reptiles, and humans, in addition to wild birds, which are the main reser voir host for the virus. WNV was first detected in the summer of 1999 in New York City, New York, and has s ince spread from the East Coast to the West Coast over a 5-year period. WNV distributi on depends on having suitable host, environmental, and vector traits, including density, diversit y, and physiology; climate and habitat; and density, diversity, and behavior, respectively. This study examined wh ether patterns of WNV infection in mosquitoes are explained by differences in avian diversity and whether this d iversity can influence human WNV disease risk. A field study was undertaken to address the first ques tion and involved weekly mosquito collection and analysis for WNV and infection rate, from a series of six sit es in St. Tammany Parish, Louisiana. Bird species richness and abundance were estimated using avian counts. The st udy predicted that higher non-passerine species richness is associated with lower mosquito infection rates and that higher passerine species richness is associated with higher mosquito infection rates. The results s upported the first prediction, demonstrating that non-passerine species appear to be functioning as dilution host s for WNV, possibly by decreasing contact rates between suitable WNV hosts and vectors. To test the relationshi p between avian diversity and human disease incidence, a comparative study was undertaken Louisiana-wide, inclu ding human cases reported yearly since 2002, with 41 counties with cases in 2002 and 33 counties with cases in 2003. Four predictor variables were examined: passerine species richness, non-passerine species richness , human density, and county area. This study found that non-passerine species richness was significant ly negatively correlated with both mosquito infection rates and human disease incidence. In contrast, passerine species richness was not correlated with either human or mosquito infections. These findings suggest that bird diversity may play a critical role in moderating human WNV disease risk. Further work will examine the mechanisms underlying the observed patterns. Biodiversity and Human Health: A Multidisciplinary Approach To Examining the Links The Office of Research and Development's National C enter for Environmental Research 8 Discussion Dr. David Blockstein asked whether future studies will examine the role of landscape types and try to parse that out, given that nonforested habitats tend to have a h igher proportion of non-passerines relative to forested habitats. Dr. Ezenwa replied that the study has found an interesting wetland effect, likely because the team is working primarily in a wetland area and, therefore, a larg e proportion of the sites tended to be wetlands. The results showed that wetlands had a strong negativ e association with WNV prevalence. The group tried to parse this result out to determine how wetlan d area was influencing mosquito infection rates. Several factors were assessed, including how wetland area influences t he density of mosquitoes, how it influences the abundance of different host species, and how it in fluences the relative composition of host species. The research revealed that wetland area influences the compositio n of bird species, which strongly influences vector infection. The team believes, therefore, that habit at would display a strong role by influencing the relative interactions between different host species in the habitat. Dr. Sarah Randolph commented that she is a little concerned ab out the slightly crude measure of host diversity and bird diversity, especially given the low heterog eneity in the contact between vectors and their hosts. She asked whether or not the team has taken account of the type of results that have emerged from past research on the disproportionate feeding by mosquitoes on certai n host species that are apparently rather less common in the habitat. Dr. Randolph suggested that it would be beneficial to focus on other, more specific traits, rather than just species abundance, to produce more accurate results. Dr. Ezenwa agreed that there is enormous heterogeneity in the way in which different vectors f eed on the host species and that finer scale analyses are needed. She added that her study was a preliminary anal ysis to determine whether any pattern could be found, to document effects observed, and to examine in more detail how characteristics such as bird diversity and density affect differences in vector feeding behavior , and how that relates to vector infection patterns. Dr. Ezenwa noted that with a system such as WNV, whi ch involves multiple hosts and multiple vectors simultaneously, teasing apart effects is challenging. Dr. Gregory Glass asked whether the team has conducted blood m eal analysis on the mosquitoes. Dr. Ezenwa responded that her team has not done any work so far on mosquito blood meal analysis, but there are plans to do so in the future. Dr. Aral asked whether the impact of the climate effect for 2002/2 003 on the results was examined. Dr. Ezenwa responded that, because the study encompassed only 2 years, and the sample size was insufficient, it was difficult to assess the influence of climate change. In additi on, the subsequent years have had less WNV incidence in Louisiana, so climate level analysis would again be difficult with insufficient data. She added that her team looks forward to analyzing the effect of climate change wit h a larger sample size. Dr. Pongsiri asked whether mosquitoes appear to have a preferen ce for non-passerine species or whether the results are more attributable to host availability/abundance. Dr. Ezenwa responded that the results presented were based on the assumption that vectors feed on hosts in the proportions in which they occur in the habitat. This, she added, is probably not the case. Research on vector feeding preferences must be combined with work on species abundance and diversity to better underst and the broad patterns that have emerged. DISEASE EMERGENCE IN TERRESTRIAL AND MARINE ENVIRONMENTS Disease Emergence in Terrestrial and Marine Environments Rita Colwell, University of Maryland Drawing insight from many contexts, the study of infectio us disease in the 21st century must be viewed from a global perspective and with an improved understanding of epidemiology. The global scale of research in this century is unprecedented; it is multi- and interdisci plinary, and scientific questions cross national borders. Diseases of epidemic scale include cholera, caused by the bacter ium Vibrio cholerae . The bacterium is associated with a copepod, and the sequence of zooplankton blo oms following phytoplankton blooms has permitted the use of remote sensing to understand the relatio nship between sea surface temperature and cholera Biodiversity and Human Health: A Multidisciplinary Approach To Examining the Links The Office of Research and Development's National C enter for Environmental Research 9 epidemics. Seasonality is a characteristic of almost every infectiou s disease, and every infectious disease has an environmental origin. The El Ni\u00f1o is a predictor of chol era. Research for the last 8 years in Bangladesh has involved data collection on environmental parameters, including pH, temperature, salinity, chlorophyll, and plankton populations and, in combination with clinical and remote sensing data, has made possible the prediction of the geographic location and intensity of cholera ep idemics. In August 2004, a study tested whether cholera rates could be predicted from the previous months ; the researchers predicted 24 cases per 1,000 people, and the actual number was 25.8. Other work in Bangladesh has focused on the application value of knowledge on the environmental cycle of cholera, to help hum ans directly. Researchers have found that removal of the plankton from the waters could reduce the level o f cholera in the villages. A 3-year study was undertaken to examine the efficacy of sari cloth filtration in reducing the number of cholera cases. It was found that if a sari cloth was folded five or six times, it coul d reduce the incidence of cholera by 50 percent. Old cloths are better sieves than newer cloths because the former have mo re fraying and therefore greater surface area for capturing the microbes. An ongoing study is now bei ng completed. A survey of the villagers in Bangladesh 3 years later found that 60 to 70 percent of the peop le were employing sari cloth filtration of their water. The hope is to introduce the technique to Africa, where civ il unrest has resulted in a breakdown of human cleansing systems and where cholera is especially prevalent. Discussion Dr. Linda Stathoplos asked whether the cholera prediction model currently is operatio nal, and if not, what would be needed to implement the model. Dr. Colwell responded that the model can be applied to other diseases and her group is working on these applications. She em phasized that a very important next step will be to feed biological data into the climate models. Dr. Stathopl os then asked whether the predictions will be posted on the Web. Dr. Colwell responded that her group wil l work with the University of Maryland and other colleagues. Emergence of Tick-Borne Pathogens in the Northeast United Sta tes Durland Fish, Yale University The prevalence of tick-borne pathogens has been increasing in th e Northeastern United States over the past several decades. In this region, seven tick-borne pathogens are fou nd that are capable of infecting humans with such diseases as LD, human anaplasmosis, babesiosis, and tick-bo rne typhus. Several key characteristics of ticks make them excellent vectors of disease agents: zoophilic feedi ng behavior, prolonged host contact, feeding for up to 7 days; pharmacologic saliva; and high path ogen prevalence. It was the changing of landscape from open farmland to a forested environment, along w ith the introduction of deer, that resulted in the emergence of LD in the 1970s in the Northeast United States , which now is quite strongly infected by I. scapularis . A study in Westchester County, New York, in 1990 found a human-biting rate of 20.4 ticks per 100 persons per year. Extrapolating this figure over 10 states wi th the highest LD incidence gives approximately 5 million tick bites per year. First diagnosed in 1987, human anaplasmosis is caused by a bacterium that is transmitted by I. scapularis . The microbe has several reservoir species, including raccoons, sq uirrels, and birds. Another disease, babesiosis, also has I. scapularis as the vector, but has just the white-footed mouse as its reservoir species. This disease was discovered in 1970, and it has since then spread from east to west across Connecticut. Powassan virus is transmitted by another species o f tick, I. cookei , and its reservoir species is mustelids. The virus also has been shown to be transmittabl e by I. scapularis . The first case of human infection for this virus was diagnosed in 1958 in Ontario, Canada. Another example of a mammal reservoir of disease is the fisher, which became extinct in 1900 in the mid-Atlantic St ates. With positive reintroductions in Pennsylvania and West Virginia, the animal now has reached pest s tatus in Connecticut. The fisher is a possible reservoir for moving the powassan virus. In the cas e of B. burgdorferi and I. scapularis -borne pathogens, there is evidence of a dilution effect. The addition o f other hosts, however, provides the opportunity for a pollution effect because of the trading of a reduction in LD for an increase in other tick-borne diseases. It has been shown that multiple pathogens can occur on ticks, w hich complicate the diagnosis of disease. Caution must be exercised when interpreting relationships between tick-b orne paths and biodiversity, in terms of the recommendations or policy concerning public health and biodiver sity relationships. Biodiversity and Human Health: A Multidisciplinary Approach To Examining the Links The Office of Research and Development's National C enter for Environmental Research 10 Discussion Dr. A. Marm Kilpatrick asked whether the various diseases caused by environmental tick diseases rise to the same level of incidence as LD. Dr. Fish responded that babesi osis and anaplasmosis were introduced into the same region as LD, and that there is potential for spread o f powassan virus. He added that environmental change in the Northeast\u2014such as reforestation and succession\u2014might be resulting in a reduction in the cases in risk groups, because there are more woods and more edge. Dr. Geoff Patton asked about the predators of ticks. Dr. F ish responded that the main source of predation is hosts. He added that a paper published in The Auk in the late 1980s claimed that guinea colonies ate ticks. Part of the problem is that only a handful of studies have assessed the biological control of tick populations. It is important, Dr. Fish emphasized, to understand how tick pop ulations are regulated. Dr. Roman asked about the result of adding high-level predat ors, such as the introduction of wolves into Yellowstone National Park, on transmission of disease. Dr. F ish responded that, in the case of deer, once the tick populations are established, the deer must be removed befor e the tick population will crash. NATURAL HAZARDS AND COASTAL BIODIVERSITY The Role of Coastal Ecosystem Degradation in Tsunami Dama ge Phil Berke, University of North Carolina A study was conducted to examine the extent of ecosystem damage on the Andaman coast of Thailand following the tsunami of 2004. The research focused on Ranon g province, because it is one of the world's great coastal ecosystems and it sustained rather severe impacts fro m the tsunami. To examine the relationship between coastal ecosystem degradation and the vulnerability of the coastal communities, various sites of damage were assessed at comparable heights and distances from the open coast, using remote sensing analysis as well as field work to collect data. The study also had a soci al science phase that examined community performance in mangrove forest conservation and the influence of s ocial capital on performance. Throughout the world, mangroves are being lost to urban development and aquaculture. Six villages were chosen based on various criteria, such as sustained damage and presence of mangrov es, and key local leaders were interviewed in those locations. Preliminary findings revealed wide variati on in the adoption and implementation of mangrove conservation practices, ranging from clear rules and st andards for tree cutting, replanting programs, parasite removal, inspection, and monitoring systems in place. In villages where the performance in conservation was high, there was a high level of social capital, with well-established norms in place oriented around the fishing way of life. In these villages, the social capital was activated when external organizations took a bottom-up approach in communication with local people. In contrast, performance in conservation dropped during top-down aid delivery, when external organizat ions denied grassroots-level networks to respond to local conservation needs; in such cases, houses were des igned and built by external authorities. Preliminary conclusions include the need to develop cross-domai n models founded on science-based relationships, develop more rigorous models of causes and im pacts of social capital, and initiate community demonstration projects for ecosystem management and public health . These projects can aim to strengthen networks; develop leadership capacity; create frameworks to challeng e assumptions and motivate action; provide technical resources; and create clearinghouses for networks an d contacts. Discussion A participant noted that social communities, when more complex, appear to be more resilient, which is an attribute of biological communities of increasing complexity. Is this a reasonable observation? Dr. Berke agreed with that statement. The number of networks and their d iversity will influence the strength of bonding within communities. Biodiversity and Human Health: A Multidisciplinary Approach To Examining the Links The Office of Research and Development's National C enter for Environmental Research 11 SOILS , BIODIVERSITY , AND LINKS TO HUMAN HEALTH Soils, Biodiversity, and Links to Human Health Diana Wall, Colorado State University Soil organisms play a central role as causal agents of human d isease on a global scale. In 2002, for instance, the World Health Organization estimated a total of more than 6 million deaths from soil-borne pathogens. Categories of soil-borne diseases include viruses, b acteria, protozoa, fungi, and helminthes. For fungi alone, more than 300 out of approximately 100,000 species cause disease. The soil habitat of fauna and flora is shaped by various factors, including geology, climat e, and vegetation type. Also variable is the biodiversity present within soils: one gram contains bill ions of bacteria, down to the hundreds of nematodes. Among nematodes, only about 15 percent are animal or human parasi tes. In some cases, groups are endemic only to soils, such as the Chilopoda. Most soil species ar e involved in decomposition processes and, when disturbed, these species can go into a parasitic or pathogen phas e. These species also have other jobs, such as providing ecosystem services, including the provision of essential nutrients for biota; decay, detoxification, and purification of water; and prevention of soil erosion and contribution to sediment stability. In some cultures, soil microbes serve as a food source. The most critical role of soil microbes, however, is serving as biological control agents, parasites, pathogens, and predators of other organisms in soil to moderate disease outbreak in water, food, plants, humans, and other animals. An example of soil disturbance is occurring in sub- Saharan Africa, where fields are continually farmed and the scavenging of vegetation and dung deplete soil nutrients. Land degradation results in increased dispersal of microbes and invertebrates. Thus, the soil food web structure becomes disrupted as predators and parasites are rem oved. This habitat change decreases soil animal diversity. These various soil-borne pathogens can be class ified into four types: permanent, periodic, transient, and incidental. An example of a permanent resident-caused disease, cocciodiomycosis, is caused by the inhalation of airborne fungal spores. As with other micr obes, soil disturbance increases distribution of the disease agent, Coccidioides immitis . Long-term climate fluctuations, such as wind erosion, can af fect the growth and distribution of soil-borne pathogens, produc ing escalating effects on human health in the future. The long-term climate fluctuations that affect growth and dist ribution of soil-borne pathogens will increasingly affect human health in the future. A systems approach will be n eeded to understand the relationships between soil, biodiversity, and incidence of human disease. Discussion Dr. Pongsiri asked whether anything is known about the g enetic diversity of the soil-borne pathogens. Dr. Wall responded that more is known about the genetic diversit y of pathogens of economic crops on which humans rely for food, than is known about the soil-borne pathogens of humans. ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE AND DISEASE RISK Biodiversity Loss and the Ecology of Infectious Disease Tra nsmission Among People, Primates, and Domestic Animals in Kibale National Park, Uganda Tony Goldberg, University of Illinois A disproportionate number of many human emerging infectious diseases (EIDs), such as HIV/AIDS, yellow fever, and Ebola, come from nonhuman primates. Contr ibuting to this emergence is the fact that humans and nonhumans share habitats and have similar physiolog ies. Anthropogenic disturbance is altering primate habitats radically. The Kibale EcoHealth Project was initia ted 3 years ago to determine how disturbance affects rates and patterns of disease transmission betw een primates and people; to understand how biodiversity loss affects those rates and patterns and reduces human health; and to improve human health and primate conservation. The study area was located in Kibale National Park, Uganda, an area of high primate biodiversity. The forest in Kibale is fragmented but contains areas of undisturbed, pristine rainforest vegetation. Outside the forest lie remnant forest fragments t hat are home to primates and that are used by humans. This forest fragmentation has been shown to reduce th e biodiversity of plants, vertebrates, and invertebrates in the forest. For instance, 12 primate species liv e within the protected areas of the park; Biodiversity and Human Health: A Multidisciplinary Approach To Examining the Links The Office of Research and Development's National C enter for Environmental Research 12 however, only 3 species are found outside the park property. T he study involved the collection of observational data on the primates; health and survey information from peop le living around the impacted areas; landscape data that characterize land use habitat and changes over time in the land scape; and pathogen data, including molecular techniques, to infer transmission. A human health su rvey conducted in 2004-2006 included 477 people and revealed an association between clearing forests and the devel opment of gastrointestinal (GI) problems. The land use data involved multiple scales, using r emote sensing and ground survey data. For the pathogen data, the GI pathogens were transmitted via fecal-oral, environment, and waterborne routes. The research has revealed significantly higher levels of microbes in fo rest fragments versus in undisturbed or livestock areas. The study also found significant interspecifi c disease transmission involving the exchange of bacteria between chimpanzees and people employed in chimpanzee research and to urism, relative to people from local villages. In addition, a significant proportion of people (80%) was found to have antibiotic resistance to Escherichia coli in three Kibale forest fragments, even though these people hav e very restricted access to health care. There is evidence of movement of this resistan ce from people to domestic animals and primates in the fragments and undisturbed fragments. Specificall y, the study has identified three integrons that move between human and animal bacteria in a Kibale forest fragment. A working model has been developed that takes into account key factors that lead to disease emergence and r eductions in health, including the socioeconomic and cultural factors that resulted in the initial f orest fragmentation. Discussion Dr. Roman asked whether there are any comparable studies ongoing , specifically in South America or Central America. Dr. Goldberg responded that people are aware that there are primates in South and Central America and are interested in the transmission of infectious dis ease to people and primates. He added that there has been a history of study regarding yellow fever between people and primates in Central America. To Dr. Goldberg's knowledge, however, there are no other studies that incorporate longitudinal data on human health, primate behavior, changes in the landscapes, and changes i n the demographics of those species. Dr. Pongsiri asked whether the study has examined the effects of habitat perturbation such as fragmentation and its associated stresses (e.g., loss of food source) on the loss of immunity in primates. Dr. Goldberg responded that there are no direct measures of immunity , but that his collaborator at McGill University in Montreal, Dr. Tom Chapman, has been studying fecal cortisol levels as a rough index of stress. This work has found that cortisol levels do seem to respo nd to habitat disturbance, with higher cortisol levels found in primates living in edge habitat fragments than in t hose living elsewhere. A confounding factor is nutrition, however, because the nutritional resources of the ani mals are much lower in the fragments than in the main forest. Thus, it is unclear whether the direct effects are nu trition-related or due to other stresses. It is important to note that the human populations living around the fragments are highly immunocompromised by a high prevalence of HIV/AIDS. The presence of the immunocomprom ised people living in close proximity to the stressed nonhuman primates, exchanging pathogens with them , creates a hotspot for emerging infectious disease. Dr. Judy Oglethorpe pointed out that, in addition to i mpacts of environmental change on human health, human health can have impacts on the environment. For instance, th e local impacts of HIV/AIDS in Africa change the dynamics of resource use. When the main breadwinner is lost, more hunting and fishing and other sustained exploitation of natural resources occurs to provide s ustenance for families. Dr. Goldberg responded that this is exactly what is seen in his team's study area. He explained that the relationship between biodiversity and human health is a two-way street. Many changes that are seen in the use of a region seem to go along with interactive changes that might qualify infections such as HIV and malaria. Therefore, it is very likely that habitat diversity can function to affect human health and human health can function to affect biodiversity. Dr. Subhrendu Pattanayak inquired whether people were asked in t he household survey if they recognized that the changes they are making to the landscape have health consequences for them and may increase transmission of disease. Dr. Goldberg explained that these are extremely impoverished communities, most with extremely low degrees of education. These people are not very aware of the linkages between land use Biodiversity and Human Health: A Multidisciplinary Approach To Examining the Links The Office of Research and Development's National C enter for Environmental Research 13 change and disease. He added that the Kibale project has excellent relatio ns with the local and regional government and NGOs in Uganda, and is building on more than 30 years of research on primate ecology and biodiversity. Once the team can identify the risk factors that l ead to the reduction of human health as a result of biodiversity loss, this will be a prime position in wh ich to affect change. Environmental Change and Disease Risk Gregory Glass, Johns Hopkins University Research was conducted to assess the effect of deforestation on hum an-biting rate by a particular vector of malaria, Anopheles darlingi , in the Amazonian region of Peru. The study area is located on the Amazon River in Iquitos, a relatively isolated port city on the Amazon. A global elimination of malaria was begun toward the end of World War II and into the 1950s and 1960s. Over t ime, various malaria surveys were undertaken, and by 1991, A. darlingi was no longer detected. In the early 1990s, the human populat ion in Iquitos began to increase and associated with this was habitat change and subsequent i ncidence of malaria. By 1997, 54,000 malaria cases were reported. The present study used satellite imager y to identify land cover and classified the landscape into nine categories. Mosquitoes were collected from human s performing catches during a 6-hour period through the night. The data were linked with the land cover classification information to determine the locations in which A. darlingi was more likely to bite people. The results revealed that bites were more likely in regions of reduced forestation. The study area had about 14 different species of Anopheles . The highest abundance of Anopheles was in the ecotonal regions, where the land classes are much l ess distinct. A. darlingi is most abundant in areas that tend to be deforested. Increasing forest cover is related to a reduction in mosquito biting rate, whereas less forest cover is associated w ith a higher biting rate. Dr. Glass outlined various challenges that face biodiversity studies. For one, mos t biodiversity studies have not been rigorously designed to test theory. Also, many of the studies have failed to note whether methodology ever accounts for the observed patterns. Issues also abound in relation to stud y design. For example, the presence of humans is an effect modifier for examining the effect of biodiversity red uction on disease risk. In addition, it is important to understand what the surrogates of human disease risk measure. Another challenge is the existence of preconceptions regarding zooprophylaxis, which is the intentio nal increase in biodiversity by introducing other animals to produce a dilution effect and reduce the risk of human malaria. When vectors are anthropophylic, the strategy of bringing in other animals will not work b ecause these vectors prefer to feed on humans and, therefore, will increase human malaria risk. Zoophyllic vectors might have the potential to produce zooprophylaxis; however, introducing alternative hosts might actually increase the risk for transmission to humans, as some studies have shown. It is of interest to d etermine what disease systems are likely to lead to improved human health by preserving biodiversity. Discussion Dr. Fish commented that vector diversity may influence the r isk of malaria transmission, adding that it is possible that not all of the 14 Anopheles mosquitoes found in the Iquitos region will become pathog en vectors. Would increasing Anopheles diversity as opposed to dominance by the same species help to r educe the burden? Dr. Glass responded that this is a good point, a nd that one of the challenges of the study was that the resources were not available to determine how many of the species wer e infectious. Generally, the species mentioned are considered to be potentially efficient vectors of m alaria and there are certain species in this group that appear to be relatively inefficient hosts. Manipulati ng the community structure can help to identify ways to maximize the abundance of some of these less-efficient vecto rs. Regarding the quotation by Frederick Bang with which Dr. G lass opened his presentation (\"... we have gradually been forced to recognize that the various encephalitides ... cannot be eradicated unless we cover the surface of the country with cement.\"), Dr. Ostfeld commented th at the study discussed diversity as though a linear relationship exists between diversity and a health impact, such as risk of infectious disease. Paving the world will destroy the diversity and eradicate its associated d iseases. Dr. Ostfeld asked whether the shape of the curve that relates diversity to disease should be reconsider ed in order to increase the sophistication of the analysis. In many of the disease systems, there may be a thres hold level of diversity, he explained, often a low level, which is needed for a disease to exist in the first place. Beyond that threshold, however, increasing Biodiversity and Human Health: A Multidisciplinary Approach To Examining the Links The Office of Research and Development's National C enter for Environmental Research 14 diversity might reduce the burden of disease in some of the sy stems. Dr. Glass responded that he agrees that this is exactly the issue. Often, an understanding of the dyn amics of the systems is lacking. INTERNATIONAL PERSPECTIVE : RESEARCH ON ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE AND EMERGING HUMAN DISEASES Integrated Project, 6th PCRDT St\u00e9phane de La Rocque, Emerging Diseases in a Changing Europea n Environment Sarah Randolph, University of Oxford St\u00e9phane de La Rocque The EDEN project is an ongoing integrated project of the Euro pean Commission. The aim is to identify, evaluate, and catalog European ecosystems and environmental conditi ons linked to global change and that can influence the spatial and temporal distribution and the dynami cs of pathogenic agents. Involving 48 partners in 25 countries, the project has to take a coordinated European appr oach. The EDEN strategy is to focus on some key indicator diseases that have a strong link with the environ ment, are currently at risk of reemerging or emerging or spreading, and are representative of a wide geographical range and of epidemiological processes involved in emergence. The diseases include tick-borne diseases, r odent-borne diseases, leishmaniasis, WNV, and malaria. The sub-projects are linked together with various integrative activities that include disease modeling, low-resolution spatial modeling, environmental chan ge detection, biodiversity monitoring, and data management. The strategy will involve learning from the past, ex plaining the present, and predicting the future, through the development of disease monitoring and earl y warning systems. Sarah Randolph A case study on tick-borne diseases is seeking explanations of p ast patterns to predict the future. Of all the vector-borne pathogens in Europe, those transmitted by ticks ( I. ricinus ) are the most widespread. This offers a perfect case study of the diverse impact of humans, and direct and indirect (human-induced environmental change) impact on zoonotic risk. The focus is on tick-borne en cephalitis (TBE) virus because it has the best spatial and temporal records. It already is possible to explain and predict the distribution of TBE in Europe; now, the goal is to try to account for changing incidence. Th ere are some highly geographical patterns of change between countries in the recorded annual cases of TBE. For in stance, in Sweden, there was a stepwise increase in incidence in the early 1980s; in Western Europe, a m uch more gradual emergence of infection occurred. An analogy to account for the patterns observed is t hat zoonoses are like an iceberg\u2014their wildlife cycles are largely hidden beneath the surface. Also, their exposure varies in time and space, and the incidence in humans depends on two aspects: the bulk of the iceberg (tran smission potential) and the relative exposure (human contact rates). TBE is less widespread and prevalent than LD because it has a lower transmission potential (smaller bulk), but the same relative exposure to hu mans via the same ticks. Is this emergence of TBE due to the increase in the bulk, which could be thought of as biological factors, or is it due to increase in relative exposure, which can be considered human factors? To answer that question, data have been collected from 1970 to the present from national archives on disease i ncidence, environment, ticks, hosts, and humans. These data are being collected and analyzed to produce explanations a nd predictive models. New field work has begun to monitor tick stages at four to six sites per co untry across Europe to reveal tick population dynamics. Overall, it is obvious that the relationship betw een biodiversity and risk of zoonotic infection is complex and cannot be described with a simple generic model. More plausibly, the upsurge of TBE has been caused by biological (abiotic and biotic) and nonbiological facto rs acting independently but synergistically. For instance, there is evidence in the three Baltic states that ther e are independent but indirectly linked changes in relevant factors acting synergistically to increase TBE incidence. The extreme spatiotemporal heterogeneity in upsurge of TBE could be the result of a differential balan ce of each factor operating in each place. Biodiversity and Human Health: A Multidisciplinary Approach To Examining the Links The Office of Research and Development's National C enter for Environmental Research 15 BIODIVERSITY AND MEDICINES Mother Nature's Pharmacopoeia David Newman, National Cancer Institute Humans and animals have relied on plants as sources of medicatio n for thousands of years, starting with the use of the opium poppy\u2014the first \"drug substance\"\u2014more t han 4,500 years ago. Examples of other plant- derived drugs include analgesics, a cardiotonic, and drugs to tr eat malaria. Plant-derived products in cancer include Taxol, which revolutionized the treatment of breast cancer and is derived from the yew tree, and Vinca alkaloids, which revolutionized the treatment of childhood leuk emia. Two other plant-derived cancer products are camptothecin and podophyllotoxin. Of these four major dr ug compounds, three are derived from plants that have a fungal epiphyte. The dolastatins and its derivatives are d erived from a compound that has been isolated from the cyanophyte on which the sea hare Dolabella auricularia grazes. The drug Lipitor resulted from the discovery of a simple compound from a fungal permutation. A nother medicinal compound, a 25-amino acid peptide, has originated from the cone snail, is 50 times mor e active than morphine, has no addictive potential, and was approved in December 2004 for pain medication treatment. In the case of two songbird species (Pitohui dichrous and Ifrita kowaldi ), located approximately 2,000 kilometers apart from one another in New Guinea, diet controls whether or not they harbor toxic alkalo ids. These two birds contain the same toxic batrachotoxin alkaloids; the source of these compounds is beli eved to originate from a tiny melyrid beetle, upon which the birds feed. Insects also can harbor beneficial com pounds, such as the range of microbes in their gut flora that produce potential antibiotics and other bioactiv e agents. For instance, secretions from the termite Nasutitermes triodiae are antibacterial. Protecting against biodiversity loss will ensure that possibilities for future discoveries of important compounds and materials from microbes and their hosts also are protected. The \"Plants and People of Micronesia\" Project: Perspectives in Understanding the Relationship of Integrative Medicine, Traditional Knowledge and Biodiversity Roberta Lee, Continuum Center for Health and Healing Traditional medicine comprises the use of a wide range of modali ties and therapies used by traditional cultures for health care treatment such as ayurveda, acupuncture/Chin ese medicine, and Native American practices. In the United States, such practices tend to be characterized as alternative treatments. The prevalence of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) has increased over t ime. One study from 2004 found that 62 percent of 10,000 U.S. adults used CAM over a 12-mont h period. To address a significant gap in medical education, the first program in integrative medicine was found ed in 1997 at the University of Arizona School of Medicine for postdoctoral medicine faculty to begin to learn about the use of botanicals and the efficacy of compounds used in acupuncture and other alternative treatments. Th ere is now a national organization, the Consortium of Academic Health Centers for Integrative Medicine, which comprises 32 medical institutions, representing 20 percent of all U.S. medical schools. Integrative medicine provides the platform to bring together traditional and alternative medical practices with allopath ic medicine. The field is patient-centered, recognizing that states of the mind are equally as important as states of the body in promoting health. Also, it is prevention-oriented but evidence-based. At the Center for Healt h and Healing in New York, New York, a team of 9 physicians and 11 alternative practitioners work together and follow a model of pluralism that fosters tolerance and integration of biomedicine and CAM. In developing countries, 80 percent of the population uses indigenous health care practitioners for primary care. One project that has been tracking the usage of CAM abroad is the Plants and People of Micronesia Project, which has been ongoing since 1998 in Pohnpei, an island in the Eastern Caroline Islands. The study is tasked w ith documenting ethnobotanical and ethnomedical practices, and looking at the transfer of traditional knowledge from parents and grandparents to youth. Thus far, information has been gathered on about 30 percent of the lo cal and introduced flora. An example of a traditional use of a botanical in Pohnpei is the use of Morinda citrifoli in handicrafts, treatment of infection and wounds, parasites, men's health, postpartum conditions, and rheumatism. Traditional varieties of plants also are used as foods. A current project is compiling infor mation on traditional Micronesian plant use to develop the Primary Health Care Manual. The manual contains basic m edical information, organized into chapters by specific conditions. Future applications of the Pri mary Health Care Manual could help create a more sustainable health system in Pohnpei that nurtures commu nication between the health care providers, Biodiversity and Human Health: A Multidisciplinary Approach To Examining the Links The Office of Research and Development's National C enter for Environmental Research 16 traditional healers, and patients. The manual will also be used in the Ethnomedicine Fellowship Training Program, which is being developed to train physicians in Poh npei and Palau on traditional plant use in primary health care. Discussion Dr. Newman noted that once information is published, it i s considered prior art. Thus, the information mentioned in the manual, if intended for use in the development of a product, would have to fall under a use patent. Dr. Lee responded that the intellectual property can be an entire symposium topic unto itself. One of the most important aspects of obtaining the plant information i s to attribute that knowledge to the host on the island. Dr. Newman commented again that this issue has arisen in other countries, and once that material becomes published, the information automatically eliminates any patent possibilities because it is then considered prior art. Dr. Graham Hickling observed that many of the environmental d egradation problems are generating health problems in indigenous societies, but many of the peoples in these places do not take practical measures (e.g., filtering water). Yet, these societies house a wealth of informat ion on ethnomedicine. Dr. Lee responded that one hope is for the Primary Health Care Manual to bring some of that common sense knowledge into the detailed knowledge of the ethnobotanical practices. APPLICATIONS TO THE GLOBAL EARTH OBSERVATION SYSTEM OF SYSTEMS GEOSS: A Global Earth Observation System of Systems fo r Science and Informed Decisions and Actions Jos\u00e9 Achache, Group on Earth Observations The Earth is a complex system of systems, and data are requir ed from multiple observation networks and systems. Specifically, there is a need for a system that provi des access to all Earth observation data in standard interoperable formats. The intergovernmental Group on Earth Ob servations (GEO) comprises 65 countries, the European Commission, and 43 participating organizations. Th e goal of GEO is to build a Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS) over the next 10 year s, to provide a comprehensive, coordinated, and sustained system of observing systems. The database syst em will be used by a range of science communities and will integrate various systems, including s pace-, air-, cryosphere, land-, and ocean-based systems. An example of the application of integration of dat a and systems is the prediction of hantavirus risk from Landsat imagery over time. A user-driven process, GEO aim s to improve and coordinate the observation systems, provide easier and more open data access, foster use thro ugh science and applications and, ultimately, answer society's need for informed decisionmaking. Current wo rk is focusing on the prediction capabilities of when and where the next outbreaks of diseases such as malaria and cho lera are likely to happen using advanced earth observations of weather, climate, drought, and air q uality. A next step will be to understand how to manage biodiversity in ecosystems so that services the y provide could lessen and possibly prevent disease outbreaks. The plan for GEOSS is to serve nine Societal Benefit Areas: reduction and prevention of disasters, human health and epidemiology, energy management, climat e change, water management, weather forecasting, ecosystems, agriculture, and biodiversity. GEO w ill engage a wide range of actors to move observations toward socioeconomic benefits. Among the necessary co mponents will be Earth observations, decision support tools development, Earth scientists, publi c and private information, and officials, advocacy groups, and the public. These components are represented by the u mbrella concept of a GEOSS Users Community of Practice. A voluntary process, GEO will fost er international cooperation and synergies and will depend on the goodwill of its members and participating org anizations. The greatest challenge will be in achieving the final stage of disseminating information to reach citizens so that they can benefit from the early warning systems to prevent disease outbreaks and natural disas ters. The architecture of GEOSS will be finalized before the end of this year. Biodiversity and Human Health: A Multidisciplinary Approach To Examining the Links The Office of Research and Development's National C enter for Environmental Research 17 Discussion Dr. Aral commented that GEO is a primary and necessary organization and th at many uses will be found for the database, which is being assembled. Is there any group in GEO that is going to examine historical data, put it together, and make that available online? Dr. Achache respo nded that data archiving is underway and many datasets are already archived. Dr. Aral added that his concern is regarding historical data that goes back thousands of years in the Chinese, Japanese, and Indian archives . Will these be included in the archive? Dr. Achache responded that there is no initiative for this immediat ely. It is likely that many organizations and other countries will be pleased to get together and coordinate ar chiving historical and prehistorical data. Dr. Berke asked whether the organization plans to study the so cioeconomic dimension in terms of data collection and to spatially portray those kinds of databases. For instance, in a pending disaster, there could be good observations of exposure to a tsunami, earthquake, or p erhaps a disease, but because of the social characteristics or features of different ethnic groups, the vulner abilities of human health exposure to the event are not going to be equivalent. Dr. Achache responded that GEO is initiating a study not only on socioeconomic benefits, but also covering an aspect that is relevant to decisionmakers\u2014a cost-benefit analysis of using GEOSS versus not having the good observations an d science. WILDLIFE TRADE AND RISKS TO BIODIVERSITY AND HEALTH The Trade in Wild Animals: A Threat to the Health of Pe ople, Domestic Animals, and Wildlife Robert Cook, Wildlife Conservation Society Established as the New York Zoological Society in 1895, the Wildlife Conservation Society is dedicated to ensuring a future for wildlife and wild lands. The Societ y founded the first field veterinary program in 1989 to examine the connections between people, domestic animals, and wi ldlife; this paradigm was named \"One World, One Health.\" Currently, humanity is plagued by 1,40 7 known pathogens, 58 percent of which are zoonotic. Four main driving forces that need to be examined are increases in human population, global climate change, intensified agricultural practice, and globalization and trad e. Although the global agricultural trade is well defined, the global wildlife trade is not because much of it is illegal; this trade poses a large health threat to people and other animals. Of particular concern is the trade and introduction of exotic, alien, and non-native or invasive plants and animals. Annually, tens of millions of wild animals are shipped for food, pets, and traditional medicines. In early 2003, more than one-third of the legal global meat trade was embargoed as a result of bovine spongiform encephalopathy, avian influenza, and other livestock disease outbreaks. Each year, 350 million live plants and animals are shipped globally; app roximately 40,000 of those are live primates; 4 million live birds; and 640,000 live reptiles; and each of t hese groups is associated with diseases that have the potential for transfer to humans and other animals. Regarding trade at the local and regional level, wild meat consumption in Central Africa is 1 billion kilograms per year, which is roughly 200 million animals per year. By placing the animals in unsanitary, stressful situations, and with people working in close proximity with those animals, a health risk situation is nurtured. In the cas e of avian influenza, the poultry share living space with people on the farms and are free to roam about. Wild bird s are known to be the reservoir for low-pathogen avian influenza, but not for high-pathogen avian influenza. Whe n the wild birds are mixed with the domestic birds (where sanitation is poor) and animals are stressed, the virus has the opportunity to mutate and efficiently pass to human animal handlers. Part of the challenge of predi cting avian influenza is tracking the migratory patterns of the birds. To facilitate this area of study, the Global Avian Influenza Network for Surveillance (GAINS) was formed to train people worldwide to test samples from birds as well as to report the migration of healthy birds. Working with partners, a database is being creat ed to share among scientists and interested parties, and the GAINS Web Site is operational. The goal is t o produce models to predict avian influenza movement worldwide. An example of training in the field began in 2005, with instruction to Mongolian scientists on how to sample for avian influenza in the field. This training should create a standard from which to compare changes in the environment over time. To lessen the emer gence and reemergence of zoonotic disease, there is a need for wildlife surveillance systems, expand ed inspection and quarantine systems, and improved communication between agencies, governments, and NGOs. Biodiversity and Human Health: A Multidisciplinary Approach To Examining the Links The Office of Research and Development's National C enter for Environmental Research 18 Discussion Dr. Randolph asked about the current view of the relative im portance of natural migration of birds and the illegal trade in poultry in terms of spreading agents of dis ease. This information is not known, Dr. Cook responded, and the current study is working to collect these data. The team has been able to identify birds moving within a region, but whether these wild birds are t ruly able to carry the disease is not yet known. The team also lacks information on the poultry trade, because it is illegal. He added that there are frequent articles in the newspapers about confiscations of thousands of pound s of illegally traded poultry in the States and in Europe. VALUATION OF BIODIVERSITY BENEFITS TO HUMAN HEALTH OUTCOMES Biodiversity Conservation, Climate Change, and Human Health Subhrendu Pattanayak, RTI International Work was undertaken to examine climate change, human health, and bi odiversity conservation and the valuation of biodiversity in the context of disease regulation in Brazil. The broad questions being addressed include: How does the environment (ecosystem) contribute to human welfare, especially via the human health pathway? What are some of the most significant ecosystem changes w here expected environmental health outcomes occur, such as climate change or protected areas? What conceptu al approaches and modeling tools can be used to address these types of questions (e.g., spatial, multimethod)? Information from the literature suggests that human health is affected adversely by climate change, a nd that alteration of the habitat, such as through deforestation, increases malaria risk. Brazil was employ ed as an ideal laboratory for the study because the country experiences strong variation in several variables, i ncluding climate, biodiversity, health, landscape, and education. Brazil also has some of the highest levels of def orestation in the world, is vulnerable to climatic changes, and has among the best public policy data available ov er time and space in the tropics. The study analyzed public data on approximately 500 microregions to estimat e climate and conservation impacts on morbidity. Studies included estimating econometric models us ing the cross-sectional variation in morbidity, climate, and conservation data. Models controlled for such variab les as demographics, health care access, income, and other regional characteristics. Past work has shown t hat warmer, wetter climate is positively associated with morbidity and that deforestation is positivel y correlated with malaria. A computational general equilibrium (CGE) model was used to give a picture of the eco nomic consequences of climate change and morbidity; the model is calibrated for current and projected co nditions in Brazil. When no action is taken at baseline, and climate is permitted to affect morbidity and defor estation, the model predicts a reduction in effective labor supply of 0.47 percent. Under one policy scenari o accounting for the conservation of 50 million hectares of forests by 2010, morbidity impacts are reduced to 0 .39 percent by the elimination of deforestation. Accompanying climate change impacts is a reduction in the gross do mestic product, investments, and imports; these three measures increase with forest conservation. Future extens ion of the work will include disaggregation of labor and conservation by region and a review of all interactions and feedbacks with conservation and climate scenarios, and with climate change mitigatio n policies. The research has emphasized the need for a multidisciplinary and multimethod approach to ad dress biodiversity, environment, and human health issues. Discussion Dr. Achache commented that one result of deforestation in Br azil is the creation of biofuels, the commercialization of which will generate a tremendous amount of wealth once that material is exported. How can this outcome be factored into the model? Dr. Pattanayak res ponded that with this model, these effects are the net of the loss that Brazil is suffering because it cannot cu t a lot of the species to use in agriculture. Thus, the health effects are mediating some of the production effects fro m taking land away from agriculture. Biofuels may not be in the model, but they are easy to add. This model is made to answer that question. There are tradeoffs, however, and you will lose something to gain s omething else. The question is, are the gains higher than the losses? Biodiversity and Human Health: A Multidisciplinary Approach To Examining the Links The Office of Research and Development's National C enter for Environmental Research 19 A participant commented that it seems conservation is occurring in the Amazon proper, while biofuel and soybean industries are growing outside the Amazon proper and much biodiversity loss is taking place outside the areas where protected areas are to be created. He stated that he was su rprised to learn that much of the economic loss is attributed to taking land out of productio n for soybeans, and meanwhile, it seems it may be because land that is being taken out of production in the mod el is not soybean land nor is it biofuel land; it is very wet areas in the Amazon proper. Dr. Pattanayak responded that one future extension was to try to keep track of landfills, the benefit of landfills, and once we disag gregate this, we will begin to see some of the effects being discussed. Closing Remarks Gary Foley, EPA/ORD/NCER Dr. Foley extended his gratitude to Drs. Pongsiri and Ro man, and all the organizers of the workshop. This event has provided a venue in which to examine a problem in which many people are interested and it has drawn attention to the fact that complex problems require inno vative approaches. Innovation requires people to think collaboratively, to take a multidisciplinary approach, an d to try to accomplish things faster. Dr. Foley referred to comments made by Michael Leavitt, who is now the Secret ary of Health and Human Services and who was the former Administrator of EPA, to an audience abou t 18 months ago, that the world needs acceptance of networks. GEO is one such network into which it w ill be critical to invest. Dr. Leavitt's parting words reminded the audience that those who get better at collabor ation will prosper. What is needed now is to learn to want collaboration. Dr. Foley encouraged the participan ts to leave their feedback on the comment form or to send e-mail comments to him, or to Drs. Pongsiri or Roman, on ideas to build a network that can help the various disciplines work together and address problems in par allel. He concluded by thanking the participants for attending, and the speakers for their excellent presentation s. The meeting was then adjourned. Abstracts Biodiversity and Human Health: A Multidisciplinary Approach To Examining the Links The Office of Research and Development's National C enter for Environmental Research 21 Biodiversity and the Dilution Effect: The Case of Lyme Disease Richard S. Ostfeld Institute of Ecosystem Studies, Millbrook, NY The public values biodiversity largely for ethical and aesthetic reasons, and the focus of concern is largely devoted to vertebrates. In contrast, scientific research on the imp ortance of biodiversity focuses on ecosystem functions or services and is largely restricted to microbes and plants. This talk will describe a utilitarian function served by vertebrate diversity, namely, the protection of humans against exposure to zoonotic diseases. The focus will be on Lyme disease, a zoonosis in which ticks acquire the bacterial pathogen from vertebrate reservoir hosts and later transmit it to humans. T he blacklegged tick vector is a host-generalist, feeding from many different mammal and bird species, but only acquires Lyme bacteria efficiently from a few hosts, mainly white-footed mice and eastern chipmunks. The ti cks also appear to suffer low mortality when feeding from these rodents as compared to other mammalian and avi an hosts. High host diversity appears to reduce Lyme-disease risk to people via several distinct mechanisms . First, high host diversity presents the tick population with many opportunities to feed from hosts th at are highly inefficient at transmitting Lyme bacteria. Second, high-diversity communities appear to regulate the abund ance of white-footed mice via predation and competition. Third, high abundance of non-mouse hosts ser ves to deflect tick meals away from mice, thus reducing tick infestation of mice. By these mechanisms, high di versity appears to reduce both the infection prevalence of ticks and tick density, thereby reducing Lyme-dis ease risk. These effects of high vertebrate diversity constitute the \"dilution effect.\" In the northeastern and midwestern United States where Lyme dis ease is endemic, small forest fragments tend to sustain smaller numbers of species than do larger fores ted areas. Possibly as a consequence of reduced diversity therein, white-footed mice, and to some extent chip munks, tend to thrive in small fragments. Because small fragments support high abundance of rodent reservoirs b ut low overall diversity, these sites pose the highest risk of Lyme disease. This talk will use both emp irical and modeling approaches to assess the dilution effect for Lyme disease, ask whether the dilution effect applies b roadly to other zoonoses, and examine the mechanism by which it operates.

Guptill 3 1Division of Biological Sciences, University of Montana, Mi ssoula, MT; 2Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Infectious Diseases, Fort Collins, CO; 3National Center, U.S. Geological Survey, Reston, VA Factors accounting for geographic variation in West Nile virus (WNV) prevalence in the United States are poorly understood. Wild birds are the primary reservoir ho sts for WNV, but individual species vary considera- bly in virus competency, thus differences in avian diversity and community composition may help account for variation in virus amplification rates across habitats. Examin ing associations between passerine (Passeriform) and non-passerine (all other orders) bird diversity and WNV infection prevalence at two spatial scales in Louisiana, we found that non-passerine species richness was sign ificantly negatively correlated with both mos- quito infection rates and human disease incidence. By contrast, pas serine species richness was not correlated with either human or mosquito infections. Further analyses s uggested that the relative abundance of passerine to non-passerines in a habitat was a strong predictor of viru s amplification, with mosquito infection rates being significantly higher in habitats with higher passerine to n on-passerine ratios. These findings highlight important links between avian diversity and composition and W NV disease risk, and suggest that biodiversity effects on disease may be a general phenomenon applicable to the dyna mics of many vector-borne zoonoses. Biodiversity and Human Health: A Multidisciplinary Approach To Examining the Links The Office of Research and Development's National C enter for Environmental Research 23 Disease Emergence in Terrestrial and Marine Environ ments Rita R. Colwell University of Maryland-College Park, College Park, MD; Joh ns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, MD An environmental source of disease was hypothesized as early as th e late 19th century by Robert Koch, but not proven because of the inability to isolate Vibrio cholerae , the causative agent of cholera, from the environment between epidemics. Much has changed in the past 100 year s, but still standard bacteriological procedures for isolation of microorganisms from environmen tal samples, including water, between epidemics generally were unsuccessful, and now it is common knowledge th at less than 1 percent of microorganisms in the environment have been cultured in the laboratory. Dormancy, s porulation, loss of culturability when conditions are unfavorable for growth, and reproduction are con ditions of life amongst microorganisms that make it difficult to assess their presence. Furthermore, the asso ciation of V. cholerae with zooplankton, sporadicity and erraticity of cholera epidem ics, which now have been correlated also with climate and climate events, including El Ni\u00f1o. Because zoopl ankton have been shown to harbor the bacterium and zooplankton blooms follow phytoplankton bloo ms, remote sensing has been successfully em- ployed to determine the relationship of cholera epidemics with s ea surface temperature (SST), sea surface (SSH), chlorophyll, turbidity, and related environm ental factors. Cholera occurs seasonally in Bangladesh, with two annual peaks in the number of cases. From clinical data and data obtained from remote sensing, it has been found that when the height of the ocean is high (SSH) and SST also is elevated, cholera cases are most numerous. SST, SSH, and blooms of plankton have been significantly correlated with cholera epidemics and selected climatological factors and incidence of V. cholerae recorded, making possible prediction of cholera epidemics, both their geographical locatio n and intensity. Other disease agents are recognized as having an environmental source (e.g., avian influenza, hantavirus, Campylobacter , etc.). Clearly, a holistic approach to infectious diseases, taking into account environmental parameters, is required for public health safety in the 21st century. Biodiversity and Human Health: A Multidisciplinary Approach To Examining the Links The Office of Research and Development's National C enter for Environmental Research 24 Emergence of Tick-Borne Pathogens in the Northeast United States Durland Fish Center for EcoEpidemiology, Yale Institute for Biospheric Studies, New Haven, CT; Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, CT A total of seven tick-borne pathogens capable of infecting hum ans circulate within natural zoonotic cycles in the Northeastern United States. Five of these have emerged wit hin the past four decades. Four tick species vector these seven pathogens, but five of them are vectored by a si ngle tick species, Ixodes scapularis. Recent range expansion of I. scapularis and Amblyomma americanum explains the emergence of most new pathogens, but slow recognition of clinical cases in humans also can contri bute to emergence. Range expansions of tick species with overlapping host preferences provide new opportuni ties for cross species transmission of patho- gens among vertebrate hosts and vectors. Predicting disease emerg ence and developing intervention strategies is a challenge to public health agencies. Changes in biodiversity greatly impact the risk of tick-bor ne infections for humans. Increased host diver- sity may not only reduce the force of transmission for one pathogen, but also it may increase the overall diversity of both tick vectors and transmissible pathogens. Management decisions affecting biodiversity should consider the potential public health consequences, both positiv e and negative, to avoid potential conflicts. An aggressive and interdisciplinary effort to balance the interests of biological conservation and public health is long overdue.

Berke 1, Stephanie E. Chang 2, Jacqueline Alder 2, William Rees 2, Beverley J. Adams 3, and Ratana Chuenpagde 4 1University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill , NC; 2University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada; 3ImageCat, Inc., Long Beach, CA; 4Coastal Development Centre, Bangkok, Thailand To what extent did coastal ecosystem degradation increase the vuln erability of coastal communities in the December 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami disaster? To what extent do co mmunity-based social capital (features of social organization such as networks and trust that enable collect ive action) and international aid delivery systems influence village performance in mangrove protection? Th is exploratory study addresses these questions based on perspectives from the biophysical and soci al sciences. The initial focus is on the Andaman coast of Thailand. The biophysical phase of the study uses data from satellite im agery. We conducted remote sensing analy- sis to identify pre-disaster mangrove change and post-disast er structural damage and landscape changes (see Figure 1). We gathered field data at five sites (20 villages), deploying the VIEWS data collection system, to validate and supplement this analysis. A major finding was th at mangroves are one of many factors that influenced tsunami damage intensity, but they appear to have been an effective buffer against tsunami forces. Villages that were behind substantial mangrove forests suffered relatively little damage, while otherwise comparable villages that were not so protected were devastated. The social science phase entailed an evaluation of 6 of the 20 vil lages. During August 2005, semi- structured interviews were conducted with 18 local leaders who w ere knowledgeable and influential about mangrove ecosystem management and disaster recovery in their villag es. Field observations also were under- taken to verify tsunami impacts and mangrove protection practices . An interview protocol was derived from the World Bank's Social Capital Assessment Tool to: (1) gauge village performance in mangrove protection; (2) determine the level of social capital in the village; and (3) assess the role of external aid delivery organi- zations. A major finding was that social capital was not consistently related to the extent to which villages under- took mangrove conservation practices. Although social capital was clearly high or moderately high in all 6 villages, there was considerable variation in the level of conserv ation practices. In villages with high levels of social capital, performance in conservation drops when external org anizations deny grassroots-level networks to respond to local conservation needs. In contrast, the highes t performing village in conservation efforts had strong social capital that was activated when external organizations took a bottom-up approach in dealing with local people. The combination of strong internal bonding and strong linkages with external organizations dur- ing the recovery period led to considerable improvement in mang rove conservation practices. Policy and research implications of these findings are discussed. Award No.: National Science Foundation: SES-0522963.

Biodiversity and Human Health: A Multidisciplinary Approach To Examining the Links The Office of Research and Development's National C enter for Environmental Research 27 Soils, Biodiversity, and Links to Human Health Diana H. Wall Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO The inclusion of soil organisms (both microbes and fauna) as causal agents of human disease is generally considered as being limited to tropical or less developed countr ies, but it is a global issue. Information on the triggers, biotic and/or abiotic that drive the incidence of soi l organism-related disease is fragmented and disci- plinary. The pathology of the soil organism in causing dis ease is often studied in isolation and rarely related to its natural history, soil habitat, or ecology. Soil biod iversity in less disturbed systems is determined by multi ple factors over evolutionary time, such as vegetation (chemical qualit y, quantity, plant species, and community composition), soil physical and chemical properties, and climate. Environmental factors leading to higher incidence of soil-borne organisms and human disease, such as di sturbance to soil, climate change, increasing human population, poverty, and the resulting impact on soil food webs should be integrated to better predict disease occurrence. Disturbances to soil impact ecosystem functi oning, soil physical and chemical factors, alter soil biodiversity, and appear to be associated with the loss o f ecosystem services such as control of pathogen- predator outbreaks. Understanding the relationships between so il, biodiversity, and links to human disease is a new interdisciplinary challenge that is central to an ecosystem app roach to human health. Biodiversity and Human Health: A Multidisciplinary Approach To Examining the Links The Office of Research and Development's National C enter for Environmental Research 28 Biodiversity Loss and the Ecology of Infectious Dis ease Transmission Among People, Primates, and Domestic Animals in Kibale Na tional Park, Uganda Tony Goldberg University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL Infectious diseases transmitted among humans, non-human prim ates, and domestic animals represent an emerging threat to human health, animal health, and primate conserv ation. The Kibale EcoHealth Project en- deavors to improve our understanding of how biodiversity reductions alter interspecific infectious disease transmission risks in and near Kibale National Park, a mid- elevation forested park near the foothills of the Rwenzori Mountains in western Uganda. Project data indicate that f orest fragmentation has led to 75 percent reductions in non-human primate biodiversity. These dramati c reductions in primate biodiversity have led to the competitive release of some species, resulting in changes in pr imate density and behavior; these changes in turn have led to increased prevalence of a broad variety of directly transmitted and water-borne pathogens in non-human primates of pathogenic enterobacteria). Epidemiologi cal sur- veys of domestic animals living near forest fragments impli cate cattle, goats, and sheep as reservoirs and con- duits of infection between people and primates. Molecular analyses of bacteria isolated from humans living near forest boundaries or employed in primate-directed eco-touri sm indicate that specific human behaviors that increase ecological overlap between people and primates also accelerate micro bial transmission rates. Patterns of antibiotic resistance in these same bacteria show that human-liv estock-primate microbial transmission risk is spatially structured, with forest fragmentation being a key f actor accelerating transmission. Spatially explicit analyses suggest that the link between biodiversity loss and h uman-primate disease transmission is mediated by human behavior, primate behavior, and hydrology. A worki ng model of this process is that: (1) human be- havior (driven by socioeconomic and cultural factors) causes fores t fragmentation and plant biodiversity declines; (2) non-human primate biodiversity declines rapidly in response to these changes, and the remaining primates experience dramatic demographic and behavioral changes; (3) al terations in primate demography and behavior \"force\" primates into atypical ecological interactions, inclu ding interactions with humans and livestock; (4) these atypical ecological interactions lead to increased disease transmission risk; and (5) these processes are most pronounced in low-lying forest fragments, where primate population densities are high, human encroachment rates are high, and hydrological processes create p hysical reservoirs for environmentally persistent pathogens. A fine-scale understanding of the mechanis ms by which anthropogenically driven biodiversity declines alter interspecific infectious disease transm ission risks between people and non-human primates will be essential for the formation of improved con servation and public health strategies that would benefit human health on both a local and global scale.

Despite a long history, the city remains fairly isolated from much of the rest of the region and histori- cal entomological surveys make this an excellent site to examine t he impact of human development on vector- borne diseases, such as malaria. During 2000-2001, collaborat ors undertook studies to examine the relationship between the abundance of Anopheles darlingi , a major vector of human malaria in South America, and defor- estation that accompanied human activity. This discussion focuses on the relationship between deforestation and human landing rates. A. darlingi was much more common in deforested areas than in regions that remained relatively undisturbed, even when accounting for the presence of humans. This is interpreted to represent a significant increase in human disease risk for malari a transmission. This study provides a good example of both the strengths and challenges of establishing the relationship between human activities, bio- diversity, and public health.

Randolph, G. Hendrickx, and P. Reiter Emerging Diseases in a Changing European Environment, Mon tpellier, France In recent years, several vector-borne, parasitic or zoonotic diseases have (re)-emerged and spread in dif- ferent parts of the world, with major health, ecological, socio -economical, and political consequences. Most of these outbreaks are linked to global and local changes resulting f rom climate change, human-induced land- scape changes, or the activities of human populations that affect t he ecology of the diseases and risk of infec- tion. EDEN (Emerging Diseases in a changing European eNvironment, www.eden-fp6project.net) is an on- going integrated project of the European commission that aims to identify, evaluate, and catalogue European ecosystems and environmental conditions linked to global chan ge, which can influence the spatial and temporal distribution and dynamics of human pathogenic agents. The final project objective is to develop methods, tools, and skills such as predictive models of em ergence and spread, and novel approaches for early warning, surveillance, and monitoring. These can be used by decision makers for risk assessment, and decision support for intervention and public health policies. The pro ject integrates research in 47 leading institutes from 24 countries, and the eco-geographical diversity of the project area covers all relevant European eco-systems from the polar circle in the north to the Mediterranean basin and its link with West Africa in the south, and from Portugal in the west to the Danube delta in the east. EDEN is organized into a series of vertical sub-projects focus ed on \"indicator diseases\", linked together by a series of integrative activities that include environmental ch ange detection, disease modelling, and biodi- versity monitoring. More specifically, this last field expl ores the interactions between pathogens, vectors, hosts, and their environment in terms of interfaces in time an d space, co-adaptation and selection, population and community dynamics. Example of ongoing activities relevant to the current discussion of the impact of biodiversity on human health will be selected from the tick-bo rne diseases (TBD) and West Nile (WN) sub- projects. Within the TBD project, data are being collated on the impact of environmental changes or human inter- vention on the availability of wildlife and livestock hosts; these include a range of large wildlife species and livestock as hosts for (adult) ticks, and rodents as transmi ssion hosts for tick-borne encephalitis virus and Lyme borreliosis spirochetes. Given the paucity of historical data on tick populations, new intensive fieldwork at four to six sites in each of 11 countries over 3 years wil l allow us to relate the spatially variable abundance and/or seasonal dynamics of local tick populations, and the prev alence of their infection with tick-borne pathogens, to current host diversity and abundance. Within the WN project, contrasting disease patterns are explored , from endemic foci in Africa to sporadic incursions in European wild avifauna areas or urban transmiss ion in Bucharest. Wild birds are involved in the transmission and the spread of WNV, but diversity in vecto rs and virus populations also are key elements of the natural history of the disease in Europe. Effects of area-s pecific community dynamics, invasion pathways, and biodiversity sanctuaries (notably in river deltas) are assess ed.

Newman Natural Products Branch, Developmental Therapeutics Program , National Cancer Institute, Frederick, MD For millennia, humans (and animals) have utilized plants as so urces of medications, simply proceeding on the basis of what worked to alleviate \"pain and suffering\". Wit h the identification in the early 1820s of mor- phine from the opium poppy, the following two centuries h ave seen the isolation and identification of large numbers of active agents from all sources, a significant number of which have become and still are, medicinal agents used world-wide. About 25 years ago, the use of natur al product materials as leads to novel agents in industry went into decline, but these are now beginning to co me back into play as a source of \"chemical skeletons\", due in part to the lack of success of its replacement, combinatorial chemistry as a lead generator. Couple to this, the realization from genetic analyses, that what was originally thought to be the source or- ganism, may actually be a single-celled organism in a large numb er of cases, then the paradigm should shift from \"conservation of the host organism (e.g., a tree/plant)\" t o \"we need to identify the microbe(s) involved and their host environment\". As a result, one can now say th at the most diverse \"set\" of organisms on the planet are those that we cannot see, and guesstimates of the number of species are well above 10 30 . Thus, the loss of hosts is only the part that one can see, the true l osses are significantly larger. Examples of important materials and the possibilities for the future involving m icrobial sources (and their hosts) will be presented.

The evolution of this new form of medicine is catalyzed by the realization of many medical educators and practitioners that other methods of treatment used in traditi onal cultures can benefit patients, especially those with chronic diseases. Does this new form of medicine add to cu ltural preservation or further devolution of ancient medical practices by subsuming the old within the new? W hat is the role of ethnobotany, ethnomedi- cine, and biodiversity? How can medicine support traditional h ealers as more modern skills sets are offered? Is there a relationship in ethnobotany and biodiversity to health ? What are the applications in underserved devel- oping areas of the world? These questions will be discussed i n relationship to the Plants and People Project in Micronesia, a multidisciplinary ethnobotanical, medical, and ecolog y project begun in 1998 under the direction of Michael Balick, Ph.D., from The New York Botanical Garden, and Roberta Lee, M.D., Medical Director of the Center for Health and Healing at Beth Israel Medical Center in N ew York. The project focus has been to establish a botanical checklist, begin an initiative to record tr aditional/cultural use of plants for medicine, housing, and other uses as well as record specific information on traditional medicine beliefs. The specific area of study has focused on Pohnpei, an island in the Eastern Car oline Islands that is known as one of the islands in the Federated States of Micronesia. These islands are considered o ne of the biodiversity \"hot spots\" in the world\u2014an area with a high concentration of endemic plants that are at risk of habitat loss. The project now in its eighth year is expanding to other islands within the Fed erated States of Micronesia. The project has included contributions from more than 100 Micronesian partici pants. The participants have included acknowl- edged traditional medicine elders and Micronesian conservationists and each has provided invaluable ethnobotanical editorial assistance during this project. This co -operative effort will produce a compilation of its ethnobotanical findings in a text due out for publication in the spring of 2008. In addition, a primary health manual on traditional Micronesian plant use on Pohnpei is und er development.

Cook 1 and William B. Karesh 2 1Wildlife Health Sciences, Wildlife Conservation Society, Bron x, NY; 2Field Veterinary Program, Wildlife Conservation Society, Bro nx, NY Increasingly diseases are moving between people, domestic animals, and wildlife, creating concerns about food safety, public health, and wildlife conservation. 1 Some of these diseases have been with us for millennia, while others are emerging or re-emerging, gaining the abilit y to jump between species and overloading our traditional methods of disease surveillance and prevention. In a list of 1,407 human pathogens, 58 percent are known to be zoonotic. There are 177 that are categorized as emerg ing or reemerging, and zoonotic pathogens are twice as likely to be in this category versus nonzoonotic pat hogens. 2 The local hunting of wildlife or bushmeat is an ancient pract ice that forms the fabric of community culture at the rural wildlife interface. Although these fundamental pr actices have always posed a cross-species disease risk to the local community, they have been mitigated through cultural practices. Ecological change such as those brought on by increases in human population density, forest fragmentation via road building and rural development alter the relationships of pathogens to hosts. 3 This coupled with increased human movement and the globalized trade in animals for food and pets facilitate rapi d movement to distant sites and greater human- pathogen contact. 4 The World Trade Organization's 2005 statistics note that in 2004 the global merchandise trade rose by 21 percent to $8.9 trillion U.S. dollars, wi th agriculture accounting for $783 billion U.S. dollars. There is no breakdown of the share of trade in wildlife, but each year roughly 350 million live plants and wild animals are shipped globally. 5 The poorly regulated wildlife component of global trade facili tates infections via microbial travel at scales that not only cause human disease ou tbreaks but also threaten livestock, interna- tional trade, rural livelihoods, native wildlife populations , and the health of ecosystems. 6,7,8 1 Kuiken T, FA, 2005;309:1680-1681. 2 Woolhouse Gowtage-Sequeria S.

Biodiversity and Human Health: A Multidisciplinary Approach To Examining the Links The Office of Research and Development's National C enter for Environmental Research 35 Valuation of Biodiversity Benefits to Human Health Outcomes Subhrendu Pattanayak RTI International, Research Triangle Park, NC Part of the puzzle surrounding biodiversity loss lies in an incomplete understanding of how humans value the functions and services that flow from biodiversity conser vation. Unfortunately, there is a lot of smoke and mirrors surrounding the links between biodiversity conserv ation, climate change, human health, and social welfare. This paper revisits some aspects of ecosystem valuation \u2014purpose, methodology, and policy design and implementation by looking closely at the links between cli mate change, human health, and biodiversity conservation. We use publicly available data on Brazilian micro-reg ions to present a concrete empirical example of ecosystem valuation in the form of disease regulatio n by biodiversity conservation, against a backdrop of climate change. There is a small but growing lit erature that suggests that human health in tropical regions will be: (a) adversely impacted by climate change, and (b) biodiversity conservation will mediate this impact. For example, the establishment of parks and protected areas for preventing deforestation and associ- ated land uses can reduce illnesses such as malaria, which have signi ficant ecological risk factors. We employ econometric models of secondary data from Brazil to test these h ypotheses and estimate parameters that link climate change and biodiversity conservation to malaria cases. We then apply a dynamic computable general equilibrium (CGE) model to provide a comprehensive picture of the economic consequences of biodiversity and climate change. Although the most significant direct impact o f malaria is on the labor force, such labor market impacts are often the catalyst for economy-wide effects because o f spillovers onto other markets and sectors. In addition, climate change is a complex phenomena that w ill play out in the medium to long term and over a broad spatial landscape. Across such a time and space dimensi on, we also can expect to see other ecologically significant policies such as large-scale conservation i n Brazil. Thus, we feed the econometric parameters into a dynamic CGE, calibrated for current and projected conditions in Brazil, to measure impacts on gross domestic product, labor force, agricultural yields, commodity prices and wages, and forest cover. The methodology applied in this paper represents a rare example of h ow statistical estimation using secondary survey and administrative data can be combined with CGE models to evaluate climate change and conser- vation scenarios for policy design. Finally, we offer two co nclusions. First, conservation policymakers should consider outcomes of habitat conservation that lie outside th e traditional conservation paradigm by considering species saved and landscapes protected to be intermediate outputs i n the improvement of human welfare. It should always be possible to monetize, quantify, or at the ver y least identify these welfare impacts. Second, it is imperative that multidisciplinary teams conduct conservation \"policy experiments\" to identify causal outcomes (including defensible estimates of ecosystem values) to improve the design and evaluation of bio- diversity conservation policies. As indicated by this study, we join the growing chorus of sustainability scientists, eco-epidemiologists, socioecological systems modeler s, and biocomplexity researchers in calling for transdisciplinary research that recognizes the interrelationships am ong ecology, human behavior, economics, epidemiology, and physical processes.

September 15, 2006 Biodiversity and Human Health: A Multidisciplinary Approach To Examining the Links The Office of Research and Development's National C enter for Environmental Research 49 Biodiversity and Human Health: A Multidisciplinary Approach To Examining the Links Smithsonian Institution S. Dillon Ripley Center 1100 Jefferson Drive, SW Washington, DC 20004 September 15, 2006 Background The National Center for Environmental Research (NCER) at the U.S . Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Office of Research and Development has proposed a joint Ecosystem-Health research program to study the links between changes in biodiversity and risks to human health. NCER has a responsibility to undertake exploratory research on emerging scientific issues, and worksho ps are organized for these topical discussions. Studying the relationship between biodiversity and human healt h is a timely research opportunity. The loss of biodiversity is accelerating while infectious diseases appear to be emerging and reemerging at a faster rate. Research on the links between these two conditions can have an impo rtant impact on our view of biodiversity, the services provided by natural ecosystems, and how we manage them . In co-sponsorship with Yale University's Center for EcoEp idemiology, the Smithsonian Institution, and the World Conservation Union, EPA/NCER is planning an in terdisciplinary workshop of researchers, practi- tioners, and decisionmakers in ecology, public health, remote sen sing, and the social sciences. We will discuss the state of the science, refine research priorities, and begin discu ssions on how to integrate existing data into a monitoring and risk-forecasting network that aims to prevent or significantly mitigate risks of human disease and threats to biodiversity around the world. The workshop will bring together experts from a variety of disciplines, academia, nongovernmental organizations, and management agencies from the United States and abr oad, to share expertise and information and to consider new approaches to characterize the relationship of biodiversity and human health, develop tools to help monitor and forecast risks, and manage risks t o health and the environment. In breakout groups, participants will address three specific tasks: 1. Case Studies on Biodiversity and Human Health Identify case studies and disease systems that could show or t est a clear linkage between biodiversity and human health. Discuss different mechanisms in which changes in b iodiversity can affect human health. What are the questions that could be applied across disease (established and/or new) systems? What are the likely outputs of such research? How can they be used by decisionmakers to improve health and the environment? 2. Risk Management and Policy Discuss risk management of environmental health problems and ho w to develop intervention strategies that reconcile conflicts between environmental and health concerns. Th is session can help address how the efforts of public health agencies to control outbreaks of vector -borne diseases can impact biodiversity. How can the mismatch in thinking between health and biodiversity exp erts and practitioners be addressed and resolved? What kinds of data/tools do managers need from scient ists that could be useful to decisionmaking? Biodiversity and Human Health: A Multidisciplinary Approach To Examining the Links The Office of Research and Development's National C enter for Environmental Research 50 3. Mapping Biodiversity and Human Health Discuss how to use Earth observation and field data to develop disease risk maps and spatial models to examine relationships between habitat alteration, biodiversity lo ss, changes in pathogen distribution, and the emergence and spread of vector-borne and zoonotic diseases. Disease r isk maps could be used as decision- support tools, enhancing the capacity to do surveillance and ri sk forecasting of ecosystem and human health, and they could enable the identification of areas suitable for pi lot projects to study the relationship between biodiversity change and risks to human health. The goals of this workshop are to improve understanding of the relationship between biodiversity and human health, and to identify research priorities from a multi disciplinary perspective as well as the research outputs that would be useful for decisionmakers charged with protecting public health and the environment. Workshop organizers are interested in publishing key findin gs in a prominent scientific journal. Biodiversity and Human Health: A Multidisciplinary Approach To Examining the Links The Office of Research and Development's National C enter for Environmental Research 51 Workshop Discussion: Case Studies on Biodiversity and Human Health September 15, 2006 Executive Summary In co-sponsorship with Yale University's Center for EcoEp idemiology, the Smithsonian Institution, and the World Conservation Union, EPA's NCER convened an interd isciplinary forum of researchers, practi- tioners, and decisionmakers in ecology, public health, remote sensing, and the social sciences. The workshop discussion \"Case Studies on Biodiversity and Human Health\" br ought together experts from a variety of disciplines, academia, government agencies, and non-governmental org anizations from the United States and abroad, to share expertise and information. The workshop par ticipants identified case studies that could test the links between biodiversity and health, mechanisms by which th ey could be connected, and guiding research questions that could be studied across different systems. There are case examples in which increases in biodiversity, among res ervoir hosts, vectors, and at the microbial and genetic levels, could lead to both positive and neg ative effects on health. The type of health effect linked to a change in biodiversity at a given taxonomic level (e.g., parasite diversity, fish community, landscape) can be determined by pathogen characteristics, community dy namics within the ecosystem, and human behavior. It is important to consider the social and eco nomic context of human behavior. Global and local anthropogenic drivers to biodiversity change include trad e and land use. The discussion was not limited in scope to human health effects , but also included animal health and economic and social well-being. The group identified case studies that could demonstrate or test a clear link between biodiversity change and risks to health. A spreadsheet was developed listing case studies, identifying for each the taxonomic level of biodiversity that is the driv er, disease/health response variable, and context/location of the system. Participants identified four ca tegories of scientific mechanisms by which biodiversity can affect health: Host/pathogen density and relative abundance. Contact, exposure, and transmission. Landscape heterogeneity. Human susceptibility. Conceptual and strategic questions were developed, as well as cri teria for prioritizing health issues. The group discussed the importance of crossing interdiscipli nary boundaries to advance knowledge, noting that barriers in language and culture must be overcome before diff erent methods and tools could be considered and integrated. Recommendations were made to facilitate interdiscipl inary research and training through the establishment of virtual centers and institutionally based wor king groups. Characterizing the relationship between biodiversity and health can reveal general principles and models that are transferable across health issues, and perhaps across spatial scales. New knowledge on how changes in biodiversity are related to health can lead to the development of models or tools to predict risks. This knowledge can inform decisionmaking to improve the management of our natural resources to protect the environment and public health. Workshop organizers are interested in continuing this discussion with participants to develop a scientific manuscript for publication. Biodiversity and Human Health: A Multidisciplinary Approach To Examining the Links The Office of Research and Development's National C enter for Environmental Research 52 Workshop Discussion: Mapping Biodiversity and Huma n Health September 15, 2006 Executive Summary The group was charged with developing a spatial method to stu dy the relationship between biodiversity loss and the emergence and reemergence of infectious disease. The group identified several areas and methods for testing hypotheses about this relationship. 1. Identify specific disease systems and their associated geographic areas . 2. Combine land-use and land-cover-change data, and other surrogates f or biodiversity loss, with geo- referenced disease data. 3. Investigate nonlinear, or threshold, responses via retrospectiv e analysis. This nonlinear response could be examined for changes in biodiversity and changes in infectious disease. 4. Develop a pilot geospatial analysis and decision-support too l for specific disease systems, including use of risk mapping for purposes of early warning, to target more intensive surveillance, and to develop surrogates that explain and use false positives. 5. What are the consequences of these research issues for developing o bservation strategies? It was recognized that there is a need for hierarchical analyses: coarse-scale g lobal screening could help identify areas for finer scale analyses based on indicators of change. 6. Investigate trade pathways. It is important to research how tr ade, tourism, and travel affect biodiversity and the transport of possible vectors. The group proposed using wiki-based technology to capture f urther discussions, link to papers, data, comments, and initiate a community of practice.

Identify case studies and disease systems that could show or t est a clear linkage between biodiversity and human health. Discuss different mechanisms in which changes in b iodiversity can affect human health. What are the questions that could be applied across disease (establ ished and/or new) systems? What are the likely outputs of such research? How can they be used by d ecisionmakers to improve health and the environment? Risk Management and Policy 2. Discuss risk management of environmental health problems and ho w to develop intervention strategies that reconcile conflicts between environmental and health concerns. Th is session can help address how the efforts of public health agencies to control outbreaks of vect or-borne diseases can impact biodiversity. How can the mismatch in thinking between health and biodiver sity experts and practitioners be addressed and resolved? What kinds of data/tools do managers need from s cientists that could be useful to decisionmaking? Mapping Biodiversity and Human Health 3. Discuss how to use Earth observation and field data to develop disease risk maps and spatial models to examine relationships between habitat alteration, biodiversity lo ss, changes in pathogen distribution, and the emergence and spread of vector-borne and zoonotic diseases. Disease risk maps could be used as decision-support tools, enhancing the capacity to do surveil lance and risk forecasting of ecosystem and human health; and, they could enable the identification of areas suitable for pilot projects to study the relationship between biodiversity change and risks to human heal th.
