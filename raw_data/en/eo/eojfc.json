Several influenza vaccines have been developed in an attempt to induce higher antibody responses that may increase effectiveness in older adults , including Fluad\u00ae , which is an adjuvanted vaccine with the same amount of antigen (15g haemagglutinin [ HA] per virus strain) as the standard inactivated influenza vaccine, Intanza\u00ae , which is an intradermally administered vaccine (15g HA/strain) , and Fluzone\u00ae High D ose vaccine, which has four times the concentration of infl uenza virus antigen as the standard inactivated influenza vaccine. As noted in the Statement on Seasonal Influenza Vaccine for 2015 -2016 (subsequent to the completion of the initial review of the literature) , Sanofi Pasteur confirmed that Intanza\u00ae is no longer available on the Canadian market , however studi es involving Intanza\u00ae are still summarized in this review as this announcement was not made until after the preparation of this report . Additionally, Fluzone\u00ae High Dose vaccine has since (Autumn 2015) received authorization for use in Canada. In one larg e randomized controlled trial, people 65 years and older who received Fluzone\u00ae High Dose were 18- 24% less likely to have laboratory -confirmed influenza than people who received Fluzone\u00ae (standard dose). Fluzone\u00ae High Dose vaccine has been shown to have sig nificantly higher rates of antibody production (seroc onversion, seroprotection (15 g HA/strain) . The high dose vaccine and the intradermal vaccine did induce higher rates of reaction post -injection than the standard dose, but they were short -lived. In conclusion, in people 65 years of age and older, the inactivated influenza vaccine containing higher doses of antigen (15 g HA/strain for intradermal vaccine and >15 g HA/strain for intramuscular vaccine) induced relatively higher serologic response s. Reduced influenza illness compared to the standard dose intramuscular inactivated vaccine was demons trated in a few studies . A higher rate of post -injection local adverse events was noted with the higher dose product. Note: An update to the literature review was conducted to find new studies indexed between June 27, 2014 and June 22, 2015. The additional literature included support to the original findings (see Section VII for more details). 4 | A REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE OF HIGH DOSE SEASONAL INFLUENZA VACCINE FO R ADULTS 65 YEARS AND OLDER I. INTRODUCTION Background The risk of becoming severely ill or dying when infected with influenza increases as adults age. During the influenza seasons from 2003 -04 through 2010- 11, excepting the pandemc of 2009, 55-65% of hospital s eparations in Canada and about 87% of deaths due to influenza occur red in citizens 65 years or older , although this age group only made up about 14% of the population1. Although vaccination against influenza is the best strategy to prevent illness2, studies show a reduced response to vaccines as people age3, with the presence of one or more chronic diseases a marker for reduced response4, 5. Immunosenescence is hypothesized to play a role in older adults' response to vaccines. Goodwin et al.3 estimate that, after adjusting for vaccine and host factors, rates of seroconversion and seroprotection in older adults were 50- 75% lower than that of younger adults. In a r ecent meta -analysis, Beyer et al.6 estimate that vaccine effectiveness against laboratory - confirmed influenza was about 49% (CI 95% 33, 62) in adults 65 years and older . This is lower than the effectiveness of 59% (CI 95% 51, 67) for healthy adults 18- 64 years old as estimated by Osterholm et al.7 in their meta -analysis of the literature . There is growing pressure to improve influenza vaccine effectiveness, especially in older adults who are at higher risk of complications when they contract influenza . There are influenza vaccines specifically formulated for older adults . Fluad\u00ae, which is available in Canada, is an adjuvanted vaccine that has 15g haemagglutinin of each strain in the vaccine and is injected intramuscularly ; Intanza\u00ae , which was previously available in Canada, has 15g haemagglutinin of each strain and is injected intradermally . The 15g formulation of Intanza\u00ae is considered high- dose compared to the 9g formulation that was intended for adults aged 18 to 59 years of age. Both the 9g and 15g intradermal products are no longer available in Canada. Fluzone\u00ae High Dose, which is authorized for use in Canada as of Autumn 2015, contains 60g of haemagglutinin per strain and is injected intramuscularly . Another vaccine referred to in this review is F lublok\u00ae. It is an intramuscular, recombinant influenza vaccine that uses insect cells in the replication process rather than chicken eggs and contains 45g of haemagglutinin of each strain. It is authorized in the United States of America for adults 18 years of age and older , but is not authorized in Canada. Purpose and Objectives The purpose of this report is to review, to assess, and to synthesize the currently available literature to determine whether the burden of influenza- related disease is lower in people 65 years and older (or subgroups thereof) who r eceive high dose triv alent inactivated influenza vaccine compared with those who receive dose inactivated trivalent , adjuvant influenza vaccines . II. METHODS This project includes information for adults 65 years and older, with no limit on their underlying health conditions. Publications with data from a wider range of age groups are included when subgroup data are available for some or all of the target age group (65 years and older). The review includes all high dose influenza vaccines, whether authorized or not , but with clear explication of whether they are authorized in Canada, experimental , or authorized in other 5 | A REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE OF HIGH DOSE SEASONAL INFLUENZA VACCINE FO R ADULTS 65 YEARS AND OLDER countriesa. The review excludes the 2009 H1N1pdm vaccine and experimental pandemic vaccines (e.g., H5N1 or H7N9). The literature search was conducted in three databases: Medline, Embase, and EBM reviews - Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. The search strategy was designed with the keywords and limits intended to capture all the articles in these databases that were relevant to the systematic review's disease, interventions, outcomes, population and time period of interest. The search strategy applied to each of the three databases on June 27, 2014 to capture records published since January 1, 2000 is detailed in Appendix A . Clinical trials registered on clinicaltrials.gov were also downloaded and matched, as possible, with existing publications. Two studies had data available but were not yet published, or published only as abstract. These data were included in the review. The search yielded 8338 non- duplicate records (Appendix B) . Two individuals screened t he titles and abstracts for relevance. Records were excl uded if it was clear from their title and abstract that their study population did not contain at least some proportion of adults aged 65 years and older , they were not influenza vaccine related, or if it was only about pandemic influenza vaccines and did not investigate season al influenza in any analyses. Finally, records were excluded if it was clear that their outcomes did not include any of : efficacy or effectiveness information ( laboratory -confirmed influenza, clinic orphysician visit, hospitalization, influenza- related mortality), immunologic al data (seroconversion, seroprotection, or antibody titres), or safety (reactogenicity, local, systemic, or adverse reactions). Upon applying these criteria, 7779 records were excluded. The remaining records were retrieved for full -text review. Each of the 559 articles retrieved for full -text review were screened again for relevance by two reviewers . Articles were only excluded if they were assessed as ineligible by both reviewers. If the first and second reviewers could not agree on the article's eligibility, the article was assessed by a third reviewer. Articles were designated as ineligible if they had greater than 10% of their study population either outside the age range or did not provide separate analysis for the age group of interest. Articles wer e also excluded if they did not present some data, whether through sub- group analyses or otherwise, that were about seasonal influenza vaccines , includ ing data about vaccine efficacy or effectiveness, immunogenicity, or safety or reactogenicity . In addition, secondary research articles were excluded, as well as articles that analyzed data that were already included in the review via another article (unless it added information pertinent to the review) . Lastly, studies were excluded if they contained insufficient information to assess its eligibility for the review or if it was a foreign language article that could not be reliably translated to and assessed in English. Based on these criteria 531 articles were excluded upon full -text review . All rema ining articles were assessed with regard to the level of evidence (see Appendix C, Table 1) and the quality of the study (see Appendix C, Table 2). Appendix D contains extracted information on efficacy and effectiveness , Appendix E on immunogenicity , and Appendix F on safety. a At the time of preparation of the initial report, Intanza\u00ae was authorized and available for use in Canada. As of the 2015-16 influenza season, Intanza\u00ae is no longer available in Canada, but studies using this vaccine as a high-dose comparator are still su mmarized in this review. 6 | A REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE OF HIGH DOSE SEASONAL INFLUENZA VACCINE FO R ADULTS 65 YEARS AND OLDER III. RESULTS III.1 Epidemiology Illnesses caused by influenza viruses occur throughout the year with widespread seasonal waves happening almost every year . The annual global attack rate of influenza is estimated at 5-10% in adults and 20 -30% in children8. Although rates of influenza infection are higher in children, rates of serious morbidity and mortality are highest in children younger than 2 years of age, adults 65 years of age or older, and people with underlying medical conditions8, 9. Molinari et al.12 estimated attack rates of 20% of American children under 5 years of age , 10% in children 5- 17 years, 6.6% in adults 18 to 64 years, and 9% in adults 65 years and older . Using the Canadian national surveillance system for monitoring influenza, FluWatch, from the 2011- 12 to 2013 -14 influenza season, seniors accounted for 21- 44% of all influenza detections per season. A larger proportion of seniors tested positive for influenza A(H3) subtype (range: 35-56% per season) compared to influenza A(H1) (8- 12%) or influenza B (20 -37%) in the past three seasons , however this is also attributed in part to the predominance of A(H3N2) during 2011- 12 and 2012- 13. The number of laboratory -confirmed outbreaks in long- term care facilities reported to FluWatch ranged from 180 in the predominantly A( H1N1 ) 2013 -2014 season to 676 in the predominantly A( H3N2 ) 2012- 2013 season13. An estimated 175,000 emergency department visits per year are attributable to influenza- related illnesses in Canada11, 14 1. Between 1997 and 2004, rates of visits to healthcare practitioners and emergency rooms for pneumonia and influenza- related illnesses were higher for Canadian children younger than 5 years of age (107/1000 ) and adults 65 years and older (81 /1000) than for people 5 to 64 years old (34/1000 )15. It is also estimated that an average of 12,200 influenza related hospital admissions occur annually in Canada1,11, 14. Rates of hospitalization due to influenza are highest in adults 65 years and older (18/1000 ), followed by rates of 8/1000 for children younger than 5 years and 1/1000 in people 5 to 64 years old15. Data reported to FluWatch from the PHAC/CIHR Influenza Research Network (PCIRN) Serious Outcomes Surveillance (SOS) network indicates that for the 2011- 12 through 2013- 14 influenza seasons, people 65 years and older accounted for 33- 68% of people hospitaliz ed and 34- 58% of people admitt ed to ICU who had laboratory -confirmed influenza. Adults 65 years and older account for approximately 15% of the Canadian population61. In Canada, as many as 4,000 deaths (range 300 to 6700 annually) may be caused, directly or indirectly, by influenza14, 16. The highest mortality rates are in people 65 years and older (108.8/100,000) followed by people 50- 64 years old (4.0/100,000) and people younger than 50 years (0.04/100,000)16. Even among older adults, the estimated risk of influenza- attributable death increases with age, fro m 23/100,000 Canadians 65- 69 years old to 831/100,000 in people 90 years and older17. The estimated risk of death due to influenza is abou t 12 times higher in older adults with chronic lung disease than those without chronic lung disease and about 5 times higher for those with heart disease than those without heart disease17. Data reported to FluWatch from the SOS network indicates that for the 2011- 12 through 2013- 14 influenza seasons, of people who had laboratory -confirmed influenza, people 65 years and older accounted for 55 -85% of those who died. The NACI annual statement on seasonal influenza vaccine contains a full background on influenza and a description of vaccines available for use in Canada . 7 | A REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE OF HIGH DOSE SEASONAL INFLUENZA VACCINE FO R ADULTS 65 YEARS AND OLDER III.2 Efficacy and Effectiveness Four studies comparing the relative efficacy of high dose vaccines were identified and described below. The relative e fficacy of Fluzone\u00ae High Dose (60g HA/strain) compared with Fluzone\u00ae (15g HA/strain) has been evaluated in two studies to date. The first study of 9158 ambulatory, medically -stable adults 65 years and older was conducted in 2009- 2010 during the H1N1 pandemic21. The relative efficacy was 12.5% in favour of Fluzone\u00ae High Dose against laboratory -confirmed influenza, but with exceedingly wide confidence bounds (CI 95% -140, 66) ; in this study 21 of the 22 symptomatic cases of influenza were caused by the A(H1N1)pdm 09 strain, which was not in the seasonal vaccine. The second study was conducted in 2011- 2012 and 2012- 201322. In this study of almost 32,000 older adults, 18 -24% fewer illnesses caused by influenza occurred in people who received Fluzone\u00ae High Dose compared with those who received Fluzone\u00ae (standard dose) . The relative efficacy against laboratory -confirmed infl uenza of the high dose vaccine compared to the standard dose vaccine was 18% ( CI95% 5,30) in participants who provided swabs when they had an acute respiratory illness , with 2.0% and 2.4%, respectively, diagnosed with influenza. The relative efficacy against laboratory -confirmed influenza was 24% ( CI95% 10,36) , with 1.4% and 1.9%, respectively, diagnosed with influenza, in those who provided swabs when they had an influenza- like illness (i.e., acute respiratory illness with systemic symptom(s)) . The relative efficacy of FluBlok\u00ae (~45 Fluzone\u00ae influenza was 25% (CI 95% -448, 96) in adults 65 years and older and 50% (CI 95% -76, 68) against culture - or serologic -confirmed influenza in this small (N=836) trial conducted in the USA23. FluBlok \u00ae is not a uthorized for use in Canada; in the USA, it is only authorized for use in adults 18- 49 years of age24. The relative effectiveness of Intanza\u00ae influenza 33 % (CI95% 15, 48) agai nst influenza- related hospitalization, for community -dwelling older adults in Spain25. This large (N=164,021) retrospective cohort study limited analysis to hospital admissions with either laboratory -confirmed influenza or a main hospital di scharge diagnosis of influenza in 2011- 2012. Neither of these vaccines are currently available in Canada. III.3 Serological criteria for assessment of influenza vaccines A common measure of immunogenicity is to assess the level of serum antibodies produced in response to antigens included in the vaccine through a laboratory test called a hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay. Seroconversion is measured as the proportion of participants with a minimum of a four -fold increase from pre- to post-immunization titres (1:10 to 1:40 at least 4-fold rise in antibody titres ). Seroprotection is a measure of the proportion of participants with a HI titre of 1:40 (or 1:32 in some studies) post -vaccination26 and is generally accepted as being correlated with a 50% reduction in the risk of influenza27. The geometric mean titre (GMT) is the geometric mean of the participants' (average of the logarithmic values of the titres) serum antibodies. The geometric mean fol d rise (GMFR) is the ratio of the post -vaccination/pre - vaccination serum anti -haemagglutinin antibody titres. When comparing two vaccines, there are two commonly used assessments: 1) the geometric mean titre ratio (GMTR), which uses the ratio of the post -vaccination GMT of people receiving each vaccine, and 2) the difference in the proportion of people who seroconvert in each group 27. 8 | A REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE OF HIGH DOSE SEASONAL INFLUENZA VACCINE FO R ADULTS 65 YEARS AND OLDER Non-inferiority of a new vaccine when comparing it to a licensed vaccine requires that: 1) the ratio of the post -vaccine GMT (GMT 1/GMT 0) has an upper -bound -sided 95% confidence interval (CI) of <1.5 [or lower bound of >0.67], and 2) the difference in seroconversion rates (seroconversion 1 - seroconversion 0) has an upper bound of 2 -sided 95% CI of <10 percentage points.

As stated in the previous section, there are three common measures of immune response: seroprotection, seroconversion, and level of antibody titres as measured by geometric means. High (>15 g HA/strain) versus Standard Dose (15 g HA/strain) Intramuscular Vaccines 60g HA/strain Inactivated Intramuscular Vaccines Four studies available at the time of this review compared the rates of seroconversion for study participants receiving vaccine containing 60g (high dose) versus 15g (standard dose) haemagglutinin (HA) per influenza strain. Rates of seroconversion were about 19 % higher (ranging from 10 -28%) for those receiving the higher dose vaccine - across all three strains in the vaccines and in all four studies28-32. In the two studies that assessed significance, the rates of seroconversion were significantly higher for all three strains in the vaccine28, 29. Similarly, rates of seroconversion were higher for those receiving the high compared to standard dose vaccines for participants 75 years and older and for a cohort of participants wi th underlying cardiopulmonary disease28. Five studies report higher rates of seroprotection for older adults vaccinated with the 60g/strain product compared to those vaccinated with 15g /strain vaccines21, 28-33. Four of the five studies assessed significance in these, seroprotection was significantly higher in the groups receiving the high dose vaccine for all three strains in three of the studies 28, 33, 34, but only against A(H1N1) in the fourth study29. The relative lack of difference in response to the high dose vaccine in the fourth study may be attributable to the fact that 78% of participants were vaccinated against the same influenza strains within 6 months prior to the study. Geometric mean titre ratios (GMTR) of participants' responses to the high versus the standard dose influenza vaccines were reported by several authors and were calculated for those that provided group -specific post -vaccination titres for each of the vaccines . Seroresponse to the B strains in the vaccines was about 1.5 times greater (1.3 -1.7) to the high dose vaccines than the standard dose vaccines. The GMTR of the A strains was about 1.8 times higher for thos e 9 | A REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE OF HIGH DOSE SEASONAL INFLUENZA VACCINE FO R ADULTS 65 YEARS AND OLDER receiving the high dose vaccines compared to the standard dose vaccines; ranging from 1.6- 2.3, depending on the study21, 28-33. One unpublished st udy35 followed older adults for two years following vaccination with either 15- or 60g HA/strain. There were no differences between the small (N=50) groups in their geometric mean antibody titres two years after vaccination. Authors of one study reported that older adults vaccinated with Fluzone\u00ae High Dose had higher rates of seroconversion and seroprotection and the ratio of post -vaccination geometric mean titres was significantly higher ( 1.3-1.4 to 1.0) for all three strains compared with those who received Intanza\u00ae (15g HA per Cioppa et al.36, 37 conducted a trial comparing the immune responses of a small number of older adults to a range of levels of H3N2 antigen (6- versus 12- and 15- versus 30g HA), a range of amounts of adjuvant (0- 100% of the amount used in the licensed vaccine, Fluad\u00ae), and intradermal compared with intramuscular administration. There were no significant differences in seroresponse between people who received 15g versus 30g HA of A(H3N2) antigen intramuscularly or people who received 6 g versus 12g HA of A(H3N2) antigen intradermally. A trial comparing nursing home resident who received a double dose (two injections of 15g HA/strain licensed influenza vaccine in the same arm on the same day) were compared with residents who received the standard single dose38. A significantly higher proportion of residents who received a double dose seroconverted and were seroprotected against the A(H3N2) strain 25 days after vaccination, and remained so 84 days afterwards. There were no differences between the groups 106 days after vaccination. Only results for the A(H3N2) strain were reported. 60g HA/strain Subunit Intramuscular Vaccines In 1988 Palache et al. 39 conducted a randomized controlled trial in which older adults living in nursing homes in the Netherlands re ceived 10- , The rates of seroprotection were higher for those who received the 60g HA/strain vaccine than the vaccines with lower doses. The geometric mean titre ratio did not change by dose for the A(H1N1) antigen. However, for people receiving the 60g/strain vaccine, the GMTR was 1.6 for A(H3N2) and 2.1 for the B strain compared to those receiving the 10g/strain vaccine. Recombinant Haemagglutinin Intramuscular Vaccines A randomized controlled trial comparing the recombinant influenza vaccine Flublok \u00ae, containing ~45g HA/strain with Fluzone\u00ae containing 15g/strain was conducted with community -dwelling people 65 years and older 23. The rates of seroconversion were significantly higher for both A strains of infl uenza for those receiving the higher dose vaccine. On the other hand, the rates of seroprot ection were similar for the two vaccines. The B strain could not be compared since the strains were not the same in the two vaccines. A randomized controlled trial compared the immunogenicity of several antigen levels of a recombinant influenza vaccine w ith Fluzone\u00ae containing 15 g/strain in participants 65 years and older40. The rates of seroprotection and seroconversion were higher for those receiving the 45g and 135g HA/strain of the recombinant vaccine than those receiving Fluzone\u00ae for the A(H3N2 ) strain but rates were similar for the A (H1N1 ) and B strains . In comparison, participants 10 | A REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE OF HIGH DOSE SEASONAL INFLUENZA VACCINE FO R ADULTS 65 YEARS AND OLDER receiving the 15g/strain of recombinant vaccine had similar responses to the A (H3N2 ) strain and lower responses to both the A( H1N1 ) and B strains than those receiving Intramuscular Vaccines Seve n randomized controlled trials have been conducted with older adults comparing the immune responses of 15g HA/strain intradermal influenza vaccines of seroconversion, seroprotection, and the GMTR were generally higher for people who received the high dose intradermal vaccine than those receiving standard dose intramuscular vaccines . However, in only two of the studies, both with large sample sizes, were the differences statistically si gnificant42, 46. Arnou et al.46 vaccinated older adults with the same vaccine annually for three years. Although rates of seroconversion and seroprotection were higher for those receiving the intradermal vaccine in the first year of the study, the rates were similar between the groups in t he next two years when the sample size greatly diminished. Holland et al.42 reported superior response to the intradermal vaccine compared with the standard dose intramuscular vaccine based on GMTR and significantly higher rates of serconversion for all three strains. The ratio of post -vaccination geometric mean titres for those vaccinated with the intradermal compared with intramuscular vaccines was about 1.3 times higher (range 1.0 to 1.8) across all studies study that compared seroresponses, a higher pe rcentage of participants receiving the 60g HA/strain intramuscular vaccine were seroprotected than those the 15g HA/strain intradermal vaccine 32. The post -vaccination geometric mean titres for those receiving the 60g HA/strain intramuscular vaccine were significantly higher than intradermal Vaccines Five randomized trials compared serological responses for older adults vaccinated with In one study with 905 participants, the adjuvanted intramuscular vaccine produced significantly higher rates of immunological response than the intradermal vaccine41 while the participants in the other four studies had similar rates of seroconversion, seroprotection, and had similar GMFR. The post-vaccination ratio of geometric mean titres for those vaccinated with inactivated intramuscular influenza vaccine with an adjuvant was slightly higher than those vaccinated with an intradermal vaccine - about 1.1 -1.2 (range 0. 9 to 1.3). III.5 Safety and adverse events In adults 60 years and older, c ommon local reactions to influenza vaccines without adjuvant that are injected intramuscularly include redness, swelling, pain, and induration. Local reactions common to vaccines injected intradermally include itchiness, soreness, redness, swelling, pain, and induration. These reactions last 2- 3 days and rarely interfere with normal activities. Systemic reactions common to adults 60 years and older who receive influenza vaccines include headache, mal aise, myalgia, fatigue, art hralgia, and fever. 11 | A REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE OF HIGH DOSE SEASONAL INFLUENZA VACCINE FO R ADULTS 65 YEARS AND OLDER High (>15g HA/s train) versus 60g HA/strain vaccines produce a significantly higher rate of systemic reactions than the 15g HA/strain vaccines to which they were compared. One study reported a higher rate of systemic reaction without specifying the specific reaction32. Other studies reported significantly higher rates of malaise28, myalgia28, 31, and moderate/severe fever28. Rates of systemic reactions in the first 7 days after vaccination include (15g versus 60g, and fever (0.5- 2.3% v s. 0.7-4.4%)28, 29, 31. Rates of local reactions include: (15g versus respectively): pain -29%), and swelling ( 18% v 6-24%)28, 29, 31. Serious adverse ev ents were similar in frequency between the 15- and 60-g HA/strain vaccines. In 25, 440 older adults who received the 60g HA/strain vaccines, 6 (2.36/10,000) vaccine- related serious adverse events were reported including cardiac chest pain21, oculorespiratory syndrome29, cranial nerve VI disseminated encephalomyelitis33, and Crohn' s disease exacerbation28. These events were classified by the study investigators as being vaccine- related. 30g HA/strain Inactivated Intramus cular Influenza Vaccines In the two studies there were no reported differences in the rate of local or systemic reactions for people who received the 15 - or 30- g HA/strain vaccines . There were no reported serious adverse events related to the vaccine among the 80 people who received the 30g HA/strain vaccines30, 37. Recombinant Haemagglutinin Vaccines Reco mbinant subunit influenza vaccines elicited significantly higher rates of injection site pain40 and immediate injection site redness23 than standard dose inactivated influenza vaccines. No serious adverse events were reported in the 730 recipients. High (>9g HA/strain) Dose Intradermal Vaccines 15g HA/strain Intradermal The intradermal administration of influenza vaccines produces significantly higher rates of local reaction including redness, swelling, induration, and prurit us than either of the standard dose inactivated vaccines (i.e. those with and those without adjuvant ) 41-46, 49, 50. Rates of systemic and local reactions non-adjuvanted intramuscular versus 29%)41-43, 46, 50. Four s evere adverse events that may have been related to receipt of the intradermal vaccine were reported in 4815 older adults (8.31/ 10,000) including myopericarditis 46, facial neuralgia46, brachial neuritis42, and pneumonia49. For an overview of contraindications and precautions for influenza vaccines in general, please see the NACI annual statement on seasonal influenza vaccines . 12 | A REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE OF HIGH DOSE SEASONAL INFLUENZA VACCINE FO R ADULTS 65 YEARS AND OLDER IV. EVIDENCE GAPS IV.1 Older Adults with Risk Factors The majority of studies reviewed for this report were conducted with ambulatory, community - dwelling older adults without immune suppressing diseases and who were not using immune suppressing medication. Also, the mean age of the participants is in the early 70s, when the immune response is expected to be better than for older adults . Studies need to be completed in older adults with immune suppressing conditions or using immune suppressing medications, people who are institutionalized, and adults who are 75 years of age and older to determine whether these vaccines are as effective in these cohorts as they are in the younger, healthier cohorts of senior s. IV.2 Types of Vaccines Compared There are no studies, at present, to compare the efficacy or effectiveness of 60g HA/strain inactivated intramuscular influenza vaccine to 15g HA/strain inactivated intradermal vaccine. Since these vaccines are manufactured specifically for use in older adults, a head- to-head comparison woul d be i nformative for decision- makers. On ly on e study compared the immune responses of older adults vaccinated with 60g HA/strain to those vaccinated with 15g HA/strain intradermal vaccine and none have compared the the 60g HA/strain product to 15g HA/strain intramuscular influenza vaccine containing an adjuvant. There ar e also no studies that compare any of these vaccines with the quadrivalent influenza vaccines. Although a previous review found similar immune responses and safety profiles for inactivated quadrivalent compared with inactivated trivalent influ enza vaccines in older adults , no studies have assessed the efficacy or effectiveness of the quadrivalent vaccines in seniors . V. DISCUSSION/SUMMARY In one large randomized controlled trial, people 65 years and older who received Fluzone\u00ae High Dose were 18 -24% less likely to have laboratory -confirmed influenza than people who received Fluzone\u00ae (standard dose) 33. The high dose vaccine was shown to have significantly higher rates of seroconversion and seroprotection than its 15g HA/strain standard dose counterpart. The post -vaccination geometric mean titres of people receiving the high dose vaccine was about 1.5- 1.8 times higher than those receiving the st andard dose vaccine, indicating higher relative antibody immune response 28 days after vaccination. The high dose vaccine does, however, induce higher rates of reaction post -injection but they were short -lived. Intanza\u00ae (15g HA/strain), which was produced for adults 60 years and older, was shown in one retrospective cohort study to reduce influenza- related hospitalization by 33% compared to the standard dose virosomal subunit trivalent influenza vaccine in community -dwelling adults 65 years and older 25. Compared with standard dose intramuscular influenza vaccines, the rates of seroconversion and seroprotection are slightly higher in those r eceiving Intanza\u00ae . The post - vaccination geometric mean titr es of people receiving Intanza\u00ae is about 1.3 times higher than those receiving the standard dose intramuscular vaccine. In comparison, people vaccinated with Intanza\u00ae (15g HA/strain) had lower serological responses than those vaccinated with Fluzone\u00ae High Dose, but similar to those receiving adjuvanted formulations of influenza vaccines . The intradermal vaccine induced higher rates of reactogenicity than the non- adjuvanted intramuscular influenza v accines. 13 | A REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE OF HIGH DOSE SEASONAL INFLUENZA VACCINE FO R ADULTS 65 YEARS AND OLDER VI. CONCLUSIONS Higher dose intramuscular, trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine for older adultsb should provide superior protection compared with the standard dose intramuscular vaccines, but whether it is superior to the currently -available adjuvanted intramuscular formulations is, as -yet, unknown. The higher dose intradermal influenza vaccine indicated for older adults induces higher serological immune responses than the standard dose i ntramuscular vaccines to which it has been compared, similar responses as adjuvanted inactivated influenza vaccines , but lower responses than the high dose intramuscular inactivated influenza vaccine. The intradermal product is no longer available in Canada. Fluzone\u00ae High Dose and Intanza\u00ae (15g) influenza vaccines induce higher rates of post -injection reactions, but these reactions are short -lived. b Fluzone High-Dose\u00ae was authorized for use in Canada in the Autumn of 2015. 14 | A REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE OF HIGH DOSE SEASONAL INFLUENZA VACCINE FO R ADULTS 65 YEARS AND OLDER VII. UPDATE TO THE REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE Although anticipated, an intramuscular high dose seasonal influenza vaccine was not available on the market in Canada at the completion of the initial literature review . An update was conducted to ensure recommendations for the use of such a vaccine would be informed by a body of evidence that included the most current literature. The initial search strategy was replicated in Medline and EMBASE for literature indexed between June 27, 2014 and June 22, 2015. With the intradermal vaccine (Intanza\u00ae) no longer offered in Canada , studies using intradermal influenza vaccine as the high dose comparator were excluded. The search yielded 1,003 non- duplicate records , with 73 articles undergoing full -text review . The review of the search results was conducted by two reviewers. Articles were only excluded if they were assessed as ineligible by both reviewers. If the first and second reviewers could not agree on the article's eligibility, the article was assessed by a third reviewer. Titles and abstracts , and full-text articles were screened for relevance and reasons for exclusion were the same as the initial review by two reviewers (see Methods section). Also excluded were articles that had previously been included in the review. Two articles were subsequently selected for inclusion and were assessed for level of evidence (Appendix C, Table 1) and the quality of the study (Appendix C, Table 2) . Appendix D contains extracted information on efficacy and effectiveness, and Appendix E on immunogenicity. One study compared the relative e fficacy of high dose vaccine and one assessed immunogenicity. Both are described below. Izurieta et al. (2015) evaluated the relative efficacy of a high dose influenza vaccine [ Fluzone\u00ae High Dose (60g HA/strain) ] and any standard dose influenza vaccine ( 15g HA/strain) administered during the 2012- 13 influenza season against probable influenza- related illness (community medical encounter with a rapid influenza diagnostic test and dispensing of oseltamivir) , and hospital -in patient admission or emergency department visit with an influenza diagnosis 62. The study participants included 2,545,275 community -based adults 65 years and older who were enrolled in Medicare in the United States . Fewer events were observed in recipients of the high dose vaccine for both outcomes and t he relative efficacy was 22% in favour of the high dose vaccine for both outcomes (95% CI: 15, 29 for probable influenza- related illness, and 95% CI: 16, 27 for hospitalization or emergency department visit). Relative efficacy for probable influenza -related illness increased to 36% (95% CI: 13, 54) in those 85 years and older. Measures of immunogenicity were assessed i n a study by Nace et al. (2015) comparing high dose influenza vaccine [Fluzone\u00ae High Dose (60g HA/strain) ] and a standard dose influenza vaccine ( 15g HA/strain) in 187 frail adults 65 years and older residing in long- term care facilities over two influenza seasons (2011 -12, 2012- 13)63. While comparable at baseline, at Day 30, GMTs were significantly higher in recipients of t he high dose vaccine during both seasons, except for H1N1 in 2012- 13 and seroprotection was significantly higher for H3N2 and B during both seasons. At Day 180, GMTs were only significantly higher for H3N2 and seroprotection was only higher for H1N1 and H3 N2, during the 2011- 12 season in high dose vaccine recipients. 15 | A REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE OF HIGH DOSE SEASONAL INFLUENZA VACCINE FO R ADULTS 65 YEARS AND OLDER These two studies further support the conclusion of the original review that higher dose intramuscular, trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine for older adults should provide superior protec tion compared with the standard dose intramuscular vaccine. Izurieta et al (2015) demonstrates that this superior relative protection in older adults is enhanced in those 85 years and older. Nace et al. (2015) was also the first study to look at the use o f high dose intramuscular influenza vaccine in a population of frail older adults, and begins to address an identified evidence gap. However, there continues to be a need for studies of high dose intramuscular trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine in hig h risk patients of all ages and for head- to-head trials of high dose intramuscular influenza vaccine, adjuvanted influenza vaccine, and the quadrivalent influenza vaccine. 16 | A REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE OF HIGH DOSE SEASONAL INFLUENZA VACCINE FO R ADULTS 65 YEARS AND OLDER VIII.

II-1 Evidence from controlled trial(s) without randomization. II-2 Evidence from cohort or case -control analytic studies, preferably from more than one centre or research group using clinical outcome measures of vaccine efficacy. II-3 Evidence obtained from multiple time series with or without the intervention. Dramatic results in uncontrolled experiments (such as the results of the introduction of penicillin treatment in the 1940s) could also be regarded as this type of evidence. III Opinions of respected authorities, based on clinical experience, descriptive studies and case reports, or reports of expert committees. Table 2: Definition of overall study quality Good A study (including meta -analyses or systematic reviews) that meets all design - specific criteria* well. Fair A study (including meta -analyses or systematic reviews) that does not meet (or it is not clear that it meets) at least one design -specific criterion but has no known \"fatal flaw\". Poor A study (including meta -analyses or systematic reviews) that has at least one design - specific \"fatal flaw\", or an accumulation of lesser flaws to the extent that the results of the study are not deemed able to inform recommendations. *General design specific cri teria are outlined in Harris et al., 20011. 27 | A REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE OF HIGH DOSE SE ASONAL INFLUENZA VAC CINE FOR ADULTS 65 YEARS AND OLDER Appendix D: Summary of evidence related to efficacy/effectiveness of high dose influenza vaccines in adults 65 years and older STUDY DETAILS SUMMARY Study Vaccine Study Design Participants Summary of Key Findings Level of Evidence Quality Phase 3b Country USA 99 centres Year 2009- 10 Age 65 yrs Mean 72.8 season Ambulatory, medically stable Excluded Bed-ridden, Immune suppressing disease Follow up : 7 months, during 2009pdm Outcome: ILI with lab- confirmed NP swab PCR -confirmed influenza (any subtype) Attack rates (per protocol) 15 v 60g 2.66/1000 v Relative vaccine 15g participants received the H1N1 2009pdm vaccine respectively ILI defined as: 1 of temperature >37.2oC, feverishness, chills, tiredness, headaches or myalgia; and 1 of nasal congestion, rhinorrhoea, sore throat, cough, sputum production, wheezing, chest tightness, shortness of breath, or chest pain with breathing Level 1 Good Diaz Granados (2014)33 Phase 3b -4 Country USA, Canada 126 centres Year 2011 -12 Age 65 yrs Mean: 30 Outcome: ILI with lab-confirmed NP swab Lab-confirmed influenza Attack rates: (any subtype) 15 v 60g ILI 1.9 v 1.4% ARI 2.4 v 2.0% Relative efficacy 60g:15g Level 1 Good 28 | A REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE OF HIGH DOSE SE ASONAL INFLUENZA VAC CINE FOR ADULTS 65 B/Texas/6/2011 & 2012 -13 24.2% (9.7,36.5)S ARI 18.3% (5.0,29.8) Notes: ILI: 1 of sore throat, cough, sputum production, wheezing, or difficulty breathing and 1 of temperature >37.2oC, chills, tiredness, headaches, or myalgia ARI: sneezing, nasal congestion, rhinorrhoea, sore throat, cough, cohort Country USA Year: 2012- 2013 Community based adults, 65 years of age N=2,545,275 60\u00b5g=929,730 15\u00b5g=1,615,545 Participants had to meet Medicare enrollment, duration and survival criteria, and have received vaccine from a community pharmacy that vaccinated at least one other beneficiary with the alternative vaccine within two weeks of index Primary outc ome: Probable episode of influenza -
