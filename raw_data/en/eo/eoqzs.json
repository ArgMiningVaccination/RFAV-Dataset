When there are pests in an eCe facility, many people try to get rid of them as quickly as possible by using pesticides; for instance, spraying pesticides in the building and outdoor areas to get rid of ants. However, pesticides may cause harm to children, staff and the environment. the harm caused by pesticides may be worse than the harm caused by the pests. More than one billion pounds of pesticides are used every year in the u.s.2In California almost half are used in urban and residential areas, and pesticide residues can be found where people work, live and go to school. Some of the health effects caused by pesticides may include: uImmediate illness, such as poisoning, asthma and flu-like symptoms. ulong-term developmental and health problems in children, and health problems in eCe staff. C u r r i c u l u m O v e r v i e w This curriculum will help you create a healthy and safe ECE environment and provide information on: uThe California Healthy Schools Act uWhy children are at higher risk for pesticide exposure and poisoning uHow to use IPM to w keep pests out. w manage pest problems. w use least-harmful practices. w eliminate use of the most toxic pesticides. 1 Bradman, A. , Dobson, C., Leonard, V. & Messenger, B.

IPM targets the conditions in your facility that allow pests to become a problem rather than simply treating the symptoms (pests). Therefore, IPM: uis more effective at eliminating pests. uprevents pest infestations in the future. uis less likely to cause harm to children, staff and the environment. ucan save time, money and energy. uwill lead to fewer pest problems. uis encouraged in California by the Healthy Schools Act (see page 5). ureduces short and long-term health problems associated with pesticide use.

Positive identification will help you to determine the best plan of action. for example, do you have norway rats or roof rats? they must be dealt with differently. ulearn the signs of their presence such as droppings or damage, even when pests are out of sight. uIdentify pests' characteristics and habits: what are their food, water and shelter needs and what is their life cycle? x M o n I t o r I n g look for signs of pests in the buildings and grounds to: uidentify pest problems early. udetermine if and when treatment is needed. udetermine whether current strategies are working. y M a n a g e M e n t If pests become a problem, you will need to dosomething to manage or suppress them. uuse materials and practices that maximize effectiveness, safety and reduce pesticide exposure to children and staff. uoften you can manage pests with nonchemical steps. uIf you use pesticides, choose least harmful pesticides such as bait stations or gels. Combine them with preventive practices so pests won't come back.I n t e g r a t e d P e s t M a n a g e M e n t : a C u r r I C u l u M f o r e a r l y C a r e a n d e d u C a t I o n P r o g r a M s WHAT IS INTEGRATED PEST MANAGEMENT (IPM)? IPM is a common-sense approach to managing pests while reducing the use of harmful pesticides. IPM programs focus on preventing pest problems by getting rid of the food, water and shelter that pests need to survive. When pest management is needed, IPM uses a combination of common-sense, least harmful practices. IPM works because combined (integrated) approaches for pest management are more effective in the end than a single approach, like spraying pesticides. IPM in a facility is always a team effort between the program staff, janitorial staff, parents, and the building manager, landlord and pest management professional. everyone has a role to play and must communicate and cooperate. \u00a9 2011 uCsf California Childcare Health Program 3What to do if you see cockroaches Before you develop a plan to get rid of the cockroaches, ask yourself: are there nearby tenants who should be involved? Consider your building's location, neighbors and ownership. are you in a separate building or shared space? are you renting or leasing? If you focus on only your part of the building, the cockroaches may move away for a short time and return later. If you have cock- roaches, your neighborsprobably do too. If you're renting or leasing space, the landlord or building owner should work with all tenants in your building. What to do in an emergency If you discover cockroaches behind a large appliance, such as a refrigerator, do not spray! Work with another staff person and get a canister vacuum cleaner and hair dryer. one person will use the hair dryer to flush out the cockroaches and the other person will vacuum them up with the canister vacuum cleaner. vacuum their hiding place twice, five minutes apart. during the first pass the cockroaches will scatter. they'll resettle by the time you vacuum again. Then use the steps described on the right. If you want to hire an expert, hire a Pest Management Professional (PMP) who is knowledgeable about IPM (see page 28, How to Hire a PMP). for more information on specific pests, see the CCHP Health and Safety Notes. a list of these Notes is available in the Appendix. d o uFind out where the cockroaches are coming from; for example, by setting and monitoring sticky traps next to the walls behind cabinets and in corners near food and water sources. vSeal cracks and crevices, gaps around pipes, and other areas to reduce hiding and breeding places and to keep them out of the building. Also, inspect packages and boxes for othersources of cockroaches. wRoutinely clean up food residues so cockroaches don't have food. Keep food in sealed containers. Fix leaky faucets so cockroaches don't have water. xKeep garbage in lined, covered containers. yEliminate clutter. Take supplies out of boxesand store in cupboards or open metal shelving. zPut out sticky traps to find out early if roaches return. {Use bait stations or gels for managing existing roach problems. d o n ' t |Don't react immediately by spraying, putting out poison, or using foggers. These methods can be dangerous. If you can't handle the problem yourself, hire a PMP who practices IPM. Remember, unless you are only using baits or gels which are exempt from the requirements of the Healthy Schools Act, you need to notify concerned staff and parents when you apply a pesticide. Note - not everybody needs to be notified, just those who requested notification.W H a t I s I n t e g r a t e d P e s t M a n a g e M e n t ( I P M ) ?

Hsa also requires the department of Pesticide regulation to collect information on pesticide use in child care centers. What does the law require? uNotification. every year, each eCe center must provide written information for parents and staff that: w describes which pesticides it expects center staff or a PMP to apply in the upcoming year. w provides the Internet address to DPR's School IPM Program website: apps.cdpr.ca.gov/schoolipm uRegistry. each eCe center must maintain a voluntary registry of parents and staff who choose to be notified before a nonexempt pesticide (e.g. spray or fogger) is used in the center. the Hsa regulates the use of \"nonexempt\"pesticide application methods in child care settings; that is, broadcast methods such as spray or fogger applications. the use of pesticides contained in baits, gels, or traps are exempt from the law. uNotice of Pesticide Applications. those who enroll in the registry must be notified of nonexempt individual pesticide applications at least 72 hours before the application. the notice should include the name of the pesticide, active ingredient(s) in the product, and date the pesticide will be applied (see Sample Notification Letter in the Appendix). uWarning Signs. every eCe center must post warning signs around each area where nonexempt pesticides will be applied. these signs should be in place 24 hours before and stay in place 72 hours after pesticides are used. these signs should be large enough to prevent any adult from accidentally entering areas where pesticides have been used. see Sample Warning Sign in the Appendix. uRecord Keeping. every eCe center must keep records of which pesticides have been used in the past four years. the records must be available to anyone who asks to see them. uPesticide Prohibition. some pesticides are never allowed to be used in eCe centers. for a list of these pesticides, see the link under Resources, AB 405 List of Pesticide Products Prohibited from Use in Schools. apps.cdpr.ca.gov/schoolipm/school_ ipm_law/prohibited_prods.pdfIn 2007, California law aB 2865 extended the Healthy schools act to child care centers. the Healthy schools act now applies to all K-12 schools as well as public and private child care centers, but not to family child care homes. The Healthy Schools Act applies to some pesticides, like sprays and foggers. \u00a9 2011 uCsf California Childcare Health Program 5t H e H e a l t H y s C H o o l s a C t uProperty Owners. If the owner of a property where a child care center is located uses pesticides, they must provide written notice to the eCe center at least 120 hours before they apply a pesticide. uInformation. the department of Pesticide regulation (dPr) must provide information to eCe programs on the least harmful practices for getting rid of pests, such as this IPM toolkit. licensed pest management businesses must report yearly to dPr on pesticide applications they make to eCe centers. If a child care center hires a Pest Management Professional (PMP), thePMP must notify the center 120 hours before applying nonexempt pesticides. In California, PMPs are usually called Pest Control operators or exterminators. uNotification Responsibilities of PropertyOwners. If a property owner hires a PMP , then the property owner must notify the PMP that a child care facility is present on the property. the PMP then must follow notification requirementsrequired by the Healthy schools act.uECE Responsibilities to a PMP. the child care staff must inform the PMP that the facility must comply with the Healthy schools act. the Healthy schools act regulates the use of pesticides on center buildings or structures, playgrounds, lawns, vehicles, or any other area of the property visited or used by children. the Healthy schools act applies to pesticides that are in the form of: w sprays. w foggers. w Pellets or powder, if uncontained. these pesticides are referred to as nonexempt in the Healthy schools act. Exempt Pesticides Products that use pesticides in a bait, trap, or gel or are used to kill germs (antimicrobials), such as sanitizers and disinfectants, are exempt (not covered by the law). this means that parents and staff do not need to be notified when these pesticide products are used, and records do not have to be kept of their application. for more information on exempt pesticides, see the dPr publication Pesticides Exempt from the School Posting, Notification, and Record Keeping Requirements of the Healthy Schools Act of 2000 (HSA) available online at: apps.cdpr.ca.gov/schoolipm/school_ipm_law/26_ exempt_text5.pdf Who is responsible for helping to implement the Healthy Schools Act? dPr is responsible for helping schools and child care centers implement IPM practices. you may request information from dPr about starting an IPM program in an eCe facility by contacting dPr's growing up green Program.

Pests can be animals, plants or bacteria. a pest can also be something that is simply where it is not wanted, such as clover in a grass play area. rats, mice, cockroaches, house flies, raccoons, squirrels, ants, weeds and bacteria are all examples of different types of pests. Make sure something is really a pest before you remove it.H a z a r d s o f p e s t s f o r y o u n g c h i l d r e n some pests are merely annoying, but others can cause serious harm to children. for example: urodents, such as rats and mice, can contaminate food, food preparation areas and other surfaces with their urine, feces and stray hairs. they carry diseases or fleas into areas where people are present. they can also trigger asthma. uCockroaches are a common trigger of asthma and can carry diseases. ustinging pests, such as yellowjackets, hornets and some ants and bees, can cause severe reactions that can be life threatening for some people. uflies can spread disease when they walk on food.I n t e g r a t e d P e s t M a n a g e M e n t : a C u r r I C u l u M f o r e a r l y C a r e a n d e d u C a t I o n P r o g r a M s PESTS - WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW Most Common Pests in Child Care Centers Raccoon Squirrel Rat Cockroach Spider Ant Mosquito Lice House Fly Yellowjacket \u00a9 2011 uCsf California Childcare Health Program 7W h a t a r e p e s t i c i d e s ? a pesticide is a poison that is designed to kill or control living things such as weeds, bugs, spiders or anything that you do not want to live in your child care facility or yard. roach and ant spray, flea bombs, rat poison, weed killer or mothballs are all examples of pesticides. all pesticides are potentially harmful. Pesticides should be used as a last resort. Pesticide sprays and foggers are especially harmful and should be avoided in child care programs. W h a t t y p e s o f p e s t i c i d e s a r e t h e r e ? there are many types and trade names of pesticides that are marketed to kill specific pests. for example, an herbicide, which kills weeds, is a pesticide. Here is a list of pesticides and the type of pests they are designed to kill.W h e r e a r e p e s t i c i d e s u s e d ? Pesticides are often used outside, such as on lawns and in gardens. they are also commonly used in and around buildings such as homes and classrooms. uIndoor levels of pesticides may be higher than outdoor levels because pesticides settle into carpets and on other inside surfaces, and build up in dust. Pesticides used indoors, or tracked inside on shoes, can remain for weeks, months or even years. WHAT ARE THE HEALTH HAZARDS? even though pesticides are registered with the u.s. ePa, they can still be dangerous to children and adults. typically, the harmful effects of a pesticide depend on: uhow poisonous the pesticide is. some are more poisonous than others. uhow long a person is in contact with the pesticide (this is called exposure) . uhow much of the pesticide gets inside the body of the person exposed. uhow a person comes into contact with the pesticide. Pesticides can be swallowed, breathed in through the lungs or absorbed through the skin. Exposure to some pesticides can cause acute poisoning or acute health effects. In 2008, united states (us) Poison Control Centers reported 43,526 cases of possible pesticide poisoning in children younger than six.3the signs of acute, sudden pesticide-related sickness that happen soon after exposure can be mistaken for the flu or other illnesses. see the table Acute and Chronic Health Effects on page 9 for more information.I n t e g r a t e d P e s t M a n a g e M e n t : a C u r r I C u l u M f o r e a r l y C a r e a n d e d u C a t I o n P r o g r a M s PESTICIDES - WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW PESTICIDE PEST 1.

Some of the acute and chronic health effects of pesticides are: ACUTE HEALTH EFFECTS (SUDDEN EXPOSURE) uCough or difficulty breathing uNausea or vomiting uStomach pain uDiarrhea uHeadache uBlurred vision or irritated eyes uDizziness uRash or other skin irritation uConfusion POSSIBLE LONG-TERM HEALTH EFFECTS uAsthma uLow birth weight uBirth defects uGenetic uCancers uHormonal changes (disruption of the endocrine system)Children are more vulnerable to pesticides in their environment than adults because they: ueat and drink more per pound of body weight than adults.

P e s t I C I d e s - W H a t y o u n e e d t o K n o W O t h e r h a z a r d s o f u s i n g p e s t i c i d e s Pesticides are poisonous to pests, but they are also poisonous to people, animals and the environment. Pesticides enter the environment through water and air. Pesticides can enter storm drains, seep through the ground or run off of sidewalks or soil into streams and lakes that provide drinking water to humans and animals. Pesticides can also sometimes make pest problems worse. uover time, pests often become resistant to pesticides so the pesticides stop working, and stronger ones are needed to manage pest problems. uWhile pesticides kill pests, they can also kill valuable insects, such as predators that keep pests in check. C h o o s i n g s a f e r p e s t i c i d e p r o d u c t s IPM practices that don't use any pesticides at all are often effective and eliminate pest problems. If nonchemical approaches are not effective by themselves, you may need to use pesticides. Here are the key points about choosing a safer pesticide product: Use pesticides that are exempt from the Healthy Schools Act requirements Products that are exempt from reporting under the Healthy schools act such as baits and gels have all been determined to be safer for use around children than other pesticide products. they are safer either because they have very low toxicity or are used in a form, such as a bait station, that makes them lesshazardous because there's reduced risk of exposure to the pesticides. exempt products should be used andstored out of children's reach.for more information on choosing safer pesticides for individual pests, review the CCHP Health & Safety Notes included in this Toolkit on individual pests common in eCe programs. these CCHP Health and Safety Notes provide information about nonchemical and safer options appropriate for individual pests that should be tried before resorting to nonexempt pesticides. these CCHP Health and Safety Notes can also be found on CCHP's website: www.ucsfchildcarehealth.org/html/pandr/ hsnotesmain.htm Use pesticides registered for use by the EPA and DPR except for a few products that are made from food- grade substances, all pesticides must be registered by the u.s. ePa and the California department of Pesticide regulation (dPr) to be sold or used in California. Be sure you only use registered products. some unregistered products that are illegal in California are very dangerous. examples of illegal pesticides that are highly toxic and dangerous to use: uNaphthalene moth repellents are made from naphthalene and are white or colorful balls that look like candy or toys to children. uIllegal insecticide chalk (ant and cockroach chalk), also called Miraculous Chalk or Chinese Chalk, is usually imported from China and is not expensive. It looks like simple blackboard chalk. uTres Pasitos is a colorful pesticide that looks like candy. It is used to kill rats. Illegal insecticide chalk. 10P e s t I C I d e s - W H a t y o u n e e d t o K n o W Use caution when choosing organic, green or natural products Choosing safer pesticide products can be hard because there is a lot of conflicting information available on the Internet and in the media. some pesticides are advertised as organic, green ornatural to make them seem safer than traditional pesticides, but some may also have significant hazards, especially if the directions on the label are not followed. the terms green or natural should be viewed with suspicion. of the terms green, natural and organic, only the term organic has an official definition. Use pesticides registered for use by the EPA and DPR Organic pesticides: umust be derived from natural sources, such as plants, animals, microorganisms or minerals. ucannot be synthesized using chemical reactions. ucan have adverse effects on people, animals and the environment even though many of these products may be less toxic than conventional chemical pesticides. an example is the insecticide pyrethrin, which is made from chrysanthemum daisies. It is organic because it only comes from plants, yet pyrethrins are very toxic to fish, and can cause allergic reactions in people. ucan cause problems if used in areas with poor ventilation. some organic sprays are made with essential oils and may smell good at first, but they can cause children and staff to cough or suffer eye irritation and trigger asthma. for example, thymeoil can irritate the skin, eyes and lungs and cause allergic reactions. Pesticides, including organic or so-called green pesticides, should only be used as a last resort. try alternate ways to get rid of pests and resist usingsprays even if they are labeled organic or green products.Use safer products to protect against bacteria and viruses the prevention of diseases caused by bacteria and viruses is a priority in eCe settings. California Community Care licensing requires that certain surfaces in eCe settings be sanitized or disinfected. sanitizing and disinfecting (antimicrobial) products that kill bacteria and viruses are pesticides. all products used to sanitize or disinfect must be registered by the ePa. Bleach is the most commonly used product for sanitizing and disinfecting in eCe. It has a short killing time and it does not need to be rinsed since it breaks down quickly. But there are increasing concerns about the health effects of bleach, particularly for children with asthma. Many eCe providers are looking for alternatives to bleach for sanitizing. the ePa's design for the environment (dfe) antimicrobial Pesticide Pilot Project is a new program that identifies disinfectants that are at the safer end of the disinfectant spectrum. dfe scientists have screened disinfectant ingredients for potential human health and environmental effects. they have identified the following as least-toxic active ingredients in disinfectants: ustabilized hydrogen peroxide ulactic acid uCitric acid Products containing these ingredients that pass the dfe tests for safety and efficacy will be listed on their website, www.epa.gov/dfe/. If you see the dfe logo on an ePa-authorized antimicrobial pesticide label, you can be assured that, based on the best currently available information, the product contains only ingredients that pose the least health and environmental concerns. using sanitizing/disinfecting products with the dfe logo can protect the health of children and staff as well as the environment. for more information, see the CCHP Health and safety notes,Green Cleaning and Sanitizing Safely and Effectively. also see the resources section on page 31. \u00a9 2011 uCsf California Childcare Health Program 11I n t e g r a t e d P e s t M a n a g e M e n t : a C u r r I C u l u M f o r e a r l y C a r e a n d e d u C a t I o n P r o g r a M s UNDERSTANDING IPM PRACTICES In this section, we provide more detail about IPM. IPM is typically described in five categories: In practice, many of the strategies we describe below are used in more than one category of IPM. P R E V E N T I O N Prevention is always the preferred way to manage pests in an IPM program. Many pests are attracted to food and water, and find shelter and hiding spots in cracks and crevices or cluttered places. taking steps to keep pests from getting into your eCe facility is important and can be done by following the strategies in this section (see also the IPM Checklist in the IPM Toolkit).

Landscape Many pests that come indoors and bother children and staff originate in outdoor areas. these include ants, yellowjackets, flies, mosquitoes, spiders, mice and rats. you can reduce their numbers by maintaining a landscape that does not allow them to thrive or invade indoor spaces: uKeep plants, mulch and moisture at least 12 inches away from the building. u Trim branches regularly and keep them at least 3-4 feet from the building. uremove ivy, vines, wood, debris, garden produce, compost piles and thick mulch around the perimeter of building. uClean gutters. uPlant flowers that don't attract bees, such as zinnias. u n d e r s t a n d I n g I P M P r a C t I C e s \u00a9 2011 uCsf California Childcare Health ProgramA clogged gutter can become a home for pests and prevents proper drainage away from the building. Openings are entrances for pests. Screen vents or other large openings with hardware cloth. 13remember that a pest in one situation may not be a pest in another. evaluate carefully whether something is, in fact, a pest before looking for ways to get rid of it. for example, many people dislike sowbugs or pillbugs, yet they do little harm in the landscape; and a few snails or slugs are not pests if they are not bothering your plants.

Fix leaky plumbing.Storage, shelter and hiding places Pests love clutter. It gives cockroaches and mice a place to breed and hide. Pests also thrive where they have hiding places such as cracks, crevices, wall voids, spaces behind pictures or hanging art work, gaps behind molding and spaces between furniture and walls. Where possible, eliminate these hiding places by caulking, covering gaps with screens or filling holes and voids with copper wool. In places where eliminating hiding places is not possible, clean regularly and monitor for the presence of pests. If you have pets on-site remember to properly store their food and water. also keep earthquake supplies properly stored so that pests cannot get into them. To minimize the level of clutter: uorganize equipment and toys. uclean regularly. uavoid storing stacks of newspapers, magazines or cardboard boxes because these provide an excellent shelter for roaches, rodents and other pests. If you need to store items, use plastic bins with sealed lids. Common pests that like clutter include cockroaches, spiders, mice and rats. for specific pest prevention strategies for individual pests, see the CCHP Health and Safety Notes included in this IPM Toolkit or online at: www.ucsfchildcarehealth.org/html/pandr/ hsnotesmain.htm for information on pest prevention strategies for birds, termites and other potential pests not covered in this Toolkit, see the university of California IPM Program website: www.ipm.ucdavis.edu or www.ipm.ucdavis.edu/PMG/menu.homegarden.html u n d e r s t a n d I n g I P M P r a C t I C e s \u00a9 2011 uCsf California Childcare Health ProgramClutter provides hiding places for roaches, rodents and other pests.

If you don't know which pests are present, you may use the wrong management approach, choose the wrong pesticide, or treat too often or at the wrong time and do more harm than good. ufor help identifying pests, see the CCHP Health and Safety Notes contained in this Toolkit on IPM for individual pests or the University of California Statewide Integrated Pest Management Program Pest Notes, www.ipm.ucdavis.edu/PDF/PESTNOTES/index. html ulearn the signs of pests' presence such as droppings or damage caused by gnawing or chewing, even when pests are out of sight. uMake sure that you correctly identify somethingas a pest that requires action. Most insects are not pests .Identify pests' characteristics and habits uAccess: How do they get inside? do they enter the building on cardboard boxes or in food? uFood: What foods do they eat? uWater: What are their sources of water? uShelter: Where do they hide? w do they burrow or find their way into existing cracks and holes? uDamage: What damage do they cause? u Life cycle of pests: w How long does it take them to grow to adulthood and reproduce? w at what stage of their life cycle do they cause the most problems? w How fast do they reproduce?u n d e r s t a n d I n g I P M P r a C t I C e s Norway rat roof rat house mouse Identify which types of pests are present in and around your facility. 20u n d e r s t a n d I n g I P M P r a C t I C e s M O N I T O R I N G If you successfully prevent pests or eliminate them from your facility, your IPM efforts aren't over! Monitoring for pests is an ongoing process that is very important in an IPM program. Monitoring involves systematic inspections that you conduct at regular intervals to identify pest problems early when management is easiest. Monitoring helps you identify how serious your pest problems are and where they are located. Monitoring pests involves: uregularly inspecting the facility for pests and pest damage. uidentifying sources of food and water that could attract pests. uassessing the effects of your pest management strategies. STEPS OF EFFECTIVE MONITORING uDecide who will do the monitoring. vChoose effective tools, including: umonitoring traps (for example, sticky traps for monitoring many insects); check them regularly. uflashlight with a halogen bulb; get into a squatting position to check under cabinets and furniture for signs of pests. usmall knife or screwdriver to collect pest droppings or probe wood for dry rot. ucamera to document pest damage to plants or structures before and after IPM practices have been used (optional).wKeep good written records each time you do a visual inspection (see the IPM Checklist in the Toolkit andPest Monitoring Form on page 39). Make sure these include: udate and time the inspection took place. uwhich pests were present, where they were present, how many and their stage of growth. uevidence of pest damage and where seen. uwhen pesticides such as gels or pastes were last used. Keeping good records will: ugive you information for your pest management decisions. umake sure that information is documented and not lost when employees leave the program. uallow for the evaluation of pest management from year to year. Check under cabinets and furniture for signs of pests. \u00a9 2011 uCsf California Childcare Health Program 21u n d e r s t a n d I n g I P M P r a C t I C e s M A N A G E M E N T If pests become a problem, you will need to manage or suppress them. IPM encourages use of materials and practices for managing pests that maximize safety and reduce exposure of children and staff to harmful chemicals. to manage pests in an IPM program, choose practices that are: uleast harmful to human health and to other non- pest organisms. umost likely to be permanent and prevent the pest problem from coming back. ueasiest to carry out safely and effectively. umost cost-effective in the short and long-term. umatched to the particular pest and coincide with the stage of the pest's life cycle when the pest is most vulnerable. Often you can manage pests with nonchemical steps such as: ukeeping pests out and eliminating their food, water and shelter. uwashing the area with soap and water. uusing a vacuum to remove them: w a high efficiency particulate air (HePa) vacuum with a filter fine enough to screen out insect feces and insect parts. uusing traps: w Place traps out of children's reach, such as in closets or locked cupboards, or in outdoor areas that are inaccessible to children. w some traps are used mainly for monitoring pest presence. these include cockroach traps and various pheromone (insect sex attractant) traps, although if the infestation is small, thesetraps can sometimes be used to manage thepest. w other nonchemical traps include: \" snap traps for mice and rats, properlyplaced where rodents will find them.\"flypaper and ultraviolet light traps for flies. \"cone traps for yellowjackets or flies. \"box traps for skunks, raccoons and opossum. If nonchemical steps don't work, use the least- harmful pesticides to manage a pest problem. Least-harmful pesticides are: w contained in bait stations (not sprayed or broadcast.) w effective against thetarget pest. w have a lowacute and chronictoxicity to people, animals and the environment. w biodegrade rapidly. w kill a narrow range of target pests. w have little or no impact on other organisms, especially the pest's predators.Place traps out of children's reach. 22 u n d e r s t a n d I n g I P M P r a C t I C e s these are examples of least-hazardous pesticides registered in California. uBaits are pesticides mixed with materials that attract pests looking for food. they are a key tool for managing ants (worker ants carry small portions of the bait back to the nest where it is transferred to ants in the colony, eventually killing the entire colony). ant bait products must be slow-acting so that the foraging ants have time to make their way back to the nest and feed other members of the colony before they are killed. When properly used, baits are more effective and safer than sprays. ant baits are available in prepackaged containerized bait stations or as products that can be placed in refillable bait stations or dispensers. uBorates for use in bait stations for ants or cockroaches. uDesiccating dusts are powders that kill insects by drying out their waxy coating, causing them to die of dehydration. they do not act by poisoning the nervous systems of pests. they are often applied behind wall voids, under light switches and other hard-to-reach places pests like to hide. examples are diatomaceous earth and silica gel. uGels are another form of bait. they are insecticides mixed with materials that attract pests. Instead of being placed in bait stations, gels are squeezed into cracks and crevices where pests commonly hide using a syringe type applicator. uInsect growth regulators (IGRs) interfere with insect growth. uPesticidal soaps and oils also act by suffocating insects, usually those attacking plant surfaces. these come in liquid and spray forms and would not commonly be used for structural (indoor) pests. uPheromones and other attractants prevent mating. uRepellents send pests somewhere else.uSome botanical pesticides which are derived from plants. However, this does not mean they are \"safe.\" they can be as diverse as all other pesticides and must be chosen on a case-by-case basis. (see section Use caution when choosing organic, green, or natural products, on page 11.) When choosing a pesticide, it's a good idea to obtain a Material safety data sheet (Msds) for the product. these documents contain information on potential hazards and safety precautions for a product. Msds forms are available online and from pesticide suppliers. Keep the Msds with your IPM records. DPR's School HELPR Web page is a guide to choosing the best pest management action, depending on the situation. you can access it online at: apps.cdpr.ca.gov/schoolipm/health_issues/main .cfm?#usehelper this guide can also help you choose baits that contain less harmful pesticides. use pesticides only when and where needed; for example, it is rarely necessary to treat an entire building or landscape area to solve a pest problem. If you use pesticides, combine them with preventive practices so pests won't come back. determine the causes of pest problems, and develop a pest management plan to address these causes with primarily nonchemical solutions. SAFE STORAGE AND DISPOSAL OF PESTICIDES all pesticides, including containerized baits, organic or other exempt pesticides and some disinfectants must be stored and disposed of appropriately: u store all pesticides in locked cabinets out of children's reach. u store pesticides in their original containers withcomplete label information. u try not to purchase more pesticide than you'll use in a short time to avoid problems with storage and disposal. u dispose of leftover pesticides at a hazardous waste disposal site. to find the hazardous waste disposal site closest to you check www.earth911.org or call the California environmental Hotline at: 800-253-2687. u If you employ a pest management company, they areresponsible for storage and disposal of extrapesticides. \u00a9 2011 uCsf California Childcare Health Program 23u n d e r s t a n d I n g I P M P r a C t I C e s theproduct or brand name is prominently displayed on the front label.

The following is a quick overview of key things to look for on the label: theEnvironmental Protection Agency Registration number ensures that the pesticide has been reviewed by ePa. thestorage and disposal instructions tell you how to store and dispose of leftover pesticides.thedirections for use tell you where, when and how to use the pesticide safely. follow thesedirections precisely. this section alsotells you what kind of pest this product was designed to kill. theprecautionary statements describe potential harmful effects topeople, animals or the environment. 24for more information on reading a pesticide label, see the ePa \"read the label first\" website: www.epa.gov/pesticides/label/I n t e g r a t e d P e s t M a n a g e M e n t : a C u r r I C u l u M f o r e a r l y C a r e a n d e d u C a t I o n IMPLEMENTING IPM IN YOUR ECE PROGRAM the best way to comply with the Healthy schools act and protect the health of children, staff and the environment is to implement an IPM program. Here are the steps to start your IPM program: uWrite and include an IPM policy in your center's policy manual. (see Sample IPM Policy for Child Care in the Appendix). this policy should: ustate how the eCe center will comply with the Healthy schools act. uidentify how the program will manage pests inside the facility and in outdoor play areas. uestablish a procedure to notify parents and staff if pesticides that are not exempt from the Healthy schools act rules must be used. uidentify minimum qualifications for a Pest Management Professional (PMP) hired to work at your center (see How to Hire a Pest Management Professional on page 28). vDesignate an IPM Coordinator. this person coordinates and leads the day-to-day IPM activities and acts as a liaison with staff, a pest management company (if used), and parents. often, the program director or facility manager acts as the IPM Coordinator. the IPM Coordinator: uassures that staff members report pest sightings using the Pest Monitoring Log (see page 39). ucommunicates recommendations from the PMP for cleaning or repairs to staff and administrators, and confirms that they have been carried out. utakes responsibility for regular monitoring if there isn't a PMP . uassures that the pest management plan for the facility is carried out. uis responsible for storage, safe use and disposal of pesticides.ufacilitates staff training on IPM. udoes not have to be a pest management expert, but should have good organizational skills and an interest in IPM. wProvide training for facility and child care provider staff and parents about your IPM program. IPM is a team effort, requiring cooperation among the director, teachers, custodian, maintenance staff, children and parents. uuse the IPM Toolkit andCCHP Health and Safety Notes to train staff. ufor further information on educating staff and parents, see the DPR Child Care IPM-Growing Up Green website: www.cdpr.ca.gov/schoolipm/childcare. uEducation of staff and parents should focus on how to implement the three steps of pest prevention. these three steps are ongoing tasks that require everyone's participation. wKeep pests out. Make repairs as needed to prevent pests from getting into buildings. wRemove food and water. review sanitation practices. sanitation includes waste disposal and kitchen cleaning. repair leaking pipes and eliminate standing water wherever possible. wRemove shelter.Clutter offers shelter for many pests, especially rodents, spiders and cockroaches. organize clutter and eliminate cardboard. use lidded plastic bins instead, particularly in food areas. seal openings such as gaps commonlybetween equipment and floors. \u00a9 2011 uCsf California Childcare Health Program 25 26I M P l e M e n t I n g I P M I n y o u r e C e P r o g r a M xGet names and contact information for any outside contractors the program uses, such as garbage disposal, building maintenance or pest management professionals. yIf your program requires the services of a PMP,hire one that has IPM experience and knows about the Healthy Schools Act requirements. uPMPs can help maintain a pest-free, pesticide- free facility (see How to Hire a Pest Management Professional on page 28 for more information on interviewing PMPs). zIf you have a pest problem, inspect buildings and grounds for sources of infestations andcontributing conditions. ustaff should know how to look for and remove conditions that increase pest problems . uyour PMP or IPM coordinator will inspect regularly and record evidence of infestations and conditions that contribute to your pest problem. ufollow up on inspection results by fixing conditions that could lead to pest problems such as sealing pest entry points, reducing clutter, improving sanitation and making repairs. {Establish pest monitoring procedures. uregularly carry out all inspections identified in your pest management plan. uWhen needed, place (or ensure that PMP places) monitoring traps in appropriate areas where children and pets cannot find them. ustaff should be instructed not to move or throw away the traps. uMaintenance staff or the IPM Coordinator should monitor traps regularly.ureport pest sightings to the IPM Coordinator. utrack your program's response to pest sightings-when, where and how often. |Identify any pests found. }Create an IPM Action Plan for each pest you find in your environment. Spraying pesticides rarely eliminates pests and isn't a part of an IPM approach except as a last resort when all other strategies haven't been effective. uManagement strategies may include improved sanitation, sealing cracks and moisture leaks, nonchemical management and, if pests are still present, pesticide baits. uthe action plan should state how you will prevent invasions, how you will detect problems and how you will manage them if they occur. you should have a plan for each pest in your environment (see Sample Action Plan for Cockroaches on page 27). for help in making your action plans, see the CCHPHealth and Safety Notes for individual pests. By establishing an action plan for each pest, you'll resist the urge to spray and respond in a safer, more environmentally healthy manner. you'll also be able to demonstrate to your licensing analyst that you are in compliance with the Healthy schools act.

Many PMPs have not had the training or experience required to practice IPM effectively. Below are some questions that can help guide you as you look for a pest control company that can partner with you in starting your IPM program. uIdentify a PMP with experience in ECE facilities . ask colleagues for the names of PMPs who practice IPM and have experience in eCe. Consider hiring only PMPs who have been certified by ecowise, green shield Certified or greenPro. see Resources on page 31 for their websites. vCall a few PMPs and ask specifically if they practice IPM. wAsk what services are included in the PMP's IPM approach. services should include: ua thorough inspection of the facility, indoors and outdoors uwritten recommendations that show ways to prevent pests from entering the facility, or how to exclude pests that have become a problem uperiodic monitoring uuse of traps or least-toxic pesticides when prevention has failed uwritten service reports xConfirm that the PMP understands which services require an ECE director's explicit permission (i.e., application of any pesticides). yAsk whether they use indoor or outdoor sprays as part of their IPM services. routine spraying of pesticides is not part of IPM, except, with your permission, in an emergency situation. somePMPs assume their customers want routine spraying, so make sure your PMP knows you don'twant them to spray.zAsk about the qualifications, experience and training of anyone who will work on your site. all personnel should be trained in IPM practices and must be licensed as PMPs by the state of California. Call dPr for information regarding the status of pest management companies. you can also verify whether a company or an individual has a license issued by the structural Pest Control Board www.pestboard.ca.gov. {Ask for references from the PMP's other clients. |Ways to know if your PMP is NOT using IPM. He/she: udoes not carry a flashlight. uis not responsive or communicative. udoes not use monitoring traps or does not check them. usprays routinely on a regular schedule,whether there arepests present or not. udoes not ask youwhere you have seen pests. udoes not include regular inspections and monitoring as part of the service. udoes not include recommendations for preventive practices such as sealing or sanitation as part of the services.

Allergen. a substance, such as cockroach droppings or pet dander, that can cause an allergic reaction. When the immune systems of sensitive individuals recognize these substances as foreign or dangerous, they may have an allergic reaction. Allergic reaction. an overreaction of the body's defense or immune system to an allergen. allergic reactions can include hives, breathing difficulties, sneezing, itchy and watery eyes, rapid loss of blood pressure or loss of consciousness. Acute toxicity. seeToxicity on page 30. Antimicrobial pesticide. a pesticide used to kill microbial pests such as viruses, bacteria, algae and protozoa. antimicrobials are used to disinfect or sanitize. fungicides are pesticides that target fungal diseases of plants. Asthma trigger. allergens and irritants that can initiate an asthma attack. triggers include pollen, mold, house dust mites and cockroach particles. Beneficial organism. a living thing that provides benefits to humans\u2014for example, an insect that reduces pests by feedingon them (otherwise known as a predator). a ladybeetle reduces pests by feeding on them. Honeybees are also beneficial because they provide honey and help pollinatefoods that we eat. Broadcast. to broadcast a pesticide is to cover a large area with sprays or granules. spot spraying is a more restrictive way to apply a pesticide than broadcast spraying. Chronic toxicity. seeToxicity page 30. Endocrine disruption. Changes or disruption of the endocrine system of humans and wildlife caused by certain chemicals. endocrine disruptors are chemicals that disrupt the endocrine system of humans and wildlife. Exempt pesticide. Certain requirements of the Healthy schools act (record keeping, written notification and posting) do not apply to products used as self-contained baits or traps; gels or pastes used as crack-and-crevice pesticides exempted from regulation by u.s. ePa; or antimicrobial pesticides, including sanitizers and disinfectants. Exempt pesticides by U.S. EPA. under the federal Insecticide, fungicide, and rodenticide act [FIFRA] section 25(b), the u.s. ePa exempts pesticides from registration if they contain certain active ingredients. these are primarily food-grade materials such as mint oil, clove oil and sodium lauryl sulfate (derived from coconut and commonly found in shampoos and detergent). types include: bait stations and sticky traps. Exposure. Contact with a substance through different routes such as the skin or eyes, inhalation or swallowing. FIFRA. the federal Insecticide, fungicide, and rodenticide act is administered by the u.s. ePa and a corresponding agency in each state. (In California, the u.s. ePa equivalent is dPr.) fIfra is the framework from which pesticides are regulated nationally and in every state. Hardware cloth. stiff metal screening often used to seal house vents. It resembles chicken wire, except that the holes of hardware cloth are smaller and square, and the wire used is a thicker gauge. Healthy Schools Act. In January 2001, the Healthy schools act put into place right-to-know requirements such as notification, posting and record keeping for pesticides used at public schools and child care facilities. In January 2007, the law expanded to protect children in private child care facilities. Illegal pesticide. a pesticide that's either not registered in California, or is registered but repackaged. It's best to purchase pesticide products in stores, not at flea markets or on the Internet. avoid using a pesticide that's been stored for a long time. It may have lost its registration, meaning that it's now illegal to use. Inert ingredient. an ingredient in a pesticide product that does not contribute to killing the pest. Inert ingredients can include water, clay and solvents. Infestation. the presence of pests such as rodents or cockroaches. sometimes the pests themselves cannot be seen, but you'll notice the damage they cause (e.g., gnawing) or evidence they've left (e.g., droppings). High Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) vacuum cleaner. a special vacuum cleaner that can remove very small particles from floors, window sills and carpets. \u00a9 2011 uCsf California Childcare Health Program 29g l o s s a r y Life cycle. the different stages of growth and development of a living organism. Individual life stages may be spent in different environments or feeding on different resources. for example, immature mosquitoes live in water and feed on bacteria and algae, while adult female mosquitoes fly around looking for blood. Knowing this about mosquitoes can help you focus on managing the immatures so very few of them develop into adults. understanding the life cycle of a pest will help you develop an effective management strategy. Material safety data sheet (MSDS). a form that contains information about the properties of a particular substance, intended to provide workers and emergency personnel with ways to handle or work with that substance in a safe manner. the Msds includes information on the substance's health effects, toxicity, first aid, storage, disposal, protective equipment and how to handle accidental spills. the occupational safety and Health administration (osHa) requires that the Msds for any potentially harmful substance handled in the workplace must be available to employees. Microfiber. a fine synthetic fiber woven into cleaning cloths and lightweight mops that are ultra absorbent and use less cleaning solution. Microfibers have a positive charge. dust, dirt and microbes are not only attracted to the microfiber's positive charge, but are held tightly and not redistributed around the room. Monitoring. Checking the status of a pest infestation on a regular basis, often done with sticky traps. for example, you might monitor a cockroach infestation with special sticky traps for roaches and look at them every few days. you canthen note numbers and whether you're catching immature roaches (see 39 for a sample Pest Monitoring Log). as an essential part of IPM, monitoring helps you know when to treat or whether you should treat at all. Neurotoxic. Poisonous to the brain, nerves or nerve tissue. Nonexempt pesticide. sprays, foggers, and pellets or powder (if uncontained) are nonexempt pesticides. If these types of pesticides are used, centers must comply with the Healthy schools act by record keeping, providing written notification and postings. Pest Management Professional (PMP). the people formerly known as exterminators. for several years they've gone by the title of Pest Control operator or PCo, and many still use that name. More recently there's been a national trend to change the job title to Pest Management Professional. Pesticide resistance. When pests survive exposure to a pesticide, they may pass this ability on to their offspring. over time, pests often become resistant to a pesticide and different pesticides must be substituted to kill the pest. Registered pesticide. Pesticide products are thoroughly reviewed by the federal government (u.s. ePa) before being sold or used. In California, pesticide products must go through a strict approval process with dPr, including review of the product's toxicology, how it behaves in the environment, itseffectiveness against targeted pests, its hazards to nontarget organisms, fish and wildlife, and how it affects workers.Pesticides that pass this scientific, legal and administrative process are granted a license (that is, are registered), which permits their sale and use according to requirements set by dPr to protect human health and the environment. Confused about the term exempt pesticide? see Exempt pesticide on page 29. Risk. a combination of how toxic (poisonous) a substance is and one's exposure to it. (risk = toxicity x exposure.) exposure to a pesticide usually depends on its placement and how likely it is to cling to surfaces or evaporate. Toxicity. the quality or degree of being poisonous. your reaction to a toxic substance depends on the dose of the toxin, and your exposure and susceptibility (sensitivity). When asubstance has acute toxicity, it causes harmful effects within a short period following a dose or exposure, usually 96 hours or less. effects include sudden eye irritation, breathing problems, stomach pains and rashes. With chronic toxicity, the effects are delayed, possibly for years. examples include birth defects, cancer and hormonal disruption. allergic effects (see Allergic reaction ) are sometimes considered a separate category, and they include asthma, lung irritation and rashes. Trade name. a product name. there are many types of pesticides that manage specific pests. each pesticide can have different trade, or product, names. 30 Mosquito Eggs Pupa Larva Mosquitoes take about seven days to complete their life cycle. The first three stages, eggs , larva, and pupa, are aquatic. Therefore, the best way to prevent mosquito breeding is to remove stagnant water .\u00a9 2011 uCsf California Childcare Health Program California Childcare Health Program www.ucsfchildcarehealth.org uFact Sheets AB 405 List Pesticide Products Prohibited from Use in Schools http://apps.cdpr.ca.gov/schoolipm/school_ipm_law/prohibited_ prods.pdf California Department of Pesticide Regulation Childcare IPM: Growing Up Green www.cdpr.ca.gov/schoolipm/childcare California Department of Pesticide Regulation.

Policy [naMe of PrograM], will implement and practice IPM to manage pests in the buildings and grounds to minimize the exposure of children and staff to pesticides. California state law encourages licensed eCe centers to practice IPM and requires centers to notify all parents and staff before pesticides are applied inside or outside the facility (see Sample 72- Hour Notice of Specific Application on page 38). In accordance with the Healthy schools act, the center will: unotify parents and staff in writing every year w What pesticides are expected to be applied by center staff or a PMP in the upcoming year. uprovide parents and staff with the website address of the California department of Pesticide regulation's school IPM Program, apps.cdpr.ca.gov/schoolipm/ umaintain a registry of parents and staff who want to be notified, ahead of time, each time a pesticide is used. unotify parents of pesticide applications. Parents and staff who enroll in the registry will be notified of individual pesticide applications on the program site at least 72 hours before theapplication, which will include the name of the pesticide, active ingredient(s) in the product, and date the pesticide is to be applied. upost warning signs. Warning signs will be posted around each area where pesticides will be applied. these signs will be in place 24 hours before andstay in place 72 hours after pesticides are used. these signs will be large enough that they preventany adult from accidentally entering areas where pesticides have been used. (see Sample WarningSign on page 39.)u keep records of which pesticides have been used at the program site for the past four years and the records will be available to anyone who asks to see them. Pests our IPM policy is to actively work at reducing the presence of harmful pests in the facility. Pests can pose hazards to human health and the environment and damage property. Pesticides our IPM policy is to minimize potential exposure of children, staff and visitors to pesticides in our environment. exposure to pesticides can pose a health risk to children, staff, and others. regularly scheduled applications of harmful pesticides are not permitted under this IPM policy. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Program our IPM program will include the following: u regular monitoring to identify pest problems. u Preventive actions to reduce future pest problems. u Preference for the use of nonchemical management practices to address pest problems. u When necessary, use of least-hazardous pesticides after nonchemical management practices have failed. u training for staff and parents on IPM practices. u designating an IPM Coordinator for our site who will be responsible for overseeing the implementation of IPM practices. u use of the CCHP Health and Safety Notes and uC davis IPM website (see Resources ) for action plans on individual pests. u assess the eCe center's environment using the IPM Checklist annually. Pest Management Professionals (PMP) any PMP hired to provide pest management or other services must comply with this IPM program and notification policy and be knowledgeable about IPM practices, the requirements of the Healthy schools act and use of IPM. PMPs must refrain from routine pesticide spraying, provide detailed service reports with each visit and give recommendations for pest prevention. *this policy reflects the best practices on IPM as of april 2010. 33 \u00a9 2011 uCsf California Childcare Health ProgramI n t e g r a t e d P e s t M a n a g e M e n t : a C u r r I C u l u M f o r e a r l y C a r e a n d e d u C a t I o n P r o g r a M s SAMPLE LETTER EXPLAINING ANNUAL WRITTEN NOTIFICATION REQUIREMENT [eCe Center naMe] is required by the Healthy schools act to provide information to parents and guardians about nonexempt pesticides we expect to use in the coming year. this notification will include the pesticide name, active ingredient(s), and information on pesticides and their alternatives. [eCe Center naMe] uses an integrated pest management (IPM) approach to managing ants, rodents and other pests. our goal is to protect the health of our children and staff and the environment by reducing pesticide use. Prevention is critical to this approach, and we work hard to keep pests out of our building, and remove their access to food, water and shelter. When pests enter our facility, our staff tries to use nonchemical and least-harmful methods to deal with them. occasionally, we use pesticides to manage these pest problems. Pesticides are only used as a last resort. Certain pesticides, such as self-contained baits or traps, and gels or pastes used in cracks and crevices, are exempt from the requirements of the Healthy schools act. they are applied in ways that limit children's exposure and contain non- toxic or least harmful substances. Parents and guardians may also request to be notified about individual pesticide applications throughout the year. Beginning [date], parents and guardians who choose to be included in this registry will be notified at least 3 days before nonexempt pesticides (such as sprays and foggers) are applied. If you would like to be notified every time a nonexempt pesticide is applied, please complete and return the attached form and return it to [naMe of eCe Center IPM CoordInator, address]. for more information on pesticides and integrated pest management see the department of Pesticide regulation's school Integrated Pest Management Website at: apps.cdpr.ca.gov/schoolipm/childcare or the California Childcare Health Program's IPM toolkit for early Care and education Programs at: www.ucsfchildcarehealth.org/html/pandr/trainingcurrmain.htm If you have any questions, please contact [naMe of eCe Center IPM CoordInator] at [PHone PHone and eMaIl][date] 34\u00a9 2011 uCsf California Childcare Health ProgramI n t e g r a t e d P e s t M a n a g e M e n t : a C u r r I C u l u M f o r e a r l y C a r e a n d e d u C a t I o n P r o g r a M s PARENT/STAFF APPLICATION TO BE ENROLLED IN THE NOTIFICATION REGISTRY reQuest By Parent to suBsCrIBe to regIstry In order to reCeIve notIfICatIon of IndIvIdual PestICIde aPPlICatIon [naMe of eCe Center] I understand that, upon request, the child care center listed above is required to supply information about individual pesticide applications at least 72 hours before application.
