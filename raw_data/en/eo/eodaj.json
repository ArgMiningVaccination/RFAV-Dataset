Hi Nicole, what was your thought process behind starting your own business? Thank you so much for letting me share my story. There were two major factors that motivated me to start my energy healing practice, Ouroboros Healing. First, I wanted to get out of the animation industry, because I found it to be very toxic. Second, I knew deep within me that I had a bigger purpose in life. I'd often think to myself, \"I know there's something bigger for me out there!\" or my fave, \"One day I'm going to be sitting on that couch with Oprah!\" Around 2012, about a year after landing my dream job at one of the biggest animation studios, responsible for creating the cartoons of my youth, the inner calling got louder and had me feeling kind of lost. As happy as I was to have achieved the goal of getting hired, I wasn't actually happy there and experienced a very \"cliquey\" kind of atmosphere, as well as some good old fashion nepotism. In between projects I searched aimlessly for that thing I was \"supposed to\" be doing. I had such a desire within me for \"something\" and I could feel it pulling me closer, to what? I didn't know. Since I didn't know exactly what I was looking for, I felt really frustrated a lot of times. I went on to work at three of the top ranking animation studios in Burbank, CA. Overall, most people in the industry are great but the standards that are common practice seem to be systemic issues. Work-life balance is non-existent on most projects and the animation industry was basically founded by a sexist and a racist. So while that may have unfortunately been \"the norm\" for many men at that time, those ideals permeated everyday animation culture and stuck around 20, 30, 50, even 100 years later, affecting opportunities and wages, especially for those working in production. Many production staffers can make as low as 5x less than artists, even though both roles are necessary for a successful production. Women in animation need to prove themselves and work at least twice as hard to be taken seriously. Some women that I'd met in school and throughout my career eventually left the industry altogether. Not to mention there is rampant sexism in educational institutes that teach animation and video game production. I personally experienced sexism while attending Gnomon School of Visual Effects. For these and other reasons, there's about a 20-40% drop off rate for women in animation. For those of us who stay, production seems to be where we can excel and climb the ladder. But, in my opinion this only perpetuates the idea that women are playing a supporting role to the men in positions of power. With the exception of Netflix Animation, all the other studios I've ever worked at, large or small, had a really hard time with paying fair compensation, putting women or WOC in lead creative roles and positions of power, or correcting situations in which men act like frat boys. And I'm sure every woman has experienced this situation: You share an idea or suggestion and it's questioned or shot down. Perhaps you get feedback like...\"mmmmm yea, no. That doesn't feel right\" Then, a minute later, a man will say the SAME THING you just said, sometimes verbatim, and that's when it's heard, accepted, and praised. It's the absolute worst! Like what even is that?? After many of those types of situations, I knew I needed to start working on an exit strategy. I was sick of gathering around conference tables confined within those antiquated walls. I wanted out. I was in between productions so I decided to start a subscription box company to help women focus on self-care. I was good at branding and had a love for all natural skin care products, spiritual tools, goddess themes, and moon cycles. Throughout my life I'd been surrounded by women who worked very hard, some burning the candle at both ends, but they never gave back to themselves.They were selfless and gave so much to others but had trouble taking time for themselves. So this was the inspiration and the woman I was serving with the brand I created. Although I ended up closing my door a year later, my first business taught me a lot, especially what not to do. Since I was already used to working through burnout, working on the business and nothing else seemed like the only way to succeed. After my business partner went MIA, there was a lot of pressure to make it work, to be profitable, and to fix the mistakes that were made in the beginning. Every month I had to do the product sourcing, packing, shipping, marketing, customer service, and social media on my own. With that being said, I didn't feel comfortable admitting to my friends or my followers that I was drowning. This was at the height of #BossBitch #Hustle culture. I was able to keep it going for a few months until I got re-hired at another studio, so I was basically working two full time jobs. It was hell. I knew I was passionate about helping women but I knew this wasn't the way to do it. After I closed the doors I felt like such a failure. I carried so much shame around that ending because I tried SO HARD!! For anyone out there who needs to hear this, it's so important not to judge yourself based on your first try as an entrepreneur! Don't stop creating or sharing your gifts! It took some time but I had to accept that my effort and my determination to make it work were totally independent of the reasons why it didn't work. There are so many moving pieces, they don't all fall on us. Now years later, I'm so grateful for the experience and I know that it was a major stepping stone to get me where I am today. However, prior to learning these sage lessons, I felt wiped out! I was burnt out, and pushed way past my limits. I needed help figuring out what happened and how to pick up the pieces. I needed to start my exit plan. So, I started working with Maxine Dillon of Blue Star Guidance, a life coach that specializes in helping women leave toxic work environments and build a career that resonates with our creative spirit. During our work together I was able to dig deeper into healing my past traumas and pushed myself towards my own expansion. I began to transform into the woman who could hold space for that mysterious calling that had been guiding and nudging me forward all those years. Over the next few years I went deeper into my spirituality, learning tarot and practicing the craft. I learned about candle magic for manifestation, human design, epigenetics, and attachment theory. I also got certified in Reiki so that I could learn how to work with energy and continue to heal myself energetically. After many rounds of shadow work sessions with my coach, I realized that my life had been blessed with many challenges to overcome. I also noticed that my experiences with men had a common thread; disappointment, betrayal, and narcissism. From my early life, into my work and romantic relationships, this was a pattern that resurfaced. The question \"Why?\" took over. Why this way? Why me? The answer was my biggest breakthrough, and what helped me bring it all together, which was that all of the experiences I went through needed to be transmuted into education that I could share with other women who were experiencing a similar path as I had. I knew that I could help other women avoid a lot of the heartbreak and roadblocks that I encountered. I always wanted to empower women and I finally found a way that was authentic for me. By this realization point, I had grown as an energy healer and earned certifications in Reiki, Emotion Code, and Akashic Records. I also studied Transpersonal Spiritual Counseling for two years under my coach. My desire became clear. I was going to merge my knowledge of energy healing and its effects on our mental and emotional health with my own life lessons on reclaiming self-worth. I wanted to teach other women how to heal from toxic relationships so they can reclaim their power. So with lots of support and encouragement from my inner circle, I committed to my exit plan. I saved up for about a year, lovingly I called my \"Fuck You Fund.\" Once that was ready to go, I gracefully bowed out in February of 2021 to start my own coaching and energy healing practice. I don't want any woman to feel like they are destined to stay stuck, feel unworthy of love, or think they are undeserving of a full abundant life, all because someone else has convinced them they weren't. Me and my business, Ouroboros Healing, are here to create a space for my clients' vulnerability to exist and be seen, so their divine feminine power can emerge and guide them towards the life they truly desire. What should our readers know about your business? So the name of my healing practice is Ouroboros Healing. The symbol always spoke to me and made an appearance almost daily when I was thinking of a name for the business. The Ouroboros [oor-uh-bohr-uh s] is one of the oldest known symbols, representing renewal and the cycles of life, death, and rebirth. When left with nothing to eat, the serpent feeds on its own tail, becoming the \"ouroboros.\" It can sustain itself and become its own source of nourishment and life, or it can too quickly consume itself and be the cause of its own destruction. I chose the Ouroboros to highlight a symbolic \"choice point\". Ultimately, we all have to make the choice to become our own source of power or to do nothing and be consumed by our circumstances. I have found in my life and in my clients' lives that there is \"something,\" a kind of block that is holding us back from living the life we want or finding the love we deserve. Usually, there are core beliefs or limiting beliefs that convince us of something, at a subconscious level. For example, a belief could tell us that if we put our guard down and share ourselves fully in relationship, they will truly see us, and leave us. Then we unconsciously self-sabotage our relationships or spend most of our life dating people who don't require too much of us, all in the name of keeping ourself \"safe\". Our subconscious is always trying to protect us, so it will come up with all sorts of ways to do that. Even if that protection keeps us away from the very thing we desire most. I help clients dig deep to discover what their limiting core beliefs are. A lot of times they develop from a collection of events that take place in our formative years that manifest into traumas in adulthood that may seem \"normal\" to us at first. They say that you receive the same love as an adult that you were taught to receive as a child. So if your relationships are suffering, or you're noticing a repeating pattern, it may be time to face some old wounds. And yes, it's uncomfortable and it can feel scary to face the events that have hurt us the most. Oftentimes, these are things we've suppressed our whole lives, and we've worked really hard to avoid them. So it's definitely a personal choice to start doing shadow work. But once they are ready, they'll be making a choice that will change their lives for the better. I would describe my healing practice as a deeply personal, holistic approach to helping clients reclaim self-worth and heal the patterns that are keeping them stuck in toxic relationships. What sets me apart is that I merge intuitive energy healing, psychology, and transpersonal spiritual counseling into my sessions, so no two sessions are ever the same. I believe there is so much to be gained from science and proven psychology theories. For example, in my group work, I spend an entire month teaching self-awareness and how to be a judgement free observer using the Cognitive Behavior Theory. At the same time, I'm very much open to the fact that life itself is made of magick. There are things about us as humans and this Earthly plane that are not seen under a microscope and they can't be proven in a lab... yet. I see myself as a conduit, receiving messages from both my clients' guides and my guides. This actually helps me connect and guide each client on a whole other level. I am a clairaudient intuitive healer, meaning I can hear messages or receive downloads from my guides about a client or their situation. So for example, if a client can't fully express themselves, I may get a message or hear a word from a source that's outside of myself. If needed, I will convey the messages I receive, which can really help my clients feel seen and validated when struggling to find words to express the emotions they're feeling. Or, if I'm guided to switch to a new topic or bring attention to something they are feeling physically, I can sense this because I'm also an empath and can feel physical sensations that my client is feeling. I flow where I'm intuitively taken, and I trust this is where they need help or guidance. I'm most proud when I'm able to teach my clients how to connect to their own wells of wisdom and love, their psychic abilities, and their intuition- the stuff with which we are all born. I love when they start reclaiming their confidence and power; you know, that inner fire that can get snuffed out while living a full life of ups and downs. The biggest lesson I've learned along the way to building this business is that everything takes time and everything happens right on time. I was suuuuper impatient as a kid, and this was my biggest challenge as an adult. Our life is unfolding with everything else, simultaneously, perfectly. I have to remind myself to get out of the way. The \"Pushing\" energy we're all used to is very masculine, and there is definitely a time for this. But when it starts to feel frustrating, hard, or forced, it's time to implement the feminine energy approach - to pull, attract and receive. Pull back your energy, conserve your energy, and redirect your focus to what FEELS GOOD so you can raise your vibration. Release what doesn't feel easy and do what feels good and easy to you, then allow the Universe to deliver what is yours- what's just for you. Sometimes what we want isn't what's right for us. Sometimes what we think we are ready for, we wouldn't be able to handle if we got it when we want it. So we have to keep working on ourselves and preparing ourselves to be ready to receive what we really want. I've had to surrender A LOT. ALL THE TIME. And it totally sucks in the moment, especially when it's a new concept. But with practice, trust will develop. You'll start to notice when you surrender and move from \"pushing\" to \"trusting\", that the person, place, or thing that is meant for you will appear. You'll start seeing the pattern of it working out and you will trust it more and more. I want the world to know that I'm here to support you in your transformation! I believe that we all have gifts to share with the world, and that our gifts are meant to change the world for the better. I'm here to remind you of your brilliance, to remind you that if you're struggling or living a life you don't want to live, it's only temporary. You can leave that abusive relationship, quit that toxic job, dump those selfish friends, and find love and success in new ways that are 100% in alignment with who you are becoming. If there is something in life you want to achieve, it's totally possible with the right support and guidance. We all need someone coaching us to greatness. If this has resonated with you or your feeling inspired to step into your power with my support and guidance, I encourage you to reach out and book a free 1 hour Clarity Session. You don't have to do it alone, anymore. Xoxo - Nicole Let's say your best friend was visiting the area and you wanted to show them the best time ever. Where would you take them? Give us a little itinerary - say it was a week long trip, where would you eat, drink, visit, hang out, etc. I'm an LA native, and I like to experience life more than shopping or sightseeing, so this is how I would do it. Welcome dinner at Petit Trois, and go beast mode, order everything. I'd hit the beach in Laguna midweek, I know its not in the city and kind of far but it's so worth it! It's so beautiful and the closest we'll get to a Hawaiian beach. I'd also share a nice hike in Crestline around Lake Gregory or Lake Arrowhead to get some real nature in our face. Catch a Dodger game after some pre-game brews at the Highland Park Brewery, and take a Lime scooter up to the stadium to avoid parking or Uber/Lyft madness. Saturday, I'd see where Princess Frank was playing some live music...maybe go dancing at La Descarga in Hollywood, but get out before the cuban cigars get too intense. Definitely follow any night of dancing with some Al Pastor tacos at The Flaming Taco off Sunset and Alvarado. I would have to say that Sunday brunch at Perch with mimosas would have to happen if we're in a lounge mode. If we're up for a walk, I'd suggest brunch at The Kitchen at Descanso Gardens, followed by a walk in the garden. Shoutout is all about shouting out others who you feel deserve additional recognition and exposure. Who would you like to shoutout? I would have to say that my coach, Maxine Dillon deserves a big shout out because she really helped guide me towards the blurry visions I had for my life and helped me get clarity. She helped me align with my deepest desires so I could make them a reality. She showed me how to heal myself, how to hold space for the wounded child that lived within me, and she set the example for what was possible. I'm forever grateful for her and for her own courage to break free and live her life authentically. An incredible reminder that our courage to live in alignment can literally change the lives of other people who will one day receive our magick! And of course, a huge shout out to my partner and soul mate, Mike Migaleddi. He's been a big part of this journey, and my biggest supporter, always encouraging me, supporting me, and being a mirror to my shadow aspects, reminding me that they need some love and attention. I never thought I would be loved fully, all of me, the ugly crusty bits...truly unconditionally loved until I lived it with you. I you mucho Sasha M.
