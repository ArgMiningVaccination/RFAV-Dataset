Your body is your subconscious, and your symptoms are merely a message to be decoded. It's time to elevate your gut, hormonal, and mental health with science and spiritual wisdom. Aren't you tired of being at war with your body, emotions, and food? The largest missing link in Western Medicine is the lack of acknowledgement that for every physical symptom there is an energetic and emotional root. Maybe you've found yourself sitting in a doctor's office hearing \"your labs are all normal\" despite the fact that you don't feel normal Maybe you've struggled with your relationship with food, your weight, or body image. Maybe you've tried all the fad diets and trending supplements - only to be left with the same weight, bloat, or discomfort that you were before. The good news? These cycles [with with your body, emotions, and food] didn't begin with you, but they can end with you.

Meet your guide Hi, I'm Nia, holistic Nutritionist, Mind-Body Practitioner, and former yo-yo Dieter. My mission is simple, to be the guide I wished I had. I was once in your shoes; struggling with food, my weight, and life. At 13 years old, I weighed over 225 pounds as a result of my addiction to the comfort food provided me. Though I managed to lose weight from extreme measures like keto and juice cleanses, my eating became so disordered in the process. I spent most of my teenage years and 20s fearing carbs and calories, while suffering from a severe lack of self-worth and love. Spoiler alert: no diet or \"clean eating\" lifestyle never satisfied what I really wanted, which was lightness and confidence in my body. It wasn't until I dove deep into myself through spirituality and energy healing did I understand that my emotions and body were simply reflections of my spirit...
