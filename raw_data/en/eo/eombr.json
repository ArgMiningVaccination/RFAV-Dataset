All the necessary content is covered and assessed in this Teacher's Guide and the Learner's Book, and there are also lots of extra ideas and resources to make Social Sciences come alive in the classroom. Social Sciences consists of Geography and History, which are taught separately, but given the same amount of teaching time each term. Both should be taught and assessed as separate subjects during every term of the school year. Although Geography and History are taught separately, the curriculum is designed so that you can make links between the two in terms of content, skills and concepts.IntroductionIntroduction The Social Sciences curriculum The general aims of the Social Sciences curriculum are to: Encourage Phase). Provide opportunities for learners to look at their own worlds in new ways. Create opportunities for learners to develop a critical perspective. Introduce learners to a world beyond their everyday life and reality. Provide access to knowledge that learners might not otherwise be able to access. Develop expertise and confidence in learners as a result of in-depth learning (suggested time for each topic is stated). Facilitate learning through different forms of text (oral, written and visual). T rain learners to speculate, to debate, to make connections, to select, to prioritise, and to tackle real issues and important issues. Provide opportunities for learners to write regularly, with a clear progression in length and complexity through the grades (evidence of learner's work should be kept in the learner's notebook, folder or file). Resources for teaching and learning Social Sciences Each learner should have: A quality textbook that is suitable for the grade, context and language level of the learner, for example Study & Master Social Sciences. A notebook (for writing in), which should be covered with paper (and plastic, if possible), kept neat and looked after - this is an important record of the learner's work.2 INTRODUCTION Access to wall maps (World map, Africa map and South Africa map). Access to a globe. Access to a set of atlases and dictionaries. Access to books about the History and Geography topics. Access to visual material about the History and Geography topics. In Social Sciences learners should read and write often, starting with sentences and paragraphs and building up to longer pieces of work. A lot of this writing work can be achieved by working through the activities provided in the Learner's Book of Study & Master Social Sciences. Other reliable and relevant sources of information that enrich the curriculum should also be used - carefully selected and reviewed by the teacher. Additional resources: Magazines and newspapers with articles relevant to the topics. Access to a TV/DVD and/or CD player to present appropriate visual and audiovisual material. Access to the Internet and appropriate educational websites. Map/s of the learner's local area. The MapPack Project will give free maps and additional information to schools. Contact them at The MapPack Project, Private Bag X10, Mowbray 7700, Phone: 021 658 4300, Email: ngi@ruraldevelopment.gov.za. Teaching and learning History History is the study of change and development in a society over time. History is also a process of enquiry that involves asking questions about the past: what happened?, when?, why?, etc. The teaching of History should encourage learners to be interested in and enjoy the study of the past and how it was shaped. Learners should develop an understanding of historical concepts, including historical sources and evidence. The specific aims and skills of History The specific aims and skills - summarised in the table on the next page - are met through the teaching of content, skills and concepts. The table lists the specific aims, and examples of skills.3 INTRODUCTIONSpecific aims of History Examples of skills involved Find a variety of kinds of information about the pastUse and bring together different sources of information Select relevant information Decide about the importance and relevance of information to choose and use for different purposes and contexts Decide whether information can be trusted Investigate where information came from, whether it is accurate, and what point of view is represented in the information See something that happened in the past from more than one point of viewContrast information and compare points of view about the same person or event Explain why events in the past are often interpreted differentlyRecognise and understand how and why different sources and people come to different conclusions Debate about what happened in the past on the basis of the available evidenceDebate and discuss own and others' points of view about aspects of history, based on evidence Write history in an organised way, with a logical line of argument Write history texts which have an introduction, which set out relevant information in a structured way, and which come to a conclusion Demonstrate understanding of the importance of heritage and conservationExplain how and why people and events are publicly remembered and commemorated The study of History should also support democratic citizenship through: Explaining and encouraging the values of the Constitution. Encouraging civic responsibility and responsible leadership. Promoting human rights and peace. Preparing young people for local, regional, national, continental and global responsibility. Concepts in History History is in sources and in evidence, and it is also in the way sources and evidence are interpreted. There are many ways of looking at the same thing in the past. It may involve: Different points of view of people in the past with different positions in society. Different ways in which historians write about people and sources. Different ways in which people today see the lives of people in the past. This requires a multi-perspective approach. Other important concepts in History that learners should understand are: Cause and effect: The reasons for events and the results of these events, and the way that humans behave in the events and as a result of those events. Change and continuity: Over a period of time it is possible to compare and contrast what has changed and what has remained the same. Time and chronology: History is studied and written in order - it is important to be able to place events in the order in which they happened in time; a timeline is useful to develop this concept.4 INTRODUCTIONTeaching and learning Geography Geography is the study of the human and physical environment. Geography examines both physical (environmental) and human processes over space and time. Everything in Geography has a spatial aspect to it and happens in an environment that is always changing. The specific aims and skills of Geography The specific aims and skills - summarised in the table below - are met through the teaching of content, skills and concepts. The table lists the specific aims, and examples of skills. Specific aims of Geography Examples of skills involved Develop curiosity about the world we live inAsk questions, identify issues, listen and discuss with interest; and collect and refer to different types of information Acquire a good general knowledge of places and the natural forces at work on EarthRead and use sources for information; and use information to describe, explain and answer questions about people and places Understand the interaction between society and the natural environmentConsider, synthesise and organise information; make links between cause and effect; acknowledge and appreciate diverse lifestyles and world views Think independently and be able to support ideas with knowledge Use geographical knowledge to solve problems, to discuss and debate issues, to recognise bias, to develop own ideas, and to suggest solutions to problems Care about our planet and the well-being of all who live on itEngage in an informed and sensitive way with issues relating to the planet, its people and resources Understand and work with a range of sources \u2014 including maps, data and photographsUse and draw maps; identify and extract information from texts, atlases and other sources; work with data and statistics; cross-reference information Observe and engage with phenomena in the local environmentObserve, interview and record; apply social skills; process, interpret and evaluate data Find out about places, people, events and issues using different sources (e.g. books, people, photographs, the Internet)Devise and frame questions; develop and apply research skills; analyse, process and present information Communicate ideas and information Speak in a clear and informed way; write in a structured and coherent way; draw maps and visual information; provide reasoned explanations Make informed decisions and take appropriate actionWork co-operatively, and independently; plan and evaluate actions systematically and critically Map skills The study of Geography requires learners to interpret and present different types of visual information, for example: maps, graphs, globes, photographs, aerial views and drawings. This visual literacy is an essential type of literacy for learners to practise and develop. In the CAPS curriculum there is special focus for one term of each grade on aspects of using and making maps and other visual sources. These topics aim to achieve focused and systematic development of visual skills. However, learners should work with maps during the whole year and map use should be integrated into topics throughout each grade.5 INTRODUCTIONConcepts in Geography The following are key concepts for learners to know and understand in Geography: Space and spatial patterns and trends: The location of people and places in the world. Similarity and difference: How environments and lifestyles compare and the reasons for similarities and differences. Movement: How and why people, goods, water, land and air move and change. Planet Earth: Land, air and water. Human settlement: Where people live and why. Human activities: What people do, how the environment affects them and how people affect the environment. Interdependence: The links between climate, vegetation, wildlife, resource distribution, and human settlement and activity. Change: The changing nature of people and places. Overview of topics for Intermediate Phase Social Sciences The following tables show an overview of all the topics for Geography and History Intermediate Phase, organised per term. These topics are then broken up into sub-topics for teaching - topics and sub-topics are organised into modules and units in the Study & Master Social Sciences books. Geography content overview Term Grade 4 topics Grade 5 topics Grade 6 topics 1 Places where people live (settlements)Map skills (focus: Africa) Map skills (focus: World) 2 Map skills Physical features of South AfricaTrade (focus: South Africa and world) 3 Food and farming in South AfricaWeather, climate and vegetation of South AfricaClimate and vegetation around the world 4 Water in South Africa Minerals and mining in South AfricaPopulation \u2014 why people live where they do (focus: South Africa and world) History content overview Term Grade 4 topics Grade 5 topics Grade 6 topics 1 Local history Hunter-gatherers and herders in southern AfricaAn African kingdom long ago in southern Africa: Mapungubwe 2 Learning from leaders The first farmers in southern AfricaExplorers from Europe find southern Africa 3 Transport through time An ancient African society: EgyptDemocracy and citizenship in South Africa 4 Communication through timeA heritage trail through the provinces of South AfricaMedicine through time6 INTRODUCTIONTime allocation and weighting of topics Both Geography and History should be taught and assessed in every term of the school year. The teaching time for Social Sciences in the Intermediate and Senior Phases is 3 hours per week (e.g. 1,5 hours for Geography and 1,5 hours for History). A term of 10 weeks should have 30 hours of contact time. The total time allocation for History is about 15 hours per 10-week term, and the same for Geography. In order to plan the total time available, suggested time allocation (and weighting) is given for each topic/unit. Assessment in Social Sciences Assessment is a planned and continuous process of identifying, gathering and interpreting information about the performance of learners. Teachers should use the information they gain from evidence of achievement to improve the process of learning and teaching. Assessment should be both informal (assessment for learning) and formal (assessment of learning). Giving feedback to learners must always be a part of any assessment process. Steps in assessing Assessment can be achieved in four main steps or stages. 1. Generate and collect evidence of achie vement 3. Record findings about achievement4. Use evidence of achievement to under stand and help learner2. Evaluate evidence of achievemen t In assessing knowledge, teachers will be assessing the learner's ability to achieve the aims and demonstrate the skills outlined in the Curriculum and Assessment Policy Statement (CAPS). Teachers will need to collect and evaluate evidence of a learner's achievement, and to record the evidence, if appropriate to that type of assessment. The aims and skills for Geography and History must be applied in the content knowledge as well as in the activities, tasks, projects, tests and examinations. Geography and History must be assessed separately, and learners must complete assessment tasks each term for Geography and for History. Assessment marks for each subject should also be shown 7 INTRODUCTIONseparately in school reports: a score for Geography and a score for History. The scores should then be added together and divided by two to give an average score or mark for Social Sciences. Types of assessment Informal assessment Informal assessment is the daily or lesson-by-lesson monitoring of learners' progress. Learners can be informally assessed through: observation of learner discussion with learner demonstration with learner learner-teacher meetings informal classroom interaction. Informal assessment should be used to provide feedback to the learners and to inform planning for teaching. Teachers don't have to record informal assessment, but they can choose to record some or any of it. The results of informal assessment are not used for promotion and certification purposes, but it is nevertheless useful to have a record of learners' progress throughout the year. Formal assessment Formal assessment tasks (FATs) are part of a formal programme of assessment for a particular grade and year. Formal assessment tasks are marked and the mark is recorded by the teacher for progression and certification purposes. Formal assessment provides teachers with a systematic way of evaluating how well learners are progressing in a grade and in a particular subject. The CAPS Amendments document to the National Curriculum Statement (NCS) for the Intermediate Phase specifies a Programme of Assessment for Social Sciences. In Grade 6 the programme of assessment is structured as follows. Term Subject Assessment Marks Continuous/End-of-year 1 Geography Test 40 Continuous assessment 75 %History Test 40 2 Geography June examination40 History June examination40 3 Geography Task 40 History Project 40 4 Geography November examination40 End-of-year assessment 25 % History November examination40 As shown in the table above, learners are required to complete one project every year in Social Sciences. They do a project in either Geography or History in a given year. Projects should be started 8 INTRODUCTIONtowards the beginning of a term, and learners must be given a reasonable due date to hand in the final work. Teachers should make sure they have enough time for assessing the projects, and the learners' progress must be monitored regularly. You will find the History project for Grade 6 on page 154 of the Study & Master Social Sciences Learner's Book and page 143 of this Teacher's Guide (Module 7, Unit 8: Research project: A biography). A rubric for assessing the project is provided on page 42 of the Formal Assessment Programme section of this Teacher's Guide. In the Intermediate Phase the CAPS curriculum divides the projects between the two subjects as follows. Grade Term Subject 4 1 History project 5 3 Geography project 6 3 History project Planning assessment Setting good assessment tasks can be very challenging and teachers are encouraged to use carefully selected textbooks as a guide, and to share good assessment tasks with other teachers. The following steps were followed in the planning and design of assessment tasks for Study & Master Social Sciences.1. Clarify the purpose of the assessment. (Why?) 2. Decide on the task or activity to be assessed. (Which?) 3. Decide on the content, concepts and skills to be assessed. (What?) 4. Select a format for learner presentation - how will the learner show evidence or demonstrate achievement? (H ow?) Learners are required to write examinations in June and November in both Geography and History. You may wish to set this examination yourself, based on the needs of your learners, and the work you have covered. However, in the Formal Assessment Programme section of this Teacher's Guide, we have provided samples of all the prescribed tasks, including the two examinations for both disciplines of Social Sciences, as well as marking memoranda, for your convenience. There is also a useful record sheet for recording marks for the FAT component of assessment. Assessing writing Assessment usually involves writing - this means that learners should be taught writing skills in Social Sciences and should be helped to practise those skills. For writing longer texts, especially essays, learners need to be trained to: Select the information they want to include - only choose what is relevant. Arrange the information - put it together with other information and integrate it.9 INTRODUCTION Connect information - to make a logical order, or a developed argument. As well as all types of written work, other ways of showing evidence of achievement should also be used for assessment, for example: oral work, discussion, debate, role plays, visual work, presentations and drama. Plagiarism (using somebody else's work and pretending it is your own) is a problem in many institutions of learning. Whether the plagiarism involves copying from a book, copying another learner's work, or cutting and pasting from the Internet, it is wrong - like 'stealing' someone else's work. Learners must be trained to show in their work whenever they quote something from a source, and to give their references for the source. Learners should also be trained not to rely too much on sources and references, but rather to show their understanding by re-writing or re-phrasing source information in their own words.10 INTRODUCTIONHow Study & Master Social Sciences works Study & Master Social Sciences Learner's Book and Teacher's Guide work together like this. Note that the Geography content is placed first (Module 1 to 4), followed by the History content (Module 5 to 8). However, Geography and History must be taught at the same time, not the one after the other. The Learner's Book Each unit starts with a key question.Activities are marked as individual, pair, group or class work. It's easy to find your way around the text, by looking at the bottom of the page.UNIT 1 TERM 3 140Unit 11Unit Democratic change Apartheid ended officially on 27 April 1994. On that day, South Africa became a democracy. All South African adults were finally allowed to vote. They could vote for the political party they wanted in government. Before this, only white people were allowed to vote. Today, we celebrate 27 April as Freedom Day. Key question What is a democracy and how does it work? G In 1994, millions of South Africans waited for hours in long queues for the chance to vote. Activity 1. Interview two adults about what it was like to vote in 1994 when South Africa became a democracy. Ask them these questions. Add two questions of your own. a) Was it the first time you had voted? b) Why did you decide to vote? c) Where did you vote? d) What do you remember about that day? e) How did you feel before voting? f) How did you feel after voting? g) Do you think it is important for people to vote? Explain why, or why not. When decisions are made in a democratic way, everyone has an equal say. Decisions can be made democratically anywhere, including at home and at school. The word IEach module ends with a Revision activity and a Summary.Words in bold are explained in the Word list at the back of the book.Work is divided into units that reflect the CAPS curriculum. Units are grouped by Module per term.11 INTRODUCTION2 UNIT 1 MODULE 1Curriculum content and concepts Latitude and longitude on a globe (degrees) Concept of hemisphere - Northern and southern hemispheres - divided by the equator - Eastern and western hemispheres - divided by the Greenwich Meridian and 180\u00b0 longitude - Any place on the globe is in two hemispheres - north or south and east or west - Location of South Africa in southern and eastern hemispheres Latitude and longitude on a map (degrees) - from a globe to a flat map Locate selected countries and cities in degrees of latitude and longitude Teaching notes You will need: a large globe, atlases Start this Module with the Pair Activity in 'What do you know already?' on Learner's Book page 5. If possible give each pair a copy of the world map from the Extra resources section, for the learners to write their answers in pencil on the map. Give learners 15-20 minutes to complete the Activity and then discuss the answers as a class. This should give you a good sense of what learners know and remember about the world map and map work skills from Grades 4 and 5. This Activity should be quite easy and straightforward for learners to complete correctly. Show the class the globe and point out the continents and oceans, and the equator. Then point out the lines of latitude and longitude, and explain their purpose in helping us find places (navigation). Walk around the class so that all learners see the lines of latitude. Point out the N orth and South Pole and the Greenwich meridian line - which is the 0\u00b0 line of longitude. Explain that the shape of the Earth is called a sphere (round ball), and that the equator divides the sphere into 2 hemispheres: northern and southern. Point to the Greenwich meridian line and show the eastern and western hemispheres. If you cannot get a globe, try to get a range of pictures showing the world map as a globe so that learners can see the difference between the flat two-dimensional representation we use for maps and the more realistic three-dimensional globe. Read through Learner's Book page 6 with the class and ask questions related to the content to check learners' understanding of the concepts so far, and to see where more explaining might be needed.Unit 11Unit Latitude and longitude Learner's Book pages 6-15 4 hoursThe Teacher's Guide The curriculum information is clearly laid out on the opener page.Curriculum concepts Time allocation 47 UNIT 4 MODULE 3Individual 1.

There are answers to every activity in the Learner's Book.42 UNIT 3 MODULE 3Bright idea!Timbuktu's climate change fight Farmers on the frontline of climate change around Timbuktu in northern Mali have been turning the desert green. Unpredictable rainfall and deforestation have seen the Sahara Desert encroach on the historic town over the last few years, but now irrigation projects are helping farmers to fight back. Timbuktu is fortunate to be just a few kilometres from the massive inland delta of the River Niger, and draws water from vast underground aquifers - bodies of permeable rock which transmit water. A women's co-operative in the village of Kabara, south of Timbuktu, is using these water sources to plant eucalyptus trees. They nurture them for two years, after which the trees can then survive almost without rain. In a region where the annual rainfall is less than 400 mm, reforestation is essential to put nutrients back into the soil, and to prevent erosion by the harsh desert winds. Windbreaks and vegetables Despite some scientists' concerns that eucalyptus trees can drain large amounts of water out of the soil, Daouda Diarra from the World Food Programme in Mali says they are a good choice in the desert environment. 'Eucalyptus is especially recommended for its rapid growth and the protection it gives against strong winds,' Mr Diarra says. 'In dry zones, a five-year-old tree's root system actually pumps water back into the water table.' The co-operative's president, Zeinabi Maiga, says they can now grow beans and other vegetables on land which was previously useless. 'Before the co-operative project started, our husbands were always away from home looking for work,' she says. 'But now they don't have to go because we can grow food here.' Mrs Maiga says there have been other benefits too: 'The men always used to take decisions for the family, now the women are also making a contribution.'

While the pairs are working go around the class to help and to assess them informally. When the pairs have completed the work, go through the answers as a class. As you move on to 'Locating places using lines of latitude and longitude' (Learner's Book page 12), remind learners of the content from Grade 5 - working with grids and finding co-ordinates. Some learners may also know about co-ordinates from GPS devices or receivers, for example in their parents' cars. (The Global Positioning System (GPS) is a satellite navigation system in space that provides information about location anywhere on the Earth.) Read the text on Learner's Book page 12 aloud, and ask for volunteers to read each of the 5 bulleted points. Read through the Activity on Learner's Book page 13 and make sure learners understand what they are required to do. Then ask learners to work on their own to complete the Activity in their notebooks. (For Question 4 learners work with a partner.) Draw the grid accurately on the board (or on a large piece of paper) and ask for volunteers to answer the questions using the big grid. For the last Activity of the Unit, start by asking learners to look at the map on Learner's Book pages 14-15 and to tell you the co-ordinates of Mexico City and Nairobi. This will give everyone practice at finding co-ordinates. Then ask learners to work in pairs to complete the Activity on Learner's Book pages 14-15 and to write the answers in their notebooks. For Question 2 of the Activity on Learner's Book page 15, learners should draw the table with a ruler and pencil in their notebooks and fill in the city names using a pen. Finding the information on the map and filling in the information in the table can take a lot of classroom time, but this is an important task for learners' skills development and you should informally assess the work. If you want the Activity to be completed more quickly, ask each pair of learners to work with another pair - each group of 4 shares the work of filling out the table (each pair works on half the list, then the group combines answers). There is a photocopiable filled-in table in the Extra resources section; give it to learners so they can mark their own work. They should then glue or tape the photocopied table in their notebooks, after their marked table.4 UNIT 1 MODULE 1 After going through the answers with the class and checking all the co-ordinates, take in the notebooks for informal assessment of the Activities in this Unit. Please note: Ask learners to look for and bring newspaper articles about: places in your province, other South African provinces, African countries, cities anywhere in the world, and physical landmarks in the world. Keep the articles in a folder, big envelope or plastic sleeve - for use in Unit 3. BRIGHT IDEA! Internet resources for latitude and longitude A lot of material about latitude and longitude on the Internet is directly relevant to teaching these topics and exploring them in a learning environment. Here is a selection of sites with material that you may find useful. http://www.google.co.za/images Type: 'latitude and longitude worksheets' in the space bar Lots of illustrated material - maps of all types - and worksheet resources for teaching this topic. http://www.worldatlas.com/aatlas/latitude_and_longitude_finder.htm Type the name of any address, city, country, province, state or code and find its latitude and longitude. http://www.world-gazetteer.com/wg.php?x=&men=gcis&lng=en&des=wg&srt=npan&col=abcdefghinoq&msz=1500 Lists the latitude and longitude of the largest cities and towns in the world. http://www.ait.net/lessons/SocialStudies_4.pdf Interesting and detailed lesson plans for exploring magnetic fields, co-ordinates and map grids.

Decide whether the class will draw a chair or a table so that all learners are dealing with the same object. Make sure everyone can see the table or chair from where they are sitting. Allow 3 minutes for learners to do the drawing in their notebooks.1. Use only a pencil to draw the chair/table. You may not use an eraser or a ruler. Ask learners to hold up their drawings for a short while so that you and other lear ners can see and comment on the drawings. 2. Then discuss the questions as a class: - Did you get the proportions correct? (The siz es of the different parts of the chair or table.) - What did you find easy? - What did you find difficult? - What methods or tools would help you to draw accurately? After the discussion, ask learners to quietly read the text on Learner's Book page 16, and then talk about the information as a class - for example, ask questions to check learners' understanding, and encourage questions from learners. Using the text and pictures on Learner's Book pages 17-18, along with information from the Bright Idea! for this Unit, explain the different types of map scales and give more examples (e.g. using the classroom wall map, or maps in an atlas). Ask learners to read the Activity on Learner's Book page 18 and then put up their hands if they know the answers. Discuss the answers as a class and make sure that everyone understands the concept of scale. Ask learners to work on their own to read the text and complete the Activities on Learner's Book page 19 in their notebooks. Unit 12Unit Scale Learner's Book pages 16-23 4 hours9 Please note that in some editions of the Learner's Book the paragraph between the two Activities on page 19 has incorrect information. The last two sentences should read: \"The map of the world on pages 180-181 has a scale of 1:100 000 000. Every 1 cm on the map at the equator is 100 000 000 cm in real life, or 1 000 km.\" The size of the map on page 180-181 and its line scale were corrected in the latest (2020) edition. Informally assessing the Individual Activities from Learner's Book pages 19, 22 and 23 will help you to identify learners who are struggling with the concepts in this Module (take in the notebooks for marking at the end of the Unit). Ask learners to work in pairs to read the text and do the Activities on Learner's Book pages 20-21. Go around the class to help and assess pairs informally while they are working. As a class, share the answers to the questions in the Pair Activities - ask for volunteers from the pairs to share their answers. After the discussion, read through the Activities on Learner's Book pages 22 and 23 and check that everyone understands what they need to do. Then ask learners to work on their own to complete the Activities in their notebooks, and then hand in their notebooks for informal assessment. Please note: Ask learners to look for and bring newspaper articles about: places in your province, other South African provinces, African countries, cities anywhere in the world, and physical landmarks in the world. (These will be used in the next unit.) BRIGHT IDEA! Map scale and measuring distance A map is a visual representation of a much larger area of land. In order to be useful, a map must be small enough to be handled by a person. Imagine drawing a map of the Earth that was full-size. Of course that is ridiculous! A full-size map of the Earth would not only be too large to be useful, but it would also be impractical to make. Maps are scaled down so that they fit on the available paper or screen. When scaling down a map, every part of the map is scaled by the same amount. This ensures that every object on the map is the same proportion as everything else on the map. If a city is twice as large as a neighbouring town, an accurate scaled map will show the same relationship on paper. The drawn city will be twice as large as the drawn town. Because the Earth is round, and maps are flat, it is impossible to create a map with a perfect scale. Some parts of the map will be too large, while others will be too small. The larger a territory shown on a map, the greater the distortions in scale will be. It is important that we recognise how to read, understand, and use scale on different maps. There are three common methods used by map makers to depict scale. These methods are referred to as the graphic method (graphic or line scale), the verbal method (word statement), and the ratio or fractional method. A graphic or line scale shows scale using a line, with separations marked by smaller intersecting lines, similar to a ruler. One side of the scale ! UNIT 2 MODULE 110 UNIT 2 MODULE 1Answers to activities Individual and Class Learner's Book page 16 1. and 2. Some learners might find this Activity difficult and their drawings may not look very much like the table/chair. Share with the whole class any drawings showing good examples of correct proportions (or perspective). The challenge of this Activity is to draw the table or chair to scale so that although it is smaller and on a flat piece of paper, its size and proportions (parts) are true to real life. Methods or tools to help more accurate drawing to scale include: a ruler, a tape measure, a piece of string, and engineering surveying instruments and tools. Individual Learner's Book page 181. Africa is bigger than North America and South America. 2. China is bigger - by land area only (if you add water surface area to land area then the USA is slightly bigger than China). I ndividual Learner's Book page 19 1. 1 cm represents 1 km1 cm represents 5 km1 cm represents 100 km1 cm r epresents 10 000 kmrepresents the distance on the map, while the other side represents the true distances of objects in real life. By measuring the distance between two objects on a map, and then referring to the graphic scale, it is easy to calculate the actual distance between those same items. A word scale gives a written description of map distance, such as 'One centimetre equals one kilometre' or 'One centimetre equals ten kilometres'. The verbal method of depicting scale simply uses words to describe the ratio between the map's scale and the real world. Calculating scale on a map using the verbal method is easy. Measure the distance on the map, and then follow the verbal directions to calculate the actual distance. The fractional method for showing the scale of a map uses a representative fraction or ratio to describe how many units on the earth's surface is equal to one unit on the map. This can be shown as 1:50 000 or 1/50 000. In this example 1 unit of distance on the map represents 50 000 of the same units of distance in the real world. This means that 1 cm on the map represents 50 000 centimetres in the real world, and 1 m on the map represents 50 000 metres on the map, etc. Maps are often known as large scale or small scale. A map that depicts a small territory is referred to as a large scale map. This is because the area of land being represented by the map has been scaled down less, or in other words, the scale is larger. A large scale map only shows a small area, but it shows it in great detail. A map depicting a large area, such as an entire country, is considered a small scale map. In order to show the entire country the map must be scaled down until it is much smaller. A small scale map shows more territory, but it is less detailed.

Use maps from the Learner's Book, atlases, the classroom wall maps, and maps from magazines, newspapers and the Internet. Give learners 2 points on each map and tell them they need to work out the distance between the 2 points using the map's scale and their rulers. You need to measure and calculate the distances between points before the learners - so that Informal assessment Informally assessing the Individual Activities from Learner's Book pages 19, 22 and 23 will help you to get a good sense of how each learner is coping with the content and concepts covered so far.13 UNIT 3 MODULE 1Unit 13Unit Information from atlases Learner's Book pages 24-31 4 hours you know the answers, but also so that you can help learners with measuring. For extension learners you can expand the exercise of measuring by asking them to plan a road trip by working out the distances between stops, and the total distance. For example, if they're going to drive from Cape Town to Cairo - they need to calculate the distances between the cities/towns where they will stop (they must stop driving every night); they also need to find out the co-ordinates of all the places where they will stop, and the total kilometres travelled in a one-way trip. Curriculum content and concepts Atlases, global statistics and current events Kinds of information provided in an atlas How the content page of an atlas is organised Own province in an atlas: What information can a map give about a (population)/largest countries (area) Locate major current events or places in the news on a map (ongoing throughout the year) Teaching notes You will need: atlases By this stage of Social Sciences learners should be familiar with atlases, but if they are not, this Unit will introduce them to the details of using an atlas and the types of information in an atlas. If learners are already working with atlases this Unit will be a useful consolidation and practice of that work. Show learners the contents of the atlas used by the class - that is, the contents page/s, the different types of information/maps in the atlas, and the index pages. This should be a book that learners feel confident about using for their learning and assessment. Ask learners to work in pairs to read through the text on Learner's Book page 24 and do Questions 1 and 2 of the Activity on page 25 in their notebooks. Learners should then work on their own to write the answers to Question 3 of the Activity, and then swap notebooks with another learner for pair marking. Ask for volunteers to share their answers for questions 1-3 with the class so that all learners can check their answers.14 UNIT 3 MODULE 1 Ask learners to work in pairs for the Activity on Learner's Book page 26, and then to join with another pair to swap books and mark each other's answers using the filled-in table (Extra resources, Greatest features table). Ask learners to work on their own for Question 1 of the Activity on Learner's Book page 30, using a classroom atlas and writing the answers in their notebooks. For Question 2 of the Activity on Learner's Book page 30, ask learners to work in groups of 3-5 to share newspaper articles to find and note places. Remind learners to write which articles they used as their sources for answering the questions. For Question 3 of the Activity on Learner's Book page 30, spend some time working with each of the groups to find the places in the class atlases. Ask groups to put up the newspaper articles on the classroom wall as a resource for reading; ask learners to bring more articles on similar topics during the rest of the term. Finally, read the text on Learner's Book page 31 and talk about what is possible today in terms of global air travel. If you have brochures and pamphlets from a travel agent, ask the groups to share and look at these resources. Ask learners to work in pairs to complete the Activity on Learner's Book page 31, in their notebooks. Take in the notebooks for informal assessment when the pairs have completed the Activity.

You will need to use the class atlas or wall map to find examples of places in Question 1. The map on pages 180-181 of the Learner's Book is also useful. H elp individual learners while they are working if they are struggling - this is a good opportunity for informal assessment of learners' map skills. You can also pair achieving learners with learners who are struggling with map work so that the stronger learners can help (peer teach) other learners (not do the work for them, but support in the steps of finding the answer). Group Learner's Book page 302. Before learners work with the newspaper articles y ou should have a look through them to find and note examples of places - as asked in Question 2 of the Activity. When the groups are working with the articles spend some time with each group, checking that they are finding the correct information. 3. Use the class atlas to find and note a few examples for Question 3. Check that the groups are responding correctly to the question. Pair Learner's Book page 31 This is a creative and interesting Activity. Learners should work in pairs to plan their trip and agree on the cities and countries they will visit, and then each draws the outline map in their notebooks, showing the route.

Ask learners to follow in their books while you read the text and talk about the pictures on Learner' s Book page 36. Check learners' understanding: trade is the exchange of something for something else; it can involve exchanging goods, or goods for money, or other forms of currency that have value. Ask learners to work on their own to complete the Activity on Learner's Book page 37, writing the answers in their notebooks. Then ask learners to work in pairs to compare and discuss answers. As a class, take turns to read aloud the text on Learner's Book page 38 and the picture captions on the map of South Africa on Learner's Book page 39. Check that learners understand the concepts on these pages by asking questions based on the reading and encouraging learners to ask questions. Put the class into groups of 5 for the Activity on Learner's Book page 38. Give learners 20-25 minutes to play the game, and then discuss Question 5 as a class. Ask learners to work in pairs to do the Activity on Learner's Book page 39, and to write the answers in their notebooks. When the pairs have finished take in the notebooks for informal assessment of this Activity and the Individual Activity on Learner's Book page 37. The text in the Bright Idea! links to History that learners learned in Grade 5, and also links to a topic (M odule) in Grade 6. Read and explain the Bright Idea! text to learners to reinforce or extend content in both Geography and History. Ask learners what they would choose as money - what thing/s would they choose to value and exchange - if they were living in Iron Age Africa, and why.20 UNIT 1 MODULE 2BRIGHT IDEA! Trade in early African history Before the Iron Age in southern Africa most people were nomadic and survived by hunting wild animals and gathering wild plants. Most chiefdoms were small in size and people did not regard land as property. This resulted in fairly harmonious co-existence as no tribe needed to be or was sufficiently more powerful to conquer another. Food and water were readily available and people simply followed the animals they hunted as the seasons changed. This made the nomadic life more practical than settling in one place. Around 10 000 years ago, in different parts of the world, people began domesticating animals and plants. These were the first agricultural skills developed by our ancestors. They no longer had to rely on the availability of wild animals or plants but they could produce their own food. Farming allowed people to settle in towns. As towns grew and developed, society became more complex, paving the way for more sophisticated administration and politics. Now that communities could cultivate plant crops and raise livestock, especially cattle, they sometimes had too much of both. This surplus became the object of trade. Groups began to exchange their products for goods they couldn't produce themselves. Trade routes were established and ivory and gold from Africa was traded for cloth, glass beads and other luxury products from afar. Iron Age technology was transmitted across Africa by Bantu-speaking people who migrated to the south from North and Central Africa. Their language and culture mixed with those of the groups they met, which is why many African people are Bantu-speaking. They also brought iron smelting technology and agriculture to these groups and founded great kingdoms like Great Zimbabwe, Mapungubwe and Thulamela. Thulamela is in the north-eastern part of South Africa near the South African border with Zimbabwe and Mozambique in Limpopo Province. This area is also known as the Pafuri area of the Kruger National Park and is next to the Levuvhu River, which flows into the Limpopo River. The kingdom existed between about 1240 ACE and 1700 ACE. Scientists believe that the ancestors of the Shona people established Thulamela. The Shona people initially practised agriculture and bred animals, especially cattle, to make a living. During the 14th century, or the 1300s, they began trading gold and ivory with Arab and, after them, Portuguese traders along the eastern coast of Africa. Archaeologists discovered gold beads, gold wire, gongs and a potsherd with traces of molten gold at Thulamela. There were also forged tools and weapons, which show that they had begun to extract and use metals around 800 years ago, and had converted them to steel without any European influence. Like all other cities, Thulamela's rubbish dump tells a great deal about the people who lived there. Archaeologists found gold jewellery, iron tools, ceramic potsherds, glass beads, spinning whorls, sewing needles and a piece of Chinese porcelain. This shows that metal was smelted, which means they had advanced technology and trade contacts with the Far East.

Reading If learners complete the Activities and there is still lesson time, ask them to read more information about any of the topics on the Module. See Additional resources in this Unit for relevant websites about raw materials, manufacturing, trade and industry in South Africa - use articles from these sites for further reading for learners. Set up a reading corner of trade and business magazines, where learners can borrow a magazine for extra reading. There are also 2 suggested children's books in Additional resources which are good, interesting reading with lots of illustrations. The books cover economic topics in an accessible way, and give insight into how people work and live around the world. If you can't get any of the above resources then ask learners to read ahead in their Learner's Books.! Answers to activities Individual Learner's Book page 40 1. A. Primary products B.

They should remember examples of ' natural resources' from Grade 5. In this Unit you'll develop the concept of 'resources' - the value of resources and how a money value is worked out for a resource or product. Read through Learner's Book pages 42-43 while learners follow in their books. Write key words and terms on the board, for example: - The value of something is the price or money that is paid for that thing. - Secondary products have more v alue (cost more). - The producer's profit is the money made after production costs ar e paid. - Retailer's profit is the final seller' s profit (e.g. the shop owner). Discuss the costs of making bread (Learner's Book page 42) with the class - write the costs on the board. Ask learners to think of reasons for and against making one's own bread at home. How much money could someone save if they bought flour and made their own bread? What would happen if everyone started making their own bread and no one bought bread from shops? Read the text on Learner's Book page 44 'How is chocolate manufactur ed?' and ask for volunteers to read each caption in the flow chart 'From cocoa to chocolate' on Learner's Book pages 44-45. Check learners' understanding of 'primary' and 'secondary' products. Ask learners to work in pairs to complete the Activity on Learner's Book page 43 in their notebooks, and then work on their own to complete the Activity on Learner's Book page 45 in their notebooks. When everyone has completed the Activities ask for volunteers to read their answers to the class for discussion and marking. Ask learners to work on their own to read the information and look at the pictures on Learner's Book page 46, and then complete the Activity (gold mind-map) in their notebooks. For extra information for the mind-map, ask learners to listen carefully 25 UNIT 3 MODULE 2while you read the texts from Bright Idea! Write key words and terms from the texts on the board. Take in the notebooks at the end of the Unit for informal assessment. BRIGHT IDEA! Gold mining Gold mining involves the removal of gold from deep in the ground. The known history of gold mining goes back as far as the 4 th millennium BCE. During the Bronze Age, the use of gold steadily increased as it was found to be soft and easy to work with. Gold rushes around the world in the 1800s saw the start of regions such as California, Victoria in Australia and the Transvaal in South Africa as thousands of wealth seekers were lured into shanty towns. Most gold rushes weren't sustained and many areas were left empty as the illusion of quick money wore off. The formalised gold mining sector then took control and regulated the gold mining in South Africa. Today, companies like Anglo American, Harmony Gold and BHP Billiton are established as industry managers of gold mining in South Africa. There are several methods and processes that are used to extract gold from the earth. Gold mining in South Africa typically involves methods such as panning, sluicing, dredging, hard rock mining and by-product mining. For most effective gold mining in South Africa, the method used is hard rock mining, since gold reserves are usually within rock deep underground. The invention of industrial air cooling and air quality control systems saw gold mines reach new depths - the deepest being 3 900 metres. Over 50 % of all gold reserves are found in South Africa, where the Witwatersrand holds the world's largest gold reef deposit. Gold mining in South Africa employs more than 200 000 people and earns tens of billions of Rands in foreign currency earnings. Source: http://www.projectsiq.com/gold-mining-in-south-africa.htm (extracted and adapted)The many uses of gold The production of ornamental objects (for decoration) was probably the first use of gold over 6 000 years ago. Gold is found in the pure state, is very easy to work and was probably the first metal used by humans. Today, most of the gold that is newly mined or recycled is used in the manufacture of jewellery. About 78 % of the gold used each year is used in the manufacture of jewellery. Because gold is highly valued and in very limited supply it has long been used as a medium of exchange or money. The first known use of gold in transactions dates back about 6 000 years. Early transactions were done using pieces of gold or pieces of silver. The rarity, usefulness and desirability of gold make it a substance of long-term value. Gold works well for this purpose because it has a high value, and is durable, portable and easily divisible. The first gold coins were minted in Turkey in about 560 BCE. Gold coins were commonly used in transactions up to the early 1900s, when paper currency became a more common form of exchange. Today gold coins are no longer in general use for financial transactions. The most important industrial use of gold is in the manufacture of electronics. Gold is a highly efficient conductor that can carry tiny currents !26 UNIT 3 MODULE 2Answers to activities Pair Learner's Book page 43 1. a) fruit b) jam c) selling jam 2. Jam is a secondary product that costs more to make and to buy than fruit (primary pr oduct) because it goes through a manufacturing process. Each stage of the manufacturing process adds value to the product. 3. For example: flour (primary product) > bread (secondary pr oduct) > selling bread For example: wood (primary) > paper (secondary) > selling book For example: milk (primary) > cheese (secondary) > selling cheese For example: herbs (primary) > dried herbs (secondary) > selling dried herbs For example: denim material (primary) > jeans > selling jeans Individual Learner' s Book page 45 1. Primary products: Cocoa beans - the main producers of coca beans today include: Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana, N igeria, Cameroon, Brazil, Ecuador and Indonesia. Cocoa is one of the most important crops in West and Central Africa - about 70 % of the world's total supply of cocoa beans comes from these regions. Sugarcane - the main producers of sugarcane today include Brazil, India, China, Thailand, Pakistan, Mexico and Columbia. Milk - New Zealand, Australia and European Union countries (especially northern Europe) are the 3 largest exporters of milk. Nuts - North America and United Kingdom. 2. a) Primary products: cocoa beans, sugarcane, milk and nuts. Secondary pr oducts: cocoa butter, sugar, processed milk b) (Packaging) Primary products: aluminium, wood. Secondary pr oducts: aluminium foil, paper Individual Learner's Book page 461. to 2. Learners should be familiar with creating mind-maps from Grade 5. They should be able to create at least 3 points (lines) off each question in the mind-map on Learner's Book page 46 - each and remain free of corrosion. Electronic components made with gold are highly reliable. Gold is used in connectors, switch and relay contacts, soldered joints, connecting wires and connection strips. A tiny amount of gold is used in almost every sophisticated electronic device. This includes: cell phones, calculators, Global Positioning System (GPS) units and other small electronic devices. Gold is also used in many places in the standard desktop or laptop computer. Most large electronic appliances such as television sets also contain a very small amount of gold. Gold is a very efficient and reliable conductor, better than any other metal. The high quality and reliable performance justifies the high cost.

Using the information in the Learner's Book and Bright Ideas!, as well as learning from History, learners should be able to add more details to their mind-maps - e.g. add more sub-topics and lines or branches from the sub-topics, and/or add more questions. The mind-map should take up 1-2 pages of the notebook - encourage learners to try to use as much of the space as possible. Informal assessment Monitor progress in discussion and Activities.

They can choose any jewellery, for example, ring, earrings, beads, bangles, etc. The flow chart should explain the process of getting and using gold to making a piece of jewellery that is ready for sale. For example: First point: 'Gold in the ground is extracted as ore.' To the last point: 'The gold (rings/beads/earrings) are transported to jewellery shops for sale.' The groups should try to think as many possible stages in the flow chart as possible, and then draw their flow chart on a large piece of paper (e.g. a two-page spread in the notebook). Give learners 20 minutes to do the gold flow chart task, and then ask groups to share answers as a class - write the best/combined flow chart on the board.28 UNIT 4 MODULE 2Unit 14Unit Fair trading Learner's Book pages 48-51 4 hours Curriculum content and concepts Concepts of 'unfair trade' and 'fair trade' The human cost of unfair trade - work and exploitation Fair trade - case study of a positive project Teaching notes You will need: A3 sheets of paper for learners' posters (1 piece of paper per group of 4) This Unit strongly reinforces the Geography curriculum aim: 'develop learners who care about their planet and the well-being of all who live in it'. Ask learners to read the information on Learner's Book page 48 and then as a class discuss what they know about work and exploitation. Ask them questions. Point out the Flash Facts box. Read the caption under the photograph. It is important to know the difference between child labour that exploits children and work that does them no harm. Some types of work are not acceptable for children. Child labour is illegal under 15 years. Child work at any age is wrong when:- The child is too young for the job - The job is unsafe or harmful - It stops the child from going to school - It takes the child away from her or his family - The child is forced to work - The pay is unfair - The child is treated unfairly Introduce and talk about the Fairtrade organisation and Fairtrade label or logo (Learner's Book page 49), then ask learners to work in groups of 5 to read the information on Learner's Book page 49 and do the Activity. Go around to groups while they are discussing to help and informally assess. You will need the A3 sheets of paper for the groups to draw their posters for the Activity. Remind the groups to first design the poster on another piece of paper. If learners have pencil crayons, kokis and crayons they should colour their posters. Ask groups to put up their posters on the classroom walls; the class should decide which 2 posters are most effective. Ask for someone from each group to read their list (Question 2 of the Activity on Learner's Book page 49) to the class. Write the common points on the board. Read the information in the textbox (Learner's Book page 50) aloud to learners. Ask them to tell you, without looking at their books, who the main people or groups are that are involved in 29 UNIT 4 MODULE 2making a bar of chocolate; then they can check Learner's Book page 50 for the answers. Ask learners to work in pairs for the Activity on Learner's Book page 50: Question 1: drawing the chocolate bar, Question 2: 'dividing it up' (using the list in the Learner's Book), reading Question 3, and then joining another pair to discuss the Group question. Ask the groups to report back to the class about their discussion, and as a class discuss the question to decide what most learners feel about the question of fairness. Next, ask learners to work quietly to read the information on Learner's Book page 51 and think about the question in the Activity. Then discuss the Activity as a class: ask learners to give examples and talk about how cocoa farmers have benefited from fair trading - how Fairtrade has made a difference to their lives. BRIGHT IDEA! Ask learners to look out for the Fairtrade label or logo on products at supermarkets and health shops.The Fairtrade Label The FAIRTRADE label or logo (on Learner's Book page 49) is now the most widely recognised and trusted ethical label in the world. When a product carries the Fairtrade Label, it means that both producers and traders have met Fairtrade Standards and that they are audited annually to ensure compliance. The symbol in the Fairtrade Label shows a person with a raised arm representing the optimism of producers. The blue sky of potential is connected to the green of growth. Fairtrade is an alternative approach to conventional trade and a global movement that stands for sustainability and development through trade. Dating back to the 1960s, Fairtrade started with small initiatives by individuals or groups (usually faith-based organisations or social entrepreneurs) that wanted to make a difference in developing countries by buying their products in an ethical manner. This included paying fairer prices and establishing direct trading partnerships with producers, therefore sharing knowledge and information on production and market and quality requirements. Now Fairtrade has become the leading certification system for sustainability and poverty alleviation. There are thousands of Fairtrade certified companies in the world (producer organisations, manufacturers and traders) that make a difference every day through Fairtrade trading. Fairtrade creates more opportunities for those farming communities who have been economically disadvantaged or marginalised by the conventional trading system. Fairtrade benefits small-scale farmers and farm workers by: ensuring better trading, working and living conditions through Fairtrade Standards providing a Fairtrade Premium that small-scale farmers (in the case of a co-operative) and farm workers (in the case of a commercial farm) can invest in projects to improve their lives supporting sustainable production and protection of the environment for a better future.!30 UNIT 4 MODULE 2Answers to activities Group Learner's Book page 49 1. Learners should have quite a few ideas and opinions in response to this question. Remind learners to support their opinions with r easons and examples. Workers need to be protected from exploitation because unfortunately there are people and companies who will exploit them, especially workers in poorer countries. When workers are exploited the company may make more profit, but the worker and her or his family suffer from the unfair trade relationship. 2. List should include: Assists farmers in getting better trading and working conditions. Assists farmers by setting up co-operatives. Lobbies for companies to pay better prices, and to always pay at least market price. Allows a company to use the Fairtrade logo if that company meets certain requirements, e.g. ethical treatment of workers. 3. This should be a creative and fun task, and the results should be colourful posters with a message and the Fairtr ade logo - posters which motivate people to buy Fairtrade products. Pair Learner's Book page 501. to 2. Learners have 20 squares, and 5 groups to give pieces of chocolate to. They should decide how the chocolate pieces should be divided amongst the 5 groups/people involved in making a bar of chocolate: farmers, government of the country where the farmers farm, company that makes chocolate, shop owner who sells chocolate, government of the country where the chocolate is sold. Ask each pair to draw squares in their notebooks to show how many pieces they think should go to each group. 3. Reading information and data handling. Group Learner' s Book page 50 Learners should be able to support or motivate their answers to 'why or why not?' with information and examples.

Here the focus is on understanding climate variation and on reading and cross-referencing information on different maps. Start this Module with the Pair Activity ' What do you know already?' on Learner's Book page 55. Write the following words on the board to help learners: overcast, scorching, fine, cloudy, wet and windy; ask for volunteers to give more words about the weather - add them to your list on the board. Ask the pairs to write the weather words in their notebooks, and then talk about the questions in the Activity. As a class, briefly review and discuss the questions from 'What do you kno w already?' on Learner's Book page 55. This will give you a good indication of what learners know and remember about weather, climate and vegetation from Grade 5. This Unit should not be difficult or challenging for learners if they achieved the content and skills for Geography in Grade 5. Ask for volunteers to explain the difference between weather and climate; write the definition of each word on the board. Ask learners to work in groups to read the information on Learner's Book page 56 and then complete the Activity on the same page. Learners should stay in their groups to continue reading about 'Seasons' on Learner's Book page 57, and then work on their own to do the Activity on the same page. Draw the table from Learner's Book page 56 on the board and ask for volunteers to fill in the correct answers. Guide learners in marking their own work. Then discuss the pictures and questions on Learner's Book page 57. Ask learners to put their winter and summer pictures on the classroom wall, and talk about the pictures and captions with the class. (If you can't get unlined white paper for the drawings, ask learners to carefully cut out 2 pages from their notebooks.)34 UNIT 1 MODULE 3BRIGHT IDEA! Weather and Climate Q & A What is the difference between weather and climate?Climate is the average weather for a particular region and time period (usually taken over a 30-year period). Climate is not the same as weather; rather, it is the average pattern of weather for a particular region. Weather describes the short-term state of the atmosphere. The weather is just the state of the atmosphere at any time, including things such as temperature, precipitation, air pressure and cloud cover. Daily changes in the weather are due to winds and storms. Seasonal changes are due to the Earth rotating around the sun. What causes weather? Because the Earth is round and not flat, the Sun's rays don't fall evenly on the land and oceans. The Sun shines more directly near the equator, bringing these areas more warmth. However, the polar regions are at such an angle to the Sun that they get little or no sunlight during the winter, causing colder temperatures. These differences in temperature create a restless movement of air and water in great swirling currents that distribute heat energy from the Sun across the planet. When air in one region is warmer than the surrounding air, it becomes less dense and begins to rise, drawing more air in underneath. Elsewhere, cooler denser air sinks, pushing air outward to flow along the surface and complete the cycle. Why do mountains affect weather and climate? There are two sides to a mountain: wayward and leeward. When it rains, the wayward side gets the rain. As a cloud goes up the mountain, it keeps raining until there is no more water in the cloud. Now, as the cloud starts to go down the other side of the mountain, there is no more precipitation, so the leeward side of the mountain doesn't get any rain. The flat ground on this side of the mountain is dry. What is climate change? Climate change is a change in long-term weather patterns. They can become warmer or colder. Annual amounts of rainfall or snowfall can increase or decrease. What is global warming? Global warming refers to an average increase in the Earth's temperature, which in turn causes changes in climate. A warmer Earth may lead to changes in rainfall patterns, a rise in sea level, and a wide range of impacts ! Ask learners to follow in their books while you read aloud and explain Learner's Book pages 58-59, including the pictures, captions and maps. Ask learners to work on their own to complete the Activity on Learner's Book page 59 in their notebooks; then to read the text and look at the map on Learner's Book page 60; and finally to complete the Activity on Learner's Book page 61 in their notebooks. Take in the notebooks for informal assessment, especially of these last 2 Activities. See Additional resources for this Unit for lots of ideas for extra resources for learners to read, watch and look at.35 UNIT 1 MODULE 3Answers to activities Group Learner's Book page 56 1. on plants, wildlife, and humans. When scientists talk about the issue of climate change, their concern is about global warming caused by human activities. What is the greenhouse effect? The greenhouse effect is the rise in temperature that the Earth experiences because certain gases in the atmosphere like water vapour, carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide and methane trap energy from the sun. Without these gases, heat would escape back into space and the Earth's average temperature would not be warm enough for humans to live. But if the greenhouse effect becomes stronger, it could make the Earth warmer than usual. What is El Ni\u00f1o? El Ni\u00f1o is a climate pattern where the water in the Pacific Ocean near the equator gets hotter than usual and affects the atmosphere and weather around the world. El Ni\u00f1o climate conditions occur every few years, and they are not predictable. El Ni\u00f1o is Spanish for 'the little boy'. What is La Ni\u00f1a? La Ni\u00f1a is the opposite of El Ni\u00f1o. During a La Ni\u00f1a, the water in the same area along the equator gets colder than usual. This, too, affects weather around the globe. According to scientists, La Ni\u00f1a cycles generally create a more active hurricane season in the Atlantic. La Ni\u00f1a is Spanish for 'the little girl'. Where does the wind blow the most ... and the least? The windiest place on Earth is Port Martin, in Antarctica. Here winds average more than 64 km per hour on at least 100 days every year. The place with the least wind is also in Antarctica, at a site called Dome A. Here the wind hardly blows at all. This shows how Antarctica is a place of extremes. Where is weather recorded? Weather stations are found all over the world. The highest one on land is on Mount Everest. Sitting nearly 8 000 m up the mountain, the equipment measures temperature, wind speed and air pressure.

In this Unit you'll explore the region of tropical rainforests. Ask learners to tell you what they already know about rainforests. Ask learners to look at the map on Learner's Book page 62 and tell you where rainforest regions are found in the world. Talk about the climate in rainforests. Ask learners to work on their own to read the information and do the Activities on Learner's Book pages 63-64, writing the answers in their notebooks. When learners have completed the work, discuss the answers as a class. These Activities, and the Activity on Learner's Book page 67, will be useful for informal assessment - identify and help any learners who are struggling with map work and/or data handling. Ask learners to work in pairs to read the information and complete the Activity on Learner's Book page 65 (in their notebooks), and then team up with another pair to compare answers. Ask for learners to each read a sentence on Learner's Book page 66 aloud, moving around the class so that everyone gets a chance to read at least 1 sentence. After the reading is complete, go back and talk about the 3 questions in the boxes (Learner's Book page 66). Ask learners to work on their own for the last Activity of the Unit (Learner's Book page 67), writing the answers in their notebooks. Take in the notebooks for informal assessment. Note that: Deforested regions often suffer from soil erosion and then degrade into wastelands. The removal of trees without sufficient reforestation results in damage to the habitat and loss of biodiversity. The deforestation of tropical rainforests results in the loss of species of plants and animals, and it affects the world's climate negatively.38 UNIT 2 MODULE 3BRIGHT IDEA! What is a rainforest? Rainforests are defined and created by rainfall - about 175 cm to 200 cm (2 m) of rainfall per year. You'll find rainforests in the Amazon Basin; the Congo Basin of equatorial Africa; the East Indies; and from Sumatra to New Guinea. Rainforests are found in both tropical and temperate regions - as long as there is enough rain - although there aren't many temperate rainforests. Rainforests are never found in climates which have temperatures 0 \u00b0C and below - the plant life will not be able to live because they aren't adapted to frost. All the plants will die out if the rainforest is cooler. Hot and wet rainforest climate is found mostly near the equator. The closer to the equator you are, the more solar radiation there is. The more solar radiation there is, the hotter it is. Because of the ample solar energy, tropical rainforests are usually warm year round with temperatures of about 22-34 \u00b0C, although forests at higher elevations, especially cloud forests, may be significantly cooler. The temperature may fluctuate during the year, but in some equatorial forests the average may vary as little as 0.3 \u00b0C throughout the year. Temperatures are generally moderated by cloud cover and high humidity. The main plants in this biome are trees. A lot of the rain that falls on the rainforest never reaches the ground. It stays on the trees because the leaves act as a shield, and never gets past the trees to the smaller plants and grounds below. Trees in this climate can reach a height of more than 50 m. The moisture of the rainforest from rainfall, constant cloud cover, and transpiration (water loss through leaves) creates intense local humidity. Large rainforests (and their humidity) contribute to the formation of rain clouds, and generate as much as 75 % of their own rain. The Amazon rainforest is responsible for creating as much as 50 % of its own precipitation. Deforestation and climate change may be affecting the water cycle in tropical rainforests. Since the mid-1990s, rainforests around the world have experienced periods of severe drought, including south-east Asia in 1997 and 2005 , and the Amazon in 2005. Dry conditions, combined with degradation from logging and agricultural conversion, make forests more vulnerable to wildfire . Most of Africa's remaining rainforests are found in the Congo River Basin on the Atlantic Ocean side of the continent. Rainforests in the Congo are mostly under threat from logging, subsistence activities like small-scale agriculture and firewood collection, and commercial agriculture, including large plantations. Wildlife - gorillas, chimpanzees and elephants - is endangered from hunting.

Ask learners to write each sub-heading (e.g. 'Differences between weather and climate', 'Seasons', 'Hot, mild and cold climates', etc.) and underneath the heading to write 2-4 key words or sentences from the text. Extension learners: Ask extension learners to find out and write two paragraphs about each term: 'reforestation' - what is it, where has it been done, and what are the successes? 'desertification'- what is it, where has it happened/is it happening, and why is it a problem?41 UNIT 3 MODULE 3Unit 13Unit Hot deserts Learner's Book pages 68-71 3 hours Curriculum content and concepts Location on Earth Climate: temperature and rainfall patterns (monthly averages) Natural vegetation and wildlife in a desert How people live in a desert - examples of lifestyles Teaching notes You will need: pictures of vegetation, animals and people living in a desert region, and atlases One of the main criteria for an area to be classified as 'a desert' is that it must have less than 25 cm of rainfall per year (there are also other factors that define a desert). Briefly introduce the idea that deserts can be hot or cold. Cold deserts can be covered in snow or ice - frozen water which is unavailable to plant life. Based only on the criterion of having less than 25 cm of rain annually, the continent of Antarctica is actually the largest desert on Earth. It has less than 51 mm of rain per year and little or no vegetation. There are barren rock fields in Antarctica that don't even get snow, even though they're very cold. The Arctic Desert is the second largest desert in the world. These are polar deserts. The Sahara is the world's third largest desert, and the largest hot desert. This Unit looks at hot desert regions. Use the Individual Activities in this Unit for informal assessment of learners' progress in the Module. Ask learners to work on their own to read Learner's Book pages 68-70, and write the answers to the Activities in their notebooks. This requires quiet focused work in class for individual reading, thinking and writing. Ask learners to swap notebooks and mark each other's work for the Activities on Learner's Book pages 68 and 69. Work through the questions for these Activities with the class, asking for volunteers to answer. Take in the notebooks to informally assess learners' achievement in the 4 Individual Activities for this Unit. Read the text from Bright Idea! aloud to the class. From what they have heard and read, ask learners to work in groups of 4-5 to talk about what it is like to live in a desert. Ask them to talk about aspects such as rain, sun, vegetation and living conditions. Ask learners to work in pairs to read the information on Learner's Book page 71, and to discuss the Activity on the same page. Give learners 15 minutes for this task, and then ask for volunteers to tell the class ways in which people have adapted to living in the desert. T ry to think of as many aspects as possible, for example: shelter, food and food preparation, clothing, protection from the extreme climate, and access to water. Make a list on the board.42 UNIT 3 MODULE 3BRIGHT IDEA! Timbuktu's climate change fight Farmers on the frontline of climate change around Timbuktu in northern Mali have been turning the desert green. Unpredictable rainfall and deforestation have seen the Sahara Desert encroach on the historic town over the last few years, but now irrigation projects are helping farmers to fight back. Timbuktu is fortunate to be just a few kilometres from the massive inland delta of the River Niger, and draws water from vast underground aquifers - bodies of permeable rock which transmit water. A women's co-operative in the village of Kabara, south of Timbuktu, is using these water sources to plant eucalyptus trees. They nurture them for two years, after which the trees can then survive almost without rain. In a region where the annual rainfall is less than 400 mm, reforestation is essential to put nutrients back into the soil, and to prevent erosion by the harsh desert winds. Windbreaks and vegetables Despite some scientists' concerns that eucalyptus trees can drain large amounts of water out of the soil, Daouda Diarra from the World Food Programme in Mali says they are a good choice in the desert environment. 'Eucalyptus is especially recommended for its rapid growth and the protection it gives against strong winds,' Mr Diarra says. 'In dry zones, a five-year-old tree's root system actually pumps water back into the water table.' The co-operative's president, Zeinabi Maiga, says they can now grow beans and other vegetables on land which was previously useless. 'Before the co-operative project started, our husbands were always away from home looking for work,' she says. 'But now they don't have to go because we can grow food here.' Mrs Maiga says there have been other benefits too: 'The men always used to take decisions for the family, now the women are also making a contribution.'

A tropical rainforest such as Madagascar has a wet, sunny climate and rich natural v egetation. This creates an environment able to provide enough water, food and shelter for many different species of plants and animals to grow and live. A desert environment has very little (or no) water, vegetation and shelter, and only a few plant and animal species have adapted to living in the harsh conditions. Pair Learner's Book page 71For example: People have a nomadic lifestyle so they can make the most of oases - i.e. travel to scattered water sources and trade sites. People live in tents, which provide coolth and shade, and which suit a nomadic lifestyle.44 UNIT 3 MODULE 3 People have domesticated camels, which are well suited to living in the desert, for transport.

Ask learners to listen carefully while you read the first paragraph on Learner's Book page 72 and point out the temperate forest regions on the map. Then ask the class to suggest answers to the key question: What climate and vegetation would you find in temperate coniferous forests? Discuss briefly as a class and write key words and phrases on the board. Ask learners to work on their own to complete the Activities on Learner's Book pages 72 and 73 in their notebooks. As soon as learners have completed the Activities on Learner's Book pages 72 and 73, ask them to quietly read the information on Learner's Book page 74 and look at the pictures on page 75. Ask learners what more they can now tell you about the climate and vegetation in a temperate coniferous forest - add more points to the list you wrote at the start of the Unit. Discuss the photographs on Learner's Book page 75 with the class. Ask learners to work on their own to complete the Activity on Learner's Book page 75 in their notebooks; they should write the number of each photograph and then the caption. Ask learners to swap notebooks to read each other's captions and discuss - do the captions fit the photographs? Take in the notebooks for marking and informal assessment. BRIGHT IDEA! Temperate coniferous forests The Earth's large forests of conifer trees extend mostly over the northern hemisphere, across North America, Europe and Asia. Trees that produce their seeds in cones, such as pine or fir trees, are most common in the coniferous forest. (Some hardy deciduous trees like birch are also mixed in.) These trees often have shallow roots that spread out widely to take advantage of the moisture in the upper levels !46 UNIT 4 MODULE 3Answers to activities Individual Learner's Book page 72 1. Temperate coniferous forests are found: in the Pacific Nor thwest (North America), South America, northwest Europe, southern Japan, and the eastern Black Sea-Caspian Sea region. Mostly near the latitude of the Arctic circle. 2. Average rainfall and temperatures for temperate coniferous forest regions Temperatures in January -40 \u00b0C to -20 \u00b0C Temperatures in July -20 \u00b0C to 0 \u00b0C Annual average rainfall >1 000 mmof the ground, which only thaws occasionally. The roots are also shallow because of the poor soil and rocky conditions. Trees in the coniferous forest primarily have needles instead of broad leaves. Needle leaves are an important adaptation to the extreme conditions present in the climate of the forest. Pine needles contain very little sap, so freezing is not much of a problem. Being dark in colour they absorb what little light falls on their surfaces. The vegetation is mostly trees such as fir, pine, redwood, yew and spruce; and some shrubs. Most animals are herbivores; however there are some carnivores and omnivores. Animals in coniferous forests include the red fox, moose, snowshoe hare, great horned owl and crossbill. The largest coniferous forest exists in Alaska, Canada, northern Europe and northern Asia, in a ring in the northern hemisphere. This forest is called the Taiga. Most of the world's commercial softwood timber, used for paper, comes from the Taiga. Threats to these forests Clearcut logging is the biggest threat to the coniferous forest. Replanting after logging leads to single-species conifer monoculture, which does not create much species biodiversity. This logging speeds up soil erosion, upsets wildlife habitats and leads to the loss of biodiversity. Mining operations are a threat to the coniferous forests because of the chemicals used in mining and the silt released by mining. Road construction destroys the forest and also acts as a barrier to wildlife. Roads isolate populations of species from feeding grounds and natural migration routes, and limits breeding between larger groups thus limiting the gene pool. As the Earth's population continues to increase and people continue to move out of the city and into the suburbs, more and more of these forests will be lost to urbanisation.

As long as learners have reasons for their choices, any answer is acceptable. They should also be able to recognise that different people have different reasons for their choices - this will come up in class discussion (learners will hear the different choices and reasons of their peers). Give learners 15 minutes for Pair discussion, and then talk about the questions as a class. Write the 3 key terms on the board, and ask learners to read out loud the definitions from Learner's Book page 80 - write them on the board. Explain the diagrams to learners. They can see population distribution shown on a map on Learner's Book pages 81 (South Africa) and 90 (the world). Talk about examples or issues related to the key terms. For example, ask learners to tell you whether they agree or disagreed with this statement, and why: 'An uneven population distribution in a country makes it difficult to distribute resources fairly and evenly.' They should give you reasons for their opinions and give examples if they can; they should also talk about ways in which resources can be distributed fairly and evenly. Talk about other examples or issues related to the key terms. For example, what areas in a country tend to have the biggest population size and density, and why? Ask learners to work in pairs to complete the Activities on Learner's Book page 80 and 81 in their notebooks - talking about the questions and then writing their answers. Ask each pair to swap books with another pair and mark their work while you talk through the answers to the Activities on Learner's Book pages 80-81. Ask for volunteers to read aloud sentences from Learner's Book page 82 'The provinces: Population size and density', and also to read the rows from the tables. Check learners' understanding by asking questions related to the information they have just read, for example, in the tables.

Write the 2 lists (provinces in order of area size and in order of population size) on the board or on large pieces of paper. Point out and talk about the map and table on Learner's Book page 84 to check learners' understanding. Ask learners to work on their own to complete the Activity on the same page, also in their notebooks. Take in the notebooks for informal assessment of progress in all the Activities, and to mark the final Activity. Ask if learners remember anything about the population census from 2011 - talk about this as a class. What is a population census? What information do we get from a population census? How is that information relevant to Social Sciences studies? (See also Bright Ideas! text below.) BRIGHT IDEA! What is a population census? A population census, as defined by the United Nations, is: 'the total process of collecting, compiling, evaluating, analysing and publishing [...] demographic, economic and social data pertaining, at a specified time, to all persons in a country or a well-defined part of the country'. A population census is the most complex and massive exercise a national statistical office undertakes. It requires mapping the entire country, mobilising and training a huge number of enumerators (counters - people who record information), conducting a comprehensive publicity campaign, canvassing all households to participate, collecting individual information, compiling vast amounts of completed questionnaires, and analysing and sharing the data. For many people, the census may be the only time that the state reaches them and asks them a question. A population census is typically held every 5 years, but because of a lack of capacity within Statistics South Africa, it was decided that the time will be extended to 10 years. A Community Survey was conducted in the place of the 2006 census.The importance of a population censusThe census plays an essential role in public administration. The results are used to ensure: fairness in distribution of government services; distributing and allocating government funds among regions and districts for education and health services; identifying electoral districts at national and local levels; and measuring the impact of industrial development. The census also provides the benchmark (reference point) for all surveys conducted by the national statistical office. Without the sampling frame !52 UNIT 1 MODULE 4obtained by the census, the national statistical system would face difficulties in providing reliable official statistics for use by government and the public. The census provides information on small areas and population groups with minimum sampling errors. This is important, for example, in planning the location of a school or clinic. Census information is also invaluable for use in the private sector for activities such as business planning and market analyses. The information is used as a benchmark in research and analysis.Historical backgroundPrior to the advent of democracy there was no reliable information available about the country as a whole. In 1996 the post-apartheid government conducted its first population census. This was followed by a census in 2001. The next census was scheduled for 2006, but because Statistics South Africa was not in a position to conduct a successful census, this was rescheduled for 2011. A Community Survey took the place of the 2006 census. The 2011 Census is the third census conducted by a democratic South African government and forms part of the 2010 round of African censuses, which aim to provide comprehensive data on the continent, for improved planning and to aid development.

Recreational places like beaches and parks are densely populated because people like places where they can relax and hav e fun. Shopping malls can also have a recreational purpose - for example, going to the movies or having a meal out; as well as a practical purpose - for example, shopping for groceries and things that are needed for the home. Beaches and shopping malls are places that attract people for many reasons, and so they are often crowded. 2. Places include: parks, fairs and markets, transport/stations, hospitals; and on a bigger scale, many urban areas (cities) ar e densely populated. 3. Places include: certain natural environments - for example, deserts, polar regions, rainfor ests, coniferous forests; and social environments - for example, places with low employment, places in economic recession, places without access to services and resources.

There are 2 reasons for this: A large part of the surface area of South Africa is not favourable for habitation because of the Kar oo and Kalahari deserts. Historically, settlements grew around trading posts and ports; around mineral deposits and mining; and anywhere that natural resources suppor ted settlement and growth. Some settlements grew vastly in wealth and size; as well as in density, and people came from rural areas in search of work. This leaves the rural areas much less densely populated.

Learners should remember information from Grades 4 and 5. Draw the following mind-map on the board (or on a large piece of paper) and add lines with key words and phrases from the class discussion, and also from Learner's Book pages 85 and 86. Ask learners to copy the mind-map in their notebooks. Climate Resources for human activities Note that while climate, water and mineral resources are not the only influences on global settlement, the strong influence of these factors should be noted on the world population distribution map. This should include cross-referencing with maps that show climate, physical features and mineral resources. Ask learners to work in pairs to complete the Activities on pages 85 and 86, in their notebooks. Each pair should then join with another pair to swap and mark work (peer assessment), and to agree on answers. You should go round to groups while they are working to guide the process and help with answers.Choosing a location for settlementVegetation Natural featuresLaws56 UNIT 2 MODULE 4 Then the groups should work together to read the information about 'Rural and urban settlements' (Learner's Book page 87) and discuss the questions in the Activity on the same page. Ask for volunteers from groups to report back on the Activity so that the class can discuss the questions on Learner's Book page 87. Write the word 'urbanisation' on the board and ask learners what it means. Write the definition on the board and then ask learners to work on their own to read the information on Learner's Book pages 88-89, and to do the Activity on Learner's Book page 89. If there is time, read the Bright Idea! case study to learners. It is about a school that nearly 'pays' for itself: it receives little government or community money, and is teaching valuable skills and knowledge that will contribute to the rural community where it is located in South America. Ask learners questions related to the reading: for example, could this approach work at their school (why or why not), and why is it useful to have knowledge and skills to grow plants? BRIGHT IDEA! Case study: A rural school that earns its own income The San Francisco Agricultural School in Paraguay (South America) is a high school that covers over 50 % of school costs by money earned from its own enterprise activities. It has 120 students aged between 16 and 18, who live on campus and do a three year course for a high school diploma in agriculture. The school was started in 2002 and is now nearly self-sufficient, which it means it can nearly support itself without other funding, which is its aim. The school follows a permaculture approach in its activities, including organic farming. Permaculture means 'permanent agriculture' - it is a particular approach to designing and growing plants (and animals) in a sustainable way that cares for the earth and for people, while still producing needed results. The goal of the San Francisco Agricultural School is to ensure that students learn the basics of agriculture and livestock management, including knowing about diseases and pests, equipment, administration and basic finances. In addition to these skills, students should also acquire values and principles such as responsibility and honesty, to care about nature and their culture. The school's enterprises earn money and are a place for the students to learn and practise both technical and entrepreneurial skills. A good example of this is the school's fresh vegetable business: Students do organic farming in the fields, develop their agriculture skills, and reinforce the theory they learn in the classroom. Then each week students take their harvest to the local market for sale. Dealing with customers, making sales, and marketing helps students to develop business skills. Students are involved in all aspects of the business, including keeping records of inputs and yields. The Head of Agricultural Production (an agronomist and teacher) is the person finally responsible for leading the enterprise. (An agronomist is someone who studies soil management and crop production.)!57 UNIT 2 MODULE 4Here are the main features of the school: Strong and entrepreneurial leadership; Good administration and good financial management; Detailed record keeping (from which good management decisions can be made); Passion, innovation and experimentation; and Permaculture farming - the school integrates this design approach into its learning and farming tasks to teach students about sustainable living.

If they do, you can supply them with this alternative text in the box, so that they can complete the graph for 1995 and 2020: In 1995, the urban population was 55 % of the total population of South Africa. By 2020, the urban population was 67 % of the total population. That means that, by 2020, two-thirds of South Africans lived in to wns and cities. 2. In 1995 the distribution in population between urban and rural areas was closer to being even, with only 14 % higher urban settlement than rural settlement. I n 2010 there is 50 % more urban settlement than rural settlement - only a quarter of our total population lives in rural areas. This rapid growth in urban areas has put a lot of strain on our resources, services and infrastructure - on sanitation, electricity, housing, healthcare, transport systems and education.

If there is time, introduce and talk about the problem of cholera in some densely populated places in the world - usually where there are poor conditions (e.g. no access to sanitation services; low levels of education about health and life skills). - Cholera is an acute diarrhoeal disease. It affects both children and adults and can kill within hours. - There are an estimated 3-5 million cholera cases and 100 000- 120 000 deaths due to cholera every year . 61 UNIT 3 MODULE 4- Yet cholera is an easily treatable disease - up to 80 % of people can be treated successfully through oral rehydration salts (a mix of salt, sugar and clean water). - It is also easy for people to protect themselves from cholera if they know the r elevant information and education. See the text in Bright Idea! for information, and photocopiable resources for learners in the Extra resources section. BRIGHT IDEA! Populations at risk What is cholera? Cholera is an infection caused by the bacterium Vibrio cholerae. People become infected by: drinking water or eating food that is infected with the bacteria; and poor sanitation and personal and domestic hygiene practices. Symptoms include sudden diarrhoea with profuse, watery stools, vomiting, suppression of urine, rapid severe dehydration, fall of blood pressure, cramps in legs and abdomen, subnormal temperature, and complete collapse. Death may occur within 24 hours unless quick medical treatment is given to the patient. Why is cholera a global problem? Cholera remains a global threat to public health and a key indicator of lack of social development. Recently, the re-emergence of cholera has been noted in parallel with the ever-increasing size of vulnerable populations living in unsanitary conditions. The number of cholera cases reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) continues to rise. From 2004 to 2008, cases increased by 24 % compared with the period from 2000 to 2004. For 2008 alone, a total of 190 130 cases were reported from 56 countries, including 5 143 deaths. In Africa in 2010 there were 115 106 reported c ases, and 3 397 deaths. Man y cases are not reported due to limitations in monitoring systems and fear of trade and travel sanctions. The true burden of the disease is estimated to be 3-5 million cases and 100 000-120 000 deaths annually. Cholera epidemics Cholera occurs in epidemic form when there is rapid urbanisation without adequate sanitation and access to clean drinking water. For this reason, the focus of epidemics has shifted to developing countries over the last century. Other risk factors include poor hygiene, overcrowded living conditions and a lack of safe food preparation and handling. Unstable political and environmental conditions such as wars, famines and floods that lead to displaced populations and the breakdown of infrastructure are very important risk factors for cholera. Cholera prevention A dequate water supply and sanitation are basic requirements for life. People living in high-risk areas can protect themselves by following a few simple rules of good hygiene and safe food preparation. The safe disposal of human excreta is of the utmost importance in the control of infectious and other communicable disease. The water supply system is one of the factors affecting the health and social organisation of the community.

As well as the improvement of water supplies, people must be advised through health education of the sources of their disease problems and how to avoid them. Primary health care education is a vital component in the prevention of cholera. Access to clean water Access to clean water and improved sanitation facilities is a fundamental human right. Yet, in many developed and developing countries, water quality shows continued deterioration and in many cases water sources are depleted. These effects are a function of increasing population pressure, agricultural misuse and the inability to keep pace with the increasing demands on the resource. A better understanding of the socio-economic, environmental and public health consequences of water supply and sanitation related diseases may help the public and policy makers understand the value of microbiologically safe water as well as improved sanitation facilities. In developing countries where resources may be inadequate, particularly in rural communities, basic hygiene education and sanitation programmes can be used to improve human health. The need for safe drinking water as w ell as adequate sanitation binds all of humanity into a single, global community.

Background Information From 900 ACE on, societies in the interior of southern Africa increasingly became part of a much wider world through trade, commerce and cultural exchange. This module focuses on Mapungubwe, its internal structure and its trade within Africa and across the Indian Ocean. Mapungubwe was a complex society of much larger political scale than had been seen before in southern Africa. There were changes in political power, leadership and authority and in organising, managing and maintaining that political power. It is important to understand Mapungubwe in its historical context. This module therefore starts with a brief overview of settlements in the Limpopo Valley before Mapungubwe, and concludes with a brief overview of Great Zimbabwe, which succeeded Mapungubwe as the centre of southern African trade. Further context is provided in the final unit, which looks at the travels of Marco Polo, as an example of a European explorer in Asia at the time when Mapungubwe was at the height of its power. Contextualising Mapungubwe provides a useful comparison of societies across some parts of the world in the same time period, and the opportunity to expand ideas about change and technological, social and political innovation. 69 UNIT 1 MODULE 5Unit 11Unit Southern African kingdoms long ago Learner's Book pages 98-99 1 hour Curriculum content and concepts Southern African societies between 900 ACE and 1300 ACE Change and continuity in the organisation of these societies Economic developments in these societies Teaching notes You will need: map of southern Africa Start this Module with the Activity in 'What do you know already?' on page 97 of the Learner's Book. Give the groups a few minutes to talk about the concept of 'kingdom' and take feedback. Remind learners that in Grade 5 they learned about how people in southern Africa lived during the Later Stone Age. Ask learners to remind you how the San lived together - how their society was organised. Tell them that this year they will 'fast-forward' through time and move further north to look at how people lived about 1 000 years ago, in the Limpopo Valley. Tell learners to look at the map on page 98 of their Learner's Books, and show them the Limpopo Valley on your map of Africa. Read through the text for Unit 1 with the learners. Make sure that they grasp the concept of a hierarchy - a form of organisation that is arranged in levels, from top to bottom, or high to low. People who are at the top of a hierarchy usually have more power or control than people who are lower down in the hierarchy. Ask learners to explain the word 'trade', or to look it up on page 179 if they don't know what it means. Talk briefly about what was traded and why, so that learners develop a picture of all the activities of people at this time (i.e. where does ivory come from? And gold? What did people do with the ivory and the gold?) Ask learners how people became powerful (they owned more land and cattle, therefore could trade more and own more) to ensure that they grasp the connection between wealth and power. Make sure too that they understand why it was important for the chief or king to control economic activities - point out that it is economic activities, the work that people do, that create wealth and therefore power. You might like to ask learners how this hierarchical organisation of society compares with how San society was organised (the San were far less hierarchical, and all things were meant to be shared equally among the group). Let learners work in pairs to do the Activity on page 99. They should write the answers individually in their notebooks. Take brief feedback to go over the answers.70 UNIT 1 MODULE 5Answers to activity Pair Learner's Book page 99 1. a) They owned a lot of land and cattle, therefore they could trade with other people. b) They controlled all the economic activities, like farming, mining and trading, and they collected taxes fr om the people they had power over. 2. a) (False): People had no say over who became chief. b) ( T rue): The chief divided up the land for people to farm. c) (T rue): People paid taxes to the chief or king. d) (False): People had no say over who their chief or king was, and no control over any economic activities.BRIGHT IDEA! Some interesting points about kingdoms in the world today Monarchies, in which the head of state is usually a king or a queen (the monarch), were the most common form of social organisation right into the 19th century. Usually, but not always, monarchs are succeeded by the eldest son (or sometimes daughter). Most countries have abolished their monarchies, but some still exist. Nowadays, most monarchies are constitutional monarchies, i.e. the monarch plays a ceremonial role, but has no direct political power. These countries are therefore fully democratic. The United Kingdom is the most obvious example of a constitutional democracy, but there are several others on the European continent (e.g. Denmark, the Netherlands, Spain and Belgium), in East Asia (e.g. Thailand and Japan), on our own continent (Lesotho and Morocco) and Jordan in the Middle East. However, some absolute monarchies still exist - the Vatican is an absolute monarchy, as are Eswatini and Saudi Arabia, among other countries. Source: Wikipedia 2011! Informal assessment Pair Activity page 99: Have learners made the connection between wealth and power? Can they extract relevant information from text to answer the questions? Do learners' answers show that they can distinguish the features of a monarchy from those of a democracy? Remedial and extension activities Remedial learners: Ask learners to write five sentences to describe what life was like in a kingdom about 1 000 years ago. Extension learners: Let learners imagine that they are a very powerful chief in the Limpopo Valley. They are very old, and know that soon their son will take over power. They want to make sure that their son is a successful and good ruler, so they write down five important things or 'rules' for a good chief to always remember.71 UNIT 2 MODULE 5Unit 12Unit Settlements in the Limpopo Valley Learner's Book pages 100-101 1 hour Curriculum content and concepts Changes in settlements and the formation of African kingdoms The effects of increasing contact with the wider world The Schroda settlement The K2 settlement Teaching notes You will need: world map; dictionary; a collection of old/broken items if you choose to do the Bright Idea! Activity Tell learners that they are going to find out about the beginnings of bigger and more powerful settlements in the Limpopo Valley. Let them look at the map on page 100 in the Learner's Book, and find Schroda and K2. Ask learners if they can think of any reasons why people would choose that area in which to build their settlement (the river provides water and the land would be fertile). Let learners read the text on pages 100-101 quietly. Show the learners the Arabic, Swahili (East Africa), Indian and Indonesian areas on the world map, so that they grasp how far-ranging trade activity was at this time. Talk briefly about what archaeologists do (a learner can look up the word in a dictionary and read out the meaning to the class, if necessary) and the important role they play in finding out about our history. Read out key sentences of the text to explain and summarise the key content and concepts for this unit. Read the Activity on page 101 with the class. Help them to imagine what archaeologists working at the K2 midden would do, how carefully they would examine objects and most importantly, what questions they would ask about each. Then let learners work in pairs to discuss the answers. Each learner should copy and complete the table in their notebook. BRIGHT IDEA! Archaeologists of 2150 To help learners grasp how archaeologists work, you might like to bring to class a collection of any old items and broken pieces of items you can find - or you could ask learners to bring some to class (e.g. part of the insides of an old computer, a discarded cell phone, broken pottery, an old shoe, a broken toy, etc). Learners imagine that they are archaeologists in the year 2150, digging and investigating in the area where they now live. These are the artefacts (objects or things) they have dug up. The class could work in groups to examine the collection, and draw conclusions about what each item tells us about society early in the 21st century.!72 UNIT 2 MODULE 5Answers to activities Pair Learner's Book page 101 Note that the above is a sample answer. Learners may well come up with a number of other ideas, and may relate technology, or how advanced the methods were of making things, to jewellery and household artefacts rather than weapons. They could also include pieces of rock and other materials that would indicate what dwellings were made of. Decorations on artefacts might give clues about the society's religious beliefs, and so on. Note also that it is very important to allow different reasonable interpretations of the 'evidence' found in the K2 midden, since this demonstrates how we come to have differing versions of events in history.Item What it tells us about the inhabitants of K2 Bones of human beings; teeth; skulls What they looked like, e.g. how tall they were Pieces of jewellery they wore, like necklaces or bracelets and earrings made from gold, ivory, copper, beads, etc.The things they were made from show what natural resources they had and who they probably traded with. How they were made would show what kind of skills the K2 inhabitants had. Animal bones, skulls, teeth What they ate; the animals they farmed with; wild animals they had to protect themselves against; the animals they hunted Old pieces of weapons like spears or arrows What these were made of and the methods used would tell us about how advanced their technology was, e.g melting and beating things into shapes, decorations on them, etc. Pieces of pots and other things they used every dayThese would give us clues about their everyday lives, e.g. how they cooked and stored food. Informal assessment Pair Activity page 101: Can learners identify historical sources? Can they draw reasonable and logical conclusions from these sources? Additional resources For the Bright Idea! Activity: a collection of any old items, and broken pieces of items you can find - or you could ask learners to bring some to class (e.g. part of the insides of an old computer, a discarded cell phone, broken pottery, an old shoe, a broken toy, plastic bottles, cooldrink tins, polystyrene 'takeaway' cartons or cups, and so on) http://www.mapungubwepark.com/parks/mapungubwe/tourism/kings.php73 UNIT 2 MODULE 5Remedial and extension activities Remedial learners: Give learners a piece of paper that they can fold in half to create two columns, or let them draw a line down the middle of the page in their notebooks. In the right hand column, they list all the things the people of Schroda and K2 had to trade. In the left hand column, they list the things they 'bought' or 'imported'. Extension learners could investigate how people become archaeologists: what, where and for how long they study, and where they work when they are qualified. 74 UNIT 3 MODULE 5Unit 13Unit Mapungubwe Learner's Book pages 102-109 6 hours Curriculum content and concepts King and sacred leadership First stone-walled palace Significance of Mapungubwe Hill First town Distinct social classes Golden rhinoceroses and other golden objects (symbols of royal power and political leadership) T rade across Africa, across the Indian Ocean and beyond (globalisation) Goods traded People's journeys on foot: routes, dangers, finding the way Today: World Heritage Site and Order of Mapungubwe Teaching notes You will need: if you choose to do the Bright Idea! Activity, you will need photocopies of the 'Appeal to save Mapungubwe' (Extra resources) for each learner group. Start by finding out what learners already know about Mapungubwe - they may be familiar with the famous golden rhinoceros. If you have managed to collect brochures or pictures, show them to the class. Read the introductory paragraph on page 102 with the learners and read through the Activity with them. You may need to explain that 'venerated' means (to see something as sacred or special), and 'molten' means 'melted'. Give the learners a few minutes to do the Activity in groups, then briefly discuss the answers as a class. Read the text on pages 102-103 of the Learner's Book with the learners. Ask them to explain why the people saw the king's leadership as sacred, and make sure they understand the king's role as intermediary (messenger) between ordinary people and their god. Let learners examine the picture on page 103 and identify the palace. Let them look at the photograph on page 104 as well, to get a real sense of what the hill looks like in its surrounding landscape. Ask learners for their opinions about why the king built his palace at the top of the hill. Would this affect how the people regarded him? Talk about the stone walls of the palace for a few minutes - how would they have been built? What do they think the ordinary people thought about the king's palace? Ask learners to read the text on page 104 quietly to themselves. Let learners tell you the main points of each paragraph (limit this 75 UNIT 3 MODULE 5to two points for the first two paragraphs, and three for the final paragraph). Let learners work in groups to do the Activity on page 105. Move among them while they are busy and help or contribute as necessary - make sure they understand that if something is 'taboo', it means that it is forbidden, not allowed. Ask learners to write their answers to Question 1 in their notebooks (they could also do this for homework). Ask learners to remind you how society was organised and how wealth (trade goods) was distributed at the time of the Zhizo people in Schroda. How did this change in K2 society? (If learners can't remember, refer them to page 101 of the Learner's Book). Explain that leaders in Mapungubwe continued and expanded the K2 tradition, so that Mapungubwe became the first class-based society in South Africa. Briefly explain 'class-based' if learners are puzzled by this. Read the text on page 106 of the Learner's Book with learners (or ask a confident reader to read it to the class). Explain any words the learners find difficult. Ask learners to examine the diagram on page 106. See if they can draw parallels between how society was organised, and the physical arrangement of the town. Drawing on the text and the diagram, learners do Question 1 of the Activity on page 106 individually, in their notebooks. This is a very good opportunity to check the learners' progress, so circulate to assess their work informally, noting learners who need remedial work. Let learners discuss Question 2 in small groups. Again, circulate, and intervene gently where you find one or two learners dominating the discussion, and ask shyer or quieter learners questions to draw them into the discussion. Remind learners about the Heritage T rail they did in the last term of Grade 5, and ask them what they can remember about Mapungubwe. Let them discuss what they remember of the golden objects, then read the text on page 107 of the Learner's Book with the class. Tell learners to work in pairs to discuss their answers to the Activity on page 107. They should write their answers individually, in their notebooks. Remind the learners that they are historians, and historians often have different interpretations of the same thing, so the answers in their notebooks do not have to be exactly the same as their partner's answers. Tell learners to look at the map on page 108 of the Learner's Book. Let them work in pairs to find the trading centres and trace the trade routes. Have a class discussion about the trade routes, and talk about how the traders would have travelled, how long their journeys would have taken them, what they would have eaten, where they would have slept, and so on.76 UNIT 3 MODULE 5 Let the learner pairs read the text on page 108 quietly together, then discuss their answers to the Activity. They should write their answers individually, in their notebooks. Ask learners to tell you what they know about World Heritage Sites. Remind learners what we mean by 'heritage': things and places of value that we have from our past and that we want to look after so that we can pass them on to future generations. These can be of cultural value, like Mapungubwe and Robben Island, or of natural value, like the Cape Floral Region. Read the text on page 109 of the Learner's Book with the class. Let them do the Activity in groups. After a few minutes, tell the groups to join up with another group and share their ideas. Answers to activities Group, Learner's Book page 1021. There are no wrong or right answers to this question. The purpose of it is to get learners thinking about ho w we find out about the past and how much of it is about piecing together the evidence we can find. 2. Place of jackals - there were many jackals in the area, which would giv e you clues about vegetation and other wildlife in the area that jackals would eat; place of venerated stone - that it is a stony place and that there is something special or valuable to do with the stone; place of wisdom - that wise people lived there, or maybe that it was a religious place with the wise people being priests; place where molten rock flowed - a place where people melted substances like metals which they found in the rocks (such as gold or iron). Group, Learner's Book page 1051. Mapungubwe grew big because: it was a good place to keep cattle and grow crops, there was plenty of water and it was a healthy place to live and bring up your family; people from other countries travelled past and you could trade goods with them; there were wild animals to hunt for meat and skins, and for ivory which you could trade;BRIGHT IDEA! Make copies of the 'Appeal to save Mapungubwe' (Extra resources) for each learner group. Ask learner groups to read the appeal together, then ask a few leading questions to make sure they understand what the issue is. Let the groups brainstorm the possible consequences of mining in a valuable heritage area. They can make notes while they are doing this, but should write their letters individually (see below). Ask learners to write a letter to the authorities explaining why they object to the construction of the coal mine.!77 UNIT 3 MODULE 5 the mountain provided good protection from enemies - you could hide your army easily in the mountain; and there was also a strong leader who made sure the people lived together peacefully. Note that learners may come up with other very good reasons.2. a) The legends probably grew around the fact that the king and his family lived on top of the mountain and people believ ed that the king had great spiritual powers. They believed that the king made it rain, which was very important for the health of the people, their animals and their crops. They possibly also believed that the king had other powers, such as creating good or bad luck. The king would also have had powerful friends and powerful enemies; there may have been plots to murder the king or the queen, and so on. This is a sample answer; any answers learners can support to make them plausible, are acceptable. Individual and Group Learner's Book page 1061. (Individual) (1) The king and his family lived on the top of the mountain. The elite lived on the lower slopes of the mountain and other small hilltops. The commoners liv ed on the flat land around the bottom of the hill. (2) The king lived in a in a stone-walled palace and the elite lived in houses surrounded by stone enclosures. The commoners lived in clay huts. (3) The king and the elite were rich and ate better food than the commoners, who were poor. (4) Rich people were buried at the top of the mountain and the elite were buried in the hills and they probably had many funeral traditions. The commoners would have been buried on the flat land at the bottom of the mountain and the hills, and their funeral traditions would have been very simple. (Learners' answers should include any three of the above.) 2. (Group) There are no wr ong or right answers to this question. What is important is that learners can support their opinions with good reasons, and that they are willing to listen to, and allow the opinions of others. Pair Learner's Book page 1071. Any five of the following: gold bangles, gold beads, necklace of gold beads and cowrie shells, objects cover ed in gold foil, a golden bowl, a golden sceptre, a golden rhino. 2. The cowrie shells probably came from coastal countries to the east of the Limpopo Valley , e.g. Mozambique and Kenya. 3. They prove that people worked with gold in southern Africa a ver y long time ago, and that Mapungubwean society was divided into social classes including a class that was very wealthy. Pair Learner's Book page 1081. The rivers would have provided the travellers with much needed water . Perhaps it was also more likely to find other human 78 UNIT 3 MODULE 5settlements for trade, alongside rivers. The rivers may also have provided a sense of direction. 2. Persia, Egypt, India, Arabia, China 3. Exports: salt, cattle, animal skins, fish, bone, ivory, wood, shells, pottery , chert, ostrich eggshell beads, things made of iron, copper and gold. Imports: glass beads metals, jewellery, cloth. (Learners do not need to list all the exports - any five is sufficient.) Group Learner's Book page 1091. Mapungubwe Cultural Landscape was declared a W orld Heritage Site because it provides evidence about the biggest kingdom in southern Africa, and it also shows a lot about trade (who traded and what they traded) and provides evidence of how the trade routes of the time crossed continents. 2. Threats to World Heritage Sites would include theft, people picking flow ers or digging up plants where they are not allowed to do so, and natural disasters like fires, floods, or drought. Constant wind could cause erosion and the sun could fade things like drawings on rocks. Informal assessment Group Activity, page 102, number 2 and group Activity, page 105, number 1: Are learners able to draw convincing conclusions based on the 'evidence' given in the Learner's Book?

They have found five objects and have to write a report for the professor in charge of the project. In their report, they should list the five objects they have found, and write a sentence saying what they think each object tells us about society and life in Mapungubwe almost 1 000 years ago. Extension: Learners could role play interviews between an archaeologist in the 21st century and a group of people who lived in Mapungubwe in the 13th century. The archaeologist has found a number of items and would like more information about what they are, what they are used for, how they are made, and so on.80 UNIT 4 MODULE 5Unit 14Unit East coast trade Learner's Book pages 110-111 1 hour Curriculum content and concepts Change and continuity in east coast trade with settlements inland Great Zimbabwe Teaching notes You will need: map of southern Africa Find out what learners know about the Great Zimbabwe Ruins, and show them where they are on the map of southern Africa. Read and discuss the text and picture on page 110 with the learners. Ask them for their ideas about why Mapungubwe might have been abandoned and replaced with Great Zimbabwe. The population of Great Zimbabwe grew to 20 000: see if learners can remember how many people lived in Mapungubwe (see page 104). To give learners an idea of how big this is, compare it with the number of learners in your school - if there are 200 learners, then Great Zimbabwe was 100 times bigger than your school. Ask learners to tell you what was similar and what was different between Mapungubwe and Zimbabwe (for example, the elite of Great Zimbabwe, like the elite of Mapungubwe, lived in a special area away from the commoners and this area was also enclosed by stone walls, but whereas Mapungubwe flourished for about half a century, Great Zimbabwe flourished for much longer than that.) Ask learners to work individually to complete the Activity on page 111 in their notebooks. Walk among them to assess individual learners' progress and help where necessary. When they have finished let learners pair up, swap books and assess each other's work.81 UNIT 4 MODULE 5Resources Great extension activities Remedial learners: Ask learners to write a paragraph about the rise and fall of Great Zimbabwe. Extension learners: Let the learners work in Pairs or small groups to find out how gold was mined in Africa in the 1300s. They could work around the following questions: How was the gold bearing rock broken out from the rest of the rock? How was the gold itself extracted? How did they work with the metal to turn it into jewellery and other objects?Informal assessment Individual Activity, page 111: Can learners extract relevant information from the text?

Explain that they are now going to find out about what was happening elsewhere in the world, at the same time as Mapungubwe was a powerful and wealthy kingdom. Find out if anyone knows why Marco Polo is famous. Tell them to look at the map on page 112 in the Learner's Book, and talk about his travels. Ask learners to read out which countries he went through, and let them suggest some of the difficulties he might have encountered as he went through each country (apart from climate, illness, wild animals and hostile or criminal people he may have come across, communication and language would have been a hurdle to overcome). Ask learners to read the text quietly to themselves. Then discuss the text with them asking leading questions to ensure that they have grasped the main points. Let learners suggest what important things the world learned from Marco Polo's adventures at the time. Let learners work individually to complete the Activity on page 112. Before they start on number 3 of this Activity, read through it with them and explain words that give them difficulty. Point out that Polo describes the size in terms that people can understand - paces, a barrel, hands, loaves of bread. Hand out blank sheets of paper and make sure learners have access to coloured crayons or pencils. BRIGHT IDEA! Great wonders from the travels of Marco Polo You will need: you may like to bring to class pictures of South African wild creatures (lions, leopards, Cape cobra, elephant, buffalo, hippo, and so on) - available from old calendars, tourist brochures, travel magazines, etc. Ask the learners what they think the creature Marco Polo describes in the Activity on page 113 of the Learner's Book, really is. Remind them that they are studying events in the 13th/14th century, so we are long past the age of dinosaurs. Accept any plausible answers (perhaps a crocodile?).!83 UNIT 5 MODULE 5Answers to activity Individual Learner's Book page 113 1. a) Europe, Asia b) Indian Ocean 2. Marco Polo's book made people want to find out about countries far away and encouraged other people to start on journeys to explor e the Far East. 3. Learners' drawings should be faithful to the description: a long, fat snake like creature; two short legs ending in two small and one large claw , near the head; a very large head with huge eyes; an enormous mouth with very big teeth. Ask learners to work in small groups. If you have brought pictures of South African wildlife, distribute them among the groups. These will be reference materials for the Activity. Tell learners they are to imagine that they are the young Marco Polo of the 13th century, and this time he is travelling through Africa. He comes across many wild creatures he has never seen in his life before. In their groups, learners study the pictures and work out how Marco Polo would describe the creature they have chosen. Remind them that he would describe the creature in terms that his people at home in Italy in the 13th century would understand (so, for example, he wouldn't compare the height of a giraffe to a skyscraper, because there were no skyscrapers in the 13th century!).

Additional resources http://www.history-timelines.org.uk/people-timelines/17-marco-polo-timeline.htmhttp://www.middle-ages.org.uk/marco-polo.htm Remedial and extension activities Marco Polo would have kept detailed notes about his observations during his journeys. Both remedial and extension learners could write the entry for one day in his journal. Remedial learners should write about five sentences; extension learners may enjoy doing a little research on one of the countries Polo crossed, to write a longer entry.84 REVISION ACTIVITY MODULE 51. Evidence: Remains of pottery, wood, ivory, bone, ostrich eggshells, and the shells of snails and freshwater mussels indicate that many other materials were used and traded with groups as far away as East Africa Arabia, E gypt, India and China. Beliefs: They controlled trade routes along the Limpopo Valley to the coast of East Africa. They traded with Arabia, China and India. Evidence: Tools hav e been found that date back to 1 500 years ago. Beliefs: They made their own pottery and metal tools. Metalwor kers and potters made objects of clay, iron, copper and gold for practical and decorative purposes. They were skilled in working with gold. Evidence: The houses on the top of Mapungubw e Hill are larger and made of stone and clay. Beliefs: The society was divided into social classes of rich and poor. The rich and powerful lived at the top of Mapungub we Hill. Their followers stayed at the bottom of the hill and in the surrounding area. Evidence: A midden in the valley, wher e ordinary people lived, shows that rich and poor people ate very different foods. Beliefs: The society was divided into social classes of rich and poor. People got milk, meat and skins from their farm animals and they also hunted, snared and gathered other food. Evidence: Remains of bones of rhinoceros and iv ory were found. Beliefs: They hunted elephant and rhinoceros in the area. People got milk, meat and skins from their farm animals and they also hunted, snared and gathered other food. Evidence: Human remains and the r emains of storage huts indicate that the people farmed millet, sorghum and cotton. They also had domesticated cattle, sheep, goats and dogs. Belief: Large farming communities started to settle in the Limpopo Valley ar ea.

Marco Polo Answers should include the follo wing essential points, and any other three interesting points: He was an explorer. He travelled from Italy across Asia to China. He brought goods back to Europe with him, which helped to start trade between Europe and Asia. In your assessment of learners' answers, consider the follo wing: Is the content factually correct? Is all the information relevant to Marco Polo? Is it logically organised? Does the answer include an explanation of the impact or effects of Marco Polo's exploration (last bulleted point above)? Would the paragraph be interesting to a Grade 4 learner, i.e. does the answer reveal interest in, and enthusiasm for finding out about the past? 2. 86 Introduction Explorers from Europe find southern Africa Content and time The suggested teaching time for History is approximately 15 hours per 10-week term (that is, approximately 1\u00bd hours per week of contact time).

Background information The focus of this module is on changes in Europe that enabled Europeans to explore other parts of the world, and their early exploration of the southern African coast. It is important to note that the European Renaissance occurred at the same time as when the Kingdom of Great Zimbabwe was at the height of its powers. At this stage in European history, Europeans knew very little about Africa. They began to explore our continent only about 600 years ago. The impact that Europe had later on the continent of Africa will be studied in Grades 7, 8 and 9.UNIT 1 MODULE 688 Unit 11Unit The European Renaissance Learner's Book pages 118-119 2 hours Curriculum content and concepts A turning point in European history Began as a cultural movement in Italy Rejection of ideas and attitudes of the Middle Ages The Age of Humanity: the importance of science, learning, freedom and the rights of individuals Teaching notes You will need: photocopies of the peer assessment sheet (Extra resources); large sheets of paper, old magazines, glue, scissors, coloured crayons or pencils. Let learners work in groups to discuss the questions in 'What do you know already?' on page 117 in the Learner's Book. Use this discussion to talk about what learners will be finding out about in this module: travellers in the 15th century and the changes brought about by what they discovered, learned and brought back to Europe. You could briefly talk about each of the questions the learners have just been discussing, in relation to these 15th century travellers. 'Renaissance' is a French word meaning 'rebirth'. Ask learners if anyone can explain what 'renaissance' means. If nobody knows, ask a learner to read out the definition on page 118 in the Learner's Book (Flash Fact) and another learner to read out the explanation given on page 179 of the Learner's Book. If you combine the two definitions, you get a fairly good answer to the key question on page 118: What was the European Renaissance? Tell learners to read the text on page 118 quietly to themselves. Discuss the text with the class, making sure that they have grasped the main points. Let learners find Italy on the world map, as well as the other countries mentioned in the text. Make sure that learners can also show you on the map, roughly where the Roman Empire was. Ask learners if they can think of any reasons why the Middle Ages were also called the Dark Ages. Remind learners that historians look at available evidence from which they draw conclusions to develop stories or theories about what happened in the past. That is exactly what they will do now, in thinking about the questions in the Activity on page 118. Brainstorm ideas with the class, summarising them on the board or a flipchart. Read and discuss the text and the pictures on page 119 of the Learner's Book. Then ask learners to close their books and summarise for you the main changes that made the Renaissance 89 UNIT 1 MODULE 6possible (better education created a desire for new knowledge and ideas and a love of learning; new technologies made printing lots of copies of books possible, so more people were reading and learning; new technology made travelling bigger distances possible; as people travelled and brought new things home with them, a desire for those things was created and so trade between countries started; a desire to spread the Christian religion). Explain the Activity on page 119 in the Learner's Book to the class and let them choose a topic. Before they start, discuss how they will find the information they need, and hand out copies of the assessment sheet to each group so that they know what they are working towards. Tell learners to do the research and plan their posters for homework. Let learners create their posters and present them to the class. Using their copies of the peer assessment sheet (see Extra resources) learners can assess one another's posters. Answers to activities Class Learner's Book page 1181. You may need to give learners a few clues to start them off: look at where I taly is on the map of the world, for example to demonstrate that they have a lot of coastline and so would be a seafaring nation; they are close to the Middle East so travel between Europe and Asia would definitely involve passing through Italy, which would have led to sharing knowledge and ideas, the creation of trade and thus wealth. You could also point out that a large part of Italy's heritage is the Roman Empire, and people might have become more interested in their heritage and begun to study its history. 2. Answers should include some of the following, and learners may come up with other equally valid ideas: peaceful conditions, allowing people time to engage in more than simply survival activities; this in turn would allow for the growth of an economy; a stable and growing economy would mean that people would become wealthier and able to buy new products, so trade would flourish; as people become wealthier, they often have more leisure time and therefore the time to read and become educated, to create and enjoy art and music, and the time and money to travel; access to waterways and ports would be important for trade routes; a temperate climate would encourage travellers to visit, resulting in more sharing of knowledge, ideas and resources. Group Learner's Book page 1191. Let learners assess one another's work, using the assessment sheet (make copies of Extr a resources page). Do make sure that their work is factually accurate, and correct any inaccuracies.90 UNIT 1 MODULE 6Additional resources Peer assessment sheet (Extra resources) Remedial and extension activities Remedial learners: Learners can write a few sentences under the heading 'Did you know? Five interesting facts about the European Renaissance'. Extension learners could find out more about Johannes Gutenberg and the printing press. Alternatively, they could imagine that they are a member of a wealthy merchant class family living in Florence during the Renaissance period. They have just finished entertaining some very interesting travellers from the East, and are now going to write a letter to a friend or relative in France, telling them all about the visitors.Informal assessment Assess learners' participation in and contributions towards the Group Activity on page 119.91 UNIT 2 MODULE 6Curriculum content and concepts Leonardo da Vinci: artist, scientist, inventor Galileo Galilei: scientist and inventor of the telescope Galileo proves that the Earth and other planets revolve around the sun: the Copernican system Teaching notes You will need: dictionaries; a blank sheet of paper for each learner; coloured crayons or pencils; for the Activity on page 121: two balls of different mass for each learner group, e.g. a golf ball and a tennis ball, or a tennis ball and a cricket ball (you could ask learners who have balls like these to bring them to class); photocopies of Galileo's 'falling objects' experiment (Extra resources) for each learner Pair (not essential, you can use the board or a flipchart); for the second Activity on page 121: for each learner group (you could ask learners to bring most of these items to class) a piece of string at least 1 metre long; a piece of metal wire to bend into a hook; some nuts from a tool box - they must all be the same weight and must fit onto the hook; a large piece of cardboard to put behind the pendulum, or a large piece of paper that you can stick on the wall behind the pendulum; a pencil; some tape; a stopwatch; copies of Galileo's pendulum experiment (Extra resources page) for each learner Pair (or, see below, you need just one set of these requirements to demonstrate the experiment to the class) Find out what your learners already know about Leonardo da Vinci and Galileo Galilei and invite them to share what they know. Read and discuss the text and pictures about da Vinci on page 120 of the Learner's Book. If you have access to books with pictures of da Vinci's drawings and paintings, let learners examine and comment on them. Read through the first two questions of the Activity on page 120, and if you think most of the words in question 2 will be new to the learners, tell them to choose three words to look up (or assign words to learners yourself). Explain to the learners how they will work: start by drawing their flying machines, and while they are doing that, they can take turns to access the dictionaries to look up the words they don't know. Before they start, help them to think about their flying machine designs: what is the purpose of the flying machine: e.g. is it to transport people to other continents, to other planets, or perhaps they might want to design a car that turns into a flying machine when you want to get out of a traffic jam? Or perhaps it is a little flying machine that you can use to cross wide roads or rivers where there are no bridges? Unit 12UnitLeonardo da Vinci and Galileo Galilei Learner's Book pages 120-121 2 hours92 UNIT 2 MODULE 6Encourage learners to be inventive, pointing out that that was what made da Vinci such a great man. Thinking about a purpose for their machine will help them to decide how big it should be, what it should be made of, and so on. Let learners work individually on the first two questions of the Activity. They should write the meanings of the words in their notebooks, but you may like them to do their drawings on blank sheets of paper. Learners should discuss the third question of the Activity in their groups. A tip for the learners is to look up the defining things about the Renaissance on page 118 of their Learner's Books - this might help them frame their answer to the question. Ask learners to write their answers individually in their notebooks. Throughout the time they are busy with this Activity, circulate to assess informally and help as needed. Ask learners to read the text on page 121 of the Learner's Book quietly to themselves. Then work together with the class to find the key sentences or main points in the text. Let learners read the key sentences aloud. Make sure they understand what heresy means, and why Galileo was placed under house arrest for life. Explain to learners that during the Renaissance people returned to studying the works of the Ancient Greek and Roman scholars. Ask a learner to reread the first paragraph of the text on page 121 of the Learner's Book. Tell them that they are going to conduct Galileo's experiment which proved Aristotle's theory wrong. Point out that people had believed Aristotle's theory for over 2 000 years, and that nobody had ever tested the theory! Galileo's experiment therefore also proved that theories in physics must be tested to make sure that they are true and right. If you have made copies of the experiment worksheets, hand them out to each learner group and go through it with them making sure they understand what to do. If you don't have copies of the worksheets, write the table up on the board for the learners to copy into their notebooks. Use the worksheet to tell learners what to do. Make sure that learners choose sturdy chairs to stand on - you don't want anyone to fall! Ensure that they are all working with balls of differing mass. Give the learners a few minutes to repeat the experiment a few times, then let the groups share their findings with the class. You can organise number two of this Activity in two ways. - If you have managed to assemble the resources, or if learners hav e brought them to class, hand out the copies of Galileo's pendulum experiment worksheet to the class, and read through it with them. Once you are sure they understand what to do, let them follow the instructions to set up the experiment. Check that all groups are correctly set up then let them do the first experiment. Let the groups share what they discover, and then let them do the next experiment, share 93 UNIT 2 MODULE 6their findings and go on to the next experiment. Discuss the conclusions they reach as a class. - If your class is too big to do this, or you cannot assemble enough resources, use the wor ksheet to instruct one group of learners to set up the experiment, then let another group of learners conduct the first experiment. Let the class discuss the conclusions they come to, based on what they observe. Ask another group to conduct the next experiment and have a class discussion about the results. Do the same with the third experiment and then discuss the conclusions the class reaches, based on what they have observed. BRIGHT IDEA! Learners may enjoy role playing how they would market their flying machine inventions to the Board of Directors of a big company who are interested in manufacturing and selling their machines. (Or you could choose the three best inventions which the inventors would present to the class who are the Board of Directors.) Let them form small groups and decide who the inventor will be, and which invention from that group will be presented. The rest of the group are the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors would need to examine the invention and think of questions they want to ask before they invest a lot of money into making and selling the flying machine. The inventor would need to prepare very carefully who would buy the machine, why they would need or want it, how they would use it, and what makes it special and different to all other flying machines. If the Board of Directors likes the invention and decides to go ahead with it, they could 'strike a deal' with the inventor: will they pay the inventor for his idea, or will the inventor not be paid now, but be given a percentage of the profits from the sale of the machine?! Answers to activity Individual/Group Learner's Book page 120 1. No correct answers, but make sure that learners follo w instructions as given during the lesson, and that they have given their inventions appropriate labels. 2. Painter: an artist who makes pictures using paint; sculptor: a person who creates statues by car ving wood or cutting stone; architect: a person who designs buildings; musician: someone who performs or creates music; scientist: a person who studies the physical world; astronomer: a scientist who studies the stars; mathematician: someone who studies mathematics; engineer: someone who plans and constructs machines and builds things like bridges; inventor: someone who is the first person to think of or make something; anatomist: someone who studies the bodies of humans and animals; geologist: a person who studies what rocks and stones are made of; cartographer: a person who draws maps; botanist: someone who studies plants; zoologist; someone 94 UNIT 2 MODULE 6who studies animals; palaeontologist: someone who studies fossils; writer: a person who writes books. 3. Reasons for agreeing with the statement that da Vinci was a perfect example of a Renaissance man would include his scientific curiosity and desir e to know more about the physical world around him: although he painted religious scenes in his studies he was interested in the here and now rather than the hereafter and religion. As a good example of a Renaissance person, he dedicated his entire life to learning and knew a lot about all sorts of different subjects, such as astronomy, mathematics, engineering, geology, the structure of plants and human and animal bodies, and even fossils. He also made many important scientific discoveries. He was skilled at many different things: he drew maps, he sculpted, he was a musician, he designed buildings and other things like flying machines, and he was one of the greatest artists of the Renaissance. Informal assessment Individual/Group Activity, Learner's Book page 120: Can learners use a dictionary successfully? Could they define some of the words they looked up? Do their answers to question 3 show that they can select appropriate and relevant information from text? Group Activity, Learner's Book page 121: Did learners record their observations in the experiments accurately? Were they able to make logical connections between what they did and the results? Were they able to draw reasoned conclusions from their observations?

Learners should fill the gaps with the correct words without consulting their Learner's Books. They can check their own answers by looking at page 121 of the Learner's Book. Extension: Learners could work in Pairs to research Leonardo da Vinci in any of his roles - as a painter, an inventor, a scientist, and so on. Or they could find out more about Galileo's inventions.96 UNIT 3 MODULE 6Unit 13Unit New ideas and knowledge Learner's Book pages 122-123 1 hour Curriculum content and concepts New ideas during the Renaissance: secularism, humanism, individualism and scepticism The link between the European Renaissance and the golden age of Arab-Islamic science and culture Achievements of middle Eastern and Asian scholars Teaching notes Remind learners that the Renaissance came after a time often called the Dark Ages because there was so much war, poverty and sickness. The word 'renaissance' comes from a French word meaning to be 'reborn', which makes it a good word to describe what happened during the Renaissance period: it is as though humanity was 'reborn' into a time of peace and greater prosperity which made it possible for people to study more and have discussions and debates, enabling the birth of new ideas and knowledge. Read through the text on page 122 with the learners, stopping after each idea to ask questions and allow learners to ask questions until you are sure that they understand the concepts. Ask learners to do the Activity on page 123 in pairs. It is important that you circulate while they are busy. Listen to what they say, assess informally and correct or help where necessary. Read and discuss the first paragraph of text on page 123 of the Learner's Book, as well as the map. Ask learners for how many centuries the golden age of Arab science and culture lasted and compare this with how long the Renaissance lasted to demonstrate that the Arab golden age lasted for a very long time - clearly, they had many ideas and much knowledge to share with Europe! Ask learners to read the rest of the text quietly to themselves. Invite them to put up their hands and ask you the meaning of any words they find difficult. When they have finished reading, tell them to close their books and tell you what they remember. Help them if necessary, with leading questions such as: Who did the Middle Eastern scientists swap ideas with? How did mathematical works published in China centuries ago become a part of the European mathematical heritage? Who can give examples of some of the achievements of Middle Eastern and Asian scholars?97 UNIT 3 MODULE 6Answers to activity Pair Learner's Book page 123 2. Key characteristics of each idea: secularism: the increase of interest in matters to do with life here, now , in this world rather than (as in the Middle Ages) a concern with religion and faith in things that are not of this physical world; humanism: places human beings and what is best and good about human beings at the centre of the world, rather than God or any other supernatural being (therefore linked to secularism); individualism: allows each individual to believe in and develop what is special about them as an individual; scepticism: sceptics do not take things on faith; they ask questions. Informal assessment Pair Activity on page 123 in the Learner's Book: Have the learners grasped the key characteristics of each Renaissance idea?BRIGHT IDEA! You could extend the Pair Activity into a very simple class quiz. Ask learner pairs to write down the definitions of the Renaissance ideas they have discussed. Ask a pair to read out one of their definitions, and let the class guess which idea they have described. Ask another pair to do the same and continue until you are confident that learners have grasped the four ideas.! Remedial and extension activities Remedial learners can write definitions of each of the Renaissance ideas in their Learner's Books. Extension learners could write a paragraph explaining how Middle Eastern and Asian scholars have contributed to the knowledge we enjoy today.98 UNIT 4 MODULE 6Unit 14Unit Inventions Learner's Book pages 124- 125 2 hours Curriculum content and concepts Inventions during the Renaissance How these inventions changed the world Teaching notes You will need: dictionaries Ask learners to summarise what they have learned about the Renaissance so far (why it happened; two famous Renaissance men - da Vinci and Galileo; the new ideas that emerged in this time). Explain that the class will now turn their attention to Renaissance inventions which brought great changes to our world. Read through the Activity on page 124 with the learners, then let them form small groups to read through the text and discuss their answers to the questions. The Activity will probably work best if you make sure that the learners are in mixed ability groups. Tell them to elect one person in the group to use a dictionary to look up the meaning of any words they don't understand. Take feedback from the groups and discuss some of the ideas that emerge. Make sure that learners always support their opinions with convincing reasons. Read and explain the Activity on page 125. Tell learners to read through the text for this unit again, but this time individually and quietly, and then complete the Activity. If there is time, let individual learners pair up and share their answers with each other. Remember to walk around the class to do informal assessment. Take in the learners' notebooks to check and informally assess their work. BRIGHT IDEA! If you find that learners have differing views about any particular invention, you could turn that into a topic for class debate, e.g. 'The world would have been a better place if the match had never been invented'. Divide the class into 'for' and 'against' groups, let them prepare their arguments and then conduct the debate (guidance on how to conduct a class debate is given in the Grade 4 TG).! Answers to activities Group Learner's Book page 124 2. a) Yes. Possible reasons (accept all other logical reasons offer ed by the learners): When people fought with spears and swords, they needed to be close to each other; probably these weapons were quite heavy and it wasn't so easy to run fast carrying them. 99 UNIT 4 MODULE 6With guns you can shoot people from a distance away; they are light so you can move more quickly and easily, they are faster so you can shoot more people in less time. Gunpowder also made it possible to create bombs to blow up buildings, or kill more people with one explosion. All this would have changed how armies planned their attacks on the enemy and defences against the enemy. b) Yes. Possible reasons (accept all other logical reasons offer ed by the learners): The caravels were fast and could sail into the wind because they had tall masts and big square sails. This made it possible to travel further and for a longer time across the sea, to countries very far away. The magnetic compass made it possible to navigate (find your way) accurately, again making it easier and less dangerous to travel far distances over the ocean. c) Sample answers (accept all other plausible ideas that learners come up with): without gunpo wder, we would still have wars, but our methods of fighting them would be very different; since gunpowder makes blasting (blowing things up) possible, our mining methods and engineering methods would never have advanced - we'd still be chopping out rock; if people hadn't developed ships and instruments enabling sea travel over long distances, perhaps it might have taken much longer for Europeans to discover South Africa (or southern Africa); without the printing press we'd still be writing books by hand, there would be far fewer books and therefore very few people would be able to read; if we still used sundials to tell the time, we wouldn't know the time on days when the sun doesn't shine; without the flush toilet, we would have to find other ways of getting rid of our waste, and that often creates more disease; without the telescope we would never have advanced our knowledge of the stars, without the submarine, we would not be able to travel beneath the sea; without the match we would still need to use sticks and stones and the sun to create fire. Individual Learner's Book page 125See the assessment guidelines under the heading 'Informal assessment'. Informal assessment Group Activity, page 124: Are learners able to extract relevant information from the text and illustrations to give reasoned answers to the questions? Are they able to talk about the changes effected by the Renaissance inventions? Are they able to draw conclusions about what has remained the same, and what has changed, since then? (e.g. we still fight wars, but how we do so has changed significantly; we still travel all over the world, but how we do so has changed).100 UNIT 4 MODULE 6Individual Activity, page 125: Did the learner interpret the question correctly (two inventions dealt with in the unit; biggest impact on the world)? Has the learner given convincing reasons for the choices made? Does the learner's answer show insight into the effects of events and actions? Is all the information in the essay relevant to the question? Has the learner presented the information in an organised and logical way? Remedial and extension activities You could Pair remedial learners with extension learners and ask them to work together to research any one of the inventions on page 125, and make notes on the effects the invention had on society and people's lives at the time. They could then work together to create a poster for display in the classroom. The intention is for learners to enjoy working co-operatively, with remedial learners feeling supported by extension learners, who feel happy to be able to guide and help.101 UNIT 5 MODULE 6Curriculum content and concepts Reasons for European exploration The spread of the Christian religion The development of the spice trade Teaching notes You will need: World map Read and discuss the text at the top of page 126 in the Learner's Book. Ask learners to suggest why the Age of Exploration is also known as the Age of Discovery. Let learners identify the major countries travelled to on the world map in the classroom (Africa, Middle East, Asia, India, China). Read through the Group Activity on page 126, and point out that explorers would need to have strong reasons for going on their journeys: the journeys were long, dangerous and often not very comfortable (you might want to spend a few minutes discussing what some of the dangers and discomforts would have been). Let learners work in groups to discuss the question. Take feedback to have a brief class discussion. Discuss the reasons for their opinions - e.g. if they think a desire for spices was a major reason that motivated explorers to go on long and dangerous journeys, then why would they want those spices? It is important for learners to understand that the increase in trade during this time also meant an increase in the number of ordinary people who grew wealthy. Let learners read through the rest of the text on pages 126-127 quietly, and to study the map on page 127. Discuss the text with the class, asking leading questions to ensure they understand the main points (e.g. What were the Europeans especially interested in? Why? Where did spices come from? When did the Europeans start looking for a new sea route to the East? Why?) Ask learners to work in pairs to complete the Activity on page 127. They should write their answers in their notebooks. Learner pairs can join another pair and they can share and compare answers. Circulate while learners are busy, to assess informally and help as needed.Unit 15UnitThe Age of Exploration: Religion and trade Learner's Book pages 126- 127 1 hour102 UNIT 5 MODULE 6Answers to activities Group Learner's Book page 126 There are no right or wrong answers, as long as learners can give convincing reasons for their opinions.

Extension learners: You are the owner of a caravel. You have decided where you want to go, and why. Now write your 'To do' list of all the preparations you need to make before embarking on your voyage (e.g. how many ships do you need? How many crew? What provisions, and how much, and so on).Informal assessment Pair Activity, page 127: Do learners' answers show that they can retrieve relevant information from text and maps? Do their answers to the second question reveal insight into the resources available to sailors in the 15th century? Do their answers show that they considered the consequences of their decisions? 103 UNIT 6 MODULE 6Unit 16Unit The journeys of Dias and da Gama Learner's Book pages 128- 131 2 hours Curriculum content and concepts Dias sails around the tip of southern Africa Da Gama finds a sea route from Europe to India via the Cape of Good Hope The development of the spice trade The explorer as hero Teaching notes You will need: world map Read and discuss the introductory text on page 128 in the Learner's Book. Ask the learners if they can remember which was the most powerful kingdom in southern Africa at the time that Dias set out on his journey. T ry to get the learners to imagine what a very big adventure Dias set out on. For example, how would learners feel if they were dropped off in the veld on the outskirts of the city/town/village where they live, and were to set out on foot, to find the next town? How would they ensure that they didn't become completely lost? What preparations would they need to make? Let learners work in pairs to do the Activity on page 128. They should read all the text first and then start working out the correct order. They should draw the timeline in their notebooks and fill in the events in the right places. Go around the class to assess informally and help where needed. Ask learners to close their notebooks and Learner's Books, and tell you the story of Bartolomeu Dias and his voyage around the tip of Africa. How much can they remember? Let a few learners who are good readers read the text on pages 129 to 130 to the class. As they read through da Gama's voyage, stop to show learners the progress of his journey on the world map (you could ask a learner to do this). Make sure that learners understand what caused scurvy, one of the most common causes of death on these early voyages. Ask learners to work in pairs to do the first two questions of the Activity on page 130. Take feedback in a brief class discussion. Learners should do Question 3 of the Activity individually, in their notebooks. Ask the class to look at the two maps at the bottom of page 130, and tell you which map shows whose route. Learners should then work in pairs to do Question 1 of the Activity on page 131. Take brief feedback on this question. Brainstorm a few ideas about the second question with the class as a whole, then let learners work individually to complete the 104 UNIT 6 MODULE 6Activity. Take feedback in the form of a brief class discussion about what it would have been like to be a sailor in the 15th century. Let a good reader read the boxed text about da Gama on page 131 in the Learner's Book. When you are sure that everyone has understood the text, let learners work in pairs to discuss the questions in the Activity at the bottom of the page. Learner pairs could join up with another pair to share their ideas and opinions, or you might like to organise a class debate around the question: Was Vasco da Gama a hero who deserved the fame and wealth he got? BRIGHT IDEA! Explorers Quiz: How much do you remember? Explain to learners that they are going to do a revision quiz. Ask them to work in pairs, and explain how it will work. You will read out a question, followed by four possible answers. The questions are numbered 1 to 10, and the answers to each question are indicated with letters: a, or b, or c, or d. They are to listen very carefully, then write down the question number and the letter of what they think is the correct answer. Read each question and the answers twice, if necessary, but no more. When you have finished, read out the correct answers (in bold below) and let learners mark their own work. You might want to award small prizes to the learner pair with the most correct answers. 1.

Vasco da Gama, by figh ting the Khoikhoi Answers to activities Pair Learner's Book page 128 1. 1450 Around 1450 Bartolomeu Dias is born. 1481 Dias commands one of the ships sent by King John II of Portugal to explor e the Gold Coast of West Africa. 1486 10 October 1486 King John asks Dias to lead and expedition to sail around the southernmost point of Africa. 1487 August 1487 Dias leaves Portugal with two armed carav els and one supply ship. Sept-Nov 1487 Dias stops at Sao J orge de Mina, the Portuguese fortress on the Gold Coast, to stock up with extra supplies. 106 UNIT 6 MODULE 6 Sept-Nov 1487 Dias sails past the coast of Angola. Dec Dias reaches Walvis B ay. 1488 January 1488 Dias unknowingly sails through a storm ar ound the Cape of Good Hope, which he calls the Cape of Storms. February 1488 Dias lands at Mossel B ay, and then at Algoa Bay. 12 March 1488 Dias drops anchor at Kwaaihoek and decides to r eturn home. December 1488 Dias returns to Portugal after a v oyage of about 16 months. 1500 Dias sails with Captain Pedro Cabral on the voyage that r esulted in the discovery of Brazil. When they reach the Cape of Good Hope, they are hit by a storm. Dias dies at sea. Pair/Individual Learner's Book page 1301. (Pair) a) Da G ama's return trip took over 2 years. b) Da Gama took almost a year longer than Dias. (Learners can work it out exactly: D ias took 16 months; da Gama took 26 months, so his trip actually took 10 months longer.) 2. (Pair) a) A ccept all plausible and relevant answers from learners. They should think of some of the following: brave, adventurous, curious, intelligent, ambitious, determined, persev ering (the sort of person who does not give up easily), physical health and strength would also be important. b) Again, accept all plausible and relevant answers from lear ners. Some ideas would be: strong leadership skills; quick thinking skills; decision-making skills; problem-solving skills; as well as skills related to seafaring: excellent sailing skills; excellent navigational skills (read maps and instruments such as the compass; they would also need to be able to 'read' the stars); they would have to be able to repair sails, so sewing skills and woodworking skills; climbing skills (they had to climb the masts); they had to be able to tie excellent knots in ropes; fighting skills; and so on. 3. (Individual) S ee Informal assessment for guidelines to this answer. Pair/Individual Learner's Book page 1311. (Pair) a) Pr obably to help navigate and ensure that the ships did not simply get lost at sea, he would have kept the coastline of Africa within sight. Possibly also so that they could sail to shore and relative safety if they could see bad storms ahead. A ccept any other plausible reasons the learners may think of. b) Da Gama sailed ten years after Dias had set out, so he knew what r oute to take; he would have learned from Dias. Accept other plausible ideas from learners. 2. (Individual) S ee Informal assessment for guidelines to this answer.107 UNIT 6 MODULE 6Pair Learner's Book page 131 1. There are definitely no right or wrong answers to this question! What is important in the lear ners' answers is that they must be able to back up their ideas and opinions with convincing reasons. It is also important that they allow, or 'tolerate' the opinions of others - no shouting matches are allowed! Informal assessment Pair and Individual Activity, page 130: Can learners draw conclusions, based on the information provided in the text (Question 3)? Based on the information gleaned in this unit, have learners given a convincing, reasoned argument as to why they would, or why they would not, like to be an explorer? Have they organised their argument logically? Is all the information they provide relevant to the question? Individual Activity, page 131: Have learners given their diary entry a plausible date? To what extent do their answers reveal an understanding of the context in which the voyages of exploration were made - the conditions in which the sailors worked?

Extension learners could work in Pairs to research seafaring conditions in the 15th century, e.g. find out about navigational tools used by sailors at that time; find out about famous (or infamous) pirates; find out about the clothing the seafarers wore; find out about the food they took with them, how and where it was stored and cooked (they could choose, according to their interests).108 UNIT 7 MODULE 6Unit 17Unit Dias meets the Khoikhoi Learner's Book pages 132 -133 1 hour Curriculum content and concepts First meeting between Europeans and South Africans Meeting of different cultures and misunderstandings Teaching notes You will need: map of South Africa; dictionaries The class learned about the Khoikhoi herder society and their way of life in Grade 5. Ask volunteers to tell you what they remember. Read and discuss the introductory paragraph and the pictures on pages 132 and 133 of the Learner's Book. Ask a learner to point to Mossel Bay on a map of South Africa. Let the learners get into groups and read through the Activity on pages 132-133. Discuss the Activity briefly, to make sure that everyone understands what they are to do. Tell half the groups that they are the Khoi herders, while the other half are Dias and his sailors. Give the learners time to prepare, then let them role play the meeting. Manage this according to the time and space you have available. You could allow the groups to 'rehearse' their role play, all groups at the same time. This is probably best done outside as it may become rather noisy. Then let a few groups perform their role play to the class. Or you could watch all the groups' role play, one by one (which will be quieter). After each role play, let the groups talk about why they chose to end their 'meeting' in the manner they did. Where they chose to end in conflict, ask learners from each group to give their version of the story (i.e. the Khoi perspective, and the perspective of Dias's men). Briefly discuss with the class how the same event can be told in very different ways, without either way necessarily being completely wrong or completely right. Ask learners to work in pairs to read the text on page 133 in the Learner's Book quietly. Encourage them to use a dictionary to look up words they are not sure of. Ask a few leading questions to make sure learners understand the text, then let them discuss the questions in the Activity on page 133 in pairs. Broaden this into a class discussion when the learners are ready.109 UNIT 7 MODULE 6Answers to activities Group Learner's Book page 132 1. Learners' answers should be something along these lines, but they will have their o wn ideas. We saw strange ships and then saw men stopping the ships and climbing into small boats and coming towards the beach. They looked different because they had long hair, pale skins and wore strange clothes covering their bodies. They carried strange objects that we have never seen before. We felt curious about these strange people, and had lots of questions about them - where did they come from? Why did they come here? What did they want? We were also afraid: were they friendly, or not? And what were those strange things they carried - were they weapons? We thought we should go and greet them if they came back the next day, to find out more about them. But we also thought it would be wise to go in a big group, with our weapons in case these people turned out to be unfriendly. 2. See guidelines for Informal assessment, if you would like to assess the role plays. P air Learner's Book page 133 1. If the sailors had 'asked' the Khoi before helping themselves to the water, the conflict may have been avoided. If they had spoken the same language, or spoke each other's language, they would not have misunderstood each other. Perhaps if Dias's men had not shouted, but offered something concrete to the Khoi leader, conflict would not have happened. Accept other plausible answers from learners. 2. They wanted fresh milk and meat. BRIGHT IDEA! In preparation for and to enhance their experience of the role play, you might like to get learners to practise miming. They could mime, for example, being frightened, being hesitant or unsure, being brave, being puzzled, suddenly understanding something (the moment of 'Aha! Now I understand'). They could also mime becoming friends, as well as threatening actions, becoming angry and then even angrier, being amused or curious about something, wanting something, not hearing something or not understanding something, and so on. The point of the Activity is enjoyment and to overcome any shyness, so let learners do this together at the same time.! Informal assessment Group Activity, page 132: In the role play activity, consider whether learners' behaviour, stance and mimings show insight into the dynamics between the two groups: the tensions and the progression from that tension to either friendliness or conflict. In the discussion after the role plays, it is important that learners can see that the story of this meeting can be told in different ways from different points of view.110 UNIT 7 MODULE 6Remedial and extension activities Remedial learners: Imagine that you are one of the crew on Dias's ship. Write a letter to your people at home, describing the events of the day when you went ashore at Mossel Bay and met the Khoi people. Extension learners: Research all the different jobs people did on the ships during the voyages of discovery.Pair Activity, page 133: 1. Can learners provide good r easons for their ideas? 2. Can learners extract r elevant information from text? 111 UNIT 8 MODULE 6Unit 18Unit VOC journeys Learner's Book pages 134 -135 1 hour Curriculum content and concepts The Dutch East India Company as the most successful sea trading company in the 17th and 18th centuries Dangers and difficulties of long sea journeys in the 17th and 18th centuries Teaching notes You will need: a large sheet of paper or card for each learner group; rulers, pencils and (optional) coloured crayons or pencils Ask learners to tell you in which century Bartolomeu Dias and Vasco da Gama were exploring and going on their adventurous journeys. Explain that now they are moving forward into the next two centuries, the 17 th and 18th, when the Dutch East India Company was very busy and becoming very wealthy. Read the introductory text on page 134 of the Learner's Book with the learners, then ask them to read the text in the box ('Life on board') on pages 134 and 135 quietly to themselves. Briefly discuss the text to make sure that learners have understood what they read. The names of the diseases are not important, what is important is that they were highly infectious (communicable) and therefore difficult to control once one person had become ill. (Scurvy was caused by lack of fresh fruit and vegetables in the diet; sailors' gums swelled up and they often lost teeth. Typhus affected the digestive system or stomach, and dysentery and bubonic plague caused internal bleeding and swollen bumps on the body.) Let learners work in groups to write their lists of good and bad things that might happen to sailors, then read through the rest of the Activity and make sure that they understand what to do: measure and draw a square. The measurement should be divisible by 8, because there are 8 squares across, and 8 squares down. So depending on the size of their paper, their square can be 16 cm across and 16 cm down, or 24 cm across and 24 cm down. If their square is 16 cm \u00d7 16 cm, then they need to mark off where to rule the lines across and down, every 2 cm. If their square is 24 cm \u00d7 24 cm, they will mark off where to draw the lines at 3 cm intervals. Then they can number their squares according to the picture on page 135, draw their snakes and ladders and write in all the good and bad things. Give each group a large sheet of paper or card, and make sure everyone has access to pencils, coloured crayons or pencils and rulers. Circulate while learners are working to help and assess informally.112 UNIT 8 MODULE 6 Let learner groups share and comment on one another's snakes and ladders boards. If there is time, and if you have dice and counters (or see Bright Idea!) learners can play a game or two. BRIGHT IDEA! Learners can make their own counters and dice quite easily. You will need: scissors, glue or sticky tape, two 50 cent coins per group and different colour cardboard to make the counters (or plain card and coloured crayons); photocopies of the die template for each group (see Extra resources); stiff (not thick) card for each group.This is what you do: To make the counters, give each group a different colour card and two 50 cent coins (you can also use any other similar sized object). They should trace the shape and cut it out. You will need as many counters as there are players for the game in your class. Distribute the counters so that each player in a group has a different colour. If you run out of colours, learners can customise their counter by drawing a picture on it. To make the dice, give each group a die template and a piece of stiff card. Learners should stick the template onto the card and then cut it out. They should fold the die along the foldlines, put a little glue on the flaps and glue the die together. ! Answers to activities Group Learner's Book page 135 Good things: Winds blowing in the right direction; temperate weather; calm seas; good sleep; avoiding a pirate attack; recovering from illness; had fresh fish for dinner; fixed leak successfully; captain praised my work; and so on. Accept all plausible ideas from learners.Bad things: No wind; fierce storm; best friend drowned; mutiny; no fresh food left; no fresh water left; fighting on board; pirate attack; half the crew sick; sails tore in a storm; and so on. Accept all plausible ideas from learners. Informal assessment Have the groups shown insight into the issues that are important during a life at sea in a boat powered by wind and sails? Is their snakes and ladders board clear and useable? Have they correctly placed good things at the bottom of ladders and bad things at the top of snakes? Did all the members of the group contribute?

Write a diary entry describing the events of your day. Extension learners: You are Jan von Drak on your third trip to the East. Your younger brother wants to join you on the next voyage. Write him a letter, either encouraging him to do so, or discouraging him. Give him convincing reasons for your advice.114 REVISION ACTIVITY MODULE 61. a) Problems might include: no gravity; suitable food to take that won't take up too much space and that will still be healthy; how to store fr esh water for drinking; how to stay healthy; how to keep yourself and clothing clean; what sort of clothes you need; how to make sure there is fresh air in the space ship; and so on. Accept all plausible answers from learners. b) Gravity: special clothing to keep you weighted, ropes securing you and that y ou can use to pull yourself along; food: employ experts to help you/use freeze-dried food/by that time in the future we will have different, delicious, tablets for breakfast, lunch and dinner, giving us all the nutrition we need; fresh water: store in super light but super strong plastic containers; to stay healthy: by then we will have all the things we need to keep us healthy in our food tablets; space to do special exercises; we will have special clothing that massages our muscles to keep us fit; keeping clean: have portable showers and use recycled water for washing clothes; fresh air: install machines to recycle air; and so on. Accept all plausible answers, but not too many 'press a button and ...' solutions, as you want evidence of real thinking engagement with the problems! c) Assess all of these questions according to the following criteria: are learners ' answers relevant to the questions asked? Are learners able to predict problems according to historical context? Are they able to suggest solutions to problems according to historical context? Are they able to see the same travel problems from the point of view of a different time period? Is their drawing clear and clearly labelled? Is it clear to you how the machine or tool works, and how it helps solve the problem identified by the learner? 2. The Europeans wanted to find trade routes to places where they could get spices; they wished to spread the Christian r eligion; they wanted new knowledge; they wanted to find gold and silver; they wanted wealth, fame and power; they were curious; they wanted adventure. Any four of these reasons. 3. Middle Ages: time between 500 ACE and 1500 ACE when there was a lot of war , poverty and hunger/time between the fall of the Roman Empire and the beginning of the Renaissance when there was a lot of war, poverty and hunger (either of these answers); Module 6 Revision activity Learner's Book pages 136-137 3 hours115 REVISION ACTIVITY MODULE 6 Renaissance man: a person who was knowledgeable on many different topics, who was skilled in many different ways; who was curious about everything and questioned ev erything; Copernican system: Galileo's theory that the sun is at the centre of the universe/that the Earth and other planets revolve around the sun (either of these answers); Age of Exploration: the time between the mid-1500s and the 17th century when Europeans explored the world. 4. Middle Eastern and Asian scholars invented the decimal system; Arabic numerals; the theory of evolution; printing; they discov ered gravity; they discovered the relationship between weight, speed and distance; they measured the speed of light; they worked out the circumference of the Earth (any five). 5. Learners' answers should include at least five of the following points: People moved from an age of faith in God to an age of doubt and questioning. People became less interested in religion and more interested in trade, wealth and material things. Instead of God and life hereafter being the centre of attention, people made human beings and life on this Earth the centre of their attention and their studies. People returned to the study of the ancient Greek and Roman scholars and studied the Bible less. Instead of the community being most important, individual development became the focus of attention and education of the individual became important. Many new inventions changed people's lives forever (or learners may list individual inventions, but they should indicate how the invention changed people's lives). People became adventurous and travelled to distant countries bringing back new goods and new knowledge (or learners may list individual explorers and their achievements, but they should indicate what changes these made to people's lives in Europe). T rade expanded from Europe all the way to China and some people became very wealthy and powerful. Assess according to the following criteria: Have the learners understood the question? Are learners' answers factually correct? Have they provided at least four reasons why the Renaissance was a turning point? Are their answers logically organised? Is all the information given relevant to the question?116 REVISION ACTIVITY MODULE 66. Refer to the answers to the Activity on page 130 of the Learner's Book for qualities and skills required; and to the text on page 134 for possible dangers to be faced. The ship should be sailing from P ortugal to India, Asia and/or China, and according to where it is going should be anywhere between 12 and 26 months long. The purpose of the voyage may include to buy spices, silver, gold, precious stones, and to acquire new knowledge about sea routes. Assess according to the following criteria: Are the lear ners' answers historically correct (as per suggested answers above)? Are the learners' answers written from a perspective that emphasises the positive aspects of the sea voyage, i.e. have the learners managed to make the voyage sound exciting and attractive, in spite of the dangers? Are the advertisements logically organised? Is all the information presented relevant to the question? 7. Refer to the maps on page 130 of the Learner's Book for the correct r outes followed by each explorer. 8. Learners' answers should include the following points: Dias and his crew were badly in need of fresh meat and fresh water. The Khoikhoi and the Portuguese spoke different languages and could not understand each other. The Khoikhoi had never seen Europeans before and both parties were probably curious, but afraid and supicious. Dias's men helped themselves to water from the spring the Khoi people reserved for their animals. This made the Khoi people angry, since it was their custom to ask permission and offer gifts before using the water. The Portuguese tried to offer gifts but the Khoi people misinterpreted their gestures and they started fighting. Dias shot one of the herdsmen dead and the Khoikhoi ran away. Assess according to the following criteria: Is the learner's account of this incident factually correct? Has the learner avoided presenting the incident in a manner which lays all the blame on one party? Is the account well organised and does it present a complete picture of the incident?117 REVISION ACTIVITY MODULE 69. Assess the learners' mind-maps on the following criteria: Do the learners' answers rev eal insight into the conditions under which people sailed in the 17th and 18th centuries (such as limited fresh food and water and the resultant diseases, the cramped conditions leading to the rapid spread of disease, the dangers of stormy weather, pirate activity, too much or too little wind, and so on)? Do their mind-maps cover a wide range of points (i.e. they have not merely listed four diseases, lack of fresh food, and lack of fresh water as six separate points)?118 Introduction Democracy and citizenship Content and time The suggested teaching time for History is approximately 15 hours per 10-week term (that is, approximately 1\u00bd hours per week of contact time).

Units in this module therefore trace the developments as South Africa was transformed into a democracy after many years of struggle against apartheid. Research project Make sure that you read through Unit 8 in the Learner's Book and this Teacher's Guide before you start your teaching for this term. The project should inform your teaching of all the other units so that learners are well supported in their project work. You should introduce the project early in the term, as the learners should be working on it throughout. 120 Introduction Learners should do some of their project work in lesson time, and some of the work for homework. You therefore need to plan carefully how and when you are going to allocate classroom time to the project. Monitor learners' progress regularly, throughout the project (e.g. allocate 10-15 minutes at the end of a lesson for learners to talk about how far they have progressed, and so that you can help learners with any problems they encounter).121 UNIT 1 MODULE 7Unit 11Unit Democratic change Learner's Book pages 140-141 1 hour Curriculum content and concepts The first democratic government in South Africa 1994 Political parties and voting in national elections Teaching notes You will need: Start this Module with the Activity in 'What do you know already?' on page 139 in the Learner's Book. Take feedback in the form of a brief class discussion. Explore what your learners know about the word 'democracy' in relation to South Africa. You could ask a learner to read out the meaning from the word list on page 179 in the Learner's Book. Explain that democracy and how to be a good member of or participant in a democracy is going to be the theme for this term's work. Let learners examine the picture on page 140 in the Learner's Book, and tell you what is happening (they can ask themselves their 'investigation' questions: who? what? when? why? and so on). Read the introductory text at the top of page 140, and read through the Activity with the class. Explain that they should work alone to do the interviews, and record the answers in their notebooks for report back to class in the next lesson. Don't forget to take brief feedback in the next lesson, and take in the notebooks to check and do informal assessment. Read through the text on pages 140 and 141 with the learners. Remind them that they can look up the meaning of the words in bold, in the word list on page 179. Discuss the last paragraph in relation to the picture of the specimen ballot paper on page 141. Ask them to point to the names of the political parties, the abbreviations for each party, and the logos and photographs of the representatives of each party. Show them where people would make their cross to vote. Ask learners to work in pairs on the Activity at the bottom of page 141. BRIGHT IDEA! Vote for us! You will need: paper and coloured pencils or crayons Tell learners that they are going to form political parties and organise their own election campaign. In groups, they will decide on their party's name, design a logo for it, draw a promotional poster and prepare their election speech. !122 UNIT 1 MODULE 7 Briefly discuss political parties, and what makes one political party different from another (usually the issues they focus on, and the promises they make to voters). Discuss the kinds of issues the learners could focus on. They should be issues related to the learners' own lives that they feel strongly about (e.g. the environment, school issues, animal rights, and so on). In groups, let learners decide what issues their party will focus on, and what their promises will be. They should decide on a name for their party, and design a logo for their party. Point out that it's a good idea if the name and their logo is related to the issue, or issues, they will focus on. In designing their poster, they should include a brief, strong statement about what their party stands for (i.e. a slogan). Together they should work out an election speech, and select who their 'representative' will be. This is the person who will make the speech to the class. The speech should not be more than two minutes long. When they are ready, the 'parties' can take turns to present themselves, their logo and their poster to the class, and the representative gives the speech. The class can vote for the party who, in their opinion, was the most convincing.

They should create an election poster for their party, and prepare a short electoral speech to present to the class (see Bright Idea!).should have noted answers to two extra questions of their own. The two additional questions should be relevant to the issue of the question.Pair Activity, page 141 1. Can learners extract rele vant information from a picture? Can learners interpret information in a picture? 2. Can learners draw conclusions fr om information in a text?124 UNIT 2 MODULE 7Unit 12Unit The Constitution and Parliament Learner's Book pages 142-143 1 hour Curriculum content and concepts The purpose of the Constitution The role of Parliament Teaching notes You will need: dictionaries; blank paper for each learner; coloured pencils or crayons Find out if any of your learners know what the Constitution is. Let them discuss their ideas, then tell them to find the definition on page 179 of the Learner's Book and read it out. Read and discuss the first two paragraphs on page 142 of the Learner's Book with the class. Ask leading questions to establish that they understand it: e.g. Why does the government have to obey the Constitution? Who made up the Constitution? Why did it take so long to draw it up? Read and discuss the next two paragraphs on page 142 and at the top of page143 with the class If there are words they don't understand, encourage them to use the dictionaries in the classroom. If you don't have dictionaries, make sure they at least understand the words 'social values' (things that society, i.e. we, think are valuable or important, e.g. fairness, freedom, equal chances to do things like go to school, etc.), 'principles', which can be explained simply as 'rules', and 'commissions', which you can explain as 'investigations'. Let them re-read the passage quietly to themselves, then ask them to close their books and tell you what they can remember about what the Constitution says. Read through the Individual Activity on page 143 of the Learner's Book, making sure that learners understand what to do. Discuss how they can find the information they need (or see Bright Idea! on the next page). Hand out sheets of paper, make sure everyone has access to coloured pencils or crayons, and let learners complete the Activity. If you want learners to research the information themselves, tell them that they are to complete the Activity in their notebooks, for homework. Remember to let learners share what they have found out about the rights guaranteed to us by our Constitution, at the beginning of the next lesson. Read and discuss the final paragraph and the Flash Facts with the class and talk about what Parliament does. Let learners discuss the Activity at the bottom of page 143 of the Learner's Book in groups. When you think they have had enough time, let them share their ideas with another group.125 UNIT 2 MODULE 7BRIGHT IDEA! You may like to use this as a listening Activity, related to the Individual Activity on page 143, if you think learners will not have access to the resources needed to do the Activity. Read all, or selected parts of it to the class. Learners must choose one right to work on. Summary of the South African Bill of Rights Equality: You cannot be discriminated against.

Source: http://adventurequalifications.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/ summary-of-the-south-african-bill-of-rights.pdf!126 UNIT 2 MODULE 7Answers to activities Individual Learner's Book page 143 Make sure that the right the learner has chosen to illustrate is one of those guaranteed by our Constitution (see Bright Idea!). Group Learner's Book page 143 1. a) Learners may choose to answer 'yes' or 'no ', and they may also choose to answer 'yes and no' provided they can give good arguments in support of their answers. b) Learners will come up with a variety of answers. Accept all well r easoned answers. Some ideas may include: The government may ignore what the majority of people in the country want and need. They may do things and make decisions without explaining why to people. They can get greedy and keep things like money and land for themselves. The government may become very cruel and uncaring about people who are poor, starving or sick. The government may therefore begin to ignore the rights of the people who voted them into power. If the government really becomes too powerful, they eventually destroy democracy and justice. (The key issue for learners to have grasped is that in a democracy everyone is equal and government is voted into (or 'given') power by citizens on the basis of promises they have made to the citizens, and to whom they must report back on progress in achieving those promises.) Informal assessment Individual Activity, page 143 Has the learner illustrated a right that is guaranteed by our Constitution? Has the learner drawn a picture that illustrates the right clearly? (It does not have to be a beautiful drawing, as all learners' talents are different, but the drawing should be clear and relevant.) Is the caption relevant to the picture and the right? Has the learner written a caption - i.e. a short sentence or phrase, not more?Group Activity, page 143Have learners grasped the importance of shared power in the concept of democracy? Can learners give a reasoned argument in support of their ideas and opinions? Are they willing to listen to the ideas and opinions of others, and can they respond with calm, reasoned counter-arguments?

To help him, write down five important facts about the Constitution of South Africa. Extension learners: Let learners work in groups to imagine that they are going to form a club (they must decide what kind of club it is, perhaps a music club, or a book club, or a Saturday club, a science club, etc.) They must write a constitution for the club that everyone agrees to.128 UNIT 3 MODULE 7Unit 13Unit Rules, laws and the justice system Learner's Book pages 144-145 2 hours Curriculum content and concepts The importance of rules and laws The justice system and equality under the law Teaching notes You will need: dictionaries Conduct a brief class brainstorm about the key question for this unit: Why are rules and laws important? Record the key ideas learners come up with on the board. Read and discuss the text at the top of page 144 of the Learner's Book. Make sure that learners can tell you what a court is, and the difference between civil and criminal law - see if they can think of examples of an argument which would need to be settled by civil law (e.g. two parties who each blame the other for an accident might be settled by civil law; if married couples want to divorce each other, the settlement between them is decided by civil law). Let learners work in groups to discuss the questions in the Activity on page 144 of the Learner's Book. Walk around while they are busy to assess informally and perhaps make a contribution to one or two of the discussions. Open the discussion to the class as a whole, and let them draw conclusions about whether it really would be a good idea to have no rules in schools and no laws in a country. Explain the Activity at the bottom of page 144 in the Learner's Book, and tell learners to answer it individually in their notebooks. Read and discuss the text on page 145 with the class. Give simple explanations so that learners understand what it means when we say that courts are 'independent' (the only authority they need to obey is the law); 'impartial' (they don't favour any one person or party above another); 'accessible' (everybody can use them) and 'effective' (they do what they are supposed to do: settle arguments). Ask leading questions to check learners' understanding of the different kinds of courts, and the hierarchy in which they are organised. Tell learners to re-read the text quietly with a partner, and complete the Activity at the bottom of page 145. If there is time, let learner pairs join up to ask each other their extra questions. Reminder! Learners should have started on their projects by now. Answers to activities Group Learner's Book page 144There are no right or wrong answers in this Activity, but learners' ideas should show a reasonable grasp of the need for rules to ensure that people 129 UNIT 3 MODULE 7respect the rights of others and take seriously the part they can play in making it possible for everyone to live safely and peacefully together. Individual Learner's Book page 144Learners' answers should reveal understanding of the consequences of unlimited freedoms.Some sample answers: Firecrackers would keep people awake at night; could cause very serious harm to people and animals; could cause fires. Littering could cause serious disease; could make places so ugly that no tourists would visit; would cause pollution; would make the area smelly; could attract things like rats and cockroaches that people don't want; could block up places that need to be kept open. Underage drinking could cause very serious health damage to children; could cause accidents and crimes; could stop children from coping at school. Urinating in public would create disease; make the environment smelly; could harm the environment. Speeding would increase the number of accidents and deaths; hospitals would not cope with the demand for their services; car wrecks would be everywhere; it would be more and more unsafe for law-obeying citizens to drive on the roads and more and more unsafe for pedestrians. Noise pollution would keep people awake when they need to sleep; would damage people's and animals' hearing; would make people and animals very stressed and angry and could cause them to get sick. Illegal dumping would damage the environment and create pollution; this would create health problems; people would fight with one another if they dumped in one another's areas; it would also make the area look very ugly and it could become very smelly. Pair Learner's Book page 145 1. a) Small claims court; b) community court or traditional court; c) Constitutional Court. 2. Some examples: High court - you' ve been found guilty and you don't agree that you are guilty, or one of your employees has committed fraud against you, resulting in a loss of R150 000 from your business; magistrate's court - your house has been robbed; someone tried to steal your car; small claims court - someone sold you a brand new TV which broke after two weeks and the shop won't replace it; you got very sick after eating in a restaurant and they say it wasn't their fault; equality court: someone keeps calling you horrible names in public; you compete with someone for the same job and think that the other person gets the job because the employer is a friend of that person; traditional court: you want a divorce and you are married according to customary laws; community court: your neighbour borrowed your kettle and now says it is his kettle; someone stole a T-shirt from your shop.130 UNIT 3 MODULE 7Informal assessment Group Activity, page 144: Can learners see the consequences of individual action and the effects on broader society? Individual Activity, page 144: Did learners answer the question asked (i.e. three laws were chosen)? Do learners' answers show the ability to predict the effects of ignoring laws intended to help people live together successfully? Is all the information provided relevant, and logically organised? Pair Activity, page 145: Do learners understand the difference between the various types of court? Did they know the answers to their own questions? Additional resources Helpful explanation of the courts in South Africa, with links to the various courts:http://www.westerncape.gov.za/eng/pubs/public_info/C/32303 Remedial and extension activities Remedial learners: Write a paragraph explaining why we need rules and laws. Extension learners: Work in groups. You have been stranded on an island in the middle of nowhere with a group of strangers. Decide on five laws that your group agrees are important. Write them down, and explain why each one is important.131 UNIT 4 MODULE 7Unit 14Unit Rights and responsibilities Learner's Book pages 146-147 1 hour Curriculum content and concepts Rights come with responsibilities Fatima Meer as an anti-apartheid activist and campaigner for human rights and social justice Teaching notes You will need: dictionaries Ask learners if they have the right to be upset with their friend, or sister or brother. Ask them if they have the right to talk to that person about it. Do they have the right to hit that person who upset them, even if that is what they feel like doing? Talk about the responsibilities that come with rights - learners have the right to talk to someone who has upset them, but the duty to do so without hurting or harming that person. Learners have the right to be listened to, but also the responsibility or duty to listen to others. Read the text at the top of page 146 with learners and let them do the activity below, individually, in their notebooks. Ask learners to work in pairs to read and discuss the case study about Fatima Meer on page 147 in the Learner's Book. Encourage them to use dictionaries if there are words that prevent them understanding what they have read (point out, though, that you do not always have to know the exact meaning of every word to understand what you read). Before learners go on to do the second question individually, ask a few leading questions to check their understanding of what they have read, and briefly explain what passes were and what the Group Areas Act did. Take in their notebooks to check and do informal assessment. BRIGHT IDEA! Research project: mid-term checking and consultation You may find that now is a good time to informally assess learners' progress with their research projects. After doing the activity on Fatima Meer, it might also be a good time to work through the activity in Step 3 of Unit 8 (Learner's Book page 155). Warn learners to bring their 'schedules' and what they have done so far to class. Tell learners how much time you are going to give them to continue on their projects in class, and explain that during this time, you will be available to help with any questions they have. While they are working, walk around to assess informally and make a note of any learners who are very far behind, so that you can monitor their progress more closely from now on.!132 UNIT 4 MODULE 7Answers to activities Individual Learner's Book page 146 1.

Fatima Meer helped to build democracy in South Africa in many different ways. She was one of the women who started the Federation of South African Women, who led the march against the pass laws in 1956. She fought against the Group Areas Act and supported the rights of people who were sent to prison without a trial. She tried to organise a rally with Steve Biko and started the Native Education T rust to raise funds for building five schools in the townships. She was very involved in all kinds of community work: she helped women in informal settlements by teaching them, she fought for the rights of shack-dwellers and rural migrants and she organised scholarships for African students. She paid a heavy price for her activism. She was banned for two years, she was detained without trial, and someone even tried to kill her. She was a very brave woman who contributed a lot to creating democracy in South Africa. Informal assessment Individual Activity, page 146: 1. Can the learners match right s with responsibilities? 2. Can learners distinguish bet ween a right and a responsibility? Are they able to transfer this knowledge to their own lives? Pair and Individual Activity, page 147:2. Can the learner select information r elevant to the question? Can the learner present the information in logical sequence? Did the learner introduce the topic and provide a relevant concluding sentence? To what extent can learners use their own words to repeat the information given in the Learner's Book?133 UNIT 4 MODULE 7Additional resources http://www.sahistory.org.za/people/fatima-meerhttp://www.sahistory.org.za/womens-struggle-1900-1994/1956-womens-march-pretoria-9-augusthttp://www.sahistory.org.za/article/women039s-resistance-against-pass-laws Remedial and extension activities Remedial learners: Write down three human rights that Fatima Meer fought to protect. Extension learners: Imagine that you are Fatima Meer. Write a pamphlet aimed at getting community awareness and support for any of the anti-apartheid activities she engaged in. 134 Unit 15Unit The Constitutional Court Learner's Book pages 148-149 2 hours UNIT 5 MODULE 7Curriculum content and concepts The Constitutional Court is the highest court in South Africa Pius Langa as a founding member of the Constitutional Court and Chief Justice from 2005 to 2009 Teaching notes Ask the class to tell you what they remember about the Constitution. What is the Constitution? Why do we have the Constitution? Who approved it? Can anyone remember what the Constitutional Court does? Refer learners to page 145 of the Learner's Book if they can't give you an answer. Read and discuss the text and picture at the top of page 148 in the Learner's Book with the class. See if any learners can think of an example of a disagreement that would be taken to the Constitutional Court. Make sure that learners understand that the Constitutional Court decides on things related to the Constitution, and that even the government has to obey it. So one example of a disagreement might be if the government wanted to bring back the death penalty (capital punishment). The Constitutional Court abolished the death penalty in 1995, so the government's desire to change the law would have to be settled in the Constitutional Court. Let a few good readers take turns to read a paragraph of the case study about Pius Langa. Make sure that they understand that the Chief Justice is the head of the Constitutional Court. Ask leading questions to check understanding, e.g. How did Pius Langa manage to finish school if his family had no money? And how did he then also manage to qualify as a lawyer? How do you think he contributed to building democracy in South Africa? Remind learners about their projects, and point out that they could refer to the biography on Justice Langa for guidance on how to organise their information when they write their biographies. Read through the Activity with the class and make sure they understand Justice Langa's statement, e.g. who might be the weakest among us? (children, the elderly, the sick, etc.) and who might be the worst among us? (murderers, rapists, and so on). Help them understand the second sentence by relating it to our rights and responsibilities: we have a right to be angry with people who do things such as murder or rape, and we have a right to judge or condemn them as criminal and bad, but we also have the responsibility to preserve life; to respect everyone's right to life.135 UNIT 5 MODULE 7 Lead a class discussion about whether or not they agree with Pius Langa that we should not ourselves become guilty of killing people because we want to punish them for killing someone. Before you start, ask the learners what their rights and responsibilities are in a discussion like this (e.g. the right to voice your opinion; the right to be heard; the responsibility to allow the opinions of others, even if you disagree; the responsibility to listen to what others have to say without interrupting; and so on) - the object of this is simply to have agreement on a few 'rules' so that the discussion remains civil, even if it becomes heated. BRIGHT IDEA! You might like to turn the Activity on page 149 of the Learner's Book into a debate: Let the class discuss the topic in groups. Ask one group who agrees with Justice Langa, and one group who disagrees with him, to volunteer for the debate, and select or ask a volunteer to chair the debate and keep time. (If the groups are large, they must select no more than three of their members to speak on their behalf.) Remind learners about the rules of a debate, or ask them to remind you: one speaker at a time; any speaker who interrupts or shouts is disqualified; each speaker has three minutes (or however much time you think is appropriate for your learners). Tell the learners that you will open the debate 'to the floor', i.e. to the class, so they should listen carefully, make notes and prepare questions about the arguments of the speakers if they want to challenge the speaker, or want more information from them. ! Answers to activity Class Learner's Book page 149 See guidelines under Informal assessment. Informal assessment There are no right or wrong answers to this question. What is important to assess is: Do the learners' discussions reveal a grasp of the concept of human rights and responsibilities? Can they apply this to a complex question? Are they able to see the same issue from different points of view? Do they listen to one another's views? Do they think critically and ask questions? Additional resources http://www.constitutionalcourt.org.za/site/home.htmhttp://www.constitutionalcourt.org.za/site/judges/justicepiuslanga/index1.html136 UNIT 5 MODULE 7Remedial and extension activities Remedial learners: Under the title 'Pius Langa: Fact File' write what you think are five important things that everyone should know about Pius Langa. Extension learners: Imagine that you are Nelson Mandela. Write a document motivating why you would like to appoint Pius Langa as one of the first judges of the new Constitutional Court.137 UNIT 6 MODULE 7Unit 16Unit Children's rights and responsibilities Learner's Book pages 150-151 2 hours Curriculum content and concepts The purpose of the Children's Charter The rights of children Teaching notes Find out what your learners know about their rights as children. Talk about times when they feel their rights were not respected - what happened, and why? Who did they think had treated them unfairly? How did that make them feel? What would have made it better? Talk also about times when perhaps they have treated others unfairly. What happened and why, and did they do anything to make it better? How do they feel about what they did? Read the introductory text on page 150 of the Learner's Book, and then ask individual learners to read out one right from the Children's Charter on pages 150-151. After each right has been read out, discuss it with the class. Ask them to think of examples where some of these rights have been violated, and talk about what children can do to get help (see Bright Idea!). Let learners work in pairs to do the Activity on page 150. They should discuss in pairs, but write the paragraphs individually, in their notebooks. Ask a few learner pairs to present their answers to the class, allowing a few minutes of class discussion after each presentation. Briefly discuss what learners see in the photographs on page 151 of the Learner's Book, how? and so on. Then let them work in groups to do the Activity at the bottom of the page. BRIGHT IDEA! You could use this as a listening and note-taking activity with your learners: Where you can go for help Childline: Tollfree 24 hour helpline 0800 055 555 Child Protection Units (a division of the South African Police): Phone head office in Pretoria to find out the branch nearest you: (012) 320 3625, or 082 809 2112 Child and Family Welfare: contact the National Council for Child and Family Welfare for the branch nearest you: Phone (011) 339 57 41, or email info@childwelfaresa.org.za South African Society for the Prevention of Child Abuse and Neglect (SASPCAN): Phone (011) 481 5145 or email saspcan@absamail.com Emergency telephone number: 10 111 The Teddy Bear Clinic for abused children: Phone (011) 484 4554!138 UNIT 6 MODULE 7Answers to activities Pair Learner's Book page 150 2. a) This is a sample answer, intended to indicate what might be acceptable: (1) All children have the right to practise their own religion, culture or beliefs. I think this is important because in South Africa there are many different people with different religions and cultures, like Christian, Muslim, Jewish and Hindu. It would not be fair to let some people practise their beliefs but not others, and people believe very strongly in their religions and get upset if you try to take it away from them. (2) All children have the right to be protected from neglect and abandonment. This is very important because children are still young and don't know how to do everything for themselves. So they need someone to take care of them and make sure they are safe, healthy and get food. (3) All children have the right to love and affection from their parents and family. I think this is important because the family's love is what makes children feel safe and happy. If children don't get love and are unhappy, they can run away from home and do crime and get into trouble. 2. b) This is a sample answer, intended to indicate what might be acceptable: (1) Children have the responsibility to respect the religion, cultur e and beliefs of other children, and not to mock them or laugh at them. (2) Children have the responsibility to help any children who are neglected or abandoned, and when they grow up they have the responsibility to not neglect or abandon their children. (3) All children have the responsibility to love and be affectionate to their parents and family. Group Learner's Book page 1512. In the first photo, the right of the child to protection from all types of violence is being violated and/or the right to protection from to wnship and political violence and to have safe places to go to. In the second photo, the right of the child to be protected from hard labour is being violated. In the third photo, the right of the child to clothing, housing and a healthy diet is being violated and/or the right to love and affection from parents and family. 3. Some suggestions only, learners will have many ideas of their own. The child in the first picture: Could be given a false leg; other children could help her when she is crossing a busy road; other childr en could help her by making friends with her and inviting her to join in games in ways that she can, e.g. she could be the referee; organisations could teach children like her how to cope when there are things they can't do. The children in the second photo: report the employer who is using them illegally; visit them after school to help them with what they missed in their lessons; create organisations that work to help parents who send their children to work for different reasons; create a special unit in the police force to visit farms and stop child labour.139 UNIT 6 MODULE 7 The children in the third photo: You could create houses where homeless childr en can live; you could work to raise money to feed and clothe children who don't have families, you could take one child into your home if your parents can afford that; perhaps we could have boarding schools for homeless children without families. Informal assessment Pair Activity, on page 150: a) Can learners explain why children 's rights are important? b) Can learners see rights fr om another perspective - that of responsibility? Group Activity, page 151:2. Do the learners' answers sho w that they understand the meaning of children's rights? Can they match the relevant right/s with the relevant photo? 3. Can learners think critically and creativ ely to solve problems? Do their answers reveal insight into the needs of the children in each photo? Additional resources http://www.childlinesa.org.za/http://www.saps.gov.za/children/childrens_corner.htmhttp://www.crin.org/organisations/vieworg.asp?id=2216 Remedial and extension activities Remedial learners: Learners can work in pairs or groups. Make a poster to illustrate the children's right you think is the most important. Your poster should include a drawing, a short explanation of the right, and some information about where children can go for help if they need it. Extension learners: Learners should work in threes. T wo learners role play a situation where a child is being treated unfairly, and the third takes the part of a Childline counsellor who helps them to solve the problem.140 UNIT 7 MODULE 7Unit 17Unit National symbols since 1994 Learner's Book pages 152-153 2 hours Curriculum content and concepts South Africa's national flag Our national anthem The national coat of arms Teaching notes You will need: coloured pencils or crayons; a large sheet of blank paper for each learner group; photocopies of the national anthem (Extra resources) Ask learners if they can explain what a symbol is. (They should remember this from map work in Geography.) Let them think of some examples of symbols, then talk about national symbols as symbols of a country. Ask if they can think of any national symbols of South Africa, or if perhaps they know about the national symbols of other countries. Read the text at the top of page 152 with the class, and discuss the caption to the picture of the flag. Let them copy the picture, individually, into their Learner's Books and give them a few minutes to colour it in. They can finish it for homework if they work slowly. Let learners read the text about the history of the national anthem quietly to themselves. When they have finished, they should close their books and tell you what they remember. If you have made photocopies of the national anthem, hand them out and sing the anthem together. If not, write the anthem on the board, let learners copy it into their notebooks and then sing the anthem together. Discuss which languages are used in the anthem and ask learners what they think about the idea of combining the 'apartheid' anthem with the 'anti-apartheid' anthem, and of using the different languages. Talk about badges with the class. Does your school have a badge? Do learners belong to any clubs, or can they think of clubs that also have badges? Why do people make badges? If your school has a badge, does it have a meaning? Learners should be able to draw the conclusion that most badges have symbolic meaning, and usually indicate things that are important, or valued by the people wearing the badge. Read the text on page 153 of the Learner's Book with the learners, and briefly discuss the picture of the coat of arms. Read through the Activity and make sure learners understand what to do. Discuss how they could find information about South Africa's other national symbols - do they know which government department they could write to?red blue greenblack yellowwhitewhite141 UNIT 7 MODULE 7Answers to activities Group Learner's Book page 153 2.

See guidelines for informal assessment.BRIGHT IDEA! Research project check-in At this point, you may want to give the learners some time again to work on their projects in class - you decide how much time you can make available. Warn learners ahead of time, so that they know to bring their work and everything they need to school. Tell learners how much class time you will allocate for their projects - will you give them a whole lesson? Or half a lesson? Assess their progress informally, and note learners that you need to chase, or to whom you need to give more guidance. ! Informal assessment Group Activity, page 153: 1. The learners' answ ers do not have to be 100 % correct, but they should reveal that learners can identify things that South Africa as a whole might consider important and valuable; and should be evidence of the learners' ability to think creatively and draw inferences. 2. a) Does the learner's c oat of arms symbolise what their family values, or believes to be important? Are the symbols appropriate? b) Is the learner's answer factually correct? Has the learner acknowledged the source(s) of information? Does the report explain why the symbol has been chosen? Let learners work in groups to complete the Activity on page 153. They can work in their notebooks, or you may prefer them to work on large sheets of paper so that their work can be displayed in the classroom.142 UNIT 7 MODULE 7Additional resources Photocopies of the South African National Anthem (and translation), Extra resourceshttp://www.southafrica.info/about/history/national-symbols.htmhttp://www.dwaf.gov.za/Communications/Coat%20of%20Arms/coatofarms.htmhttp://www.delvillewood.com/armoiries2.htm Remedial and extension activities Remedial learners: Write a paragraph about your favourite national symbol of South Africa, and say why it is your favourite (what makes it special to you). Extension learners: Work in pairs, and do whichever activity (2. a or b) you have not already done.143 UNIT 8 MODULE 7Unit 18Unit Research project: A biography Learner's Book pages 154-155 2 hours Curriculum content and concepts Research the life story of a person who has helped build democracy in South Africa Qualities of a good leader Using sources: collect relevant information about the person's life Record information Organise information: draw up a plan First draft, revision, final neat life story Teaching notes You will need: a calendar Talk to the learners about their project for this year. Discuss the first paragraph, and help learners to think about their choice of leader. Encourage them to talk about famous South African leaders that they know about, and why they admire them. Point out that they can think about places and streets that are named after leaders, for ideas. Make sure that learners understand that they can choose one of the leaders suggested in the Learner's Book on page 154, or they can choose their own leader, but it must be someone who has helped to build democracy in South Africa. Talk about everything the learners will need to do, in order to complete their project by the end of term. Brainstorm a 'To do' list with them, e.g. choose a leader; decide what information I need; decide how to get that information; start collecting the information and take notes; draw up a plan for my biography; and so on. Record the 'To do' list on one side of the board. Give the learners a date by when their projects must be handed in for assessment. Next to your 'To do' list on the board, write the heading 'Dates' and then write the due date next to their last step on the 'to do' list (which should be 'Hand in project'). Tell learners to use a calendar to work out how many weeks they have to do their project, then help them to work out how much time they will need for each task, and agree on dates for the completion of each. Learners can copy this down in their notebooks, or if you have made copies of the project schedule for them, hand them out and let them fill in dates (see Extra resources). Point out the importance of using their 'schedules' to help them monitor their own progress, and to consult you for help if they are falling behind. Work through the Step 2 activity with learners. Talk about how they would explain why they have chosen their particular leader, reminding them about the work they did about the qualities 144 UNIT 8 MODULE 7of good leaders in Grade 4 (works for the good of others; has courage; dedicated to their beliefs; prepared to sacrifice for the sake of others or their beliefs; and so on). Discuss the information they want to include in their biography, so that they know what information they need to get. Talk about the different ways they can get information, and help them to decide where to keep their notes so that they can find them easily (perhaps at the back of their notebooks, under headings?). Stress that they must use their own words, and for each piece of information, they should note down the sources of their information. Learners must now start the research in their own time. Get them to check the date by when they should have completed this, and discuss any dates and times when you will be available to help, as well as any dates when you will give them lesson time. Work through the Step 3 activity with the class. Talk about why the way we organise information is important (organising information well makes it possible for the reader to follow and understand and enjoy; we can put interesting or important information at the beginning to get the reader interested; if we sum up information at the end, it's easy for the reader to remember the main point of what they've read, and so on). Let learners compare how the information is organised in the Fatima Meer and Pius Langa biographies (Learner's Book pages 147 and 148-149). Can they see a different way of organising the information in either of these biographies? Let learners start their rough outline. If you think they need more help, you could ask them to help you draw up a rough outline of either the Meer or the Langa biography on the board. Show them how to start with key words for the main idea, and then list sub-ideas underneath, also using key words, not full sentences. They must continue their rough outlines at home - get learners to check the date by when they should have finished this, as well as any dates when you will give them lesson time and will also be checking their progress. Read and discuss the Step 4 activity with learners. Get them to help you summarise the process in a flowchart on the board: Draft -> Revise -> Review -> Correct -> Proofread -> Final. Briefly discuss each of these steps and stress that the revision stage is very important. Ask learners to change each of the bulleted statements in number 2 into a question they can ask themselves, to assess their writing, e.g. Are all my sentences clear and easy to understand? Read the Top Tips and make sure learners understand how to use the 'transition' words (you could ask the language teacher to help learners). Discuss who the learners could ask to read and comment on (i.e. review) their biographies. Tell learners the dates and times when you will be available to help them, and any further class time you 145 UNIT 8 MODULE 7will give them. Finally, remind them of the date when you expect them to hand in their final work. BRIGHT IDEA! You may like to organise the project work as follows: Early in the term introduce the project and help learners to select the topic for their biography (Unit 8 Step 1). Work through Unit 8 Step 2 with them, and make sure they have some sort of schedule that helps them to plan and monitor their own progress. It might also be a good idea to give learners a set time during the week when you will be available to help them with any serious problems they experience (e.g. you could make yourself available for an hour after school once or twice a week, or during the lunch break once or twice a week, depending on how much help you think your learners might need). If it is difficult for your learners to access a library (e.g. if they live far away and there is no transport) try to borrow books from a library yourself, and keep them in the classroom for learners to consult. Libraries are often very helpful and willing to come to a special arrangement with teachers so that they can loan books for an extended period for a school project. If you can't access a library, but have access to the Internet and a printer, you could print out information for learners to consult (see Additional resources, below). If you want to use this again in future years, it is a good idea to print out single-sided and paste each page onto both sides of cardboard (e.g. the cardboard at the back of a notepad). You can keep this in plastic sleeves, or use plastic adhesive. Keep a set of these 'biography cards' as a resource for your learners to use for information. Allow a few weeks for learners to collect their information. During this time, allocate a few minutes per week to check in with them regarding their progress and what help they need. Mid-term, ask them to report back on the progress of their information gathering, and work through Steps 3 and 4 of Unit 8 with them. At least two weeks before you expect learners to hand in their projects, make sure that they have drawn up their rough outline for the biography.! Formal assessment Use the rubric on page 42 of the Formal Assessment Programme section to assess each learner's project work. Make sure each learner has a copy so they know exactly how they will be assessed. Informal assessment Progress in discussion and activities. Additional resources Project schedule (see Formal Assessment Programme section (Term 3 FAT: History project)) http://www.sahistory.org.za/people146 REVISION ACTIVITY MODULE 71. Learners will come up with their own ideas. Accept any reasonable answers that are relevant to the issues in the question. N ote that 'What do you think of ...' repeated for each of the three questions is not really acceptable, as it demonstrates that learners have not given much thought to their work. Here are some sample questions and answers, using Fatima Meer as the example chosen: Q: Mrs Meer, what do you think is the most important human right? A: That is a very difficult question. I think all our human rights ar e very important, but if I have to choose, I think the right for every person to vote is essential. That is what I fought for all my life. Q: Why is it so important that our country is a democracy? A: That is a very good question. It's impor tant because it means that everyone has a say in how our country is governed, whether you are rich or poor, highly educated or not. Q: Why are rules and laws so important? A: We need rules and laws so that all the different people in this country can liv e together peacefully and comfortably. 2. a) Elections are when you vote for the political party y ou want in government. b) Voting means putting a cross next to the name of the political party you choose to form a gov ernment (voting means choosing is also an acceptable answer). c) A political party is a group of people who have the same ideas about how the country should be go verned. d) A ballot paper is a piece of paper on which you indicate with a cross which political party you are v oting for. e) A coat of arms is a kind of badge with pictures and writing on it that show the kinds of things that you think are important. 3. Assess learners' answers according to the follo wing guidelines: Is the answer relevant to the question, i.e. has the learner dealt with whether or not learners should have as much say as staff and parents in the running of the school? Has the learner presented a clear point of view? Is this point of view supported by good reasons? Is the information presented logically? Is all the information relevant to the points being made in the argument? 4. Use the following guidelines to assess the learner's ballot paper: H as the learner answered the question asked, i.e. five political parties are listed, and all five are imaginary? Are the names and logos the learner has given to each party suggestive of an issue they stand for? Module 7 Revision activity Learner's Book pages 156-157 2 hours147 REVISION ACTIVITY MODULE 7Are the names and logos clearly differentiated (i.e. they are not all so similar to one another as to be confusing to the voter)? Has the learner included a column or boxes where voters will place their mark? 5. Apartheid ended officially on 27 April 1994. O n that day South Africa became a democracy. All South African adults were finally allowed to vote. They could vote for the political party they wanted in government. Before this, only white people were allowed to vote. Today we celebrate 27 April as Freedom Day. 6. The learner's paragraph should include the follo wing points, which should be presented in logical order: South African Constitution: protect democracy by making sure the government does not have too much power; protect human rights by making sure that the government does its work properly and by creating courts and investigations if rights are abused. Children's Charter: protect children because they can't always protect themselves, protect them from abuse or mistreatment, protect their right to basic needs which will help them grow up peacefully, safely and healthily. 7. Constitutional Court; Supreme Court of Appeal; H igh Court; Magistrate's Court 8. Assess answers on the following guidelines: Do learners ' answers indicate that they understand the difference between rights and responsibilities, but also the logical connections between them, i.e. can they see the same issue from the perspective of a right, and from the perspective of a responsibility? Does the text in their speech bubbles or in their caption relate to the drawing? 9. Accept any other answers that are of relevance to the historical contribution of each person, and ar e factually correct, e.g.: Fatima Meer campaigned for human rights and social justice. She fought against apartheid for more than 50 years. Justice Pius Langa helped to establish the Constitutional Court and he was Chief Justice from 2005 to 2009. 148 Introduction Medicine through time Content and time The suggested teaching time for History is approximately 15 hours per 10-week term (that is, approximately 1\u00bd hours per week of contact time).

In South Africa, indigenous medicine is associated with the herbs, remedies and advice given by sangomas or nyangas. Some healers have a vast knowledge of medicinal plants, and Western companies are continuously discovering more and more pharmaceutical uses for indigenous plants. Indigenous healing takes a holistic approach to illness and treats the patient's spiritual and physical well-being together.150 Introduction In contrast, Western medicine is associated with diseases of the physical body, and is based on the principles of science, technology and knowledge developed mainly in Western Europe and Northern America. Western medicine has in the past often neglected the link between the spiritual and the physical, but a more holistic approach is now commonly part of the teaching in most Western medical schools.151 UNIT 1 MODULE 8Unit 11Unit Indigenous healing Learner's Book pages 160-163 2 hours Curriculum content and concepts Illness has more than physical causes Indigenous healers treat illness holistically Using medicinal plants Teaching notes You will need: your collection of pamphlets about herbal remedies Start this Module with the Activity in 'What do you know already?' on page 159 of the Learner's Book. Have a brief class discussion to compare the different ideas learners have about treating illness and ways of avoiding illness. Let learners look at your collection of pamphlets about natural remedies and therapies, and use this as an introduction to the topic of indigenous healing. Find out if any learners can explain the term 'indigenous healing'. If not, explain that you could call it 'natural healing' because it involves people using the natural things they find around them, to heal people's sicknesses, aches and pains. Read and discuss briefly the introduction on page 160 of the Learner's Book with the class, then tell learners to read the Activity and the speech bubbles quietly to themselves. Make sure they understand the word 'symptom' (a sign or signal that you're getting ill) and 'psychological' (things of the mind, and mental states such as sadness or fear or anger). Ask learners to work in groups to discuss the differences between Western and indigenous medicine. When they are ready, they can share their ideas with another group. While they are busy, walk among them to listen, help and assess informally. Ask a learner to read out the explanations of the two bolded words in the passage on page 161 of the Learner's Book, from the Word list on page 179. Ask a few good readers to take turns reading the text to the class. After each paragraph, ask learners to read out the key or main sentence. Explain the methods used by indigenous healers, if your learners are uncertain about them, e.g. a charm could be a small stone worn around your neck to make sure you don't get a sore throat; an incantation is a chant, something like a short, repetitive prayer; infusions are made when people soak something in water, like we soak tea leaves or teabags in water; a poultice is like a warm lotion or cream made from plants and other natural things. Throughout the discussions in this Unit, make sure that learners understand that indigenous medicine is not limited to Africa; it has been and still is practised to a greater or lesser degree 152 UNIT 1 MODULE 8throughout the world - in Europe, China, India, America, and so on. Let learners work in groups to do the Activity on page 161 of the Learner's Book, then take feedback in the form of a class discussion. Ask learners to share their experiences of using plants or other natural substances to treat things like a headache, or a sore throat, or toothache and so on (e.g. using oils made from lavender for a headache, or gargling with salt for a sore throat, or using cloves to soothe toothache, etc.). Read and discuss the text and picture on page 162 of the Learner's Book with the class, helping them with any words that create difficulty for them. Ask learners whether they think natural or herbal remedies are always completely safe. Talk with them about this briefly, and stress that medicinal plants contain chemical properties that are believed to help heal medical conditions. They should therefore never try making any medicines from plants without the supervision of an adult who knows what they are doing. If they go out, find a buchu plant and start chewing the leaves, they may well make themselves rather sick! Ask learners to read the Individual Activity on page 163 quietly to themselves, and make sure that everyone understands what to do. They should take notes from the interview, and write up their answers under the headings given in the Activity, in their notebooks. Don't forget to ask a few learners to present their findings to the class at the beginning of the next lesson. Take the notebooks in to check on learners' work and do informal assessment. Ask the class if anyone can explain what you mean when you speak of 'pharmaceutical uses for indigenous South African plants' (using plants that grow wild in South Africa, to make medicines or remedies that you can buy from a pharmacy, or chemist). Read the text on page 163 of the Learner's Book with learners. Ask questions to ensure they understand the text (e.g. What part of the plant is used to make Kaloba? Who makes it? What is it used for? Why are some medicinal plants nearly extinct? and so on). Check that learners know what the registered trademark means (it means that Kaloba is a product made by a particular company and legally registered, so that no other company can make exactly the same product). Ask learners to work in groups to discuss the question in the Activity on page 163. Let the groups share some of their ideas with the class.153 UNIT 1 MODULE 8BRIGHT IDEA! Herbal remedies recipe book You will need: learners' answers to the Individual Activity on page 163 of the Learner's Book, blank sheets of paper, pens, coloured crayons or pencils, coloured paper or card for the cover of the book, a stapler, a punch, a length of cotton or string Based on learners' answers to the Individual Activity on page 163 of the Learner's Book, learners could work together as a class to put together their book of herbal remedies. This is what they would do: Ask learners to work in groups to list the recipes according to the plants used. Take feedback, and help the class finalise their list of contents for the book, based on the plants used. Let learners form groups according to each plant in the contents list. They should collect all the recipes for their plant, and decide which ones to include in the book. When they are ready, learners should join up with another group working on the same plant, to make their final choices of which recipes to include. You may have more groups than there are plants used. Ask some groups to brainstorm the content of a page about how to use herbal remedies safely. Others could brainstorm the content of a page on how to save an endangered species of plant. When they are ready, they should join up with another group working on the same topic to finalise the content of their pages. Let groups report back to the class, and help them to finalise what will be included in their book. Help them to decide on a suitable title for their recipe book. Learners could work in pairs to write up and illustrate their recipes, as well as their pages on how to use them safely and how to save endangered plants. Remind them to identify the source for each recipe (presumably the name of the person from whom the learner obtained the selected recipe). Ask learners who you know are good at drawing, to pair up and work on designing and illustrating a cover for the book. Help the learners assemble the book with staples, or by punching holes and sewing or tying it together with cotton or string. ! Answers to activities Group Learner's Book page 160 Western medicine Indigenous medicine only treats physical things treats spiritual, psychological and physical things involves ancestors and dreams uses science and technology uses herbs and medicinal plants knowledge developed in the West practised by African diviners and herbaliststreats symptoms treats causes and symptoms Group Learner's Book page 161: There are no right or wrong answers to this Activity. What is important is that learners are willing to listen with interest to one another's ideas about explaining the causes of illness.154 UNIT 1 MODULE 8Individual Learner's Book page 163: See under Informal assessment for guidelines. Group Learner's Book page 163 Learners will come up with their own ideas. Here are a few sample answers to the question: for every plant you dig up or use, plant another of the same kind; organise campaigns to educate people about endangered indigenous plants; teach local people how to grow and collect the seeds of endangered plants; do not allow people to harvest huge amounts of plants from the wild, instead they must grow crops of the plant needed; have strict laws about exporting indigenous plants. Informal assessment Group Activity, page 160: Are learners able to distinguish between Western and indigenous medicine? Group Activity on page 161: Are learners able to see the issue of explaining what causes illness from more than one point of view? Did all learners contribute to the discussion? Did learners listen to one another with interest, and encourage each member of the group to talk? Individual Activity, page 163: Can the learner source information by asking questions? Can the learner record information accurately? Has the learner included all the information needed in order for someone to use the plant cure? Is the explanation of how to use it and what it is used for logical, complete and clear? Group Activity, page 163: Do learners' ideas show understanding of the causes of over-harvesting? Are they able to come up with creative solutions to the problem? Do their ideas show awareness of the importance of heritage and conservation? Can they create a logically organised summary of their ideas in the form of a mind-map? Did learners encourage everyone in the group to participate? Additional resources www.info.gov.za/events/2011/mandela-day/children-parliament.pdf Remedial and extension activities Remedial learners: Draw a poster, to be put up in public places in your community, about how to save endangered medicinal plants. Learners could work in groups, using their mind-maps from the Activity on page 163 to help them. Extension learners could work in groups, also using their mind-maps from the Activity on page 163, to prepare a speech, which they will give to Parliament during the next Children's Parliament, advocating the protection of valuable medicinal plant species. (For information about the Children's Parliament, see Additional resources above.)155 UNIT 2 MODULE 8Unit 12Unit Becoming a healer Learner's Book pages 164-165 1 hour Curriculum content and concepts Different reasons for and different ways of becoming a healer Becoming a sangoma Becoming an inyanga Teaching notes Let learners share what they know about traditional healers, in small groups. Walk around while they are busy to listen and ask questions about what they say. Read through the text on page 164 with the class. The text may be difficult for some learners as the concepts are quite abstract, so check their understanding through questions, and help with simple explanations where possible (e.g. a 'trance-like' state is something like being in a dream but you are awake; being a 'medium' means that the sangoma is a person through whom the ancestral spirits can speak; the 'context' of an illness would include the person's life circumstances at the time - the things they are worried or upset about for example, or whether they have done something wrong or harmful, etc.) Include the Flash Facts in your reading with the class, and ask them to suggest why sangomas are also known as diviners or counsellors. Read through the Group Activity with the class. Ask two different learners to read each statement. Make sure everyone understands what the two different points of view are, then let the learners discuss the question in groups. Ask learners to read the passage about inyangas on page 165 of the Learner's Book quietly to themselves, including the Flash Facts. When they are ready, ask them to close their books and tell you what they remember. Summarise their answers on the board, then ask the class to help you list the ways in which sangomas are different from inyangas. BRIGHT IDEA! Western or traditional medicine? Ask learners to form pairs. Half the pairs in the class are medical practitioners - one is a traditional healer and the other is a Western medical doctor. Explain that these pairs will be consulted by a sick child and mother. They need to think about what their questions to the mother and child will be, and what kinds of treatment they might give. The other half of pairs in the class are a sick child and the child's worried mother or guardian. The mother is not sure which type of medicine will be best for her child, so she decides to see both a Western !156 UNIT 2 MODULE 8Answers to activity Group Learner's Book page 165: The only 'wrong answer' in this Activity is any opinion which is unreasoned and intolerant of other opinions. Additional resources Websites providing further information on traditional medicine in South Africa: http://www.mrc.ac.za/traditionalmedicines/traditionalmedicines.htm http://www.hst.org.za/uploads/files/chapter18_99.pdf Remedial and extension activities Remedial learners: Write a paragraph to explain how people become traditional healers. Extension learners: Imagine that you are a sangoma with many years of experience. Your granddaughter says she hopes to be called to become a sangoma one day. Write her a letter, telling her what you have enjoyed about being a sangoma, and tell her also about some of the things that have been difficult.medical doctor and a traditional healer, after which she and her child will decide. These pairs should decide what health problem the child is experiencing. What are the symptoms? Why is the child unhappy? What is the mother worried about? and so on. Let learners role play the activity, with the patients consulting each medical practitioner separately. When the learners are ready, let the 'patients' talk about which treatment they think they would choose, and why. Informal assessment Group Activity on page 165: This Activity is a question for debate and discussion and is a test of the learners' ability to offer opinions based on clear reasoning, as well as their ability to see the same issue from differing points of view. 157 UNIT 3 MODULE 8Unit 13Unit The fight against infectious disease Learner's Book pages 166-169 4 hours Curriculum content and concepts Edward Jenner and the smallpox vaccination Germs, disease and Louis Pasteur TB and Robert Koch Penicillin and Alexander Fleming Teaching notes You will need: dictionaries; your collection of pamphlets about TB; a large sheet of blank paper or card for each learner group; rulers; coloured pencils and crayons; scissors; glue; photocopies of the TB poster peer assessment sheet (one per group) (Extra resources) Ask the class to tell you about infectious diseases: What are they? Can they give you examples? How does one get an infectious disease? Why are these diseases called 'infectious'? How are they treated? What do we do to prevent infectious diseases from spreading? Read and discuss the text and picture on page 166 of the Learner's Book with the class. Explain that smallpox was a disease that was highly infectious and made people very ugly; you became covered in a rash that turned into blisters that left scars after they had burst. If you were lucky enough to survive, you were left with terrible marks on your skin. Discuss the questions in the Class Activity on page 166. Make sure that learners give you reasons for their opinions about the importance of vaccinations. Tell learners to read quietly to themselves about how Jenner discovered the first vaccine. When they are ready, ask probing questions to check their understanding, e.g. What did Jenner notice about people who caught cowpox? Why did he take pus from the dairy worker's rash and scratch it into James Phipps's hand? How did Jenner prove that cowpox germs protected you from smallpox? Ask learners what they know about the causes of infectious diseases like flu or measles, then read about what people believed in the past in the Flash Facts on page 167 of the Learner's Book with the class. Ask learners to read the passage about germs, disease and Louis Pasteur on page 167 quietly, with a partner. Encourage them to look up words they don't know in a dictionary. When they are ready, ask them to close their books and tell you what they remember. Ask probing questions to test their understanding, e.g. What was Pasteur's theory about the cause of disease? How was this different to what had been believed before? Why do you think this discovery was so important? What process was named after him? Why is this process important?158 UNIT 3 MODULE 8 Read the Individual Activity on page 167 with learners. Let them work in pairs or small groups to discuss how they will find out about pasteurisation. They should find out for homework, and write their notes about pasteurisation in their notebooks. Remember to take feedback on what they have discovered at the beginning of the next lesson, and to do informal assessment of their work. Ask learners to remind you what Pasteur discovered about the causes of disease. Point out that although he discovered that germs cause disease, it was another scientist who discovered that specific germs caused specific diseases, i.e. some germs cause measles and completely different germs cause whooping cough or mumps. Pasteur made many important discoveries but is probably most famous for his discovery of the process of pasteurisation. Now the class will read about another scientist who also made many important discoveries but who is probably most famous for his discovery of the germs that cause TB. Find out what your learners know or perhaps have experienced of TB. Read and discuss the passage and the picture on page 168 of the Learner's Book with the class, explaining any words you think they may have difficulty with. Read through the Group Activity and tell learners to discuss in their groups how they are going to get the information they need. They should do this for homework (or, if you have a good selection of pamphlets about TB that they can use and/or books from the library available in the classroom, they can do their research in the lesson). Hand out sheets of paper or card to each group and let them make their TB posters. Let the groups present their posters to the class. If you have made copies of the TB poster peer assessment sheet, give each group a copy. You could tell the class that the three best posters will be displayed in areas around the school, and ask them to assess which three are the best. Let learners read the text about Alexander Fleming on page 169 of the Learner's Book quietly, in pairs. They should make up three questions about the text, and when they are ready, join up with another pair to ask and answer questions. Walk around to assess informally and help as needed. Call the class together again and ask them to summarise the main points they have learned. Let learners work in their pairs again to complete the Activity on page 169.159 UNIT 3 MODULE 8BRIGHT IDEA! All about germs Do the following activity to help learners understand how germs are spread, where we will find them and how to protect ourselves from them.You will need: Vaseline; paper towel or toilet paper; glitter (or nutmeg); talcum powder; a spray bottle filled with water (which could include food colouring, but that is not essential); old magazines; scissors; glue; a blank sheet of paper for each learner group; pens and/or coloured pencils Explain that learners are going to see how germs are spread and make a small collage of where they can be found, and decide on ways to prevent the spread of germs. Let learners form small groups and give each learner a small piece of paper towel or one square of toilet paper with a tiny dab of Vaseline on it. Walk around with a bottle of glitter, or give each group a small bottle. Learners should smear their palms and fingers with a tiny bit of Vaseline. This should be a thin film, just enough for the glitter to stick when they sprinkle a little over their hands, i.e. they should not leave grease marks on everything they touch! Tell learners that the water in your spray bottle is like a cough or a sneeze. Spray a little water in the air a few times, in different parts of the classroom from different angles. Ask learners to put up their hands if they felt drops of water on them. Ask them how the germs from the spray bottle have spread. Then sprinkle a little talcum powder on your hands and blow it off, away from the learners (you don't want learners to breathe the talcum powder in!). Do this a couple of times and ask them to watch how long the powder particles stay in the air and how long it takes to settle (this is best done, if possible, against bright light where learners can see the particles of powder). If the talcum powder represents germs, what does this tell learners about germs? Explain that germs are as tiny and invisible as your water spray and the talcum powder, and they can spread through air and in water droplets. Briefly discuss the places where we can find germs while you hand each learner group a sheet of blank paper, a pile of magazines, a pair of scissors and some glue. Tell the groups to use the magazines to find three to five pictures of places where germs can be found or can hide. They should cut out the pictures to make a collage on their piece of paper, and for each place where germs are found, think of a way to prevent spreading germs. Half way through this activity, tell all the learners to stop. Explain that the glitter represents germs, and ask them where they can see glitter. How did the glitter get there? Let learners summarise the three ways germs spread: through water droplets, through the air, and through touch. They should bear this in mind when they think about instructions for preventing the spread of germs. Let the groups present their collages to the class, explaining how the germs got to each place and giving advice about how to stop the spread of germs.

(I f your learners are interested in how it works, here is a very simple explanation. The substance in the vaccination, called the vaccine, contains a weakened version of the micro-organisms that cause the disease, and stimulate your immune system to produce antibodies that protect you against it.) b) Some examples: polio, measles, tetanus, TB, malaria, flu, typhoid, yellow fever . Learners may come up with others. c) Most learners will probably think it is important, as it stops infectious diseases from spreading so quickly and making ev eryone in the class sick. Some of the diseases vaccines protect you against are very dangerous diseases, which can kill large numbers of people very quickly if the disease is not controlled. Individual Learner's Book page 167All foods contain bacteria. Some bacteria are good for us and some are harmful. Pasteurisation works with heat to destroy the harmful bacteria. The amount of heat used is very important: it must be just enough to destroy the harmful bacteria, but not so hot that the flavour or colour of the milk or other liquid is changed. Group Learner's Book page 168 TB is an infectious disease which usually attacks the lungs. The symptoms of TB include: constant coughing, especially if blood is coughed up; chest pain; difficulty breathing; weight loss; appetite loss; sweating at night; etc. TB germs are spread through the air when people who have TB cough, sneeze, shout, laugh or spit. Small droplets of water carrying the germs spread through the air and people in the area breathe them in and may become infected. To prevent the spread of TB, you should open doors and windows to allow in a lot of fresh air; use a handkerchief or a tissue or toilet paper when you sneeze; cough into your hand or wash your hands after coughing and sneezing; don't spit; and if you have TB, take your drugs and stay at home while you are infectious. TB is treated with drugs which destroy the TB germs. You have to take the drugs for six months and it is extremely important to carry on taking them for the whole six months, even if you feel completely better.

The Pairs need to plan the questions and answers in their role plays before presenting them to the class.162 UNIT 4 MODULE 8Unit 14Unit A breakthrough in surgery Learner's Book pages 170-173 3 hours Curriculum content and concepts Discoveries that made surgery possible: anaesthesia, avoiding infection, blood transfusions, X-rays Christiaan Barnard and the world's first heart transplant operation The invention of artificial hearts Teaching notes You will need: dictionaries; if you can, bring an X-ray to show the class (see Additional resources, below); pamphlets and other information on how to prevent heart disease Ask learners if any of them, or any of their relatives, have ever had to have an operation in a hospital. Let them tell the class about it briefly, then read and discuss the introductory text on page 170 of the Learner's Book with them. Ask a learner to read out each of the discoveries that made surgery possible. After each, make sure that learners understand what it means, e.g. anaesthesia deadens pain; blood transfusions are when you transfer blood from one person to another person who has lost a lot of blood and needs more, etc. Read through the instructions for the Pair Activity on page 170, making sure that everyone understands what to do. Walk around while they are busy to help with any words they find difficult, and to assess informally. Take feedback on the Pair Activity, making sure that learners can explain the benefits, or progress achieved in medical practice, with each new discovery. If you have brought an X-ray to class, show it to the learners and talk about what it shows. Let learners tell their stories about having X-rays, if they have had any done, and ask them to explain why they had an X-ray. Give learners a few minutes to do the Group Activity on page 171 of the Learner's Book. When they are ready, ask them to report back and summarise their ideas in note form, on the board. Find out if any of the learners have heard of Dr Christiaan Barnard, and if so, what they know about him. Ask a few good readers to read the text on page 172, about the first heart transplant. Explain any words you think learners will find difficult and after each paragraph ask a learner to pick out the most important point(s). Talk briefly about heart disease, its causes and how one can prevent it. Make learners aware of your collection of pamphlets and other materials on the subject, then let learners work in pairs to complete the Activity on page 173.163 UNIT 4 MODULE 8 Let learner pairs join up to compare and assess their answers. Walk around to help and assess informally throughout the time they are working. Read the introductory text on page 173 with the learners, then let them read the newspaper article quietly to themselves. When they are ready, ask learners what the difference is between the operation they have just read about, and the operation performed by Dr Christiaan Barnard. Have a class discussion around the questions in the Activity at the bottom of page 173. Encourage all the learners to participate - draw in learners who are quieter than others. Make sure that learners listen to one another with interest and respect, and ask probing questions to help them think through and reason their answers. Answers to activities Pair Learner's Book page 1701846: anaesthesia made it possible to put patients to sleep so that they would not feel any pain during their operation. 1818: first blood transfusion made it possible to prevent patients from dying from loss of blood. 1901: three main blood groups identified, which helped to make blood transfusions safe. 1843 an d 1847: the importance of clean hands for healthcare workers is understood 1860s: surgeons understand the need to kill germs on surfaces and medical instruments and start using antiseptics 1900s: medical staff start wearing clothing to protect themselves and patients from infection 1895: X-rays are discovered so that doctors could see through human flesh G roup Learner's Book page 171 Learners will have their own ideas which you should accept as long as they are plausible. Here are some examples of how X-rays transformed surgery: X-rays would help surgeons to see exactly where they should cut the body to get to the problem they were operating for; it was easier to see if a bone was completely broken or only cracked; surgeons could see exactly where and how a bone was broken; they could see where all the internal organs are (such as the heart, lungs, liver, intestines, etc.) and could work out what a healthy organ looked like and what an unhealthy organ looked like; this helped to diagnose diseases more easily and accurately; they could find things lodged inside the body, such as a bullet and therefore operate very accurately; and so on. Pair Learner's Book page 173 1. Learners should have many ideas of their own, e.g. ' World's first heart transplant in Cape Town'; 'South African heart surgeon 164 UNIT 4 MODULE 8makes medical history'; 'Dr Christiaan Barnard performs successful heart transplant', and so on. 2. a) Foods bad for your heart: red meat, foods fried in a lot of oil, fast foods, full fat dairy products, sw eets, chips, cakes and biscuits, are some examples; learners may come up with others that are equally valid. Lifestyles that are bad: smoking, alcohol abuse, no exercise and putting on weight, too much stress, and so on; accept other reasonable answers. b) Foods good for your heart: fish, fresh fruit and vegetables, whole wheat products, low fat foods; accept other reasonable answers. Lifestyles that are good: regular exercise, regular sleep, manage stress, outdoor activities, and so on; accept other reasonable answers. Class page 173: The only 'wrong' answer to this Activity is a statement or opinion that the learner has not thought through and cannot support when questioned. Informal assessment Pair Activity, page 170: Can learners extract relevant information from text? Can they summarise the progress of medical practices over the last two centuries? Is their spelling correct? Group Activity, page 171: Are learners able to describe and explain how a past event has influenced the present? Did learners work cooperatively, taking turns to speak and listen and ensuring that everyone participated in the discussion? Pair Activity, page 173: 1. Can learners select the key information needed? Does their headline convey something of the excitement of a 'world first' achievement? 2. Are learners able to use a variety of sources to access information? Can they extract information relevant to the questions asked? Are their answers neat and logically organised? Class Activity, page 173: Do learners listen to one another with interest and respect? Can they validate their opinions with good reasons? Are they willing to allow or tolerate opinions that are different to their own? Additional resources If you can, bring an X-ray to show the class when you do Unit 4. Be sensitive about the type of X-ray, however, as some X-rays convey confidential information. An X-ray showing teeth or a broken bone is probably fine; an X-ray showing TB infection may not be.

Let the pairs work together to create a timeline of breakthroughs in medicine from 1846 to 2001. If you want to make this activity a little more challenging, you could extend the timeline to include the discoveries in the previous Unit, i.e. the timeline would extend from 1796 to 2001.166 UNIT 5 MODULE 8Unit 15Unit Holistic and Western healing today Learner's Book pages 174-175 2 hours Curriculum content and concepts Integrating holistic medicine with Western healing practices Researching some modern holistic healing practices Teaching notes You will need: dictionaries, a blank sheet of paper for each learner; coloured pencils and crayons, pamphlets and other materials on holistic healing practices Ask learners to tell you what they can remember about traditional, indigenous healing practices and Western healing practices so far. What are the differences between them? Are there any similarities? Read and discuss the introduction to the Unit on page 174 of the Learner's Book. See if anyone can give you an example of a Western pharmaceutical company (companies that manufacture the medicines we buy from pharmacies or Clicks, or which the clinic gives us, such as headache tablets and vitamin tablets). Make sure learners understand the meaning of 'integrate' (bring together, join, or combine) and see if they can remember the meaning of 'holistic' from Unit 1 (if not, tell them to look it up in the word list on page 179 of their Learner's Book). Let learners do the Activity on page 174 in groups and report back to the class. Ask learners to read the rest of the text on pages 174 and 175 quietly to themselves. Tell learners to find a partner and make up five questions on what they have read. When they are ready, they should join with another pair to ask and answer their questions. Walk around to check learners' understanding of what they have read. Ask a few learner groups to share their questions and answers with the class. Discuss the Activity on page 175 of the Learner's Book with the class to make sure that everyone knows what they need to do. Ask the class how they will go about doing this Activity. Use questions to remind them that they need to plan their work: what information do they want, about the therapy they have chosen? What questions do they need to ask? How will they get the information they need? Remind them that they will need their notebooks to take notes. If they are going to make a poster, how will they illustrate their poster? Remind them, too, that whether they write an essay or make a poster they will need to make a plan for how they will organise their information. Learners should do the research for homework. 167 UNIT 5 MODULE 8 When the learners work on their posters or essays, make sure that you have blank paper, scissors, crayons and a collection of pamphlets for those learners who want to make a poster. Encourage those who are writing an essay to do a rough plan before they start writing. Walk among the learners to assist where necessary and to assess informally. If there is time, let learners share their work with the class. BRIGHT IDEA! Talk by a holistic health practitioner If you can, it would be good to invite one or two holistic health practitioners to visit your school and tell the class about what they do. This would clearly be a useful activity to do before the learners do the Activity on page 175 of the Learner's Book. Prepare learners for the visit beforehand. Tell them to work in pairs to think of questions they would like to ask the person. Take feedback from the learners - you may want to let the class work together to decide on the most important questions they want answered. Let learners write their questions in their notebooks, and point out that it would be useful to take notes during the talk. Ask one of the learners to thank the speaker(s) on behalf of the class, at the end of the talk. You may also like to work with the languages teacher to arrange for the learners to write a letter of thanks to the speakers.! Answers to activities Group Learner's Book page 174: There are no right or wrong answers to this Activity. Individual Learner's Book page 175: See guidelines under Informal assessment. Informal assessment Group Activity, page 17 4: Did the group make notes about the practices of each member in the group? Do their answers show that they understand the difference between traditional and Western healing practices? Individual Activity, page 175: Are learners able to find information from a variety of sources? Have they given accurate information? Have learners used their own words? Is all the information provided relevant? Is there evidence that they have planned their work? Are key ideas grouped together logically, under headings or in paragraphs?

Do you agree with this statement, which is made in the first paragraph of this Unit on page 174 of your Learner's Book?Remedial learners: Write ten sentences giving your views and reasons for them. Extension learners: Write an essay explaining your views.169 REVISION ACTIVITY MODULE 81. a) The speaker on the left is Edward Jenner and the speaker on the right is Alexander Fleming. b) a sangoma: I throw bones and communicate with the spirits; an inyanga: I heal people with muti; Rober t Koch: I discovered the germ that causes TB; Chris Barnard: I performed the world's first heart transplant operation; Louis Pasteur: I invented the process of pasteurisation/proved the germ theory of disease. 2. The following points should be included. A sangoma: identified through a calling bestowed b y the ancestors, not a personal choice; training lasts from six months up to 10 years; includes learning how to throw bones and how to communicate with the spirits; at the end of the training goes through a process of ancestral spirit possession to become a diviner. An inyanga: chooses to become a healer; trains with an experienced inyanga for a few years; learns what plants and animals can be used to make medicines; learns how to collect and mix the medicines, how they should be used and what for. 3. Medicinal plants: you can use the bark, or leaves or flow ers of medicinal plants to make medicines that cure patients. Holisitic healing is healing which looks at a patient's spiritual, emotional, social and physical well-being at the same time. The germ theory of disease is that most diseases are caused by germs that attack a person's body from outside. Integrative medicine integrates Western and holistic healing practices. 4. Western medicine Indigenous medicine Believes illness has only physical causes Believes illness has physical, spiritual and psychological causes Treats symptoms Treats causes and symptoms Uses science and technology for healing Uses medicinal plants and other natural remedies for healing Uses knowledge developed in the West Uses traditional knowledge passed down by generations 5. Some other causes could be that the ancestors are cross with you because you have not shown them respect; or y our illness could be caused by bad feelings between you and your neighbours; it could be caused by something wrong that you did to someone else; or it could be caused by someone who wants to harm you.Module 8 Revision activity Learner's Book pages 176-177 3 hours170 REVISION ACTIVITY MODULE 86. Answers should include any three of the following: William Morton developed anaesthesia which deadened patient's pain during surgery. James Blundell transferred blood from one person to another who was losing too much blood. Karl Landsteiner discovered that there are three main blood groups which led to safer blood transfusions. Ignaz Semmelweis/Oliver Holmes discovered that if healthcare workers washed their hands, disease in hospitals spread less easily. Joseph Lister discovered antiseptics which killed germs in operating theatres. Wilhelm Roentgen discovered X-rays which made surgery more accurate. Christiaan Barnard proved that you can transplant hearts. 7. Society can start integrating holistic and Western healing methods by sho wing equal respect for both. The government can make traditional African medicine part of our healthcare system. Holistic medical treatments and natural remedies could be made available at hospitals and clinics. Community health workers could be trained in holistic healing methods as well as Western methods. Medical aids could allow you to claim for holistic medical treatments. 1 EXTRA RESOURCESIntroductionExtra resources2 EXTRA RESOURCESCity United States of America North-western 34\u00b0N; 118\u00b0W Madrid Spain Northern 40\u00b0N; 3\u00b0W Manila 14\u00b0N; 120\u00b0E Mexico Nairobi Kenya States of America North-western 38\u00b0N; 77\u00b0WModule 1 Unit 1 Class Activity: Question 2: City co-ordinates (Learner's Book page 15)3 EXTRA RESOURCESModule 1 Unit 3 Pair Activity: Greatest features (Learner's Book page 26) No. on mapFeature Continent Grid reference Longest rivers 1 Nile River 6 650 km Africa 2 Amazon River 6 400 km South America 3 Y angtse River 6 300 km Asia Highest moun tains 4 Mt Everest/Sagarmatha 8 848 km Asia 5 K2/ Qogir 8 611 km Asia 6 Kanchenjunga 8 568 km Asia Biggest de serts 7 Antarctica Desert 13 829 430 km2Antarctica 8 Sahara Desert 9 100 000 km2Africa 9 Arctic Desert 2 600 000 km2group of islands Countries with biggest forests10 Russia Asia 11 Brazil South America 12 Canada North America Biggest oceans13 Pacific Ocean 155 557 000 km2Western hemisph. 14 Atlantic Ocean 76 762 000 km2Western hemisph. 15 Indian Ocean 68 556 000 km2Eastern hemisph.

Eat only cooked food, and fruits that have been freshly peeled such as oranges or bananas. Wash your hands before preparing or serving food. Wash your dishes and utensils with soap and water. Wash kitchen surfaces and cutting surfaces well with soap and water. Do not allow play in dirty pools or storm water outlets. Do not go to the toilet in rivers or leave sewage where it can be washed into a river by rain. GOLDEN RULES FOR SAFE FOOD PREPARATIONPrepared by KZN Health Promotion Programme Cook raw food very well Many raw foods, such as fish and vegetables, etc., can easily be contaminated with cholera bacteria. Cooking well will kill the bacteria. Do not eat uncooked foods, unless they can be peeled or shelled. (Contaminate means to make something dirty, unclean or poisonous.)Avoid contact between raw foods and cooked foodsSafely cooked food can become contaminated through even the slightest contact with raw food. Potential risks of illness can also be reintroduced by preparing raw food and then using the same unwashed cutting surface and knife to slice cooked food.Choose food processed for safetyIn an area affected by cholera, foods such as fruits and vegetables may not be safe unless they have been processed through canning, drying, etc.Wash hands oftenWash your hands after using the toilet or latrine. Wash hands thoroughly before you start preparing food. Wash your hands after changing or cleaning the baby. After preparing raw foods, such as fish or vegetables, wash your hands again before you start handling other foods.Keep all kitchen surfaces cleanAny surface used for food preparation must be kept absolutely clean. Cloths used for washing or drying surfaces, dishes and utensils should be changed every day and boiled before use. Separate cloths for cleaning the floor also require daily washing.Use safe waterSafe water is just as important for food preparation as for drinking. Bring water to a rolling boil before using it to prepare meals. Bleach or 8 EXTRA RESOURCESJik may be used instead of boiling to make water safe. Add 1 teaspoon bleach or Jik to 25 litres of water. Before drinking, leave water for at least 2 hours, but preferably overnight.

An Australian company, Coal of Africa Limited (CoAL) has recently been given the go-ahead to begin construction of a coal mine less than 6 km from the Mapungubwe National Park and next to the World Heritage Site. This will have a negative effect on the natural habitat, ecosystems and cultural heritage in and around Mapungubwe, for present and future generations. Several important organisations, including the Endangered Wildlife T rust, the Peace Parks Foundation, the Association of Southern African Professional Archaeologists, the Mapungubwe Action Group, the Wilderness Foundation South Africa, the World Wide Fund for Nature South Africa and BirdLife South Africa, have started a legal battle to prevent any further development of the mine at Mapungubwe. Our country's natural and cultural heritage is threatened, and we must do all we can to defend what is ours. But we need your help to prevent future damage to our precious environment. The mining at Mapungubwe is just the start, with many more mining projects to follow. Anglo Coal has already bought large pieces of land in the area. We need your help to stand up against these mining companies and save our precious environment. You can help by writing a letter to one of the following people, and tell them what you think about a company mining near a World Heritage Site in South Africa: The Regional Manager, Limpopo Department of Mineral ResourcesThe Minister, National Department of Mineral ResourcesThe South African Presidency, Office of the PresidentSource: www.savemapungubwe.org.za 10 EXTRA RESOURCESModule 6 Unit 1 Changes during the Renaissance: Peer assessment sheet Circle the number of the description that best suits your opinion.Did you learn something new?1 A little 2 Enough 3 A lot Is the information interesting and r elevant to the topic? 1 Not really 2 Relevant but 3 Relevant and not interesting interesting Can the learners tell you where the y found their information (i.e. the source)?1 Can't remember 2 Remember, but 3 Can give the not the details exact sources Is the information presented in a logical, well-organised way?1 A bit muddled up 2 It is logical, 3 It's very clear and I can follow it easy to follow Is the poster neat and attractive?1 Not really 2 It is neat, but 3 It is neat and a bit boring very attractive11 EXTRA RESOURCESModule 6 Unit 2 Galileo's 'falling objects' experiment For 2 000 years, people believed the philosopher Aristotle who said that heavier objects fall faster than lighter objects. Aristotle thought that a ball that was 10 times as heavy as another ball would fall 10 times as fast. Neither Aristotle nor any one else had ever tested to see if his idea was correct. In 1589, Galileo proved Aristotle wrong when he dropped a 10 pound ball and a 1 pound ball from the top of the Leaning Tower of Pisa, and a crowd watched them hit the ground at the same time. Galileo's experiment showed that experimentation is necessary to test scientific theories. This is what you do: Move a sturdy chair into the centre of the group. One learner in the group (maybe the tallest person?) climbs up onto the chair. Another learner should stand close by to hold the chair steady. The person on the chair has the two balls of differing weights. Other learners in the group make sure that they can see clearly what happens when the balls are dropped. The learner on the chair drops the two balls from the same height, at the same time. The rest of the group watches very carefully: did one ball hit the ground before the other? Did they hit at the same time? Record the results in the data table below, by ticking off which ball hit the ground first. For any experiment, it is important to do repeated tests to make sure that your results are consistent. Repeat the experiment at least five times, and record your results. Falling Objects Data Table Trial Number Heavy Ball Light Ball Same Time 1 2 3 4 5 What have you discovered? Share the conclusions you reach with the rest of the class. Source: http://www.sciencebuddies.org12 EXTRA RESOURCESModule 6 Unit 2 Galileo's pendulum experiment Galileo Galilei was the first European to study pendulums, and he discovered that their regularity could be used for keeping time. If you pull back a pendulum and then let it go, the time it takes to swing over and then return back to its starting position is one period. This led to the development of the first clocks. In 1656, the Dutch inventor Huygens was the first man to successfully build an accurate clock. The pendulum experiment is also an experiment about gravity. What you will need for the pendulum experiment is: a piece of string, at least 1 metre long; one piece of metal wire to bend into a hook; some nuts from a tool box - they must all be the same weight and must fit onto the hook; a large piece of cardboard to put behind the pendulum, or a large piece of paper that you can stick on the wall behind the pendulum; a pencil; some tape; and a stopwatch. Setting up the pendulum experiment Tape the pencil firmly to the top of a table, leaving about 4 cm hanging over the edge. Make a loop in your string to fit on the end of the pencil, but do not make it too tight fitting. At the other end of your string tie your hook and slide one of the nuts onto the hook. Put your piece of card flat behind the pendulum. Make sure that everything swings freely without sticking. 13 EXTRA RESOURCESExperiment 1: changing the weight In this experiment we are going to find out what effect changing the mass on the end of the string makes. Take your string back about 40-50 cm. Make a mark on your piece of paper to make sure that you let it go from the same place every time. As you let it go, start the stopwatch, and count the number of oscillations in one minute. Repeat the experiment 5 times and calculate an average. Put another weight on the hook. Release the weight from exactly the same place. Calculate the time period as before. Repeat 5 times and average the results. T ry the same procedure after adding another weight. What did you find? Experiment 2: changing the angle Go back to just one weight on the string. You have the results from the first mark in your last experiment so you can use these results again. Now, take the string back only about 20 cm and make a mark as before. Let go and count the number of periods for one minute. Repeat 5 times and then work out an average. T ry exactly the same thing but now let go from 10 cm. What difference does the angle of swing make? Experiment 3: changing the length of the string You already have your results from the first experiment and can use these again. Take the string of the pendulum and cut off about 20 cm. If you are really organised, you can use another length of string from the same roll to make a shorter one. Take back to the same angle and let it fly. Take another 20 cm off the string, replace and try again. What effect does changing the length of the string have on a pendulum?

Read this text about the Mapungubwe Kingdom and answer the questions that follow. Choose the correct answer fr om A, B or C. Mapungubwe was the largest kingdom in southern Africa until the late 1200s. It developed about 1 000 years ago, when most of the people in the surrounding area belonged to farming communities. The site of Mapungubwe is located in the north of South Africa, close to the borders of both Botswana and Zimbabwe. This area is called the 'Shashe-Limpopo Confluence', because the Shashe River flows into the Limpopo River at this point. Mapungubwe lies south of the Limpopo River. The whole area is a UNESCO Heritage Site, which means it is recognised as an important historic place by people worldwide. The area that has been studied by archaeologists is made up of three parts: K2, Mapungubwe Hill and the Southern Terrace. The king, his close family and other rich and important people lived on Mapungubwe Hill. They were also buried there. Their followers stayed at the bottom of the hill and in the surrounding area. There are no original written records of this part of South African history and no known oral traditions. All the information about Mapungubwe comes from objects found there by archaeologists. Historians believe that the knowledge and skills of Mapungubwe influenced the later kingdom of Great Zimbabwe. a) Mapungubwe Kingdom ended in: A the 13th century B the 12th century C 2012 (1) b) Mapungubwe Kingdom started to develop ar ound: A 1200 B 800 C 1020 (1) c) Mapungubwe Kingdom lies in modern-day: A Botswana B South Africa C Zimbabwe (1) d) In the Shashe-Limpopo Confluence area, the: A Limpopo River flows into the Shashe River B Limpopo River ends its flow C Shashe River flows into the Limpopo River (1) e) The Mapungubwe site is made up of these parts: A Mapungubwe Hill, W estern Terrace and K2 B the Mapungubwe Hill C Mapungubwe Hill, Southern Terrace and K2 (1) f) The people of Mapungubwe: A had differences in class and status B were all equal C all lived on the same hill (1)8 FORMAL ASSESSMENT PROGRAMME g) We have learned about Mapungubwe from: A the writings that the citizens of the kingdom left behind B what our ancestors have told us C the objects that the people of the kingdom left behind (1) h) Which statement is true?

One of her crops is spinach. She sells her spinach at R10 per bunch to different people in the community where she lives. Sandra buys spinach from Noma. She has a business that sells and delivers chopped vegetables. Her products are popular with people who work all day and have little time to prepare their own vegetables. Sandra delivers the vegetables to people's homes after work. She gets R18 for every bag of chopped spinach, which holds the contents of one bunch. Lufefe is the owner of a small kiosk from which he sells soups to passers-by. His spinach soup is one of the most popular items on his menu. He adds onions, potatoes and spices to the chopped spinach. The spinach forms the bulk of the soup. Lufefe can make three portions of soup with one bag of chopped spinach. The other ingredients costs him R4 per portion. He sells the soup at R20 per portion. Being so busy, he saves time by buying the spinach from Sandra, already chopped. He is thinking of hiring some help, but it will cost him even more. Lerato also buys spinach from Sandra. She has a small supermarket. She stocks some of Sandra's chopped vegetables in her freezer. She charges R28 for a packet of frozen chopped spinach. 13 FORMAL ASSESSMENT PROGRAMMEa) Complete this diagram that shows the change in value between the spinach that Noma sells and the spinach in Lerato' s shop.

Read these two case studies about banana farmers. On which one of the farms are the practices examples of fair trading? Give r easons for your answers. [3] A Lindiwe works on her small family-run banana farm in rural KwaZulu-Natal. Growing bananas is intense work. Each plant must be cared for by hand. For example, the bananas have to be wrapped in plastic to protect them from birds and insects. The children in the family help do this work. The bananas they gr ow are collected by a local supermarket, who packs the bananas in plastic bags before selling. But sometimes the supermarket does not come. The price Lindiwe and her family earn for their crop varies widely according to world prices. If the supermarket owner can buy bananas at a lower price elsewhere, he does not buy from Lindiwe and her family. BBalene is a banana farmer in a small village on a Caribbean island. She and the other banana farmers in the area have formed a co-operative. This means they make some decisions together. For example, the farmers in the co-operative wrap their bananas themselves before they sell them. By adding this task, they can ask higher prices for their bananas. It also creates jobs for other family members. They also employ local people to help look after the crops and share paying their wages. The members of the co-operative agree on their selling price, and no single farmer can sell bananas outside of the co-operative. The farmers have agreements with a local supermarket as well as a buyer who exports their produce. The local supermarket buys a minimum of bananas every week, and the co-operative guarantees the supermarket a set price. When world prices go up, the exporter adds half of the increase in income to the co-operative. These agreements are made with the co-operative as a whole, who have a stronger voice together than an individual would have had.Noma sells ______ ______ to Sandra customers at R___ _______14 FORMAL ASSESSMENT PROGRAMME9.

Read the case study about one of the world's major cities, London. Answer the questions that follow . London is one of the most important business centres in the world. Many international companies have offices here, with people from across the globe working in the city. One of the reasons for London's success as a financial centre is its many air connections to other city centres in America, Europe and Asia. It helps to make London a convenient halfway meeting point between many world cities. What other factors helped L ondon become so important to the world? Like so many of the world' s major cities, a big river flows through London. This river, the Thames, opens into the sea only a short distance from the city. As a result, the city became a major port. This led to the growth of London as a centre for trade, and for the development of manufacturing industries and other businesses in the region. Job opportunities led to many people migrating from rural areas to London, leading to an increase in population. Today, London is not such a busy port anymore, but big business remained. The Thames is also the very r eason why London was built in the first place. When the Romans reached the area in the 1st century, they needed to cross the Thames, so they built the first ever bridge over it. As the bridge was c onstructed, a settlement formed on the northern side: Londinium. London lies in a gentle river valle y, with hardly any hills. This meant that over time it was easy for urban development to slowly stretch outwards. a) Give two reasons why London is in a good natural location for a settlement.

(3) e) Lufefe gets R60 for three portions of soup. The cost of the ingredients is R24 (R18 for the spinach and R4 for other ingr edients). That means his profit is R36 for three portions, which is R12 per portion of soup. (1) f) C Hiring someone to chop the spinach will cost more than the extra cost of buying it already chopped. (1) [10] 8. The farming practices on Balene's farm are examples of fair trading. Any of these reasons: She works in a co-operative with other farmers. The farmers make decisions together so that everybody accepts the same conditions. They work in ways that benefit the whole community, for example creating jobs. The selling price is fixed, and cannot be undercut by any member. They have negotiating power (because they are a group), so they can get buyers to commit to a minimum monthly spend, for example. When world prices go up, the exporter adds half of the increase in income to the co-operative. [3] 9. Learners choose one topic and write one paragraph.

These ships made it possible for explorers like B artolomeu Dias (1) and Vasco da Gama to travel across the sea(s) / ocean(s) (1) and, for example, go around (1) the tip of southern Africa. They were first built by the Spanish and Portuguese (1). Their design was influenced by Chinese and Arabic sea-trading vessels. However, what made these ships different were their tall masts (1) and large square sails (1). b) Historians believe that the Chinese (1) invented the first compass. (1) They improv ed its design over time and by the 1st century, sailors were already using them to sail in the right direction / course (1) at sea.

They ar e found near the 0\u00b0 latitude in both the northern and southern hemispheres. These regions have high rainfall and the climate is hot and wet. Average annual rainfall is 500 to 1 000 mm, the temperatures average 20 \u00b0C to 30 \u00b0C. The overall temperature range is low. The large amount of sunlight and rain are good growing conditions. Natural vegetation is mostly tall trees growing closely together. Rainforests are areas of high biodiversity - the climate and vegetation provide food and water for many different types of animals and plants. Human activities mostly include cutting down trees and clearing land to make way for farming, roads or mining. Hot deserts Hot deserts are found in North and S outh America, North Africa, the Arab Peninsula and some parts of Asia and Australia. These regions are mostly found along or near the T ropics of Cancer and Capricorn (latitudes 23\u00b0N and 23\u00b0S), in both the northern and southern hemispheres. Hot deserts have very high temperatures and very low rainfall. Average desert temperatures can be over 40 FORMAL ASSESSMENT PROGRAMME30 \u00b0C in July. Temperatures can drop to -30 \u00b0C in January. Average annual rainfall can be less than 250 mm. Because of the harsh climate and sand, there is little vegetation or wildlife in deserts (few species of plants or animals). Plants and animals that live in deserts have adapted to the heat and dryness. People who live in deserts have also adapted to the conditions by living in tents, by living near an oasis, or irrigating for farming. [5]41 FORMAL ASSESSMENT PROGRAMMEMEMORANDUM/RUBRIC: Term 3 History Project (Democracy and citizenship in South Africa} Total marks: 40 As part of formal assessment, learners are required to complete one project in Social Sciences in each grade. In Grade 6, the requirement is for a History project in the third term. The topic is 'Democracy and citizenship in South Africa'. You will find content for the History project on page 154-155 of the Study & Master Social Sciences Learner's Book and pages 143-145 of this Teacher's Guide. The project should be started as early as possible in the term, and learners must be given a reasonable due date to hand in the final work. Learners' progress must be monitored regularly. Allow enough time for assessing the projects, and giving learners feedback. To assess the project, you can allocate marks using the rubric on the next page.42 FORMAL ASSESSMENT PROGRAMME Rubric for Research project: History Term 3 Formal Assessment Task [mark out of 20 \u00d7 2 = total mark out of 40] Learner name: _________________________________ Date: ______________ Level of achievementNot achieved ElementaryModerateAdequateSubstantialMeritoriousOutstanding 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Content 1Identified an appropriate le ader/ good reasons for choice 2Included key even ts and achievements in ices to democrac y/impact on society is clear Research/Use sources 5 Can identify suitable methods o f data collection 6Used a range of sour ces 7Acknowledged sourc es used Record information 8 Collected relevan t information 9Can take not es (use own words, use keywords) Organise information 10 Drew up a rough plan 11Can distinguish betw een main ideas and sub-ideas 12Can provide evidenc e of drafts 13Evaluates o wn work critically Final draft 14 Provides complet e and relevant information 15Organises inf ormation logically 16Has tried to use transition wor ds for smooth flow of information Presentation 17Neat 18Evidence of ef fort to make it interesting Manage task 19 Managed time constructively 20 Kept organised r ecords/notes43 FORMAL ASSESSMENT PROGRAMMEMEMORANDUM: Geography November examination Total marks: 40 Question 1: Climate and vegetation around the world (20 marks) 1. a) tropical (1) b) desert (1) c) coniferous (1) d) biodiversity (1) [4] 2. a) deserts - 3 b) temperate coniferous forests - 2 c) tropical forests - 1 [3] 3. a) It is hard for human beings to settle in desert (1) areas. There is a shor tage (1) of resources such as water, pasture and wood. The hot temperatures and dust storms make it uncomfortable for human life. Yet, there are people who choose to live here, such as the Bedouins of North Africa and the Middle East. The Bedouins are nomads (1) who move from place to place, tending flocks of goats, sheep and camels (1). They often live in tents (1), which they set up and pack up every time they move. In places where they find underground water, they dig wells (1). They eat dates and milk, yoghurt, meat and cheese from animals, and trade wool and hides for other goods. They wear loose gowns that protect them against sun and sand, as well as cloths wrapped around their heads. (1) b) Forestry is an important economic activity in areas with temperate conifer ous (1) forests. The soil in forested areas is poor, so it is no good for farming (1). People who work in the forestry industry use the wood from the trees to make paper, matches, furniture and fabrics. They also produce planks and beams for construction (1). To slow down deforestation (1), natural forests are protected and new forests are planted to supply wood. In plantations (1), foresters plant trees that grow straight and quickly, which means they can be harvested sooner. Felled trees are turned into logs (1), by stripping off branches and leaves. The logs are taken to sawmills, where the logs are made into planks and blocks of wood.

London is fairly flat (not very hilly or mountainous), which made urban development / construction / building easier and quicker. (2) b) business / commerce / trading / financial activity (1) c) Yes. 'One of the reasons for London's success as a financial centr e is its many air connections to other city centres in America, Europe and Asia. (1) d) The Romans had to build a bridge to cross the river, and formed a settlement when they did this.

Childr en have a right to go to school, so their parents do not have the right to take this away from them. (2) B Yes. The right to vote for a political party is a human right. (2) C Yes. It is a woman's right to be paid the same as men who do the same job . (2) D No. The right to speak your mind does not include racist comments and hate speech. (2) [15] Question 2: Medicine through time (20 marks) 2. a) The first ever heart transplant in the world was performed in South Africa in 1967. The surgeon was Chris Barnar d. This operation went well, but the patient died after 18 days. However, the famous surgeon continued his work with great success and saved many lives. (3) b) Dr Edward Jenner is known for using a v accine successfully to prevent smallpox, a dreaded disease that was killing millions of people. In 1796, Jenner took pus/fluid/liquid from a cowpox blister and scratched it into the arm of an eight-year-old boy. The boy got a little sick but when he was exposed to the killer pox, he did not get it. Jenner developed a way to make a person immune to the killer disease. (5) c) X-rays are used to see bones and other things inside the body. When it was developed by pr ofessor Roentgen in 1895, people were amazed by what they saw in them. During the First World War, a scientist called Marie Curie developed this type of photography further, and saved the lives of many wounded soldiers. (3) d) South Africa has many traditional healers who practise African medicine. A sangoma is the most senior in this field. 46 FORMAL ASSESSMENT PROGRAMMEThey use contact with the ancestors to understand patients' health problems. Rejoice Xaba, who is shown here working in modern-day Johannesburg, is trained to do this work. (3) e) Joseph Lister was a British surgeon who made people aware of the danger of septic infections during operations/surgery. H e developed antiseptics to reduce the risk to patients. He did his important work until around 1904. (2) f) Louis Pasteur was a French microbiologist and chemist who lived in the 19th centur y. He worked hard at proving to people that germs like bacteria and viruses existed in food and make people sick. He developed the pasteurisation process, which kills germs in milk.
