No substantive changes were made to the language of the original document. For more information on the United States Ombudsman Association, please visit www.usombudsman.org i PREFATORY NOTE In the Fall of 1994, the board of directors of the United States Omb udsman Association authorized the preparation of an updated model ombudsman act appropriate for state government. There had been renewed interest in the ombudsman concept in a number of states and one, Arizona, was on the verge of enacting an ombudsman bi ll. It was felt that an updated model act would be a useful document for those states interested in establishing an ombudsman office as well as a useful tool to promote the classical ombudsman institution in other states. Ruth Cooperrider, legal counsel in the Iowa ombudsman's office, was asked to chair a committee to draft the model act. She was assisted in this endeavor by Marshall Lux, the Nebraska ombudsman, Mike Hostina, former deputy ombudsman from Alaska, and Yen Lew and Norrie Thompson, the Hawai i ombudsman and first assistant. The accompanying document is the result of our work. While this model act was designed for use at the state government level, it can also be adapted for local government. Those so interested may contact the USOA for assi stance. In drafting the act, the committee decided to use as our basic reference the American Bar Association model which was completed under the leadership of Bernard Frank in 1974. The ABA model itself was based on earlier models, notably the Gellhorn model and the Harvard model. Thus, we are building on the foundations prepared for us by these worthy predecessors. The ABA model was (and is) an excellent document, well thought -out, comprehensive in scope and meticulously annotated by Mr. Frank in his law review article presentation. We left it essentially intact, limiting our revisions to the following areas: 1. Updating and clarifying the language and making it gender neutral; 2. Amending those provisions which over the course of more than two decades of practical experience were found to lead to administrative difficulties or were otherwise problematic; and 3. Adding new provisions to accommodate recent changes in technology and public administration. While the ABA model was our basic reference, we also rev iewed the Gellhorn and Harvard models for additional clarification on certain points. The recently enacted Arizona statute was consulted to help us understand current legislative thinking about the ombudsman institution. Being either current or former om budsman practitioners, we were also able to contribute insights from our experiences with our own respective statutes in Alaska, Hawaii, Iowa and Nebraska. This practical experience gave us an advantage over our predecessors whose frame of reference was m ore theoretical in nature. Working drafts of the bill were presented at the October, 1995 USOA annual conference in Plymouth, Minnesota and the First North American Conference of ombudsman organizations held in May, 1996 in St. Louis, Missouri. After eac h conference, comments on the drafts were solicited from conference delegates and the members of the USOA board. Noted ombudsman scholars were also invited to comment. ii We received in return a number of very useful comments and suggestions from all these sources, including scholars such as Gerald C. Caiden, Bernard Frank and Donald C. Rowat. Our thanks to all of them. In particular, we would be remiss if we did not acknowledge Mr. Frank's careful review of our draft and his detailed commentary. Mr. Fra nk, the chair of the ABA ombudsman committee which had issued the ABA model act in 1974, further stated it was appropriate, timely, and logical for the USOA to review and update the ABA model and issue a new USOA model to supersede the ABA model. We are g rateful for his endorsement. In considering the comments and suggestions we received, we undertook a section -by-section review of the draft model act. While that process took an additional six months, it is our feeling that the model act was significantl y strengthened as a result. Obviously not all suggestions were accepted. In many cases, this was because the suggestion was at variance with the approach taken in another part of the act. Or, the suggestion raised an issue that we had already considered and resolved among ourselves. This final draft represents a document that is acceptable to all members of the committee, where individual differences and preferences were subsumed in a spirit of consensus and where suggestions from other individuals were incorporated as deemed appropriate. While we believe that the model act as here presented is suitable for all states, we recognize that political circumstances in a given state may mean that some variations may be more appropriate. This model act is not cast in stone. Those who may be interested in possible alternatives to any of the provisions of this model act are invited to contact the USOA. Although this is a model act for state governments, the USOA believes the ombudsman institution is applicable at all levels of government and encourages its wider establishment. The state ombudsman office created by this model act is not intended to preempt the establishment of any new local ombudsman office. Any local ombudsman office - whether at the county, municipal, township or other level - whose enabling document meets the standards of independence, fairness, confidentiality, and integrity of the review process which characterize a classical ombudsman, should have statutory immunity similar to that grante d to the state ombudsman under this model act. Such immunity is necessary to enable local ombudsmen to have confidential communications with complainants and witnesses and to make findings without fear of interference or retaliation through legal proceedi ngs. The USOA will assist any state legislature considering the enactment of such local ombudsman immunity. This model act is intended to provide for the establishment of an ombudsman who is able to operate effectively in the context of contemporary stat e government in this, the final years of the twentieth century. The USOA recognizes that future revisions may be necessary to keep this document up -to-date in light of ongoing changes in the law, in standards of government and public administration and in technology. The USOA welcomes suggestions for future consideration. 1 United States Ombudsman Association Model Ombudsman Act for State Governments An Act to establish the office of Ombudsman in . COMMENT: Enactment clause would be in an approp riate form for the state. Section 1. Legislative Purpose It is the intent of the legislature to establish, in addition to other remedies or rights of appeal of any person under state law, an independent, impartial, state office, readily available to the public, responsible to the legislature, empowered to investigate the acts of state [(Alternate) and local] administrative agencies and to recommend appropriate changes toward the goals of safeguarding the rights of persons and of promoting higher standards of competency, efficiency and justice in the administration of state [(Alternate) and local] laws. COMMENT: This section provides a concise description of the characteristics of the office and its goals. If jurisdiction over political subdivisions of the state is included, the phrase \"and local\" should be included. It must be determined whether the inclusion of the phrase \"and local\" will be interpreted as pre -empting state jurisdiction over both state and local agencies and preventing local governmental units from establishing their own Ombudsmen. Section 2. Short Title This Act may be cited as \"The (name of state) Ombudsman Act.\" COMMENT: The title \"Ombudsman\" is distinctive from the more usual official titles such as \"director\" and \"commissioner\" a nd has gained recognition in the United States and other countries. The existing state statutes do not all use the title: Hawaii - \"Ombudsman\"; Nebraska - \"Public Counsel\"; Iowa \"Ombudsman\"; Arizona - \"Ombudsman -Citizens' Aid e.\" But it should be noted the term \"Ombudsman\" is used in these states by the public, the media, and even by the incumbents, who found other titles could be confused with other offices and concepts. The term \"Ombudsman\" should be used only when the legis lation provides for an independent official who receives complaints against government agencies and who, after investigation, may, if the complaints are justified, make recommendations to remedy the complaints. If a term other than \"Ombudsman\" is selected, appropriate changes must be made throughout this Act. 2 Section 3. Definitions As used in this Act, (a) \"Agency\" means any department, organization, board, commission, council, bureau, administrative tribunal, facility, institution or other governmental e ntity of (name of state) , [(Alternate) any person who is providing services to individuals under contract with (name of state) and as a term of that contract is subject to the Ombudsman's jurisdiction], and any official, officer, administrative hearing exa miner, employee or member of (name of state) , whether elected or appointed, acting or purporting to act by reason of connection with (name of state) , except: (1) any judge; (2) the legislature, its members, its committees and its employees; (3) the governor and the go vernor's personal staff; [(4) (Alternate A) any political subdivision of the state;] [(4) (Alternate B) mayors, council members, judges, and any other elected officials of any political subdivision and their personal staff;] (5) any multi -state governmental entity. (b) \"Administrative act\" means any action, decision, adjudication, failure to act, omission, rule or regulation, interpretation, recommendation, policy, practice or procedure of any agency. (c) \"Person\" means any individual, aggregate of individuals, corporati on, partnership, or unincorporated association. (d) \"Record\" means all records, documents, books, papers, files, photographs, microfilms, sound recordings, video recordings, magnetic storage media, computer data and all other materials, regardless of physi cal form or characteristics, created, generated, recorded, received, possessed or controlled by or on behalf of any agency. COMMENT: (a) Rather than specifying by name those agencies under the Ombudsman's jurisdiction, the Act permits jurisdiction over al l state -related governmental operations and personnel (in pursuance of public function) with certain limited exceptions which should be minimized. An alternative clause has been added to provide that the Ombudsman's jurisdiction would include businesses, corporations, persons, etc., under contract to provide services to individuals on behalf of the state. With the increasing popularity of \"privatizing\" government services, policy -makers may feel the need to bring these \"private\" bureaucracies under the Om budsman's jurisdiction, in order to insure that the public receives the same level of protection afforded when the services are provided directly by state agencies. If this alternative is adopted, then it would also be necessary to add to the state's stat utes relating to procurement a provision to require all agencies entering into a contract for the \"privatization\" of governmental services to include in that contract a clause obligating the private service provider to submit to the Ombudsman's jurisdictio n. By making cooperation with the Ombudsman a condition of the contract, the private contractors will understand from the outset their responsibilities to the Ombudsman and will accept that arrangement as a part of the agreement with the state. (a)(1) The exclusion of judges is based upon the existence of the long established system of appellate review of judicial decisions and upon the existence of other mechanisms for the sanctioning and/or the removal of judges who act unethically or who are incapacitat ed. The exclusion is narrow and contemplates that the Ombudsman 3 would have jurisdiction to investigate administrative or ministerial acts by employees of the judicial branch, when those acts are peripheral to the adjudication itself. In many instances, a dministrative errors affecting a particular adjudication would have to be challenged and resolved through the established judicial process, but even in those cases, the Ombudsman could make recommendations for improving administrative procedures that would have a prospective effect. The Ombudsman would not, of course, have the jurisdiction to question, criticize or review the substantive content of any judicial order, decision or opinion. The exclusion of judges would pertain only to judicial officers of the judicial branch of government and would not exclude administrative tribunals or administrative law \"judges\" from the Ombudsman's jurisdiction. (a)(2) The Legislature --an independent policy making body, whose actions are conspicuous and subject to publi c scrutiny, and whose tenure is subject to periodic popular review --is excluded. Committees and staff members who assist in policy formation are, likewise, excluded. Although there may be legislative employees, agencies, bureaus or divisions that provide direct services to the public, those employees and entities are also excluded from the Ombudsman's jurisdiction, because of concerns that the Ombudsman's close relationship with the legislative branch would compromise the independence of the office in dea ling with cases involving those employees, agencies, etc. If it is determined that it is desirable to include these legislative service agencies within the Ombudsman's jurisdiction, then as an alternative the exclusion might read, \"(2) the members and com mittees of the legislature and their immediate staff.\" (a)(3) Elected state officials (e.g., Lt. Governor, Treasurer) who deserve exclusion for the same reasons as (a)(2) above, may be added to (a)(3) but they must be distinguished from other elected state officials who should be included and who are less immediately involved in policy -making and are engaged chiefly in administrative matters indistinguishable from those performed by non -elected officials generally. Thus, appropriate officials to be exclude d may vary from state to state. Alternatively, this exclusion might read, \"(3) elected constitutional officials and their personal staff;\". (a)(4) Alternate A: Where local jurisdiction is not included, (a)(4) should read, \"[(4) any political subdivision of the state;].\" (a)(4) Alternate B: If jurisdiction over a political subdivision is included, Alternate B should be used to give an exclusion parallel to that for state officials: \"[(4) mayors, council members, judges, and other elected officials of poli tical subdivisions and their personal staff;].\" A saving clause for existing municipal Ombudsman offices may be added if necessary and desirable. (a)(5) The specific exclusion of multi -state entities, such as regional transportation and planning authoriti es, and implicit exclusion of federal agencies (including the local offices thereof), are based on practical and constitutional limitations on sovereign power of the state over such agencies. (b) \"Administrative Act\" is broadly defined and includes decisio ns by administrative boards or tribunals or administrative law \"judges\" and rule -making activities. (c) \"Person\" is defined broadly. (d) \"Record\" is broadly defined to make it clear that the Ombudsman is intended to have access to all recorded informatio n possessed or controlled by agencies, regardless of the form or manner of storage of that information. 4 Section 4. Creation of Office The office of Ombudsman is established. Section 5. Nomination and Appointment The (insert name of legislative body) shall elect the Ombudsman by a two -thirds vote of the members of each house present and voting. COMMENT: The Ombudsman is an appointed officer of the legislative branch of government. This arrangement helps to guarantee the independence of the Ombudsman, w ho might be reluctant to criticize the actions of agencies that are responsible to the executive, if he or she were an executive appointee. As part of the legislative branch of government, the Ombudsman is not only providing a direct service to citizens, but is also performing a role in legislative oversight of the agencies under the Ombudsman's jurisdiction. Since the Ombudsman may only make recommendations, and may not compel the executive and judicial agencies to take substantive actions, the Ombudsman 's role is consistent with the concept of separation of powers. Section 6. Qualifications (a) The Ombudsman shall be a person of recognized judgment, objectivity and integrity who is well-equipped to analyze problems of law, administration, and public po licy. (b) No person while serving as Ombudsman: (1) shall be actively involved in political party activities or publicly endorse, solicit funds for or make contributions to political parties or candidates for elective office; (2) shall be a candidate for or hold any other elective or appointive public office; (3) shall engage in any other occupation, business, or profession likely to detract from the full -time performance of his or her duties as Ombudsman or to result in a conflict of interest or an appearance of impr opriety or partiality. COMMENT: The Ombudsman should be a full -time impartial expert in whom the public can have confidence. (a) This subsection gives the core characteristics and qualifications for an Ombudsman and hence provides more guidance than a mer e listing of restrictions on the official. (b) Paragraph (b)(1) seeks to preserve the Ombudsman's impartiality and the appearance of impartiality in the political arena. The Ombudsman retains the right to participate in the political process as a voter a nd to express his or her opinion privately. Paragraph (b)(2) inhibits an Ombudsman from using the office as a political stepping -stone. To further protect the office from politicization, some states (Arizona, Hawaii, and Nebraska) provide that the Ombudsm an shall not have served as a member of the Legislature for one or two years prior to his or her appointment. However, this could prevent the appointment of a highly qualified legislator. 5 Paragraph (b)(3) seeks to assure that the Ombudsman's work is perfo rmed on a full-time basis, and that the Ombudsman remains impartial. Section 7. Term of Office The Ombudsman shall serve for a term of years and until his or her successor is appointed and qualified. He or she may be reappointed for addition al terms. COMMENT: A long term is desirable: to permit the Ombudsman sufficient time to become proficient at his or her duties; to provide a measure of independence from politics; and to provide prestige and security to attract qualified persons to the p osition. An excessively long term (e.g., 15 years) prevents the desired periodic accountability to the Legislature. The term should not be less than five years. The same points that argue for a long term of office for the Ombudsman also support the conc ept that the incumbent should be eligible for reappointment at the end of his or her term. Section 8. Removal and Vacancy (a) The Legislature by a vote of two -thirds of the members of each house present and voting may remove the Ombudsman from office, bu t only for mental or physical incapacity to perform the duties of the office, or other grounds sufficient for removal of a judge from state court. (b) If the position of Ombudsman becomes vacant for any reason, the Deputy Ombudsman shall serve as Acting Om budsman until an Ombudsman has been appointed for a full term. COMMENT: (a) The Ombudsman should be secure in the position, so removal is made difficult and must be for cause. This protects the Ombudsman from groundless attacks or political threats. As an alternative, this subsection might provide that the Ombudsman could be removed from office according to state constitutional provisions for removal of judges or other public officials. (b) In filling vacancies, full term appointment is preferable to rem ainder -of-term appointment as it provides the desirable longer term of office. Section 9. Compensation The Ombudsman shall receive the same salary and benefits as [(Alternate A) a state judge at the general trial court or higher level.] [(Alternate B) a state department head.] [(Alternate C) a legislative agency head.] The salary of the Ombudsman shall not be diminished during the Ombudsman's term of office, unless by general law applying to all salaried officers of the state. COMMENT: The Ombudsman i s a high -level official who should receive a salary that reflects the importance, responsibility and prestige of the office. Also, a high salary is warranted if the Ombudsman is prohibited by law from engaging in any other occupation, business, or profess ion. Three alternative salary proposals are offered for consideration. The first sets the salary at least equal to that of a general trial court judge. The comparison between the two offices is apt in terms of recognizing the Ombudsman's stature as well as reinforcing the 6 concept of the Ombudsman's independence and neutrality. The second ties the Ombudsman's salary to that of the state department heads. This also provides appropriate stature to the office and emphasizes the point that the Ombudsman deal s with department heads as an equal rather than as a lower level official. The third equates the Ombudsman with other legislative agency heads. This approach may be a more familiar frame of reference to legislators and it would help assure consistency within any existing legislative branch salary system. Practically speaking, any of the three alternatives should result in fairly similar salary amounts. Section 10. Organization of Office (a) The Ombudsman shall select, appoint and fix the compensation o f a person as Deputy Ombudsman and may select, appoint and fix the compensation of such other officers and employees as the Ombudsman may deem necessary to discharge the Ombudsman's responsibilities under this Act. Compensation shall be fixed within the amount available by appropriation. All officers and employees shall serve at the Ombudsman's pleasure. (b) The Ombudsman may delegate to staff members any authority, power or duty except this power of delegation and the Ombudsman's duty to make any report under this Act. However, the Ombudsman may authorize the Deputy Ombudsman to act in the Ombudsman's stead in the event of illness, absence, leave or disability, or when, in the Ombudsman's sole discretion, an appearance of impropriety or partiality or a conflict of interest prevents the Ombudsman from discharging his or her duty in a particular matter. (c) The Ombudsman and his or her staff shall be entitled to participate in any employee benefit or retirement plan available to state employees. COMMENT: (a) The sensitive nature of the work and the high degree of delegation to and confidence in staff that will be required dictate that the Ombudsman be free of civil service and political constraints in staff selection and retention. The Ombudsman, however, should refer to civil service salary schedules in setting comparable salaries for staff, and would naturally use state accounting facilities for payment of such [cf., section 11(j)]. The appointment of a Deputy Ombudsman is compulsory while selection of other officials, including an Assistant Ombudsman or Ombudsmen, is optional. (b) This same desire for flexibility should permit a broad delegation of powers. The Ombudsman, however, remains responsible for the organization of the office and for whatever r eports leave the office [section 16] -- unless the Deputy Ombudsman has assumed the Ombudsman's duties under this sub -section or when the office is vacant [section 8(b)]. The Ombudsman has complete discretion with respect to recusal for \"cause\" in order t o avoid procedural smoke screens and because the Ombudsman can be expected to diligently maintain his or her limited authority through appropriate recusal. The Ombudsman has discretion to require, by regulation [section 11(b)] or otherwise, that a delegat ion be in writing or that staff members take an oath of office. Section 11. Powers The Ombudsman's powers and duties include but are not limited to the following: (a) to investigate, on complaint or on the Ombudsman's own initiative, any administrative a ct of an agency, without regard to the finality of the administrative act; 7 (b) to undertake, participate in or cooperate with persons and agencies in such conferences, inquiries, meetings, or studies which might improve the functioning of agencies or lesse n the risks that objectionable administrative acts will occur; (c) to make such inquiries and obtain such assistance and information from any agency or person as the Ombudsman shall require for the discharge of the Ombudsman's duties. Agencies shall not r estrict the Ombudsman's access to agency personnel; (d) notwithstanding any other provision of state law, to have access to and to examine and copy, without payment of a fee, any agency records, including records which are confidential by state law. The O mbudsman shall not disclose confidential records and shall be subject to the same penalties as the legal custodian of the records for any unlawful or unauthorized disclosure; (e) to enter and inspect without prior notice the premises of any agency; (f) to subpoena any person to appear, to give sworn testimony or to produce documentary or other evidence that is reasonably relevant to the matters under investigation; (g) to maintain confidential any matter related to complaints and investigations, including t he identities of the complainants and witnesses, except as the Ombudsman deems necessary to discharge the Ombudsman's duties; (h) to bring suit in (name of court) to enforce the provisions of this Act; (i) to adopt, promulgate, amend and rescind rules and regulations required for the discharge of the Ombudsman's duties, including procedures for receiving and processing complaints, conducting investigations, and reporting findings, conclusions and recommendations. However, the Ombudsman may not levy any fee s for the submission or investigation of complaints; (j) to prepare and administer a budget for the office of the Ombudsman; COMMENT: The general powers and duties of the Ombudsman are enumerated for clarity; however, this section is not an exhaustive lis ting of all the powers and duties delegated to the Ombudsman. Additional provisions related to staffing, delegation of powers and duties, recommendations, and reports are contained in sections 10, 15, and 16. (a) The Ombudsman's investigatory power is lim ited to administrative acts of agencies [section 3(b)]. The Ombudsman may receive and consider complaints from any source. The Ombudsman can initiate an investigation when others are unwilling to come forward with a complaint or when the Ombudsman discov ers a matter warranting investigation. (b) Although most of the Ombudsman's time will be occupied with individual complaints, the Ombudsman can conduct studies of a general nature to improve agency efficiency or service to the public, either independently or jointly with other governmental bodies or non -governmental research enterprises. (c) The Ombudsman has broad access to any type of information from an agency or person, and an agency may not restrict agency personnel from assisting or providing informat ion to the Ombudsman. There is no requirement to conduct formal evidentiary hearings of an adversary nature, although the Ombudsman can take statements from persons under oath. If testimony is taken, it should be perceived purely as an investigatory proce eding, and the procedure need not comport with what is normally required in a formal adjudication hearing. 8 (d) The Ombudsman can examine and copy or obtain a copy of any agency record, including records which are confidential under state law, without the payment of any fee. However, the Ombudsman and the Ombudsman's staff are obligated to maintain the confidentiality of any confidential records provided by an agency to the same extent as the legal custodian of the records. (e) The Ombudsman has the power to inspect any agency without notice, as advance notice might negate the value of such a visit. Information gathered on site visits may provide subjects for investigation on the Ombudsman's own motion. (f) The Ombudsman can compel any person to provide test imonial, documentary, or other evidence through issuance of a subpoena. Implicitly, the Ombudsman and his or her staff are empowered to administer oaths to such witnesses. Protections and privileges for witnesses, regardless of whether or not they have been subpoenaed, are provided in section 18. If a person refuses to comply with the subpoena, the Ombudsman can seek enforcement under section 11(h). (g) To facilitate the gathering of information, the Ombudsman has discretion to keep confidential any comp laint or investigative information. The Ombudsman may disclose such information as the Ombudsman deems necessary or appropriate in carrying out the Ombudsman's duties. (h) The Ombudsman may bring suit regarding the exercise of his or her powers, including actions: for a declaratory judgment to obtain jurisdiction [under sections 3(a) and 11(a)]; to enter and inspect agencies [section 11(e)]; to show cause for not appearing after being subpoenaed [section 11(f)]; and to enforce confidentiality provisions [s ections 13(d) and 13(e)]. (i) The Ombudsman is given broad regulatory discretion to determine the procedures for carrying out the office's functions. The Ombudsman may through rules or regulations specify the means by which complaints may be submitted (wh ich may include fax or electronic mail) and require for good reason that certain types of complaints be in writing. To insure accessibility (and avoid discrimination against the poor), a fee may not be imposed for the Ombudsman's services. (j) A provision for budgetary powers may be necessary in some states and useful in others, to insure that the Ombudsman's budget is independent of outside (agency) administration. Section 12. Investigation of Complaints (a) The Ombudsman shall conduct a suitable invest igation of a complaint that is an appropriate subject for investigation. An appropriate subject for investigation by the Ombudsman includes any administrative act which the Ombudsman believes might be: (1) Contrary to law or regulation; (2) Based on mistaken fact s or irrelevant considerations; (3) Unsupported by an adequate statement of reasons; (4) Performed in an inefficient manner; (5) Unreasonable, unfair, or otherwise objectionable, even though in accordance with law; or 9 (6) Otherwise erroneous. (b) The Ombudsman in the O mbudsman's discretion may decide not to investigate because: (1) The complainant could reasonably be expected to use another remedy or channel; (2) The complaint is trivial, frivolous, vexatious, or not made in good faith; (3) The complaint has been too long delayed to justify present examination; (4) The complainant is not personally aggrieved by the subject matter of the complaint; (5) Resources are insufficient for adequate investigation; or (6) Other complaints are more worthy of attention. (c) The Ombudsman's declining to in vestigate a complaint shall not bar the Ombudsman from proceeding on his or her own initiative to investigate an administrative act whether or not included in the complaint. COMMENT: (a) The Ombudsman has a duty to investigate the complaints described in subsection (a), although he or she may decline to investigate for the reasons given in subsection (b). The enumerated complaints indicate the kinds of administrative acts that generate complaints to the Ombudsman's office. As shown by paragraph (a)(6), w hich is a catchall, and subsection (c), the statute is intended as a guide to and not a limitation on the complaints which the Ombudsman can investigate. (b) The Ombudsman may choose to investigate a complaint even though the statute permits him or her to refuse. For instance, under paragraph (b)(1), if the Ombudsman believes that recourse to an administrative or legal remedy would be futile or overly burdensome to the complainant, the Ombudsman may investigate the complaint. Similarly, the Ombudsman may decide to investigate a complaint of public concern even though the complainant was not personally aggrieved. (c) Complaints which are inappropriate for investigation may nevertheless reveal administrative acts which the Ombudsman may decide to investigate on his or her own initiative [section 11(a)]. Section 13. Rights of Complainant --Communication With Complainant (a) After the Ombudsman has decided whether or not to investigate a complaint, the Ombudsman shall suitably inform the complainant. (b) The O mbudsman shall, if requested by the complainant, suitably report the status of his or her investigation to the complainant. (c) After investigation of a complaint, the Ombudsman shall suitably inform the complainant of his or her conclusion or recommendati on and, if appropriate, any action taken or to be taken by the agency involved. (d) A letter to the Ombudsman from a person held in custody --including by detention, incarceration and hospitalization --by an agency shall be forwarded immediately, unopened, t o the Ombudsman. A letter from the Ombudsman to such person shall be immediately delivered, unopened, to the person. Telephone and personal contacts between the Ombudsman and a person in custody shall not be prohibited or monitored. 10 COMMENT: Subsection s (a), (b) and (c) give the Ombudsman a general duty to inform the complainant of the status of his complaint. The experience and judgment of the Ombudsman will determine the suitable response to be made. Section 14. Rights of Agency Before formally iss uing a conclusion or recommendation that is significantly critical or adverse to an agency, the Ombudsman shall have consulted with that agency and permitted the agency reasonable opportunity to reply. If the Ombudsman makes a conclusion or recommendation available to the agency to facilitate a reply, the conclusion or recommendation is confidential and may not be disclosed to the public by the agency unless the Ombudsman releases it. COMMENT: This section protects agencies, their officers and employees b y requiring consultation and giving them reasonable time to reply to significant criticism before the Ombudsman issues critical findings. The Ombudsman has the discretion to make all or part of his or her findings available to facilitate a reply. Because the Ombudsman may modify findings, which may include removal of confidential information and incorporation of the agency's response [section 15(b)], after reviewing the agency's reply, disclosure of findings not released by the Ombudsman is a violation of law, which may be dealt with under existing records confidentiality provisions. Notice of the Ombudsman's decision to investigate is not required because such formalities: are inconsistent with the role of the Ombudsman as an alternative to procedure -bound remedies and the limited resources of the office; are largely ceremonial in that the Ombudsman will inevitably contact the agency during an investigation; and are not required by due process given the absence of Ombudsman power to enforce recommendatio ns and the fact that an opportunity to be heard is required before publication. If an advance notice provision is nonetheless desired, it should provide for: informal or preliminary inquiries without notice, since experience shows that the vast majority of complaints are handled expeditiously and informally; withholding notice when notice would hinder investigation; and flexibility of form to avoid legalistic procedural wrangling, e.g. \"If after making preliminary inquiries the Ombudsman decides to investi gate, the Ombudsman shall suitably inform the agency involved unless the Ombudsman reasonably believes that advance notice will unduly hinder the investigation or make it ineffectual. The Ombudsman may inform the agency verbally or in writing.\" Section 1 5. Procedure after Investigation (a) If, after investigation, the Ombudsman is of the opinion that an agency should: (1) consider the matter further, (2) modify or cancel an act, (3) alter a regulation, practice or ruling, (4) explain more fully the act in question, (5) rectify an omission, or (6) take any other action, 11 the Ombudsman shall state any conclusions, recommendations and reasons therefore to the agency. If the Ombudsman so requests, the agency shall, within the time specified, inform the Ombudsman about the action tak en on recommendations or the reasons for not complying with them. (b) After a reasonable period of time has elapsed, the Ombudsman may issue his or her conclusions or recommendations to the legislature, the governor, a grand jury, the public, or any other appropriate authority. The Ombudsman shall include any brief statement the agency may provide if an opportunity to reply is required by this Act. (c) If the Ombudsman believes that an action has been dictated by laws whose results are unfair or otherwise objectionable, and could be revised by legislative action, the Ombudsman shall notify the (insert name of legislative body) and the agency of desirable statutory change. (d) If the Ombudsman believes that any agency official or employee has acted in a mann er warranting criminal or disciplinary proceedings, the Ombudsman shall refer the matter to the appropriate authorities without notice to that person. COMMENT: (a) Though the Ombudsman will rarely have reason to make a recommendation if there is no error in what the agency has done or neglected to do, the Ombudsman should remain free to suggest improvements in method or policy even when the existing practice may be legally permissible. Thus the Ombudsman may facilitate one agency's learning about and taki ng advantage of the experience of another. This subsection contemplates no entry of judgment, as it were, but simply the expression of opinion by the Ombudsman. The Ombudsman is not a superior official, in a position of command, and cannot compel a chang e in an administrative act. The Ombudsman's recommendation may, however, induce an agency to exercise whatever power it may possess to right what the Ombudsman points out as a past mistake. (b) If the Ombudsman is required to provide an opportunity to rep ly under section 14 and a reply is forthcoming, the Ombudsman must include it when issuing findings. Rather than permitting the Ombudsman to summarize replies, replies are limited to a \"brief\" statement which shall be printed unedited; regulations as to w hat is \"brief\" might be promulgated under section 11(i). (c) There may be instances where an agency acted in accordance with existing law, but the law itself produces unjust results. The Ombudsman has the duty to bring these situations to the attention of the legislature and appropriate agency officials; if appropriate, the Ombudsman may comment on or recommend changes in legislation. (d) The Ombudsman's duty to report wrongdoing pertains to miscreant officials. This subsection makes it clear that the Omb udsman may report allegations of wrongdoing without having to first notify the person involved (who may otherwise flee the state or destroy pertinent evidence if tipped off prematurely). This avoids any ambiguity which may arise if this subsection is read in conjunction with section 14. If the person has testified before the Ombudsman, such testimony would bear the same privileges as testimony in court [section 18]. 12 Section 16. Reports The Ombudsman may from time to time and shall annually report on his or her activities to the Governor, to the Legislature, or any of its committees, to the public and, in the Ombudsman's discretion, to agencies. COMMENT: The Ombudsman's sole means of correcting flawed practices when agencies refuse to do so is to publish criticism and recommendations. The annual report, whose release date would be set by the Ombudsman [section 11(i)], is mandatory. Special [section 15(b)] or general interim reports are discretionary with the Ombudsman. Section 17. Ombudsman's Immunitie s (a) The substantive content of any finding, conclusion, recommendation, or report of the Ombudsman or member of the Ombudsman's staff shall not be reviewable in any court. (b) The Ombudsman and the Ombudsman's staff have the same immunities from civil an d criminal liabilities as a judge of this state. (c) The Ombudsman and the Ombudsman's staff shall not be compelled to testify or produce evidence in any judicial or administrative proceeding with respect to any matter involving the exercise of their offic ial duties except as may be necessary to enforce this Act . COMMENT: (a) & (b) As a public watchdog, the Ombudsman should be able to state his or her position freely and candidly without fear of pressure or reprisal. The judicial immunities afforded the O mbudsman are intended to protect against harassment when the Ombudsman deals with controversial issues or makes an unpopular decision. While the Ombudsman's findings are presented only after due consideration, no claim of infallibility is made and the Omb udsman's findings, conclusions and recommendations are always subject to criticism by government officials as well as members of the public. Since the Ombudsman has no enforcement power and any findings and recommendations are only advisory in nature, the courts should have no authority to order that an expression of opinion be changed. (c) Certain dealings that the Ombudsman has with complainants and witnesses may be confidential in nature. This subsection is meant to protect these confidential relations hips so as to encourage complainants to avail themselves of the Ombudsman's services and witnesses to cooperate with the Ombudsman, where they may be otherwise reluctant to do so. Section 18. Witnesses' Privileges Any person who provides information unde r this Act may be accompanied and advised by counsel of his or her choice and shall be paid the same fees and travel allowances and accorded the same privileges and immunities as witnesses whose attendance has been required in the (name of court) . However , a representative of an agency providing information under this Act during business hours shall not be entitled to receive such fees and allowances. 13 COMMENT: Although investigations conducted by the Ombudsman are not contested cases or adjudications of rights or interests, and although nearly all testimony will be private and confidential, witnesses who testify (whether or not by subpoena) are given judicial privileges and immunities. Witness fees and travel allowances are also required for persons who provide information to the Ombudsman under the Act. A provision that a representative of an agency during business hours shall not be entitled to such fees and allowances is included to avoid possible double payment of public servants during working hours . Section 19. Obstruction Any person who willfully obstructs or hinders the proper and lawful exercise of the Ombudsman's powers, or willfully misleads or attempts to mislead the Ombudsman in the Ombudsman's inquiries, shall be guilty of a (specify the l evel of offense) . COMMENT: It must be determined in each state whether necessity exists for indicating the court in which proceedings are to be brought and upon whose initiative. Since fines for offenses vary from state to state and may be subject to per iodic changes, it is preferable to specify the offense rather than a set amount of fine for a violation. Section 20. Reprisals Prohibited (a) No person who files a complaint or participates in any investigation or proceeding pursuant to this chapter shal l be subject to any penalties, sanctions or restrictions in connection with his or her employment or be denied any right, privilege, or benefit because of such action. (b) A person who alleges a violation of this part may bring a civil action for appropria te injunctive relief, actual damages, and punitive damages. Punitive damages shall not exceed $10,000. COMMENT: This section provides protection to complainants and witnesses from reprisals at their place of employment or the deprivation of other rights or privileges because of their participation in Ombudsman investigations. Section 21. Relation to Other Laws The provisions of this Act are in addition to and do not in any manner limit or affect any other provisions of law under which any remedy or righ t of appeal is provided for any person, or any procedure is provided for the inquiry into or investigation of any matter. The powers conferred on the Ombudsman may be exercised notwithstanding any provision of law to the effect that any administrative act ion shall be final or unappealable. COMMENT: This section clearly sets forth that the Ombudsman office is a supplemental remedy and is in addition to other remedies or rights of appeal --a principle also covered in section 1 with respect to legislative pur pose. This section also establishes the principle that the Ombudsman powers are not inhibited by statutory enactments providing that any administrative action shall be final or unappealable. 14 Section 22. Appropriation There is appropriated out of the gen eral revenues of the state the sum of $_______, or so much thereof as may be necessary for fiscal year _____, to the office of the Ombudsman to carry out the purposes of this Act. COMMENT: Before an Ombudsman statute can be implemented, funding needs to b e made available to pay for the expense of the office. This section provides the mechanism to do this. This section should be included where required by the fiscal regulations or practice of the state. If inclusion of such section is not necessary, it c an be omitted. Section 23. Effective Date This Act shall take effect upon its approval. COMMENT: This is standard enactment language. The Act actually becomes effective only after appropriation has been made and an Ombudsman has taken office. Sectio n 24. Severability The provisions of this Act are declared severable, and if any provision thereof is held to be invalid for any reason, the validity of the remainder of the Act shall not be affected. COMMENT: The inclusion of this section is optional. It is not in any of the existing state Ombudsman statutes. The need for a severability clause is unclear, but it may be helpful to assuage any legal concerns that may be raised when the bill is being voted on in the legislature. 15 REFERENCES Our proposed model ombudsman act is based primarily on the American Bar Association Model Ombudsman Statute for State Governments.

The Governor signed the bill with a partial veto and it became effective on July 22, 2007. Laws of 2007, ch. 364, codified at Chapter 2.72 RCW. The OPG contract s with public and private entities and/or individuals to provide public guardianship services to persons age eighteen or older whose income does not exceed 200 percent of the federal poverty level determined annually by the United St ates Department of Health and Human Services, or who are receiving long -term care services through the Washington State Department of Social and Health Services and there is no one else willing and able to serve. Initial implementation of public guardians hip services was required to occur on a pilot basis in a minimum of two geographical areas including one urban and one rural area. RCW 2.72.030(1)(d). The OPG selected Clallam, Grays Harbor, Okanogan, Pierce and Spokane C ounties as sites to pilot public guardianship services. In response to documented significant need for public guardianship services, in January 2009 the OPG started a pilot program in King County . Incapacitated individuals are served based on the following priorities: Indigent/Homeless . At significant risk of harm from abuse, exploitation, abandonment, neglect, or self-neglect. Imminent danger of loss or significant reduction in public services that are necessary to live successfully in the most integrated and least restrictive environment that is appropriate for a specific individual. Anticipating significant budget cuts , in June 2009 the OPG placed a moratorium on accepting new cases pending a decision on the 2009- 2011 budget. The moratorium will remain in effect until additional funding is obtained. 2 Purpose of the Report The Legislature directed the OPG to \"report to the legislature on how services other than guardianship servic es, and in particular services that might reduce the need for guardianship services, might be provided under contract with the office by December 1, 2009. The services to be considered should include, but not be limited to, services provided under powers of attorney given by the individuals in need of the services.\" This report fulfills said directive.

Her attending physician, Dr. Bryant, has determined that Patsy lacks decisional capacity to give informe d consent. Patsy has no family, has not executed an advance directive, and has no legally auth orized surrogate. Who will consent to the medical procedure? Marie , a 58- year-old female, is concerned that she might die alone in a nursing home. She very much wants to live out her life in her home. Where can Marie obtain information, support and assistance on substitute decision -making that will allow her to plan for her future? Jim , a 45 -year-old male with a developmental disability, recently lost his mother, his last relative and longtime financial manager. Although Jim lives alone, works and makes all his personal decisions, he never learned to manage money. Who will manage Jim's money now? Answering these questions is the focus of the recommendations presented in this report. The recommendations included are based on the central premise t hat decisional capacity is not global . In the past, theories of competency and capacity were based on the principle of all or nothing. An individual was believed to either be competent or incompetent, to have capacity or to lack capacity. Thus the legal construct of guardianship was developed to accommodate this all or nothing theory. Advances in medicine, knowledge of brain function and functional ability has dispelled the all or nothing theory. Capacity is now believed to be specific to functional ar eas and not global. It is also believed to fluctuate, here today gone tomorrow; to be situational and contextual, occurring as a result of environmental influences or other triggering events, and can potentially be enhanced with education, training, rehabilitation , treatment (mental health and medical), therapy (occupati onal and physical), services (home and social), and assistive devices or accommodation. The change in capacity theory provides an opportunity to modify how guardianship and alternative programs and services are structured and delivered. The recommendations focus on people and their needs , and emphasize that when possible any alternatives us ed should be reflective of the individual's personal communication mechanisms and assist them to outline their needs and wishes. This ultimately leads to greater inclusion as valued members of both community and society. Name has been changed for confidentiality Id. Id. 5 The report responds to the legi slative directive to report to the L egislature on how services other than guardianship services and, in particular , services that might reduce the need for guardianship services, might be provided under contract with the Office of Public Guardianship ( OPG) . Six recommendations are presented: 1) Expansion of State Aging and Disability Resource Centers . 2) Provide protective payee/money management services to individuals who lack t he ability to manage their finances . 3) Adopt the Uniform Power of Attorney Act (UPOAA) . 4) Provide power of attorney services to individuals who l ack the ability to manage their finances. 5) Create statutory surrogate decision- making committees, which empower committees of trained volunteers to evaluate the need for a surrogate decision- maker and when necessary consent to a course of treatment. 6) Develop a statewide guardianship monitoring program that includes visits and field investigations , financial audits , and concise reports to be fil ed in the official court record. 6 Abbreviations AAA Area Agency on Aging ADRC Aging and Disability Resource Centers AoA Administration on Aging AOC Administrative Office of the Courts CIDL Center for Independent Living CPG Certified Professional Guardian DD Developmental Disability DMM Daily Money Management DPOA Durable Power of Attorney OPG Office of Public Guardianship POA Power of Attorney SDMC Surrogate Decision -Making Committee SSI Supplemental Security Income TBI Traumatic Brain Injury VA Veteran's Administration 7 Definitions Activities of Daily Living Things adults normally do in daily living including any daily activity perform ed for self-care ( feeding , bathing, dressing and grooming ), work, homemaking , and leisure. Advance Health Care Directives A health care advance directive combines the health care power of attorney and living will document into one document. Agent A person granted authority to act for a principal unde r a power of attorney, whether nomin ated an agent, attorney -in-fact, or otherwise. The t erm includes an original agent, co -agent , successor agent, and a person to which an agent's authority is delegated. Best Interest A decision -making standard where the surrogate makes a decision for a person with a mental incapacity based on an objective determination as what will provide the best benefit for the person and promote their welfare. Capacity An ability to comprehend both the nature and consequences of one's acts. An ability to adequately provide for nutrition, health, housing, physical saf ety, and manage property and financial affairs . Daily Money Management (DMM) Daily money management services help people with their financial affairs, including check depositing and writing, checkbook balancing, bill paying, insurance claim preparation, t ax preparation and counseling, public benefit applications and counseling. DMM is voluntary. A person must be capable of asking for or accepting services. Durable Power of Attorney (DPOA) A power -of-attorney with a statement that the agent's authority will remain in effect even if the principal becomes mentally incapacitated. Without a durable provision, a power of attorney (POA) terminates when the principal becomes mentally incapacitated. POAs are often used to cover health care and end-of-life decision s. An agent's authority ends if the principal revokes the DPOA or dies. Guardian A guardian is a person appointed by a court to manage the affairs of a person who is incapacitated. A guardian may be ap pointed to manage the financial affairs of a person at significant risk of harm because of a \"demonstrated inability to adequately manage property or financial affairs.\" A guardian may be appointed to make health care and other non-financial decisions for a person at significant risk of harm because of a \"demonstrated inability to adequately provide for nutrition, health, housing or physical safety.\" (The quoted language is from the Washington State law, Revised Code of Washington 11.88.010 .) 8 Health Care Power of Attorney A health care power of attorney enables a person to name an agent or proxy to make health care decisions if he or she becomes unable to do so. It may address any type of health care decision, and may include guidance to the agent about the type and extent of health care desired. Health Care Surrogate or Family Consent Laws Health care surrogate or family consent laws provide legal authority for certain groups of persons (e.g., spouses, children, parents) to make health care decisions for an adult who cannot make or communicate such decisions due to disability, illness or injury, and who has not authorized someone else to do so. Health Care Any care, service , or procedure provided by a health care provider. Health Care Facility A hospital, clinic, nursing home, laboratory, office , or similar place where a health care provider provides health care to client s. Heath Care Provider A person who is licensed, certified, registered or otherwise authorized by the law of Washington State to provide health care in the ordinary course of business or practice of a profession. Power of Attorney A writing where a mentally capable person, (the \"principal\" ) grants authority to another person (the \" agent \") to act in place of the principal . An ag ent's authority ends if the principal revokes that authority , becomes mentally incapacitated, or if the principal dies. Principal An individual who grants authority to an agent in a power of attorney. Representative Payee A representative payee is appointed by a government agency to receive, manage, and spend government benefits for a beneficiary. A beneficiary may request a representative payee, but usually the agency requires one when a beneficiary is incapable of managing benefits. The representative payee's authority is limited to the government funds for which he or she is the payee. 9 Substitute Judgment Standard A decision -making standard where the surrogate decision -maker makes a decision for a person with a mental incapacity based on what the person would have wanted if the person were able to make the decision his or herself. The surrogate may consider information such as the person's past statements, beliefs, values, and prior life style. Supplement al Security Income Supplemental Secur ity Income (SSI) is a federal income supplement program funded by general tax revenues (not Social Security taxes): It is designed to help aged, blind, and disabled people who have little or no income; and It provides cash to meet basic needs for food, clothing and shelter. Surrogate A person or entity that functions as a substitute for another. Traumatic Brain Injury Involves a blow or jolt to the head or a penetrating injury that disrupts brain function. Traumatic brain injury ( TBI) may cause death and short - and long -term injuries. It affects thinking, language, learning, emotions, behavior, memory , and general independent body functions.1 1 US Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Traumatic Brain Injury Prevention, http://www.cdc.gov/ncipc/tbi/TBI.htm 10 Introduction According to the New England Journal of Medicine2 there are four levels of capacity3 : (1) the ability to communicate a choice; (2) the ability to understand information; (3) the ability to appreciate one's personal situation; and (4) the ability to weigh information in a rationally defensible way. If one were to ask oneself what should happen to me if I lost one of the above capacities, it is doubtful loss of autonomy and appointment of a guardian would be chosen. Unfortunately, under the current statutory framework, that may be the most probable result . This report recommends a comprehensive statutory framework emphasizing assistance in decision -making where appropriate, rather than assuming the need for substituted decision- making, thus preserving self -determination to the greatest extent possible. Today in Washington State the number of persons with diminished capacity in one or more of the areas above is growing as illustrated by the following demographic trends : Washington's popul ation will age rapidly over the next two decades. The state's elderly population, age 65 and older, is expected to grow from 662,000 (or 11.2 percent of the population) in 2000, to 1.66 million (or 19.7 percent of the population) by 2030. 4 At the same time , forms of dementia are becoming more prevalent. Today, approximately 110, 000 persons in Washington State have been diagnosed with Alzhei mer's disease, the most common type of dementia.5 That number is estimated to increase to 130,000 by 2020 and 150,000 by 2025.6 National estimates indicate that about 2 percent of the US population l ive with long-term or lifelong traumatic brain injury (TBI) -related disability and need help 2 Applebaum, PS and Grisso, T., Assessing Patients' Capacities to Consent to Treatment , New England Journal of Medicine, Vol. 319:1635, Dec. 1988. 3 The capacity to consent to treatment and or to make a decision should not be confused with legal capacity determinations made in the guardianship context. While the capacity to consent and to make decisions should inform capacity determination in guardianship they are not equivalent. RCW 11.88.010 (1) (a) & (b) state \" a person may be deemed incapacitated as to person when the superior court determines the individual has a significant risk of personal harm based upon a demonstrated inability to adequately provide for nutrition, health, housing, or physical safety\" and \"a person may be deemed incapacitated as to the person's estate when the superior court determines the individual is at significant risk of financial harm based upon a demonstrated inability to adequately manage property or financial affairs.\" 4 Office of Financial Management, The 2009 Long- Term Economic and Labor Force Forecast for Washington, June 2009, Ch. 2 Pg 14. http://www.ofm.wa.gov/economy/longterm/2009/lt09ch2.pdf 5 Alzheimer's Association, 2009 Alzheimer's Disease Fact and Figures , pg 25, to be published in Alzheimer's & Dementia, Volume 5, Iss ue 3. 6 Id. 11 to perform activities of daily living .7 If these national estimates hold true in Washington State, there are a total of 123,750 residents living with TBI -related disabilities.8 Every year there are approximately 5,500 TBI hospitalizations. This translates to 280 more persons annually living with a lifelong TBI related disabil ity. The Washington State Health Department reports that from 2003 to 2005, the prevalence of disabilities in Was hington increased for those ages 16 and over.9 In 2005 , there were 783,000 Washingtonians age 16 and over with a disability.10 The Washington State Developmental Disabilities (DD) Council reports that there are 106,000 persons in Washington State with a developmental disability.11 Similar to the general population, the DD population is living longer, experiencing a 247 percent increase in life expectancy from 19 years in the 1930s to 66 years in 1993.12 The DD Council further reports that 67 percent of all individuals with developmental disabilities live with family , and in at least one- quarter of these households the primary caregiver is 60 years or older.13 Over the next twenty years , large numbers of primary caregiver s will be unable to care for the family member who has a developmental disability.14 The Joint Legisla tive Audit and Review Committee reported in its 2006 review of the need for a specialized regional jail facility that at least 16 percent of persons in jails are mentally ill.15 This population is believed to be at increased risk for suicide; present increased problems to custody staff; and are likely to reoffend.16 7 Thurman, D.

These individuals may need assistance making decisions for a number of reasons, including: they were born with a learning disability, have a mental illness, developed dementia or a similar condition such as Alzheimer's, suffered a stroke or other trauma, or some other degenerative condition. The lack of a statutory framework r esults in an \"all or nothing \" approach to decision - making assist ance . Generally, individuals who have diminished decision- making abilities are deemed to lack the ability to make any decisions. The assistance most often available is appointment of a full guardian. Often full guardianship unnecessarily restricts and inhibits the autonomy and self -determination of individuals who need special assistance with specific issues. The risk s resulting from the absence of a comprehensive statutory framework are: a) Increasing caseloads within the jurisdiction of probate, civil and criminal courts, including disputes over eligibility for, and the scope of governmental services, mental health matters, abuse, and exploitation. b) Increasing numbers of vulnerable adults at risk for exploitation. c) Increasing financial and other abuse that is difficult to detect because there is no individual or institution willing and able to intercede, resulting in harm to human dignity. d) Incarceration becomes a replacement for treatment resulting from the inability of individuals to access needed services without the assistance of an appropriate surrogate. e) Inconsistent, and sometimes poor decision making by well -meaning, but unqualified surrogates. f) Subjecting individuals to over -treatme nt or under -treatment, or treatment that does not reflect their values , choices and preferences , or best address their well - being. 14 g) Healthcare decisions may be drawn out as no one is willing to assume the risk associated with making a decision. There is anecdotal evidence that without client consent, facilities may be reluctant to request treatment , and clinicians may be reluctant to provide treatment until the need for treatment becomes an emergency. h) Placement in settings more restrictive than individual need demands. i) Repeated emergency hospitalizations resulting from the inability of individuals to obtain preventive healthcare without the assistance of an appropriate surrogate. These risks have both a human and a financial cost that may be minimized, and in some cases eliminated , by adoption of the following proposed solutions. 15 Future: Reducing the Need for Guardianships Addressing the need for decision- making assistance requires solutions that include an opportunity to plan for a time when capacity may diminish as well as solutions for individuals whose capacity has already diminished. TASH, an international advocacy association of people with disabilities, families , and other advocates , urges developing alternatives to guardianship through \"the development and promotion of the use of accommodations and supports individual's need to make choices and decisions, to have their preferenc es honored and recognized, and to have their rights to self -determination protected.\" The solutions provided herein seek to honor this principle. RECOMMENDATION ONE: Expansion of State Aging and Disability Resource Centers. Include the provision of information, support, counseling, assistance , and education related to substitute decision- making to individuals, nominated guardians, court -appointed guardians (lay and professional), other substitute decision -makers (representative payees, agents under P owers of Attorney for Health Care and Powers of Attorney for Finances, family members) and professionals who work with these constituents in the expansion of State Aging and Disability Resource Centers (ADRC). Overview of Aging and Disability Resource Centers ( ADRC) Expansion The Aging and Disability Resource Center Program (ADRC) is a collaboration effort of the U.S. Administration on Aging (AoA) and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to implement in all states Aging and Disability Resource Centers : (A) To serve as visible and trusted sources of information on the full range of long-term care options that are available in the community, including both institutional and home and community -based care; (B) To provide personalized and consumer -friendly assistance to empower people to make informed decisions about their care options; (C) T o provide coordinated and streamlined access to all publicly supported long - term care options so that consumers can obtain t he care they need through a single intake assessment and eligibility determination process; (D) To help people to plan ahead for their future long -term care needs; and 16 (E) To assist, in coordination with the State Health Insurance Assistance Program, Medi care beneficiaries in understanding and accessing the Prescription Drug Coverage and prevention health benefits available under the Medicare Modernization Act. The U.S. Administration on Aging ( AoA) has established the g oal of using ADRCs to empower cons umers to make informed decisions about their long -term service and support options. ADRCs are created to provide information and access \"programs\" or \"systems\" that involve networks of state and community organizations that work together in a coordinated manner to provide consumers with a single point of entry to all long-term services and supports. One model which AoA strongly endorses and supports is a \" one stop shops \" or \"no wrong door\" approach where ADRCs serve as single entry points to address many of the frustration consumers and their families experience when trying to find needed information, services, and supports. It is critical in creating an ADRC system that there be close partnering between Area Agency on Aging (AAA) , Centers for Independent Living (CIDL) , Public Guardianship programs and other community organizations such as local chapters of the Arc of Washington, advocates for the rights of citizens with disabilities, supported living , and employment providers and s elf-advocacy organizations. Need to Partner to Expand ADRCs Understanding the options available to the elderly and persons with disabilities affords these individuals and their families the opportunity to make choices and decisions which honor and recognize their right of self -determination. Educating the elderly and people with disabilities, family , and service providers about the benefits, alternatives, supports and accommodations available allow s them to continue living in the community and helps to mitigate the need for guardianship. Absent that knowledge, decisions may not occur in a timely fashion and may result in decision- making by persons unfamiliar with the preferences of the individual. Due to the complicated nature of benefits, services and su bstitute decision- making , there is a unique need for communication at a level that is understandable to each consumer requesting information. Communication at this level is best performed by individuals with a significant level of subject matter expertise. Because no one entity or organization is thoroughly versed in all relevant topics, partnering is required to provide the best quality service. Method To assist ADRCs provide \"one- stop shop ping\" sources of information, one- on-one counseling, and st reamlined access to programs services and information, the Washington State Administrative Office of the Courts (AOC) and OPG would provide information, support, counseling, assistance, and education related to substitute decision- making to: 17 Individuals ; Nominated guardians ; Court-appointed guardians (lay and professional) ; Other substitute decision- makers (representative payees, agents under powers of a ttorney for h ealth care and f inances, family members) ; and Professionals who work with these constituents . Assistance would be provided via a service model that incorporates advanced care planning into regular family and community conversations. AOC/OPG would seamlessly integrate its core competencies, subject -matter expertise in substitute decision- making, into the services provided by an existing elder network , thirteen (13) Area Agencies on Aging (AAA) and a disability network (six (6) Centers for Independent Living [CIDL ]). Integration will include leveraging the communication resources and tools (help lines, websites, listservs, newsletters and other publications, events, present ations and other face- to-face interaction) of the thirteen AAAs and six C IDLs to provide information, support, cou nseling, assistance , and education to target populations. The OPG will serve as a clearinghouse, a central agency for the collection, classification, and distribution of information on substitute decision- making. Informa tion will be shared through help l ines, Web sites, listservs, newsletter s, training s, and publications. Advantages The impact of the project will be multifaceted: (1) Appropriate advanced care planning will enable individuals to access the services and protections needed to effectively and efficiently continue living in their homes and communities even if their decision- making capacity diminishes; (2) The availability of a support service will improve the quality of decisions made by individuals with disabilities and the surrogates of persons with disabilities; (3) Will in crease awareness and knowledge of substitute decision- making, including decision- making standards such as best interest and substituted judgment and the standards and procedures governing guardianship, representative payeeship, advance directives, family consent , and powers of attorney ; (4) Will increase the number of individuals, families and profes sionals gaining knowledge about the effect and use of Powers of Attorney , and the requirements for executing valid documents ; Court-appointed guardians and agents will learn more about their legal obligations and restrictions; (5) Will potentially reduce the need for court intervention on behalf of persons believed to have diminished capacity, including petitions for guardianship; and (6) Will p otentially reduce exposure to abuse, neglect , and exploitation. 18 Disadvantage ADRCs are new entities, largely unknown to the communities they are to serve. A great deal of community education is needed before ADRCs are considered effective sources of information. RECOMMENDATION TWO: Provide protective payee/money management services to individuals who lack the ability to manage their finances. Overview and Need A representative payee (RP) or sometimes called protective payee is an individual or organization that receives Social Security and/or Supplemental Security Income (SSI) payments , veteran's , civil service , or Black Lung benefits for someone who cannot manage or direct the management of his or her finances in a manner that ensures that basic living needs are met. 17 These agenci es generally look for fam ily or friends to serve in a protective payee capacity, but w hen friends and family are not able to serve as payee, qualified organizations are sought to be a protecti ve payee. Most protective payee organizations are paid by fees assessed to clients' bene fits. Social Security has set payment on client benefits at no more than $37 per client or, up to ten percent of clients' benefit under $370. The Veteran's Administration (VA) has set at payment at a maximum of $66 per client benefit. Method The public guardianship administrator (OPG) would be authorized to establish and administer a protective payee p rogram as follows: The office shall contract with public or private entities or individuals to provide protective payee services to persons age eighteen or older . The office shall adopt eligibility criteria to enable it to serve individuals with the greatest need . The office shall adopt minimum standards of practice for entities providing protective payee services. An overarching standard will be respect for the client's autonomy. RPs will be expected to communicate with each client; to understand and respect his or her values, preferences and choices; and to explain all decisions made on the client's behalf. The office shall monitor and oversee the use of state funding . 17 Daniel Luchins, David Roberts & Patricia Hanrahan, Provision of Protective Payee Status , pg 2, Illinois Department of Human Services' Office of Alcoholism and Substance Abuse. 19 The office shall collect uniform and consistent basic data elements regarding service deliver y. This data shall be made available to the Legislature and Supreme Court in a format that is not identifiable by individual (s) to protect confidentiality. The office shall adopt a process for receipt and consideration of and response to complaints against the office and contracted providers of protective payee services. The process shall include investigation in cases in which investigation appears warranted in the judgment of the administrator. The office shall develop standardized forms and reporting instruments. The office shall ident ify training needs for protective payees it contracts with . The office may offer trai ning to entities providing protective payee services. The office shall establish a system for monitoring the performance of protective payees it contracts with. The office may conduct further monitoring, including in- office visits as the administrator deems appropriate. For monitoring purposes, office staff shall have access to any information relating to a protective payee client t hat is available to the protective payee. Advantages A representative payee (RP) can be helpful for individuals who, because of disability, are unable to meet their basic living needs. In the case of mental illness, RP provision can improve community tenure by ensuring that rent is paid consistently and on time. It can also ensure that clients have enough money to provide food for themselves from one check to the next, and can help clients learn to budget their money so they can save for per sonal items and larger purchases. But representative payees \u2014especially agency -based programs \u2014are in a position to provide more for their clients than assistance in meeting basic living needs. Some effective programs bundle RP provision with other services, such as skills training in the areas of budgeting, bill paying, shopping, and working with banks. RP programs can also provide advocacy by assisting clients to secure entitlements and by helping to negotiate with debtors, landlords , and other fi nancial institutions. The benefits of RP beyond meeting basic living needs may include: Reduced inpatient and emergency hospitalization. Increased treatment compliance. Improved quality of life. Reduced victimization related to money. Increased use of community services. 20 Decreased substance abuse. Reduced physical health symptomatology. The protective payee arrangement is simple, inexpensive, and a potential least restrictive alternative to guardianship for people with little income. Appointment is limited to the handling of specific government funds and does not affect other areas of decision- making. The RP process does not require a formal, judicial finding of incompetency/incapacity like a guardianship. The beneficiary may also request a change in payee. In addition , services provided under contract with OPG will adhere to established standards and OPG will provide oversight. Disadvantages The protective payee still has great control over the beneficiary's affairs without being subject to judicial oversight. A payee also may be appointed against the beneficiary's will. Payment amounts set by government benefit providers may not represent sufficient comp ensation, thus additional funding may be needed. Potential funding sources are addressed on page 36. Funding SSA and VA need the help of qualified organizations to serve as representative payees and are continually recrui ting social service agencies, institutions, and state or local government agencies to provide fee- for service representative payees. RECOMMENDATION THRE E: Adopt the Uniform Power of Attorney Act (UPOAA) Overview of the Uniform Power of Attorney Act (2006) A study conducted by the Uniform Law Commission (ULC) (formerly the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws [ NCCUSL ]) revealed differing approaches to powers of attorney provisions in state statutes. 18 State provisions addressing multipl e agents, the authority of later -appointed guardians, the impact of dissolutions or annulments of the principal's marriage to the agent, activation of contingent powers, the authority to make gifts, and standards for agent conduct and liability were increa singly non- uniform. The Joint Editorial Board for the Uniform Trust and Estate Acts (JEB) conducted a national survey of probate and elder law sections of all state bar associations, the fellows of the American College of Trust and Estate Counsel, the leadership of the 18 Unif. Power of Atty Act. Preface (2006) http://www.law.upenn.edu/bll/archives/ulc/dpoaa/2008_final.htm 21 American Bar Association (ABA) Section of Real Property, Probate and Trust Law and the National Academy of Elder Law Attorneys and to special interest list servs of the ABA Commission on Law and Aging to determine the rules that should guide development of a uniform power of attorney statute. Seventy percent of survey responders agreed that a power of attorney statute should: (1) Provide for confirmation that contingent powers are activated; (2) Revoke a spouse- agent's authority upon the dissolution or annulment of the marriage to the principal; (3) Include a portability provision; (4) Require gift making authority to be expressly stated in the grant of authority; (5) Provide a default standard for fiduciary duties; (6) Permit the principal to alter the default fiduciary standard; (7) Require notice by an agent when the agent is no longer willing or able to act; (8) Include safeguards against abuse by the agent; (9) Include remedies and sanctions for abuse by the agent; (10) Protect the reliance of other persons on a power of attorney; and (11) Include remedies and sanctions for refusal of other persons to honor a power of attorney. The ULC drafted the Act, incorporating the knowledge gained from its study and surv ey. Need While the power of attorney (POA) can be a simple and effective means of handling surrogate decision- making, it is considered by many to be a \"license to steal\" because it provides an easy means to commit abuse. The 2008 AARP report , Power of Attorney Abuse: What States Can Do About It , lists the following characteristi cs of powers of attorney which make it easy for an agent to commit financial abuse: (1) \"Broad decision- making authority .\" The agent must have broad decision- making authority for t he POA to be an effective tool. (2) \"Lack of monitoring.\" There is no third party monitoring , thus it is difficult to detect abuse of authority. 22 (3) \"Unclear standard for agent conduct.\" POA laws do not provide specific legal standards about the duty of the agent to the principal. The AARP reports that evidence of POA abuse can be found in anecdotal reports from professionals, requests for help from victims of abuse, family members of victims , and media stories. 19 The report concluded that POA abuse occurs ev erywhere: it may or may not be considered a crime and may be perpetrated by family and nonfamily members. 20 The report further states that due to the lack of national data collection on the incidence and prevalence of POA abuse, it is difficult to definit ively pinpoint the extent of the problem.21 Adult Protective Services reports and surveys from lawyers and other professionals are used to gather information about the problem.22 Analysis of 2003 APS data indicates that 20.8 percent of reports made to state APS agencies about persons age 60 and older concerns financial exploitation.23 National surveys of lawyers and other professionals and anecdotal evidence provide more clarity about the extent of the problem. 24 Referencing an article by Linda S. Whitt en, UPOAA reporter, the article lists the following three categories of abuse: (1) \"Transactions exceeding the intended scope of the agent's authority,\" such as gift making without explicit authority; (2) \"Transactions conducted for self -dealing purposes,\" for example when the agent purchases items for his or herself with the principal's resources; (3) \"Transactions conducted in contravention of the principal's expectations,\" when the agent makes gifts that significantly diminish the principal's estate plan. Provis ions of the Uniform Power of Attorney Act (UPOAA) that Protect Against Abuse According to the AARP's analysis, the UPOAA has 21 provisions that protect individuals and preserve autonomy. Several of these provisions have already been adopted in whole or i n part in Washington State . Section 108, which defines the relationship between an agent and a fiduciary subsequently appointed by a court (such as a guardian of the estate). RCW 11.94.010 (1) is substantially similar. 19 Lori Stiegel and Ellen VanCleave Klem.

Section 111(a), which allows the appointment of co -agent s and provides guidance on how and whether co-agent s are to act jointly or independently. Section 111(b), which addresses the termination of a spouse- agent's authority if the marriage ends, recognizing that a spouse -agent may have conflicting interests in such circumstances. Section 111(d), which addresses the responsibility of co -agent s or successor agents to protect the principal if another agent breaches or is about to breach his or her fiduciary duty. Section 113, which clarifies when an individual who has been name d as an agent has accepted the resp onsibility of acting as agent. Sections 114 (a), (b), and (h), which clarify the mandatory and default duties of the agent and indicate under what circumstances an agent must disclose information about his or her actions to a third party (including courts , other fiduciaries, or APS or other protective agencies). RCW 11.94.050 is substantially similar to Section 114 (h). Section 115, which addresses the circumstances under which a principal's attempt to exonerate an agent fro m liability will not be bindin g. Sections 116 (a) and (b), which indicate who may petition a court to construe a POA or review an agent's conduct and restrict a court from dismissing such a petition at the principal's request if the principal lacks capacity to revoke the agent's authority or the POA. RCW 11.94.090 and 100 are substantially similar to Section 116(a). Section 117, which governs liability for agents who violate the POA law. RCW 11.94.120 Section 118, which provides guidance to an agent who resigns his or her role to protect an incapacitated principal from being left without a decision maker. Section 119, which addresses third- party acceptance of and reliance upon a POA. Sections 120(b)/(c) and (c)/(d), which list circumstances under which a third party may legitimate ly refuse to accept a POA and provide sanctions for unlawful refusals. RCW 11.94.040 is substantially similar to Section 120 (b) and equivalent to Sections 120(c) and (d). 24 Section 123, which states that the remedies under the POA law are not exclusive and do not limit the rights or remedies provided under other state laws. Section 201 and 301, which set forth the powers that an agent cannot exercise unless the POA expressly authorizes the agent to do so because of the harm that can occur to the principal's property and estate plan if the powers are misused. RCW11.94.050 is substantially similar to Section 201(a). The UPOAA also includes a statutory form that spells out in plain language what the POA does, and a form listing the duties of the agent that can be signed by the agent to acknowledge his/her acceptance of responsibilities. The UPOAA has many features that do not relate to protecting vulnerable adults or preserving their autonomy. Implementation of this alternative would therefore involve other stakeholders (e.g., real estate and elder law attorneys, banks , and other businesses). Advantages Reduces the risks associated with establishing a POA such as: The agent may not understand his/her duties . The agent may steal or self -deal. It may be difficult or impossible to hold the agent accountable. Banks and others may not honor valid exercise of POA authority . Banks and others may not respond effect ively to financial exploitation. Disadvantages Increases the complexity in developi ng a POA, which may reduce its availability to those without access to legal assistance. Does not address the authority to make health care decisions. In Washington, the Power of Attorney statute (RCW 11.94) covers both financial and health care issues. 25 RECOMMENDATION FOUR: Provide power of attorney services to individuals who lack the ability to manage their finances. Overview and Need Adoption of the Uniform Power of Attorney Act would institute tougher safeguards to protect individual s from power of attorney abuse and increase the usefulness of DPOAs . POAs and DPOAs only apply in situations where an individual (the \" principal\") has the mental capacity to sign one and voluntarily chooses to do so. POAs and DPOAs allow the principal to appoint an agent to work at the pleasure and direction of the principal. If the principal's direction or wishes cannot be determined, the agent should ac t in accordance with the \"best interests\" of the principal. Because powers of attorney are voluntary, a principal who has the mental capacity to do so may revoke the power at will. The usefulness of POA s and DPOAs is dependent on the availability of a tr usted and reliable person who agrees to act for the principal. P rincipals must choose agents carefully and there should be reasonable oversight. In the absence of trusted individuals, family , and friends reputable entities are needed to provide services. The OPG could fulfill that role. Method The public guardianship administrator (OPG) would be authorized to establish and administer a power of attorney program as follows: The office shall contract with public or private entities or individuals to provide power of attorney services to persons age eighteen or older. The office shall adopt eligibility criteria to enable it to serve individuals with the greatest need. The office shall adopt minimum standards of practice for entities providing power of attorney services. The office shall monitor and oversee the use of state funding. The office shall collect uniform and consistent basic data elements regarding service delivery. This data shall be made available to the L egislature and Supreme Court in a format that is not identifiable by individual to protect confidentiality. The office shall adopt a process for receipt and consideration of and response to complaints against the office and contracted providers of power of attorney services. The process shall include investigation in cases in which investigation appears warranted in the judgment of the administrator. 26 The office shall develop standardized forms and reporting instruments. The office shall identify training needs for agents it contracts with. The office may offer training to entities providing power of attorney services. The office shall establish a system for monitoring the performance of power of attorneys it contracts with. The office may conduct further monitoring, inc luding in-office visits, as the administrator deems appropriate. For monitoring purposes, office staff shall have access to any information relating to a power of attorney client that is available to the agent. Advantages Services are available to anyone who cannot identify a reliable, trustworthy person to appoint. Provides an opportunity for the individual to plan and select an agent based on his or her preferences. Entities acting as agent are monitored and regulated. Doesn't require court intervention. May reduce the need for guardianship. Disadvantages The grantor must have capacity to establish a power of attorney. Funding will be needed. Potential funding sources are addressed on page 36. RECOMMENDATION FIVE : Create statutory surrogate decision -making committees, which empower committees of trained volunteers to evaluate the need for a surrogate decision -maker, and when necessary consent to a course of treatment. Overview of Surrogate Decision -Making Committee s (SDMC) A Surrogate Decis ion-Making Committee (SDMC) is comprised of regional panel s of volunteers from the community who convene to review specific cases where the client is not able to consent to a routine medical procedure. The S DMC evaluates the need for a surrogate decision- maker and if so then evaluates and recommends a course of treatment for the client . Considering the order of priority of decision- makers defined by 27 Washington S tate statute ,25 the SDMC would be last on the list, interceding only when no other legally authorized decision maker is available. Ideally the SDMC would help to avoid a medical emergency by managing health care decisions in a proactive manner. Need for Surrogate Decision -Making Committees (SDMC ) SDMCs are needed to respond to a population that a 2002- 2003 study by the American Bar Association Commission on Law and Aging26 described as client individuals who: Lack decisional capacity to give informed consent to the recommended treatment; Have not executed an advance directive; and Have no legally authorized surrogate, and no family or friends willing and able to assist in the decision- making process. Today, in the absence of an emergency , obtaining treatment for members of this population requires appointment of a guardian. Guardianship c an be costly, time- consuming and procedural ly difficult. With respect to low income individuals, public guardianship services are only available in six counties . Guardianship may also unnecessarily restrict the individual's ability to make decisions in other areas of his or her life, as guardianship appointments are usually plenary and wrongly assume that an inability to consent to a recommended treatment equates to an inability to make other decisions. The size of the population described above in Washi ngton State is not known, but experts estimate that 3 -to-4 percent of the total nursing home populations are members of this group . 27 In 2008 the Office of Financial Management reports a nursing home population of 11,044 which translates to 332- to-441 pers ons in nursing homes who are members of the population described in the ABA study .28 The Department of Housing reports that 2,729 of Washington State's 11,929 homeless populations are dealing with mental health issues.29 These persons are also likely members of the population described above. Washington State Developmental Disabilities Council reports that over the next twenty years approximately one- quarter or approximately 18,000 family members caring for 25 RCW 7.70.065 Informed consent - Persons authorized to provide for patients who are not competent - Priority. 26 Naomi Karp and Erica Wood, Incapacitated and Alone, July 2003 27 Id. 28 Washington State Office of Financial Management, State -Supported Nursing Home Caseload, http://www.ofm.wa.gov/trends/tables/fig406.asp 29www.commerce. wa.gov/DesktopModules/CTEDPublications/CTEDPublicationsView.aspx?tabID=0& 28 persons with developmental disabilities wi ll reach age 80 and be unable to appropriately care for the person with a developmental disability.30 If appropriate decisions around surrogate decision- making have not been addressed, these individuals will become members of the population described in the ABA study. Surrogate Decision- Making Committee (S DMC ) Jurisdiction SDMCs would have a narrow focus . Jurisdiction would include major medical, surgical , or diagnostic treatment where a general anesthetic is used, including necessary dental care or treatm ent which involves significant risk. Jurisdiction would exclude t he administration of medications including antipsychotic medications, mental health and psychiatric treatment, electroconvulsive therapy, withdrawal of life sustaining treatment, sterilization, and termination of pregnancy. Eligible Agency Participants Hospitals Psychiatric Centers Developmental Centers Long -term Care F acilities Home and Community Based Waiver Clients Surrogate Decision- Making Committee (S DMC ) Make Up Each panel will be comprised of four disinterested third party volunteers. Panels will include one health care professional , one attorney admitted to practice law in Washington State, one lay person, and one advocate with a recognized expertise in the care and treatment of persons with disabilities. The advocate will assist the person believed to lack capacity to consent , to express his or her wishes , and improve their ability to understand the proposed treatment and make healthcare decisions. Profession als (health care, legal , and residential) involved with each case, and any individual with a conflict of interest will be excluded from panel participation. Surrogate Decision- Making Committee (SDMC ) Proceeding An informal , user-friendly process requiring client attendance should be developed. The steps of a process currently used in New York are as follows: 31 1. Declarant files declaration on behalf of a client believed to need major medical treatment and believed to lack cap acity to consent to, or refuse treatment. The declaration: 30 http://www.ddc.wa.gov/Publications/090211_AgingTFReport.pdf 31 Commission on Quality of Care and Advocacy for Persons with Disabilities http://www.cqc.state.ny.us/sdmcforms/sdmc.htm 29 i. Shall be signed by the declarant . ii. States the client does not have a parent, spouse, adult child, committee of the person, conservator or legal guardian, or if he or she does have one, that person is willing to allow th e panel to step in as surrogates. iii. State reasons showing lack of capacity including factual and professional bases . iv. Provide a description of the major medical treatment proposed and the declarant's opinion as to the client 's best interests . 2. When the committee receives the declaration, it will send a copy to any family members , and the chairperson of the committee will assign the declaration to a panel. 3. Prior to the panel hearing, panel members shall review the declaration and decide if they need additional information. i. They may request information from a physician, health care facility or health care professional. ii. They may request an independent assessment of the client . iii. They may consult with other persons who might have further information about the client 's values, preferences and choices. 4. When the hearing is conducted, the client is present, as well as any person the client requests to be present. 5. If practical, panel members interview and observe the client before making their decision. 6. The panel determines based on clear and convincing evidence if the client is in need of surrogate decision- making. Three of the four member panel must agree that the client needs surrogate decision- making; otherwise, the cl ient will be found not to have this need. 7. If the panel determines the client needs surrogate decision- making, if possible it must determine the values, preferences and choices of the individual and how those relate to the major medical treatment being co nsidered. If the panel is unable to determine the values, preferences , and choices of the individual , it should determine what is in the best interest of the client based on a fair preponderance of the evidence. 8. If the panel decides to consent to the treatment, the consent is considered a legally valid consent as if the client, he or she, had capacity and consented. 9. At any time, a parent, child, spouse, committee of person, conservator , or legal guardian may object to the panel and proceedings will be ended. 30 10. A copy of the determination with a description of the right to appeal is given to the client. The average time from SDMC's receipt of a cas e to a hearing and decision is fourteen (14) days, and expedited hearings are also available. Advantages Allows for informal and thus more responsive decision- making for individuals who need some form of treatment. Provides a neutral party to review and make decisions. Can provide another layer to facilitate decision- making. Panel may want more information from experts or recommend \"sub- process \" such as guardian ad litem . Pane ls help guide everyone through the process in a more thoughtful and rational way. Cost effective when compared to guardi anship proceedings. Disadvantages Does not address the need for routine decision- making on behalf of persons with diminished capacity. Does not address the need for a thorough assessment to determine capacity, nor provide a referral procedure for consideration of guardianship. Recruitment and training of volunteers is essential. Potential funding resources are addressed on page 36. RECOMMENDATION SIX : Develop a statewide guardianship monitoring program that includes visits/field investigations, finan cial audits and concise reports to be filed in the official court record. Overview of Guardianship Monitoring Programs Guardianship monitoring has been included as a means to reduce the need for guardianship because an individual's circumstances and condition may change over time. Monitoring is a form of assessment , and assessment of the need for guardianship is an ongoing process meant to ensure that a person is placed under guardianship only when necessary , and only to the extent required by his or her decisional incapacities. The purpose of a guardianship monitoring program is to collect and evaluate information about the well -being and property of persons who have been adjudicated incapacitated by the courts. The information collected is to be used to protect and preserve the interests of the incapacitated person. A guardianship monitoring program provides the opportunity to look beyond required paper reports to onsite visits. 31 Onsite visits afford an opportunity for impartial third parties to observe incapacitated persons in their homes and provide information that could answer the following questions: Are there signs of abuse or neglect? Is the incapacitated person receiving adequate food and shelter ? Does the medical, psychiatric, and physical treatment received by the incapacitated person appear to be appropriate? Is the care being provided to the incapacitated person consistent with the plan? Is the incapacitated person receiving any rehabilit ation services and/or therapies? Are t he preferences of the incapacitated person being considered? Does the placement of the incapacitated person appear to be appropriate? Need for Guardianship Monitoring Guardianship matters, unlike other cases , may remain open for years or even decades, particularly in cases involving individuals with developmental disabilities or mental disorders. Once incapacity has been determined, there are usually no \"adversaries\" to alert the court to potential problems. The absence of adversaries encumbers the court to be proactive to discover and respond to disputes and issues. The need to be proactive is even more important when the incapacitated person has no family or friends involved in his or her life. The role of a guardian is highly complex, involving legal, medical, social, financial an d psychological dimensions, while many guardians are lay persons, inexperienced with the guardian process and unfamiliar with professional ethics and standards. The eyes and ears of a guardianship monitor can assist the court in detecting and correcting minor issues before they become big problems. These minor corrections can help to preserve and protect the autonomy of incapacitated persons as well as conserve judicial resources. Method To efficiently and effectively report on the well -being of the incapacitated person and to protect his or her assets , the court should use court or volunteer investigators to monitor all cases or a random select ion of cases, post -appointment , and develop a financial auditing program with various levels of review, depending on the needs and circumstances of the incapacitated person. 32 A good guardianship monitoring program requires cooperative effort between the County Clerk , court administration, and a dedicated monitoring team compris ed of a minimum of four positions: program coordinator, records researcher, court visitor , and court auditor. The duties of each are briefly described below: The program coordinator is the designated manager. The coordinator recruits and selects qual ified individuals for other positions, is responsible for training, scheduling, case tracking , and reporting. Records researchers review g uardianship records and verify the information contained in the records. Verifying involves investigating via phone calls and written communicatio n to obtain correct information -- last known address of incapacitated person, updated annual reports, etc. Court visitors visit guardians and incapacitate d persons and report on the care of the incapacitated person. Court auditors review annual returns and related financial records, note problems and concerns , and follow -up as needed. Advantages Aids in assuring proper care and protection for incapacitated adults. Acts as a deterrent to abuse, neglect , and exploitation. Improves the court's image and inspires public confidence. Provides a means to tracking guardianship and gauging the effect of court orders. Assists guardians in meeting their duties to incapacitated persons . Ensures the accuracy and completeness of guardianship reports. Disadvantages Need for volunteers, training , and funding. Potential funding sources are addressed on page 36. Potential liability issues associated with volunteers . 33 Potential Sources of Funding Due to the curr ent economic crisis locally and national ly, securing funding during a time of severe budget cutting will be difficult. Thus, creative funding sources must be aggressively considered and pursued. Unfortunately, time constraints hindered a review of funding sources by OPG's ad hoc Advisory Committee . The following potential sources are presented by OPG as a basis for further discussion. Harness Escheat Funds Escheat is the reversion of property to t he state when a person dies without a Will or any known heirs . Washington State Department of Revenue reports the collection of $1,700,000 between 2004 and 2008 in escheat funds. The Department includes escheats collected when a decedent died without a Will and there were no known heirs or a decedent died listing specific heirs in their Will and those heirs were not located. Developing a plan to harness escheat funds should be explored. Establish a Charitable Foundation and a Pooled Trust A charitable foundation is a distinct legal body, authorized to collect funds from donors and other bodies , receive gifts, grants , and bequests of assets or property solely for the benefit of a trust. A charitable foundation could establish and manage a pooled trust with separate trust accounts established for the benefit of any individual who is disabled . Any funds that remain in a beneficiary's account at his or her death would be retained by the trust or used to reimburse the state. Establishing a pooled trust should be explored. Secure Funding via the Older American s Act Congress passed the Older Americans Act (OAA) in 1965, in response to concern by policymakers about a lack of community social services for older persons. The legislation established authority for grants to s tates for community planning and social services, research and development projects, and personnel training in the field of aging. The law also established the Administration on Aging (AoA) to administ er the newly created grant programs and to serve as the federal focal point on matters concerning older persons. The OAA authorizes a wide array of service programs through a national network of state agencies on aging, area agencies on aging, service providers, and Tribal organizations. The OAA also includes community service employment for low -income older Americans; training, research, and demonstration activities in the field of aging; and vulnerable elder rights protection activities . Guardianship services and alternatives represent rel evant recipients for OAA funds and this funding source should be explored. 34 Conclusion State law states: \"It is the intent of the legislature to protect the liberty and autonomy of all people of this state, and to enable them to exercise their rights under the law to the maximum extent, consistent with the capacity of each person. The legislature recognizes that people with incapacities have unique abilities and needs , and that some people with incapacities cannot exercise their rights or provide for their basic needs without the help of a guardian. However, their liberty and autonomy should be restricted through the guardianship process only to the minimum extent necessary to adequately provide for their own health or safety , or to adequately manage their financial affairs\". (RCW 11.88.005) Legislative intent recognizes that decisional capacity is not global and that decisions concerning the liberty and autonomy of i ndividuals should be person- centered and individualized. Implementing the recommendations included, honors the intent of the Legislature. "}
