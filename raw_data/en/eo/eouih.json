In 2017, BRFSS collected 7,699 telephone interviews from residents aged 18 and older living in private residences or college housing. The interview included questions regarding health conditions, health-related behaviors, attitudes and awareness of major contributors to illness, disability and premature death over an average of 27 minutes. BRFSS also monitors the prevalence of these indicators over time statewide. Health-related issues including general health status, health care access, tobacco use, alcohol consumption, body weight, physical activity, nutrition, diabetes, respiratory conditions, immunizations, cancer screening and HIV/AIDS testing are tracked over time. Comparisons to other states, as well as to Healthy People 2020 and Healthy Iowans goals are important ways the Iowa BRFSS is used to evaluate progress towards the attainment of health across the state. Significant findings for 2017 include: The downward trend in the percentage of people without health care coverage leveled off. Iowa was one of seven states reporting obesity rates at or above 35%. Although the percentage of obese Iowans was steady, the percentage of Iowans above a healthy weight was the highest in six years. Cigarette smoking showed a decline, especially in the youngest age group. This is likely due, in part, to a switch to e-cigarettes. There were only four states with a higher prevalence of reported binge drinking, and only two states that had a higher percentage reporting driving while intoxicated. The percentage of Iowans age 65 and older who received a flu vaccination ranked second among states. The prevalence of people receiving a pneumonia shot was the highest in six years for the second year in a row; four out of five Iowans 65+ had ever received the pneumonia vaccine.BRFSS is the nation's premier state-based system of health-related telephone surveys. FACT Although Iowans age 65+ reported the lowest percentage of receiving the flu vaccine, Iowa was the fifth highest state for flu vaccination prevalence among this age group. There were only two states with a lower percentage than Iowa for people being tested for HIV. The percentage of adults reporting being diagnosed with depression was the lowest level found in the past six years, and was a major reversal of the trend from previous years. To date, the highest rate of skin cancer among adult Iowans was reported in 2017. Over half of Iowans who reported 6 or more ACEs had also been told in their lifetime that they had a depressive disorder, and about 1/3 reported frequent mental distress. Fruit and vegetable consumption was the lowest among Iowans with low education and income. Only four states had a lower rate of current asthma.Iowa Department of Public Health 2017 BRFSS Annual Report6Glossary 95% Confidence Interval: a range of values in which there is a 95% chance of the true value.

In 1988, Iowa began full participation in BRFSS. The BRFSS is now conducted in all 50 states, the District of Columbia and a few American territories. Nature of the Survey The Iowa BRFSS is an ongoing telephone survey. It is financially and technically supported by the CDC with further financial support from public and private sources. The BRFSS is designed to collect information from residents age 18 and over living in private residences or college housing on health conditions, health-related behaviors, attitudes and awareness. It also monitors the prevalence of these indicators over time. The indicators surveyed are major contributors to illness, disability and premature death. This report focuses on the data collected during calendar year 2017. Some of the health-related issues discussed are general health status, health care access, cancer screening, tobacco use, alcohol consumption, body weight, physical activity, oral health, diabetes, respiratory conditions, immunizations and HIV/AIDS awareness. Objectives The objectives of the BRFSS are: 1. To determine the state specific prevalence of personal health behaviors related to the leading causes of premature death. 2. To develop the capacity of state health departments to conduct credible telephone surveys. 3. To advance the understanding that certain health-related behaviors are critical indicators of health.Use of BRFSS Data The CDC developed the BRFSS to help states assess health risks and monitor trends. Comparable surveillance methods are used in all states. This allows for comparisons among states and for the assessment of geographic patterns of risk factor prevalence. The BRFSS information is used to design, implement and support public health activities. These activities are designed to reduce the premature death and disability of Iowa residents. State public health departments are responsible for planning, implementing and evaluating disease prevention programs. Many of these programs involve health risk behavior modification. Examples of health risk behavior modification programs in Iowa are the Diabetes Prevention and Control program, nutrition and physical activity campaigns, tobacco cessation and counter-marketing campaigns, campaigns encouraging flu vaccination, and campaigns to increase health screenings and checkups. One way to assess program effectiveness is to monitor the prevalence of risk factors in the population. Comparing different time periods, demographic groups or geographic areas may be quite useful in developing, implementing and evaluating intervention programs. The BRFSS information is used to design, implement and support public health activities to reduce the premature death and disability of Iowa residents.FACTIowa Department of Public Health 2017 BRFSS Annual Report9Methodology Questionnaire Design The BRFSS questionnaire is updated each calendar year by the CDC and by each participating state. The questionnaire consists of three sections: 1) the core questions required of all states participating in BRFSS; 2) a set of standardized modules developed by the CDC which states may opt to include in their survey; and 3) state-added questions which are designed and administered by individual states to address locally identified health problems. Changes in core and optional module questions were discussed and determinations were made whether to offer them at an annual national BRFSS meeting. They have been previously tested. A group of interested individuals from the Iowa Department of Public Health, guided by the state coordinator, met to discuss which optional modules and state-added questions to include in the coming year. The emerging survey plan was reviewed by the Iowa BRFSS Advisory Committee. Participation by Iowans in the BRFSS survey is random, voluntary, anonymous and confidential. Survey participants are requested to provide demographic information such as sex, race, marital and employment status, annual household income, educational level and location of residence by county and ZIP code. Information that could possibly be used to identify the respondent, such as location, is suppressed in public use data. Sampling Process Two sampling frames are used in the BRFSS. One is for landline telephones, while the other is for cell phones. Only adults age 18 years and older are interviewed in both samples. People residing in group homes or institutions are not sampled. In the landline sample, one residing person per household is interviewed. Households are selected using list-assisted random-digit dialing. This method provides a list of randomly chosen phone numbers from the pool of all existing landline phone numbers. These numbers are not drawn in a simple random fashion, but use what is known as the disproportionate stratified sampling technique (DSS). This sampling methodology is designed to produce a random sample of Iowa telephone numbers, including unlisted numbers and new subscribers, in an efficient fashion. The DSS method divides landline phone numbers into two strata. The first stratum is residential but unlisted. The second stratum is composed of residential listed numbers. Each stratum is sampled at a different rate. The listed residential numbers are sampled at the highest rate. Some numbers were marked by the list provider as not to be called because they have been predetermined to be nonresidential or nonworking. There was no set number to be sampled per group and completed interviews were not thrown out. The landline sample is also stratified into six geographic regions. These regions are the same regions used by health resource and emergency planning groups within the state. The geographic regions in each strata represent the same proportion of their population within the state. A seventh stratum was drawn from census tracts throughout the state containing a relatively high percentage of African American or Hispanic residents in an effort to better represent minority groups in Iowa. There was also an eighth stratum that oversampled counties of special interest to the diabetes program. Increasingly, many people, including the young, single, ethnic minorities and renters, are opting to use cell phones instead of traditional landline telephone service (AAPOR Cell Phone Task Force 2010; Blumberg & Luke 2017). Therefore, another sampling frame has been added for individuals using cell phones. Iowans are interviewed on whichever phone type they are reached at. The number of cell phone interviews was set large enough that more than 25% of the sample should be users of cell phones only. The cell phone sample was also geographically stratified into the six regions. The oversample strata were not done, since it is not possible to determine such specific geography for cell phones. Since the cell phone is more an individual appliance than a household appliance, the selection of one person per household was not done. College housing was included in the cell phone sample. These respondents were also asked some extra questions; for instance, they were asked if they were doing anything that would make it unsafe to conduct the interview, and not interviewed if they were. All information collected through BRFSS interviews is confidential. No names or addresses are collected during the interview.Iowa Department of Public Health 2017 BRFSS Annual Report10Methodology continued Because of mobility of cell phone use, there were occasions when cell phone interviews were done involving people living in other states. The number of cell phone interviews in our sample is, therefore, larger than the number called by our data collection contractor. Cell phone interviews from other states only contained responses to the core questions, since there was no way for them to know which modules we were using or our state added questions. Approximately equal numbers of interviews per month were conducted from January through December in 2017 for a total sample size of 7,699. Of these, 3,728 were landline and 3,529 were cell phone. Interviews were conducted in both English and Spanish. Interviewers made multiple attempts to reach a number to complete an interview before replacing that number. If the person selected to take the survey was not available, an appointment was made to complete the interview at another date and time. If the person was not available during the interview period, or if the person refused to participate, no other person was interviewed at that number. Attempts were made to convert initial refusals into participants. The Interview Process The interviews were conducted daytime, evenings and weekends with appointments as needed to schedule or complete interviews. The average time to complete an interview was 25.8 minutes for landline and 23.5 minutes for cell phone. The response rate, defined as completed interviews + partial completes divided by all eligible households called, was 53% for landline and 55% for cell phones. Although the response rates seem rather low and have been declining in recent years, they are better than most states produce. Not all interviews were fully completed. A partial complete is an interview that was terminated before it was complete, but sufficient data had been collected to use for most measures. This means that results from questions later in the questionnaire are determined from a somewhat smaller sample than earlier questions, even when not restricted to some sub-sample such as a particular age group. See Appendix for the questions and their order.A Computer Aided Telephone Interviewing (CATI) system is used. The CATI system not only assists interviewers in presenting the questionnaire and recording the responses, it also helps keep track of appointments and callback attempts, and reports statistics of call dispositions. Advantages and Limitations Telephone interviews provide a means to conduct affordable surveys to monitor the prevalence of behavioral risk factors. Surveys based on telephone interviews are much faster to complete than surveys based on in-person interviews. In one hour, an experienced telephone interviewer can handle busy numbers, calls not answered and refusals to participate, and still successfully complete one and one-half interviews. In contrast, in one day of in-person interviewing, many miles of travel may be required with few interviews completed. Another advantage of telephone surveys is the much higher response rate compared to self-administered surveys, such as mail surveys. Supervision and administration are simpler for telephone interviews than for in-person interviews. All calls can be made from one central location and supervisors can monitor interviewers for quality control. One main limitation to telephone surveys is that all Iowans are not reachable by telephone. Some do not live in households, but are in institutions such as nursing homes or prisons. Some households do not have telephones. Persons of low socioeconomic status are less likely than persons of higher socioeconomic status to have uninterrupted telephone service and are therefore under-sampled. Furthermore, the percentage of households with a telephone varies by region. New telephone technology such as caller I.D. and call blockers that block telemarketers also pose problems for telephone surveys. Furthermore, some inaccuracy is expected from any survey based on self-reported information. For example, Iowa had a 70% landline and 90% cell phone interview completion rate among eligible respondents in 2017.Iowa Department of Public Health 2017 BRFSS Annual Report11Methodology continued respondents are known to under-report their weight and inaccurately recall socially undesirable habits. People's memories may also fail or play tricks on them. The potential for bias must always be kept in mind when interpreting self-reported data. Despite these limitations, prevalence estimates from the BRFSS correspond well with findings from surveys based on in-person interviews and actual physical measurements, including studies conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics and the American Heart Association. Analysis of the data Unless everyone in the state was asked questions about their health, there would be no way to know exactly what these answers would be. When analyzing BRFSS data, conclusions are to be drawn about the entire adult population of the state of Iowa based on only a sample of randomly chosen people. The true prevalence in the population can only be estimated. The judgment of the value of prevalence in a population, such as the state based on the prevalence within a sample, always involves educated guesswork. The prevalence values from the survey and the true state population prevalence values may differ by some amount, but a range of state values that are probably true can be determined with a high degree of confidence from the prevalence in the sample. Most charts and tables in this report will indicate a range of values in which there is a 95% chance of the true Iowa value falling. This range is referred to as a 95% confidence interval (CI). Charts will indicate this by use of a black line at the end of the bars in the chart. The end of the bar is the sample value, while the value in the population is probably somewhere in the range represented by the line. When the CIs of two or more groups do not overlap, their population values can be considered truly or significantly different.An important factor in determining how well we can judge the response of all Iowans from the survey sample is the number of responses to the questions. The smaller the number of responses, the poorer is our ability to draw a conclusion about the whole state. Analyzing the data by such categories as age, sex, income, educational level and especially race/ethnicity means there are a smaller number of interviews in each particular group than in the whole survey. Furthermore, many questions are only answered depending on the answer to previous questions. For instance, a person would only be asked at what age they were diagnosed with diabetes if they answer \"yes\" to whether they have ever been told they had diabetes. These smaller numbers decrease the ability to determine statistically significant differences. Some data may not be reported as significant solely due to small sample sizes. In general, data in which the number of responses is less than 50 or the variability is too large (coefficient of variability greater than 30%) will not be reported since this data is considered highly unreliable. Some people refuse to answer select questions, but choose to respond to the majority of the questions. Those interviews were still used in the final count for the total sample size. However, they were not counted on the specific questions they refused. Unless otherwise indicated, prevalence measures do not include those who refused to answer a question or said they did not know. Weighting of the Data Generally, the best guess for how many Iowa adults would answer a question a certain way would be the same as how many adults in the sample answer that way. This is true, however, only if everyone in the state had an equal chance of being in the sample. This is not the case. The number of adults per household and the number of phone numbers per household influence a person's likelihood of being included in the survey. Furthermore, certain demographic groups may be over or under-represented in the sample based on their ease of being reached and willingness to respond. For instance, about half the adult Iowa population is male, but typically only about 40% of the sample interviewed is male. To solve these problems, the data in the sample is weighted to the state population. That means several of the above factors are used to give each interview a weight that represents a certain distinct number of people in the state population. The data collected in the BRFSS are obtained through a complex sample design. The direct application of standard statistical analysis methods for variance estimation and hypothesis testing may yield misleading results.Iowa Department of Public Health 2017 BRFSS Annual Report12Methodology continued A large number of factors are considered in the weighting process. Age, gender, race/ethnicity, marital status, education level, home ownership, geographic region and cell vs. landline telephone are all considered. Preliminary weights from the ratio of sampled phone numbers to all numbers are adjusted recursively by these factors until a stable weight is produced. A landline telephone is seen as a household appliance, while a cell phone is more frequently seen as an individual possession. This means adults per household and phone numbers per household become irrelevant for cell phones. These two factors are not used in determining weights for cell phone interviews. This weighting method, known as iterative proportional fitting (IPF), has been in place since 2011. Five-year trend information in this report will only be determined from 2012 forward. Comparisons of pre-2011 data against post-2011 may be unsound data due to the change in data collection methodology for Core section of the questionnaire. For optional module and state added questions, 2012 was the first year cell phone interviews were included in the research design. References: 1. AAPOR Cell Phone Task Force.

Additional studies that controlled for objective health status, age, sex, life satisfaction, income, residence and other factors continue to find that the risk of mortality is two to six times greater for those individuals who had reported earlier that their health was bad or poor, compared to those who had reported their health as excellent (DeSalvo, Bloser, Reynolds, He, & Muntner, 2006). The risk associated with poor self-rated health was actually higher than the risks associated with poor health status assessments by a physician. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has defined health-related quality of life (HRQOL) as \"an individual's or group's perceived physical and mental health over time\" (Centers for Disease Control, 2016). Tracking health-related quality of life in different populations can identify subgroups with poor physical or mental health, and can help guide policies or interventions to improve their health. General Health Status Results In 2017, when asked how their health was in general, 16.0% of Iowans reported that it was excellent, which was a decline from the previous year's rate of 17.8%. Another 35.2% rated their health as very good. Additionally, 33.5% of Iowans reported their health to be good, while 15.4% rated their health as fair or poor, an increase from 2016, when 13.0% of Iowans rated their health as fair or poor (see Figure 4.1). Age, education, household income and race/ethnicity all had a significant impact on reported health status (see Table 4.1). While 5.8% of those from households earning $75,000 or more per year reported fair or poor health, 40.4% of those from households earning less than $15,000 per year did so. Other respondents who tended to report having fair or poor health were those with less than a high school education. Hispanics reported the highest rates of fair to poor general health status at 24.5%.

Four measures of poor health - low general health, frequent physical distress, frequent mental distress and frequent activity limitation are derived from data collected through these questions. In answer to the question asking how many out of the past 30 days their physical health was not good, 10.3% of Iowans reported experiencing 14 or more days of poor physical health. Approximately 27.1% of Iowans with household incomes less than $15,000 reported having 14 or more bad physical health days, while 5.1% of those with household incomes of $75,000 or more reported experiencing 14 or more days of bad physical health in the 30 days preceding the interview. As shown in Table 4.2, more females, Iowans over 65, those with lower education and those with lower income reported 14 or more bad physical health days. In answer to the general mental health question, \"Now thinking about your mental health, which includes stress, depression and problems with emotions, for how many days during the past 30 days was your mental health not good?\", persons who reported that their mental health was not good for greater than or equal to 14 of the preceding 30 days were defined as having frequent mental distress (FMD). In 2017, 10.8% of Iowans reported experiencing FMD, which was similar to the 2016 rate of 10.0%. Men, older people, those with high education and those with high income had a lower prevalence of FMD.Table 4.2: Percentage of Self-Reported days of Poor Physical and Mental Health in past 30 days, 2017 Demographic Groups14 - 30 Days of Poor Physical Health14 - 30 Days of Poor Mental Health Prevalence Rate (%)C.I.

Access to health services means the timely use of personal health services to achieve the best health outcomes. Access to health care usually requires distinct steps: Entry into the health care system usually through insurance coverage Identifying a primary health care provider whom the patient trusts and can communicate with effectively on an ongoing basis The ability to access health care services as soon as they are needed in a viable geographic location Access to health care impacts one's overall physical, social and mental health status as well as quality of life. Americans experience variable access to care based on race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, age, sex, disability status, sexual orientation, gender identity and residential location. Barriers to health services such as the cost, lack of available services or culturally knowledgeable care or inadequate/no insurance coverage can lead to unmet health needs, financial burdens, the inability to receive preventative care and delays in receiving the appropriate kind of care (Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, 2020). Insurance Coverage and Access to Health Care Results The percentage of people without health insurance coverage plummeted after the Affordable Care Act took effect in 2010. For adult Iowans aged 18 to 99, in 2016, this downward trend shifted: there was an increasing number of people who indicated that they were not covered by any type of health insurance. This trend continued for 2017 when 7.2% of all adult Iowans (aged 18 to 99) reported they did not have health insurance. For adult Iowans aged 18 to 64 years old, the percentage of uninsured individuals has decreased since 2012 and remained stable for the past two years at 7.8%, but started to climb in 2017 (see Figure 5.1). In 2017, 8.6% of Iowans between age 18 and 64 years of age indicated that they were not covered by any type of health insurance, which is the highest percentage since 2014. All remaining findings for coverage are for this age group, since almost everyone 65 years and older is covered by Medicare. Figure 5.1: No Health Insurance Trend 2012 - 2017 Iowans Age 18-64 Table 5.1 shows that for people between ages 18 and 64 years old, those without health care coverage tended to be male, young, less educated and have a lower household income. Additionally, Hispanic Iowans lacked health care coverage at the highest rate (27.5%) compared to those who were White/Non-Hispanic, Black/Non-Hispanic and Other/Non-Hispanic. People with less than a high school education and those who were Hispanic had the highest percentages of individuals without health care coverage (28.1% and 27.5% respectively). College graduates had fewer than 3.0% having no coverage, which was a lower rate than any other education level (see Table 5.1). 14 12 10 8 6 4 2 0Percent 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 13.4 12.7 9.6 7.8 7.8 8.6 Year Percent Iowa Department of Public Health 2017 BRFSS Annual Report17Insurance Coverage and Access to Health Care continued Table 5.1: Percentage of uninsured Iowans age 18-64, 2017 Demographic GroupsPrevalence (%)C.I. (95%) other demographic variables that had an impact on health care coverage for those under the age of 65 were employment status and marital status. In 2017, 14.4% of unemployed Iowans reported not being covered by health insurance, while 7.4% of employed or self-employed individuals reported not being covered. Unemployed excludes people who are retired or unable to work. People who were married tended to be covered by health care insurance at higher rates compared to those who were not. For example, 11.6% of unmarried respondents were uninsured, while 5.8% of married respondents lacked coverage. When asked if there was a time in the past 12 months when they needed to see a doctor but could not because of the cost, 7.9% of all adult Iowans said that there was (see Table 5.2). The percentage was higher for younger people, people with less education, people with lower incomes and racial and ethnic minorities. The lowest percentages were reported by people with annual household incomes of $75,000 or more, Iowans aged 65 years or older and college graduates. These groups had between 2.7% and 4.4% not covered. The highest percentages were found among Black/Non- Hispanic and Hispanic adult Iowans at 17.7% and 18.9%, respectively, not seeking care due to the cost. From 2016 to 2017, the percentage of Hispanic Iowans who needed to see a doctor but could not because of cost remained stable (19.0% in 2016 vs. 18.9% in 2017), which indicates no significant improvement among this population. More Black/Non-Hispanic Iowans were unable to afford to seek medical care due to the cost in 2017 than in 2016 (17.7% and 12.4% respectively). In 2017, a lower percentage of adult Iowans of Other/Non-Hispanic race and ethnicity reported not being able to access care due to cost than in 2016 (12.4% in 2017 vs. 20.8% in 2016), indicating an improvement among this population of Iowans. The percentage of uninsured Iowans age 18 to 64 has continued to increase since 2015.FACT Iowa Department of Public Health 2017 BRFSS Annual Report18Insurance Coverage and Access to Health Care continued Table 5.2: Percentage of responses to health care access related questions in Iowa, 2017 Demographic GroupsTime Couldn't Afford Care Have One Person as Health Provider Had Checkup in Past Year % C.I. (95%) % Iowans had one regular health care provider in 2017.FACT Iowa Department of Public Health 2017 BRFSS Annual Report19Insurance Coverage and Access to Health Care continued Since it is important that care be coordinated, respondents were asked if they had one person they thought of as their personal doctor or health care provider. A positive reply was given by 73.3% of adult Iowans, which was about a 4% decrease from 2016. Women, Non-Hispanic Whites, older people, people with more education and people with higher household incomes reported a higher prevalence of having one regular provider. Hispanic Iowans and those aged 25-34 years old had the lowest rates of having one regular provider (58.7% and 59.4% respectively), while those age 65 years old and older had the highest rate (83.2%). When asked how long it had been since their last regular checkup, 70.4% said within the past year, which was a decrease from the 71.6% who indicated this in 2016. On the other end, 1.2% of adult Iowans indicated that they had never had a checkup, which was a slight increase from the percentage reported in 2016. More females than males reported having a checkup within the past year. Iowans aged 65 years or older reported the highest rates of having a recent checkup, while those aged 25-34 reported the lowest rate of having a recent checkup. Black/Non-Hispanic Iowans had significantly higher rates of a recent checkup in the past year compared to Non-Hispanic Whites, Hispanics, and those who were Non-Hispanic and reported a different race. From 2016 to 2017, Non-Hispanic Blacks as well as Iowans who indicated being Non-Hispanic and of another race indicated they had received a checkup within the past 12 months, though increases for both of these populations were not statistically different from each other, indicating similar trends over the two years. In 2016, fewer than three out of five Iowans of Other/Non-Hispanic race and ethnicity reported having a checkup within the last year, while in 2017, this increased to over three in five (67.0%). The percentage of Non-Hispanic Black Iowans reporting a recent checkup increased from 75.9% to 84.3%. Comparison with Other States In the 50 states and District of Columbia, the percentage of those under age 65 without health insurance ranged widely from 5.9% to 28.4%. Iowa had 8.6% of respondents under age 65 reporting not having any health insurance. Only five states had a lower percentage of individuals without health insurance than Iowa, including Hawaii and states in the northeastern region of the United States. The median for the 50 states and the District of Columbia was 12.7%, which was slightly higher than the median in 2016 (12.3%).Health Objectives for Iowa and the Nation The Healthy People 2020 and Healthy Iowans goals for health insurance coverage are to see increases in the proportion of people who are covered by health insurance so that all people will be covered by some form of health insurance. In Iowa, 91.4% of adults aged 18 to 64 reported coverage in 2017. For all adults (aged 18 to 99) the figure was 92.8%. Both percentages are lower than in 2016, indicating a trend in the opposite direction than the proposed goals and ultimately falling short. There are separate Healthy People goals for people age 18 to 64 and people 65 and over in terms of having a specific source of ongoing care. The goal for 18 to 64 is 89.4%, while the goal for age 65 and over is 100%. The results for Iowans indicating they had one person as a health provider were 70.4% (18-64 year olds) and 83.2% (65 years and older). The Healthy Iowans goal for all adults was 82.0%. The obtained prevalence for all Iowans of 73.3% also falls short. Healthy Iowans also has a goal of decreasing the percentage of adults who are not able to see a doctor because of the cost to 7%. With 7.9% of adult Iowans indicating they could not afford to see a doctor due to the cost, the state has not yet reached the goal. Healthy Iowans also has a goal of increasing the percentage of adults who have had a routine check-up in the past year to 76%. Again, Iowa has fallen short of the goal with only 70.4% of adults having one in the past year. Iowa is the 6th leading state for the percentage of insured adults but is moving in the opposite direction of state and national goals.FACTReferences 1.

Iowa Department of Public Health 2017 BRFSS Annual Report20Hypertension Awareness Background Blood pressure is the force of blood against the walls of arteries. If this pressure rises and stays high over time, it can damage the body in many ways. High blood pressure (HBP), also known as hypertension, is a serious condition that can lead to coronary heart disease, heart failure, stroke, kidney failure and other health problems if not controlled or lowered (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2020; National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, 2020). Blood pressure is typically recorded as two numbers - the systolic pressure (as the heart beats) over the diastolic pressure (as the heart relaxes between beats). High blood pressure is defined as a consistent reading of systolic blood pressure at or above 130 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) or diastolic blood pressure at or above 80 mm Hg. Those with systolic blood pressure of 120-129 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure of less than 80 mm Hg are now classified as pre-hypertensive, requiring health-promoting lifestyle modifications to prevent cardiovascular disease (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2020). High blood pressure, which often has no symptoms, is a major risk factor for heart disease and stroke. Almost 500,000 deaths in the United States are linked to HBP as either a primary or a contributing cause (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2020). Epidemiological data suggest that if we could lower the average systolic blood pressure among Americans by 5 mm Hg, we'd see a 14.0% decrease in deaths from stroke, a 9.0% drop in heart disease deaths, and a 7.0% drop in overall mortality. A reduction as small as 2 mm Hg in the average American's systolic blood pressure could save more than 70,000 lives per year (Havas, Roccella, & Lenfant, 2004). People who have high blood pressure can take steps to control it and reduce their risks for related health problems. The population-based lifestyle intervention recommendations are weight loss, dietary sodium restrictions, increased physical activity, smoking cessation, moderation of alcohol consumption, adequate good quality sleep, stress management, and a heart-healthy diet rich in fiber, with increased potassium from fruit and vegetables and low in saturated and total fat (National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, 2020). Other key steps include taking medication and following the treatment plan that your doctor may prescribe.Figure 6.1: Iowans Ever Told Blood Pressure 18-24 25-34 35-44 45-54 30.0 45.9 55.3 61.8 70 60 50 40 30 20 10 0Percent Ages PercentHypertension Awareness Results In 2017, 31.5%, or approximately 762,404, of adult Iowans reported ever being told they had high blood pressure. An additional 0.9% (21,753 adult Iowans) reported being told they had borderline or pre-hypertension. The prevalence of reporting a high blood pressure diagnosis was higher among adult Iowans with lower levels of education and with lower levels of household income. Non-Hispanic Whites reported higher rates of high blood pressure than adult Iowans of Other/Non-Hispanic or Hispanic race and ethnicity (see Table 6.1). Rates among Non-Hispanic Whites (and Non-Hispanic Blacks) were above 30%, while rates for Iowans of Other/Non-Hispanic or Hispanic race and ethnicity were well under 30% (22.1% and 21.4% respectively). Age had the greatest impact on the percentage of respondents reporting high blood pressure. The highest percentage of high blood pressure was reported among respondents age 75 years and older (60.5%; three out of five Iowans). The lowest percentage was reported among those age 18 to 24 (8.4%; see Figure 6.1). Though, the trend for high blood pressure among 18 to 24 year olds has increased, as 4.2% in this age group had ever been told they had high blood pressure in 2015.Iowa Department of Public Health 2017 BRFSS Annual Report21Hypertension Awareness continued Table 6.1: Percentage of Iowans Told Blood Pressure Is High, 2017 References 1.

Demographic GroupsPrevalence reporting high blood pressure, 77.5% reported taking medication for their condition. Like high blood pressure, this percentage increases steadily with age reaching a high of 94.4% among those 75 years old and older. More females with high blood pressure took blood pressure medicine than males (81.8% versus 73.5%). Education and income showed no systematic relation to use of blood pressure medication. Comparison with Other States Among all 50 states and the District of Columbia, prevalence of reported hypertension ranged from 27.9% to 39.7%. The prevalence among Iowans (31.5%) was better than the national median of 33.0%. Health Objectives for Iowa and the Nation According to Healthy People 2020, the objective for high blood pressure is that only 26.9% of the adult population should report having high blood pressure. Iowa fails to meet this goal, as of 2017, with a rate of 31.5%. Another Healthy People 2020 goal is for 77.4% of people with high blood pressure to be taking medication to lower it. The Healthy Iowans goal for this is a rate of 75%. Iowa's figure was 77.5%. Iowa meets the Healthy People 2020 and Healthy Iowans goals for taking blood pressure medication to manage high blood pressure.Iowa Department of Public Health 2017 BRFSS Annual Report22Cholesterol Awareness Background High blood cholesterol is one of the major risk factors for heart disease. The higher your blood cholesterol level, the greater your risk is for developing heart disease or having a heart attack. Cholesterol is a waxy, fat-like substance that is found in all cells of the body. Cholesterol travels through your blood within small packages called lipoproteins. When there is too much cholesterol, it builds up in the walls of your arteries. Over time, this buildup causes \"hardening of the arteries\" so that arteries become narrowed and blood flow to the heart is slowed down or blocked. The blood carries oxygen to the heart, and if enough blood and oxygen cannot reach your heart, you may suffer chest pain. If the blood supply to a portion of the heart is completely cut off by a blockage, the result is a heart attack (National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, 2021). High blood cholesterol itself does not cause symptoms; so many people are unaware that their cholesterol level is too high. It is important to find out what your cholesterol numbers are because lowering cholesterol levels that are too high lessens the risk for developing heart disease and reduces the chance of a heart attack or dying of heart disease, even if you already have it. Lowering cholesterol is important for everyone: younger, middle-aged, and older adults; women and men; and people with or without heart disease. Everyone aged 20 and older should have their cholesterol measured at least once every 5 years. High cholesterol means a total cholesterol level greater than or equal to 200 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dl). Not all cholesterol increases the risk of heart disease. The cholesterol carried by low-density lipoproteins (LDL), \"bad cholesterol\", increases the risk; levels of LDL should be less than 100 mg/dl. The cholesterol carried by high-density lipoproteins (HDL), \"good cholesterol\", lowers the risk and is beneficial; levels of HDL are recommended to be greater than or equal to 60 mg/dl. Cholesterol standards are more stringent for those people at high risk of heart attack due to other factors such as diabetes or coronary heart disease (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2020).The main goal of cholesterol-lowering prevention and treatment is to lower your LDL (bad) cholesterol level enough to reduce your risk of developing heart disease or having a heart attack. Methods include: DASH Eating Plan: a flexible and balanced eating plan that creates a heart-healthy eating style for life that recommends eating vegetables, fruits, and whole grains, including fat-free or low-fat dairy products, fish, poultry, nuts, beans, and vegetable oils, limiting food foods that are high in saturated fats and limiting sugar-sweetened beverages and sweets (National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, 2021). Maintaining a healthy weight Getting regular physical activity Smoking cessation Limiting the consumption of alcohol Checking your cholesterol regularly Medication: if cholesterol-lowering medicines are needed, they should be used as directed along with healthy lifestyle changes (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2017) Cholesterol Awareness Results In 2017, when asked whether they had their blood cholesterol checked during the past five years, 84.4% of respondents reported having done so. Women, respondents in older age groups, people with more education and higher household income had higher prevalence rates of having a blood cholesterol test within the last five years. Hispanic Iowans had lower rates of having their blood cholesterol checked in the past five years than White Non-Hispanic Iowans (see Table 7.1). Of the respondents who had their cholesterol tested in the past five years, 34.1% reported that they had ever been told by a doctor or other health professional that their blood cholesterol was high. Non-Hispanic Whites had a higher rate (35.0%) compared to Hispanic Iowans. Adult Iowans who were college graduates reported high cholesterol at a lower rate than those with a high school diploma/G.E.D. or some post high school education. A similar trend was seen within household income, with those earning a higher income reporting high cholesterol at lower rates. For example, 38.1% of adult Iowans earning less than $15,000 per year reported high cholesterol, while 28.5% of adult Iowans Iowa Department of Public Health 2017 BRFSS Annual Report23Cholesterol Awareness continued Table 7.1: Blood Cholesterol in Iowans, 2017 Demographic GroupsHad Blood Cholesterol Checked in Past Five YearsEver Been Told Blood Cholesterol High % C.I. (95%) % C.I. (95%) Total or more reported high cholesterol. Age made a considerable difference in reported high cholesterol. Among 18 to 24 year olds, 6.7% reported high cholesterol, while 56.3% of those age 65 to 74 reported high cholesterol (see Table 7.1). Comparison with Other States The percentage of people having their cholesterol checked within the past five years among all 50 states and the District of Columbia ranged from 75.1% to 91.4%. Iowa's rate of 84.4% was below the national median of 85.9%. Of those tested, the range being told their cholesterol was high was from 27.9% to 39.7%. Iowa's rate of 34.1% was higher than the national median of 33.0%. Health Objectives for the Nation Based on the national health objectives, by the year 2020, 82.1% of adults should have their blood cholesterol checked within the past five years. In 2017, 84.4% of Iowans age 18 and older had their blood cholesterol checked within the past five years, which meets and exceeds this goal. High cholesterol should be experienced by only 13.5% of all people over age 20 according to the Healthy People 2020 goal. Iowa is nowhere near meeting this goal, with the rate more than doubling that amount at 34.7% of Iowans aged 20 years and older reporting high cholesterol. References 1.

Iowa Department of Public Health 2017 BRFSS Annual Report24Overweight and Obesity Background Overweight and obesity status reflect both individual and society-level aspects that consist of inherited, environmental, cultural and socioeconomic factors. Contributing individual factors include behavior and genetics, as well as dietary patterns, physical activity and inactivity, medication use and other exposures. Community level factors such as food and physical activity environment; education and skills; and food marketing and promotion play an important role in overweight and obesity prevalence rates (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2021). Obesity is a serious public health concern as it is linked to an increase in risk factors for heart disease, cancer and stroke, which are all leading causes of death. It is also associated with Type II diabetes, atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries), gout, asthma, hypertension, sleep apnea and osteoarthritis (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2021) as well as poorer mental health outcomes and reduced quality of life (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2021). Strategies to combat obesity would seek to advance policies that: Increase the availability of affordable healthy foods in all communities; Improve access to safe and healthy places to live, work, learn and play; Increase the frequency, intensity and duration of physical activity; Limit screen time; and Encourage employers to provide workplace wellness programs. Overweight and obesity status are often estimated from weight standards that are adjusted for body frame. Carefully measured weight and height remain the most easily performed and useful means to determine nutritional status and to predict mortality for the general population (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2021). Body mass index (BMI) is the most frequently used measure to determine the appropriateness of weight for a person's height. BMI is defined as a person's body weight in kilograms divided by their height in meters squared [weight (kg)/height (m2)]. Estimations of the prevalence of overweight and obesity in this report are based on BMI determined from self-reported weight and height. In adults, overweight is considered to be a BMI value greater than or equal to 25 and less than 30, while obesity is considered to be a BMI greater than or equal to 30. This self-report method is likely to result in an underestimation of the actual extent of obesity. However, comparisons among demographic groups, states and years are likely to be valid. Furthermore, this is the only measure of overweight and obesity available on the state level. Overweight and Obesity Results In 2017, 33.7% of non-pregnant adult Iowans were overweight and 36.4% were obese, based on BMI. The combined percentage of individuals who were overweight or obese was 70.1%, which was higher than the combined prevalence in 2016 of 68.7%. Likewise, the rate of obesity in the state of Iowa significantly increased over the 2016 rate of 32%, and was the highest reported rate in the last six years (see Figure 8.1). An analysis by demographic factors shows an increase in obesity rates in females over males based on self-reported weights from 2016 to 2017. Prevalence of overweight increases steadily with age, while a decline is seen in obesity rates after age 65. In 2017, rates of obesity for females surpassed those of males between the ages of 18 and 34. From the age of 35, males had higher rates of obesity than females, especially from ages 75 and older (see Figure 8.2). The effects of education and income are different for over - weight and obesity as well. Obesity prevalence was lowest among college graduates. Adults without a high school diploma and those with a high school diploma or equivalent Figure 8.1: Overweight and Obesity by Year, 2012-2017 80 70 60 50 40 30 20 10 0 Overweight Obesity Combined2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 Public Health 2017 BRFSS Annual Report25Overweight and Obesity continued had the highest self-reported obesity rates at 39.5% and 39.9% respectively. Adults with some college (38.0%) and college graduates (28.9%) reported slightly lower rates. For overweight, education seemed to have little systematic effect on overweight rates. If anything, a higher percentage of college graduates tended to report being overweight. Likewise, the percentage of overweight tended to be lower among those who reported lower incomes while the opposite was true for obesity. Iowans who had an annual household income of $25,000 or less had a higher prevalence of obesity (see Table 8.1). Table 8.1: Overweight and Obesity Based on BMI, 2017Figure 8.2: Obesity by Age and Sex, 2017 Comparison to other states Iowa's obesity prevalence rate of 36.4% was well above the 2017 U.S. median rate of 31.3%, with a range from 22.6% to 38.1%. Iowa was one of seven states reporting obesity rates at or above 35% in 2017. For obesity and overweight combined, the Iowa rate of 70.1% was also higher than the U.S. median of 66.6% in 2017. Health Objectives for Iowa and the nation The Healthy People 2020 objectives for the nation to be achieved on weight call for increasing the prevalence of those with a healthy weight (neither overweight nor obese) to 33.9% among adults age 20 years and older. Iowa is slightly below this target, having 33.4% of its adult population at healthy weight. The Healthy People 2020 goal for obesity is 30.6%. With an adult obesity prevalence of those with a 36.4%, Iowa fails to achieve that goal.Demographic Groups Overweight 25.7 22.6 (18.3-26.9) 25 - 34 32.3 64 34.4 (31.7-37.1) 65 - 74 37.5 (34. -40.3) 37.4 (34.6-40.2) 75+ 40.9 (37.3-44.5) 26.5 (23.3-29.8) Education Less than $15,000 22.6 (18.1-27.1) (44.6-56.0) - 30.7 (28.5-32.9) References 1.

People who have type 1 diabetes are not able to produce insulin. Type 2 diabetes is most common (90% - 95% of all diagnosed cases) and is a condition that occurs when your body does not use insulin properly resulting in insulin resistance (American Diabetes Association, 2021; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2020). Diabetes is the 7th leading cause of death in the United States. In the last 2 decades, as the population has aged and become more overweight or obese, the number of U.S. adults diagnosed with diabetes has more than doubled (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2020). Currently, 34.2 million U.S. adults have diabetes and over 88 million have pre-diabetes. The majority of those who have prediabetes likely are unaware of their condition, and in many cases, pre-diabetes develops into full diabetes. The good news is that research studies have found that positive lifestyle changes can prevent or delay the onset of Type 2 diabetes among high-risk adults. Lifestyle interventions including diet modification, weight loss and moderate-intensity physical activity, such as walking for 2 1/2 hours each week, are recommended to delay diabetes onset in high-risk populations. The complications of diabetes are many and severe, and can include heart disease, stroke, high blood pressure, kidney disease, blindness, diseases of the nervous system, dental disease, complications during pregnancy, lower-limb amputations and lower resistance to other diseases. However, complications can be minimized when diabetes is diagnosed early and patients are taught to self-manage their disease through blood glucose control, weight control, taking medications appropriately, decreasing unhealthy lifestyle habits such as smoking, and implementing healthy lifestyle interventions (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2017). The Diabetes Prevention and Control Program at the Iowa Department of Public Health provides a resource for health care professionals regarding the latest guidelines for diabetes care, coordinates a statewide diabetes network, and collaborates with local community projects to develop initiatives on public awareness, prevention and other areas of disease management. It also certifies programs for Medicaid reimbursement and assists certified programs in maintaining quality standards for outpatient education. Diabetes Results In 2017, 9.6% of Iowans had ever been told by a physician that they have diabetes, excluding women told only during pregnancy. This is somewhat higher than the figure in 2016, when 9.3% of Iowans had ever been told that they have diabetes (see Figure 9.1). Diabetes may affect persons of all ages, although prevalence increases with age. Table 9.1 below shows that the rate of diabetes is much higher for Iowans who are older, lower in education and have a lower household income. In 2017, the demographic group with the highest percentage of diagnosed diabetics was those 75 years of age or older, at 22.6%. The demographic group with the lowest diabetes prevalence rate were Iowans between 18 and 24 years old (1.6%). In 2017, approximately 231,984 adult Iowans had diabetes. FACTIowa Department of Public Health 2017 BRFSS Annual Report27Diabetes continued Among individuals who had been told they had diabetes, 44.2% reported being first diagnosed between age 46 and 60. Just over 4% of those ever diagnosed with diabetes reported their age of first diagnosis at under 16 years of age. When asked if they had a test for diabetes in the past three years, over half (53.4%) of Iowans affirmed that they had, with the highest response being among Iowans between 65 to 74 years of age (75.5%). More attention is being given to pre or borderline diabetes. If left untreated, 15-30% of those with prediabetes will develop Type 2 diabetes. In 2017, 7.2%, or an estimated 74,621 Iowa adults, were told by their doctor that they have prediabetes. The highest percentage of these were among Black/Non-Hispanic and Other/Non-Hispanic populations, at 9.3% and 9.1% respectively. When analyzed by age group, Iowans between 65 and 74 years old reported the highest prediabetes rates (14.4%).Table 9.1: Iowans Ever Told They Had Demographic GroupsPrevalence Rate (%)C.I.

CVD most often means heart disease, heart failure or stroke. Heart disease includes coronary heart disease (CHD) or heart attack, also known as myocardial infarction (MI). Stroke refers to a sudden impairment of brain function, sometimes termed \"brain attack,\" which results from interruption of circulation to one or another part of the brain. Heart disease and stroke are mainly consequences of clogged arteries (atherosclerosis) and high blood pressure (hypertension). More than 80 million Americans currently live with a cardiovascular disease (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2019). Coronary heart disease is a leading cause of premature, permanent disability in the U.S. Stroke alone accounts for disability in nearly 1 million Americans. Each year, 15 to 30% of stroke survivors are permanently disabled. Suffering a stroke may lead to paralysis, speech difficulties and emotional problems (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2019). Following a heart attack, individuals frequently suffer fatigue and depression, and may find it more difficult to engage in physical activities. The economic impact of cardiovascular disease on our nation's health care system continues to grow as the population ages. About 1 in 6 health care dollars is devoted to cardiovascular disease. Heart disease and stroke cost the nation an estimated $316.6 billion in health care costs and lost productivity in 2011\u2014and these costs are rising (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2019). On a personal level, families who experience heart disease or stroke not only have to deal with medical bills, but also lost wages and the real potential of a decreased standard of living. Reducing cardiovascular disease risk requires an integrated strategy that includes: Lifestyle behavior change - weight management; increased physical activity; no tobacco use; a low fat, low-cholesterol diet with moderate sodium, sugar and alcohol intake; and control of high blood cholesterol, elevated blood pressure and diabetes. Community environmental support such as population screening to identify individuals with high levels of blood cholesterol, blood pressure, blood glucose and other individuals at risk for heart disease. Community support also includes interventions that teach the skills necessary for behavior change that make living a healthier life easier. One popular example is the establishment and upkeep of bicycle trails for use by the public. Development of public policies that encourage healthy lifestyle behaviors. These may be implemented in the form of laws, regulations, standards or guidelines that contribute to setting these and other social and environmental conditions. For example, dietary patterns result from the influences of food production policies, marketing practices, product availability, cost, convenience, knowledge and choices that affect health, and preferences that are often based on early- life habits. Each year, 15-30% of stroke survivors are permanently disabled.Iowa Department of Public Health 2017 BRFSS Annual Report30Cardiovascular Disease continued Cardiovascular Disease Results In 2017, 4.0% of adult Iowans had been told by a doctor that they had a heart attack or myocardial infarction; 4.1% had been told they had coronary heart disease or angina, and 3.1% had been told they had a stroke (see Table 10.1).

Additionally, regular physical activity can help to strengthen bones and muscles, improve mental health and quality of sleep as well as increase general quality of life. Despite the multitude of benefits, a large proportion of people in the United States remain inactive. Any physical activity is better than none and the more the better. According to the Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans, 2nd edition (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2018), adults should strive to engage in 150 minutes per week of moderate aerobic physical activity, 75 minutes per week of vigorous aerobic physical activity, or some combination. In addition, they should also engage in physical activity aimed at strengthening their muscles at a recommended level of at least two times per week. Although the percentage of people who do not engage in regular physical activity remains high, there are efforts in motion to try to increase the physical activity level of people across the United States, and in Iowa specifically (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2020; Iowa Department of Health, 2020). Interventions to increase physical activity include: 1. Designing communities where biking and walking is the easy choice. 2. Connecting activity-friendly routes with everyday destinations. 3. Increasing the number of complete streets in communities. A complete street is a street that has been designed with all users in mind: vehicles, cyclists and pedestrians. 4. Providing and increasing access to indoor and outdoor spaces for physical activity - away from busy streets, considering age and mobility of individuals. EX: parks and trails, fitness and recreational facilities, schools or universities, malls, senior centers and places of work. 5. Encouraging shared-use agreements to allow public access after hours in order to expand a property's usage. 6. Enhancing physical activity at places of work through support from management, access to facilities, policies and social support programs. 7. Continuous promotion of physical activity through motivation, signage and other resources. 8. Continuous promotion of physical activity and the built environment by the Iowa Department of Public Health and other organizations. Encouraging people to have a less sedentary lifestyle by engaging in regular physical activity continues to be a significant step toward a healthier state and nation. Exercise & Physical Activity Results In 2017, 75.0% adult Iowans reported that they had engaged in some sort of physical activity for exercise during the past month other than their regular job (see Figure 11.1). A larger proportion of younger respondents reported engaging in leisure physical activity than older respondents. The percentage of respondents who exercised also increased with education and household income. This percentage also trended higher for Non-Hispanic Whites than for other racial or ethnic groups, though the difference was not statistically significant. The lowest percentage of all examined demographic variables was among those having less than a high school education (63.5%), while the highest was among those with a college degree (85.2%; see Table 11.1). Figure 11.1: Percentage of Iowans engaging in Leisure-Time Physical Activity in the Past 30 Days by Year, 2011 - 2017Iowa Department of Public Health 2017 BRFSS Annual Report33Exercise and Physical Activity continued The BRFSS determines the level of aerobic physical activity by asking about two activities the person engages in for the most amount of time. These activities are determined as moderate or vigorous based on a complex formula involving several factors including both characteristics of the activity and of the person considering expected maximum oxygen usage. For each activity the frequency of times engaged in for at least ten minutes per week and the total duration of these times is determined. There is also a question asked about activities designed for strengthening the muscles. The recommendation is that people engage in muscle strengthening activity at least twice a week. Just over half of BRFSS respondents met the recommended level of aerobic physical activity in 2017 (50.2%). The percentage of respondents who met the recommended level of strengthening activity was 28.9%. Despite these figures, only 19.2% met both of the recommended levels of aerobic and strengthening activity. The relation of meeting the recommendations for aerobic and strengthening activity differed among the demographic groups. The percentage of respondents reporting they had engaged in the recommended amount of aerobic activity was higher for people with higher income and higher education. The group with the highest percentage meeting the aerobic recommendation were those earning a household income of $75,000 or more (58.4%). The lowest percentage was reported among those who reported a household income of less than $15,000 per year (41.0%). The muscle-strengthening recommendation was met by a higher percentage of younger people, people with more education and those with the highest incomes. The highest percentage was found among those age 18 to 24 years (46.5%). The lowest percentage was found among Iowans with less than a high school education (20.6%).Table 11.1: Percentage Participating in Leisure Exercise in Past Month in Iowa, 2017 Demographic GroupsAny Leisure Physical Exercise in Last Month % C.I.

A larger percentage of those who had more education engaged in the recommended amounts of both types of physical activity. Only those in the highest household income level ($75,000 or more) reported a higher percentage meeting the recommended physical activity levels for both aerobic and muscle-strengthening activity (see Table 11.2).Iowa Department of Public Health 2017 BRFSS Annual Report34Exercise and Physical Activity continued Table 11.2: Percent of Iowans Receiving Recommended Levels of Physical Activity, 2017 Demographic GroupsRecommended Level of Physical Activity Aerobic Strengthening Both Aerobic & Strength % C.I.

Iowa's level of 25.0% is better than this target. The national target to increase the proportion of adults engaging in the recommended amount of regular moderate or regular vigorous aerobic physical activity is 47.9%. Adult Iowans reported 50.2% achieving this recommendation, which meets the national target, but falls short of the Healthy Iowans goal for 52% of adult Iowans to attain the recommended level of aerobic physical activity. The national target for meeting the recommended strengthening goal of two or more times per week is 24.1%. About 28.9% of adult Iowans reported achieving this recommendation, which is better than the national target. On the other hand, Healthy Iowans proposed a target of 32% of adult Iowans meeting the recommended muscle-strengthening goal, which adult Iowans fell short of in 2017. Healthy People 2020 set the target of 20.1% of adults in the United States meeting both of the aerobic physical and muscle-strengthening activity recommendations. Iowa's figure of 19.2% does not meet the national goal. Since the neighborhood environment can have an influence on a person's level of physical activity, a module was asked about the neighborhood environment. In 2017, 72.7% of Iowans rated their neighborhood as a very pleasant place to walk. Sidewalks were reported to be present for 66.8% of respondents. Only 27.6% of respondents used schools for public recreational activity. However, 59.9% of Iowans reported that they used walking trails or parks in their community for recreational activities. Comparison with Other States Values for the prevalence of not engaging in leisure time physical activity ranged from a low of 19.2% to a high of 34.4% among the 50 states and the District of Columbia. Iowa ranked slightly better than the national median for not engaging in leisure time physical activity. Iowa's figure was 25%, while the national median for the nation was 26%. Adult Iowans fared similarly to the nation as a whole on meeting the recommended levels of physical activity. Aerobic physical activity recommendations were met by 41.9% to 59.7% of people in the 50 states and District of Columbia. The national median was 50.6%, while Iowa reported 50.2%. The muscle-strengthening recommendation was met by 22.6% to 35.5% of those in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. The median for the nation was 30.2%, which was higher than the percentage reported by Iowans who met the recommendations for muscle- strengthening (28.9%). References 1.

According to the most recent Dietary Guidelines for Americans (U. S. Department of Health and Human Services & U.S. Department of Agriculture, 2015), a pattern of healthy eating should include vegetables from a variety of subgroups and whole fruits. It is recommended that vegetables be consumed from a variety of different subgroups, including dark green, orange, legumes, starchy vegetables, and other vegetables (U. S. Department of Health and Human Services & U.S. Department of Agriculture, 2015). Increased consumption of fruits and vegetables by individuals is a practical and important means for optimizing nutrition to reduce risk of disease and maximize good health. Eating a diet high in fruits and vegetables can help lower chronic disease risk and aid in weight management. Fruits and vegetables contain essential vitamins, mineral, fiber and other bioactive compounds; a diet high in these foods is associated with lower risk for numerous chronic diseases, including certain cancers, diabetes and cardiovascular diseases (Slavin & Lloyd, 2012). In addition to fruits and vegetables, the Dietary Guidelines recommend consuming a variety of foods in other food groups, but most importantly, whole grains, low-fat or fat- free dairy, protein and oils. People should limit their intake of saturated fats and trans-fats, added sugars, salt and refined or processed foods. The concern is that high-calorie, nutrient-poor sugary foods and beverages are replacing more nutritious foods, adding to the overweight problem. Diet and Nutrition Results The BRFSS asks a series of six questions about how often the respondent eats various fruits or vegetables. From the answers to these questions indices are computed showing the total average consumption per day of fruits and vegetables. The questions involved juice, fruit, beans, dark green vegetables, orange-colored vegetables and other vegetables. Definitions and examples are given concerning what should count in each category. Looking at fruit consumption, 35.6% of adult Iowans reported consuming fruit less than one time per day. For vegetables, 19.3% of adult Iowans reported a consumption pattern of less than one time per day (see Table 12.1). Women, older people, people with more education, and people with higher household incomes tended to eat more fruits and vegetables per day. Adult Iowans age 75 years and older showed the best pattern of consuming fruits each day (24.4% ate less than once). Adult Iowans who were college graduates showed the best pattern of consuming vegetables each day. Approximately 12.2% of adult Iowans who reported their race/ethnicity as a category other than Non-Hispanic White, Non-Hispanic Black or Hispanic indicated consuming vegetables less than once per day. The worst fruit consumption patterns were found among those with lower levels of education and those with a lower reported annual household income. Additionally, males had a low fruit consumption rate, where two out of every five males (40.5%) ate fruit less than once per day. The worst vegetable consumption patterns were found among people with less than a high school education and those earning less than $15,000 household income, where 26.8% and 26.7% ate vegetables less than once per day. Overall, Iowans had better fruit and vegetable consumption in 2017 than in 2015 which is a positive trend. Compared to the figures in 2015, some positive trends for specific groups of adult Iowans reached statistical significance. For fruit, groups that showed better consumption patterns included but were not limited to Non-Hispanic Whites, 35-44 year olds, college graduates and those making a higher annual household income. In 2017 compared to 2015, vegetable consumption was not only better for all Iowans, but also among Non-Hispanic Whites and older adults specifically. In 2017, the survey asked several other questions concerning dietary habits. When asked \"How often do you drink soda or pop containing sugar?\", 40.5% of adult Iowans reported that they did not drink it at all. When asked \"How often do you drink sweetened fruit drinks?\", 54.4% said they did not drink them at all. Concerning sodium or salt, 44.2% of adult Iowans said they were currently watching their salt intake. In addition, 15.6% said that a doctor had advised them to watch their salt intake.

The range of consumption of vegetables was from 76.1% to 87.7% of individuals consuming vegetables at least once per day. Iowa's level of 64.4% for fruit consumption of less than one per day is above the national median of 63.4%, while Iowa's level of 80.7% for vegetable consumption of less than one per day is slightly below the national median consumption rate for vegetables (82.0%). Health Objectives for Iowa Healthy Iowans set the objective for the percentage of Iowans eating five or more fruit and/or vegetables per day at 20%. The figure obtained from Iowa BRFSS of 16.3% falls short of this goal, but is moving in the right direction, up from 2015's figure of 13.5%.

Several respiratory diseases exist that can make breathing difficult. A few common ones are asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Asthma is a chronic, inflammatory disease of the lungs in which the airways become blocked or narrowed causing breathing difficulty. It is characterized by recurrent wheezing, breathlessness, coughing and chest tightness (National Heart Lung and Blood Institute, 2020). This chronic disease affects more than 24.7 million Americans of all ages. Asthma is the most common chronic disease of childhood. About 5.5 million children under the age of 18 (7.5%) suffer from asthma (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2020). Prevalence among adults and children has increased sharply since 1980 (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2011). The causes of asthma are not completely understood, but are most likely a combination of personal and environmental risk factors. Those risk factors for asthma include family history of asthma and allergies, acute respiratory infections, exposure to indoor air pollution (tobacco smoke, animal dander, dust mites, cockroaches, occupational exposures to more than 250 substances), outdoor air pollution (burning leaves, pollen, air pollutants), obesity and lack of exercise. Diet and early exposure to certain infectious agents may provide some protection. After developing asthma, a person often becomes especially sensitive to any exposures to the environmental risk factors listed (National Heart Lung and Blood Institute, 2020). Asthma is a leading cause of inpatient admission and of unscheduled emergency department and physician office visits. Many of these admissions and visits could be avoided if medical and self-management of asthma were carried out according to national guidelines. Self-management of asthma involves the proper use of asthma medications and devices as well as the avoidance of known triggers. People who suffer from asthma are encouraged to develop an asthma management plan. Poor asthma control continues to be associated with increased emergency department visits, hospitalizations and medical costs. The estimated total cost of asthma to society, including medical expenses ($50.3 billion), loss of productivity resulting from missed school or work days ($3 billion per year) and asthma related death ($29 billion) was an estimated $81.9 billion in 2013 (Nurmagambetov, Kuwahara, & Garbe, 2018). Medical expenses associated with asthma were $3,266 per person per year (in 2015 U.S. dollars) during 2008-2013 (Nurmagambetov et al., 2018). Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) includes both chronic bronchitis and emphysema. It is one of the most common lung diseases. Chronic bronchitis is defined by a long-term cough with mucus, while emphysema is defined by destruction of the lungs over time. Most people with COPD have a combination of both conditions (MedlinePlus, 2021). Smoking is the leading cause of COPD. The more a person smokes, the more likely that person will develop COPD. Additional causes are exposure to secondhand smoke or air pollution. There is no cure for COPD. However, there are many things you can do to relieve symptoms and keep the disease from getting worse. Persons with COPD must stop smoking. This is the best way to slow the lung damage. Medications may also be used to treat COPD symptoms. Oxygen therapy at home may be needed if a person has a low level of oxygen in their blood. FACT The causes of asthma are likely a combination of personal and environmental factors, but smoking is the leading cause of COPD.Respiratory Diseases Results In 2017, 13.0% of Iowans reported ever being diagnosed by a physician with asthma. Out of all adult Iowans, 9.3% currently had asthma, and 3.8% formerly had asthma. Current asthma status was reported at the highest rate since 2014, when 8.5% of Iowans currently had asthma (see Figure 13.1).Iowa Department of Public Health 2017 BRFSS Annual Report39Respiratory Conditions continued Table 13.1: Iowans Currently and Formerly Having Asthma, 2017 12 10 8 6 4 2 0Percent 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 8.3 8.1 7.8 8.5 7.6 7.8 9.3 Year PercentFigure 13.1: Current Asthma in Iowa by Year, 2011 - 2017 FACT The current asthma rate for females was almost double the rate for males.In Iowa, more women, people with less than a high school education and people with a lower annual household income currently have asthma. There were no statistical differences in current asthma rates between age groups or racial/ethnic groups examined. The highest current asthma prevalence was among Iowans earning less than $15,000 per year (17.2%), while the lowest prevalence was among those earning a household income of $75,000 per year or more (6.3%; see Table 13.1). When looking at former asthma prevalence rates, the only statistical differences were observed among age categories. Older Iowans (age 55 and older) had lower rates of former asthma than younger Iowans (age 34 and younger).Demographic GroupsCurrent Asthma Former Asthma % (95%) % C.I.

When asked if they had been told they had COPD, 6.4% of BRFSS respondents said they had. This is the highest percentage reported since 2013 when 6.2% of adult Iowans reported ever being told that they had COPD. Women had a higher prevalence than men, but there was not a statistically significant difference between men and women (see Table 13.2). COPD was more common among older people, people with less education and people with a lower household income. Similar to what was observed with current asthma, income plays a role in reported adult COPD. Adult Iowans with a household income of $75,000 per year or more reported the lowest prevalence rate of ever having COPD (2.0%), while those with a household income of less than $15,000 per year had the highest prevalence rate (18.6%). Comparison with Other States In 2017, the prevalence rate of adult Iowans currently suffering from asthma was 9.3%, which was similar to the median rate for the 50 states and the District of Columbia of 9.4%.

Cancer occurs when a group of cells grows out of control and has the ability to take over normal cells (American Cancer Society, 2020). Cancer may arise almost anywhere in the body, though some locations are more common than others. Overall, skin cancer is the most common type of cancer. Among men, prostate cancer is most common, only behind skin cancer. Other common types include lung, breast and colorectal cancer. Though cancer is a common disease, more and more people are surviving cancer. The American Cancer Society predicted that in 2017 there would be an estimated 1,688,780 new cancer cases diagnosed and 600,920 cancer deaths in the U.S. (American Cancer Society, 2017). Despite this, death rates for all cancer types have declined since 1991 when the cancer death rate peaked at 215 deaths from cancer per 100,000 people by about 27% in 2016 (156 cancer deaths per 100,000 people). Progress towards lowering the death rate for those who are diagnosed with cancer is largely contributed to by reductions in smoking as well as vast improvements in early cancer detection and treatment methods. The decline in cancer death rates over the last 2 decades have resulted in over 2.6 million fewer deaths from cancer from 1991 to 2016 (American Cancer Society, 2019). Reductions in smoking and improvements in early cancer detection and treatment methods are helping to lower the cancer death rate.FACT Skin and Other Cancer Screening Results In 2017, 6.8% of adult Iowans had ever been told they had skin cancer, which was an increase from the rate reported in 2016 (5.6%) and the highest reported rate over the last six years. In 2017, 7.2% reported having been told they had some other type of cancer, a prevalence rate that slightly increased over the past year (7.1% in 2016). Skin cancer behaves somewhat differently from other types of cancers, which themselves may vary in prevalence and prognosis according to type. The prevalence rate of skin cancer was similar among males and females. Other cancers were more common among females. In general, the prevalence rate for having skin cancer or other cancers increased with age. The highest prevalence of ever having skin or other cancer was among Iowans who were aged 75 years and older (23.4% for skin cancer and 20.8% for other cancer (see Table 14.1).Iowa Department of Public Health 2017 BRFSS Annual Report42Other Cancer Prevalence continued Table 14.1: Prevalence of Iowans Reporting ever Having Cancer, 2017References 1.

An estimated 34 million or 14% of all American adults currently smoke cigarettes (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2020). Tobacco use is known to cause heart disease, stroke, peripheral vascular disease, respiratory diseases such as COPD and asthma attacks, as well as cancers of the lung, larynx, esophagus, pharynx, mouth, bladder, pancreas, kidney and cervix. In fact, smoking causes diseases in nearly every organ of the body (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2020). Consequences of smoking during pregnancy include spontaneous abortions, low birth weight babies and sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Secondhand smoke (SHS) increases the risk of heart disease and lung cancer in adults. SHS also affects children by increasing lower respiratory tract infections and asthma, and by decreasing pulmonary function. According to the Surgeon General, there is no safe level of exposure to secondhand smoke (U. S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2014). Many steps are being taken to prevent use of tobacco. Some of these include reducing exposure to environmental tobacco smoke, smoking prevention education, the restriction of minors' access to tobacco, the treatment of nicotine addiction (cessation), and working toward changing social norms and environments that support tobacco use. Efforts to shift social norms surrounding smoking include counter-advertising and promotion, product regulation and economic incentives against tobacco. In Iowa, smoking cessation programs such as Quitline Iowa offer free nicotine replacement therapy (NRT). Tobacco Results Current smoking is defined as smoking at least 100 cigarettes in a lifetime and smoking every day or some days during the past 30 days. Among adult Iowans in 2017, 17.1% reported being a current smoker, which was a change from the 2016 current smoking rate of 16.7% (see Figure 15.1). In 2017, the proportion of current smokers was higher among males than females, as well as higher for Iowans with less than high school education and among Non-Hispanic Blacks. Smoking declined after age 65, but was also lower for people age 18 to 24 than among older age groups. Respondents with annual household incomes of less than $15,000 reported the highest proportion of current smokers at 31.6% (see table 15.1).

This means that they had smoked at least 100 cigarettes in their lifetime, but do not smoke now. More males than females were former smokers and the percent of former smokers tended to increase with age. The 18 to 24-year age group had only 5.2% former smokers, while those 65 and older had over 38.7% (see Figure 15.2). Non-Hispanic Blacks reported a significantly lower percentage of former smokers than other racial/ethnic groups. When asked how long it had been since they last smoked cigarettes regularly, the majority of former smokers (58.6%) said 10 or more years. When asked about attempts to quit smoking, over half (52.7%) of current smokers reported they quit smoking for a day or more during the past year. Quit attempts were higher among younger smokers, Iowans with less than high school education and those with household incomes under $35,000. Iowans with the highest education and incomes reported lower rates of quit attempts. To assess use of other tobacco products besides cigarettes, all respondents were asked if they currently use chewing tobacco, snuff or snus. About 5.5% said they used either chewing tobacco, snuff or snus every day or some days. When asked whether they had tried hookah, even one or two puffs, 14.5% of Iowans in 2017 said they had tried smoking a hookah. Other tobacco products used every day or some days by Iowans were cigars (1.7%) and a pipe (0.8%). In 2017, 19.4% of Iowans said they had ever used an e-cigarette or other electronic vaping products, with 4.0% currently using e-cigarettes every day or some days. Use of e-cigarettes was particularly common among males, young adult Iowans and those with annual household incomes under $25,000 (see Table 15.2). Of smokers who had seen a doctor in the past year, 69.1% of them reported that the doctor had advised them to quit smoking. The most common forms of assistance offered by doctors were medical resources (24.4%) or a quitline (25.0%). Of smokers who had seen a dentist in the past year, 39.6% reported that the dentist had advised them to quit smoking. With respect to rules against smoking in their house, 85.4% of Iowans said they never allowed it.Cigarette smoking is the leading cause of preventable disease and death in the United States, accounting for more than 480,000, or every 1 in 5, deaths every year.FACT20 18 16 14 12 10 8 6 4 2 0Percent 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 18.1 19.5 18.5 18.1 16.7 17.1 Year PercentFigure 15.2: Percentage of Current and Former 18-24 25-34 35-44 45-54 55-64 65-74 75+ Current Smoker Former Smoker50 45 40 35 30 25 20 15 10 5 0Percent Age GroupIowa Department of Public Health 2017 BRFSS Annual Report45Tobacco continued Table 15.2: Percentage of E-Cigarette users in Iowa, 2017 Demographic Groups Prevalence Rate (%) C.I.

Iowa's current smoking rate was the same as the national median among all states. Regionally, the Midwest had the highest smoking rate, with 17 out of every 100 adults (16.9%) being current smokers (Centers for Disease Control, Smoking and Tobacco Use, 2019). Health Objectives for Iowa and the nation As a nation, smoking rates continue to decline, with the national mean rate in 2017 being 14%. However, with 34 million adult Americans still currently smoking, the Healthy People 2020 goal to reduce the percentage of smokers to 12% has still not been achieved. As a state, the current smoking prevalence of 17.1% in Iowa is still above both the Healthy People 2020 target and the Healthy Iowans goal of reducing the state cigarette smoking rate to 15%. The Healthy People 2020 goal of having 80% of current smokers attempting to quit in the past year was not met by Iowan adults. Nearly 30 percentage points below the goal, Iowa had a rate of 52.7% of current smokers attempting to quit in the past year. Current smoking has declined from nearly 21 out of every 100 adults in 2005 to 14 out of every 100 adults in 2017.FACTReferences 1. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. (2020).

Iowa Department of Public Health 2017 BRFSS Annual Report46Alcohol Consumption 59.7% of Iowans reported that they had at least one drink of alcohol in the past 30 days.FACT Background The National Institute of Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) defines binge drinking as a pattern of drinking that brings a person's blood alcohol concentration (BAC) to 0.08 grams percent or above. This typically happens when men consume five or more drinks or women consume four or more drinks in about two hours (NIAAA, 2021). The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) defines binge drinking as five or more alcoholic drinks for males or four or more alcoholic drinks for females on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least one day in the past month (NIAAA, 2021). Heavy drinking is defined as heavy alcohol use on five or more days in the past month. Alcohol dependency and abuse are major public health problems carrying a large economic cost and placing heavy demands on the health care system. Chronic alcohol use affects every organ and system of the body. It can lead to medical disorders (e.g., fetal alcohol syndrome, liver disease, cardiomyopathy and pancreatitis). Heavy drinking can increase the risk for certain cancers. Drinking lowers inhibitory control and disrupts decision-making abilities, rational thought and attention, and increases the risk of death from automobile crashes, as well as recreational and on-the-job injuries (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2018; American Addition Centers, 2020). Alcohol Consumption Results The BRFSS survey defines a standard drink as one 12-ounce beer, one 5-ounce glass of wine, or a drink with one shot of hard liquor. In 2017, 59.7% of Iowans reported that they had at least one drink of alcohol in the past 30 days. On the days when they drank, 37.1% had an average of only one drink. About 11.9% reported drinking five or more drinks per day on average.Table 16.1: Binge Drinking and Heavy Drinking among Iowa adults, 2017 Demographic GroupsBinge Drinking Heavy Drinking Prevalence Rate (%)C.I.

According to this definition, 7.2% of all Iowans were heavy drinkers. The trend has been steadily increasing over the last few years, with 2017 prevalence rates being higher than 2015, when 5.9% of Iowans were heavy drinkers (see Figure 16.1). Heavy drinking among men is significantly higher than in women. In 2017, 8.8% of men were considered to be heavy drinkers, while 5.7% of women reported being heavy drinkers. In Iowa, older people, those with less than a high school education, and people with household incomes between $25,000 and $34,999 reported a lower prevalence of heavy drinking (see Table 16.1). Among adult Iowans, 12.3% reported at least one binge drinking episode in the 30 days prior to participating in the survey. More than twice as many males binge drink than females, at 27.6% and 14.8% respectively. Men binged more than women at all ages, with the prevalence of binge drinking decreasing with age from 42.5% among 25 to 34 year olds to 4.8% among those 75 years old and older (see Figure 16.2). In 2017, a higher percentage of Hispanic and Non-Hispanic Whites binged than all other racial and ethnic groups. Iowans with some college or college graduates and those with higher incomes tended to report a higher prevalence of binge drinking (see Table 16.1). Figure 16.2: Binge Drinking Among Iowa adults by Age and Sex, 2017 Comparison with Other States The prevalence of people reporting heavy drinking in the 50 states and District of Columbia ranged from 3.6% to 9.5%. Iowa's rate of 7.2% is above the national median of 6.3%. The national median level of reported binge drinking was 17.4% and ranged from 11.5% to 25.6% across all 50 states and the District of Columbia. Iowa's rate of 21.1% was well above the national median. There were only three states (District of Columbia, North Dakota and Wisconsin) with a higher prevalence than Iowa of reported binge drinking in 2017.

Iowa Department of Public Health 2017 BRFSS Annual Report48Disability and Arthritis Background The World Health Organization's International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (2001) defines disability as an umbrella term for impairments, activity limitations and participation restrictions. Disability is the interaction between individuals with a health condition (e.g. cerebral palsy, Down's syndrome, or depression) and personal and environmental factors (e.g. negative attitudes, inaccessible transportation and public buildings, and limited social supports). Impairment is defined as \"any loss or abnormality of psychological, physiological, or anatomical structure or function\" (World Health Organization, 2001). Chronic physical, mental and emotional conditions can limit the ability of adults to carry out important activities such as working and doing everyday household chores. According to data from the 2016 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, one in four people in the United States has a disability (26%; 61 million people) that prevented or limited their ability in some way (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2020). The number of people living with a disability is on the rise, in part by the aging population and an increase in chronic health conditions around the world. Currently, if services for those with a disability are available, they tend to lack the necessary resources and quality required to provide adequate care and relief. There is a need to increase disability services in primary healthcare settings, and more specifically in rehabilitation interventions. (World Health Organization, 2020). Having a disability is not necessarily a barrier to good general health in unrelated areas. Many disabled Americans use Assistive Technology Devices (ATDs) to accommodate mobility impairments and other sensory and mental impairments. These can allow a person with a disability to work and otherwise live an independent life. Disability Results The most recent standard of determining disability in adult Iowans requires a \"yes\" response to at least one of the following six items. In 2017, 6.7% of Iowans reported that they were deaf or had trouble hearing; 3.0% reported that they were blind; 9.6% reported that they had serious difficulty concentrating, remembering, or making decisions; 12.0% reported that they had serious difficulty walking or climbing stairs; 3.5% reported that they had difficulty dressing or bathing; 6.3% reported that they had difficulty doing errands alone such as visiting a doctor's office or shopping because of a physical, mental, or emotional condition. Using the answers to these questions, the \"new\" method for determining disability produced a rate of 24.5%, which was higher than what was reported in 2016 (22.7%; see Figure 17.1). Figure 17.1: Adults with Disability in Iowa Trend, 2016-2017 New Method Table 17.1 shows the results of the most recent disability determination method. Older people, people with less education and people with lower household incomes reported higher percentages of disability. Many disabled people are unable to work due to their disability. Over half of those who reported disability had incomes of less than $15,000 (56.3%). The lowest prevalence rate of disability was reported among those with an annual household income of $75,000 or more (11.7%). Arthritis is the leading cause of work disability in the United States. Arthritis is the name given to a group of over 100 different rheumatic diseases and conditions that result in pain and reduction of functionality in and around the joints. The most common are osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, fibromyalgia, and gout (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2020). Arthritis may be caused by a wearing down of cartilage, a change in bone composition, or inflammation in the joints. Over 54 million adults in the United States have arthritis (23%; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2020).30 25 20 15 10 5 0 2016 2017 22.7 24.5 Year Percent DisabledIowa Department of Public Health 2017 BRFSS Annual Report49Disability and Arthritis continued Table 17.1: Percent Reporting Being Disabled, 2017 Table 17.2: Percent Having Been Told by a Doctor They Had Some Form of Arthritis, 2017 Not all people diagnosed with arthritis find it to be a disability. FACTIn 2017, a doctor had told 24.7% of Iowans that they had some form of arthritis. Rates of reported arthritis have continued to decline (see Figure 17.2). The percentage of adult Iowans reporting arthritis is higher than the percentage reporting disability indicating not all people diagnosed with arthritis find it to be a limitation.A statistically higher percentage of women than men reported having arthritis. The prevalence decreased with greater education and income. In general, fewer racial and ethnic minorities reported having arthritis than Non- Hispanic Whites. Age had the strongest association. The demographic group reporting the highest prevalence of arthritis was adult Iowans age 75 years and older (51.9%). The group with the lowest prevalence was people age 18 to 24 years old (4.2%), which has continued to rise over the last few years. For example, only 1.4% of 18-24 year olds reported having arthritis in 2015 and 1.5% of this age group reported having arthritis in 2016.Demographic GroupsPrevelance Rate (%)C.I.

Iowa was slightly better than the median at 24.7%Iowa Department of Public Health 2017 BRFSS Annual Report51Immunizations Background Influenza, or the flu, is a contagious respiratory illness caused by viruses that infect the nose, throat and lungs. It can cause mild to severe illness, and at times can lead to death. The best way to prevent the flu is by getting a flu vaccination each year (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2021). Influenza can vary greatly from year to year in the severity of its impact. For instance, the seasonal influenza primarily causes more of a problem for the elderly, while the 2009 H1N1 pandemic affected more children, young and middle-aged adults (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2019). For healthy children and adults, influenza is typically a moderately severe illness. For unhealthy or elderly people, influenza can be very dangerous. Adults 65 years old and older who contract influenza are much more likely to have serious complications from this illness, which can affect their health and independence. Influenza can be prevented with the influenza vaccine. This vaccine is produced each year so that it can be effective against influenza viruses that are expected to cause illness that year. A yearly influenza vaccination has been reported to lower the chances of individuals needing to go to the doc - tor for the flu by 40.0% to 60.0%. The vaccine may be taken through several methods, but the most common is a shot in the upper arm muscle. The best time to receive the influenza vaccine is soon after the vaccine becomes available in the fall of each year. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (2020) recommends that people get vaccinated by the end of October of each year, but one can continue receiving the vaccine into January or later of the following year. The recommendation by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is for everyone in the U.S. from six months of age and older to get the seasonal influenza vaccine. There are different vaccine options, and one should consult a doctor or healthcare professional for the most appropriate one based on health status and age (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2020). Influenza is a very serious illness for anyone at high risk. Certain diseases that place people at high risk include: Chronic lung disease such as asthma, emphysema, chronic bronchitis, tuberculosis or cystic fibrosis, Heart disease, Diabetes or other chronic metabolic disorders, Severe anemia, Chronic kidney disease or Diseases or treatments that depress immunity. Some of the symptoms associated with influenza are fever, chills, coughing, weakness, muscle aches and pains, sore throat or headache (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2020). Pneumonia is a lung disease caused by bacteria, viruses, and other infectious agents such as fungi. Pneumonia is frequently a complication of influenza and is responsible for the vast majority of deaths from the two. In 2017, three million people in the United States were diagnosed with pneumonia in an emergency department, and around 50,000 people died from the disease (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2020). In 2017, influenza and pneumonia combined were the eighth leading cause of death among all Americans as well as those specifically aged 65 and older (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2020). Influenza and pneumonia together resulted in 578 deaths in Iowa in 2017 (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2021). The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends that persons aged 65 years old or older receive the pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine at least once in their lifetime. A second vaccine (pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, typically first administered when children are younger than 2 years of age) is now also recommended to follow the first for added protection, but people should consult with their doctor or healthcare provider for which combination is best based on age, previous vaccinations, and health status (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2020). People at an increased risk for pneumococcal disease are those with chronic illnesses, such as diseases of the heart, liver, kidney or lung as well as diabetes and alcoholism, those with conditions that result in weakened immune system, such as HIV/AIDS and cancer, those with cochlear implants or cerebrospinal fluid leaks and those who engage in cigarette smoking (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2020).

This was the lowest reported percentage since 2011 (see Figure 18.1). Among all adults, 45.8% had a flu immunization in the past 12 months, which is a decrease from the percentage reported in 2016 (46.6%). Females, older people, those with more education and people with higher household incomes reported higher prevalence rates of having a flu immunization in the past year. In 2017, the lowest percentage was reported among 18-24 year olds (33.0%), which was a decline from 2016 for this age group (36.7%). The highest prevalence rate was reported among those age 75 and older (71.6%; see Table 18.1). In 2017, 80.3% of Iowans age 65 and over reported ever having a pneumonia vaccination. This is the highest reported prevalence to date, and continues the upward trend observed since 2015 (see Figure 18.1). Among all adults, 40.7% had ever received a pneumonia vaccination, which was a higher reported figure than in 2016 when 34.6% had. Older people reported the highest rates of having a vaccination in their lifetime (85.7% for 75+ year olds; see Table 18.1). The prevalence rate for 18-24 year olds ever receiving the pneumonia vaccination increased significantly from 31.5% in 2016 to 41.7% in 2017. Middle- aged adult Iowans reported the lowest prevalence rates of receiving a pneumonia vaccination. Since vaccination is only recommended for those age 65 years and older except under special conditions (those of younger ages who are at high risk for pneumonia), this finding is consistent with current vaccination recommendations. Rates for ever receiving a pneumonia vaccination were similar between males and females. Iowa Department of Public Health 2017 BRFSS Annual Report53Immunizations continued Table 18.1: Percentage of Influenza and Pneumonia Immunizations in Adult Iowans, 2017 Adult Iowans who reported a lower household income had higher rates of ever receiving the pneumonia vaccine than those in the higher household income categories. For example, 30.1% of people with a household income of $75,000 or more had ever received the pneumonia vaccine, while just over half (51.5%) of those with a household income of less than $15,000 had received the vaccine before. The relation with education and income is the opposite of most health risk measures, though is a similar trend as what was observed in recent years of Iowa BRFSS data. In 2017, results were mixed regarding the relationship between chronic conditions that could increase the risk of getting the flu or pneumonia and receiving the respective vaccinations. Of all respondents ever told they had diabetes, asthma, COPD, or kidney disease; 54.4% had a flu vaccination in the past 12 months, compared to 45.6% who had a chronic condition and had not received a flu vaccination. Of respondents ever told that they had one or more of the chronic health conditions above, a higher percentage had received a pneumonia vaccine in their lifetime (60.9%) than those with at least one chronic condition without a history of a pneumonia vaccine (39.1%). This difference was significant, resulting in a higher percentage of people with chronic condition(s) receiving the pneumonia vaccine, which is in line with what the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends, in terms of people most at risk for pneumonia. Comparison with Other States The median percentage of the population age 65 and over who have had a flu shot in the past 12 months from all the states and the District of Columbia was 60.6% in 2017. The range was from 52.0% to 68.5%. The prevalence in Iowa was 66.3%, which was higher than the national median. Though flu vaccination rates among Iowans 65 years or older have declined over the past few years, Iowa was the fifth highest state for flu vaccination prevalence among this age group in 2017.

The rates of flu and pneumonia vaccinations for Iowans are above the national medians, but still fall short of national and state targets.FACT The national median percentage of the population age 65 years old and older who ever had a pneumonia vaccination was 75.4%. The range across the 50 states and the District of Columbia was from 68.4% to 78.3%. Iowa's rate for adults 65 years of age or older (80.3%) was above the national median. Iowa was among the top states for those 65 years or older ever receiving the pneumonia vaccination. Oklahoma and Iowa tied for having the sixth highest vaccination rate among the 50 states and the District of Columbia. Health Objectives for Iowa and the Nation The Healthy People 2020 and Healthy Iowans goals for having a flu shot in the past 12 months and ever having a pneumonia vaccination for people age 65 and over are both 90%. Although higher than the nation as a whole, Iowa's 2017 rates of 66.3% for having a flu vaccination and 80.3% for ever having a pneumonia vaccination are a long way from meeting these targets. The Healthy People 2020 goal for flu immunization of people age 18 to 64 is 80%. Iowa misses this by an even greater amount having a flu immunization prevalence rate of only 39.9% among this age group. The rate among younger Iowans was 41.1% in 2016, so the rate of flu vaccinations for younger adults in Iowa is moving in the opposite direction from the goal. Iowa Department of Public Health 2017 BRFSS Annual Report55HIV/AIDS Background HIV stands for human immunodeficiency virus. This is the virus that causes acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). HIV is different from most other viruses because it attacks the immune system. The immune system gives our bodies the ability to fight infections. HIV finds and destroys a type of white blood cell that the immune system must have to fight disease. AIDS is the final stage of HIV infection. It can take years for a person infected with HIV, even without treatment, to reach this stage. Having AIDS means that the virus has weakened the immune system to the point at which the body has a difficult time fighting infections (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2020). June 2017 marked the 36th year of experiencing the HIV epidemic (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2011). In 2017, 36.82 million people were living with HIV infection worldwide, with 1.49 million cases being among those in the United States (Global Burden of Disease Collaborative Network, 2018). About one in seven (14%) people are living with HIV but do not know they are infected (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2021). Not knowing puts them and others at risk. In 2017, an estimated 37,000 people were diagnosed with HIV infection in the United States (Global Burden of Disease Collaborative Network, 2018).. The number of new HIV diagnoses has decreased from 37,800 in 2015 (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2021). Because HIV testing has remained stable or increased in recent years, this decrease in new diagnoses suggests a positive response and true decline in new infections. The decrease may be due to targeted HIV prevention efforts. This being said, progress has been experienced unevenly, and diagnoses have increased among a few groups (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2020; U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2021). Data suggests that HIV prevention and treatment are not sufficiently reaching the populations that could most benefit from them. Groups with the largest exposure include \"men who have sex with men (MSM)\", African Americans, Hispanics, transgender persons, injection drug users, and those who reside in the South. Data must be utilized to ensure targeted prevention efforts to reach those in greatest need, with a primary focus on young African American and Hispanic men who identify as gay or bisexual, MSM, heterosexual persons, and those who inject drugs (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2021). African American and Hispanic men continue to be over-represented among persons with HIV diagnoses when compared to the sizes of their populations in Iowa. For example, even though Non-Hispanic Blacks represent 3% of Iowa's population, they experienced 30% of the diagnoses in 2017; Hispanics represent 6% of the state's population, but experienced a 13% rate of HIV diagnoses in 2017 (Iowa Department of Public Health, 2020). The highest prevalence rate ever recorded was in 2016 when 136 new Iowans were diagnosed with HIV/AIDS. Since 2016, there was a decrease in HIV/AIDS prevalence in Iowa. As of December 31, 2017, there were 2,790 persons living with HIV or AIDS who were Iowa residents at the time of their diagnosis. There were 125 new diagnoses during 2017, which is a lower number of new diagnoses than in 2016 (Iowa Department of Public Health, 2020). The lifetime costs of health care associated with HIV have grown considerably. Currently, the lifetime treatment cost of a single HIV infection is estimated at $379,668 in 2010 dollars (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2019). The CDC recommends routine HIV testing in health care settings. People should get tested so they can receive treatment and not infect others. By being tested, people can become aware of their status and if diagnosed, can start receiving treatment and still remain healthy for many years down the road. If it is a negative diagnosis, individuals can further make decisions regarding sex, the use of drugs and health care regarding protection from getting HIV (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2020). Treatment for HIV is better than ever before. Getting routinely tested for HIV is recommended by the CDC.FACTIowa Department of Public Health 2017 BRFSS Annual Report56 HIV/AIDS HIV/AIDS Results In 2017, 27.8% of all adult Iowans reported ever being tested for HIV, not including part of a blood donation. The rate for 2017 was the highest rate reported in Iowa over the last seven years (see Figure 19.1). Females, those of minority race/ethnicity, adults between 25 and 44 years of age, and those with lower household incomes reported having been tested at higher rates. The largest proportion of respondents tested was among Non-Hispanic Blacks (55.6%). The smallest proportion reporting ever being tested were those age 75 years and older (4.8%; see Table 19.1). Compared to the rates by demographic groups in 2016, college graduates were the only group that reported an increase in being tested for HIV (27.2% in 2016 vs. 32.1% in 2017). Figure 19.2 shows that in younger people, many more women report ever being tested, but for adults age 55 and older, testing rates for males slightly surpass those of females.

Mental health includes our emotional, psychological and social well-being. It affects how we think, feel, and act. It also helps determine how we handle stress, relate to others, and make healthy choices (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2018). Mental illness refers to conditions that affect a person's thinking, feeling, mood or behavior, such as depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, or schizophrenia (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2018). Physical health and mental health are inter-dependent. Poor physical health can lead to poor mental health, and poor mental health can lead to poor physical health. For example, mental illness, particularly depression, puts individuals at a higher risk for physical health problems such as stroke, type 2 diabetes and heart disease. Likewise, individuals who have chronic physical health conditions are at a higher risk for mental illness (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2018). In 2017, an estimated 8.5 million adults aged 18 or older (3.4% of all adults) had any mental illness and at least one substance use disorder in the past year. About 3.1 million adults (1.3% of all adults) had co-occurring severe mental illness and an substance use disorder in the past year (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, 2018). Mental health and mental disorders have a significant impact on the total health-care system. In 2016, there were over 56.7 million visits to physician offices in which mental, behavioral or neurodevelopmental disorders were the primary diagnosis (Rui & Okeyode, 2019). The impact of mental illness is large. Mood disorders that include major depression, dysthymic disorder and bipolar disorder are the 3rd leading cause of hospitalization for U.S. adults aged 18- 44. One out of every 25 U.S. adults has a condition called serious mental illness (SMI), in which individuals experience a mental illness or disorder in the past year \"with serious functional impairment that substantially interferes with or limits one or more major life activities\". Individuals living with SMI are at a higher risk for developing physical health problems like heart disease, diabetes, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and have a shorter lifespan than others (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2018). Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are stressful or traumatic events that occur in childhood (0-17 years), including abuse and neglect. They may also include household dysfunction such as witnessing domestic violence or growing up with family members who have substance use disorders (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2019). Experiences people have in early childhood can have a lifelong effect on both physical and mental health. A look at these experiences can help to focus on people likely to need special attention (Anda & Felitti, 2014), but more research is needed to determine if and how the potential benefits of screening for ACEs outweigh the potential harms (Afifi & Asmundson, 2020; McLennan, McTavish, & MacMillan, 2020). Research has demonstrated a strong relationship between adverse childhood experiences, substance use disorders and behavioral problems. When children are exposed to chronic stressful events, their neurodevelopment can be disrupted. As a result, the child's cognitive functioning or ability to cope with negative or disruptive emotions may be impaired. Over time, and often during adolescence, the child may adopt negative coping mechanisms, such as substance use or self-harm. Eventually, these unhealthy coping mechanisms can contribute to disease, disability, and social problems, as well as premature mortality. Mental Health and Adverse Childhood Experiences Results In 2017, 20.5% of adults reported that they had been told within their lifetime that they had a depressive disorder, including depression, major depression, dysthymia or minor depression about various chronic conditions. This is the highest rate reported by adult Iowans to date (see Figure 20.1). Iowa Department of Public Health 2017 BRFSS Annual Report59Mental Health & Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) continued Figure 20.1: Iowans Ever told they had Depression by Year, 2012 - 2017Table 20.1: Prevalence of Depression in Iowa Adults, 2017 21 18 15 12 9 6 3 0 Percent 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 17.0 19.2 18.7 19.0 14.8 20.5 Year Percent Adult women in Iowa reported experiencing depression at almost double the rate of men in 2017. Rates of reported depression were higher among lower income individuals and lower among older Iowans. The highest prevalence was reported among those with annual household incomes of less than $15,000 (42.3%). The lowest prevalence was reported among those age 75 years or older (10.1%; see Table 20.1). In 2017, BRFSS contained questions that explore the early childhood experiences of respondents. Respondents were asked to recall experiences they had before they were 18 years old specifically surrounding childhood abuse and neglect as well as household dysfunction. This data is then used to assess the impact of these childhood experiences on health and well-being in adult years. Questions used in the BRFSS are adapted from the CDC-Kaiser Permanente ACE study conducted from 1995 to 1997. An adverse childhood experiences module was assessed in 2017. Rather than look at each question individually from this module, a single score will be determined based on all of the responses to the 11 questions. Iowans provided responses on a wide range of childhood experiences such as exposure to divorced, incarcerated, or drug abusing parents and physical, psychological or sexual abuse. The ACEs module contained 11 questions. For Iowans, 40.5% indicated no adverse childhood experiences, 21.8% indicated one, 20.5% indicated two or three, 9.4% indicated four or five, and 7.8% indicated six or more. This corresponds to about 144,174 adult Iowans with six or more ACEs, which was a small increase (0.8%) from 2016. Table 20.2 shows that depression, frequent mental distress and days of bad physical health were more prevalent among Iowans who reported 2 or more adverse childhood experiences (ACEs). Iowans who reported experiencing one ACE also reported being told they had a depressive disorder as well as had a higher prevalence of frequent mental distress than Iowans who reported experiencing zero ACEs. In general, as the number of reported ACEs increased, so did the prevalence rate of frequent mental distress and number of bad physical health days, but Demographic GroupsDepressive Disorder % C.I.
