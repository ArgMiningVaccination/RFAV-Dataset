Learn how to get more of it with these expert tips. 6 min read While a walk through a pharmacy's supplement aisle may leave you feeling like there are dozens of vitamins your body needs to survive, there are just 13 essential vitamins. And although our bodies' needs for many of these core nutrients can be met through diet alone, there is one vitamin many people are deficient in due to a lack of it occurring in many foods: vitamin D. To help better understand what vitamin D is and how to get more of it, we turned to [Eric Ascher, DO](https://www.northwell.edu/find-care/find-a-doctor/family-medicine/dr-eric-michael-ascher-do-11379678), a family medicine doctor at Northwell Health. \"Vitamin D helps regulate your bone structure and strength,\" explains Ascher. The connection to bones is why you often see vitamin D in ingredients traditionally viewed as being excellent sources of calcium. \"That is because vitamin D helps the body absorb calcium.\" In addition to bone strength, he points out that [vitamin D also promotes muscle strength, function, and regeneration](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2901845/), and, according to some experimental research, may even decrease your risk of developing cancer. \"Vitamin D also helps boost energy levels, and it strengthens your immune system,\" he adds. \"In some studies [vitamin D has even been linked to your mood and cited as a way to help prevent depression](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6970300/),\" says Ascher. By providing your email address, you agree to receive email communication from The Well. The simple fact is that many people's vitamin D levels are too low, with research finding that as many as [42% of all U.S. adults are deficient in the vitamin](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21310306/). \"For reference, 'normal' vitamin D levels range between 30 and 80 units,\" explains Ascher. \"But I encourage my patients to aim for between 40 and 60 units.\" However, he says that without a lab measurement, it's hard to know if you are getting enough. If your levels are low, Ascher says there may be noticeable signs you could be dealing with a vitamin D deficiency. \"If patients have fragile bones, i.e., a bone breaks in a way we wouldn't predict in someone young, we would assess vitamin D levels. Likewise, if patients come in and mention they are fatigued, it would also be a sign to assess vitamin D.\" However, he says, the easiest way to keep tabs on your vitamin D levels is by having it included in your yearly bloodwork panel. \"I test this annually in my office as part of the annual physical,\" says Ascher, who suggests asking your provider to do the same if they aren't already. \"If the value is low or borderline low, I always suggest a vitamin D-rich diet if applicable, as well as a daily or weekly supplement depending on the level.\" Still, the fact is that some people are more susceptible to having lower levels of vitamin D. This includes: If any of these apply to you, speak to your doctor about adding vitamin D screenings to your yearly bloodwork panel. For some, sunlight exposure can represent a quick, simple way to get vitamin D without taking a supplement or dietary changes. Ascher says to aim for roughly 8 to 10 minutes per day around midday, when the sun is at its highest, and to ensure that at least 25% of your body is exposed to the sun, and says to always apply [sunscreen](https://thewell.northwell.edu/dear-doctor/mineral-sunscreen-kids). In the New York area he suggests this is easiest during the early fall, mid-spring, and summer when your face, neck, arms, and hands are exposed. However, he acknowledges that this is tricky for busy people who work during daylight hours, or regularly cover their arms and necks. \"If you can escape the office before or after midday, or you do have to wear more clothing during working hours, you may want to stay out closer to 15 minutes,\" he says. Still, Ascher adds that because sun exposure can lead to dangerous sunburns or skin cancer, he prefers patients not rely on the sun for vitamin D and recommends they manage their levels through diet and supplements instead. Depending on your dietary needs and preferences, you can get most, if not all, of your daily vitamin D from your food consumption, whether that be through natural or fortified sources. \"For example, eggs and fatty fish like salmon have vitamin D,\" says Ascher. The only hitch here, he says, is that these ingredients may also be high in things like cholesterol, making supplements a better option for those with high cholesterol and other health concerns. Further, since the vitamin doesn't occur naturally in most ingredients, many foods are fortified with vitamin D instead. These include dairy products like milk, milk alternatives, and orange juice. Likewise, many cereals are also commonly fortified with vitamin D. However, as is the case with high-cholesterol sources of vitamin D, if you are monitoring sugar or carbs due to [diabetes](https://thewell.northwell.edu/chronic-diseases-conditions/diabetes-warning-signs) or [prediabetes](https://thewell.northwell.edu/chronic-diseases-conditions/can-you-reverse-prediabetes), you may want to limit your cereal or juice intake due to the likelihood for increased sugar content. Still, he says there are some non-fat, non-sugar, naturally occurring sources of vitamin D available for those looking to bolster their levels through their diet. For one, mushrooms provide an excellent source of vitamin D that you can actually feel good about eating. For those who are vitamin D deficient and don't want to rely on diet or sun exposure alone to bolster their levels, a supplement might seem like an excellent solution\u2014and Ascher agrees. \"If your blood test reveals your levels are below 15, I recommend a weekly supplement,\" he says. For a level that low, he recommends a high dose to be taken once per week, in the morning on the same day each week. Otherwise, a once-daily supplement is encouraged, however you should consult with your doctor to determine what dose and cadence is best for you. At the end of the day, no matter whether you get your vitamin D from the sun, your food, or a supplement, Ascher stresses that it all has the same value to your body's systems. Keeping yourself healthy by having enough vitamin D will improve your quality of life, from your bone health to your mood. The Well is Northwell Health's commitment to the future of health care.
