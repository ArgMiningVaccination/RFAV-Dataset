Want to figure out more effective ways to study your company's financial statements? If so, look no further than the common size balance sheet. This powerful tool displays financial data as a percentage, making it easier to spot trends and changes over time. This blog explores the advantages and disadvantages of using a common size balance sheet and provides insights into how to utilize it efficiently for financial analysis. What is a Common Size Balance Sheet? A common size balance sheet is a financial statement that displays each balance sheet item as a percentage of total assets. As a result, it becomes easier to compare companies of various sizes and track changes within a company over time. To generate a common size balance sheet, divide each asset and liability by total assets and multiply by 100 to get the percentage. For example: If Company A has $1,000 in cash and $5,000 in total assets, this would be presented in a separate column as 20%. Line items in income statements are frequently divided by total revenues or total sales. If Company A has $2,000 in operating expenses and $4,000 in total revenues, the operating expenses are 50%. This produces a standardized view of the balance sheet that emphasizes the relative size of each item and the balance sheet's overall structure. Commonsize balance sheets are more useful than traditional ones in identifying trends and patterns in a company's financial performance. They provide a more detailed picture of the company's financial health. As a result, they can also be used to compare companies in the same industry and benchmark against industry averages.
