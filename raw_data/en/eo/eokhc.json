Matter, love, and humans are all energy. Although countless people deal with anxiety, depression, and panic attacks, many don't turn to energy medicine as their first treatment. We automatically look for the 'quick fix'. If there's a magical pill, such as Advil, that provides instant pain relief, plenty of people select that option first. What if energy healing was more widely known? You don't see constant commercials or ads for energy healers in San Diego, CA. Instead, we see large pharmaceutical companies with huge budgets that can afford to run commercials every 15 minutes. Today, we uncover what energy healing is and where you can find it in San Diego. What is Energy Healing? Energy healing (energy work) is a set of holistic modalities that work with the energetic fields to help people heal from physical and emotional pain. The foundation of energy healing is the connection between the mind and body. Energy healing taps into your field (measurable wavelengths of energy), and the energetic fields around you, to bring peace to your body and soul. With the belief that everything is energy, that means everything is connected. Your emotional or mental state affects and influences your physical body. Energy healers work to clear negative auras in people's lives. They work on the cellular level to help create huge changes in people's energetic states. The way that you feel energetically can greatly influence how you experience life. People that feel bogged down by negativity, pain, and suffering are likely to have more bad days than others. Storing Negative Energy & Emotional Trauma Naturally, when humans go through physical or emotional trauma, we commonly - and unknowingly - store this negative energy in our physical bodies. Emotional trauma can show up instantly, like a stomachache or headache. It can also appear years down the road as chronic injuries. Do you know anyone that gets random aches and pains even though they are considered 'healthy'? Not always, but there's a chance that something negative has happened or is going on in their life. Energy healing helps people overcome negative energy caused by past traumas. Humans - as a defense system - bury emotional trauma instead of confronting it. When you experience energy healing, you allow yourself to be vulnerable. Professional energy healers in San Diego can help you break through these emotional barriers. Let the energy flow through you to vanquish any negative that has been holding you back! Every day in life is meant to feel extraordinary. Reaching that level of positive energy is possible! Energy healing can help you get there. Types of Energy Healers in San Diego Are you interested in finding an energy healer in San Diego? Fortunately, California has plenty of options.

Tarot Card Readings When people think of energy healing, many picture tarot card readings. If you've never had your tarot cards read, it's quite the experience. Avoid the shanty places along the side of Highway 5 [in San Diego](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego) when looking for a tarot card reader. This energy healing practice involves using a deck of cards to help predict someone's past, present, or future. Are you searching for answers to things in your life? A tarot card reading can be incredibly enlightening. This energy healing modality is known as cartomancy, which is fortune-telling using cards. You can gain great insight into your life when working with a legitimate tarot card reader in San Diego County. Yelp is a great place to start when searching for different energy healers throughout the San Diego area. When the cards are pulled, the practitioner interprets them and provides you insight into your life. 5. Muscle Testing Muscle Testing is a non-invasive energy healing technique that measures life energy and chi within the body. The focus of these energy healers is body-mind wellness. A biofeedback test is performed to assess a patient's energetic vitality. A Muscle Testing Practitioner will apply gentle pressure to different muscles as they contract. From here, they measure/gauge the response of the muscle. These responses can be incredibly minimal because they are measuring the life energy from the body. The goal of these energy healers is to help you break through limiting beliefs and release stored emotional trauma. Your life energy is very telling and will indicate to the practitioner your current energetic state. When someone's life energy is low, they are more susceptible to becoming sick or injured. Muscle Testing helps identify energetic blocks that you're experiencing through your life energy. 6. Energy Clearing Also known as energy cleansing, energy clearing is a holistic practice used to clear out negative vibrations. Everything is energy and vibration. For example, have you ever felt nervous walking into a room with strangers and then started to sweat? That is your body picking up on the energy within the room. Perhaps you've entered a building that is believed to be haunted. There are certain energies that you will pick up on as you walk throughout that place. What can we do about a place that feels stuck with negative energy? Energy healers in San Diego use a variety of cleansing techniques to clear out a space. You can open up the energy of a room through holistic practices like burning sage. You can also perform different chants and sound healing exercises with sound bowls. Energy clearing is an effective and natural way to free up the 'stuckness' of a place. You can perform this energy healing technique on your own by picking up sage and performing several ceremonies by yourself. This can help cleanse any negative energy associated with that room or place.
