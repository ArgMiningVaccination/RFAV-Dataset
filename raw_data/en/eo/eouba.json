So go ahead and give one - or a few - a try! Jump to: What is a Clean Eating diet? Basically, it is eating from scratch, or as close to nature as possible. This would include organic foods whenever possible, healthy fats, and choosing whole grains instead of processed or refined foods. It's a healthy way to eat and surprisingly easy to maintain and is a way of life more than a diet. Plus, once you eat clean you realize how you were missing a lot of flavor in your life! My hope is that you will soon learn that healthy recipes taste great, can save you a lot of money, and help you feel so much better in the long run. What can you eat when eating clean? - Fresh fruit - All fresh fruit is clean. Canned, frozen, dried, and fruit juice are all ok too. Just make sure it doesn't have any added sugars or other ingredients. - Vegetables - Any fresh fruit and frozen or canned vegetables without added ingredients. - Protein - Single-ingredient meats, eggs, nuts, seafood, legumes - Whole Grains - Unprocessed (not white) grains, such as whole wheat, brown rice, [quinoa](https://amzn.to/2H66H0z) [*](https://www.mynaturalfamily.com/disclosure-notice/), oats, or popcorn. - Dairy - Any dairy is fine as long as it doesn't have unclean ingredients Breakfast There's no need to skip the most important meal of the day.
