Since the Science and Technology Committee was reformed in October 2009, we have been running a novel prog ramme of work that we have called \"Evide nce Check\". The purpose of Evidence Check is to examine how the Government uses ev idence to formulate and review its policies. We have focussed on narrow policy ar eas and asked the Government to answer t wo questions: (1) what is the po licy? and (2) on what evidence is the policy based? In Decembe r 2009 we published our fi rst Evidence Chec k on Early Literacy Interventions.1 2. This is the second Evidence Ch eck report. It examines the Government's po licies on the provision of homeopathy through the National Health Service (NHS) and the licensing of homeopathic products by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regu latory Agency (MHRA). We selected th is topic following the Government's responses in September 2009 to questions we asked abou t the evidence base underpinning several different policies. The Government's respon se on homeopathy indicated that scientific evide nce was not used to formulate the licensing regim e operated by the MHRA.2 We were surprised by this response and decided to broaden the inquiry to include consideration of the evidence base underpinning the Government's policy regardin g the funding of home opathy on the NHS. The inquiry 3. This inquiry had a dual focu s on the NHS and the MHRA. In October 2009 we issued a call for written evidence on: Government policy on licensing of homeo pathic products; Government policy on the funding of homeopathy throug h the NHS; and the evidence base on homeop athic products and services.3 4. This inquiry was an examin ation of the evidence behi nd government policies on homeopathy, not an inquiry into homeopathy. We do not challenge the intentions of those homeopaths who strive to cure patients, nor do we question th at many people feel they have benefited from it. Our ta sk was to determine whether scientific evidence supports government policies t hat allow the funding and provision of hom eopathy through the NHS and the licensing of homeop athic products by the MHRA. 5. We received around 60 written submission s. Because we had rece ived a response from the Government on MHRA licensing prior to calling for written submissions,4 the 1 Science and Technology Committee, Second Report of Session 2009-10, Evidence Check 1: Early Literacy Interventions , HC 44 2 Ev 60 3 \"New Inquiry, Evidence Check: Homeopathy\", House of Commons Science and Technology Committee press notice No. 11, Session 2008-09 4 Ev 60 4 Evidence Check 2: Homeopathy Government's response on that as pect of the inquiry was availa ble for interested parties to read and comment on in their written submissi ons. Additionally, some were received after the oral evidence sessions had concluded and so me of these commented on the oral evidence.5 We also received many background papers relating to the inquiry. 6. On 25 November 2009 we took oral evidence from two pa nels; one focused on NHS funding and provision of hom eopathy and the other on MHRA licensing. The expertise of the witnesses on each panel spre ad across both topics and th ere was overlap on the issues discussed, particularly in relation to the evidence base. On 30 November 20 09 we took oral evidence from Mike O'Brien QC MP, Minister fo r Health Services , Professor David Harper, Chief Scientist at the Department of Health (DH), and Pr ofessor Kent Woods, Chief Executive of the MHRA, on the Government 's policies. 7. We carefully considered all the background documents, written submissions and oral evidence in drawing up our conclusions and recommenda tions. We woul d like to put on record our thanks to all those who made submissions and gave evidence to the inquiry. Structure of the report 8. This report is in two parts. Chapter 2 addr esses the evidence base for the provision of homeopathy on the NHS. Chapte r 3 examines the evidence ba se for the MHRA's licensing regime for homeopathic produc ts. In each chapte r we have adopted the approach we followed in the first Evidence Check inquiry: we have outlined the Government's policy, summarised what we would expect of a good evidence base and then evaluated whether the Government's policy is su fficiently evidence-based (the Evidence Check). 5 For example , Ev 189-194 Evidence Check 2: Homeopathy 5 2 NHS funding and provision What is homeopathy? 9. Homeopathy is a 200-ye ar old system of medici ne that seeks to treat patients with highly diluted substances that are administered orally. Homeopathy is based on two principles: \"like-cures-like\" whereby a substance that causes a symptom is used in diluted form to treat the same symptom in illness6 and \"ultra-dilution\" wh ereby the more dilute a substance the more potent it is (this is aided by a specif ic method of shaking the solutions, termed \"succussion\").7 It is claimed that ho meopathy works by stimulating the body's self- healing mechanisms.8 10. Homeopathic products shou ld not be confused with herbal remedies. Some homeopathic products are deri ved from herbal active ingr edients, but the important distinction is that homeopathi c products are extremely dilute d and administer ed according to specific principles. The policy 11. The Department of Health (DH) told us t hat it \"does not maintain a position\" on any complementary or alternative tr eatment, including homeopathy.9 Decisions on the use of homeopathy are left to the Nati onal Health Service (NHS).10 Primary Care Trusts (PCTs) are responsible for comm issioning care services11 and are thus currently free to fund homeopathy. 12. Homeopathy was introduced into Britain in the 1830s and has been funded and provided on the NHS sinc e its inception in 1948.12 There are four homeo pathic hospitals in the UK, located in London, Br istol, Liverpool and Gl asgow. These hospit als fall under the jurisdiction of their respective PCTs. A ho meopathic hospital in Tunbridge Wells was closed in 2009 followi ng a drop in referrals to the hospital and a revi ew by the West Kent PCT on the commissioning of homeopathy.13 13. The Government was unable to tell us how much money th e NHS spends on homeopathy as \"data on spendi ng in the area of homeopathy on the National Health Service has never been routinely collected\".14 When he gave oral e vidence Mike O'Brien, Minister for Health Services at the DH, was, however, able to say that: 6 We examine the issue of \"like-cures-like\" in more detail at paragraph 50 and following. 7 \"How does homeopathy work?\", British Homeopathic Association , y-soh.org Ev para 7 11 Ev 61, para 11 12 Ev 174, para 2.1 13 Ev 61, para 9; see also paragraph 83 and following. 14 Ev 62, para 18 6 Evidence Check 2: Homeopathy In terms of drugs it is \u00a3152,000 a year wh ich comes from a budget of \u00a311 billion. It is approximately 0.001 per cent, we calculated, of the drugs budget. In terms of overall funding it is very difficult to know. We have done some work to see if we can find out what it is. We have four hospitals\u2014 one in Glasgow, three in England\u2014which provide homeopathic as sistance to people and we do provide so me NHS funding for those, so it would run into several million on that basis, so prob ably less than 12\u2014 I think I saw that in The Guardian as a quote\u2014so probably le ss than that but not too much less.15 14. In June 2009 the Guardian reported th at the NHS had spent \u00a312 million on homeopathy in the period 2005-08.16 According to the Society of Homeopaths, the NHS spends \u00a34 million on homeopathy annually.17 It appears that these figures do not include maintenance and running costs of the homeop athic hospitals or th e \u00a320 million spent on refurbishing the Royal London Homeop athic Hospital betw een 2002 and 2005.18 15. When we asked Dr Mathie of the British Homeopathic Association (BHA) whether money spent by the NHS on home opathy could be usefu lly redirected elsewhere, he replied that \"there is a need for co st-effectiveness evaluation of homeopathy. Th ere is almost none\".19 It is impossible to evaluate the overa ll cost-effectiveness of homeopathy provided by the NHS if the cost is unknown. We recommend that the G overnment determine the total amount of money spent by the NHS on homeopathy annually over the past 10 years, differentiating homeopathic produc ts, patient referrals and maintenance and refurbishment of homeopathic hosp itals, and publish the figures. Our expectations of the evidence base 16. The NHS Constitution, which outl ines patient rights, states: You have the right to expect local decisions on fundin g of [...] drugs and treatments to be made rationally fo llowing a proper conside ration of the evidence.20 17. This statement summarises our own expect ations. NHS funding of treatments is expensive and of high societal importance, and therefore it is crucial that decisions are made on the best available e vidence. We would expect the Government's policy on NHS funding and provision of hom eopathy to be evidence-based. We outline be low our views on the different types of evide nce and their individu al importance as a component of the overall evidence base. 15 Q 244 16 \"Critics find NHS's \u00a312m spend on homeopathy hard to swallow\", The Guardian , 10 June 2009 17 Ev 141, para 8.3 18 \"New developments: Royal London Homeopathic Hospital redevelopment\", University College London Hospitals press release, 16 June 2005 19 Q 128 20 Department of Health, \"The NHS Constitution for England\" , January 2009 Evidence Check 2: Homeopathy 7 Scientific plausibility 18. Medical interventions are usually supported by explanations for how they work and the same is true of homeopathy. Scientific ex planations for a mech anism of action are important because they can le ad to refinements of medicines: for ex ample, new vaccines for viruses based on the known mechanisms of immu nisation. Unde rstanding a mechanism of action can also enable the development of entire ly new medicines: for example, the persistent threat of resistance means that new anti-malarial drugs with novel mechanisms of action are continually required.21 Our expectation of an explanation for a mechanism of action is that it is both scie ntifically plausible and demonstrable. We should, however, add that, while we comment on expl anations for how home opathy works, it is not a key part of ou r Evidence Check. Historically, some medical interv entions were demonstrably effective before an yone understood their modes of action. For example, after 150 years of use, there is still debate about precisely how anaesthetics work.22 It is more important to know whether a treatment works\u2014its efficacy\u2014than how it works. Evidence of efficacy Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) 19. Randomised Controlled Tr ials (RCTs) are the be st way of determining whether a cause- effect relationship exists betw een a treatment and an outcome.23 Well designed RCTs have the following important features: randomisation: patients should be ra ndomly allocated to placebo (dummy treatment)24 or treatment groups\u2014t his ensures that ther e are no systematic differences between patie nt groups that may affect the outcome; controlled conditions: aside fr om the treatment given, all patients should be treated identically, whether in plac ebo or treatment groups\u2014thi s excludes other factors from influencing the outcome; intention to treat analysis: pat ients are analysed within th eir allocated group even if they did not experience th e intervention\u2014this mainta ins the advantages of randomisation which may be lost if patients with draw or fail to comply; double blinding: patients and clinician s should remain unawar e of which patients received placebo or treatment until the study is completed\u2014this eliminates the possibility of preconceived vie ws of patients an d clinicians affect ing the outcome; and placebo controlled: if there is no appropri ate alternative treatment against which to compare the test treatment, the intervention under consideration is tested against a dummy treatment to see if the intervention has any be nefit or side effects. 21 T Wells, P Alonso and W Gutteridge, \"New medicines to improve control and contribute to the eradication of malaria\", Nature Reviews , November 2009, vol 8: 879 22 \"Anaesthesia\", BBC Medical Notes, 2 May 2006, news.bbc.co.uk 23 \"Understanding controlled trials: Why are randomised controlled trials important?\", BMJ,1998, vol 316, p 201 24 Placebos and the placebo effect are considered at paragraph 30 and following. 8 Evidence Check 2: Homeopathy 20. In clinical research, it is widely accepted that RCTs ar e the best way to evaluate the efficacy of different treatm ents and distinguish them fr om placebos. However, some supporters of homeopathy claim that RCTs ar e not an appropriate way to test homeopathy because \"they are far less suitable when studying the overall effects of a holistic therapy in a complex organism with multiple problems\".25 We do not agree. If homeopathic products\u2014 or any medicinal product\u2014are mo re than placebos, and all other elements of the \"holistic\" care package are the same (controlled), it sh ould be possible to see differential results between the test substance and the placebo. We consider that conclusions about the evidence on the efficacy of homeopathy should be derived fr om well designed and rigorous randomised co ntrolled trials (RCTs). Meta-analyses and systematic reviews 21. There may be variation in the results produced by different RCTs, particula rly if there are many trials with low statistical power, that is, small trials with low numbers of participants. When trials produce varying results, proponents of both sides of an argument can \"cherry-pick\" data to supp ort whichever side of the argu ment they like. This is a situation we wish to avoid. We can do so by turning to two types of analysis of clinical trials to help us appraise the evidence: meta-analyses and sy stematic reviews. 22. Meta-analyses combine the resu lts of trials, increasing the sample size and statistical power of the data. Meta-analyse s may reveal statisti cally significant tren ds that were not apparent by studying the trials individually. Wh en pooling data, it is important to ensure that the data are comparable. It is prefer able that a meta-analy sis only include well designed trials, since these trials produce th e most rigorous data. When meta-analyses are conducted on less well-designed trials, the design flaws sh ould be recognised and the diminished power of th e data acknowledged. 23. Systematic reviews refer to the process of collecti ng, reviewing and pr esenting all the available evidence, for example, by select ing trials listed in the PubMed database26 that meet pre-defined criteria. Sy stematic reviews often, but not always, include a meta- analysis.27 24. Properly conducted systematic reviews have the following important features: the prior determination and explanation of eligibil ity criteria (which will allow or disallow inclusion of pu blished studies) for the systematic review; a literature search lookin g for all potentially rele vant published studies; examination of the methodology of all po tential candidate stu dies to ensure that they fit the eligibility criter ia; this includes clear ru les about the design and methodology of such studies. assembly of the most co mplete datas et feasible; 25 Ev 135 [Dr Eames], Centre Biotechnology , www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed 27 \"An introduction to meta-analysis\", The Cochrane Collaboration , www.cochrane-net.org Evidence Check 2: Homeopathy 9 analysis of the results of incl uded studies, with statistica l analysis (meta-analysis) if appropriate; and a critical summary of the systematic review, includin g identification of the \"confidence intervals\"28 and \"statistical significance\"29 of any findings. 25. We expect the conclusions on the evidence for th e efficacy of hom eopathy to give particular weight to properly conducted me ta-analyses and systematic reviews of RCTs. The distinction between efficacy and effectiveness 26. It has been suggested that it is useful to dr aw a distinction be tween efficacy and effectiveness.30 Dr Peter Fisher, Director of the Royal London Homeopathic Hospital, explained the difference: In simple terms the distinction is betw een ideal conditions and real world conditions\u2014efficacy being ideal conditions and ef fectiveness being real world conditions.31 27. Professor Edzard Erns t, Director of the Peninsula Me dical School, gave the following example: Efficacy tests whether treatment works under ideal conditio ns; for instance, a hypertensive agent may well be effective under ideal cond itions and then will not work in the real world because people experience side-effects.32 28. The opposite might also occur: a product might not work in \"ideal\" conditions, but may appear effective in \"the real world\". In the case of homeo pathy, arguments have predominantly centred around whether or not it is a placebo treatmen t. If homeopathy was better than a placebo treatmen t, one would expect tests of efficacy to show that it is efficacious; and \"real world\" tests of effectiveness to sh ow that it may or may not be effective. If homeopathy was a placebo treatmen t, it would fail tests of efficacy, but with tests of effectiveness it would app ear to be effective for some conditions and some patients, but not for others. A summary of the logical outcomes depending on whether homeopathy is or is not a placebo Efficacy Effectiveness Homeopathy is not a placebo PASSEITHER PASS OR FAIL Homeopathy is a placebo FAIL 29. The answer to why a me dicine can be effective without being efficacious lies with a phenomenon known as the placebo effect. 28 A confidence interval helps assess the likelihood of a result occurring by chance. A confidence interval represents a range of values that is believed to encompass the \"true\" value with high probability (usually 95%). 29 A result is defined as statistically significant if it is unlikely to have occurred by chance, t ypically when the probability of obtaining that result by chance is less than 5%. 30 Ev 162 [Dr Relton] 31 Q 116 32 As above 10 Evidence Check 2: Homeopathy Placebos and the placebo effect 30. There is extensive scientif ic literature on placebos and the placebo effect.33 31. The most frequently quoted de finition of a placebo ca me from Arthur Shapiro, a psychiatrist, who in 1964 described a placebo as \"any therapeutic procedure which has an effect on a patient, symptom, syndrome or disease, but which is objectively wi thout specific activity for the cond ition being treated\".34 32. Shapiro then described the placebo effect as \"the psyc hological or psychophysiological effect produced by placebos\".35 However, this is rather si mplistic and therefore we are attracted to the definition produced by Dr H oward Brody, Director of the Institute of Medical Humanities at the University of Te xas Medical Branch, wh o defined the placebo effect as \"a change in a pati ent's illness attr ibutable to the symbolic import of a treatment rather than a specific pharmacol ogic or physiologic property\".36 According to this definition, the placebo effect does no t necessarily require a dummy treatment.37 It is important to remember that when patients receive an eff icacious treatment, they may benefit from a placebo (non-speci fic) effect as well as the spe cific effect of the treatment. Brody's definition also allows for a wider rang e of non-specific effects, such as the doctor- patient relationship, to be relevant to the placebo effect. 33. To complete the picture, it is worth mentioning that the im pact of the placebo effect may be positive or negative. In common usage, \"placebo ef fect\" refers to a positive response. When there is a negat ive outcome, it is often referr ed to as the \"nocebo effect\".33 34. The placebo effect should not be confused with other phenomena . Sometimes patients just get better and some times symptoms fl uctuate in severity. If a pat ient seeks the advice of a homeopath, GP or any other he alth specialist, when he or she is feel ing most ill with a condition that would get better of it s own accord, fo r example a comm on cold, it is statistically likely that he or she will begin re covery soon after the consultation anyway (the natural course of a disease). If a patient seek s advice when he or sh e is sufferin g badly from a symptom that fluctuates in seve rity, for example the pain of oste oarthritis, it is statistically likely that he or she will expe rience alleviation of the symptom s soon after the consultation anyway (regression to the mean). The effect s of the natural cour se of a disease and regression to the mean should be di stinguished from the placebo effect.38 35. The precise mechanisms of the placebo ef fect are not well understood. However, studies have shown the following: 33 J M Anton de Craen, Ted J Kaptchuk, Jan G P Tijssen a nd J Kleijen, \"Placebos and placebo effects in medicine: historical overview\", Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine , vol 92 (1999), pp 511-515 34 A K Shapiro, \"Factors contributing to the place bo effect. Their implications for psychotherapy\", American Journal of Psychotherapy, vol 18 (1964), pp 73-88 35 As above 36 Brody H. \"Placebos and the Philosophy of Medi cine. Clinical, Conceptual and Ethical Issues\", University of Chicago Press , 1980 37 de Craen et al, as above 38 E Ernst and K L Resch, \"Concept of true and perceived placebo effects\", BMJ, 1995, vol 311, pp 551-553 Evidence Check 2: Homeopathy 11 The placebo effect can be powerful but is us ually only effective for relatively minor ailments.39 The placebo effect is unpredictable. It is not possible to charac terise who will be a \"placebo responder\" (someone who reacts well to placebo treatment).40 Nor has it been possible to establish conclusively how many patie nts experience a placebo effect. The placebo effect is cultur ally specific. Colours affect the perceived action of a drug and seem to influence the effectiven ess of a drug. For example red, yellow, and orange are associated with a stimulant ef fect, while blue and green are related to a tranquillising effect.41 The route of administration al so has an effect . For example, one study showed that subcuta neous (injected) placebos were more effective than oral placebos in the treatment of migraine.42 36. Professor Ernst su mmarised the problem with prescribing placebos in the NHS: I would argue it is unnece ssary, unreliable and uneth ical to prescribe placebos through the NHS; unnecessary because if you do it well then an ac tive treatment will also generate a placebo effect. If I give my pat ient an aspirin for his or her headache and I do it with empathy, time and understand ing this patient w ill benefit from the pharmacological effect of the aspirin and she will also benefit from the placebo effect through the encounter with her clinician. It is unreliable and there is lots of data to show that placebo effects ar e notoriously unreliable; somebody who responds today may not respond tomorrow; resp onses are not large in effe ct size and they are not usually long-lasting. Foremost, it is unethical.43 37. Despite the power of the placebo effect, there are a number of reasons why pure placebos are not used routinely (officially) in the medical profession. First, as outlined above, the placebo effect is unpredictable and highly susceptibl e to individual patient expectations and therefore not a reliable treatment on its own. Second, there is a placebo effect included in the delivery of efficacious tr eatment so it is not necessary to deliver a placebo effect in isolation. Third, to maximi se the impact of placeb os, doctors need to deceive their patients by, for example, telling them that the placebo pills they are receiving are in fact a \"proper\" drug. To a certain extent, the grea ter the deception the stronger the placebo effect. The nature of deception can vary between: unintentional deception: where the practi tioner prescribes a placebo, sincerely believing that it is efficacious; 39 Ev 1 [RPSGB], para 3.08 40 A K Shapiro, \"Factors contributing to the place bo effect. Their implications for psychotherapy\", American Journal of Psychotherapy, vol 18 (1964), pp 73-88 41 A J de Craen, P J Roos, S Leonard de Vrie, J Kleijnen, \"Effect of colour of drugs: systematic review of perceived effect of drugs and of their effectiveness\", BMJ,1996 Dec 21-28, vol 313 (7072) pp 1624-6. 42 A J de Craen, J G P Tijssen, J de Gans and J Kleijnen, \"Placebo effect in the acute treatment of migraine: subcutaneous placebos are better than oral placebos\", J Neurol, 2000, vol 247: pp 83-188 43 Q 126 12 Evidence Check 2: Homeopathy paternalistic deception: where the practition er prescribes a placebo, knowing it is not efficacious but believin g that it may be benefici al to the patient; and dishonest deception: where the practitioner prescribes a placebo, knowing it is not efficacious, without acting in the patient's best interest (for example, if they have a vested interest in the plac ebo product or merely wish to send the patient away). 38. Deception arguably abuses the doctor-patient relationship and may undermine trust. It also removes informed patient choice, because the pat ient is being asked to make decisions under false pretences. It represents a revers al of the welcome and recent approach to treating patients as equals who have the r ight to make fully info rmed decisions about treatment options. One could al so argue that using placebos is not go od medical practice: placebos treat symptoms, not ca uses, and doctors should be tackling the causes of disease wherever possible. Even where only symptomatic relief is re quired, doctors should rely on evidence-based, efficaci ous medicines. Some doctors have argued that th ey administer placebos to demonstrate to a patient that the condition is psychological,44 but this misunderstands the power of the placebo effect which can make a patien t feel better even when there is a serious underlying condition. (We examine the ethica l issues further at paragraph 93 and following.) 39. We have set out the issue of efficacy and effectiveness at some length to illustrate that a non-efficacious medicine might, in some si tuations, be effective (patients feel better) because of the placebo effect. That is why we put mo re weight on evidence of efficacy than of effectiveness. 40. The placebo effect may manife st when any medical interven tion is given and therefore the placebo effect is important in unde rstanding why medical interventions work. We would expect the Government to have a proper unders tanding of the power and complexities of the placebo effect and the ethic al issues surrounding its use in a clinical setting; otherwise it cannot ho pe to make good decisions relating to patients and public health. Patient satisfaction 41. We received submission s from patients and practitioner s testifying to the benefits of homeopathy as well as written submissions citing observational patient studies. We also received requests to take oral evidence from patien ts who had benefite d from homeopathy. These submissions and requests led us to consider carefully wh at kind of evidence reports of patient satisfaction const ituted and whether taking or al evidence from patients was necessary or appropriate. 42. Our key consideration was wh ether evidence of patient satisfaction would add any insight into whether homeopathy wo rks beyond placebo. This is an issue that the House of Lords Science and Technology Committee co nsidered in detail du ring its 1999-2000 inquiry on complementary and alternative medicines (CAM). It reported: 44 House of Lords, Complementary and Alternative Medicine , Sixth Report of the Select Committee on Science and Technology, Session 1999-2000, HL Paper 123, para 3.21 Evidence Check 2: Homeopathy 13 We have heard many conflicti ng opinions on the idea that high levels of patient satisfaction could be used as evidence for a therap y's efficacy. It has been argued by some that such satisfaction is very important [...] because much of CAM emphasises patients' participation in th e therapy and evaluation of its effects. Many other witnesses have asserted that although patient satisfacti on has its place it is not sufficient to justify acceptin g that a therapy works so t hat objective rather than subjective evidence is need ed. The Academy of Medical Sc iences explained why this may be: \"It needs to be emphasised that patient satisfaction is not in itself a sufficient estimate of clinical benefit. While it is very important that patients be satisfied with the efforts made on their behalf, it is at least equally importan t that they should obtain objective benefit. Th e two do not always go toget her. For example, patients with peripheral vascular disease, if they go to a practitioner who allows them to continue smoking will show a high patient satisfaction although their outcome will be poor. In contrast, if they are made to stop smoking they ar e likely to be dissatisfied but their outcome will be much better\".45 43. Another example of how pa tient satisfaction may no t correlate to the medical intervention might be if a patient seeks treatment for a common cold. The patient's perception of the quality of the consultation and whether a course of treatment has been prescribed may contribute to pa tient satisfaction, irrespecti ve of whether the treatment itself is effective; the patient would have become better anyway. The House of Lords Committee concluded: patient satisfaction has its pl ace as part of the evidence base for CAM but its position is complicated, as Sir Mich ael Rawlins [Chairman of NICE], explained: \"The difficulty, of course, is that very often the anecdotal evid ence relates to conditions where there is fluctuation in the clinical course and people who start an intervention at a time when there is a na tural resolution of the disea se, very unders tandably, are likely to attribute cause and effect when it may not be. But, on the other hand, there are some anecdotes that are quite clearly important.\" Therefor e, ideally studies should include patient satisfaction as one of a number of measures in evaluating a treatment, but it alone cannot be taken as a proof or otherwise of a treatment's efficacy or as evidence to justify provision.46 44. We have already outlined that treatments may seem effectiv e irrespective of whether they are efficacious. Patient sati sfaction therefore, does not he lp us to distinguish between efficacious and placebo treatments; on that basi s, it is of less rele vance to reso lving this issue than randomised controlled trials, and meta-analyses and systematic reviews of RCTs. We agree that patient sa tisfaction may be relevant to the consideration of the effectiveness of treatmen ts in the real world, ra ther than efficacy, but its main contribution would be to identify that resear ch may be needed to establish wh ether there is a real effect. 45 HL Paper paras 4.21-4.27 46 HL Paper 2: Homeopathy Homeopathic provings 45. A homeopathic \"proving\" is the method by which homeopaths determine what symptoms or diseases a product could be used to treat. A proving records the effects of substances, either at concentrated doses or in ultra- dilutions, when given to healthy individuals. Homeopaths use the symptom profiles of substanc es to prescrib e homeopathic remedies to patients on th e like-cures-like principle. Fo r example, a proving may demonstrate that coffee keeps people awake an d so coffee is used to make a homeopathic remedy to treat insomnia.47 46. Provings are not design ed to provide evidence of efficacy an d homeopaths do not claim that they do. Summary 47. Our expectations of the evidence base re levant to government policies on the provision of homeopathy ar e straightforward. We woul d expect the Government to have a view on the efficacy of homeopathy so as to inform its policy on the NHS funding and provision of hom eopathy. Such a view shoul d be based on the best available evidence, that is, rigorous random ised controlled trials and meta-analyses and systematic reviews of R CTs. If the effects of homeopathy can be primarily attributed to the placebo effect, we would expect the Govern ment to have a view on the ethics of prescribing placebos. The evidence check Scientific plausibility for a mode of action 48. Both critics and supporters of homeopathy have questioned the scientific plausibility of any direct physiological mode of action. For exampl e, the Royal Pharma ceutical Society of Great Britain (RPSGB), which is firmly in the \"critic\" camp,48 argues that \"no plausible scientific reason has ye t been proposed as to why it should work\".49 The Prince's Foundation for Integrated Health, which is more supportive of homeopathy,50 also notes: \"any specific mechanis m of action based on extreme dilut ion is implausibl e and regarded as unsupportable by the majority of scientists wo rking in this field\".51 49. There appear to be two main conc erns. The first is the prin ciple of like-cures-like and the second is about how ultra-dilutions could reta in characteristics of the active ingredient. We deal with each in turn. 47 \"What is homeopathy?\", The Society of Homeopaths 50 Ev 179, para 11 51 Ev 179, para 10 Evidence Check 2: Homeopathy 15 Like-cures-like principle 50. The principle of like-c ures-like was described by Dr Peter Fisher as analogous to the principle of toxicology hormesis.52 Professor Edward Calabrese, a toxicology expert from the University of Massachusett s, has described hormesis as \"a dose-respons e relationship phenomenon characterized by low-dose stimulation and high -dose inhibition\".53 In other words, the impact of toxins on physiology depe nds on dose: substances that are toxic in high doses may be beneficial in low doses. For ex ample, \"as the dose of a carcinogen decreases, it reaches a point where the agent ac tually may reduce the risk of cancer below that of the control group\".54 And this has been likened to the like-cures-like principle central to homeopathy,55 whereby a substance that causes a particular symptom will cure that symptom if administered at a low dose. 51. There are two aspects of the argument that the like-cures- like principle is based on hormesis that concern us. a) Over-extrapolation: it is no t good scientific practice to conclude that because some substances are harmful at high doses and beneficial at low doses, that all substances behave in the same way; and b) Provings using ultra-dilutions : the similarity with hormes is breaks down further if provings are carried out using ultra-dilutions. Hormesis is a dose-response: it provides no rationale for expecting an ultra-dilution to cause symptoms in \"healthy\" people and the same ultra-dilution to cure th ose symptoms in \"unwell\" people. 52. We have a further concern abou t the like-cures-like principle . It is not reasonable to lump \"symptoms\" into categories independent of physiological causation. For example, there are many different kinds of stimulants \u2014caffeine, nicotine, amphetamines\u2014but the metabolic pathways they use ion differ. The princip le of like- cures-like overlooks this complication, by holding that any kind of st imulant could, at low enough doses, counteract inso mnia. But insomnia is caused by different things, such as pain, hormonal changes, psychologica l disorders or jet lag as well as the use of stimulants. Treating the symptoms and ig noring the causes is simply not good me dical practice. 53. Finally, there are examples of practice. We are concerned by some homeopathic products. For example, it is possible to buy homeopathic products made from body parts such as hip joints and colons, animals such as iguana and dragonfly, and different kinds of sunlight. We are doubly concer ned that it is also possible to buy products derived from precious archaeological feat ures such as the Great Wa ll of China and Stonehenge. 56 We do not understand what symptoms could be induced (and theref ore be treated) by these products under the like -cures-like principle. 52 Ev 22, para 10 53 Edward J Calabrese and Linda A Baldwin, \"HORMESIS: The Dose-Response Revolution\", Annual Review of Pharmacology and Toxicology, April 2003, 43, 175-197 54 Edward J Calabrese, \"Hormesis: a revolution in toxicology, risk assessment and medicine\", European Molecular Biology Organization , Vol 5 (2004), pp S37-S40 55 \"What 21/1/2010\", Helios Homeopathy Ltd. , www.helios.co.uk 16 Evidence Check 2: Homeopathy 54. We conclude that the principle of like-cures- like is theoretically weak. It fails to provide a credible physiologi cal mode of action for homeopathic products. We note that this is the settled view of medical science.57 Ultra-dilutions 55. Under the homeopathic princip les, \"the greater the dilut ion, the more potent the medicine\".58 Dr Peter Fisher, Director of the Royal London Home opathic Hospital, described how homeopath ic dilutions are made: [They] prepared by a proc ess of sequential dilution wi th vigorous shaking at each stage of dilution, known as su ccussion. Dilution is usually in steps of 1:10 or 1:100, referred to as x or d (decimal ) or c (centesimal) respectively.59 56. For example, a 30C dilution indicates that the so lution has been diluted in the ratio of 1:100, thirty times successively; one drop of the original solu tion would be d iluted with 100 drops of water and the resulting solution wou ld be diluted again, and so on until 30 dilutions had taken place. According to the Prin ce's Foundation for In tegrated Health, in some homeopathic products \"not even a single molecule of the original substance remains in the diluted medicine pres cribed to the patient\".60 57. Dr Fisher stated that the pr ocess of \"shaking is important\"61 but was unable to say how much shaking was required. He said \"t hat has not been fully investigated\"62 but did tell us that \"You have to shake it vig orously [...] if you just stir it gently, it does not work\".63 58. A number of theories have been proposed to explain how water that does not contain a single molecule of the active ingredient can retain the properties of that ingredient and have a physiological action on the patient. Th e most frequently ment ioned in the written evidence is the theory of \"molecular memory\", which prop oses that water can retain some imprint of substances previous ly dissolved in it. So me of the explanations for how water might remember substances dissolved in it cite electromagnetic properties,64 frequency imprinting,65 quantum physics66 and supra-molecular behavio ur of water (that is, large- scale interactions).67 59. There are enormous difficulties presented by the notion that water can \"remember\" substances that have previous ly been dissolved in it. When substanc es are dissolved in 57 For example Ev 4 60 Ev 179, para 8 61 Q 155 62 Q 157 63 Q 158 64 Ev 128 [Ms Waters] 65 Ev 103 96 [Dr Milgrom], para 5.6 Evidence Check 2: Homeopathy 17 water, the water molecules w ill form structures around the solute molecules; but the hydrogen bonds between water mo lecules are far too weak an d short-lived to hold that structure once the solute has b een removed. It is not surprisi ng that experiments that claim to have demonstrated the memory of water have fa iled to be reproducible.68 The notion that water could hold imprints of solutions previously disso lved in it is so far removed from current scientific unders tanding that, as Professor Da vid Colquhoun, Professor of Pharmacology at UCL, put it: \"I f homeopathy worked the whol e of chemistry and physics would have to be overturned\".69 Professor Jayne Lawrence, Ch ief Scientific Adviser to the RPSGB, put it a littl e less dramatically: I think it probably would be revolutionar y if homeopathy was proved to be right, because it does go ag ainst a lot of fundament al understanding of science as it stands at the moment.70 60. Even if water could retain a me mory of previously dissolved substances we know of no explanation for why the sugar-based homeopat hic pills routinely di spensed would retain such a memory. 61. We consider the notion that ultra-dilutions c an maintain an imprint of substances previously dissolved in them to be scientifically implausible. 62. When we asked Professor David Harper, Chief Scientist at th e DH, about the scientific plausibility of homeopat hy, he agreed with o ur assessment that th ere was \"a lack of scientific plausibility in how homeopathic remedies might work\".71 However, he added \"that is not to say there should not be research into like cures like or molecular memory. I think that is a different thing.\"72 63. We would challenge Professor Harper's co mment that research funding should be directed towards exploring theories t hat are not scientifically plausible. Research funding is limited and highly competitive. The Gove rnment should continue its policy of funding the highest quality applications for important scientific research determined on the basis of peer review. 64. The Government Chief Scient ific Adviser, Professor John Beddington, has told us in unequivocal terms that he is of the view that there is no evidence base for homeopathy.73 We recommend that the Government Chief Scientific Adviser and Professor Harper, Chief Scientist at the DH , get together to see if they ca n reach an agreed position on the question of whether there is any merit in research funding being directed towards the claimed modes of action of homeopathy. 68 \"Could water really have a memory?\", BBC News , 25 July 2008, www.news.bbc.co.uk 69 Ev 92, para 3.3 70 Q 104 71 Q 200 72 Q 200; we examine the question of research at paragraph 74 and following. 73 Oral evidence taken before the Innovation, Universities, Science and Skills Committee on 5 November 2008, HC (2007-08) 999-iii, Q297 18 Evidence Check 2: Homeopathy Evidence of efficacy 65. Lack of scientific pl ausibility is disappointing, but does not necessarily mean that a treatment does not work. What is important is how a trea tment performs when tested fairly against a placebo treatment or other trea tments. We consider that the best evidence is provided by randomised controlled trials, meta -analyses and systemat ic reviews of RCTs. 66. We received conflicting opin ions on whether homeopath ic products are efficacious (that is, whether they work better than a placebo treatm ent). The Britis h Homeopathic Association (BHA) told us that: Four out of five comprehens ive systematic reviews of RCTs in homeopathy have reached the qualified conclusion th at homeopathy diff ers from placebo.74 67. Professor Edzard Ernst, Director of th e Complementary Medic ine Group at the Peninsula Medical School, disputed this summary of the evid ence in detail. The systematic reviews to which the BHA refers are: Kleijnen et al, 1991;75 Boissel et al, 2000;77 Linde et al, 1997;78 and Shang et al, 2005.79 Professor Ernst pointed out that: 1. The Kleijnen review is now 18 years old and thus outdated. 2. Boissel et al merely combined p-values80 of the included studies. This article is now also outdated. Furthermore it is not unambiguo usly positive. 3. Cucherat et al is the publication of the Bois sel document which was a EU- sponsored report. [The authors themselves no ted that \"there is some evidence that homeopathic treatments are more effective than placebo; however , the strength of this evidence is low beca use of the low methodologic al quality of the trials.\"81] 4. Linde et al has been re-analysed by various authors, includ ing Linde himself, and all of the 6 re-analyses (n one of which were cited in the BHA's submission) have come out negative. 5. Shang et al very clearly arrived at a devastatingly negative overall conclusion.82 74 Ev 37, para 2.1 75 J Kleijnen, G Riet, Cucherat, M Haugh, E Gauthier, \"Critical literature review on the effectiveness of homoeopathy: overview of the homoeopathic medicine trials \", Homoeopathic Medicine Research Group, Report of the Commission of the European Communities, Directorate-General XII-Science, Research and Development E-RTD Actions: Life Sciences and Technologies-Medical Research, Brussels, Belgium, 1996 77 M Cucherat, M C Haugh, M Gooch, J P Boissel, \"Evidence of clinical efficacy of homeopathy.

If this probab ility is less than 1/20 (which is when the P value is less than 0.05), then the result is conventionally regarded as being statistically significant. 81 M Cucherat et al. , as above 82 Ev 51, para 2 Evidence Check 2: Homeopathy 19 68. Professor Ernst also commented on the BHA's claims about reviews that offered positive review s for allergies,83 upper respiratory tract infections84 and rheumatic diseases85 were equally flawed: the \"review\" on allergies was a lecture series, no t a systematic review; the \"reviews\" on upper respiratory tract infect ions were health technology assessments, not systematic reviews, and mostly contained uncontrolled data; and the \"review\" on rheumatic diseases was not conclusive.86 Finally, he pointed out that the BHA had omitted several systematic reviews and meta-analyses, each of which \"must have been known to the BHA\" and \"all of them arrived at negat ive conclusions\".87 69. The review which we consider the most comp rehensive to date is that by Shang et al.88 The review compared 110 placebo-controlled tr ials of homeopathy matched according to disorder and type of outcome to trials of co nventional medi cine. The study only included trials that were controlled, included random ised assignment to treatment or placebo groups and were accompanie d by sufficient da ta for odds ratio calculations.89 The authors concluded that \"when anal yses were restricted to large trials of higher quality there was no convincing evidence th at homeopathy was supe rior to placebo\".90 70. In our view, the systematic reviews and meta-ana lyses conclusively demonstrate that homeopathic products perfor m no better than placebos. The Government shares our interpretation of the evidence. We asked th e Minister, Mike O' Brien, whether the Government had any credible evid ence that homeopathy works beyond the placebo effect and he responded: \"the straight answer is no\".91 71. We were troubled that the Chief Scientist at the DH seemed to be ou t of step with the accepted scientific conse nsus on the question of ef ficacy. Unlike the Minister,92 he did not agree that there was no cred ible evidence that homeopat hy worked beyond the placebo effect. He stated that \"the maj ority of independent scientists feel that the evidence is weak or absent\"93 and that there are \"real di fficulties\" in draw ing conclusions on efficacy because of a \"lack of agreement between experts working in the field\".94 However, we co uld find no 83 P Bellavite, R Ortolaini, F Pontarolo et al, \"Immunology and homeopathy.

This can be used to show the strength of a relationship between treatment and outcome. 90 Shang A et al, as above 91 Q 175 92 Qq 174-75 93 Q 176 94 Q 177 20 Evidence Check 2: Homeopathy support from independent experts for the idea t hat there is good evidence for the efficacy of homeopathy. 72. The Government Ch ief Scientific Adviser, Professo r John Beddington, was publicly unequivocal about the evidenc e base for homeopathy when he appeared before us in 2008,95 but the Chief Scientist at the DH app eared to take a different position. We recommend that the Government Chief Scie ntific Adviser and Pr ofessor Harper get together to see if they can reach an agreed po sition on the question of whether there is any good evidence for the efficacy of homeopathy and whether there is a genuine scientific controversy over the effica cy of homeopathy and publish this. 73. We regret that advocates of homeopathy , including in their submissions to our inquiry, choose to rely on, and promulgate, select ive approaches to th e treatment of the evidence base as this risks confusing or mi sleading the public, the media an d policy- makers. More research? 74. Robert Wilson, Chairman of the British Association of Homeop athic Manufacturers (BAHM), acknowledged the robu st criticisms of the eviden ce for the efficacy of homeopathy. He told us that there is a \"n eed to have more research into homeopathy; research that can stand up to some of the criticisms that have been placed at it\".96 Dr Robert Mathie, Research Development Adviser for the BHA, shared this view: The British Homeopathic As sociation strongly suppor ts patient choice for treatments that are evidence-based and would propose the de velopment of much greater research in order to secure that e vidence base.97 75. When asked whether there was room for rese arch using public mone y on the efficacy of homeopathy, the Minister said: Is it worth researchin g into? I think there is an argu ment for doing that, yes, given there is NHS money being spent on it and has been over a cons iderable period of time, so the straight answer to your question is yes.98 Professor David Harper, in contrast, told us that: If you are talking about randomised clinical tr ials, I personally do not think that it is an issue of conducting more randomised cli nical trials because there are a whole lot that have been done and meta-analyses.99 76. Dr Ben Goldacre, a medical doctor and journalist, also disagreed: 95 Oral evidence taken before the Innovation, Universities, Science and Skills Committee on 5 November 2008, HC (2007-08) 999-iii, Q297 96 Q 111 97 Q 162 98 Q 199 99 Q 201 Evidence Check 2: Homeopathy 21 There have now been around 200 trials of homeopathy against placebo sugar pills and, taken collectively, they show that there is no e vidence that homeopathy pills are any better than a placebo. [...] it is no t worth doing any more placebo controlled trials because you would be throwing g ood money after bad an d you would have to have a huge number of very st rongly positive trials to outweigh all of the negative ones.100 77. There has been enough testing of homeopat hy and plenty of ev idence showing that it is not efficacious. Compet ition for research funding is fierce and we cannot see how further research on the efficacy of homeopathy is justified in the face of competing priorities. 78. It is also unethical to ente r patients into tria ls to answer question s that have been settled already. Given the different position on this important question between the Minister and his Chief Scient ist, we recommend that the Go vernment Chief Scientific Adviser, Professor John Bedd ington, investigate whethe r ministers ar e receiving effective advice and pu blish his own advice on this question. Effectiveness 79. We proceed on the basis that homeopathy is not supported by evidenc e of efficacy and is therefore no more than a pl acebo treatment, albeit a popular one. But before we discuss government policy in re lation to the evidence, it is im portant to consider what evidence there is on the effect iveness of homeopathy. Patient satisfaction 80. One aspect of effectiveness is patient sa tisfaction. The popularity of homeopathy indicates that many patients are satisfied. Dr Hugh Nielson, Consultant at the Department of Homeopathic Medicine at the Old Swan Health Centre, highlighted several patient outcome surveys including: An observational survey of over 6,500 pati ents over a 6-year period conducted by Bristol Homeopathic Hospita l. 70% of follow-up patients reported improved health, 50% reported a major improvement.101 A survey of 500 patients at the Royal Lo ndon Homeopathic Hospital showing that many patients were able to reduce or stop conventional medication following homeopathic treatment. For example, 72% of patients repo rted being able to stop or reduce their conven tional medication.102 81. Although these surveys show that homeopathy makes some people fe el better, it does not, as we have explained, mean that homeopathy is efficacious. The high levels of patient satisfaction could be attributed to the placebo effect, particular ly enhanced by three factors: 100 Q 87 101 Ev 158, para 3.1 102 Ev 158, para 3.2 22 Evidence Check 2: Homeopathy a) Homeopaths treat the kinds of illnesses that cl ear up on their own (s elf-limiting) or are susceptible to placebo responses; b) Individuals who have be en treated by homeopaths us ually chose homeopathy as a treatment; in other words, they have in vested in the process of undergoing homeopathic treatment, probably because th ey already know that they like it. That means that it is a sel f-selecting group; and c) Homeopathic consult ations are long and empathetic.103 In 2001, a systematic review found that that \"physicians who adopt a warm, friendly, and reassuring manner are more effective than those who keep co nsultations formal and do not offer reassurance\".104 Homeopathic consultations may th erefore have a positive impact on patients' perception of the intervention and result in a more powerful placebo effect. 82. We do not doubt that homeo pathy makes some patients feel better. However, patient satisfaction can occur through a placebo effect alone and therefore does not prove the efficacy of ho meopathic interventions. Cost-effectiveness 83. Patient satisfaction alone may not be sufficient to warrant the expenditure of public money on homeopathy. What is important is how the costs and benefits of particular treatments stack up against each other. At a national level it is not possible to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of homeopathy as the cost has not been determined.105 However, one Primary Care Trust (PCT) has assessed the co st-effectiveness of ho meopathy at a local level. In 2007, the NHS West Kent Primary He alth Care Trust (PCT), which was responsible for a hom eopathic hospital, initiated a review to assess whether the commissioning of homeopathy represented value for money. The consultation process included: a systematic review of the high quality evidence base; production of a consultation document and related questionnaire\u2014sent to a random sample of 1000 of the PCT' s registered patient populati on in addition to those who requested it directly or received a copy th rough their personal connection with homeopathy or the Tunb ridge Wells Homeopathi c Hospital (TWHH); a series of pu blic meetings; and an audit of all GPs in West Kent.106 84. The original public consultation process was challenged in the courts and found to be sufficient. NHS West Kent explained to us that the review \"was not about whether homeopathy works but ra ther whether the NHS, in light of competing priorities, should 103 Q 116 [Professor Ernst] 104 Z di Blasi, E Harkness, E Ernst, A Georgiou, J Kleijnen, \"Influence of context effects on health outcomes: a systematic review\", Lancet ., vol 357, no. 9258 (Mar 10, 2001), pp 757-62. 105 See paragraph 13. 106 Ev 35, para 1.6 Evidence Check 2: Homeopathy 23 fund it\".107 The PCT concluded that homeopathy did not repres ent value for money and took the decision to cease fundi ng for TWHH. It now oper ates a policy \"not to fund routine homeopathy treatment\".108 85. We asked Dr James Thallon, Medical Director of NHS West Kent, whether the review could be replicated by other PCTs. He considered that: our process in terms of its quality and the way that it is done with scrutiny is a good roadmap for other organisations to adopt, and we would be very happy to act as a guide to other commissionin g organisations that wish to follow this path.109 We then asked Dr Thallon whether the DH should circulate the re view to other PCTs. He responded: I certainly do not th ink the issue of the decommis sioning of non- evidence based practice should be beneath the Departm ent of Health to help commissioning organisations with. Yes, I would have th ought there could well be a role for the Department of Health in helping other orga nisations get to the point we have got to should they choose to do so.110 Dr Thallon did, howev er, distinguish between PCTs with homeopathi c hospitals and those without: We are in a particular circumstance because there is a homeopathic hospital within our geographical locality and th at is why we had to go to th e lengths we did in order to prove the case, [...] to do th is in every localit y would be a divers ion of otherwise scarce resources.111 86. We were impressed with NHS West Kent's review of the commissioning of homeopathy and consid er that it provides a good model for other commissioning organisations, particularly those that fund homeopathic hospitals. We recommend that the Department of Health circulate NHS West Kent's review of the commissioning of homeopathy to those PCTs with homeopathic hospitals within thei r areas. It should recommend that they also conduct reviews as a matter of urgency, to determine whether spending money on ho meopathy is cost effective in the context of competing priorities. Should NICE evaluate homeopathy? 87. Another approach to aiding PCTs would be to have the Nati onal Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) evaluate homeopathy and produce guidance on whether it 107 Ev 34, para 1.4 108 Ev 37, para 7.1 109 Q 146 110 Q 147 111 Q 146 24 Evidence Check 2: Homeopathy should be commissioned. We heard several calls for NICE to evaluate homeopathy, including from the British Medical Association112 and the RPSGB.113 NICE told us that: Topics for guidance development are referred to NICE by the Secretary of State for Health, in line with national priorities established for the NHS\u2014for example; policy importance (i.e. whether th e topic falls within a gove rnment priority area) and whether there is inappropriate variat ion in practice across the country.114 88. We consider the issue of NICE evaluation important because it en sures patient safety and evidence-based practice. Ad ditionally there is variation in practice across the country with some PCTs fu nding homeopathy and others not. 89. We asked the Minister whether homeopathy should be evaluated by NICE and he responded: I have no objection to NICE evaluating this but they do have a couple of problems with it. Firstly, they have a large queue of drugs that they need to evaluate and there are greater priorities. Seco ndly, there is a somewhat limited evidential base and before evaluating things NICE want to see an evidential base, an d for the reasons we have already discussed it simply is not there at the moment.115 90. NICE takes the approach that if there is no good evidence for the efficacy or cost effectiveness of a treatment then the NHS should no t use it. This is based in part on the fact that scarce NHS resources shou ld be directed at those treatmen ts that have been shown to work in a cost-effective manner. We accept that NICE has a large queue of drugs to evaluate and that it may have greater priori ties than evaluating homeopathy. However, we cannot understand why the lack of an evidence base for homeopathy might prevent NICE evaluating it but not pr event the NHS spending money on it. This position is not logical. Homeopathy on the NHS 91. Discussions about patient satisf action, cost-benefit analyses and NICE's responsibilities do not resolve what we consider to be the central issue. We have already concluded that homeopathy acts as a placebo and we now co nsider whether the NH S should be funding placebo treatments. 92. The Government is clearly of the view that the NHS should be free to fund the use of placebo treatments like homeopat hy. The Minister told us that: [D]octors can, if they feel that there is an ethical and efficacious reason for doing so, prescribe a placebo. It may well be their view that that would assist a particular 112 Ev 194 113 Ev 3, para 2.04 114 Ev 187 115 Q 251 Evidence Check 2: Homeopathy 25 patient. I think they would hav e to think carefully about doing it, but I suspect they could probably justify that.116 93. In paragraph 38, we laid out a series of reasons why we might consider the use of placebos to be generally unethical. We shall consider each in turn. Integrity of the docto r-patient relationship 94. In order to maximise the impa ct of a placebo treatment, the doctor must deceive the patient, telling the patient that he or she is re ceiving a real treatment. The temptation to do so may be strong, as Dr Goldacre told us: [C]ircumstances might occur in which it could arguably be desirable to have the option of prescribing a placebo. There are often si tuations where an individual may want treatment, for example, but where medicine has little to offer\u2014lots of back pain, stress at work, medica lly unexplained fatigue, and most common colds, to give just a few examples. Going thro ugh a 'theatre' of medical treatment, and trying every medication in the book , will only risk side -effects. A harmless sugar pill in these circumstances may seem to be the sensible option.117 95. It was the Minster wh o most succinctly voiced our concerns about such a practice: I would not be happy to be mi sled and I suspect most pati ents would not. However, that was not the question you asked me. Wh at you were asking me [...] was whether it would be unethical for a doctor ever to prescribe a placebo. [...] I thought about it and I took the view that there might be cir cumstances, but would you generally do it? Of course you would not.118 96. We asked Dr Thallon his opinion and he told us: I struggle with the noti on that it is ethical to prescribe placebos. I am not saying that it does not happen; I think th at a number of the ways in which people behave or prescribe could be de scribed as prescribing placebos but, in principle, if you prescribe a drug which you kn ow to have no clinical effi cacy on a basis which is essentially dishonest with a patient, I pe rsonally feel that that is unethical behaviour.119 97. When doctors prescribe placebos, they risk damaging the trust that exists between them and their patients. Patient choice 98. Patient choice is an import ant concept in modern medicine . Medical practice used to be highly paternalistic, wher eby the doctors would know what was best for patients and 116 Q 190 117 Ev 9 118 Q 193 119 Q 120 26 Evidence Check 2: Homeopathy would prescribe whatever treatments they felt best. Today, do ctors are trained to communicate with pati ents about their trea tments and, while providing advice and guidance, ultimately enable patients to make informed choices, where possible, over treatment options and more control over the management of their conditions. 99. Indeed, patient choice was repeatedly cited in written submissions as a reason why homeopathy should be provided on the NHS.120 The Minister stated: I think there is an illiberality in saying that personal choice in an area of significant medical controversy sh ould be completely denied, and I think the Government should be cautious about constraining that illiberality, or inter fering with it. We should not take the view that patients should not be able to have homeopathic medicine when th ey want it.121 100. However, patient choice is not simply abou t patients being able to pick whatever treatments they like. They mu st understand the implication s of their decisions, which means that patient choice must be informed choice . As Professor Ernst put it: \"patient choice that is not guid ed by evidence is not choice but ar bitrariness\".122 The RPSGB echoed this view: It is essential [...] that the patient is give n the appropriate infor mation to make these informed choices and as a consequence it should be clear to the patient that there is no scientific evide nce for homeopathy.123 101. We agree with Professo r Ernst and the RPSGB. For patient choice to be real choice, patients must be adeq uately informed to understand the implic ations of treatments. For homeopathy this would ce rtainly require an explanatio n that homeopathy is a placebo. When this is not do ne, patient choice is meaning less. When it is done, the effectiveness of the placebo\u2014that is, homeopathy\u2014may be diminished. We argue that the provision of homeopathy on the NHS, in effect, diminishes, not increases, informed patient choice. Personal health budgets 102. In this context, we raised th e issue of the DH's announcement in 2009 of a pilot to test personal health budgets as a way of giving people greater co ntrol over the services they use.124 As part of this scheme, pati ents might be able to use thei r personal health budget to spend NHS money on complementary therapies such as homeopathy.125 103. We asked whether, through personal health budgets, the Government would be encouraging people to spend NHS money on homeopathy, the Minister replied: 120 For example , Ev 140 [Society Ev 151 [Alliance of Registered Homeopaths], para 4 121 Q 248 122 Q 161 123 Ev 3, para 1.11 124 \"Personal He alth Budgets\", Department of Health, www.dh.gov.uk 125 \"Personal budge ts to allow patients to buy homeopathy a nd acupuncture\", Pulse , 30 October 2009 Evidence Check 2: Homeopathy 27 It would depend to some extent on two fact ors. First, there has to be an agreement on the health package with a GP. Let us say, for the sake of your argument, there was a GP who believed in homeopathy and, therefor e, thought this was the right thing to do. Secondly, there wo uld have to be a PCT who was prepared to fund that. There would have to be the agreement of three parties, in effect: the patient, the doctor (the GP) and the PCT. All would have to agree th at that funding would be forthcoming for homeopathy. In theory it is possible. Is it going to happen in the next few years? No. Is it possible it could happen in the lo ng term? Theore tically yes, but you would have to get the three to agree.126 104. As we understand it, to g et homeopathy on the NHS today, the agreement of patient, GP and PCT is already necessary. We fail to see how th is arrangement would change with the introduction of personal health budgets : the PCT will continue to have a veto over provision of homeopathy. In our view, the Government should proh ibit access to non- evidence-based treatments if it introduces pers onal health budgets. We see no convincing reason to allow patients to spend public mone y on placebos such as homeopathy. We also recognise the problem that allowing NHS fund ing to be spent on non-efficacious and non- cost effective treatmen ts means that NHS mone y cannot be spent on efficacious and cost- effective treatments. We recommend that if personal health budget s proceed beyond the pilot stage the Government should not al low patients to b uy non-evidence-based treatments such as homeop athy with public money. Risk of harm to patients 105. The central aim of medi cine is making people better. While placebos may be effective at relieving symptoms (for ex ample, pain), they cannot tr eat the underlying cause of symptoms (for example, broken bones). There is a risk that a pa tient whose symptoms improve following homeopathic treatment (bec ause of a placebo effect or because the symptom would have diminished un aided) may delay seeking pr oper medical diagnosis for future symptoms th at may or may not be fo r a serious underlying condition. Tracey Brown, Managing Director of Sense About Science, pointed out that: there is the issue that even minor condit ions can sometimes be tray a more serious condition. For example, constipation. It sounds harmless to be taking sugar pills for constipation, but actually so metimes that is a symptom of a more serious condition and diagnosis is ne cessary. So there is the possibility of delayed diagn osis or people believing that they are seeking effective treatment when they are not.127 106. We are aware that large nu mbers of the public may not be aware what homeopathy really is. Sense About Science, which is a ch arity promoting scienc e and evidence for the public, has monitored public percepti ons of homeopathy. In thei r written submission they told us: In 2006 we reviewed discus sion about homeopathy an d made two observations: 126 Qq 215-16 127 Q 27 28 Evidence Check 2: Homeopathy a) That it was believed to co ntain an active ingredient, and was often confused with herbal medicine (and, related to this, that people were of ten unaware of the mystical belief in water memory and in 'like cures like' on which it is based). b) That because it was supplie d on the National Health Ser vice, it was a ssumed that it 'must be effective' and 'there must be something in it'.128 The charity added that it had come across clinicians and researchers who reported that it was \"hard to argue against something that was supplied throug h the NHS and that appeared to be offi cially endorsed\".129 107. We find this worrying. Pa tients who do not seek me dical advice from properly qualified doctors run th e risk of missing seri ous underlying conditio ns while they have their symptoms treated with a placebo. 108. These are not merely hypothetical concerns. Professor John McLachlan, Professor of Medical Education at the Unive rsity of Durham, highlighted in his written submission several cases where children had died as a result of their pa rents rejecting conventional treatments, including for treata ble conditions like diabetes.130 He alerted us to a case in Australia, where a homeopath an d his wife were charged wi th manslaughter by gross criminal negligence when their baby daughter died after they continually treated her with homeopathic remedies instead of conventional medicine . The baby died from eczema which, when left insuff iciently treated, deplet ed her immune system.131 In the UK, the General Medical Counci l found a doctor guilty of professi onal misconduct after he advised a patient to use only ho meopathic remedies. The pat ient subsequently died.132 109. When the NHS funds homeopa thy, it endorses it. Si nce the NHS Constitution explicitly gives pe ople the right to expect that decisions on th e funding of drugs and treatments are made \"f ollowing a proper consideration of the evidence\", patients may reasonably form the view that home opathy is an eviden ce-based treatment. Conclusions 110. The Government's position on homeopathy is confused. On the one hand, it accepts that homeopathy is a placebo treatment. This is an evidence-based view. On the other hand, it funds homeopathy on the NHS without taking a view on the ethics of providing placebo treatments. We argue that this unde rmines the relationship between NHS doctors and their patients, reduces real patient ch oice and puts patien ts' health at risk. The Government should stop allowing th e funding of homeopathy on the NHS. 111. We conclude that placebos should not be routinely prescribed on the NHS. The funding of homeopathic hospitals\u2014hospitals th at specialise in th e administration of 128 Ev 6, para 2.1 129 Ev 7, para 2.3 130 Ev 101, para 8 131 \"Parents guilty of manslaughter over daughter's eczema death\", The Sydney Morning Herald , 5 June 2009 132 \"Alternative cure doctor suspended\", BBC News , 29 June 2007 Evidence Check 2: Homeopathy 29 placebos\u2014should not continue, and NHS doctors should not refer patients to homeopaths. 30 Evidence Check 2: Homeopathy 3 MHRA licensing 112. Our inquiry also looked at the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) licensing regimes fo r homeopathic products. The policy 113. We started with the MHRA's purpose. It declares boldly on its website: \"What we regulate: Medicines.\"133 It continues: Whether it's a medicine you bu y, or one prescribed for yo u as part of a course of treatment, it's reassuring to know that all medicine s available in the UK are subject to rigorous scrutiny by the MH RA before they can be used by patients. This ensures that medicines meet acceptable standa rds on safety, qual ity and efficacy.133 114. Normally, medicines are licens ed by the MHRA as follows: To begin the process, companies and/or researchers must appl y to the MHRA for permission to test drugs through clinical trials, if these trials are to be conducted in the UK; All the test results from these trials on how well the medicine works and its side effects, plus details of what the medicine contains, how it works in the body, and who it is meant to treat, are then sent to the MHRA for detaile d assessment; and Once the MHRA is sa tisfied that the medicine works as it should, an d that it is acceptably safe, it is given a marketi ng authorisation or product licence.134 115. Homeopathic products are not subject to this process. As we explained in the previous chapter, homeopathy has a long tr adition of use in the UK and homeopathic products were available before a comprehensive regulatory system was introduced. There are currently three licensing regimes in operation for which the MH RA has varying degrees of responsibility. First, the Medicines Ac t 1968, which required medicines to be licensed before being allo wed onto the UK market , led to Product Licences of Right (PLRs) being automatically issued to all products alread y on the market when th e Act was implemented in 1971.135 Products with PLRs were allowed to stay on the market with their medical indications attached to them.136 116. Second, in 1992, the Simp lified Scheme for homeopat hic medicinal products was introduced under European Dire ctive 92/73/EC. There is no requirement in the Directive (and therefore in the Simplifie d Scheme) for data to demonstra te clinical efficacy of the product. The scheme is regarded as simplified because its purpose is to ensure the safety 133 \"What we regulate: Medicines\", Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency , www.mhra.gov.uk 134 \"Medicines and Medical Devices Regulation: What you need to know\", Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency , April 2008, pp 5-6 135 Ev 60 [Professor Woods] 136 Q 210 [Professor Woods] Evidence Check 2: Homeopathy 31 and quality of products , not efficacy. Pr oducts certified under the Simplified Scheme are not permitted to make medical claims.137 117. Third, in 2006, the MHRA sought to addres s inconsistencies in homeopathic product licensing, where products with PLRs could make medical cl aims and produc ts certified under the Simplified Scheme could not.138 Following a public consul tation (MLX 312), the MRHA introduced the National Rules Scheme (NRS), the purpose of which, according to the MHRA website, is to enable homeopathic me dicinal products to be regist ered with indications for the relief or treatment of mino r symptoms and conditions (tho se that can ordinarily be relieved or treated without th e supervision or in tervention of a do ctor). Applications under the National Rules Scheme must be su pported by a dossier of data on quality, safety and efficacy, together with app ropriate product la belling and product literature.139 Our expectations of the evidence base 118. On the basis of these licensing arrangements for homeopathic products it is clear to us that the \"rigorous scrutiny\" on safety, qualit y and efficacy applied by the MHRA before medicines can be used by patient s does not apply to homeopat hic products. Indeed, in its response to our evidence check questions th e Government stated that the \"three elements of the licensing regime pr obably lie outside the scope of [the] Inquiry , because government consideration of sc ientific evidence was not the basis for their establishment\".140 It explained: Firstly, the Product Licences of Right were granted to all existing marketed medicines in 1971, unde r the provisions of th e Medicines Act 1968. Secondly, the Simplified Scheme derives from European Directive 92/73/EC, so probably lies outside the scope of the Inquiry; and Thirdly, no scientific evidence was examin ed in drawing up the National Rules Scheme, which also derives from a European Direct ive. Definitions of 'product safety' and 'product quality' are commo nly understood and did not need to be embedded in the scheme itself. Therefore, the onus to provide supportive scientific evidence is on each individu al product that manufacture rs put through the scheme\u2014 to demonstrate that the product is used as a homeopat hic medicine, that it is safe, and that it is of suitable quality.141 119. We cannot accept this approach. First, the MHRA, as a regula tory agency, has a responsibility to scrutinise th e safety and quality of the me dicines and healthcare products that it licenses, and to scrutinise the efficacy of products which make any medical claims 137 \"Homoeopathic Medicines\", Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency , www.mhra.gov.uk 138 As above 139 As above 140 Ev 60 141 As above 32 Evidence Check 2: Homeopathy (medical indications). Where there is no evidence of efficacy, or scrutiny of efficacy, we question whether products should make cl aims or indeed be subject to any MHRA processes or endorsement.142 Second, there are three licens ing regimes\u2014the old PLR, the NRS and normal medi cinal licensing\u2014which permit or have permitted medical claims. When the MHRA allows claims to be made we would expect all their licensing approaches to be based on the process outlined in paragr aph 114, that is, the same process (requiring evidence of effica cy) that medicines permit ted to make medical in dications would undergo. Both of these issues feed th rough to the labelling of homeopathic products, which enable informed choice. Third, the NR S process places an \"onus to provide supportive scientific evidence [...] on each individual product that manufacturers put th rough the scheme\", which creates the expectation that the MHRA will review the basis of this evidence. 120. The continuation of the PLR scheme is problematic as it allows medical claims to be made. When consulting on wh ether to introduce the NRS in 2006, the MHRA explained that: It was intended to review PLR s against current standards of quality safety and efficacy. In 1973, the UK join ed the EU, European legislation came into force and the review of PLRs be came mandatory. By the time of the Review it became obvious that proof of efficacy fo r homeopathic products would be difficult if clinical trials were required and ho meopathics were therefore, exempted from the review and PL Rs remain in force. Currently almost 3,000 PLRs are extant.143 The Government has told us th at PLR licences are next due for review in September 2013 as legislation requires PLRs to be reviewed over a seven- year-period from 1 September 2006 (following the introduction of the NRS).144 121. We are concerned that homeopathic pr oducts were, and continued to be, exempted from the requirement for evidence of efficacy and have been allowed to continue holding Product Licences of Ri ght. We recommend that no PLRs for homeopathic products are renewed beyond 2013. User-testing of labels for homeopathic products 122. As we outlined in the previous chapter, patien t choice is not real choice unless it is informed. The DH, in its written submis sion to this inquiry, stated that: The Government takes the vi ew that consumers who ch oose to use homeopathic medicines should be fully informed ab out their purpose.145 142 In this Evidence Check the sa fety and quality of homeopathic products are not examined as (1) it is unlikely that water and sugar pills can be directly unsafe and (2) efficacy is the primary consideration of our Evidence check. 143 \"Consultation Document MLX 312; Li censing of homeopathics: Proposals for a new Nationa l Rules Scheme and for a review of Product Licences of Right\", Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, 20 June 2005 144 Innovation, Universities, Sc ience and Skills Committee, Ni nth report of Session 2008-09, Putting Science and Engineering at the Heart of Government Policy: Governmen t Response to the Innovation, Universities, Science and Skills Committee's Eighth Report of Session 2008-09 , HC 1036, p 4 Evidence Check 2: Homeopathy 33 Our expectation is that be ing \"fully informed\" requires the consumer to have an understanding of the content and efficacy of the homeopat hic product and, moreover, not to be misled by the label. Therefore we would expect user-testing of labels for homeopathic products to test whether th e participants could determ ine from the label that: the product did not cont ain any active ingred ient (or contai ned only a few molecules); and the product was not proven to be efficacious in the treatment of any medical complaint. The Evidence Check Evidence of efficacy 123. In Chapter 2 we reached the co nclusion that homeopathy was not efficacious and any perceived effectiveness was in fact solely due to the placeb o effect. When we took oral evidence from Professor Wood s, Chief Executive of the MHRA, we asked his view on the efficacy of homeopathy and he responded: One has to look at the totality of the evide nce and in my view there is no single piece of evidence that gives that reassurance. [...] In aggregate I do not think there is anything there that one would take as robust evidence of an effect over and above the placebo effect.146 124. Professor Woods claimed that the MHRA does not seek evidence of efficacy under the NRS147 yet the MHRA's guidance on the NRS states: The applicant must subm it data on the effica cy of the product which is the subject of the application.148 The guidance continues: It should be noted that re sults of clinical trials ar e not required to support applications for marketing au thorizations under the National Rules Scheme. However, the applicant must provide one or more of the following: Study reports in relation to the product which is the subject of the application; Published scientific literature; Homeopathic provings.149 125. The RPSGB expressed concern that \"homeopathic literature can be used as evidence for medical claims despi te the fact that it may not have be en subjected to the same level 145 Ev 63, para 31 146 Q 182 147 Qq 227-28 148 \"The Homeopathic National Rules Scheme: Brief Guidance for Manufacturers and Suppliers\", Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency , 2006 149 As above 34 Evidence Check 2: Homeopathy peer review as more main st ream scientific literature\".150 It added that \"the reliance on such evidence for homeopathic preparations is in stark contrast to th e stringent tests that conventional medicines must undergo prior to obtaining a licence\".151 We share the RPSGB's concerns about the ev idence that the MHRA accept s in assessing homeopathic products under the NRS. As we made clear in the preceding chapter, homeopathic provings do not provide a sound evidence base for efficacy. Indeed, when we asked Robert Wilson, Chairman of the Br itish Association of Homeopathic Ma nufacturers (BAHM), whether he replie d: \"No, a homeopathic proving is a technical term for when homeopat hic medicines are assessed. It is not a way of doing a trial.\"152 126. We asked Professor Woods why the MHRA accepted provings as evidence. He responded: They are not accepted as evide nce of efficacy: they are accepted as evidence that this is a product used by homeopaths with in the homeopathic tradition for that indication. It does no t mean to say we endo rse that indication; it is simply a marker that that product is used within the homeopathic community for the purpose for which the homeopath wishes to use it.153 127. On the basis of Professor Woods' evidence, we found the reference in the NRS's guidance to efficacy mi sconceived and confusin g. In our view the juxtap osition of efficacy with provings could establish an implication that homeopath ic provings are acceptable as evidence of efficacy, which is unsupported by the evidence . The MHRA subj ects neither homeopathic products nor prov ings to the analysis it applie s to conventional medicines. Given that homeopathic produc ts are pills that consist of sugar an d water we cannot see how the MHRA could apply credible scientific assessments of effica cy that showed any result other than th e placebo effect. 128. The absence of a requirement to show evidence of effica cy means that the MHRA's current arrangements wou ld allow a person to seek, for example, a licence for a confectionary product as long as he or she persuaded a number of people that it was a homeopathic product with therapeutic effects. Such a development would, rightly, bring the licensing arrangements into disrepute. We are concerned that the la ck of rigour in the MHRA's licensing processes by, for example, allowing the use of provings is allowing homeopathic products to build medical claims unsu pported by any evidence. We conclude that the MHRA should seek evidence of e fficacy to the same standard for all the products examined for licensing which make medical claims and we recommend that the MHRA remove all re ferences to homeopathic provings from its guidance other than to make it clear th at they are not e vidence of efficacy. 150 Ev 2, para 1.06 151 As above 152 Q 36 153 Q 212 Evidence Check 2: Homeopathy 35 The purpose of the National Rules Scheme 129. Given that the NRS is not base d on evaluating or assuring the efficacy of homeopathic treatments we probed what purpose the NR S served. In 2006, th e MHRA recommended to Government the introduction of the NRS in response to European Directive 2001/83. Ms Brown from Se nse About Science explained that: the EC Directive ma kes provision for national ag encies to introduce their own national rules. Under the EC Directive it would have b een perfectly acceptable to require homeopathic products to go through the same licensing procedures as other products if they wanted to make medicinal claims, so it was not the only option.154 130. The MHRA held a public consu ltation (MLX 312) prior to introducing the scheme. The MHRA invited responses to their basic proposals for the NRS as well as the four possible options for ha ndling existing PLRs: Option 1: Do nothing; Option 2: Revoke all PLRs, forcing products to apply fo r licences under the Simplified Scheme or new NRS; Option 3: Revoke all PLRs and force products to apply for licences under the new NRS; and Option 4: Renew and keep PLRs (reviewing those for more serious conditions), while encouraging companies to consider applying for new licences instead.155 131. Ms Brown told us: from a public health point of view none of these options has a rationale in terms of public health, they all have a rationale in terms of the in dustry, [...] So that is why they preferred option four\u2014 it allowed indications and le velled the playing field for the industry; there was no other justification.156 132. We noted that some consult ation respondents (including those classed by the MHRA as supportive of the scheme) were concer ned about the lack of evidence behind homeopathy and the introduction of a scheme that would permit medical indications.157 In response to this concern the MHRA stated: The National Rules scheme does not en dorse clinical effica cy of homeopathic products, as clinical effica cy is understood in the context of conventional pharmaceutica l medicines.158 133. The MLX 312 consultation document explained that: 154 Q 46 155 \"Consultation Document MLX 312; Li censing of homeopathics: Proposals for a new Nationa l Rules Scheme and for a review of Product Licences of Right\", Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, 20 June 2005 156 Q 50 157 Ev 77-89 158 As above 36 Evidence Check 2: Homeopathy Our proposals will be nefit both the ge neral public, by strengthening th e public health protection of users of homeopathic medicina l products and the homeopathic industry by levelling the playing field and increasing the range of products that can be marketed. The associated increase in costs for MHRA and the homeopathic industry are offset against th e benefits outlined above. The risk of leaving th ings is that th e expansion of the homeop athic industry will be inhibited by the prevention of the develo pment of new products with indications.159 134. Yet when we asked Professo r Woods whether th e NRS was introduc ed to facilitate the growth of the homeopathic industry, he responded: No, and, if it were, it has failed beca use since the National Rule Scheme was introduced we have exactly one prod uct registered under it since 2006.160 135. We have two concerns about the consul tation (MLX 312) which led to the introduction of the NRS. First, although derived from an EC Di rective, the MHRA had some freedom to design the regulatory regime. It could have pursued the logical route of requiring evidence of efficacy for products whose labelling could make medica l claims, or what would be perceived by the public to be medical claims, to be in line with the requirement for medical products . Second, respondents' concer ns about lack of evidence behind homeopathy were largely brushed aside. Having looked at the evidence we fail to understand why the MHRA th rew away the opportunity, wh en formulating the NRS for homeopathic produc ts, to make efficacy supported by clinical evidence a requirement before medical claims were allowed. We consider that the MH RA's consultation, which led to the introduction of the NRS, was flawed and we remain unconvinced that the NRS was designed with a pu blic health rationale. Labelling of homeopathic products 136. The MHRA licensing regim e regulates what can be wr itten on the label of a homeopathic product. Dr Goldacre considered that: The MHRA approved label on ho meopathy sugar pills is mi sleading. A great deal of effort has gone into making patient literature, leaflets , and labels more easily understood, explaining the be nefits and risks of treatm ents clearly, so it seems perverse and anomalous that the MHRA have settled on a plainly misleading convention for labelling these homeopathic sugar pills. The MHRA may deploy sophistry, or invoke technical readings of the statem ents, but the pu blic read these labels as saying that the homeopathic su gar pills are effective for the conditions listed.161 159 \"Consultation Document MLX 312; Li censing of homeopathics: Proposals for a new Nationa l Rules Scheme and for a review of Product Licences of Right\", Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, 20 June 2005 160 Q 210 161 Ev 9 Evidence Check 2: Homeopathy 37 137. Currently, under the Simplifie d Scheme, homeopathic produc t labels must include the phrase \"Homeopathic medicinal product without ap proved therapeu tic indications\".162 We asked Professor Woods about th e labelling on Arnica Mont ana 30C, the only product currently granted a licence under the NRS. Professor Woods explained that: The descriptor on the pack et says [...]: 'A homeopathic medicinal product used within the homeopathic tradition for the symptomatic relief of sprains, muscular aches, bruising and swe lling'. That is what we wish to confirm and this is used within the homeopathic traditio n for that purpose. It is not the same as us accepting it as evidence.163 138. We have two concerns about this label. First, the mere use of a product in the homeopathic tradition, withou t any actual evidence of ef ficacy, does not provide any information as to whether a pr oduct actually works, and th erefore is a poor basis for allowing medical indications on a product la bel. Second, we are co ncerned about how the public would interp ret the label. We asked Professor Woods whether the average person would conclude from th e labelling that the pr oduct worked for symptomatic relief of the listed minor conditions or whet her they would realise there was no evidence of efficacy. He replied: [B]y law all packaging and patient informatio n leaflets are subjected to user testing to ensure that they are compre hensible to the man in the st reet, and indeed that seems to be a very straightfor ward statement of the reality. This is a home opathic medicinal product used within the homeopathic traditio n for the symptomatic relief of sprains, muscular aches and bruising or swelling after contusions. That is what it says and the user testing is part of the app roval of that leaflet, has the labelling been tested on the average man in the street.164 139. We were not reassured by this answer and so we requested furthe r information on the MHRA's user testing of the Arnica Montana 30C produc t label. The MHRA explained in a supplementary memorandum that as part of th e label testing on Arn ica, they carried out three rounds of user tests, in each round asking 10 participants a set of questions.165 The questions include d the following: a) What does the label say that this medicine is for? b) What does the label say is the acti ve ingredient in this medicine? c) This medicine contains Arnica Montana 30C. What are the other ingredients in this medicine? 140. In our view, these questions are problematic. Questi on a) implies that the product can be used to treat the ailment in question. Questions b) and c) imply to participants that there is an active in gredient. On the evidence of these qu estions it appears to us that the 162 \"UK Homeopathic Registration and National Rules Scheme Guidance Notes: note on labelling requirements for homeopathic products\", Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency , 2009 163 Q 227 164 Q 229 165 Ev 90 38 Evidence Check 2: Homeopathy MHRA is encouraging participants in the survey to come to the conclusion that the product contains an active in gredient that can be used to provide relief of sprains, muscular aches and bruising or swelling after co ntusions, which is contrary to what Professor Woods told us was the intention and effect of the label. On the assumption that this is what most of the participants concluded we fail to see why th e label test design should be acceptable to th e MHRA given that, first, it considers that homeopathic products have no effect beyond placebo an d, second, Arnica Montana 30C contains no active ingredient and there is no scientific ev idence that it has been demonstrated to be efficacious. We conclude that the user-testing of the Arnica Montana 30C label was poorly designed with parts of the test active ly misleading particip ants. In our view the MHRA's testing of the public's understanding of the labelling of homeopathic products is defective. 141. As a Committee we are strong advocates of evidence-based deci sion-making and we are firmly of the view that members of th e public should have the opportunity to make evidence-based decisi ons about their health. It follows that all patients should be informed about the lack of evidence of ef ficacy for homeopathic products , most crucially at the point of sale, so that they can make an informed ch oice. The current labelling arrangements fail to provide patients with the information to make informed choices about homeopathic products. If the MHRA is to continue to regulate the labelling of homeopathic products, which we do not support, we re commend that the tests are redesigned to ensure and demonstrate through user testing that pa rticipants clearly un derstand that the products contain no active ingredients and are unsupported by ev idence of efficacy, and the labelling should not mention sympto ms, unless the same standard of evidence of efficacy used to as sess conventional medicines has been met. The role of pharmacies 142. Homeopathic products are available to buy over-the-counter in pharmacies, which provide advice to many enquiring ab out homeopathic products. Pharmacists are required to provide advice on complemen tary therapies and medicine s, in accordance with guidance from the RPSG B, particularly the Professional Standards and Guidance for the Sale and Supply of Medicines , which advises pharmacists: You must ensure that you ar e competent in any area in which yo u offer advice on treatment or medicines. If yo u sell or supply homeopath ic or herbal medicines, or other complementary therapies, you must: 1) assist patients in ma king informed decis ions by providing th em with necessary and relevant information 2) ensure any stock is obtain ed from a re putable source 3) recommend a remedy on ly where you can be satisfie d of its safety and quality, taking into account the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency registration schemes for home opathic and herbal remedies.166 166 \"Professional Standards a nd Guidance for the Sale a nd Supply of Medicines\", Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain , April 2009, para 8 Evidence Check 2: Homeopathy 39 143. Boots is the leading pharmacy chain in the UK and is a we ll recognised retailer and brand. The pharmacy sect ion of Boots sells a range of complementary and alternative medicines, including homeopat hic products. We asked Pa ul Bennett, Professional Standards Director at Boots, why they sold homeopathic products. Mr Bennett replied: It is about consumer choice for us. A larg e number of our consu mers actually do believe they are efficacious, but they are license d medicinal products and, therefore, we believe it is right to make them available.167 144. Beyond the issue of consumer choice, Professor Lawrence, Chief Scientific Adviser for the RPSGB, considered there were reason s why pharmacies shou ld continue to sell homeopathic products: We would contest it is better for the pa tient for pharmacists to be present [...] because they are able, if appropriate, to offer advice to that patient, and there are two things that are important. It is important that patients should realise there is not any evidence for the particular preparations and, also, it gives the pharmacist an opportunity to ensure that the patient is not actually taking something unnecessary. 168 We found this response unsatisfactory. As the RPSGB takes the view that \"there is no scientific or clinical evid ence to suppor t homeopathy\"169 the only advice pharmacists could give is that the produc ts are placebos. Pharmacists shou ld ensure that patients with symptoms that may require fur ther medical investig ation and treatment are not led to believe that a homeopat hic remedy is effective beyond th e placebo effect. The RPSGB itself has described pharmacists as \"s cientists in th e high street\"170 and therefore has a particular responsibility to ensure that pharmacists pro vide scientifically accura te advice to patients. 145. The RPSGB had concerns about the possibly legitimisation of homeopathy caused by the sale of products through pharmacies. It pointed out in its writ ten submission that: the current Government policy of al lowing indications for homeopathic preparations intended for over the coun ter sale, may be seen to legitimising the practice of homeopathy an d may prompt some patient s to use, for example, homeopathic preparations fo r malaria prophylaxis, treatm ent of HIV, TB, influenza, childhood diarrhoea or in place of im munisation.171 146. Although the availability of homeopathic products in pharm acies could be interpreted by patients as an endorsement of efficacy, in our view it would be pointless to seek to remove homeopathic products from sale in pharmacies. Ma ny pharmacies se ll ranges of non-evidence-based products an d homeopathic products are easily available over the internet in any case. We consider that the way to deal wi th the sale of homeopathic 167 Q 5 168 Q 60 169 Ev 5, para 3.10 170 For example, \"Scientist in the High Street campaign: factsheets\", Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain , www.rpsgb.org 171 Ev 3, para 1.12 40 Evidence Check 2: Homeopathy products is to remove any medical claim an d any implied endorsement of efficacy by the MHRA\u2014other than wh ere its evidential standards us ed to assess conventional medicines have been met\u2014and for the labelling to make it explicit that there is no scientific evidence that homeopathic prod ucts work beyond the placebo effect. Enforcement of the RPSGB's guidelines 147. We asked Professor Lawrence how the RPSGB became aware of breaches of Professional Standard s and Guidance for the Sale and Su pply of Medicines. She explained that: One of them is through the Society's insp ectorate which visits the shops on an occasional basis, and one of their roles is to check that the pharmacists are adhering to ethical guidelines.172 The other way is from complaints from perhaps a member of the public.173 148. We also asked Profes sor Lawrence how pharmacies br eaching the RPSGB's guidelines were disciplined. In 2006, a BBC Newsnight investiga tion revealed that some homeopathic pharmacies were claiming that their products could treat malaria, in place of conventional anti-malarial drugs.174 Professor Lawrence was not able to tell us whether th is investigation had concluded.175 We are concerned that the investigation of a case that began in 2006 is taking so long to resolve. 149. Concerns were raised that thes e were not isolated cases. Dr Andy Lewi s told us, in his written evidence, that: Homeopathic pharmacies are fu ll of products with direc t and implied claims. [...] Visiting a homeopathic phar macy website will show many products with implied indications. [...] The remedy li sts of Ainsworths show prod ucts for each Influenza strain going back 20 years. You will fi nd homeopathic replac ements for Measles vaccine, and Rubella. You find home opathic sugar pills for all forms of Hepatitis, strains of TB, and Typhoid.176 150. We asked Professor Lawrence if she could assure us that phar macies are not selling homeopathic anti-mal arial prophylaxis177 absence of conventional evidence-based prophylaxis and she replied: Obviously I cannot assure you that every ph armacy is not, but I can assure you that the pharmaceutical society has made it very clear to its members that it is completely inappropriate to use homeopathy for the treatment of malaria.178 172 Q 63 173 Q 64 174 \"Malaria advice 'risks lives'\", BBC Newsnight , 13 July 2006 175 Qq 69-70 176 Ev 118, para 9 177 Prophylaxis is preventative medicine. 178 Q 71 Evidence Check 2: Homeopathy 41 151. Although it goes wider than the scope of this Evidence Check inquiry we must put on record our concern about the length of time the RPSGB appears to be taking to investigate and reach conclusions on cases wher e it has been alleged that its guidelines on the sale of homeopathic products have been breach ed. We recommend that the Government enquires into whether the RP SGB, and from the 2010 handover, the General Pharmaceutical Council, is doing an adequate job in respect of the time taken to pursue complaints. Conclusions on the licensing regimes 152. The MHRA, with commendable frankness, told our inquiry that it does not consider that homeopathic medicines have efficacy beyond placebo. The evidence we received during this inquiry supports that conclusion. On that basis, the tests that the MHRA uses to assess non-homeopathic medi cal products would mean that no homeopathic products would be licensed by the MHRA. Instead of introducin g a blanket requirement for evidence of efficacy, the MHRA operates three licensing re gimes for homeopathic products, in part, for historical reasons and, in part, it appears, to support the homeopathic industry. It is unacceptable for th e MHRA to license placebo products\u2014in this case sugar pills\u2014conferring up on them some of th e status of medicines. Even if medical claims on labels are prohibit ed, the MHRA's licensing itself lends direct credibility to a product. Licensing paves the way for retail in pharmacies and consequently the patient's view of the credib ility of homeopathy may be further enhanced . We conclude that it is time to break this chain and, as the licensing regimes operated by the MHRA fail the Evidence Check, the MHRA should withdraw its discrete licensing schemes for homeopathic products. 42 Evidence Check 2: Homeopathy 4 Conclusions 153. This second Evidence Check has been an interestin g exercise, and qu ite different to Evidence Check 1: Early Literacy Interventions. By conducting th is inquiry we have attracted a great deal more public interest and controvers y and have found that views on homeopathy are more polarised. 154. We welcome the Government's acknowledgement that there is no cr edible evidence of efficacy for homeopathy, which is an evid ence-based view. Howev er, the Government's view has not translated into evidence-base d policies. 155. The NHS funds home opathy and has done so since 1948. We were disappointed that, in light of its view on evidence for homeopat hy, the Government has no appetite to review its policies in favour of an evidence-based approach. Th e Government was reluctant to address the issues of informed patient ch oice or the appropriateness and ethics of prescribing placebos to patients. 156. The MHRA licenses homeopathic products under th ree different licen sing schemes. These arrangements in part arose through a historical legacy inheri ted by the MHRA. We were concerned, however, that in introducing the National Rules Scheme in 2006, the MHRA chose not to take a r igorous, evidence-based approach to licensing of homeopathic products. The MHRA's justification for introd ucing a scheme permitting products to make medical indications\u2014that the prod uct labelling was st ringently tested to ensure patients would understand the purpose of th e product\u2014was not evidence-based. 157. By providing homeopathy on the NHS and allowing MHRA licensi ng of products which subsequently a ppear on pharmacy shelves, the Government runs the risk of endorsing homeopathy as an e fficacious system of medicine. To maintain patient trust, choice and safety, the Government should not endorse the use of placebo treatments, including homeopathy. Homeopathy should not be funded on the NHS and the MHRA should stop licensing homeopathic products. Evidence Check 2: Homeopathy 43 Conclusions and recommendations The policy on NHS funding and provision of homeopathy 1. We recommend that the Gover nment determine the total am ount of money spent by the NHS on homeopathy a nnually over the past 10 years, differentiating homeopathic products, patient referrals and maintenance and refurbishment of homeopathic hospitals, and publish the figures. (Paragraph 15) Our expectations of the evidence base 2. We consider that conclusions about the e vidence on the effi cacy of homeopathy should be derived from well designed an d rigorous randomised controlled trials (RCTs). (Paragraph 20) 3. We expect the conclusions on the evidenc e for the efficacy of homeopathy to give particular weight to properly conducted me ta-analyses and sys tematic reviews of RCTs. (Paragraph 25) 4. We have set out the issue of efficacy and effe ctiveness at some length to illustrate that a non-efficacious medic ine might, in some situations , be effective (patients feel better) because of the placebo effect. That is why we put more weight on evidence of efficacy than of effectiveness. (Paragraph 39) 5. We would expect the Govern ment to have a proper unde rstanding of the power and complexities of the placebo effect and the ethical issues surrou nding its use in a clinical setting; otherw ise it cannot hope to make good decisions rela ting to patients and public health. (Paragraph 40) 6. Our expectations of the evidence base re levant to government policies on the provision of homeopathy are straightforward. We would expect the Government to have a view on the efficacy of homeopathy so as to inform its policy on the NHS funding and provision of homeopathy. Such a view should be based on the best available evidence, that is, rigorous randomised controll ed trials and meta-analyses and systematic reviews of RCTs. If the effects of ho meopathy can be primarily attributed to the placebo ef fect, we would expect the Gove rnment to have a view on the ethics of prescribing placebos. (Paragraph 47) The evidence check: NHS funding and provision 7. We conclude that the principle of like-cur es-like is theoretically weak. It fails to provide a credible physi ological mode of action for homeopathic products. We note that this is the settled view of medical science. (Paragraph 54) 8. We consider the notion that ultra-dilutions can maintain an imprint of substances previously dissolved in th em to be scientifically im plausible. (Paragraph 61) 44 Evidence Check 2: Homeopathy 9. Research funding is limited and highly competitive. The Government should continue its policy of funding the highest quality applications for important scientific research determined on the basis of peer review. (Paragraph 63) 10. We recommend that the Government Chief Scientific Adviser an d Professor Harper, Chief Scientist at the DH, get together to see if they can reach an agreed position on the question of whether there is any me rit in research fun ding being directed towards the claimed modes of action of homeopathy. (Paragraph 64) 11. In our view, the systematic reviews and me ta-analyses conclusive ly demonstrate that homeopathic products perform no better than placebos. (Paragraph 70) 12. We recommend that the Government Chief Scientific Adviser an d Professor Harper get together to see if th ey can reach an agreed position on the question of whether there is any good evidence for the effica cy of homeopathy and whether there is a genuine scientific controve rsy over the efficacy of homeopathy and publish this. (Paragraph 72) 13. We regret that advocates of homeopathy, incl uding in their submissions to our inquiry, choose to rely on, and promulgate, selective approaches to the treatment of the evidence base as this risks confusing or misleadi ng the public, the media and policy-makers. (P aragraph 73) 14. There has been enough testing of homeopathy and plenty of evidence showing that it is not efficacious. Competition for research funding is fierce and we cannot see how further research on the efficacy of homeo pathy is justified in the face of competing priorities. (Paragraph 77) 15. It is also unethical to enter patients into trials to answ er questions that have been settled already. Given the dif ferent position on this important question between the Minister and his Chief Scientist, we recommend that the Government Chief Scientific Adviser, Professo r John Beddington, investigate whethe r ministers are receiving effective advice and publis h his own advice on this question. (Paragraph 78) 16. We do not doubt that homeo pathy makes some patients feel better. However, patient satisfaction can occur through a placebo e ffect alone and therefore does not prove the efficacy of homeopathic in terventions. (Paragraph 82) 17. We recommend that the Departm ent of Health circulate NH S West Kent's review of the commissioning of homeopathy to those PCTs with homeopathi c hospitals within their areas. It should reco mmend that they also cond uct reviews as a matter of urgency, to determine whether spending money on homeopat hy is cost effective in the context of competing pr iorities. (Paragraph 86) Should NICE evaluate homeopathy? 18. We accept that NICE has a large queue of drugs to ev aluate and that it may have greater priorities than evaluating home opathy. However, we ca nnot understand why the lack of an evidence base for homeopat hy might prevent NICE evaluating it but Evidence Check 2: Homeopathy 45 not prevent the NHS spending money on it. This position is not logical. (Paragraph 90) Homeopathy on the NHS 19. When doctors prescribe placebos, they risk damaging the trust th at exists between them and their patients. (Paragraph 97) 20. For patient choice to be real choice, pa tients must be adequately informed to understand the implications of treatments. For homeop athy this would certainly require an explanation that homeopathy is a placebo. When this is not done, patient choice is meaningless. When it is done, the effectiveness of the placebo\u2014that is, homeopathy\u2014may be diminished. We argue that the provision of homeopathy on the NHS, in effect, diminishes, not increases, informed patient choice. (Paragraph 101) 21. We recommend that if person al health budgets proceed beyond the pilot stage the Government should not allow patients to bu y non-evidence-based treatments such as homeopathy with public money. (Paragraph 104) 22. When the NHS funds homeopathy, it en dorses it. Since the NHS Constitution explicitly gives people the r ight to expect that decisions on the funding of drugs and treatments are made \"following a proper consideration of the evidence\", patients may reasonably form the view that homeopathy is an e vidence-based treatment. (Paragraph 109) 23. The Government should stop allowing the funding of homeopathy on the NHS. (Paragraph 110) 24. We conclude that placebos should not be routinely prescribed on the NHS. The funding of homeopathic hospitals\u2014hospitals th at specialise in th e administration of placebos\u2014should not continue , and NHS doctors should not refer patients to homeopaths. (Paragraph 111) Product Licences of Right 25. We are concerned that homeopathic produc ts were, and continued to be, exempted from the requirement for evidence of effi cacy and have been a llowed to continue holding Product Licences of Right. We recommend that no PLRs for homeopathic products are renewed beyond 2013. (Paragraph 121) The evidence check: licensing 26. We conclude that the MHRA should seek evidence of eff icacy to the s ame standard for all the prod ucts examined for licensing wh ich make medical claims and we recommend that the MHRA remo ve all references to homeopathic provings from its guidance other than to make it clear that they are not evidence of efficacy. (Paragraph 128) 46 Evidence Check 2: Homeopathy 27. We consider that the MHRA's consultation, which led to the introduction of the NRS, was flawed and we remain unconvinced that the NRS was designed with a public health rational e. (Paragra ph 135) 28. We fail to see why the label test design should be acceptable to the MHRA given that, first, it considers that ho meopathic products have no effect beyond placebo and, second, Arnica Montana 30C contains no active ingredient and there is no scientific evidence that it has been demonstrated to be efficacious. We co nclude that the user- testing of the Arnica Montan a 30C label was poor ly designed with parts of the test actively misleading parti cipants. In our view the M HRA's testing of the public's understanding of the labelling of homeopathic products is defective. (Paragraph 140) 29. If the MHRA is to continue to regulate the labelling of homeopathic products, which we do not support, we recommend that th e tests are redesign ed to ensure and demonstrate through user testing that pa rticipants clearly un derstand that the products contain no active ingredients and are unsupported by e vidence of efficacy, and the labelling should not mention sy mptoms, unless the same standard of evidence of efficacy used to assess conven tional medicines has been met. (Paragraph 141) The role of pharmacies 30. We consider that the way to deal with the sa le of homeopathic prod ucts is to remove any medical claim and any i mplied endorsement of ef ficacy by the MHRA\u2014other than where its evidential stan dards used to assess conven tional medicines have been met\u2014and for the labelling to make it explicit that there is no scientific evidence that homeopathic products work beyond th e placebo effect. (Paragraph 146) 31. Although it goes wider than the scope of this Evidence Check inquiry we must put on record our concer n about the length of time the RPSGB appears to be taking to investigate and reach conclusions on cases where it has been alleged that its guidelines on the sale of ho meopathic products have b een breached. We recommend that the Government enquires into wh ether the RPSGB, and from the 2010 handover, the General Pharmaceutical Coun cil, is doing an adeq uate job in respect of the time taken to pursue complaints. (Paragraph 151) Conclusions on the licensing regimes 32. It is unacceptable for the MHRA to licen se placebo products\u2014in this case sugar pills\u2014conferring upon them so me of the status of medici nes. Even if medical claims on labels are prohibited, th e MHRA's licensing itself lends direc t credibility to a product. Licensing paves the way for re tail in pharmacies and consequently the patient's view of the credibility of ho meopathy may be further enhanced. We conclude that it is time to break this chain and, as th e licensing regimes operated by the MHRA fail the Evidence Check, the MHRA should withdraw its discrete licensing schemes for homeopathi c products. (Par agraph 152) Evidence Check 2: Homeopathy 47 Overall conclusion 33. By providing homeopathy on the NHS and allowing MHRA licens ing of products which subsequently appear on pharmacy shelves, the Gove rnment runs the risk of endorsing homeopathy as an efficacious system of medicine. To mai ntain patient trust, choice and safety, the Government should not endorse the use of placebo treatments, including homeopathy. Homeop athy should not be funded on the NHS and the MHRA should stop licensing homeopat hic products.

The Committee divided. Ayes, 3 Mr Ian Cawsey Dr Evan Harris Dr Doug Naysmith Noes, 1Ian Stewart Paragraph agreed to. Evidence Check 2: Homeopathy 49 Paragraphs 78 to 157 read and agreed to. Summary brought up and read as follows: This inquiry, our second Evidence Check, asks whet her the Government's polic ies on the provision of homeopathy through the NHS and the licensing of homeopat hic products by the MHRA are evidence-based. It is not an evaluation of homeopathy itself. The Government does not consider that there is any cred ible evidence of efficacy for homeopathy, which, we found, to be an evidence-based view. That there is no pl ausible evidence to show that homeopathy is efficacious but there is a body of opinion that it is effective, means homeopathy fits the profile of a placebo, or dummy, treatment. While acknowledging the lack of evidence, the Government has not, however, based its policies on homeopathy being a placebo. Indeed, the Government is content to fence homeopathy off within the NHS and to place a \"keep out\" notice on the gate. We cannot accept this approach to the formulation or scrutiny of policy. Either homeopathy is an evidence-based treatment subject to the same tests as conventional treatments or it is a placebo and should therefore be subject to NHS policy on placebos. The problem is, however, that it appears the NHS has no policy on placebos. The placebo effect is unreliable and addresses symptoms not the causes of illness. The use of placebos also poses serious ethical issues as it partly relies on deception of patients. Speaking personally, the Minist er for Health Services cons idered the use of placebo treatments to be \"unethical\". We share his misgivings, as would most patients if th ey knew that the evidence showed, and the Government considered, homeopathy to be a placebo treatment. We conclude that homeopathy should therefore no longer be available on the NHS. Similar considerations applied when we examined the licensing of homeopathic products by the MHRA. Homeopathic products are regulated through three licensing schemes, none of which require evidence of clinical efficacy, yet two of the schemes permit medical indications on the label. The product la belling fails to inform the public that homeopathic products are sugar pills containing no active in gredients. The licensing regimes and deficient labelling lend a spurious me dical legitimacy to homeopathic prod ucts. We call for the MHRA to cease licensing homeopathic products. We conclude that the Government's policies on the provision of homeopat hy through the NHS and licensing of homeopathic products are not evidence-based. Indeed the policies run counter to the evidence. Question put That the summary be added to the Report. The Committee divided. Ayes, 1 Ian Stewart Noes, 3 Mr Ian Cawsey Dr Evan Harris Dr Doug Naysmith Summary disagreed to. Motion made, and Question put, That the Report be the Fourth Report of the Committee to the House.

Theprimary objectives of the Society are to lead, regulate, develop and represent the profession of pharmacy . The RPSGB leads and supports the development of the profession within the context of the public benet. This includes the advancement of science, practice, education and knowledge in pharmacy . In addition, itpromotes the profession's policies and views to a range of external stakeholders in a number of di Verent forums. Following the publication in 2007 of the Government White Paper Trust, Assurance and Safety\u2014The Regulation of Health Professionals in the 21st Century , the Society is working towards the demerger of its regulatory and professional roles. This will see the establishment of a new General Pharmaceutical Counciland a new professional body for pharmacy in 2010. The Society welcomes the opportunity to respond to the invitation of the House of Commons Science and Technology Committee to submit evidence to their enquiry on homeopathy . In this document the RoyalPharmaceutical Society has provided responses to the three issues highlighted by the Committee. Summary of Recommendations Recommendation 1: research needs to be undertaken to develop alternative and robust methodology to assess clinical interventions involving homeopathic treatments. Recommendation 2: unless or until such a time as e Ycacy of a homeopathic product can be proven using appropriate methodology (as for conventional medicines) claims of e Ycacy should be removed from the label of a homeopathic product. This recommendation includes any homeopathic products with PLR whenthey come up for review by the MHRA in the near future. Recommendation 3: Unless or until such a time as e Ycacy of a homeopathic product can be proven using appropriate methodology (as for conventional medicines) labelling on the homeopathic product shouldmake it very clear that the e Ycacy of the homeopathic preparation has not be proven. Recommendation 4: Patients are made aware of the fact that there is no scientic basis for the use of homeopathy . Recommendation 5: research should urgently be undertaken to determine how e Vective homeopathic remedies are and whether it is the whole package of care provided by homeopathic treatment that is benecial for the patient rather than the product per se . Recommendation 6: homeopathic remedies should be reviewed by NICE if they are to be used within the NHS to ensure that they give value for money and to ensure that the funding of conventional medicines isnot compromised by their use. Recommendation 7: the cost-benet ratio for homeopathic interventions should be established. Recommendation 8: if homeopathy continues to be made available on the NHS all homeopaths must be registered with an appropriate body and governed by a Code of Evidence Response 1.Government policy on licensing homeopathic products 1.01 Between 1971 and 2006 it was not possible to make a claim about e Vectiveness of a new homeopathic product, product registration was made solely on the basis of quality and safety . 1.02 The introduction of UK National Rules in September 2006 (as permissible under European legislation) allowed limited medical claims such as \"for the relief of....\" for new homeopathic preparationsprovided there is \"suitable evidence that the product has been used as a homeopathic treatment in theindications sought. Information provided should be in the form of provings, excerpts from homeopathicmaterial medica or other bibliographic data and should be su Ycient to demonstrate that homeopathic practitioners would accept the e Ycacy of the products for those indications\". 1.03 It should be noted that products registered under the UK National Rules are intended for over-the- counter sale and are indicated for the relief of self-limiting minor symptoms and minor conditions. For thesepurposes, minor symptoms are dened by the MHRA as those, which can ordinarily and with reasonablesafety , be relieved or treated without the supervision or intervention of a doctor. Serious conditions such asdiabetes, epilepsy , cancer and prevention and treatment of malaria are excluded from the scheme. 1.04 Signicantly the UK National Rules go against the ndings of the 2000 UK Parliamentary Select Committee on Science and Technology on complementary and alternative medicine in reported that \"anytherapy that makes specic claims for being able to treat specic conditions should have evidence of beingable to do this above and beyond the placebo e Vect\". 1.05 One consequence of the 2006 UK National Rules is that there is no requirement for rigorous clinical data to demonstrate e Ycacy of a new homeopathic medicine as is understood in the context of conventional pharmaceutical medicines where clinical e Ycacy is demonstrated using pre-clinical tests and clinical trials. 1.06 Homeopathic provings (ie where healthy volunteers are given the potential homeopathic substance to elicit the same symptoms as the illness that is to be treated) can now be used as evidence for medical claimsdespite the fact that they do not prove e Ycacy . Furthermore the homeopathic literature can also be used as evidence for medical claims despite the fact that it may not have been subjected to the same level peer reviewas more main stream scientic literature. The reliance on such evidence for homeopathic preparations is instark contrast to the stringent tests that conventional medicines must undergo prior to obtaining a licence. 1.07 When the UK joined the European Community in 1973, a review of all products covered by Product Licences of Right (PLR) awarded under the 1968 Medicines Act became mandatory . Many homeopathicproducts had been awarded Product Licences of Right (PLR) and were able to claim e Ycacy if the product had been previously used for this purpose. However, it was recognised by the regulatory authorities thatproviding proof of e Ycacy for homeopathic products would pose a di Yculty , and as a consequence homeopathic medicines were exempted from the review and many PLRs remain in place. The MHRA hashowever stated that it will review all PLR by 2013 and remove \"any unsuitable indications\", although undercurrent UK National Rules it is unlikely that many homeopathic preparations will not be granted licences. 1.08 The RPSGB is concerned that, under the current UK National Rules, the patient will not realise that the regulatory regime for homeopathic products is not the same as that for conventional pharmaceuticalmedicines and may understand the phrase \"for the relief of or treatment of.....\" on the label to imply anendorsement of e Ycacy (by the MHRA) where none has actually been proven. Indeed while it is acknowledged that homeopathic manufacturers are advised under National Rules to include a statementon all labels and product literature along the lines that \"A homeopathic medicinal product used within thehomeopathic tradition for the relief of or treatment of ....\" and a statement advising the consumer to consulta medical practitioner if symptoms persist, our concern is that this is not a clear enough message to thepatient. 1.09 The RPSGB believes that any medicinal claim for a product must be based on sound scientic and clinical evidence and that it is the duty of the regulatory authorities to ensure that no claims for e Ycacy for any form of a medicine (homeopathic or otherwise) are made unless there is good scientic and clinicalevidence for doing so. 1.10 It has long been claimed by the homeopathic community that current randomised controlled clinical trial methodology is inappropriate for assessing any benet arising from a homeopathic intervention(Weatherley et al Homeopathy (2004) 93, 186-189; Chanda and Furnham Focus on Alternative and Complementary Therapies (2008) 13, 157-167 ). Recommendation 1: research needs to be undertaken to develop alternative and robust methodology to assess clinical interventions involving homeopathic treatments Recommendation 2: unless or until such a time as e Ycacy of a homeopathic product can be proven using appropriate methodology (as for conventional medicines) claims of e Ycacy should be removed from the label of a homeopathic product. This recommendation includes any homeopathic products with PLR whenthey come up for review by the MHRA in the near future Recommendation 3: Unless or until such a time as e Ycacy of a homeopathic product can be proven using appropriate methodology (as for conventional medicines) labelling on the homeopathic product shouldmake it very clear that the e Ycacy of the homeopathic preparation has 3 1.11 The RPSGB recognises the UK Government view that consumers should be free to make informed choices that involve non-conventional approaches to the relief of certain symptoms or conditions. It isessential therefore that the patient is given the appropriate information to make these informed choices andas a consequence it should be clear to the patient that there is no scientic evidence for homeopathy(contrary to what is sometimes stated on homeopathic web-sites) and that the claims of e Ycacy made for homeopathic medicines (on their labels) are not made on the same stringent basis as conventional medicines. 1.12 The RPSGB is concerned that the current Government policy of allowing indications for homeopathic preparations intended for over the counter sale, may be seen to legitimising the practice ofhomeopathy and may prompt some patients to use, for example, homeopathic preparations for malariaprophylaxis, treatment of HIV , TB, influenza, childhood diarrhoea or in place of immunisation, practiceswhich have been condemned earlier this year by the WHO ( British Medical Journal (2009) 339, 479 ). Recommendation 4: Patients are made aware of the fact that there is no scientic basis for the use of homeopathy 2.Government policy on funding homeopathy through the NHS 2.01 The NHS currently supports 4 homeopathic hospitals in Bristol, London, Liverpool and Glasgow. Until March 2009 NHS patients could be referred to the homeopathic hospital in Tunbridge Wells. It isreported that the four NHS homeopathic hospitals currently treat 55,000 patients per year referred by GPs,PCTs and NHS specialists. In addition there are over 400 GP's practising homeopathy and who are regulatedby the GMC and are members of the Faculty of Homeopathy . They treat 200,000 NHS patients a year withhomeopathy . GPs are able to refer NHS patients to qualied and regulated homeopaths. However, it is notclear what the cost of homeopathy currently is to the NHS. 2.02 Although there is no scientic or denitive clinical trial evidence for the benet of homeopathy , there is anecdotal evidence of patients gaining benet from such treatment. For example an analysis of 23,000 out-patient consultations at the Bristol Homeopathic Hospital from 1997 to 2003, suggested that over 70% ofpatients followed up reported positive health changes following homeopathic treatment ( Spence et al Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine (2005) 11, 793-798). Furthermore there are instancesafter treatment using homeopathy that for some illnesses patients no longer required conventionaltreatment. For example the London homeopathic hospital report that \"specic projects on childhoodasthma and eczema showed a decrease in the use of steroid inhalers as well as the use of topical steroids in60% of the children\" ( ). 2.03 Homeopathy involves a holistic approach to the treatment of patients, which requires an assessment of the physical, mental and emotional state of the patient as well as the symptoms they present with. Whetherthe benets patients gain when taking homepathic preparations is due to a counselling e Vect ie someone just giving the time to listen to a patients problems and talk them through as many experts believe (a typicalinitial homeopathic consultations takes about 45-60 minutes, follow up ones slightly less), a psychologicaleVect due to the belief by the patient they will get better, or the actual homeopathic remedy itself, is not clear. 2.04 It must be also realised that homeopathic treatment on the NHS rarely means solely homeopathic remedies as it usually used in conjunction with conventional medicine and sometimes other complimentarymedicines. Indeed homeopaths frequently state that homeopathy should not be used instead of conventionalmedical treatment, but that it should be used in conjunction with it. Recommendation 5: research should urgently be undertaken to determine how e Vective homeopathic remedies are and whether it is the whole package of care provided by homeopathic treatment that isbenecial for the patient rather than the product per se Recommendation 6: homeopathic remedies should be reviewed by NICE if they are to be used within the NHS to ensure that they give value for money and to ensure that the funding of conventional medicines isnot compromised by their use Recommendation 7: the cost-benet ratio for homeopathic interventions should be established Recommendation 8: if homeopathy continues to be made available on the NHS all homeopaths must be registered with an appropriate body and governed by a Code of Ethics 3.The evidence on homeopathic products and services 3.01 Homeopathy has been used in Britain for about 150 years, and has always been available through the NHS since its inception in 1948 although it has gained increasing prominence with the general publicover the last 20 years, mainly because it is generally viewed as being safe (being prepared from plant, mineralor animal), not producing serious adverse reactions (other than aggravations, ie an initial worsening ofsymptoms following administration of the homeopathic remedy , or in individuals who have a lactosesensitivity when lactose is used as diluent), and not interacting with conventional medicines. (It is worthcommenting that homeopathic and herbal medicines are often confused in the Public's Committee: Evidence longevity of homeopathy no plausible scientic reason has yet been proposed as to why it should work. Further, as yet no unambiguous clinical trial data has been presented as evidence for the e Vectiveness of a homeopathic preparation. 3.02 Homeopathy is proposed to work on the principle of \"treating like with like\" and uses extremely dilute amounts of the homeopathic substance to treat an illness with symptoms that large doses of the samesubstance would actually cause in healthy patients. The philosophy of homeopathy that a substancebecomes more potent as it is diluted goes against the conventional theory of the pharmacological action ofcompounds in the body , which increase in activity with concentration. Homeopathic preparations are madeby repeated diluting and vigorous shaking (succusion) of a stock until there is little, if indeed any ,o ft h e original substance left. Successive succusion and dilution steps are required to potentise the preparation. 3.03 Such is the extent of dilution used in homeopathy that even the most concentrated homeopathic preparation generally used (ie a 6C preparation) contains only one picogram of homeopathic substance.(Conventional medicines are usually administered in milligram or microgram, ie 10 6or 10 3higher amounts.) The most commonly used preparation (a 30C preparation) is diluted to such an extent that only onemolecule of the homeopathic substance would be present in a sphere the size of the orbit of the planetNeptune. As a consequence of their extreme dilution, most high dilution/potency homeopathic remedies donot contain a single active molecule. The administration of a preparation containing substance at such largedilutions leads to a RPSGB view that such preparations will not produce clinical e Vects. 3.04 To explain the activity of the homeopathic preparation, homeopaths state that the homeopathic substance leaves a molecular \"imprint\" in the preparation that triggers your body's healing mechanisms,that the dilution and succusion steps are essential to the e Ycacy of the remedy , and that the more dilute the preparation, the more e Vective it becomes. However there is no robust scientic evidence to suggest that diVerences can be detected between ultra dilute homeopathic remedies and the diluent used to prepare the remedy in terms of their physical properties and behaviour. 3.05 In 1986, an RPSGB Council Statement on homeopathic products stated that with regard to homeopathic remedies, there was no scientic evidence for their e Ycacy , only anecdotal or subjective reports. A 2006 Law and Ethics bulletin reported that there was no scientic proof that homeopathicremedies were e Vective in preventing malaria. 3.06 In 1999, the RPSGB submitted a report on complementary and alternative medicine to the House of Lords Science and Technology Committee. In the report, a literature review of the e Ycacy of homeopathic medicines was presented which considered two recent meta-analyses. In summarising the available evidence,it was noted \"the equivocal outcome of these two meta-analyses, which represent the best cumulativeevidence on homeopathic remedies to date, together with the absence of a scientic basis for e Ycacy , implies that there is no scientic basis for the use of homeopathy to treat any specic clinical condition. However, anon-pharmacological therapeutic benet from the administration of a homeopathic remedy in an individualpatient can not be ruled out.\" 3.07 An Information Sheet produced on Homeopathy , which forms part of the \"Pharmacists\u2014the scientists in the high street\" series was commissioned by the RPSGB's Science Committee, the most recentupdate of which was produced in June 2007. In reviewing the research on homeopathic remedies, it stated\"there is no sound pharmacological or scientic basis for their activity . Conversely , there are many anecdotalaccounts of e Vectiveness.\" 3.08 A literature review of the evidence to date for homeopathy carried out in 2009 for RPSGB's Science Committee came to a very similar conclusion ( see Appendix 1 ). The main points that came out of this summary were (1) Relatively few randomised, controlled clinical trials (RCTs) have been carried out in the eld of homeopathy . (2) Of the many systematic reviews and meta-analyses of homeopathy RCTs, the majority showed that either there was no convincing evidence that homeopathy was superior to placebo, or that therewas not enough evidence to draw conclusions. (3) A recent Cochrane review reports preliminary data to support the use of specic homeopathic preparations to treat adverse e Vects of cancer treatments. Meta-analyses of homeopathy RCTs suggest that homeopathy may also be of some benet in postoperative ileus and acute pollinosis,and possibly in childhood diarrhoea. 1 (4) High quality RCTs tend to show that the e Vects of homeopathy are similar to placebo; lower quality trials tend to show an e Vect for homeopathy superior to placebo. (5) Arguments regarding the design and methodology used for RCTs are made by both proponents and opponents of homeopathy . (6) The placebo e Vect can be powerful and should not be underestimated, but is only e Vective for relatively minor ailments. 1Since this document was produced in May 2009, further examination of the references cited in the Cochrane review suggest that although the Calendula product showing benet in the treatment of the adverse e Vects of cancer was produced according to a homeopathic pharmacopoeia, its characteristics were more akin to Evidence Ev 5 (7) There is evidence that patients receiving individualised homeopathic treatment report clinical improvements. (8) More high quality research in homeopathy is required to increase the knowledge base. This includes RCT's covering the treatment of specic clinical conditions, as well as the e Vects of specic remedies. Furthermore, methodologies that encompass the holistic or individualised care approachof homeopathy need to be developed. 3.09 However as homeopathy is a whole person treatment it does not lend itself well to testing through the placebo-controlled randomised trial since signicant components of the treatment may be the interactionand trust building with patients that may be compromised if the patient has a chance of receiving a placebo.The classic homeopathic approach of one treatment per one person contrasts with the conventionalapproach of one or more therapies per disease, which may make many of the randomised controlled studydesigns inappropriate for homeopathic research. Despite this, most trials of homeopathic medicines do notindividualise treatments for patients. Interestingly results from meta analyses suggest that in cases ofindividualised treatment, homeopathy may have an e Vect over placebo. 3.10 While there is no sound pharmacological or scientic basis for the activity of homeopathic remedies, there are many anecdotal accounts of e Vectiveness. In this context the placebo e Vect can be powerful and should not be underestimated, but is only e Vective for relatively minor ailments. In conclusion there is no scientic or clinical evidence to support homeopathy , although in spite of this, patients still report benecial e Vects, especially from individualised patient treatments. November 2009 Memorandum submitted by the British Association of Homeopathic Manufacturers (HO30) 1. The British Association of Homeopathic Manufacturers (BAHM) welcomes the opportunity to submit evidence to the Science and Technology Select Committee's evidence check for homeopathy . As the tradeassociation for the manufacturing industry , we act as the focus point for discussions between the Medicinesand Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) and industry , ensuring that homeopathic productsare produced to the highest quality and safety standards. 2. We provide evidence below on the following issues: \u2014 Government policy on licensing of homeopathic products\u2014 Government policy on the funding of homeopathy through the NHS\u2014 The evidence base on homeopathic products and services About the British Association of Homeopathic Manufacturers 3. The British Association of Homeopathic Manufacturers was founded in 1992 to act as a central point for discussions between UK licensed homeopathic manufacturing industry and the (then) MedicinesControl Agency (MCA) in the run-up to the introduction of the EU Homeopathic Directive in 2001.BAHM's founder members were UK homeopathic manufacturing companies who held Product Licencesof Right for a wide range of medicinal products. Since the adoption of the EU Homeopathic Directive, twofurther UK manufacturers have obtained product registrations and have joined the BAHM. Today , BAHMcontinues to act as the focus point for discussions between the Medicines and Healthcare ProductsRegulatory Agency (MHRA) and the industry . 4. BAHM and its individual company members recognise the need for e Vective regulation of medicinal products in the UK and throughout the EU. As a responsible industry , BAHM members operate within thisregulatory framework to ensure that consumers, patients and practitioners have access to high qualityhomeopathic medicinal products as part of an integrated approach to healthcare in the UK. 5. BAHM member companies are: \u2014 Ainsworths Ltd., 36 New Cavendish Street, London W1G 8UF\u2014 A. Nelson and Co. Ltd., Parkside, Wimbledon, SW19 5LP\u2014 Helios Ltd., DE7 6. Together, these companies represent 95% of UK homeopathic production. Government Policy on Licensing of Homeopathic Products 7. Homeopathic medicinal products in the UK are authorised or registered in accordance with the legislation for medicinal products. They may have: \u2014 Product Licences of \u2014 Homeopathic Registration Certicates, granted by MHRA in accordance with the requirements of Directive 92/73/EC, or \u2014 Homeopathic Registration Certicates, granted by MHRA under the National Rules scheme, in accordance with the requirements of Directive 200l/83/EC. 8. The primary purpose of the MHRA licensing process is to guarantee patient and consumer safety . As the Department of Health noted in its submission to the committee's broader evidence check in the summer, \"only products which are indicated for the relief of minor symptoms and minor conditions in humans are eligible for a homeopathic marketing authorisation under this scheme. For these purposes, minorsymptoms are those which can ordinarily and with reasonable safety be relieved or treated withoutthe supervision or intervention of a doctor. \" 9. Patients themselves can make decisions on Over the Counter product purchase in the full knowledge that the homeopathic medicines they are purchasing are safe. Health professionals, particularly GPs andpharmacists, are also in a strong position to advise on when complementary products and services canprovide a solution, and when conventional medicines are more appropriate and can prescribe homeopathicmedicines accordingly . Government Policy on the Funding of Homeopathy through the NHS 10. The Department of Health determines and authorises those homeopathic medicines that can be obtained via NHS prescription. It is up to Primary Care Trusts to determine the flow of funds in eachparticular area are available within the National Health Service, and to direct funds accordingly . 11. As Department of Health Minister Phil Hope MP said in a written answer on 5 February 2009: \"The Government considers that it is the responsibility of the National Health Service to make decisions on what treatments are most appropriate for their patients, including complementaryand alternative medicine treatments and referrals to homeopathic hospitals. In some casescomplementary and alternative medicine treatments may be appropriate and a general practitionerwould make a decision to refer taking into account safety , clinical and cost e Vectiveness as well as the availability of suitably qualied and regulated practitioners.\" ( OYcial Report , 5 February 2009, column WA 1501) 12. The situation in other European countries is radically di Verent to the UK. For example, in France, 25% of prescriptions are homeopathic. The situation in Germany is similar. Whilst we are aware that thereimbursement system is di Verent in France and Germany , it is nevertheless signicant that medical practitioners see a role for homeopathic medicines and are willing to direct prescribing decisions accordingly . TheEvidence Base on Homeopathic Products and Services 13. The authorisation/registration legislation for homeopathic medicinal products primarily relates to assurance of safety and quality as we describe above. Comment on homeopathic \"services\" is outside thescope of activity of the BAHM. 14. There is a place for homeopathic medicine in any system based on patient outcomes and patient demand, and the Faculty of Homeopathy has separately studied the evidence base in detail. 15. As indicated above, patients themselves make decisions on product purchase in the full knowledge that the homeopathic medicines they are purchasing are safe, often under the guidance of GPs andpharmacists. Such professionals are in a strong place to advise when homeopathic medicines present a cost-eVective, quality solution to specic health conditions. November 2009 Memorandum submitted by Sense About Science (HO36) 1. B ackground Sense About Science is a UK registered charity that works to equip people to make sense of science and evidence. We work with over 4,000 scientists, from Nobel prize winners to our V oice of Young Sciencenetwork of postdoctoral researchers, to help civic groups including community organisations, media andcommentators to weigh up claims about evidence. 2.1 Public perception of homeopathy We monitor public discussions, together with our own log of requests for help and concerns raised by scientists, to identify frequently occurring misconceptions or misleading information. In 2006 we revieweddiscussion about homeopathy and made two observations: (a) That it was believed to contain an active ingredient, and was often confused with herbal medicine (and, related to this, that people were often unaware of the mystical belief in water memory andin \"like cures like\" on Evidence Ev 7 (b) That because it was supplied on the National Health Service, it was assumed that it \"must be eVective\" and \"there must be something in it\". 2.2 We also noted regular reports of homeopathic remedies being marketed for serious diseases, notably at that time anti-malarial prophylaxis. We assessed this to be in part a consequence of the assumptions (a)and (b) above. 2.3 We noted, through discussions held with clinicians and researchers, that there was an atmosphere of resigned frustration about the possibility of addressing the misconception that homeopathic productscontain active ingredients and the misconception that there was reliable evidence of e Ycacy beyond the placebo e Vect. In particular they found it hard to argue against something that was supplied through the NHS and that appeared to be o Ycially endorsed. We also noted their frustration about the acclaimed \"holistic\" approach of homeopathy despite its inability to diagnose disease and the potentially dangerousconsequences of that. Furthermore, if the use of some unproven and unlikely remedies is o Ycially flattered and endorsed, then this a Vects our ability to reason through debates about the suitability or provision of any other remedy . In other words, one cannot demand that people accept the evidence regarding the provision ofdrugs for Alzheimer's yet overlook it regarding the provision of homeopathy . 2.4 Scientists' resignation to public misconceptions is anathema to Sense About Science's mission of equipping the public to make sense of science and evidence. It disenfranchises the public by removingscientic reasoning to senior common rooms and private clubs. 3. C hallenging Perceptions We supported and encouraged medical scientists to make themselves plain in public discussions about homeopathy in the following ways: 3.1 In May 2006, a group of medical specialists, led by cancer surgeon Professor Mike Baum, writing to the medical directors and directors of public health at NHS trusts to draw attention to the provision ofhomeopathy and the lack of evidence in support of its e Ycacy . In particular they raised concern about: overt promotion of homeopathy for general use in the NHS, including on the NHS Direct website; a government-funded patient guide, prepared by the Foundation for Integrated Health; and the Smallwood reportcommissioned by the Prince of Wales to make a case for increasing NHS provision of homeopathy . Theypointed out that over a dozen systemic reviews had failed to provide convincing evidence of e Vectiveness. This letter was followed one year later with a letter led by Professor Gus Born, enclosing a copy of anevidence review by a London NHS trust. 3.2 From this time, a group of clinical researchers and journalists gathering information on the extent of provision of homeopathy by NHS trusts, a summary of which has been supplied to you separately . 3.3 In July 2006, working with experts in malaria and tropical diseases to warn the public that homeopathic medicines o Ver no protection against malaria or other serious tropical diseases. This followed a short investigation by Sense About Science, which showed that the rst ten homeopathic clinics andpharmacies selected from an internet search and consulted were willing to break public health protocols byproviding unproven homeopathic pills to protect against malaria and other tropical diseases such as typhoid,dengue fever and yellow fever. In widely report comments, the malaria experts called on the Governmentto ensure that the safety of the travelling public was not put at risk by such prescriptions. Subsequent actionwas brought by the Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain (the pharmacy registration body at thattime) against two of the pharmacies investigated. This is ongoing. 3.4 In September 2006 producing a short public leaflet, Sense About Homeopathy , describing homeopathy in a scientic context and exploring why some people think it works (http://www.senseaboutscience.org.uk/pdf/SenseAboutHomeopathy .pdf). 3.5 In autumn 2006, challenging the Medicines for Human Use (National Rules for Homeopathic Products) Regulations 2006. The new regulations permitted homeopathic products to make medical claimsbut exempted them from providing scientic evidence that they are e Vective. This was the rst time in its history that the regulation of medicines moved away from science and from clear, meaningful informationfor the public. What is more, it happened without parliamentary time or public debate. In October 2009,Sense About Science summarised for parliament hundreds of responses protesting the introduction of theregulations, including many from scientic and medical bodies. These were instrumental in pressing for thedebate that was held in the House of Lords on 26 October 2006. The serious concerns of the scientic andmedical community were raised by Lord Taverne (Chairman of Sense About Science), Lord Rees of Ludlow(President of the Royal Society), Lord Turnberg, Lord Jenkin of Roding, Lord McColl of Dulwich andBaroness O'Neill of Bengarve. A summary of our objection at that time was: \"The regulations The mission of the UK's licensing body , the Medicine and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), is to ensure \"that medicines and medical devices work, and are acceptably safe\".However, with the introduction of the new rules for homeopathy , it now accepts homeopathicprovings as evidence of e Ycacy . A \"proving\" is the method homeopaths use to determine the symptoms a substance causes (with a view to treating diseases with similar symptoms). Provingsare not carried out on the nished product and are nothing to do with Technology Committee: Evidence The regulations also mean that, for the rst time in more than 30 years, homeopathic products will be able to make medical claims such as \"For the relief of...\". Such claims, however worded, implyeYcacy where none has been proven. The MHRA did not have to change the regulations in this way . It was not required to do so by EC Directive 2001/83. The MHRA set out four options to government, including doing nothing. Itchose to eliminate the old, stricter licences in order to facilitate the \"expansion of the homeopathicindustry\" through new products. The MHRA has designed the regulations to respond to pressure from the homeopathic industry , which wants to expand (see impact assessment right).\" 3.6 In June 2009 working with V oice of Young Science to urge the World Health Organisation to respond to the promotion of homeopathy in developing countries for infant diarrhoea, influenza, HIV , tuberculosisand TB. A note from Julia Wilson of V oYS is appended. 1.Summary A group of young researchers have received comments from directors of WHO disease programmes stating that they do not recommend homeopathy for the treatment of HIV , influenza, TB, Malaria andInfant diarrhoea. These comments have been sent to all health minsters in the world and provide a guidelinefor governments and health care workers dealing with these issues. 2.Background V oice of Young Science (V oYS) is a network of over 600 early career researchers set up by Sense About Science. Sense About Science is a charity that equips people to make sense of science and evidence. V oYSbecame aware of a conference 2promoting the use of homeopathy in developing countries and discovered that homeopaths are setting up clinics in these countries and claiming to treat HIV , malaria, TB, influenzaand infant diarrhoea. Medics working with the most rural and impoverished people of the world alreadystruggle to deliver the medical help that is needed. The promotion of homeopathy for serious diseases putslives at risk. On 1 June 2009 25 early career researchers and medics from the UK and Africa sent an openletter to the World Health Organisation (WHO) calling on the body to condemn the promotion ofhomeopathy for treating life threatening diseases. Their letter available at http://www.senseaboutscience.org.uk/index.php/site/project/331/had the support of leading international expertsin malaria, HIV and other serious diseases. 3.Response V oYS received supportive comments from the Stop TB Department, the TB Strategy and Health Systems, the HIV/AIDS Department, the Global Malaria Programme and the Department of Child and AdolescentHealth and Development stating that they do not recommend homeopathy for serious diseases. Thesecomments are available at http://www.senseaboutscience.org.uk/index.php/site/project/392/. The DirectorGeneral's o Yce conrmed that these \"clearly express the WHO position\". 4.Impact V oYS released the WHO response on 21 August 2009. It was sent to the health ministers of all countries to highlight the WHO's position on homeopathy and to call on governments to combat its promotion forserious diseases. The WHO response was covered widely in UK and international media including African,Indian and South American news. V oYS were contacted by a number of researchers and medics in Africaand India, organisations such as the Centre for Inquiry in Nigeria and several South African journalists,concerned about the promotion of homeopathy in their countries and pleased to have this support. November 2009 Memorandum submitted by Dr Ben Goldacre (HO 40) Background Sugar pills which have been prepared in accordance with the principles or rituals of homeopaths are physically indistinguishable from untreated or \"placebo\" sugar pills, and these homeopathy pills haveoverall been shown, repeatedly , in summaries of fair clinical trials, to perform no better than dummy placebosugar pills. Any claims to the contrary rely on cherry picking the evidence to selectively reference onlypositive ndings, to reference poorer quality studies which are not \"fair tests\" of the pills, and so on. Almostany ine Vective medical treatment could be made to appear e Vective using these strategies: they simply reflect misleading and partisan scholarship. These sugar pills are not physically harmful, nor do they physically 2Homeopathy for Developing Countries, An International Conference in Amersfoort, the Netherlands, 6-7 June 2009. The programme can 9 confer benet on patients. Where there are benets (and indeed harms) from these sugar pills, it is only in how they are presented. I assume that this basic territory will be covered by others, and conne mysubmission to issues that interest me particularly . Licensing of Homeopathic Pills The Medicines and Healthcare Regulatory Agency (MHRA) approved label on homeopathy sugar pills is misleading . A great deal of e Vort has gone into making patient literature, leaflets, and labels more easily understood, explaining the benets and risks of treatments clearly , so it seems perverse and anomalous thatthe MHRA have settled on a plainly misleading convention for labelling these homeopathic sugar pills. TheMHRA may deploy sophistry , or invoke technical readings of the statements, but the public read these labelsas saying that the homeopathic sugar pills are e Vective for the conditions listed. They are not e Vective, and the MHRA know they are not. The confused wording of the labels is compounded by the fact that thegovernment medicines regulator is giving licenses to pills sold in pharmacies which have not been shown tobe eVective, something few would expect a government regulator to do, so this unusual state of a Vairs requires even more explicit clarity than normal. As things stand, this labelling system is misleading, ignoresthe evidence on best practise in communicating risks and benets to the public, and should be changed. The MHRA approval reinforces an unwelcome situation in which pharmacists are misleading patients . Patients and doctors should be entitled to trust pharmacists as a valuable source of evidence-basedinformation on the treatments they deal in. Pharmacists hold themselves out as a valuable communityresource in this regard, for example in the Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain's (RPSGB)\"Scientist In The High Street\" campaign. Now they are selling placebo sugar pills to sick people bymisleading them. Each profession should be free to make its own decisions, but it may be worth ensuring thatthe public are told that pharmacists have abandoned their previous principles, so that they are not trusted inerror. Homeopathy on the NHS The obvious argument is that homeopathy , since it works no better than placebo, should not be funded by the NHS. Although homeopathy is certainly not the biggest example of resources being wasted on anineVective treatment, a recession should be a time for rational disinvestment, homeopathy is a clear example, and the NHS should be scanning its activities for other good candidates. Although it is clear that homeopathy works no better than placebo, I do however accept that circumstances might occur in which it could arguably be desirable to have the option of prescribing aplacebo. There are often situations where an individual may want treatment, for example, but wheremedicine has little to o Ver\u2014lots of back pain, stress at work, medically unexplained fatigue, and most common colds, to give just a few examples. Going through a \"theatre\" of medical treatment, and trying everymedication in the book, will only risk side-e Vects. A harmless sugar pill in these circumstances may seem to be the sensible option. However the limited benets must be weighed up against the risks: 1. Prescribing a placebo requires that a healthcare practitioner misleads their patient, which is unethical, paternalistic, and undermines the current emphasis on shared decision making inmedicine. It also undermines the credibility of healthcare professionals' utterances, when it iswidely known that doctors and others will lie to you about a treatment. 2. Even if we accepted that it was desirable and cost e Vective to prescribe a placebo, and responsible healthcare practitioners could be found who were willing to work around the ethical issues and doso, homeopathy may not be the best model for delivering placeboes, for a number of reasons: (a) It is routine marketing practice for homeopaths to denigrate mainstream medicine, for example campaigning against vaccination programmes, advising against medical treatments,undermining treatments such as chemotherapy which are distressing\u2014but overall conferbenet\u2014by overstating the side e Vects, and so on. One study found that more than half of all homeopaths approached advised a client against the MMR vaccine for their child. A BBCNewsnight investigation found that almost all the homeopaths approached recommendedineVective homeopathic pills to protect against malaria, and advised against medical malaria prophylactics, while not even giving basic advice on bite prevention. (b) Homeopaths who are not medically qualied can miss fatal diagnoses, actively disregard them, advise patients to avoid benecial medications, and so on. (c) Senior and respected homeopaths, and homeopathic membership groups, promote irresponsible and extreme quackery . One example of many is the Society of Homeopaths'symposium on the treatment of Aids, featuring the work of Peter Chappell (a man who claimsto have found a homeopathic solution to the Aids epidemic involving homeopathic remedieswhich are broadcast over the radio). The state should not be encouraging the public to trustpeople and organisations which go anywhere near such Technology Committee: Evidence (d) The endorsement of these sugar pills by the NHS is used by homeopaths as evidence that they work, and this further misleads the public. There are also more specic examples. Visitors toeveryday NHS medicine clinics which happen to be held in the building of the Royal LondonHomeopathic Hospital in Queen's Square, walk past adverts proclaiming that homeopathysugar pills are e Vective for a range of childhood and adult conditions, in an NHS setting. This is misleading and an abuse of the good faith that people have in the NHS. (e) Homeopaths\u2014and the marketing activity around homeopathy\u2014mislead the public by sending out false messages on evidence in the name of marketing their pills, for examplemaking prominent arguments in popular media claiming incorrectly that fair trials ofhomeopathy sugar pills cannot be done, or that systematic reviews of the literature are biased.This is corrosive. Ideally we would be encouraging patients to have a greater understandingof evidence based medicine, of how we know what is good for us and bad for us, to improveengagement in shared decision making with doctors, and to encourage participation inclinical trials. (f) Homeopaths have cut themselves o Vfrom normal academic discourse on evidence based medicine by threatening critics with legal action to silence them, failing to engage withcriticisms adequately in their literature, and shrouding their university teaching in secrecy . Ican nd no evidence that any of the plain criticisms I have outlined above with regard to thepractise of homeopathy are seriously discussed by homeopaths. This would be unusual inother healthcare professions. Conclusions 1. It is my view that the MHRA labelling system is misleading, not evidence based, and should be overhauled so that it unambiguously and explicitly states that homeopathy sugar pills have not been shownto be e Vective. 2. If the government believes that prescribing placebo sugar pills is a cost-e Vective strategy to manage a sub-population of treatment-resistant patients, then they should specify the characteristics of thispopulation and commission a pragmatic cost-e Vectiveness analysis, comparing \"GP treatment-as-usual\" against \"GP treatment-as-usual plus homeopathy\". There is no need for any further trials comparinghomeopathy sugar pills against untreated \"placebo\" sugar pills, as we already know the answer to thatquestion, and we know that homeopaths ignore the results, so any further trials of that design are wastefuland uninformative. Dr Ben GoldacreNovember 2009 Witnesses: Mr Paul Bennett , Professional Standards Director and Superintendent Pharmacist, Boots, Ms Tracey Brown , Managing Director, Sense About Science, Mr Ben Goldacre , Journalist, Professor Jayne Lawrence , Chief Scientic Adviser, Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain, and Mr Robert Wilson , Chairman, British Association of Homeopathic Manufacturers (BAHM), gave evidence. Q1 Chairman: Good morning everyone. This is a one-o Vevidence check session on homeopathy . It is part of a series of evidence checks we are doing as theScience and Technology Committee looking acrossgovernment at whether there is evidence to supportGovernment policy or, indeed, what evidence thereis to actually scrutinise the e Vectiveness of Government policy . In a public call for topicshomeopathy was one of the issues that was raised,and we are very happy to have this session. Wewelcome for our rst panel Paul Bennett,Professional Standards Director and SuperintendentPharmacist Boots\u2014welcome to you, Paul, and thank you very much for coming; Tracey Brown, theManaging Director for Sense About Science\u2014welcome to you, Tracey; Dr Ben Goldacre, ajournalist from The Guardian \u2014welcome to you, Ben, this morning; Professor Jayne Lawrence, theChief Scientic Adviser for the RoyalPharmaceutical Society of Great Britain\u2014welcometo you; and, last but by no means least, RobertWilson, the Chairman of the British Association ofHomeopathic Manufacturers (BAHM)\u2014welcomeand thank you very much indeed for coming. I wonder if I could start with you, Paul, this morning.You actually manufacture and sell homeopathicremedies. Do they work beyond the placebo e Vect, very briefly?Mr Bennett: First, I need to correct you actually , I am afraid. We do not manufacture products. Q2 Chairman: You sell them though? Mr Bennett: We do sell them. Q3 Chairman: So you sell them? Mr Bennett: We do indeed sell them and there is certainly a consumer demand for those products. Q4 Chairman: I did not ask you that question. I said do they work beyond the placebo e Vect? Mr Bennett: I have no evidence before me to suggest that they are e Ycacious, and we look very much for the evidence to support that, and so I am unable togive you a yes or no answer to Evidence Ev 11 25 November 2009 Mr Paul Bennett, Ms Tracey Brown, Mr Ben Goldacre, Professor Jayne Lawrence and Mr Robert Wilson Q5 Chairman: You sell them but you do not believe they are e Ycacious? Mr Bennett: It is about consumer choice for us. A large number of our consumers actually do believethey are e Ycacious, but they are licensed medicinal products and, therefore, we believe it is right to makethem available. Q6 Chairman: But as a company you do not believe that they necessarily are?Mr Bennett: We do not disbelieve either. It is an evidence issue. Q7 Chairman: Robert, what is your position? You do manufacture.Mr Wilson: We do manufacture, yes, and I represent 95 per cent of the manufacturers in the UK.Denitely we believe there is a strong case for theeYcaciousness of homeopathic medicines. This is an industry that has been growing strongly . It has beenaround for 200 years and I think it is worth sayingthat in France it is a 400 million euro business and inGermany it is the same. Q8 Chairman: So is prostitution. It does not mean to say it is right, does it? My question to you, Robert,is does it work outside the placebo e Vect? Mr Wilson: It denitely does work outside the placebo e Vect. Q9 Chairman: It denitely does. You have cast-iron evidence to support that?Mr Wilson: We have many trials that show a strong eYcaciousness for homeopathic medicines. Q10 Chairman: Why do you not supply that to Boots then?Mr Wilson: We do supply that to Boots. Q11 Chairman: So why do they not believe you? Mr Wilson: They do believe us. Q12 Chairman: He has just said they do not. Mr Wilson: No. Q13 Chairman: He said he neither believes you or he does not believe you.Mr Wilson: He has not asked us specically about the e Ycaciousness of homeopathic medicines. Boots are a very important retailer; they sell a great deal ofthese products. You have also got to ask thequestion, if these products did not work beyond theplacebo e Vect, why do people keep buying them? Leaving that aside, there is a trial out which wasliterally published in the last\u2014 Q14 Chairman: That was not a serious point, was it? Was that a serious point you were making?Mr Wilson: Yes, I believe, certainly , that people continue to buy products because they work forthem.Q15 Chairman: Because they work for them? Mr Wilson: Yes. Q16 Chairman: Even though there is no evidence. Mr Wilson: There is a lot of evidence. Q17 Chairman: Will you give me just one product where you say there is clear evidence that one of thethings that you manufacture as a homeopathicremedy actually works?Mr Wilson: Arnica, which is for bruising, and is extremely useful in post-operative care. There was amajor trial done on arnica and, indeed, there is onethat has just been published, the Witt Trial, whichwas done by the Charite \u00b4Hospital in Berlin. It was a large trial\u20143,700 patients involved\u2014and that hasshown clearly that there is a strong benet inhomeopathic use to these patients with long-termchronic conditions. One of the subjects of that trialwas arnica. Q18 Chairman: Professor Lawrence, from the Royal Pharmaceutical Society , do you believe thathomeopathic remedies work beyond the placeboeVect? Professor Lawrence: No, we do not believe there is any scientic or clinical evidence, using standardclinical trials, that there is\u2014 Q19 Chairman: Even for arnica? Professor Lawrence: I have not seen this latest trial, but certainly up until recently we reviewed all theevidence and we believe there is not any clinical orscientic evidence supporting their use. Q20 Ian Stewart: Does that mean they do not work at all? Are you very denite that they do not workat all?Professor Lawrence: Some patients, a lot of patients in fact, claim to have beneted, if they are askedafterwards, from the therapies. Q21 Ian Stewart: That is a di Verent issue. Professor Lawrence: There is no evidence that we can see that supports\u2014 Q22 Ian Stewart: It is only that there is no evidence. You are not saying that that does not mean that theywork in some cases?Professor Lawrence: There is no scientic basis for their being e Vective. There is no reason why they would be e Vective scientically . Q23 Chairman: Dr Goldacre, what is your view? Is there any e Vect beyond the placebo e Vect? Dr Goldacre: No. The placebo e Vect is undoubtedly very powerful, and that is one reason why they arevery attractive to people, but if you look at all of thetrials in the whole, collectively , what you see whenyou look at the best quality trials is that homeopathypills work no better than placebo pills. You canselect individual trials and say: we have got thisindividual trial, or even ten individual trials, whichshow that it works, but if Technology Committee: Evidence 25 November 2009 Mr Paul Bennett, Ms Tracey Brown, Mr Ben Goldacre, Professor Jayne Lawrence and Mr Robert Wilson literature and pick out only the positive results and ignore the unfavourable results, you can make anytreatment work, including ones that are known to beineVective or even dangerous. That is just bad scholarship. Q24 Chairman: Do you believe that they are harmful though?Dr Goldacre: I do not think they are physically harmful, in the same way that they are not physicallybenecial. I think that they can have other harms.For example, I think pharmacists sellinghomeopathic sugar pills on the high street to patientsand to the public is very harmful to the publicreputation of pharmacists. The RPSGB describespharmacists on the high street as being the \"scientistin the high street\", and I think it is sad that the publicare now having to realise that, in fact, what shouldbe a trustworthy resource for information onhealthcare is, in fact, somebody who is, as a businessperson, selling them sugar pills. Q25 Ian Stewart: Can we be clear as to what you have said there. It is harmful to pharmacists; you arenot saying it is harmful to patients.Dr Goldacre: That was one example of non-physical harm. I think they are culturally harmful. I think itis harmful, for example, to tell people that a sugarpill is an e Vective treatment when it is not; I think you undermine the credibility of the doctor, thehealthcare worker, the pharmacist; I think youundermine the credibility of the MHRA. When youdrive people into the hands of alternative therapistswho may not be adequately medically trained bygiving them credibility through MHRA approval, asit is perceived, then you drive people into the handsof people who may not be able to spot seriousdiagnoses. I think there are a number of harms thatcome, but none of them, you are absolutely correctto say , are direct physical harms. I do not believe thatsugar pills are physically harmful; nor are theybenecial to people physically . Q26 Chairman: I want to try and move on. Beyond the placebo e Vect, no justication? Ms Brown: No, I am of a similar mind to Ben and Jayne Lawrence. Q27 Chairman: But they are not harmful? Ms Brown: Actually , I think there is the issue that even minor conditions can sometimes betray a moreserious condition. For example, constipation. Itsounds harmless to be taking sugar pills forconstipation, but actually sometimes that is asymptom of a more serious condition and diagnosisis necessary . So there is the possibility of delayeddiagnosis or people believing that they are seekingeVective treatment when they are not. There is also a broader harm to the public, I think. If you thinkabout the rows that have happened around thingslike the prescription of Alzheimer's drugs on theNHS, on the one hand, you are expecting people tolook at the evidence to understand why certain drugsare available for people with a condition and certain are not and, on the other, you throw the evidence upin the air and say that if people want it they shouldhave it. We just lose, as a society , the dividing line,the ability to talk to people about the evidencebehind their medicines, and I think that is a seriouspublic health issue. Q28 Chairman: So we should sell nothing unless it has got clear evidence to support the claims of whatit does?Ms Brown: I think the point at issue is that we should flatter nothing with o Ycial endorsement. If people want to make potions and lotions and sell them toone another, I do not have a very strong view aboutthat, but when that has o Ycial endorsement, for example a medicines licence, then I think we have aproblem, because that does give people the messagethat some judgment has been made about its use andthe treatment of that condition. Q29 Chairman: So you think that homeopathic products should be licensed before they can be sold?Ms Brown: There was always previously what is called the Simplied Scheme, which is aboutmanufacturing safety , quality and cleanliness, and Ithink there is no problem with reviewing that kind ofquality over medicine, but any suggestion that theyshould have indications that they are e Vective in the treatment of certain conditions, I think that becomesa problem, and that is the situation we are in at themoment. Q30 Dr Harris: Can I rst declare an interest that I have worked with Sense About Science on a numberof issues and I have personally argued a lot with BenGoldacre over the years. I want to ask Mr Wilson,while we are on declarations of interests, you andyour members make money out of selling this and,obviously , if they can have medical indications onthem they might sell better and then you might makemore money . Is that accurate?Mr Wilson: I represent the manufacturers. There is one thing I would like to say on the scienticevidence, if I may . I think it is important to say thata number of the trials that are put forward aboutdiscrediting homeopathy are with very , very smallsample groups. Q31 Dr Harris: I was going to come on to that. I just wanted to give you the chance to put your interest onthe record.Mr Wilson: Yes, I represent the manufacturers. Q32 Dr Harris: Let me ask you a question then, and I will ask you about evidence. You heard DrGoldacre say that the best way of looking at theevidence is to look at all the evidence, positive andnegative, look at, for example, systematic reviews ormeta-analyses as the best way of looking atpublished data, so that you are looking at the besttrials, selecting the best trials and discarding thosethat are flawed and then using that. Do Evidence Ev 13 25 November 2009 Mr Paul Bennett, Ms Tracey Brown, Mr Ben Goldacre, Professor Jayne Lawrence and Mr Robert Wilson that as the best way of doing it, or do you think that picking a trial that other people may not have seenthat has just been published is a better way? Mr Wilson: No; absolutely . I think the important thing is the homeopathic industry is extremely proresearch and pro trials. What we say is there have tobe good trials. In The Lancet article there was the Langer experiment where they compared 100 trials.In each of those trials the median number of peopleinvolved was 65. Now 65 people in any trial is notstatistically relevant. If you look at a number of theexperts in trials, they will always say size is the onlything that matters. When you talk about a trial, thesecond question you should ask is how big was thesample? Any sample of fewer than 500 is not goingto be statistically relevant. Q33 Dr Harris: Hang on a second, because this was not my question. Firstly , I think we can all agree, butI will stand to be corrected, that whether the samplesize is statistically signicant depends on thefrequency of the outcome you are measuring. So forrare outcomes you would clearly need to power upthe sample, but that was not my question. Myquestion to you, which I would urge you to answer,is do you accept the assertion that has been madethat the best way to consider the evidence is to lookat systematic reviews, including meta-analyseswhich combine sample sizes from a number ofstudies in a scientically valid way , and judge theoutcome, the conclusions of those systematic reviews which discard the flawed trials? It does notmatter how many patients you have in a flawed trialif it its flawed. Do you accept that that is better than,to quote Dr Goldacre, cherry-picking from eitherside of the argument individual trials? That is astraightforward question. Mr Wilson: The danger of meta-analysis is that all it does is compare a number of trials. If those trials arenot good, it is still comparing bad trials. So if youhave got a series of small groups of, say , 20 patientsin a trial, and then you compare that with a series ofothers, you are still getting a skewed result. Q34 Dr Harris: You are repeating yourself. I am asking a di Verent question. Systematic reviews discard flawed trials, they do not count them at all,and they aggregate the results of a number of trials\u2014large ones, small ones\u2014which are well-designed.That is what they do. Do you accept\u2014and I will askyou this for the third time\u2014that that is a better wayof judging the whole of the evidence than cherry-picking, on either side of the argument, individualtrials? Mr Wilson: I think the key question is\u2014 Q35 Dr Harris: Yes or no. You are not asking me a question. Mr Wilson: You have used the phrase \"well- designed\" a number of times. It does not matter howwell designed a trial is if it is only 20 patients.Q36 Dr Harris: I am talking about systematic reviews. Are you saying some systematic reviews aregood and some are bad? I am not making progressthere, so I will change my question. When you wereasked about the evidence, you did not suggest, as faras I can recall, homeopathic provings as being goodevidence. Do you think, compared to cherry-pickedtrials or systematic reviews, homeopathic provingsrepresent good evidence of e Vectiveness? Mr Wilson: No, a homeopathic proving is a technical term for when homeopathic medicines areassessed. It is not a way of doing a trial, proving. Q37 Dr Harris: But it is the provings that are relied on by the MHRA. That is a condition, under the newscheme, the new National Rules, for the MHRAallowing indications to be given, claims to be givenfor the alleviation of minor illnesses. That is right, isit not? Mr Wilson: The proving is part of the bibliographical traditional evidence for ahomeopathic remedy . Q38 Dr Harris: I would just like to ask Paul Bennett if he has any qualms at all about making money , asyou do\u2014it is your right to do that\u2014out of sellingproducts which you do not believe are e Vective but which have, on the basis of homeopathic provings(which even the homeopaths do not think is the bestevidence of e Vectiveness) a stamp from the MHRA saying you are allowed to say this is e Vective, or can be e Vective, in constipation. Do you have any qualms about that? Mr Bennett: I think actually at the root of this is that these are regulated products which are safe, and it is actually really important that we are able to supportthe very large number of our consumers who believethey are e Ycacious through their own experience and through recommendations from others. I thinkto deny somebody access to a product of that naturewhere they strongly believe it is e Ycacious would be wrong for us to do. Q39 Dr Harris: If someone believed that paracetamol was e Ycacious in preventing heart disease and the paracetamol said on it \"this can beused to prevent heart disease\" you would not behappy and I am sure Jayne Lawrence would not behappy with that. So what is it about homeopathywhich does not give you qualms when they makeclaims which you say you do not believe stand up?No-one is saying you should not sell them and youshould not sell them as certied as safe and well-manufactured and the box says what is in it, which isnothing\u2014that is ne\u2014but do you not have qualmsabout selling things that have assertions on aboutclinical e Vectiveness that do not have evidence behind them and evidence that you do not believe? Mr Bennett: Again, our key requirement here is for greater clinical evidence. If that were available to usas retailers and to the consumer, I think that Technology Committee: Evidence 25 November 2009 Mr Paul Bennett, Ms Tracey Brown, Mr Ben Goldacre, Professor Jayne Lawrence and Mr Robert Wilson Dr Harris: How would it be helpful? There has been a series of systematic reviews which demonstrate inhomeopathy\u2014I am not talking about the herbalstuVthat is around\u2014that there is no e Vectiveness beyond placebo. Yet you are not selling them asplacebos, you are selling some of these products withindications. Do you not feel that if you were amanufacturer of something that had gone throughclinical trials to treat these minor ailments\u2014Chairman: I think he has got the point. Dr Harris: There has been all this evidence. Q40 Chairman: He has got the point. I am sure he will give us an answer.Mr Bennett: The point is that the products that we retail clearly have a label on them which states \"ahomeopathic medicinal product without approvedtherapeutic indications\", because we cannot drawupon any further information to give thattherapeutic assurance. Q41 Dr Harris: Some of them now will have under the National Rules this claim?Mr Bennett: They will under the National Rules. Q42 Dr Harris: Indeed, some of them have from the old PLR.Mr Bennett: But the products that we have available which are manufactured by Nelsons on behalf ofBoots would be of that type, the type that does nothave a therapeutic indication.Chairman: I am going to call a halt there and bring in Brian Iddon. Q43 Dr Iddon: I have a problem with the interpretation of EC Directive 2001/83 through theNational Rules Scheme. I turn to you rst, Paul.When you are selling vitamins and minerals on yourshelves you are not allowed (and neither are othermanufacturers or wholesalers or retailers) toadvertise any medicinal value for those productsunless there is clear scientic and clinical evidencefor the medicinal claims, but the way that theMHRA in this country have interpreted that ECDirective through the National Rules Scheme allowsyou to sell homeopathic products with medicinalclaims without the evidence. Surely that is a seriouscontradiction in this country?Mr Bennett: I am happy to respond. I am concerned I am going to sound a little bit like a broken recordin my response. I actually think that question wouldbe a good one for the MHRA, who, I believe, areattending this Committee at another session. Q44 Dr Iddon: We will put it to them. Mr Bennett: I am sure you will. From a community pharmacy retail point of view, we rely very heavilyon the regulatory process to indicate to us whichproducts are approved and safe for sale. If theregulatory process is inadequate, then I wouldsuggest that is something that does need to be takenup with the MHRA. We would respond accordinglyto that, but at the moment we are operating withinthe regulatory framework that exists.Q45 Dr Iddon: I turn to Robert Wilson at the other end of the table and put a similar question to you,Robert. Has not the National Rules Scheme beenwritten deliberately to allow the interpretation ofthis EC Directive so that the homeopathic industrycan expand?Mr Wilson: The National Rules Scheme is the implementation of an EU Directive; so it comesfrom Europe. The homeopathic market in Europe is\u00a31.5 billion. One in four prescriptions in France ishomeopathic, so this is a sizeable Europeanbusiness. In this country the market is very small bycomparison\u2014about \u00a330 million. So these are rulesthat have come from Brussels that is used tohomeopathy as part of their mainstream healthcareoVering. All the MHRA has done is implement a series of Directives that have been pushed fromEurope and the National Rules Scheme isembodying clause 16.2 of that Directive whichallows indications for minor complaints. By minorcomplaints we mean things that are not going torequire the intervention of a doctor or medicalpractitioner. All that the UK MHRA is doing isimplementing an EU Directive. There are a numberof examples of EU Directives in herbal medicine, intraditional use medicine, where a system of medicinehas been around for hundreds of years that they willallow bibliographical evidence to uphold a medicalclaim in a self-limiting or minor symptomatic area. Q46 Dr Iddon: I will put to the rest of the panel now another question. Why should the MHRA have aninterest in supporting the homeopathic industrywhen so many people believe there is no clinicalevidence for the e Ycacy of the products? Ms Brown: That sits really uneasily with the mission of the MHRA, which is to tell the public what works.I think it is very di Ycult to see how they identied a public health interest in putting forward theseNational Rules. Can I just clarify that it is a NationalRules Scheme, that the EC Directive makesprovision for national agencies to introduce theirown national rules. Under the EC Directive it wouldhave been perfectly acceptable to requirehomeopathic products to go through the samelicensing procedures as other products if theywanted to make medicinal claims, so it was not theonly option. It was not simply reading o Vfrom the European Directive straight into UK law. Q47 Dr Iddon: Perhaps, for the record, you would give us the other options that MHRA gave toGovernment when they chose to go forward with theNational Rules Scheme?Ms Brown: The other options were to do nothing, and the problem that was identied prior to the 1968Medicines Act was that there were a number ofhomeopathic products which were granted aproduct licence of right, and they continued to besold on that basis, and then other products comingonto the market had had to use the SimpliedScheme, which had been introduced particularlyafter 1971 and the European Communityrequirements. The only reason for Evidence Ev 15 25 November 2009 Mr Paul Bennett, Ms Tracey Brown, Mr Ben Goldacre, Professor Jayne Lawrence and Mr Robert Wilson (and this is the description given by a MHRA to Government) was that sections of the homeopathicindustry were unhappy with what they saw as not alevel playing eld, where the PLRs could makeclaims and the new products could not make claims.Another version of doing nothing would have beenoption two, which is to revoke the PLRs and requirethe medicine simply to go through the SimpliedScheme. That would mean that they would not beable to make medicinal claims. Again, that wouldhave been perfectly acceptable. Q48 Dr Iddon: Without the evidence? Ms Brown: Without the evidence. They could either go through the full application for a licence, in whichcase they would have to bring the same quality ofinformation about e Ycacy as any other medicine, or they could register under the Simplied Scheme,which was simply , as we have talked about,manufacturing safety . Q49 Dr Iddon: That would have levelled the playing eld between the various homeopathic products? Ms Brown: It would have done, but, clearly , the manufacturers of those products which were beingsold with medicinal claims would not have been veryhappy at having to lose the ability to make thosemedicinal claims on their products. So that section,in eVect, would have lost out of the homeopathic industry . Q50 Dr Iddon: But the other section of the industry , who sell vitamins and minerals, will be put underthat pressure. It seems a contradiction that thehomeopathic industry is not put under the samepressure. Ms Brown: Yes, it certainly does. Options three and four are not that dissimilar. Option three was tointroduce National Rules and option four similarly;there are just some di Verences between the requirements. I nd it very di Ycult to make sense of these options, because from a public health point ofview none of these options has a rationale in termsof public health, they all have a rationale in terms ofthe industry , and, in fact, that becomes much clearerwhen you look at the rationale that was given togovernment. The only rationale for governmentintervention given by the MHRA was \"although thedevelopment of National Rules by Member Statesunder Directive 2001/83 is optional\"\u2014just to makethat point clear\u2014\"failing to introduce a schemewould inhibit the expansion of the homeopathicindustry by the prevention of the development ofnew products with indications\". So that is why theypreferred option four\u2014it allowed indications andlevelled the playing eld for the industry; there wasno other justication. Q51 Dr Iddon: Robert, it just seems to me, and possibly other members of the Committee, that theNational Rules Scheme was produced by theMHRA to allow your industry to expand. What isthe evidence since the National Rules Scheme was introduced? Have your product lists grown and haveyou expanded?Mr Wilson: Again, I think this is something that needs to be made clear. Currently under the NationalRules Scheme there is one licence that has gonethrough that process since 2006. We submitted adossier for arnica in 2007 and it was granted to us inMarch 2009, so you are talking about one product inthe whole of the UK homeopathic industry . TheNational Rules Scheme is implemented by the UKbut there are clear understandings from Europe thatindications on products for homeopathic use whichhave been around since the start of the variousMedical Acts in all the countries need to beregularised, and this was a way of bringing productsthat had been on the market for over 30 years intoa standard way that could come across Europe. Thehomeopathic industry has been in quite seriousdecline because there has been a huge amount ofnegative PR about homeopathy built on a lot ofspurious trials and the homeopathic voice has notbeen allowed to be heard. If I could make one point,in 2005 the NHS prescriptions for homeopathics was500,000; in 2007 it was 320,000. Q52 Chairman: I want to come on to that separately; so please do not take us down that road. BenGoldacre, in terms of responding to Brian Iddon'spoint, if, in fact, in France a signicant amount of\"homeopathic medicines\" are being prescribed, theFrench do not seem to be dying in droves as a resultof it. Why on earth should we bother? Why do wenot just say perhaps they have got something that isgoing which we should have?Dr Goldacre: I agree. I do not think it is the most important issue in the world. I do not think peopletaking homeopathic pills is very important, but Ithink the MHRA endorsing them is extremelyproblematic. In answer to Dr Iddon's question whythey would be interested, the MHRA is the regulatorof the pharmaceutical industry but it gets, as Iunderstand it, 90 per cent of its income from thepharmaceutical industry and much of that incomecomes in the form of product licence applications,and so on\u2014the fees that they charge for processingthem\u2014and when they say that they are passing anew regulation to enable the expansion of thehomeopathic industry , I think, unfortunately , thatsends out a clear message that this is a \u00a31.5 billionEuropean industry that is able to influence theactivities of an industry regulator, and that isproblematic.Chairman: That is very cynical. Q53 Graham Stringer: Is the denition of homeopathy in France exactly the same as it is inthis country?Dr Goldacre: Yes, it is sugar pills that have been treated ceremonially , if you like, but I do not believethat Robert Wilson, who is a manufacturer ofhomeopathic pills, could tell the di Verence between one of his arnica pills and one of his arsenic pills;they Technology Committee: Evidence 25 November 2009 Mr Paul Bennett, Ms Tracey Brown, Mr Ben Goldacre, Professor Jayne Lawrence and Mr Robert Wilson Q54 Ian Stewart: Is that the formal denition in the UK and in France? The question you were askedwas: is the denition the same? You gave whatappeared to me to be a personal denition. That wasnot the question you were asked.Dr Goldacre: I would imagine that there would be a huge number of di Verent denitions in France and in England. Q55 Ian Stewart: That is a very di Verent answer than you gave to Graham Stringer before.Dr Goldacre: There is no substantively di Verent understanding of the meaning of the word\"homeopathic\" between France and England. Q56 Chairman: Professor Lawrence, in terms of the Pharmaceutical Society , I presume there is anequivalent of the Royal Pharmaceutical Society inFrance?Professor Lawrence: Yes, there is. Q57 Chairman: Why are they not jumping up and down, or are you just so much better?Professor Lawrence: I am sorry? Q58 Chairman: Is yours so much more a professional organisation in the UK? Are they a little bitbackward in France?Professor Lawrence: No, the organisations are actually quite di Verent. Although they are national societies, I think the Pharmaceutical Society is ratherunique in being, up until recently , or presently , boththe regulator and a professional body . So there is adiVerence between the societies across Europe. Chairman: Can I move on then to Tim Boswell. Q59 Mr Boswell: Some questions about the role of pharmacists in this, and I am talking aboutpharmacists as pharmacists rather than as retailers.Could I invite the panel to go straight down the lineand give me a one word or one sentence answer tothis question, starting with Paul and proceeding:should pharmacists sell homeopathic products?Mr Bennett: Yes. Ms Brown: No. Dr Goldacre: Yes, but they should not say they are eVective. Professor Lawrence: Yes, but they should not say they are e Vective. Mr Wilson: Yes. Q60 Mr Boswell: Following on from that, perhaps I could ask Professor Lawrence to lead and others tofeel they can join in. Questions about the role ofpharmacists specically . Can you explain to us howpharmacists assist patients in making informeddecisions, as they would do in relation to othermedicines, by providing them with the necessaryrelevant information about homeopathy?Professor Lawrence: I think the rst thing to realise is that the homeopathic preparations sold inpharmacies are over-the-counter products. So it ispossible for a patient to just walk up, take a productoVthe shelf and buy it. We would contest it is betterfor the patient for pharmacists to be present when that happens, because they are able, if appropriate,to o Ver advice to that patient, and there are two things that are important. It is important thatpatients should realise there is not any evidence forthe particular preparations and, also, it gives thepharmacist an opportunity to ensure that the patientis not actually taking something unnecessarily .Somebody mentioned before about takinginappropriate medicine. If they come into apharmacy , they can have a consultation and thepharmacist can check it is not inappropriate. Q61 Mr Boswell: So if you present with a particular condition, say , as it has been mentioned,constipation, for the sake of argument, there is nosort of implied either nancial or other pressurewhich the pharmacist would feel to a homeopathic product?Professor Lawrence: No. Q62 Mr Boswell: Or to make claims for the e Ycacy of that product which would not otherwise bescientically justied?Professor Lawrence: No, that would go against the pharmacists' Code of Ethics. Q63 Mr Boswell: Would anyone else like to comment on that specic line of questioning? If there is not,could I ask this. Often the di Yculty arises in delivery , however well the Royal Society has set out its stall,and you have, as you have rightly said, drawn upethical guidelines. How can you ensure as a RoyalSociety that pharmacists selling homeopathicremedies are adhering to those guidelines? Can youdiscipline people? Is there any evidence ofdisciplining where people have gone outside therules?Professor Lawrence: There are two ways a pharmacist might be disciplined. One of them isthrough the Society's inspectorate which visits theshops on an occasional basis, and one of their roles isto check that the pharmacists are adhering to ethicalguidelines. So it might be picked up there and, if it is,it might just initially be a warning, but if that is notcomplied with, it would go to\u2014 Q64 Mr Boswell: There have actually been cases where there has been a warning in relation tohomeopathic products that you are aware of?Professor Lawrence: Not from the inspectorate, but the other way is from complaints from perhaps amember of the public, and they would beinvestigated, and there has been a case recentlywhere it did go to a tness to practise case. Q65 Mr Boswell: Do you want to comment on that, Paul, from the point of view of a largepharmaceutical retailer?Mr Bennett: Talking in general terms, clearly pharmacists are trained healthcare professionals,they are members of the Royal PharmaceuticalSociety , which is a regulated profession, and clearlyaspire to very high professional Evidence Ev 17 25 November 2009 Mr Paul Bennett, Ms Tracey Brown, Mr Ben Goldacre, Professor Jayne Lawrence and Mr Robert Wilson within our own business we would supplement that with standard operating procedures and providetraining material and facilitate the development ofprofessional capability of our individualpharmacists. It is really very important thatpharmacists adhere to the professional code at alltimes and, if I can, I would just like to quote fromsome guidance from the Royal PharmaceuticalSociety which I think is succinct but very relevant tothis point. That guidance states: \"Pharmacistsproviding homeopathic therapies have aprofessional responsibility only to o Ver advice if they have undertaken suitable training or havespecialised knowledge,\" and further (and my lastpoint): \"Pharmacists should consider whether anysymptoms described by the patient and for whichthey are taking a homeopathic preparation could beassociated with a serious or life-threateningunderlying condition. If in doubt, refer the patient toa general practitioner.\" Q66 Mr Boswell: I have two questions arising from that, if I may . The rst one is: do you haveoperational experience if a particular employee ofyours who is a pharmacist is \"pushing\" homeopathicremedies or might be inclined to disregard some ofthe small print of the code? Do you actually havecases where you have had to discipline or retrainpeople where this has happened that you are awareof? Mr Bennett: Not at all. Our pharmacists take their responsibility very , very seriously . I have not, asSuperintendent Pharmacist within Boots UK,encountered that circumstance at all. Q67 Mr Boswell: Did you want to say something, Tracey? Ms Brown: I did want to say that, whilst Boots' experience may be that (and it is an on-goingsituation that I cannot give you details of), there is asituation that has arisen where we discovered onelarge high street pharmacist was selling homeopathic anti-malarial Mr Boswell: Without scientic evidence. Ms Brown: Certainly so, and that, in fact, in one case was making appointments for a homeopathic travelclinic providing anti-malarial prophylaxis. That issomething that the looking into. Q69 Dr Harris: Is looking into! I am amazed, because this was July 2006. Pharmacists, ontelevision\u2014I saw this programme\u2014said, yes, if youwant to avoid malaria, you have a malaria-sized holein your aura, take this homeopathic remedy\u2014noadvice on bed mosquito nets or proper malarialprophylaxis\u2014and Dr Brown has just said that youare still looking at that. I would have thought that isan emergency , is it not? I think there were tenpharmacists doing that. Professor Lawrence: I really cannot comment on the disciplinary procedure, unfortunately .Q70 Mr Boswell: But it is on-going. Just to conrm, it is not resolved or you are not aware of it.Professor Lawrence: I cannot comment. Q71 Dr Harris: Wait a minute. Forget those cases. Can you give me the assurance that the people youregulate on behalf of the public are not sellinghomeopathic anti-malarial prophylaxis in theabsence of conventional evidence-based prophylaxisand advice on bed nets?Professor Lawrence: Obviously I cannot assure you that every pharmacy is not, but I can assure you thatthe pharmaceutical society has made it very clear toits members that it is completely inappropriate to usehomeopathy for the treatment of malaria. Q72 Dr Harris: They should be struck o Vif they do. Professor Lawrence: Yes. 1 Q73 Mr Boswell: That is helpful. To come back to Paul Bennett, presumably , statistically within a largeorganisation some of your pharmacists willthemselves be interested in homeopathic remediesfor self-medication, as it were. Is there any evidenceat all, that you are aware of, of the individual whomight be pushing a homeopathic solution becausethey are, as it were, committed to it?Mr Bennett: I would have no evidence to support that assertion at all. Q74 Chairman: Yes, Ben? Dr Goldacre: I just want to say very briefly that I think very widespread anecdotal evidence is that ifyou ask a pharmacist, including in Boots, for adviceand you say that you are interested in homeopathicpills then you will get advice that is certainly not inkeeping with the evidence. I know that ProfessorDavid Colquhoun recently went into six pharmaciesand said: \"I've got a ve-year old who has had threedays of diarrhoea and I would like an alternativetreatment\", and in all but one case\u2014and I thinkthese were Boots pharmacies\u2014he was told about ahomeopathic pill. Q75 Mr Boswell: Can I just be clear because I may have misheard you. You are suggesting that thepotential patient or customer has self-declared aninterest in homeopathic medicine before this isprescribed? You are not saying that if I walk in, nothaving made any commitment and just say: \"I havea problem; my child is ill\" that it will be \"pushed\" toyou? I just want to be clear of the di Verence. Dr Goldacre: They have expressed an interest but they are not getting accurate and impartialinformation. Q76 Mr Boswell: Can I just round up and ask Robert Wilson a couple of questions. You chair the BAHM.How do you ensure that member companies complywith the MHRA regulations on labelling andmarketing? 1Note by witness: this is a matter for the tness to practice panel and may result in a striking o Vthe register if the case Technology Committee: Evidence 25 November 2009 Mr Paul Bennett, Ms Tracey Brown, Mr Ben Goldacre, Professor Jayne Lawrence and Mr Robert Wilson Mr Wilson: All of our members have what are called GMP licences, which are good manufacturinglicences. They are inspected by the MHRA on a two-year basis; so every two years. Q77 Mr Boswell: This is primarily about safety? Mr Wilson: Safety and making sure that all the labelling is in line. All our members are licensed andthe products they sell are all licensed, and there is avery rigorous set of disciplines that you have to gothrough to make sure of that and there is also achecking mechanism with the MHRA regularly . Allour labels are approved by them; all our leaflets areapproved by them. So everything that goes out frommany of our members would have been\u2014 Q78 Mr Boswell: Is there much evidence of complaint or failure to comply with that, or not?Mr Wilson: None whatsoever. Q79 Mr Boswell: Final question: it is slightly more numinous but I think it might be appropriate to clearit now. In making the case for homeopathicremedies, which you made, and we have had adiscussion about evidence, which is our primaryconcern today , are you at all attracted by theargument (I have to admit I have used it myself inrelation to organic farming, where you get the samekinds of arguments about what is or is not evidence)or do you ever use the argument that it is quiteimportant for the scientic community to have thatbody of practice in place, irrespective of theevidence, in order, perhaps, that some evidencemight emerge at a later stage? In other words, whenyou are looking at the case for homeopathy is thisnot just a matter of the particular products at theparticular time but, also, as it were, having a body ofcustom and practice which is at least in existenceseparately from conventional medicine and can beassessed against it from time to time?Mr Wilson: I think it is very important that homeopathic community makes the case that we arevery much pro-research, but, as I said earlier, it hasto be good research. Also, this discussion aboutplacebo, I think, is a very interesting one becausethere are a great deal of things within orthodoxmedicine that people do not understand\u2014forinstance, anaesthetics; they do not know whyanaesthetics work but it does not mean that they donot work. The same with electro-shock therapy , orECT; the schizophrenia treatments,benzodiazepines\u2014there are lots and lots of areas ofconventional medicine where they do notunderstand the mechanism but that does not meanyou do not use them. Q80 Dr Harris: Would you agree that where you do not understand the mechanism, or the proposedmechanism does not make scientic sense, there is ahigher onus to show e Vectiveness than in medicines where there is good evidence and there is a very clearknowledge? So, if anything, the evidence base onhomeopathy should be stronger because of theimplausible scientic basis for it.Mr Wilson: I would agree entirely on that, but I come back to the question of who will pay for this?One important point to make is that we do not havepatents at the end of our process; we have genericmedicines. Anyone can make an Arnica pill, and weare very small\u2014my business in homeopathies is \u00a35million in this country; we are not talking abouthuge multinationals here. Who is going to pay forthis research? Some of the good research\u2014and thereis a lot of good research\u2014in Germany has beenfunded, interestingly , by some of the healthcareinsurance companies, and this Witt Trial that I madereference to has shown, and it was funded by thehealthcare companies because they wanted to seewas it worth their while funding homeopathiesthrough private health insurance, and the answerscame back that, actually , it was cost-e Vective\u2014not just on cost, it was e Vective for the patient. Q81 Chairman: I just wanted to pin you down. Ainsworth is one of your members, is it not?Mr Wilson: It is, yes. Q82 Chairman: It sells a Swine Flu Formula\u2014 \"Swine Pneumonia 36C\" online. Is it still doing it?Mr Wilson: I understand that we had words with them about removing that. However, I am not sure.Dr Harris: Kind words? Q83 Chairman: Even though that was clearly quite a dangerous product to be selling, given the pandemicwhich is sweeping the world, you are still happy tosell that through one of your members?Mr Wilson: No, absolutely not. Q84 Ian Stewart: Can I start at this end and work through and just ask: can any of you saycategorically that homeopathy does not work in anycircumstances to reduce illness, ailments or adverseconditions?Mr Bennett: Again, it is back to the evidence point. So I could not categorically say it does not work, andI know that there is a strong belief in a number ofpeople that it is e Ycacious. Q85 Ian Stewart: So, for you, there is no evidence to show that it works but there is no evidence to showthat it does not work. Is that right?Mr Bennett: Correct. Ms Brown: I think that misunderstands what the placebo e Vect is. The placebo e Vect is very powerful and people do heal, and this accounts for the e Vects of a lot of medicines\u2014or a certain part of theireVects. I think that you would expect to see people benet from taking a placebo. Q86 Ian Stewart: Let me help you. I did understand the placebo e Vect. Other than the placebo e Vect, can you answer my question?Ms Brown: I have not seen any evidence to suggest there is any systematic benet beyond Evidence Ev 19 25 November 2009 Mr Paul Bennett, Ms Tracey Brown, Mr Ben Goldacre, Professor Jayne Lawrence and Mr Robert Wilson Q87 Ian Stewart: That is not what I asked; I asked if you could categorically say that it does not work?Ms Brown: Yes. Insofar as I can categorically say anything in this life, I would say yes.Dr Goldacre: There have now been around 200 trials of homeopathy against placebo sugar pills and,taken collectively , they show that there is no evidencethat homeopathy pills are any better than a placebo.So I would say , on the basis of that, that they do notand, also, that it is not worth doing any moreplacebo controlled trials because you would bethrowing good money after bad and you would haveto have a huge number of very strongly positive trialsto outweigh all of the negative ones.Professor Lawrence: I agree there is no evidence on controlled trials. However, patients do feel benet,and I think that may come from the fact that whenthey go to a homeopathy practitioner, often, theyhave a consultation and there are others thingsassociated with treatment other than pills, in somecases. Q88 Ian Stewart: Does that mean, Jayne, that you cannot categorically say it does not work?Professor Lawrence: In randomised controlled trials I categorically say it does not work. Q89 Dr Iddon: How do you interpret the arnica trials that Robert Wilson was mentioning? Have I have not seen that. Q91 Dr Iddon: Bruising is a physically observable eVect and he is claiming that arnica reduces bruising quicker in a random controlled trial with people inwho do not have any application of medicine.Professor Lawrence: I have not seen the data so I really cannot comment on the trial. However, as Bensaid before, you will always get some positive andnegative trials, and you have to take overall theresults. Q92 Ian Stewart: Paul, can I start with you again\u2014 Mr Wilson: Can I just come in? Actually , there was a trial by Mollinger et al in April this year whichshowed that \"patients given homeopathic remediesshowed responses characteristic of those expectedfrom the remedy , while those given natural placebosdid not. This points to a genuine homeopathic e Vect rather than a mere placebo response.\" I am veryhappy to submit any of the things I have mentionedto the Committee afterwards. Just one other thingon a more personal level: teething granules\u2014ateething product we give for babies, which is one ofour bestsellers and is recommended highly bypharmacists because it is e Vective. Babies do not manifest the placebo e Vect and mothers continue to buy this product enormously because they see itworking and working incredibly quickly .Q93 Ian Stewart: Can I start again at your end, please, Paul? Is there any evidence that patients arebeing put at risk from unregulated homeopaths?Mr Bennett: Absolutely no evidence that I am aware of, and if there was we would probably act on that.Ms Brown: From unregulated homeopaths? Q94 Ian Stewart: Yes. Ms Brown: Meaning they are not professionally registered homeopaths?Ian Stewart: I will say it again\u2014in an e Vort to get balance into these questions\u2014is there any evidencethat patients are being put at risk from unregulatedhomeopaths? I will bring in some other questions.Dr Harris: The question is in the context of a proposal to regulate them\u2014 Q95 Chairman: I am sorry , Dr Harris; a colleague is asking his questions, and I want him to ask them.Ms Brown: If you are referring to the professional registration as regulation then I have not seen anyevidence to suggest a signicant di Verence between regulated and unregulated. They are currentlyunregulated. The di Verence I have seen, referring back to the anti-malarial prophylaxis issue, was thatat the time we tested, having found that variouspharmacies were willing to provide anti-malarialprophylaxis and homeopathies with consultations,we tested also whether a similar thing would happenif you consulted GPs who also practisedhomeopathy , or people who were medically trained,and the answer was no; we did not nd (I cannotcategorically say) anybody with a medical trainingwho was willing to prescribe homeopathic anti-malarial prophylaxis. Q96 Ian Stewart: Maybe for Ben's benet and the others, I have spent the last four years working withthe British Acupuncture Council and the TraditionalChinese Medicine Association, on the basis ofdeveloping the regulation that has just beenimplemented by the Government. So I am verymuch in favour of appropriate regulation andsafeguards. The question that then follows\u2014andperhaps the others will take this intoconsideration\u2014is: how do you determine between agood homeopath and a bad homeopath, in thecurrent circumstances?Ms Brown: Anybody o Vering medical advice, I believe, needs to have medical training. I think thatthe best way of ensuring that patient care is at itsoptimal is to ensure that they have medical training.Dr Goldacre: It is not entirely clear to me what is being asked. Q97 Ian Stewart: The question is that whenever a patient goes to a pharmacy or any other outlet and isoVered homeopathic remedies, whether that is being done on the basis as explained by Paul earlier\u2014thisis a worse situation for the patient than if it was aregulated and licensed situation?Dr Goldacre: It depends how well they are regulated, but Professor Ernst has shown that the Society ofHomeopaths are not adequately Technology Committee: Evidence 25 November 2009 Mr Paul Bennett, Ms Tracey Brown, Mr Ben Goldacre, Professor Jayne Lawrence and Mr Robert Wilson own members at present and that they make claims which breach their own regulations. The evidence ofthe Sense About Science and Newsnight stint, if you like, where they went to ten homeopaths and foundthat nine out of ten were happy to give advice onmalaria\u2014I do not imagine that a problem like thatwill go away just because of regulation; I think thereis a deeply ingrained systemic problem with peoplewho believe that sugar pills are medically e Vective. I think you can tweak at the edges but, fundamentally ,when you are talking about people who believe thatsugar pills have medical e Vects without evidence then you are starting from a position that is actuallyquite di Ycult to reason with. Q98 Ian Stewart: In our brieng, Ben, we had it explained that homeopathy claims that water has amemory . In the statement that we received againsthomeopathy it said that if that was true it would turnthe science upside down. Do you agree with that?Dr Goldacre: Physics is not really anything that interests me; I do not know if it would turn the worldupside down, but the bottom line is it does notmatter about the mechanism by which homeopathyis claimed to work or does not work; it does notwork. Q99 Ian Stewart: Are you sure it is not just the level of knowledge and understanding we have at thispoint in time? I remember the story about Niels Bohrgoing to Max Planck and saying: \"Nobody acceptsmy theories and work\" and Max Planck saying tohim: \"You'll need to wait till they die before you areaccepted\". Is this not the same case here; that theevidence just is not there yet?Dr Goldacre: No. I think 200 trials which, taken collectively , showed that homeopathy pills workedno better than a placebo is very good evidenceagainst homeopathy . Q100 Ian Stewart: Do you accept Robert Wilson's critique of those trials?Dr Goldacre: No. What Robert Wilson has done is exaggerate what homeopaths\u2014 Q101 Ian Stewart: I am sorry , do you accept his answer that those trials were done in aninsignicant sample?Dr Goldacre: No, and the criticisms that he made did not hold up. For example, it is the smaller, poorerquality trials which he criticises which are morelikely to give a result that favours homeopathy , andit is when you remove those smaller and less e Vective trials that homeopathy is shown to be no moreeVective than placebo. What Mr Wilson has done on several occasions today is pull out individual trials.It is a basic, central tenet of evidence-based medicinethat you cannot pull out individual trials which goagainst the grain of what the totality of the evidenceshows. You would not accept that for any medicaltreatment. Q102 Ian Stewart: Jayne, would you like to comment?Professor Lawrence: There were several questions there. Which one do you want me to answer?Ian Stewart: You choose. Q103 Chairman: The most interesting! Professor Lawrence: First of all, I think the Pharmaceutical Society would recommend someregulation of homeopaths, because while we are surea lot of homeopaths are responsible there are anumber of them that do make irresponsible claims,and I think it is very important that that is actuallystopped. Q104 Ian Stewart: Is it fair to say that that is the same in any discipline?Professor Lawrence: Yes. With respect to the science issue, I think it probably would be revolutionary ifhomeopathy was proved to be right, because it doesgo against a lot of fundamental understanding ofscience as it stands at the moment. Q105 Ian Stewart: Is that what subatomic particle physics did for Newtonian physics?Professor Lawrence: I do not know. There is the question of dark matter at the moment\u2014that mayturn science on its head as well. Q106 Ian Stewart: Robert, do you want to conclude? Mr Wilson: Just on your science question, I think you have hit the nail on the head; that we just havenot yet understood these highly dilute substances.Two points: it is interesting that since the mapping ofthe human genome we are now talking aboutbespoke remedy , or medicines, for cancer treatment;not a blanket cancer treatment. Hahnemann talkedabout treating the person not the disease 200 yearsago. Secondly , with highly diluted substances, again,we are now pushing at the boundaries of this. Someof the drugs used in psychosis and in mentalconditions are using extremely high dilutions. So Ibelieve that we will nd the answers to whyhomeopathy works because, clearly , in our view, itdoes work and there is a lot of evidence. I am not justcherry-picking because the other side, equally ,cherry-picks. I would say , again, that as far as thehomeopathic industry is concerned we wouldwelcome research. Q107 Dr Harris: What are your scientic Can I answer your second question? Q108 Chairman: I will let you have the last word, Dr Harris.Mr Wilson: On regulation, obviously I work for the manufacturers\u2014I represent the manufacturers heretoday\u2014but we would strongly support regulation. Ifyou look at, for instance, the osteopaths, who haveset up a very strong regulatory body of their own, Ithink it is a shining example that has beneted theosteopaths, because all of their members areregulated by the same authority , and the patientsknow that they have got the protection Evidence Ev 21 25 November 2009 Mr Paul Bennett, Ms Tracey Brown, Mr Ben Goldacre, Professor Jayne Lawrence and Mr Robert Wilson behind them. So I think the osteopaths are an example of a very successful complementary systemthat is working well with regulation at its centre.Chairman: At least we have found one point of agreement, that better regulation would help. Youhave, literally , 30 seconds. Q109 Dr Harris: You opined, Mr Wilson, on the dilution of anti-psychotics and other treatments formental health. I was just wondering what yourscientic qualications were. I know you are anexpert in marketing and manufacturing ofhomeopathic medicines, but I was wondering whatyour scientic qualications were that made youcondent to opine on the science and thepharmacology of anti-psychotics.Mr Wilson: What interests me are arguments within conventional medicine that resonate with some ofthe principles of homeopathy . One of the greatstumbling blocks that homeopathy has today is itsdilution. That is the central question\u2014 Q110 Dr Harris: I was just asking whether you have any qualications. Memorandum submitted by Dr Peter Fisher (HO 21) HOMEOPATHY: THE EVIDENCE FROM BASIC RESEARCH Background 1. Its \"implausibility\" from a scientic standpoint is often cited as a reason for scepticism about homeopathy , even in the face of positive clinical evidence. For instance a systematic review of clinical trials,published in the BMJ stated \"we would accept that homeopathy can be e Ycacious, if its mechanism of action were more plausible\" [1]. Contrary views have also been expressed: \"Indeed it is often stated...that the burden of proof it requires should be much greater than for other scientic hypotheses. Such an attitude may itselfbe considered unscientic: the same level of supporting evidence should be accepted for all scienticdevelopments. If a lower level of proof is set for hypotheses that t prior beliefs then we bias our view ofscience in favour of such beliefs and may be easily misled\". [2] 2. This submission examines the basic science evidence concerning homeopathy and related areas of science to cast light on the alleged implausibility of homeopathy . 3. Homeopathy is based on the idea of \"like cures like\", also known as the similarity principle. Medicines are selected on the basis that they may , in healthy people, provoke syndromes similar to those from whichthe patient is su Vering. Homeopathy emphasises the \"secondary\" e Vects of medicines, these are the reactions of living systems to drugs, as opposed to the primary actions of drugs per se. 4. The most controversial aspect of homeopathy is its use of very high dilution. These are prepared by a process of sequential dilution with vigorous shaking at each stage of dilution, known as succussion. Dilutionis usually in steps of 1:10 or 1:100, referred to as x or d (decimal) or c (centesimal) respectively . 5. Avogadro's Constant (also known as Loschmidt's Constant) is the number of particles (atoms or molecules) in a gram mole of a pure substance. Its value is 6.02 x 10 23mol-1. The implication is that material quantities of the original substance are extremely unlikely to remain in homeopathic medicines diluted toconcentrations greater 12c or 24x (10 -24M). Such dilutions are referred to as are referred to as \"ultramolecular\" or BRAN (Beyond the Reciprocal of Avogadro's Number). 6. It is important to note that the use of ultramolecular dilutions is not a dening characteristic of homeopathy . Many homeopathic medicines are not in ultramolecular dilutions. 7. It is sometimes claimed that it is impossible for such highly diluted substances to have \"real\" physiological e Vects. Randomised placebo-controlled trials are, in principle, capable of demonstrating such eVects for homeopathic medicines. But they are expensive, cumbersome and di Ycult to repeat. The question of whether extreme dilutions are capable of exerting \"real\" (as opposed to psychologically mediated) e Vects, and if so, how such e Vects might be mediated is best answered by laboratory experiments.Mr Wilson: I have none other than an interest and having spent 25 years in this eld. Q111 Dr Harris: Finally , you said that you regretted that in recent years the volume of sales had reducedbecause of what you described as \"attacks\" on homeopathy from the science community . Wouldyou say that, if the scientic community think theyhave the data, that is probably a good thing? Is itnot? You could say that that is an e Vect of memory of data versus memory of water; that people aremaking data-based decisions.Mr Wilson: Yes, I think my view is that we need to have more research into homeopathy; research thatcan stand up to some of the criticisms that have beenplaced at it.Dr Harris: We should continue to do research until it shows it works?Chairman: On that note we will call this session to a halt because I think that is something else we canagree on, that more research would help. Saved bythe bell. Can I thank our panel very , very muchindeed. It is a di Ycult area but you have done brilliantly this morning, and we thank you Evidence 8. This submission focuses on: \u2014 Scientic research on \"like cures like\".\u2014 Evidence from biological experiments that very high dilutions can have e Vects. This includes work based on intact animals, plants and isolated cells and cell cultures. \u2014 Research concerning possible ways in which such e Vects might be mediated, this is mostly in the form of physical and physical chemistry research. Similarity 9. The primary principle of homeopathy is that of similarity . In this area there is substantial overlap with other areas of science including toxicology and pharmacology . 10. In Toxicology hormesis, the stimulatory or benecial e Vects of small doses of toxins [3,4,5,6]has been extensively studied. The recent concept of \"postconditioning hormesis\" refers to a small stimulus exertinga benecial e Vect after a biological system has experienced a harmful stress of similar nature. [7] 11. The main competing toxicological hypothesis to hormesis is the threshold dose response model. This model predicts that the e Vects of a toxin decline in a linear fashion with reducing dose; hormesis predicts a J-shaped or \"hockey stick\" curve, with a reverse e Vect at low dose levels. Analysis of a very large dataset of a standard cancer drug screening method based on yeast show the hormesis model to be more accurate inpredicting response at low doses. [8] 12. Wiegant's group at the University of Utrecht, Netherlands studied the specicity of low dose responses in cultured rat hepatoma cells. The cells were subjected to heat shock followed by low doses ofchemical toxins. The greater the similarity between the two stresses, the greater the cell survival. [9] 13. Relevant pharmacological concepts include drug rebound e Vects, dose-dependent reverse e Vects and paradoxical pharmacology[10,11,12]. Such e Vects are very widely observed. For instance that -agonist drugs which stimulate the heart and have positive e Vects in acute heart failure, increase mortality in the chronic heart failure while the reverse is true for -antagonist drugs. 14. The toxicological and pharmacological phenomena mentioned above have in common the occurrence secondary , reverse or paradoxical e Vects of drugs and toxins in living organisms as a function of dose or time 15. In some cases the biological basis of these secondary reversed e Vects is understood: known mechanisms include \"chaperone\" protein induction, cell surface receptor up\u2014or down-regulation andenzyme induction. In other cases the mechanism is unknown. Biological Models of High Dilution Effects 16. A meta-analysis led by Prof Claudia Witt of the Charite \u00b4University Medical Centre, Berlin evaluated the quality and results of in-vitro biological experiments with ultramolecular stepwise agitated dilutions.Quality was assessed by a modied SAPEH score. 75 publications were found of which 33% werereplications. 73% showed an e Vect with ultramolecular dilutions including 68% of high quality experiments. 73% of replication experiments were also positive. [13] 17. The most frequently used in-vitro model was basophils, used in 42% of experiments. Basophils are white blood cells involved in the immune response. One series of experiments comprises 17 experiments onthe inhibition of basophil activation by high dilutions of histamine. It spans over 25 years and includes multi-centre and independent replications. [14,15,16]There has been steady renement of the method, including automation. All but two repetitions have reported positive results. There is growing insight into possiblemechanisms of action, for instance the response is highly specic to histamine. It is not induced by thestructural analogue histidine, and it is blocked by histamine antagonist drugs. Experiments with series ofdilutions show alternating peaks and troughs of e Vect at di Verent dilutions. The reason for this is not understood, but there is a consistent peak of activity at 16c (Histamine 10 -32M), well into the ultramolecular range 18. Another cellular system which has been the subject of repeated experiments over a long period is the eVect of ultramolecular dilutions of aspirin on blood clotting. The e Vect is the reverse of that found with substantial doses: ultramolecular dilutions promote clotting.[17,18]Recent work with \"knock-out\" mice demonstrates that the e Vect depends on the enzyme COX-2.[19] 19. Several white blood cell models indicate that homeopathic medicines modulate cytokine expression. These suggest testable hypotheses on the locus of in-vivo e Vects of homeopathic medicines.[20,21,22,23] 20. Among plant models the most reproduced is that examining the e Vects of ultramolecular, homeopathically diluted arsenic on arsenic-intoxicated wheat seedlings.[24,25,26] 21. The most robust animal model is the e Vect of thyroxine on the rate of metamorphosis of frogs. In substantial dose thyroxine increases the rate of metamorphosis, it has the reverse e Vect in ultramolecular dilution.[27], This e Vect has been reproduced in multi-centre experiments[28]and by independent workers Evidence Ev 23 22. Many other biological model experiments in homeopathy have been conducted. The HomBRex Database on Fundamental Homeopathy Research is maintained by the Carstens Foundation.[30]It contains details of approximately 1,300 such experiments using intact organisms or parts of organisms (includingorgans, cells, subcellular structures). The most commonly studied animal is the rat, used in 67 experiments.The most frequent type of model was intoxication, most frequently with arsenic. Other rat studies examinedbehaviour, oedema and inflammation and hormonal disturbances among others. There are also a numberof biological models including cell, plant and animal models which consistently show e Vects with ultramolecular dilutions of various biologically active substances including drugs, toxins, hormones andimmune mediators. 23. There is thus substantial scientic evidence that biologically active substances including drugs and toxins may have reversed or paradoxical secondary e Vects as a function of time or dose, and that these e Vects are highly specic. Possible Mechanisms of Action of Ultramolecular Dilutions 24. These ndings pose a challenge in terms of understanding the mechanism of action. Homeopathic medicines are prepared in water alcohol mixtures and most attention has focussed on structural or coherenceeVects induced in water by the preparation process. It has been suggested that hydrogen bond mediated structural or coherence e Vects, dissolved gases and perhaps dissolved silicates from the glassware play a role. 25. Experiments using a range of standard physical and physico-chemical methods have reported structural anomalies in water prepared according to the homeopathic method. Methods resonance (NMR). 26. Low temperature thermoluminesence involves freezing water to the temperature of liquid nitrogen, bombarding it with x- or y-rays, then warming it, whereupon it emits a characteristic glow. The \"signature\"of lithium is detectable in ultramolecular lithium chloride by this method [31]. This result has been independently veried.[32]The e Vect appears to be dependent on the atmosphere in which the dilution is conducted, the e Vect is more marked with dilutions prepared in an oxygen atmosphere and less so in dilutions prepared under reduced pressure, compared to normal atmosphere.[33] 27. The group led by Elia at the University of Naples has, over a decade published series of papers investigating physico-chemical properties of ultramolecular dilutions. They have detected, using standardmethods, anomalies of specic conductivity , heat of mixing and other parameters. [34,35,36]These ndings suggest the extended, ordered dynamics involving liquid water molecules, in the form of dissipativestructures, within such dilutions. Dissipative structures, described by the Nobel Laureate Ilya Prigogine, self-organising systems, far from thermodynamic equilibrium. [37]Within a dissipative structure there is long-range interaction between particles, and they exchange energy and matter with theirenvironment. Examples include cyclones, lasers and living organisms 28. NMR results have varied, depending on the parameters measured. [38,39]But when 20MHz T1 and T2 water dilutions of histamine aredistinguishable from solvents up to ultramolecular levels. The e Vect is attributed to stable supramolecular structures, involving nanobubbles of atmospheric gases and highly ordered water around them. It is deletedby heating. [40,41,42] 29. Work from the Materials Research Institute of Pennsylvania State University shows that ultradilute homeopathic medicines can be distinguished from controls and each other by Raman and Ultra-Violet-Visible (UV-VIS) spectroscopy [43,44]. These e Vects may be due to epitaxy , the transfer of information, not material, from the surface of one material, usually solid, to another, usually liquid. Semiconductormanufacturing often uses epitaxial growth to generate specic types of microtransistors and integratedcircuitry . 30. Diverse but standard physical and physico-chemical methods have detected structural anomalies of water in homeopathic preparations. There is convergence among the results which suggest mesoscale (of theorder of microns) organisation of water molecules in ultramolecular dilutions prepared by the homeopathicmethod. Dissolved gases may play an important role. It appears likely that this organisation is hydrogen-bond mediated. Criticisms 31. The claim that water can \"remember\" substances with which it has been in contact, and that such \"memory\" is mediated by hydrogen bonds has been criticised, mostly on theoretical grounds. [45]Such arguments mostly involve the short duration of individual hydrogen bonds in liquid water (about apicosecond). 32. But this does not imply that the mesoscale structure of water must change on the same time scale. For instance in ice hydrogen bonds are also very shortlived but an ice sculpture can \"remember\" its shape overextended periods. On a smaller scale, cation hydrates are commonly described with particular structure(eg the octahedral Na !(H2O) 6ion) even though the individual water molecules making up such structures have very brief residence times Technology Committee: Evidence 33. Such arguments ignore the fact that the behaviour of a large population of water molecules may be retained even if that of individual molecules is constantly changing: a wave can cross an ocean, remaininga wave although its molecular content is continuously changing. 34. Evidence denying the long life of water clusters is mostly based on computer simulations but these cover only nanoseconds of simulated time. Such short periods are insu Ycient to show longer temporal relationships, for example those produced by oscillating reactions. They also involve relatively few watermolecules (100-1000), small dimensions, insu Ycient to show mesoscale (micron) e Vects. They use models of the water molecule whose predictions correspond poorly to the real properties of water. 35. Certain \"memory\" e Vects in water are well established and uncontroversial: for instance the formation of clathrate hydrates from aqueous solutions whereby previously frozen clathrates within thesolution, when subsequently melted, predispose later to more rapid clathrate formation. [46]This is explained by the presence of nanobubbles, extended chain silicates or induced clathrate initiators.[47] Conclusions 36. I have examined basic science research of relevance to homeopathy with a view to establishing how \"implausible\" it is. I have briefly reviewed the evidence in three main domains: similarity , using toxicologicaland pharmacological sources; biological models of ultramolecular response, including isolated call, plantand whole animal models; possible mechanisms by which e Vects of ultramolecular dilutions might be mediated, drawing on physical, physico-chemical and materials science. 37. Toxicological and pharmacological phenomena such as hormesis, drug rebound e Vects and paradoxical pharmacology are very widely observed. They have in common the occurrence secondary ,reverse or paradoxical e Vects of drugs and toxins in living organisms as a function of dose or time and are closely analogous to the homeopathic concept of secondary drug action. 38. There is a substantial body of work on the e Vects of ultramolecular dilutions in various biological models, including isolated cells, plants and animals. Several lines of research now yield repeatable results.These include inhibition of basophil activation by the Vect of ultramolecular dilutions of aspirin on blood clotting; and the e Vect of ultramolecular thyroxine on the rate of metamorphosis of frogs. Several models suggest loci for these e Vects. 39. Experiments using a range of standard physical and physico-chemical methods have detected structural anomalies of water in ultramolecular homeopathic preparations. Raman and Ultra-Violet-Visiblespectroscopy and Nuclear Magnetic resonance. 40. The contention that homeopathy is implausible, impossible or isolated from other areas of science is untenable. Although the total volume of research in the area is relatively small, high-quality and repeatedexperiments have yielded positive results. These raise important and unanticipated scientic questions.

Dr Peter Fisher Director of ResearchRoyal London Homoeopathic Hospital November 2009 Memorandum submitted by Professor Edzard Ernst (HO 16) Many years ago, I have worked as a homeopath and therefore understand the concepts of homeopathy (eg like cures like and dilution increases e Vectiveness). These concepts are not supported by science and most homeopaths would probably admit that. However, they claim that several in vitro experiments suggest thatthe homeopathic dilution process does demonstrably alter the structure of water. The counter-arguments arethat this only happens for nano-seconds; it also does not explain how such dilutions generate health e Vects in vivo; nor does it explain why (water-free) globuli used widely in homeopathy should be e Vective. Homeopaths claim that, while we do not understand how their remedies work, clinical evidence shows that they work. The truth, however, is that systematic reviews or meta-analyses of the totality of the clinical data fail to show that homeopathic remedies generate clinical e Vects beyond those of placebo. Homeopaths counter by criticising the methodology of the latest Lancet meta-analyses by Shang et al . This, however, ignores the fact that over a dozen similar systematic evaluations have all come to the same Ev 27 Homeopaths furthermore claim that animal studies also show the e Vectiveness of homeopathic remedies. This implies that they must be more than placebos. Yet, if one reviews the totality of these data, a pictureemerges which closely resembles the human trial data alluded to above. Homeopaths also often refer to large observational studies, for instance, one from the Bristol Homeopathic Hospital, which imply that x70% of patients improve after homeopathic treatment. Such \"real life\" studies and their years of experience, they claim, is more meaningful than clinical trials. Yet thediscrepancy between the two sets of results is easy to explain: the patients in observational studies improvedbecause of placebo-e Vects, regression towards the mean, concomitant treatments and many other confounders. In clinical trials, all of these factors are eliminated and therefore no di Verences are observed between homeopathic remedies and placebos. Finally homeopaths claim that their approach is risk-free. This is, clearly not true. Highly dilute homeopathic remedies may well be free of side-e Vects. But forfeiting or delaying e Vective treatments, as homeopathy often does, can cause real harm. This issue is not well-researched, except for one particular area:many studies have conrmed that (lay) homeopaths tend to discourage parents from immunizing theirchildren, often recommending using homeopathic vaccinations (which are ine Vective) instead. In conclusion, there is no good evidence to suggest that homeopathic remedies have any specic therapeutic e Vects and there is some evidence to show that homeopathy can cause harm. Thus its risk-benet prole is negative. E Ernst MD, PhD, F Med Sci, FSB, FRCP , FRCPEd Complementary MedicinePeninsula Medical SchoolUniversities of Exeter & Plymouth November 2009 Supplementary memorandum submitted by Professor Edzard Ernst (HO 16a) In the document submitted on 5 November 2009, I stated that \"systematic reviews or meta-analyses of the totality of the clinical trial data fail to show that homeopathic remedies generate clinical e Vects beyond those of placebo\". This is an appendix substantiating this claim which I ask to be attached to my previouslysubmitted evidence. 1. S ystematic Reviews of Homeopathy In 2002, I published a summary 1of all systematic reviews that emerged after Linde's positive Lancet meta- analysis (rst row in Table 1). Six re-analyses of Linde's data\u2014including two by Linde himself [never citedby homeopaths!]\u2014arrived at a less than positive conclusion (Table 1). Furthermore, 11 new and independentsystematic reviews published after Linde's article also fail to conclude that homeopathy is e Vective (Table 2). Since the publication of my article 1, further negative systematic reviews have appeared, eg the well-known one by Shang et al in the Lancet2and our review of homeopathy for childhood conditions.3 2. S hang et al Probably , the review by Shang et al2has been criticised by homeopaths. While no review can ever be without limitations, these criticisms have been refuted. If needed, I can provide further written evidence onthis issue. 3. T heEvidence is Getting Weaker We published a further analysis testing whether the evidence for or against homeopathy is getting stronger. 4It compares the old5with the new edition6of one of our books. Both are based on systematic reviews employing virtually the same methodology .5, 6The indications included in our books are those which are common in primary care, frequently treated with CAM and for which clinical trials are available. Theliterature was searched up to March 2000 for the rst 5and up to May 2005 for the second edition.6To evaluate the data, we created a parameter which we called the \"weight of the evidence\". This was acompound variable consisting of the level of evidence (eg whether there was a single trial or a meta-analysis),the quality of the primary studies and the volume (ie total number of trials and their total sample size). 7The weight was graded in three categories: low, moderate and high. We graded the direction of the evidence inve categories: clearly positive, tentatively positive, uncertain, tentatively negative and clearly negative. InTable 3, we compared the weight and direction of the evidence of homeopathy for treating those conditionswhich were included in our book: AIDS, anxiety , asthma, cancer, chronic fatigue syndrome, bromyalgia,hay fever, headache, hypertension, labour induction, migraine, osteoarthritis, overweight, premenstrualsyndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, stroke, tinnitus and upper respiratory tract infection. Our comparisonsuggests that, as more clinical trials of homeopathy become available, the overall evidence gets not strongerbut weaker. For four conditions for which no trial evidence had been available in 2000, new evidence hademerged in 2005. In three cases, this was clearly negative, and in one it was rated as uncertain. Changes Technology Committee: Evidence either the weight or the direction of the evidence were observed in four of the 18 homeopathy-related indications (Table 3). By denition, the weight could only grow between 2000 and 2005. For one condition,namely chronic fatigue syndrome, the direction of evidence changed in a \"positive\" sense. For threeindications, the evidence had altered in the opposite sense: anxiety , asthma, rheumatoid arthritis. (Table 3) 4. O ther Evidence Homeopaths often argue that there are further systematic reviews which allegedly do show that homeopathy works. Examples are a recent Swiss Health Technology Assessment or the review by Mathie. 8 The problem is that these articles do not full the formal criteria for a systematic review, originate fromhomeopaths, are open to bias and can be criticised on important methodological grounds. 9 5. C onclusion Systematic reviews of rigorous trials of homeopathy fail to demonstrate that homeopathic remedies have eVects beyond those of placebo. Monitoring the development of the evidence over time we nd that the overall evidence-base of homeopathy is becoming more and more negative. Confronted with such data,homeopaths tend to counter that the method of testing homeopathy in clinical trials is flawed and thehierarchy of evidence is of disputed value. Nowadays they frequently cite Sir Michael Rawlins (NICE) insupport of this view who recently gave a lecture discussing that the evidence from randomised clinical trialsshould not be seen in isolation. Homeopaths fail to mention, however, that Sir Michael also made thefollowing statement about homeopathy: \"As far as homeopathy is concerned it breaks every rule in theevidential base! It is biologically implausible; it is almost always used to treat conditions where the naturalhistory is unpredictable; and the signal to noise ratio is 1 THE SYSTEMATIC REVIEW BY LINDE ET AL11AND ITS SUBSEQUENT RE-ANALYSES Assessment of Total patient methodological Reference Included trials (number) number quality Meta-analysis Overall conclusion* Comment Linde all double-blind and/or 2,588 yes of 89 trials which clinical e Vects of review was criticised for (1997) randomized placebo- could be submitted homeopathy are not 1) including di Verent remedies 11controlled trials of any to meta-analysis: completely due to 2) including di Verent conditions clinical condition OR %2.45;

BrHomeopath J 2001; PhD, FMedSci, FSB, FRCP , FRCPEd Complementary Medicine, Peninsula Medical School, Universities of Exeter & Plymouth Memorandum submitted by the NHS West Kent (HO 39) Evidence Check 2Homeopathy 1.Background to Homeopathy Commissioning Review 1.1 The West Kent PCT Board made a decision to withdraw routine NHS funding of homeopathy at its meeting on 27 September 2007. This decision was challenged via judicial review and subsequently rescindedwhile the PCT conducted a full Equality Impact Assessment (EIA), which took place between Decemberand June 2008. 1.2 The full EIA found that whilst homeopathy has no proven clinical e Vectiveness there may be an impact on a small cohort of patients with complex long-term conditions and/or life-limiting illness who nolonger nd relief in conventional medicines and who perceive benet from their experience of homeopathy . 1.3 The review included public consultation and was conducted between April and July 2007.1.4 The original public consultation process was challenged in the courts and found to be su Ycient. The consultation was not about whether homeopathy works but rather whether the NHS, in light of competingpriorities, should fund it. A Homeopathy Consultation Advisory Group (HCAG) consisting ofrepresentatives of the PCT, GPs/Practice Based Commissioners, West Kent Patient & Public InvolvementForum, Kent County Council's NHS Overview & Scrutiny Committee, Maidstone & Tunbridge Wells NHSTrust (Homeopathic Practitioners and Management), and the TWHH League of Friends was establishedto oversee the process. The PCT's Director of Civic Engagement chaired the group. 1.5 The HCAG agreed a series of options, which formed the basis of public consultation between 23 April and 2 July Ev 35 1.6 The consultation process included: \u2014 A systematic review of the high quality evidence base\u2014 Production of a consultation document and related questionnaire\u2014sent to a random sample of 1,000 of the PCT's registered patient population in addition to those who requested it directly orreceived a copy through their personal connection with homeopathy and/or the TWHH \u2014 A series of public meetings\u2014 An audit of all GPs in West Kent 2. E vidence Base 2.1 Clinical e Vectiveness 2.1.1 The PCT commissioned an independent review of studies meeting the criteria for evidence based medicine. The review found no clear evidence to support or oppose the commissioning of homeopathy . 2.1.2 The PEC concluded that there is limited evidence in favour of homeopathy; the PCTs resources should be directed towards treatments that have a greater evidence-base. 2.2 Population needs 2.2.1 PCT commissioning data indicates that in total 52% of all GP practices across West Kent refer patients to secondary homeopathic services. 2.2.2 The PCT conducted an audit of all GPs, which showed that in those practices that use homeopathy , less than 1% of the registered population are referred. 2.2.3 Almost all referrals for homeopathy are at the request of the patient rather than as a result of a clinical decision to refer. 2.2.4 There is no information available about the proportion of people with the conditions most commonly referred to homeopathy that use the service, or what the outcomes of their treatment is, to enablea clinical needs analysis. 2.2.5 The PEC's view was that in light of the many competing demands on PCT budgets and the range of treatments that cannot currently be routinely funded, homeopathy is not a priority for the generalpopulation of West Kent. 2.3 Value for money 2.3.1 The nancial value of homeopathy is small\u2014c. \u00a3200,000 per annum, however, since clinical eVectiveness is not proven it is not possible to conduct a cost e Vectiveness analysis. 2.3.2 In terms of cost-benet, results of the GP audit, TWHH's own audit and personal anecdote from service users suggest that homeopathy may provide help for some individuals and/or conditions whereconventional medicine is perceived to have failed or created unacceptable side e Vects. In some cases this is additionally reported to have resulted in a reduction in the use of conventional healthcare resources. 2.3.3 Levels of satisfaction amongst those who use the TWHH are high according to the hospital's own audit. 2.3.4 Data is not available to quantify relative health gain to individuals for each pound spent on homeopathy , nor is it possible to conclude whether greater health gain could be achieved for thoseindividuals by spending the same money on other services. 2.3.5 The PEC's view was that homeopathy is often an \"option of last resort\", which may mask the need to deal with di Ycult problems in a di Verent way , and that patients can be treated e Vectively through other mechanisms, for example pain management programmes. They are concerned about the high rate ofongoing/follow up visits, which may indicate some dependence on homeopathy . 2.3.6 The PEC also recognised, however, that homeopathy o Vered as part of a multi-faceted and primary care based approach for treating people with complex problems may add benet, if fully integrated withina multi-professional approach; this would not require a secondary care service. 2.4 Impact on other services 2.4.1 Results of the GP audit suggest that on average about half of people referred for homeopathy simultaneously access conventional treatment for the same condition. 2.4.2 About 40% of the GPs who had referred someone for homeopathy said that they would probably refer to other forms of treatment if homeopathy were Evidence 2.4.3 Some service users report a signicant reduction in their use of conventional services as a result of their experience of homeopathy , and this is backed up anecdotally by some GPs. 2.4.4 The PEC's conclusion was that whilst additional services may be required they might also be more eVective overall than homeopathy and support a wider group of patients than those who would use homeopathy . 2.4.5 The services that GPs suggest might be impacted if homeopathy were withdrawn are, for example, allergy specialists and dermatologists, GPs and psychological services, but this is not quantied. 2.5 Public demand 2.5.1 Less than 1% of the PCT population use homeopathy services, with the majority focused in Tunbridge Wells. Service use is not spread equally throughout West Kent. 2.5.2 Despite extensive national and local publicity about West Kent PCT's review of the commissioning of homeopathy services, only 22 letters and e-mails and 197 feedback forms were received during theconsultation period, and only 63 people in total attended one of ve public meetings. 2.5.3 Across the UK and in other parts of Europe, funding for homeopathy is being withdrawn in light of other priorities. 2.5.4 The PEC's view was that funding of homeopathy should be considered in context of all the priorities of the PCT and as such is not a priority . They believed that the fact of having a NHS funded HomeopathicService within PCT boundaries means homeopathy receives undue weight in the public's mind compared toother services and treatments that are under funded or cannot currently be provided on the NHS. 3. O ptions for Change 3.1 The consultation document identied three possible options for change, which were discussed and agreed with the HCAG, as follows: \u2014 Referrals to the Individual Exceptional Treatment Panel for decision\u2014 Fixed number of visits for homeopathy\u2014 Withdraw routine funding of homeopathy 3.2 As a result of the consultation a number of additional options were suggested. The HCAG considered all of them and nally added three further options: \u2014 Renegotiate the tari V \u2014 Introduce a homeopathy exclusions policy\u2014 \"Multi-faceted\" option (incorporating a number of other options) 4. M itigating Actions 4.1 Actions to mitigate the potential impact on existing service users were approved at the time of the Board decision. These included: \u2014 Establish an Individual Case Review Service for those people who wished to continue homeopathy treatment \u2014 Agree exceptionality criteria for use by the Individual Treatment Panel when deciding on requests for homeopathy treatment \u2014 Conduct a review of services available for people with complex multiple long-term conditions for whom conventional medicines may no longer be e Vective, including the provision of self-care support 4.2 In January 2009 the NHS West Kent Board received an update on the process of implementation of the agreed EIA mitigating factors and approved a set of decision making criteria in relation to exceptionalityfor use by the Individual Treatment Panel (ITP) from April 2009. 5. Individual Treatment Panel 5.1 From April 2009 new referrals for homeopathic treatment are required to go via the ITP . 5.2 Guidelines for exceptionality in the case of referral for homeopathy treatment were developed in conjunction with the Clinical Leadership Board and approved by the PCT Board in Ev 37 6. C onclusion 6.1 The weight of evidence collected as part of the initial review indicates that homeopathy services are not a clinical priority when compared with the many competing priorities of the PCT. 7. D eclaration of Interest 7.1 NHS West Kent operates a policy not to fund routine homeopathy treatment. Dr James Thallon Medical Director, NHS West Kent November 2009 Memorandum submitted by The British Homeopathic Association (HO 12) 1. B ackground 1.1 Homeopathic medicines are normally prescribed to patients by homeopathic practitioners and on an individualised basis, with importance placed on the unique character and lifestyle of the person concerned.Some randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of homeopathy have reflected this approach. Others haveinvestigated a given, standardised, homeopathic medicine taken by the entire sample of eligible patients, andwhere the input of a homeopathic practitioner may or may not have been involved. 1.2 This document is a summary and update of the overview submitted jointly by the British Homeopathic Association and the Faculty of Homeopathy in 2008 to the Government O Yce for Science. 3 It is a factual account of best clinical research evidence in homeopathy published in peer-reviewed scientic journals up to and including October 2009. It focuses primarily on systematic reviews of published RCTsand reconciles those data with results obtained in the original RCT literature. Findings from non-randomised clinical studies are presented in brief. We conclude with a number of recommendations forfuture research development in homeopathy . 2. S ystematic Reviews of Randomised Controlled Trials 2.1 Comprehensive systematic reviews (all medical conditions with homeopathy research) Four out of ve comprehensive systematic reviews of RCTs in homeopathy have reached the qualied conclusion that homeopathy di Vers from placebo. [1,2,3,4]One of those four reviews also stated there was \"insu Ycient evidence [...] to draw conclusions about the e Ycacy of homeopathy for any specic medical condition\".[4]The fth systematic review concluded there was \"weak evidence for a specic e Vect of homeopathic remedies\";[5]the methodology of that review and its conclusions have been challenged.[6]The value of any comprehensive systematic review, moreover, is limited by the small number of RCTs inhomeopathy , the di Vering criteria used by reviewers for data extraction, the disparate modes of homeopathy investigated, the narrow focus typically on placebo controlled trials, and by the heterogeneous range ofmedical conditions being examined collectively . 2.2 Systematic reviews focusing on particular medical conditions The issue of heterogeneity of medical condition has been avoided in each of 17 systematic reviews that have focused, to date, on homeopathy RCTs (individualised or standardised treatment) in one of16 particular clinical conditions. Five reviews concluded there was positive evidence for homeopathy(childhood diarrhoea; [7]post-operative ileus;[8]seasonal allergic rhinitis;[9,10]vertigo[11]); three concluded there or no evidence (attention-decit hyperactivity disorder;[12]delayed-onset muscle soreness;[13] headache and migraine prevention[14]); nine did not o Ver a clear conclusion either way (anxiety;[15]chronic asthma;[16]dementia;[17]depression;[18]headache and migraine treatment;[19]HIV/AIDS;[20]induction of labour;[21]influenza;[22]4osteoarthritis[23]). 2.3 Systematic reviews focusing on particular groups of diagnoses There are seven systematic reviews in this category . Four of these reviews were positive (allergies;[24]upper respiratory tract infections;[25,26]rheumatic diseases[27]); two were negative (ailments of childhood and adolescence;[28]cancer[29]); one was non-conclusive (cancer side-e Vects[30]). Homeopathic Arnica montana (often used in RCTs of post-operative pain or swelling) has itself been the subject of two systematic reviews:one was negative; [31]a more recent one was non-conclusive.[32] 3a Fisher P , Mathie RT. The research evidence base in homeopathy .

The authors concluded \"though promising, the data are not strong enough to make a general recommendation to useOscillococcinum for rst-line Evidence 3. R andomised Controlled Trials of Homeopathy :The Original Peer-Reviewed Research Literature 3.1 Criteria and methods for data extraction 3.1.1 We set clear criteria for including research papers in this overview. Non peer-reviewed research such as book chapters, conference proceedings and theses were excluded from consideration, as were papers inwhich the medicine tested had concentration greater than the homeopathic dilution 1X. This overviewtherefore contains references to all full papers of RCTs of homeopathy (any medical condition, treatmentor prevention) that have been published in explicitly peer-reviewed journals in any country and in anylanguage from 1950 to October 2009 inclusive. RCTs were categorised by whether: (a) they were controlledby placebo or by other than placebo (usual treatment or no treatment); and (b) the mode of homeopathictreatment was individualised or standardised. 3.1.2 A peer-reviewed trial was eligible for inclusion only if a minimum standard of intrinsic quality was met. A study was dened as an RCT if the paper unequivocally stated there had been prospective randomassignment to treatment. In the case of placebo-controlled trials, explicit mention of double blinding wasalso required; for other-than-placebo controlled (including equivalence) trials, observer blinding wassuYcient for inclusion. These and a number of additional criteria of quality were met by a total of 142 RCTs in 129 peer-reviewed journal papers. 3.1.3 Fewer than half the eligible RCTs included a power calculation and the associated pre-dened minimum e Vect that would be regarded as clinically important. In view of this low proportion of properly powered trials, positive or negative RCT ndings are described here in terms only of their statisticalsignicance, not their clinical importance. 5 3.1.4 A statistically conclusive trial result required that the 95% condence interval (CI) of the mean diVerence in the outcome variable did not include 0 (or P 0.05); a statistically non-signicant trial result meant that the 95% CI included 0 (or P (0.05). A study reporting statistically signicant ndings was either \"positive\" or \"negative\", depending on whether the homeopathy group was superior or inferior to controlin at least one principal outcome. Relevant corresponding criteria were applied to other-than-placebocontrolled trials. 3.1.5 To be regarded as statistically conclusive, we required at least one signicant nding out of no more than three statistical analyses of a given study's principal outcomes. Secondary outcomes were disregarded.This approach avoided the possibility of interpreting a trial as statistically conclusive based on merely onestatistically signicant positive or negative result out of many . 3.2 Randomised controlled trial ndings 3.2.1 Summary based on nature of control group: One hundred and twenty out of the total of 142 RCTs (85%) were placebo controlled. The other 22 RCTs (15%) were controlled by other than placebo. Of the142 trials overall, the summary nding was positive in 44%, negative in 8% and statistically non-conclusivein 48%. Findings in the other-than-placebo controlled RCTs were conclusively positive or negative morefrequently than those in placebo controlled RCTs: Summary trial nding: no. of RCTs (%) Statistically Control group Positive Negative non-conclusive Total Placebo 52 (43%) 3 (3%) 65 (54%) 120 Other than placebo 11 (50%) 8 (36%) 3 (14%) 22TOTAL 63 (44%) 11 (8%) 68 (48%) 142 3.2.2 Summary based on mode of homeopathy: Forty out of the total of 142 RCTs (28%) have reflected the normal individualised mode of homeopathic treatment. Each of the other 102 RCTs (72%) hasinvestigated a standardised homeopathic medicine. The percentage distribution of the summary ndingsdoes not di Ver between the two modes of treatment: Summary trial nding: no. of RCTs (%) Mode of Statistically homeopathy Positive Negative non-conclusive Total Individualised 18 (45%) 3 (8%) (8%) 68 (48%) 142 5This and further aspects of intrinsic trial quality in homeopathy are included in a new evaluation of the research literature that the British Homeopathic Association is 39 3.2.3 The above RCTs represent research in a total of 80 di Verent medical conditions. There is replicated research ( 2 peer-reviewed RCTs per medical condition) in each of 28 conditions (90 RCTs in total). There is a singleton RCT for each of the other 52 conditions. 3.2.4 Of the 28 conditions for which there is replicated research in RCTs, there are 13 that have not been the subject of formal systematic review to date. Viewed per condition, the balance of evidence from theseRCTs is positive for bromyalgia [33,34,35]and sinusitis,[36,37,38,39]and non-conclusive for insect survivors,[42,43]post-operative pain or swelling ( Arnica montana used in the majority of trials),[44,45,46,47,48,49,50]stroke,[51,52]and warts.[53,54]There was no identiable balance of ulcers,[58]otitis media[59,60]or post-operative analgesic intake.[61] Research 4.1 Controlled trials Non-randomised, controlled, parallel-group design has been applied to homeopathy . It has focused on homeopathy for either a particular medical condition (eczema;[62]insomnia;[63]otitis media;[64]vertigo[65])o r a specied range of complaints.[66,67,68]Results have been positive; in the absence of group randomisation, however, one cannot infer a clear causal relationship between the intervention and the clinical outcome inthis type of trial. [69] 4.2 Non-controlled studies Non-randomised, non-controlled, studies can make a useful contribution to developmental research in complementary medicine including homeopathy .[70,71]Findings from studies in this category may be considered as an adjunct to research evidence obtained from RCTs and from non-randomised controlledtrials; they do not in themselves constitute research evidence. Findings have been strongly positive, includingthose for dysmenorrhoea, [72]headache,[73]menopausal flushes[74]and sinusitis.[75]A cross-sectional survey undertaken collectively by the ve NHS homeopathic hospitals reported improved patient-reportedoutcome whose extent and timing varied between the di Verent principal medical complaints (eczema, chronic fatigue syndrome, menopausal symptoms and osteoarthritis). [76]This paper emphasised homeopathy's contribution to the healthcare of patients with multiple, complex, morbidities. 5.summary of Clinical Research in Homeopathy to Date 5.1 Most comprehensive systematic reviews of RCTs in homeopathy (individualised or standardised treatment) have concluded there is evidence that the homeopathic intervention di Vers from placebo treatment. 5.2 Condition-specic systematic reviews have indicated e Vectiveness of homeopathy (individualised or standardised treatment) in childhood attention-decit hyperactivity disorder, delayed-onset muscle soreness, and in prevention of headache and migraine. Findings are non-conclusive for all other conditions that havebeen the subject of review. 5.3 Homeopathy research has focused on a total of 80 di Verent medical conditions, in which there is a total of 142 peer-reviewed RCTs that met a number of key quality criteria for this overview. Findings in 44%of those RCTs were positive, 8% were negative and 48% were non-conclusive. The majority of trials haveexamined standardised homeopathy and used placebo-controlled design. There has been replicated RCTresearch in each of only 28 medical conditions; of those without formal systematic review to date, there isa balance of positive RCT evidence for bromyalgia and sinusitis. 6. R ecommendations 6.1 New and independently conducted RCTs are essential to conrm or refute the currently available research evidence in homeopathy for specic conditions. There is a need to enhance the quantity and thequality of research on the e Vectiveness of individualised homeopathy , particularly in chronic conditions, as well as on e Ycacy of specic homeopathic medicines compared with placebo. Future trials must be statistically powered to ensure conclusions may be made about clinically relevant e Vects. 6.2 Greater collaboration between homeopathic practitioners, conventional physicians and basic scientists would enhance the scope and quality of homeopathy research. Integration of homeopathicresearch in existing academic and clinical settings (by practitioners of homeopathy working within the NHS,where regulated and safe clinical practice is assured) raises standards of research in homeopathy ,encouraging mutual understanding and promoting agreement on the interpretation of ndings. An exampleof this approach recently has been the e Vective collaboration between the Universities of Leeds and She Yeld with Barnsley Hospital NHS Foundation Technology Committee: Evidence 6.3 In focusing research on areas in homeopathy where positive ndings from RCTs might be corroborated, the most promising targets include those with already replicated ndings, such asbromyalgia, seasonal allergic rhinitis, sinusitis, and vertigo. Attention must also be paid to areas wherethere is mainly non-conclusive or negative trial evidence to date. 6.4 Moreover, emphasis should be placed on those clinical areas where RCT evidence is currently scanty but where homeopathy is frequently used in NHS practice, [76,77]particularly in diagnoses that are di Ycult to treat using conventional medicine and that have promising data from non-randomised studies. In thisrespect, especially worthwhile research targets include atopic eczema, chronic fatigue, depression, irritablebowel syndrome, menopausal symptoms, otitis media and premenstrual syndrome. Patients with complexmedical predicaments are not normally eligible for RCT research but should be included in suitable clinicaloutcome studies, most notably in the clinical context of the homeopathic hospitals. 6.5 The above recommendations for research development are consistent with comments made about homeopathy in the GO-Science Review of the Department of Health: \"A programme for a stronger evidence base would necessitate agreement between practitioners, patients and researchers on what should be evaluated, and on relevant endpoints.

Robert T Mathie PhD Research Development Adviser November 2009 Witnesses: Professor Edzard Ernst, Director, Complementary Medicine Group, Peninsula Medical School, Dr Peter Fisher, Director of Research, Royal London Homeopathic Hospital, Dr Robert Mathie, Research Development Adviser, British Homeopathic Association, and Dr James Thallon, Medical Director, NHS West Kent, gave evidence. Chairman: We now welcome our second panel this morning: Professor Edzard Ernst, the Director ofComplementary Medicine Group at PeninsulaMedical School\u2014welcome; Dr Peter Fisher, theDirector of Research at the Royal LondonHomeopathic Hospital\u2014welcome to you; DrRobert Mathie, the Research Development Adviserat the British Homeopathic Association and Dr James Thallon, the Medical Director at the NHSWest Kent. Thank you all very , very much indeed for coming. I am going to ask Graham Stringer to beginthis set of questions. Q112 Mr Stringer: Can I start with the central question of the last panel: is there any evidence thathomeopathy shows any e Ycacy beyond the Technology Committee: Evidence 25 November 2009 Professor Edzard Ernst, Dr Peter Fisher, Dr Robert Mathie and Dr James Thallon Professor Ernst: I would echo what has been said and warn people to pick cherries out of a biggercake; if you look at the bigger cake the bottom line isthere is no good evidence that homeopathic remediesare better than placebos. Dr Fisher: I diametrically disagree and am shocked, actually , by the statements that have repeatedly beenmade this morning that there is no evidence. Youhave, in fact, a submission before you that actuallyenumerates the meta-analyses and systematic reviews. It is actually due to my colleague, RobertMathie, but to summarise: there have been ve,comprehensive, global systematic reviews or meta-analyses of homeopathy which look at the wholething, of which four were positive. If you look at thecondition based systematic reviews and meta-analyses there are 24, of which nine are positive, venegative and ten inconclusive for various reasons,including the trials were not large enough or theywere heterogeneous\u2014the trials were somewhatdiVerent and they could not really be compared. I say it is quite clear if you actually look at theevidence, and they are enumerated in a documentyou have before you. Dr Mathie: I think it is important to ensure that when one looks at systematic reviews one also looksat individual medical conditions, for whichhomeopathy may or may not be e Vective. In terms of the placebo e Vect, there is evidence from three systematic reviews and meta-analyses ofhomeopathy showing a specic homeopathicmedicine is e Ycacious compared with a placebo. Seasonal allergic rhinitis and vertigo would be twoparticular examples that I could mention in moredetail, if you wish. Dr Thallon: I will give my view from an NHS commissioning perspective, as that is theorganisation I represent, and we found quite clearlythat, in terms of competing priorities, evidence infavour of homeopathy is so weak as to not make ita priority within the context of the other prioritiesfacing the NHS. Q113 Mr Stringer: That is an interesting point. Should the NHS spending on any treatments bebased on evidence of e Ycacy or e Vectiveness? Dr Thallon: Absolutely; I think it should be an organising principle of our provision of healthcare. Q114 Mr Stringer: I am sorry , I perhaps was not as clear about that. What is your understanding of thediVerence between e Ycacy and e Vectiveness? Dr Thallon: I do not know if I have one, really . What I would stick to is that we would expect thattreatments which we commission to have been testedinsofar as it is possible\u2014insofar as there is evidenceof eVectiveness (I certainly understand what that is)\u2014I would expect them to have passed that by awide margin and, also, for there to have been ademonstrable need for that treatment in order for itto be commissioned.Dr Mathie: Can I answer the question about e Ycacy compared with e Vectiveness? Q115 Mr Stringer: Yes. Dr Mathie: It is indeed a fundamental point. E Ycacy is judged in placebo controlled trials of a veryspecic medicine or intervention. So it is veryspecic, usually in terms of pharmacologicalinvestigation; it is a very specic drug and a veryspecic dose; it is a very specic schedule treating avery specic type of patient, who may be limited bygender, age and so on. So e Ycacy is almost a laboratory experiment, if you like; it is testing theway in which a drug, in principle, could have aneVect. E Vectiveness is something that usually non- placebo controlled trials are designed to do, usuallyagainst usual care, or sometimes no treatment\u2014forexample, waiting list controls\u2014in which the realworld e Vect of a system of care is judged against what is usual up to that point\u2014a new interventionthat is compared in the real world against usual care. Q116 Mr Stringer: Just on the rst part of the question, do you believe that NHS spending shouldbe based on e Ycacy or e Vectiveness? Dr Mathie: Both. Dr Fisher: In simple terms the distinction is between ideal conditions and real world conditions\u2014e Ycacy being ideal conditions and e Vectiveness being real world conditions. Yes, they should be based ondecisions particularly about real world e Vectiveness, because in the real world issues like long-term use,the co-morbidity of people who have got multipleillnesses, side-e Vects, and so on, are much more prominent than they are in the short term, veryrigorous e Ycacy studies. You may think the distinction is academic but actually I can quote younumerous examples where looking at the twodiVerent types of evidence leads to di Verent conclusions; treatments which appear to beeYcacious in small-scale but rigorous trials may not actually be e Vective in the real world because of adverse e Vects or whatever. Professor Ernst: I would agree that good decisions are based on both. E Ycacy tests whether treatment works under ideal conditions; for instance, ahypertensive agent may well be e Vective under ideal conditions and then will not work in the real worldbecause people experience side-e Vects, etc, etc. Good decisions need to be both based on e Ycacy and e Vectiveness. I would add, however, that without e Ycacy e Vectiveness can be quite meaningless, and there are trials that are designed insuch a way that, for instance, could test standardcare plus homeopathy versus standard care alone. Ifyou understand what homeopathy entails, theempathetic encounter of one hour of empathy andunderstanding towards the patient, it is predictablethat such a trial will generate a positive result simplybecause of its non-specic e Vect\u2014its placebo eVects\u2014and therefore because it is predictable (and we have shown that this is predictable) such a trialshould not be done because you know the resultbefore the trial, and arguably such a trial Evidence Ev 45 25 November 2009 Professor Edzard Ernst, Dr Peter Fisher, Dr Robert Mathie and Dr James Thallon Q117 Mr Boswell: Can I come in on this, and I think it is primarily for Dr Fisher. I wonder if you wouldlike to comment on the tolerance of homeopathicremedies over a relatively long period ofadministration. I think it is sort of implicit in thedistinction you were drawing between the necessarymetrics for e Yciency and e Vectiveness. Clearly , if there are problems with long-term medication of,say , hypertension, as Professor Ernst has mentioned,it might be helpful to the Committee to knowwhether that is a factor which, at least, would colourthe advice which pharmacists would be giving topeople.Dr Fisher: Sure. It is normally assumed that homeopathy is completely safe\u2014at least direct, interms of the distinction between direct safeness andindirect safeness. Q118 Mr Boswell: There is no direct harm derived from taking\u2014Dr Fisher: Actually , that is not quite true. We did survey the literature, we asked the MHRA, we askedthe USFDA, we asked the companies and, actually ,if you look at placebo-controlled trials ofhomeopathy you do nd a slightly increasedincidence of adverse e Vects in the active arm compared to the placebo arm, but there is noevidence of serious or life-threatening adverseeVects. There is evidence that active homeopathy can cause certain problems, and that comes from asystematic review of the world literature. Q119 Mr Stringer: Can you be more specic about that?Dr Fisher: There are a number of reports. For instance, there was a trial done in Italy onhomeopathic medicine for prevention of flu wherequite a lot of people who actually got thehomeopathic medicine got flu-like symptoms butdid not actually get flu. That was more frequent inthe group that got the active homeopathy than theones who got the placebo. It was quite a largestudy\u2014800 patients studied\u2014and that is the largest,single report of adverse e Vects with homeopathy . Again, the MHRA has a number of yellow cards; theFDA has reports of adverse e Vects\u2014generally mild and transient\u2014but there do appear to be some.Professor Ernst: I think what Peter just referred to, at least partly he referred to, is called \"homeopathicaggravation\"; homeopaths believe that if they ndthe ideal optimal remedy then there will be or can bean aggravation in about 20 per cent of patients thatis expected. Peter also knows, because he has in hisjournal published our systematic review of testingwith these aggravations, we looked at all the clinicaltrials and counted such events and we found nostatistically signicant di Verence between the aggravations reported in the placebo arms ascompared to the homeopathic treated arms. So thestory of homeopathic aggravations may well be amyth. Q120 Mr Stringer: Thank you. Dr Thallon, is it ethical for the NHS to prescribe placebos? Shouldthe NHS prescribe placebos?Dr Thallon: I struggle with the notion that it is ethical to prescribe placebos. I am not saying that itdoes not happen; I think that a number of the waysin which people behave or prescribe could bedescribed as prescribing placebos but, in principle, ifyou prescribe a drug which you know to have noclinical e Ycacy on a basis which is essentially dishonest with a patient, I personally feel that that isunethical behaviour. Q121 Mr Stringer: Is the natural conclusion from that that the NHS should not spend money on aplacebo?Dr Thallon: I would very much think that is a logical conclusion. To me, this is all about following theevidence to its logical conclusion. Q122 Mr Stringer: Does anybody else want to comment?Dr Mathie: Can I clarify , I think, the key point that has not yet been raised this morning, and that is thatthere are signicant numbers of homeopathicmedicines that are not diluted to the point where themolecular content is uncertain. Q123 Mr Stringer: I am sorry , can you say that again?Dr Mathie: There are a substantial number of homeopathic medicines where there is molecularcontent. There seems to be an assumption that theyare, to quote from an earlier commentator, \"justsugar pills\"; in fact, many are not just sugar pills andmany of those have been investigated in randomisedcontrolled trials, and some of those have shownclinical e Vectiveness beyond placebo, and some of those, in turn, have shown clinically relevant andmeaningful e Vects of homeopathic medicines compared with placebo. So there are trials out therewhich are of good quality and of good design, withgood sample sizes where positive evidence isavailable, and it is not cherry picking. Q124 Chairman: Would you give us one example and get Dr Thallon to say whether it is NHS prescribed?Dr Mathie: V ertigo. There is a product made in Germany\u2014regrettably it is not available for use inthe UK\u2014called V ertigoheel and there is systematicreview of the original randomised controlled trialsshowing that that product is e Ycacious beyond a placebo e Vect. Q125 Mr Stringer: Professor Ernst? Professor Ernst: I had my hand up to answer your question on whether the NHS should prescribeplacebo or allow placebos. First, about V ertigoheel,this is not even a homeopathic product; this ishomotoxicological, which strictly speaking is nothomeopathic. This may be too technical. I wouldargue\u2014Mr Stringer: It sounds very interesting, actually . Chairman: We can cope with technical data; we are okay with that. We are called Technology Committee: Evidence 25 November 2009 Professor Edzard Ernst, Dr Peter Fisher, Dr Robert Mathie and Dr James Thallon Q126 Dr Harris: Do not raise expectations! Professor Ernst: If one denes homeopathy as curing like with like, the homotoxicologicaltreatments are not homeopathic\u2014that is the point Iwas trying to make. Back to the placebo question. Iwould argue it is unnecessary , unreliable andunethical to prescribe placebos through the NHS;unnecessary because if you do it well then an activetreatment will also generate a placebo e Vect. If I give my patient an aspirin for his or her headache and Ido it with empathy , time and understanding thispatient will benet from the pharmacological e Vect of the aspirin and she will also benet from theplacebo e Vect through the encounter with her clinician. It is unreliable and there is lots of data toshow that placebo e Vects are notoriously unreliable; somebody who responds today may not respondtomorrow; responses are not large in e Vect size and they are not usually long-lasting. Foremost, it isunethical. That is my third point. Q127 Mr Stringer: You get to the same conclusion as Dr Thallon that, therefore, the NHS should notspend money on placebos? Professor Ernst: Correct, yes. Dr Fisher: If I could just comment, rstly , on V ertigoheel; it is actually registered as ahomeopathic product in Germany and preparedaccording to the HAB, the HomeopathischeArzneibuch, which is the German HomeopathicPharmacopoeia. To come back to the other questionof placebo e Vects, I believe I am the only person called today who actually practises homeopathy . Iam a rather atypical homeopath in the sense that Iam a doctor; I am also an accreditedrheumatologist\u2014I could prescribe all those nastytoxic drugs that my friends and colleagues prescribeand freely acknowledge are less safe than they mightwish. I practise homeopathy because I think itworks, and I believe the evidence supports me inthat. I would not practise it for two minutes if Ithought I was conning the patients. We just need tobe clear about placebo e Vects, because sometimes a lot of concepts get muddled up. There are non-specic e Vects, sometimes also called context e Vects, and that means that every good doctor should talkto their patient, explain to their patient, give theirpatient good advice on diet and lifestyle and do allof that before even thinking of reaching for theprescription pad. However, having done that\u2014and Ihave absolutely no shame about maximising mynon-specic e Vects (I think every good doctor should do it)\u2014I would not use homeopathy for twominutes if I thought it was only a placebo. I think thestrongest evidence that it is not a placebo comesfrom an area that has not even been mentioned this morning, which is basic science. There is now aburgeoning area of basic science\u2014there are modelswhich you can do in a test tube\u2014which show e Vects with high dilutions which have been replicated bymultiple laboratories, multi-centre groups. I believethere are seven such models now, by the last count;the best known one is inhibition of basophildegranulation by high dilutions of histamine(basophils is a model of the immune response); thereis another one concerning aspirin and blood-clotting and another one concerning metamorphoses oftadpoles to frogs. These have been replicated byindependent groups or multi-centre groups. The frogone was done originally in Austria and recentlyrepeated in Brazil. Q128 Mr Stringer: Just a nal question to the whole panel. Should money that is spent on homeopathicconsultations be redirected to elsewhere in the NHS?Dr Thallon: We very much take that view. We would not swap it from one treatment directly to another,but clearly if the business of PCTs is aboutprioritisation then the treatment which the balanceof scientic opinion says is of either virtually noeYcacy or e Vectiveness or none we would prioritise at a far lower level than other treatments we wish tocommission.Dr Mathie: For me it begs the question that there is a need for cost-e Vectiveness evaluation of homeopathy . There is almost none, at this stage, andthe whole question about the cost and the impact ofhomeopathic consultation could be tested inappropriate studies. The other problem, I think, isthat where does the patient go if he or she does notgo to the homeopathic practitioner? I am talkingabout in, typically , a medical practitioner ofhomeopathy . They will go elsewhere in the NHS andthey may not get the rounded approach to treatmentof the person which is what homeopathy ischaracterised by . So this is not a straightforwardpoint. Q129 Mr Stringer: Dr Fisher? Dr question\u2014I am sorry? Q130 Mr Stringer: The question was should the money that is spent on homeopathic consultationsbe redirected within the NHS?Dr Fisher: I think the evidence, such as it is (for instance there is good evidence from France andGermany) is that you get more bang for your buckswith homeopathy . If you integrate homeopathy youget better outcomes and it does not cost any more.So I do not think it should be redirected; you getmore bang for your bucks. Q131 Mr Stringer: Professor Ernst? Professor Ernst: If the NHS's commitment to evidence-based medicine is more than lip servicethen, surely , money has to be spent for treatmentsthat are evidence-based, and homeopathy is not. Q132 Dr Harris: Dr Fisher, you mentioned that there were some adverse e Vects found in homeopathic treatments. How many homeopathictreatments over the 200 years that it has been inexistence have been withdrawn from the market dueto safety fears because of these adverse e Vects, as one sees in conventional medicine?Dr Fisher: Not many but some have been. The most recent one was something called Malaria-o Ycinalis which was most regrettably (and I opposed Evidence Ev 47 25 November 2009 Professor Edzard Ernst, Dr Peter Fisher, Dr Robert Mathie and Dr James Thallon Q133 Dr Harris: It had side-e Vects, did it? Dr Fisher: No, it was withdrawn because of safety concerns. Q134 Dr Harris: On the basis of adverse e Vects? Dr Fisher: No, nothing has been withdrawn. Q135 Dr Harris: That is interesting. When Graham Stringer was asking the questions he started withyou, Professor Ernst, so you did not get a chance torespond to the assertion made by the witnesses onyour left that systematic reviews overwhelminglyshowed e Vectiveness of homeopathy .\u2014ve out of six, I think, was the expression used.Dr Fisher: Four out of ve. Dr Mathie: I do not think we used the word \"overwhelming\". Q136 Dr Harris: Four out of ve seems to be a majority . Would you comment on that? Have thereonly been ve systematic reviews and do they showthat positive result, in your opinion?Professor Ernst: I have supplied you with a list of systematic reviews as published a few years ago, andin that list there are already , I think, almost twodozen. Q137 Dr Harris: Two dozen? Professor Ernst: None in that list, which was after a very prominent systematic review and meta-analysisby Klaus Linde was published in The Lancet , including the ones we analyse in The Lancet data including Linde re-analysing his own data, none ofthese systematic reviews were positive. Q138 Dr Harris: Why do you think that homeopaths say that systematic reviews are positive if it seems toyou that they are not positive? Both sides cannotbe right.Professor Ernst: I know of some reviews which are not systematic. I know of a Swiss health technologyassessment which is not what I understand by asystematic review because it includes everythingsuch as case series observational studies, non-controlled studies, non-randomised studies, and soforth. When you do that indeed the majority ofpublications is positive, but in a systematic review,typically , you dene your entry criteria and weusually as randomised clinical trials\u2014ifpossible, randomised placebo controlled clinicaltrials and in homeopathy that is possible\u2014and thevast majority of these systematic reviews do notconrm that homeopathic remedies are more thanplacebos. Q139 Dr Harris: Dr Mathie, do you accept that the overwhelming view of independent researchers, whodo not make money from conventional medicinescompeting with you or make money from practice orselling or manufacturing of homeopathicmedicine\u2014do you accept, even though you maydisagree with them, that the overwhelming majorityof people who have looked at this from anindependent perspective say that the evidence base is poor for e Ycacy of homeopathy when looking at good quality systematic reviews?Dr Mathie: Given that most people in that category probably have not investigated the researchliterature in su Ycient depth to really form a well- judged opinion, my answer would be yes. Q140 Dr Harris: Because they are ignorant, essentially? I do not mean that in a pejorative way;they just have not done the job well enough\u2014allthese people like Professor Ernst, who is a Professorin this eld. They are just inadequate in theirresearch?Dr Mathie: Not at all. What I would say is that there are those with whom I have endeavoured tocollaborate and do have collaborations with who aremainstream academic researchers\u2014for example, inatopic eczema at the University of Nottingham\u2014who are seriously engaged by the idea of conductingrandomised controlled trials in homeopathy becauseatopic eczema is not well treated conventionally andthey see an e Vectiveness gap there, and it is worth trying and worth testing in an objective, open-minded fashion. There are many people in thecountry who are prepared to engage in homeopathicresearch and it is those types of people that I am veryeager to collaborate with. Q141 Dr Harris: However, systematic reviews take a lot of time; you have to look through thousands ofpapers\u2014Dr Mathie: Of course they do. Q142 Dr Harris: You have to check them and the entry criteria. You have to be quite dedicated to dothese systematic reviews and to review systematicreviews. The majority of those people, without anaxe to grind, say that they do not show an e Vect. Does that worry you?Dr Mathie: It does. However, reviews are designed to distil the literature out into a single paper or two,compared with maybe a dozen randomisedcontrolled trials. Can I just address the questionabout the discrepancy of opinion regarding theresults of systematic reviews. May I just quote arecent paper by Dr Klaus Linde himself in a paperpublished just a few months ago. He says: \"Withsmall and heterogeneous datasets, the most likelysituation in complementary and alternativemedicine\u2014these decisions [about the validity oftrials and which trials are contained withinsystematic reviews] can lead to quite di Verent ndings. A powerful example of how di Verent approaches, summarising the available evidence,can lead to very di Verent conclusions are the two large meta-analyses on homeopathy published inThe Lancet 1997 and 2005\"\u2014and we know which ones he is talking about there\u2014\"although the basicdatasets [themselves] yielded similar ndings\"; it isthe interpretation that di Vers depending on one's perspective. Q143 Dr Harris: Feel free to send that into us. That is probably the easiest Technology Committee: Evidence 25 November 2009 Professor Edzard Ernst, Dr Peter Fisher, Dr Robert Mathie and Dr James Thallon Dr Mathie: I can hand it to you if you would like. Q144 Dr Harris: I just want to deal with this ideal world/real world thing. If you cannot nd an e Vect, if you cannot demonstrate e Ycacy in an ideal world where everything is set up to identify that e Vect, it is hard to see that an e Vect you see in the real world\u2014 dirty clinical practice if you like\u2014is based on thecited e Ycacy . It might be due to confounding factors. Dr Mathie: I understand your question. Q145 Dr Harris: It is not the other way round, is it? Dr Mathie: However, it is based on a false premise, if I may say so, because in fact there is e Ycacy research there. There are published e Ycacy studies. There are something like 37 of them, if I remember o Vhand, where there is positive evidence. There are another50 in which there is inconclusive or perhaps negativeevidence. What I would make a plea for is that theeYcacy studies that do exist\u2014and I could name them all and I can send the details to you becausethey exist out there\u2014should transform graduallyover time with active research into e Vectiveness research where those homeopathic medicines thatare shown to be e Vective are used within the armamentarium of the homeopathic processbecause, after all, what has not become fully clearthis morning is that homeopathy is a system of care.There are 3,000 homeopathic medicines in thepharmacopoeia. We need to understand the e Ycacy of each, ideally , but let us do it gradually with thosespecic medicines where they are frequently usedand have been researched in e Ycacy research and can become gradually evidence-based contributionsto homeopathy as a system of care. Q146 Dr Harris: Dr Thallon, you have sent in evidence setting out how you did your review, and Ido not think it is worth you repeating that because itis in the written evidence which will be published ifwe do a report on this, as I suspect we will. Why doyou think it is right that what you did should haveto be replicated many times in every commissioningorganisation or is there something in the water, ornot in the water in West Kent, that makes yourndings di Verent from something that might be done in Manchester? Dr Thallon: We are in a particular circumstance because there is a homeopathic hospital within ourgeographical locality and that is why we had to go tothe lengths we did in order to prove the case, becauseother commissioning organisations who spend a bitof money on homeopathy did not have the facilitywithin their borders that meant that the resistance tothe commissioning decision was likely to be asintense as it was for us. I think our process in termsof its quality and the way that it is done with scrutinyis a good roadmap for other organisations to adopt,and we would be very happy to act as a guide toother commissioning organisations that wish tofollow this path. Personally , I feel that if e Vectiveness in clinical treatment and evidence-based medicine isgoing to be an organising principle of the NHS, then to do this in every locality would be a diversion ofotherwise scarce resources, and if it were possible tolearn from our experience then we would be veryhappy to give that learning out. Q147 Dr Harris: Have you considered either circulating it yourself, would you have objections toother people circulating it, or do you think it wouldsave time and money if the Department of Healthcirculated your work?Dr Thallon: I certainly do not think the issue of the decommissioning of non-evidence based practiceshould be beneath the Department of Health to helpcommissioning organisations with. Yes, I wouldhave thought there could well be a role for theDepartment of Health in helping otherorganisations get to the point we have got to shouldthey choose to do so. Q148 Dr Harris: The Department of Health has not issued any guidance and has not asked NICE to lookat this. That may be a reluctance by the Departmentof Health to give any advice or instructions orguidelines or policies to commissioners, but myexperience locally is that commissioners areoverwhelmed with guidance and advice andexecutive letters and circulars from the Departmentof Health.Dr Thallon: Not overwhelmed but there is plenty of it. Q149 Dr Harris: As an individual doctor who has the views you have, having looking at it, why do youthink the Department of Health and ministers arenot dealing with this?Dr Thallon: I think this would have to be a personal rather than an organisational view. Q150 Dr Harris: Of course. Dr Thallon: I think the politics of homeopathy and what homeopathy is are di Ycult because homeopathy , to an extent, appears to my mind to gobeyond the debate purely about the science, becauseI feel that we have taken a view about where thebalance of the scientic community's opinion is onhomeopathy and to me and my colleagues it is prettyclear. Clearly there is something that perpetuates thenotion that homeopathy is important which goesbeyond purely the scientic debate because to mymind\u2014and it can never be settled because you neverknow what might happen\u2014the balance of thecurrent research at the moment suggests to us,essentially scientically trained but lay people, thatthe issue of the e Vectiveness of homeopathy is not in question. Q151 Dr Harris: My last question is to Dr Fisher. In your written submission to us, which I read, and inyour answer, you talked about the basic science thatshows a basis for the function of how homeopathymight work. I think it is fair to say that some of it isradical stu V. Why do you think that there Evidence Ev 49 25 November 2009 Professor Edzard Ernst, Dr Peter Fisher, Dr Robert Mathie and Dr James Thallon no Nobel Prize given to the people who have made these astonishing discoveries of the potential for thememory of water and a physiological impact of somehomeopathy remedies where the dilution is such thatit is accepted that there is unlikely to be a singlemolecule left? Dr Fisher: It may yet happen. I think we are at a very early stage. The research has burgeoned in the lastfew years and it needs more work. We are talkingabout a sociological phenomenon within the scientic community and of course new ideas oftenencounter strong resistance. I think that is what isgoing on. People say loosely that it challenges thebasic laws of physics; it does not. It may yet happen. Q152 Dr Harris: On that basis then why is it that when you have a solution of water that used to havesome homeopathic substance in it but it has beendiluted that the water is said to retain that memorybut does not remember all the poo, you could call it,that has been in it, because all water has bits of oureZuent. Dr Fisher: I am surprised you did not mention Oliver Cromwell's bladder. In this context it is traditionalto mention Oliver Cromwell's bladder becauseapparently somebody once calculated that in eachglass of water you drink it is statistically probablethat one of those molecules once passed throughOliver Cromwell's bladder. Q153 Dr Harris: The point I am making is that you have a higher chance of having that molecule butyou do not believe the molecule is necessary , so whyis it that the specic e Vect is from the homeopathic element that has been in it and not someone'sammonia that has been in it? Dr Fisher: It is quite straightforward. The point is that we use highly puried water and highly puriedethanol there. There is no such thing as absolutelypure water but this is highly puried, it is double-distilled and deionised. Q154 Dr Harris: It has not even got sugar in it? Dr Fisher: At that stage no, so the impurities are a concentration of parts per million or parts perbillion. You then add something at a concentrationof parts one in ten or one in 100 and shake it. . Q155 Dr Harris: The shaking is important? Dr Fisher: The shaking is important. Q156 Dr Harris: I would have thought it would have less memory if you shook it. I can understand if youleft it alone it might form a memory . Dr Fisher: This has been looked at and the answer is that it does not induce the same structural e Vects. You are inducing structural e Vects which may involve silica and which may involve dissolvedoxygen molecules\u2014it is not quite certain\u2014but youcan show that this water is di Verent from water that is just shaken without the stu Vbeing in it.Q157 Dr Harris: How much do you have to shake it? Dr Fisher: That has not been fully investigated. Q158 Dr Harris: A random amount of shaking? Dr Fisher: You have to shake it vigorously but exactly how much you have to shake it, no. If youjust gently stir it, it does not work. Q159 Dr Harris: Does the MHRA check how much it has been shaken before it approves it fortreatment? Dr Fisher: You would have to ask the MHRA, I do not know. Q160 Chairman: Dr Harris, I am going to leave the shaking at that point. Professor Ernst, you justwanted to have a last word on that. Professor Ernst: Just a quick comment. Even if the water is di Verent it leaves totally unanswered the question of how it exerts any health e Vects in human bodies. The water in my kitchen sink is also di Verent from distilled water yet it is unhealthy and nothealthy . Chairman: Okay , we will ponder on that. Dr Iddon? Q161 Dr Iddon: This year the Department of Health announced that it was going to run some pilotstudies on personal health budgets allowing peopleto spend public money , to a degree, on whatever theydesire to spend it on, including homeopathy . Bearingin mind that the National Health Service is alwaysshort of money\u2014this has already been referred to\u2014is it right, do you think, gentlemen, that peopleshould be able to take money away from perhapsmore deserving areas in the NHS and spend it onhomeopathy if that is what the patient desires? Professor Ernst: This is presumably from the ill- conceived notion that patient choice has todominate in health care. I am an ex-clinician and Iknow about the importance of patient choice, butpatient choice that is not guided by evidence is notchoice but arbitrariness, and therefore I am not infavour of it. Dr Fisher: I strongly support patient choice and clearly where patients do get the opportunity tochoose they very often do choose homeopathy andother forms of complementary medicine. Q162 Dr Iddon: And it is right that that should be with public money rather than their own money? Dr Fisher: Yes, I think so. There needs to be a balance but, yes, successive Governments have beencommitted to patient choice and rightly so, in myview. Dr Mathie: The British Homeopathic Association strongly supports patient choice for treatments thatare evidence-based and would propose thedevelopment of much greater research in order tosecure that evidence base. Dr Thallon: Personally I support the issue that clinical e Vectiveness should be an organising principle of the NHS. It Technology Committee: Evidence 25 November 2009 Professor Edzard Ernst, Dr Peter Fisher, Dr Robert Mathie and Dr James Thallon health budgets may cause some ine Ycient use of NHS resources, however, there are limits and theNHS is not purely governed by clinical e Vectiveness. There are issues of patient consent and it is publicmoney at the end of the day . It may well be right forpeople to have an element of choice in what theyspend their money upon. However, I think there areissues around whether or not they should be able tochoose a treatment which is clearly lacking inevidence. What would happen once that treatmenthad been used, found to be ine Vective and they were forced to return to the NHS; what would the attitudeof the NHS be at that point? Q163 Dr Iddon: I think I can only put this question to these three gentlemen and it is this: if a patientcame to you for homeopathic treatment and you feltthat you might put that patient at risk by treatingthem in such a way , would homeopaths have thecourage to refer them to a traditional clinicianbecause with a homeopath the patient might be atrisk with the homeopathic treatment as against thetraditional treatment?Professor Ernst: I nd it to generalise across homeopaths. There are good homeopaths, inthe sense that they are responsible and try their bestto look after patients, and there are homeopathswho are less well equipped to do that and indeed lesswell-trained, and I would argue that doctorhomeopaths, by and large, are better equipped to dothat. There are too many di Verent types of homeopaths for me to be able to answer thatquestion. Q164 Dr Iddon: I know it is di Ycult to generalise, I accept that point but do you think homeopaths areadequately qualied to recognise by a clinicaldiagnosis a serious medical condition?Professor Ernst: Doctor homeopaths should be because they have studied medicine. Anybody whohas not studied medicine is unlikely to be well-equipped for all di Ycult situations. Dr Fisher: I can only speak on behalf of the Faculty of Homeopathy which is a statutory body whichonly admits members of registered healthprofessions, so that includes doctors but alsoveterinarians, dentists, pharmacists and so on, andfor them the answer to your questions is absolutelyyes; they are equipped to make a diagnosis andindeed to recognise the domain of professionalcompetence. It is normal for a pharmacist, forinstance, to give advice over the counter in the shopand also to say , \"You need to go to see a doctorabout that.\" Of course the answer is yes, they areequipped and they would refer on when required.Dr Mathie: Unequivocally yes. Q165 Dr Harris: One quick question to Dr Mathie. You are an adviser to the British HomeopathicAssociation. You do not register homeopaths?Dr Mathie: No, the Faculty of Homeopathy does that. We are a charity and I work as a researchdevelopment adviser for the charity . And I am not ahomeopathic practitioner, by the way .Q166 Dr Harris: I want to ask you if you are able to answer this and if you are not, I am sorry , but,presumably , if there is a register\u2014and I know it is an unoYcial register and it is not government- regulated\u2014that means homeopaths who strayoutside what they should do ethically and beyondtheir competence are subject to being struck o V essentially or disciplined? Dr Mathie: Yes. Q167 Dr Harris: I am just wondering why it is that we have not heard, and maybe I have just not heardcorrectly , that the 10 or 11 homeopaths that arewilling to prescribe prophylactic homeopathic anti-malarials, in the absence of advice aboutconventional anti-malarials and bed nets foravoiding being bitten, which is essential,fundamental, rst year medical student advice yougive to a traveller going to a malaria area, whetherany action was taken against them by theirregulatory bodies? Have you or Dr Fisher heardthrough your experience that either this practice isrife or that the penalty is that you cannot advertiseas being a Member of the Faculty? Dr Fisher: It did not involve any member of the Faculty . The Faculty of Homeopathy wasincorporated by Act of Parliament and it onlyadmits registered health professionals and none ofits members were involved in that particular case. Q168 Dr Harris: So it is the Society of Homeopaths I am maybe thinking of? Dr Mathie: To answer your question more completely , the Faculty of Homeopathy is very clearin its statement to its member practitioners thatprophylactic homeopathy is not recommended, andthat includes of course malaria. We would notsupport the use of prophylactic homeopathy formalaria. Q169 Dr Harris: But should the Society of Homeopaths deregister someone who prescribesthem? These things are on the market, are they not?I do not understand why they are on the market ifeven you think they should not be used. It does notmake sense to me. Dr Mathie: It is not for me to suggest the behaviour of the Society of Homeopaths. Q170 Chairman: But you are suggesting, Dr Mathie, that everybody practising homeopathy should beappropriately registered? Dr Mathie: Of course they should be and there is an aim to do just that. Q171 Dr Harris: I really cannot understand this. You say you should not give homeopathic anti-malarials and yet they are on the market. Have youurged or has the Faculty urged or has the BHA,whom you advise scientically , urged manufacturersto stop Evidence Ev 51 25 November 2009 Professor Edzard Ernst, Dr Peter Fisher, Dr Robert Mathie and Dr James Thallon Dr Mathie: Not quite so explicitly but we are unequivocally against the practice.Dr Fisher: I am not aware that homeopathic anti- malarials are on the market, but certain people areusing existing homeopathic medicines and claimingthey will prevent malaria. To my knowledge, they arecertainly not legally on the market labelled \"this willprevent malaria\". Q172 Dr Harris: What was your reaction to the Society of Homeopaths symposium which arguedthat AIDS could be treated homoeopathically? Wereyou embarrassed by that?Dr Fisher: I was not at it and I do not know what happened. Certainly in our hospital, for instance, wehave a complementary cancer treatment servicewhich uses homeopathy , among other things, and we Supplementary memorandum submitted by Professor Edzard Ernst 1. B ackground Following my oral evidence to the committee on Wednesday 25th November 2009 and having read the written evidence published that day , I am submitting this supplementary memo on the references made tosystematic reviews. The memorandum submitted by The British Homeopathic Association (BHA) contains a section on \"systematic reviews of randomised controlled trials\" which requires clarication, particularly as numerousother submissions (e.g. those by Dr Lionel R Milgrom, Prof H Walach, Prof G Lewith, Dr Sara Eames,Society of Homeopaths, Complementary Medicine Research Group, Homeopathy Research Institute,Alliance of Registered Homeopaths, Homeopathy: Medicine for the 21st Century , European CentralCouncil of Homeopaths) also allude to the subject of allegedly positive systematic reviews. 2. C omprehensive Systematic Reviews The BHA state that 4 of a total of 5 comprehensive reviews reached positive conclusions. These reviews are (full references see submission of BHA): 1. Kleijnen et al, BMJ 1991 1 2. Boissel et al, 19962 3. Cucherat et al, Eur J Clin Pharm 20003 4. Linde et al, Lancet 19974 5. Shang et al, Lancet 20055 This statement is misleading for the following reasons: 1. The Kleijnen review1is now 18 years old and thus outdated 2. Boissel et al2merely combined p-values of the included studies. This article is now also outdated. Furthermore it is not unambiguously positive. 3. Cucherat et al3is the publication of the Boissel document which was a EU-sponsored report. 4. Linde et al4has been re-analysed by various authors, including Linde himself, and all of the 6 re- analyses (none of which were cited in the BHA's submission) have come out negative (see myprevious submission to this committee). 5. Shang et al 5very clearly arrived at a devastatingly negative overall conclusion. 3. S ystematic Reviews Focussing on Particular Medical Conditions The BHA cites 17 systematic review of which 5 allegedly \"concluded there was positive evidence for homeopathy\". These relate to the following conditions. 1. Childhood diarrhoea6 2. Post-operative ileus7 3. Seasonal allergic rhinitis (2 reviews)8, 9 4. V ertigo10have recently , indeed, completed a Cochrane review on homeopathy for the management of the adverseeVects of cancer. Q173 Dr Harris: But can you say that you think there is a role for homeopathy in the treatment ofAIDS?Dr Fisher: I have certainly treated people who have AIDS, not for the primary condition but for thecomplications and problems they have with thedisease or with the treatment of it, but I would neverclaim to be able to cure AIDS.Dr Mathie: And nor would we. Chairman: I am sorry , Dr Harris, I am going to nish on that note. Can I thank you all very much indeedfor joining us this morning for what has been Technology Committee: Evidence This statement is equally misleading for the following reasons: 1. Childhood diarrhoea; this is a meta-analysis by the US homeopath Jenifer Jacobs which consists solely of her own 3 trials in this area.6 2. Post-operative ileus; this is our own meta-analysis which included the important caveat that the only reliable trial of good quality in our meta-analysis was clearly negative.7 3. Seasonal allergic rhinitis; two reviews/meta-analyses by Wiesnauer8as well as Taylor9are analyses of the respective authors' own studies. 4. V ertigo; this is a meta-analysis of V ertigohel, a homeopathically diluted preparation which is administered not according to the philosophy of homeopathy but that of homotoxicology (humansare assumed to be poisoned by toxins, particularly those from pork meat consumption!) 10 It seems crucial to stress that one main purpose of science in general and systematic reviews in particular is to insist on independent replication of results. Therefore systematic reviews of author x reviewing nothingbut his or her own studies are complete nonsense. 4. S ystematic Reviews Focussing on Particular Group of Diagnoses Here the BHA claim that 4 positive reviews exist. These relate to 1. Allergies 11 2. Upper respiratory tract infections (2 reviews)12, 13 3. Rheumatic diseases14 This statement is misleading for the following reasons: 1. Allergies. The Bellavite article (eCAM 2006)11is (according to its authors) \"a lecture series\" not aimed to provided a meta-analysis. It clearly is not a systematic review of controlled clinical trialsand includes uncontrolled studies. 2. Upper respiratory tract infections. The Bornhft article (Forsch Komp Med 2006) 12is not a systematic review of controlled clinical trials but a \"Health Technology Assessment\" that includesmostly uncontrolled data. The second Bellaviste article (eCAM 2006) 13has the same limitations as the rst (see above). 3. Rheumatic disease. This review14is based on a selection of the 5 \"rheumatic\" trials from Linde's Lancet meta-analysis (see above). Not enough trials in any specic rheumatic condition wereavailable to allow rm conclusions. Furthermore, the data can be criticised on the same ground asLinde's original Lancet article (see above). 5. S ystematic Reviews Omitted by the BHA It should also be noted that the BHA's evidence omits several systematic reviews and meta-analysis which were published. My list is not necessarily complete and includes: 1. Ernst E. Are highly dilute 1998; J, Ernst E. Methodological rigour and results of clinical trials of homoeopathic remedies. Perfusion 2000;13:132-138. 3. Ernst E, Pittler M H. Reanalysis of previous meta-analysis of clinical 53: 1188. 4. Sterne J, Egger M, Smith, G D. Investigating and dealing with publication and other biases. In Systematic Reviews in Healthcare: Meta-analysis in Context , Pp 189-208. BMJ Publishing Group, 2001. 5. Ernst E. Classical homoeopathy versus conventional treatments: a systematic review. Perfusion 1999; 12: 13-15. It is noteworthy that all of these ve \"forgotten\" systematic reviews must have been known to the BHA as there were cited in my \"systematic review of systematic reviews\" (Br J Pharmacol 2002), 15and that all of them arrived at negative conclusions. 6. S pecific Criticism of the Shang Review5 Several submissions (eg those by the BHA, Dr Sara Eames and the European Central Council of Homeopaths) criticise specically the review by Shang et states that \"all meta-analyses . . . have been broadly positive until the last one published by Shang et al in the Lancet\". The details provided above clearly demonstrate that this is erroneous. \u2014 The European Central Council of Homeopaths state that \"7 out of 8...r eviews/analyses found results in favour of homeopath y...T h e8 t h stud y... Shang et al, has since been severely criticised . . .\" Again, the details provided above here show this to be Evidence Ev 53 It is, of course, unsurprising that numerous homeopaths tried to nd faults with the Shang meta-analysis. It is also clear to me that no such paper can ever be entirely free of limitations. Yet it is equally obvious thatShang et al 5does not stand alone: the vast majority of evaluations by independent experts failed to show that homeopathic remedies are di Verent from placebo.15 Reference List (1) Kleijnen J, Knipschild P Haugh M, Gauthier E.

The previously cited example of vertigo relates actually to comparison with usual care, not with placebo. Q123 Out of the 142 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in total, there are 55 in which the homeopathic medicine was not diluted beyond the point (ie potency 12C and above) where its molecular content isuncertain. Of those 55, there are 38 RCTs with sample size 50 subjects; 18 of those RCTs were non- conclusive or negative; the remaining 20 Table 1 PUBLISHED RCTs WITH POSITIVE FINDINGS, POTENCY '12C, SAMPLE SIZE N (50, INDICATING STATISTICAL POWER STATUS AND NATURE OF CONTROL GROUP (PLACEBO, P/OTHER THAN PLACEBO, OTP) Medical condition Journal reference N Powered P/OTP 1 Ankle sprain Zell J, Connert W D, Mau J, Feuerstake G (1988). 69 Yes P [Treatment of acute sprains of the ankle.

The systematic review concluded that e Vectiveness of the medicine was at least as good as that of usual treatments. A pdf of the paper is attached (Annex 1). Q125 Regarding Professor Ernst's rebuttal that V ertigoheel is \"not even a homeopathic product; this is homotoxicological\", the following statement is submitted, further to Dr Fisher's (Q127), in response: \"The reference to it being a 'homotoxicological product' is incorrect. Homotoxicology is a 'school' of homeopathy that may use V ertigoheel and other homeopathic combination medicines producedin accordance with a nationally recognised homeopathic pharmacopoea as part of this therapeuticapproach.\" Dr Q135 \"Four out of ve\" refers to the comprehensive, global, systematic reviews cited at Q112. As stated then by Dr Fisher, there are also 24 condition-based systematic reviews of homeopathy , 9 of which are positive. Q142 A pdf of the cited paper is attached (Annex 2), as requested by Dr Harris (Q143). Q145 There are 87 RCTs that studied the e Ycacy of a given homeopathic medicine. From those 87, there are 37 RCTs that reported positive ndings\u2014see Table 2 below.

Can you trust systematic reviews of complementary and alternative therapies? European Journal of Integrative Technology Committee: Evidence Monday 30 November 2009 Members present Mr Phil Willis, in the Chair Dr Evan Harris Ian Stewart Dr Brian Iddon Graham Stringer Memorandum submitted by the Department of Health (HO 00) This response was provided by the Department of Health in answer to a Committee question submitted on 30 July 2009 as part of the Innovation, Universities, Science and Skills Committee's \"Evidence Check\". Homeopathy Q1. How does the Government license homeopathic products? Homeopathy has a long tradition in Europe and is a recognised system of medicine across the EU. Homeopathic medicinal products are included in the scope of European Directives and the Medicines Act1968 and therefore require regulation. Under current licensing arrangements, homeopathic products either have Product Licences of Right (PLRs) or certicates granted under a Simplied Scheme, or have been granted homeopathic marketingauthorisations under the National Rules Scheme. PLRs are licences that were issued to all products on themarket at the time that the Medicines Act 1968 was implemented in 1971. The Simplied Scheme for homeopathic medicinal products was introduced in 1992 under European Directive 92/73/EC. The procedure is regarded as simplied because there is no requirement in the Directivefor data to demonstrate clinical e Ycacy and the eligibility criteria confer a certain reassurance on safety so that the data requirements on safety are usually minimal. The Simplied Scheme does not permit therapeuticindications to be stated on the product label. In 2006, the UK introduced the National Rules Scheme, which allows the marketing of homeopathic products, with a strictly limited range of therapeutic indications under European Directive 2001/83, inaccordance with the principles and characteristics of homeopathy as practised. Only products which areindicated for the relief of minor symptoms and minor conditions in humans are eligible for a homeopathicmarketing authorisation under this scheme. For these purposes, minor symptoms are those which canordinarily and with reasonable safety be relieved or treated without the supervision or intervention of adoctor. The Simplied Scheme, which has been operating successfully in the UK for 17 years, and the new National Rules Scheme ensure that consumers who choose to use homeopathic products are better informed about their purpose, and that they are assured that standards of quality and safety are maintained. Q2. What scientic evidence was considered during the formulation of the licensing regime? Because homeopathic products have a long and established traditional use in the UK, the licensing regime functions primarily to ensure that they are both safe and of suitable quality . It also functions to provideimproved and consistent product information for consumers. The three elements of the licensing regime probably lie outside the scope of the IUSS Select Committee Inquiry , because government consideration of scientic evidence was not the basis for their establishment. Firstly , the Product Licences of Right were granted to all existing marketed medicines in 1971, under the provisions of the Medicines Act 1968. Secondly , the Simplied Scheme derives from European Directive 92/73/EC, so probably lies outside the scope of the Inquiry; and Thirdly , no scientic evidence was examined in drawing up the National Rules Scheme, which also derives from a European Directive. Denitions of \"product safety\" and \"product quality\" are commonlyunderstood and did not need to be embedded in the scheme itself. Therefore, the onus to provide supportivescientic evidence is on each individual product that manufacturers put through the scheme\u2014todemonstrate that the product is used as a homeopathic medicine, that it is safe, and that it is of suitablequality Evidence Ev 61 Memorandum submitted by the Department of Health (HO 34) Executive Summary of Main Points 1. Decisions on commissioning and funding of any treatment are the responsibility of the National Health Service and the Government expects local providers and practitioners to take into account issues todo with safety , clinical and cost-e Vectiveness, and the availability of suitably regulated/qualied practitioners. 2. The Department of Health has tried to ensure there is good quality , accessible information available about complementary and alternative treatments so that consumers can make informed decisions if they areconsidering using any such treatment. NHS Choices is creating a directory of available CAM services anda package of information about the various therapies. 3. Homeopathic products are licensed by the MHRA and either have Product Licences of Right (PLRs), have been granted certicates under a Simplied Scheme, or have been granted homeopathic marketingauthorizations under the National Rules Scheme. 4. There is capacity for research into Complementary and Alternative Medicine therapies through the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) which rarely turns down high quality proposals. NICEconsiders particular CAM therapies (where suitable evidence exists) alongside conventional treatmentswhen developing clinical guidelines for specic conditions but it cannot provide a blanket assessment of aparticular type of treatment. 5. The only complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) practitioners regulated by statute are chiropractic and osteopathy and a consultation is currently underway to consider whether, and if so how,to regulate acupuncture, herbal medicine and traditional Chinese Medicine practitioners. There are no plansto regulate homeopathic practitioners by statute. Brief Introduction 6. Commissioning in the National Health Service is a collaborative process involving all partners including patients, public, local authorities, clinicians and is focused on outcomes. This paper will seek toprovide the background to the commissioning of homeopathy on the National Health Service. 7. Homeopathy is a controversial subject and one on which the Department of Health receives correspondence both for and against in equal volume. The Department does not maintain a position on anycomplementary or alternative treatments, leaving decisions on their use bythe National Health Service, to the National Health Service. 8. Clinicians need to take into account any policies on commissioning such services that their Primary Care Trust may have in place. They also need to be mindful of their obligations in relation to patient choiceand Joint Strategic Needs Assessment. 9. There are three NHS Homeopathic Hospitals in England\u2014these are located in London, Bristol and Liverpool. There was another Homeopathic Hospital based in Tunbridge Wells which ceased providingservices in March 2009 following a signicant drop in referrals in recent years and, following a publicconsultation, a decision to stop commissioning and funding treatments at the hospital. Scotland has oneNHS homeopathic hospital located in Glasgow. 10. The homeopathic hospitals fall under the jurisdiction of the NHS trust in which they are based. National Health Service Commissioning Background 11. Commissioning is the process by which healthcare services are secured to meet the needs of the populations. Primary Care Trusts (PCTs) are responsible for commissioning high quality care services,within allocated resources, to meet local patient needs and with a clear focus on improving health outcomesfor the population. 12. Commissioning is one of the most important vehicles for delivering the NHS vision of a health and care system that is fair, personalised, e Vective and safe, and focused on reducing health inequalities, adding life to years and years to life. 13. In 2005, the Department published Commissioning a Patient led NHS . It focused on the process needed for e Vective commissioning, and precipitated a large-scale restructure of PCTs into larger organisations. Since this time, the focus of our programmes has been on developing PCT commissioningcapability by developing an inspiring vision and a means for achieving it. 14. Weaknesses in NHS commissioning were identied through the Fitness for Purpose exercise (May 2006-March 2007). A joint review in May 2007 by the Department and the Prime Ministers Delivery Unithighlighted similar challenges and identied a number of recommendations to ensure all PCTs become moreeVective commissioners. The world class commissioning programme was established in response to these Technology Committee: Evidence World class commissioning 15. World class commissioning (WCC) seeks to bring a di Verent approach to PCT commissioning: one that is focused on outcomes and one that involves all partners including patients, public, local authorities,clinicians and providers in making tough choices about priorities and how to deliver them. 16. WCC has been developed in partnership with the service involving representatives from SHAs, PCTs, Local Government and external stakeholder organisations. The service has welcomed this way of workingthrough co-production. 17. There are three main components of the WCC programme: the vision for WCC, an assurance system that holds commissioners to account and to reward performance and development and an ongoingframework of support and development to ensure that commissioners have the resources to enable them toachieve WCC. NHS spend on homeopathic products and services (including NHS homeopathic hospitals) 18. Data on spending in the area of homeopathy on the National Health Service has never been routinely collected. However, we have requested that Primary Care Trusts provide estimates on this to theDepartment, through their Strategic Health Authority , at the earliest opportunity . We have also asked fordetails about what they base their decisions on when commissioning and funding homeopathy . Why the NHS funds homeopathy 19. The Department does not maintain a position on any complementary or alternative treatments, leaving decisions on their use bythe National Health Service, tothe National Health Service. The Government expects local providers and practitioners to take into account issues to do with safety , clinicaland cost-e Vectiveness, and the availability of suitably regulated/qualied practitioners. Each of these are considered in detail below. What evidence the NHS has considered in its decision to fund homeopathy 20. The Department of Health has tried to ensure there is good quality , accessible information available about complementary and alternative treatments so that consumers can make informed decisions if they areconsidering using any such treatment. NHS Choices is creating a directory of available CAM services anda package of information about the various therapies. In the meantime however there is a considerableamount of information about homeopathy on the NHS Evidence website (www.evidence.nhs.uk). Research 21. There are over 20 systematic reviews, and in excess of 150 trials, of homeopathy . The Department considers for this reason that commissioning a further systematic review would not be appropriate.However, the Department is one of the largest mainstream UK funders of research into complementary andalternative medicine (CAM). 22. The Department of Health commissions research to underpin policy and practice in health and healthcare through the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) and the DH Policy ResearchProgramme. 23. The Department does not exclude, a priori , any areas from investigation and has funded and continues to fund research on various branches of CAM. Over the last 10 years, central funding and localNHS R&D budgets have both contributed to the total investment. 24. Implementation of the Department's research strategy Best Research for Best Health has resulted in an expansion of our research programmes and in signicant new funding opportunities for health research.The strategy is delivered by the NIHR. 25. DH-funded research aims to support the best science and so achieve the best outcomes for patients and for the NHS. For that reason our NIHR programmes do not ring fence funds for expenditure onparticular topics. Research proposals in all areas compete for the funding available. Applications are thenare subject to peer review and judged in open competition, with awards being made on the basis of thescientic quality of the proposals made. 26. A number of NIHR awards have been made in the last year or so in support of studies directly concerned with demonstrating whether specic CAM therapies work and whether they represent goodvalue. If researchers continue to come up with high quality proposals, there is no reason why they shouldnot continue to attract NIHR support 27. A \u00a33.4 million complementary and alternative medicine personal award scheme was included in our research capacity development programme. The scheme, which began in 2003, has supported 18 CAMresearchers at the doctoral and postdoctoral level. These award holders have undertaken a total of Ev 63 and have nurtured the methodological skills of the more junior researchers in their teams. Their presence in the Research Development Capacity Programme has allowed factors specic to CAM practice to beincorporated into approved generic research methodologies. 28. The Department has also funded research on the role of CAM in the care of cancer patients (three projects were commissioned, are complete and have been published); and on the use of complementarymedicine in primary care. 29. The research capacity development programme also funds CAMEOL (Complementary and Alternative Medicine Evidence Online). This is a collaboration between the Research Council forComplementary Medicine and the University of Westminster School of Integrated Health. It involves adetailed review and critical appraisal of the published research in specic complementary therapies, focusingon their use in NHS priority areas. 30. The R&D funding regime that operated from 1998 to 2006\u2014under which we allocated some \u00a3500 million a year to individual NHS organisations\u2014gave those organisations the means of supporting alarge number of projects concerned with the use of CAM. The former National Research Register lists well over 100. It also allowed the Department to provide research and development support to the Royal LondonHomeopathic Hospital. Safety :Licensing of Homeopathic Products 31. Homeopathy has a long tradition in Europe and is a recognised and widely used system of medicine across the EU. The Government takes the view that consumers who choose to use homeopathic medicinesshould be fully informed about their purpose and assured that standards of quality and safety aremaintained. 32. If homeopathic medicines were not subject to any kind of regulatory control consumers would not have access to such information or assurances. Conversely , if regulation was applied to homeopathics asunderstood in the context of conventional pharmaceutical medicines, these products would have to bewithdrawn from the market as medicines. This would constrain consumer choice and, more importantly ,risk the introduction of unregulated, poor quality and potentially unsafe products on the market to satisfyconsumer demand. 33. Under current licensing arrangements, homeopathic products either have Product Licences of Right (PLRs), have been granted certicates under a Simplied Scheme, or have been granted homeopathicmarketing authorizations under the National Rules Scheme. PLRs are licences that were issued to allproducts on the market at the time that the Medicines Act 1968 was implemented in 1971. 34. The Simplied Scheme for homeopathic medicinal products was introduced in 1992 under European Directive 92/73/EC. In 2006, the UK introduced the National Rules Scheme, which allows the marketing ofhomeopathic products, with a strictly limited range of therapeutic indications in accordance with theprinciples and characteristics of homeopathy as practised in the UK. Only products which are indicated forthe relief of minor symptoms and minor conditions in humans are eligible for a homeopathic marketingauthorization under this scheme. For these purposes, minor symptoms are those which can ordinarily andwith reasonable safety be relieved or treated without the supervision or intervention of a doctor. 35. Applicants for both the Simplied Scheme and the National Rules scheme must submit a dossier demonstrating the safety and quality of the product. Safety and quality are monitored during the life cycleof the product in similar terms to pharmaceutical medicines with full marketing authorisations. The schemesrecognise that these products contain a very low level of active principles and recognises the di Yculty of applying to them the conventional statistical methods relating to clinical trials. However, the regulatoryframework requires that in accordance with the principles and characteristics of homeopathy as practisedin the Member State, the applicant must provide one or more of the following: \u2014 Study reports in relation to the product which is the subject of the application;\u2014 Published scientic literature;\u2014 The method by which the prole of a homeopathic remedy is determined 36. Whatever data are provided must be su Ycient to demonstrate that UK homeopathic practitioners would accept the e Ycacy of the product for the indications sought. Clinical and Cost-Effectiveness : NICE and CAM T herapies 37. This Government established NICE to provide authoritative, independent advice on di Verent health- related interventions and pathways of care, increase fairness in access to treatments, to be a national sourceof robust clinical guidance and to speed up the uptake of cost-e Vective treatments Technology Committee: Evidence 38. NICE helps to tackle variations in prescribing practice by issuing robust, evidence-based guidance which we expect clinicians to take fully into account. NICE also spreads good practice, and helps protectpatients from out-dated or unproven treatments. Broadly , NICE develops four forms of clinical guidance:clinical guidelines (management of particular clinical conditions), technology appraisal guidance (guidanceon specic health interventions, including pharmaceuticals), public health guidance and guidance on thesafety and e Ycacy of interventional procedures. 39. NICE considers particular CAM therapies (where suitable evidence exists) alongside conventional treatments when developing clinical guidelines for specic conditions. Some guidelines produced by NICEhave already included references to CAM therapies\u2014most recently in May 2009 guidance on non-speciclower back pain including recommendations for the use of osteopathy , spinal manipulation and massage. 40. What NICE cannot produce, however, is blanket guidance on complementary medicine, which has been called for in the past. 41. Where possible, we have also aimed to develop the evidence base on which NICE makes its judgements on clinical and cost-e Vectiveness. Regulation of Homeopathic Practitioners 42. At present there is no statutory regulation system in the UK governing the practice of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM), with the exception of chiropractic and osteopathy which are regulated bystatute. A report (May 2008) from a UK working group made recommendations which are the subject of aconsultation which ends on 2 November 2009. It seeks respondents' views on whether, and if so how, toregulate acupuncture, herbal medicine and traditional Chinese Medicine practitioners. 43. Once the consultation responses have been analysed, a decision will be made as to whether or not to move towards statutory regulation of these professions. Previous experience of regulating new professionssuggests that, if a decision were made to regulate these professions by statute, we would be unlikely to reachstatutory regulation until 2011-12 at the earliest. 44. DH commissioned the Prince's Foundation for Integrated Health (FIH) to develop voluntary self- regulation amongst a range of currently unregulated therapies. FIH were awarded a Government grant of\u00a3900,000 over three years to carry out this work. As a result of the work carried out by the working group,the Complementary and Natural Healthcare Council (CNHC) was set up in 2008 and its register opened inJanuary 2009. 45. The CNHC is a new voluntary professional regulator. Individuals who belong to one of the therapies it covers may choose to register with it (but do not have to do so). Registration with the CNHC will enhancepublic safety as it gives assurances that the practitioner has met certain entry standards (eg has an accreditedqualication), that they subscribe to a set of professional standards, and hold appropriate and su Ycient insurance. Breach of these standards could result in removal from the register. The Department of Healthsupports the work of the CNHC and has funded its start up costs.

This is an inquiry whichfollows a series of evidence checks across a numberof government departments to see whether in factthere was any evidence to support the Government's policy towards homeopathy . I want to make thatabsolutely clear. I wonder if we can therefore startwith you, Minister. Does the Government have anycredible evidence that homeopathy works beyondthe placebo e Vect? Mr O'Brien: Certainly there is the placebo e Vect. There was also some research done in NorthernIreland in an examination of the e Vect of a number of complementary and alternative medicines notincluding homeopathy . Q175 Chairman: Keep with homeopathy . Mr O'Brien: In that case the straight answer is no. Q176 Chairman: The answer is Ev 65 30 November 2009 Mr Mike O'Brien QC, MP, Professor Kent Woods and Professor David Harper CBE Professor Harper: This is clearly a very challenging area. There are mixed views from the scienticcommunity , as you are well aware from the evidencethat already has been given, but I think it isundoubtedly the case that the majority ofindependent scientists feel that the evidence is weakor absent. Q177 Chairman: Can you point us to any specic piece of scientic evidence which would stand up tonormal scientic scrutiny that the Department hasused to support the Government's policy onhomeopathy? Professor Harper: There are a number of meta- analyses and randomised controlled trials and Ithink you have heard and seen from previousevidence that it is possible to be quite selective abouthow that information is used. One of the realdiYculties that we face is that it is not so much a lack of research or a lack of randomised controlled trials;it is a lack of agreement between experts working inthis eld. Q178 Chairman: But you have a key responsibility within the Department of Health, you are the ChiefScientist within the Department of Health; can youpoint me to a single piece of clear evidence thatsupports the use of public money on homeopathy? Professor Harper: I really cannot add very much to what I said that the evidence base is\u2014 Q179 Chairman: Can you point me to any specic piece of evidence? Professor Harper: There are papers. There is a paper that was quoted\u2014 Q180 Chairman: You tell me one. You are the Chief Scientist. Can you tell me one? Professor Harper: There is a paper but it seems a strange one to pick out because there are a whole lotof randomised trials and what I am saying to you isfor every one that is picked out to support one pointof view there is another that is picked out to\u2014 Q181 Chairman: No, that is not what I am asking you. You are the Department's Chief Scientist. Canyou give me one specic reference which supportsthe use of homeopathy in terms of Governmentpolicy on health? Professor Harper: Yes, if we could come back to how we use evidence in policy-making, a randomisedcontrolled trial was on the e Vects of arnica as a homeopathic remedy . That was published some timeago and shortly afterwards there was anotherrandomised controlled trial. This was using arnica asa means of reducing inflammation in knee surgerybut there was another paper that was publishedshortly afterwards that said that that paper did notdemonstrate that, so you can pull out di Verent randomised controlled trials that will demonstrateone thing or another.Q182 Chairman: Okay . Professor Kent Woods, can I push you on the same question. Are you aware ofany evidence to show that homeopathy worksbeyond the placebo e Vect? Professor Woods: One has to look at the totality of the evidence and in my view there is no single pieceof evidence that gives that reassurance. It is di Ycult from the point of view of research in that theunderlying theory does not really give rise to manytestable hypotheses and therefore I think theresearch e Vort has been bedevilled by that. One could then ask what about the empirical evidencethat homeopathy has a benecial e Vect and, as you have heard, the studies are ambiguous; they presenta variety of results. In aggregate I do not think thereis anything there that one would take as robustevidence of an e Vect over and above the placebo eVect, which can of course be quite powerful in its own right in some individuals. From the point ofview of evidence, certainly from a regulatoryperspective, it is very important evidence thatsomething like ten per cent of the population haveused a homeopathic remedy or have gone to ahomeopath in the previous 12 months, and that Ithink is a starting point for deciding what is thepublic health signicance of this phenomenon. It isthe way in which they are used rather than, as yousaid in your very rst words, the argument about whether homeopathy works or not. I think in termsof developing evidence we have to acknowledge thatthere are some people who rmly believe thathomeopathy works. There is a degree of use whichsuggests we might have to consider the public healthimplications of a signicant group of people usinghomeopathic remedies and if there are potentialpublic health implications, how should we regulateit? Q183 Chairman: So if a signicant number of people believed in witchcraft we would seriously considerthat? Mr O'Brien: That really is not what people here are saying. With the greatest respect, Chairman, youhave asked two di Verent questions here, both of which elicited slightly di Verent answers, and I want to be exactly clear what you are saying. You tried toexclude the placebo e Vect. What you asked was whether there was any evidence, by which I assumedyou meant, and I think so did both my colleagues,any empirical peer group-assessed\u2014 Q184 Chairman: The word I used was \"credible\" evidence. Mr O'Brien: In which case we assumed that you meant empirical evidence which has been peergroup-assessed and validated. The answer to that isbeyond the placebo e Vect, which is powerful, and the fact that some doctors and those who are well-qualied take the view that it does have an e Vect, but it is not been validated in the sense of a peer group-assessed empirical study (of which I am aware atleast) to show the full validity . There is nonethelesssome evidence that the placebo Committee: Evidence 30 November 2009 Mr Mike O'Brien QC, MP, Professor Kent Woods and Professor David Harper CBE is also a body of people who are reputable who take the view that it works and it is therefore the case thatwe have a body of people who believe in it\u2014and Ithink that is probably the best word. However, if youare asking me as a minister do I have evidence thatit works which is empirical and peer group-assessed,the answer is no, but that does not mean there is nojustication for the Government policy , so I think wejust need to be clear about that. Q185 Chairman: That is fair and the reason for having you here, Minister, is to make exactly thatdefence of Government policy . If in fact e Ycacy has not been proven, and it would in any other areawhere you are spending money on behalf of thetaxpayers within this very , very vital area of health,do you feel that more research should be done andtherefore you should be spending more money onresearch or would that simply be throwing goodmoney away? Mr O'Brien: Of course, we have spent some money , in fact \u00a3910,000 over three years, in trying to getsome regulation set up in this area. We also took theview at the start of this year that it would be useful toundertake some testing of some of the homeopathic\"medicines\". At this point we have not started sucha study . We were looking to see the outcome of theNorthern Ireland study which did not deal withhomeopathic medicine but did deal withcomplementary and alternative medicines ofdiVerent kinds. We took the view that we would wait a while to look at the overall budgetary situationbefore deciding whether to proceed with this. Q186 Chairman: In terms of Government policy in terms of homeopathy you are not really saying thatit is evidence-based other than that there is acommunity who believe that they work? Mr O'Brien: Yes. Q187 Chairman: And you feel that that is acceptable? Mr O'Brien: And also that there is a placebo e Vect, so there are the two arguments there. Certainly interms of the placebo e Vect there is a view that that makes a signicant number of people better, ifindeed it be a placebo, and there is also a communityof GPs and others who take the view that this is anarea which does work, and therefore we take the view as ministers that it is not our job in relation tothis, which is a somewhat controversial area\u2014againI say in inverted commas\u2014of \"medicine\", to stopclinicians who take the view they want to prescribeit from doing so. Q188 Dr Harris: Could I just pursue that because I understand where you are coming from and Iempathise with your position. I do not think it iscontroversial in any of the evidence we have had thatthere is a placebo e Vect and that might well be powerful enough to justify a number of policiesbased on it, as Professor Woods said.Mr O'Brien: Can I just pause you there. We do not need to justify it. What we need to do is the opposite.We would need to justify stopping the funding now.It is a subtle but possibly important di Verence. Q189 Dr Harris: I think this comes up in a question I was going to ask anyway myself\u2014but I will beinterrupted if I am wrong\u2014the placebo e Vect is stronger, it is understood, when people do not realiseit is a placebo e Vect. When people are told it is a placebo e Vect, strangely , studies have shown it is still there but it is signicantly weaker and therefore lesseVective and therefore less cost-e Vective. Minister, do you think it is appropriate to fund a placebo e Vect and maximise its e Vectiveness by essentially deceiving patients into thinking that they are takinga substance that has memory of it in the water andwhich they are told would work because there areindications for it but in fact it is only placebo e Vect, or should we say , \"This is a placebo. Here you are;hope it works\", ethically? Mr O'Brien: If I were to take that view, then I would be assuming that doctors who are prescribing thisare doing so only in the belief that it has a placeboeVect and that they do not actually have a view, however formed, that this actually has some degree of eYcacy . As I understand it, most of the doctors who take the view that they are going to practise inthis area take the view that it has validity . Thequestion is whether it does or not, and there is thatdebate, but if you are suggesting would doctorsmerely prescribe something which they knew to be aplacebo, they might decide to do that for properprofessional and ethical reasons, but should theythen go to the extent of prescribing more generallyhomeopathy , not believing that any of it works, thenI think that would place them in a very di Ycult ethical position. Q190 Dr Harris: That is very curious because what you are saying is, let us assume that it does not workbeyond placebo, let us have that as an assumptionfor this question only , that would mean that for onedoctor, who had it right, it what would be unethicalfor a doctor who was correct in knowing that it didnot work but still said, \"This will help,\" and thatwould be unethical because they were not of the viewthat it worked, whereas it would be entirely ethicalfor a doctor to prescribe something where they werewrong because they thought it worked. That is myrst question. Secondly , where would that end? Youcould send someone to an astrologer\u2014and there aredoctors, believe me, I have met them, who believe inastrology\u2014and they would say , \"I think this works;try that\", and that would have a placebo e Vect as well in many patients who also thought that theconstellations when they were born impacted ontheir health or well-being now. Mr O'Brien: Certainly I think doctors can, if they feel that there is an ethical and e Ycacious reason for doing so, prescribe a placebo. It may well be theirview that that would assist a particular patient. Ithink they would have to think carefully Ev 67 30 November 2009 Mr Mike O'Brien QC, MP, Professor Kent Woods and Professor David Harper CBE it, but I suspect they could probably justify that. If, however, they prescribed homeopathy believing in it,as I think is your argument, and believing that it hadan e Ycacious outcome, would they be somehow wrong to do that? Of course if they believed it wouldhave a benet why would they be wrong toprescribe it? Q191 Dr Harris: So you are saying it is ethical. Is it the Government's view that it is ethical to prescribea placebo on the basis that\u2014Mr O'Brien: I think you have to separate two things. Q192 Dr Harris: What is your advice to doctors on the NHS here, please?Mr O'Brien: You have to separate two things here. The Government's position is very clear. TheGovernment's position is that this is a controversialarea of \"medicine\"\u2014and let us assume we put thequotes wherever I make such reference in future\u2014and it should be a matter for clinicians to makedecisions in relation to this area, in conjunction withdiscussions with the primary care trust who have aresponsibility for funding any medicine that isprescribed. That is our view, so in terms of the ethics,as you put it, of the situation, I think we would bereliant upon the professional organisations in orderto regulate the judgments that clinicians make aboutwhat kind of medicine should be prescribed. Youwere asking me to speculate and I did that a little bitbut then you turned to what is the Government'sposition and I just want you to be clear that there isa Government position. What you were inviting meto do was speculate and I followed your invitation. Q193 Dr Harris: I am not clear. Maybe to be clear, let me ask you, would you as a patient be happy tobe given something that did not work but be told itworked in the hope that it would make you better, sopaternalistic deception? No-one is proteering outof this in terms of the relationship between you andthe GP . Would you be happy as a patient to be misledin that way if it made you better?Mr O'Brien: I would not be happy to be misled and I suspect most patients would not. However, thatwas not the question you asked me. What you wereasking me was a di Verent question, with respect, which was whether it would be unethical for a doctorever to prescribe a placebo. That seemed to me to bewhat you were asking. I thought about it and I tookthe view that there might be circumstances, butwould you generally do it? Of course you would not. Q194 Dr Harris: I do not want to drag you back to what you think you have answered. Let us go on tothis one: so you are saying that you do not thinkmost patients would want to be prescribedsomething that did not work and be paternalisticallymisled in that?Mr O'Brien: I would not want to be told that\u2014 Q195 Dr Harris: Should we ask each patient? Mr O'Brien: \u2014a sugar tablet\u2014let us move away from homeopathy for a moment\u2014would dosomething that it would not. However, it is the caseof course that for all sorts of reasons, particularly for research, it may well be that a sugar tablet isprescribed to some patients for comparison with anoperating drug as part of a trial. There are all sortsof reasons why that may be done. Q196 Dr Harris: It is said to be randomised and there is very clear informed consent that theyconsent to be randomised to active treatment orplacebo, so that, with respect, is an entirely di Verent matter. Let us move on to this question of researchto something that was touched on in the Chairman'squestion but not fully dealt with. We heard evidencethat there is a settled view out there, the one thatProfessor Harper gave, looking across thesystematic reviews of the evidence base, that there isweak or absent evidence for the e Vectiveness or the eYcacy of homeopathy , so the question was put to us, indeed it was put in the previous evidence sessionwe had by a number of our witnesses; is it wise forNHS or MRC or any other publicly funded money ,or indeed patient time, to be put into more researchin this area, because you will be aware that ifsomething is settled then it is unethical (I thinkProfessor Woods would agree) or at least it is hardto get ethical approval for a trial that is not going toachieve anything. There is a threshold that has to bepassed of usefulness. The question is: do you thinkon the basis of what your chief scientic adviser saysabout the settled nature of the view that there isroom for research using public money on the e Ycacy of homeopathy?Mr O'Brien: There is a level of public interest and controversy , and there is a strong medical lobby infavour of homeopathy , and there is also governmentfunding. Okay , in terms of drugs it is \u00a3152,000 out ofa massive \u00a311 billion drugs budget, so therefore it isquite a small amount in that drugs budget but it is\u00a3152,000 nonetheless. Should we look into how thatmoney is spent? I think there is an argument fordoing that, yes. What your argument seems to be isbecause at the moment the generally settled view isthat there is not an empirically peer group testedpiece of research which justies it, that therefore weshould not do that research. Q197 Dr Harris: That was not my point. Do not go on any more. I will just say it one more time becausethis is key and it is a question that we really have tohave answered. There is a view out there, and I thinkit is the orthodox scientic opinion, and I think theview of Professor Harper, that if you look across allthe systematic reviews of all the trials there is nogood evidence that homeopathy works, and the viewis further that there is no point doing any morerandomised controlled trials or indeed any moresystematic reviews. They have been done to deathand the answer is negative. On that basis, can youjustify spending any more taxpayers' money onresearching a question for which the settled view isthat it is not going to change the research? We do notfund research into exploring whether the earth is flat.It is a settled view that it is not. I would like to askyou, Minister, and then maybe the other two couldanswer. I hope that question is Committee: Evidence 30 November 2009 Mr Mike O'Brien QC, MP, Professor Kent Woods and Professor David Harper CBE Mr O'Brien: It was not clear earlier and I am grateful to you for clarifying it. As far as the research isconcerned, my view is that because there is asignicant area of controversy around this. You canraise your eyebrows. I can do those sorts of thingstoo, Evan\u2014 Q198 Dr Harris: The record will show I said nothing! Mr O'Brien: It does not in any way change the fact that there is a group of people who are qualied, theyare clinicians, who take a view that this thing works.You may well take the view, I may well take the view,Professor Harper and Professor Woods may take theview that there is not the scientic body of evidenceto justify it, but there is still a group of people whobelieve that this stu Vworks. Not only that\u2014 Q199 Dr Harris: But your scientic adviser says look at the evidence\u2014Mr O'Brien: Not only that\u2014let me nish\u2014but it does have a placebo e Vect which I think not even you would dispute. Therefore, is it worth researchinginto? I think there is an argument for doing that, yes,given that there is NHS money being spent on it andhas been over a considerable period of time, so thestraight answer to your question is yes. Despite thefact that I can see exactly what Professor Harper hassaid and to a signicant extent what you have said,there still is justication. Q200 Dr Harris: Professor Harper? Professor Harper: I think it might be helpful to distinguish between what I started talking about\u2014randomised controlled trials and meta-analyses ofthat sort of information\u2014and other types ofresearch because I think, as the Minister is saying,there is, looking at orthodoxy , to use your word, orconventional scientic thinking, a lack of scienticplausibility in how homeopathic remedies mightwork. That is not to say there should not be researchinto like cures like or molecular memory . I think thati sad i Verent thing. Q201 Dr Harris: But RCTs using patients? Professor Harper: If you are talking about randomised controlled trials, I personally do notthink it is an issue of conducting more randomisedcontrolled trials because there are a whole lot thathave been done and meta-analyses. Q202 Dr Harris: So you would advise the Government against doing it? Even though youheard the Minister say that it is controversial andmoney is being spent, your advice would be not to?Professor Harper: I think there are two di Verent things here. If we are talking about research orrandomised controlled trials\u2014 Q203 Dr Harris: RCTs, yes. Professor Harper: I do not think the Minister was necessarily aware that you were talking only aboutrandomised controlled trials. I think he was thinkingof research in a broader sense and what I am sayingis that there might be room for looking at thescientic plausibility of homeopathic remedies.Q204 Dr Harris: But not RCTs. Mr O'Brien: We were looking at the outcome of the Northern Ireland test. I think I said earlier that therewas no homeopathy involved. I think there wassome small bit involved, but that is what we werelooking at earlier this year, and I think the real issueis what priority you would put on to that researchand the answer is at the moment not a high one. Thatsort of takes further your question, but we werelooking at whether we would have a similar pilotlooking at homeopathy in the UK or not. At themoment we have not decided to do that; we arelooking at the nancing of it. Chairman: I know Graham Stringer wants to come in here briefly . Q205 Graham Stringer: Mike, can I take you back to the ethics question. If you put randomised trials toone side, and if you put to one side doctors whoprescribe sugar pills because they believe they have amalingerer and they do not want to waste the NHS'smoney , is not the real ethical question that ifsomebody is genuinely poorly and you prescribe aplacebo that actually you are denying them access toa drug that might have some e Vect and would almost certainly have as much of a placebo e Vect as a placebo, so you are actually reducing the care or thepotential treatment for that patient? Does that notmake it unethical to prescribe sugar pills and water? Mr O'Brien: In terms of how a clinician makes an individual decision about how they treat theirpatient, I understand your question and it is a perfectly reasonable one to ask generally to aMember of Parliament, but I think what you arereally asking me as a government minister, which isa slightly di Verent category , is whether it would be unethical in every single situation and therefore if asa matter of policy I would take a view on it, and thenthe answer is I would say that that is a decision whichwould appropriately be made between the clinicianand a patient. I may well have a view on that as anindividual. There may well be ethical issues aroundit but, as a Minister, is it my job to tell clinicians, inwhat may be some very particular circumstances, indetail what their ethical approach to a patient shouldbe, I think that goes an a little bit beyond the brief. Q206 Graham Stringer: I think any Minister who starts interfering with clinical decisions is headingfor the scrap heap, we can agree on that, but what wehave here is regulations that apply to homeopathicproducts which amount, not in every single casebecause there are other things governed by it, tohanding out water and sugar pills, knowing that tobe so, and the Government has regulated this. I donot think you can quite get o Vthe hook by saying you will not interfere with an individual clinicaldecision, and I would agree with that, but what thequestion gets to is the ethics of having regulationsregularly for handing out sugar pills. Mr O'Brien: The question for me is who does that? The appropriate bodies would be the professionalbodies rather than the government. I think Ev 69 30 November 2009 Mr Mike O'Brien QC, MP, Professor Kent Woods and Professor David Harper CBE where government needs to be involved is how are these decisions to be made, not the detail ofindividual decisions in particular cases. Are we in aposition where we should say\u2014and it was the pointI made earlier to Evan\u2014that you should be able todo this or are we making a decision, as I would be asa Minister in relation to this, that we should not, thatwe should stop funding homeopathy , and I do notbelieve at this stage that I would be in a position,despite all we have discussed, to say thathomeopathy should not be funded because a viewmight be taken that it was similar to giving water anda sugar pill. That is not the situation I am in at themoment, so ethically it should be the professionalbodies who make that discussion and the GP , not atthis point a Minister. Q207 Chairman: So when the medical director of the NHS West Kent, who was a witness before us lastweek, said it was unethical to deliberately prescribea placebo, you would support him in that becausethat is his decision down the food chain? Mr O'Brien: He is entitled to take a view on that. If a clinician takes a view that is di Verent from that, am I going to have to support that clinician and supportthe person you have just described? As a Minister,what I am doing is saying that people are entitled toall sorts of views that they may have on ethics -- Q208 Chairman: But the clinical director of an NHS Trust is more than just an individual. He is stating apolicy for the whole of that NHS Trust. Mr O'Brien: He is stating a view for that area as he is entitled to do because he has discussed it with hiscolleagues and taken a view. Other people in theNHS may take a di Verent view. They may even be at the GP level; they may take a view that, in aparticular circumstance, they want to take this step.As a Minister should I say: \"There is no way you canever do that because it is unethical for you to do that,Mr GP\"? No. Q209 Ian Stewart: Good afternoon. I am one of the two non scientists on this Committee and I have a completely open mind. I have never usedhomeopathic remedies and I want to keep an openmind, but it is important in pursuing the questionthat the Chairman outlined right at the beginning,that we ask pointed questions. My constituents andother MPs' constituents will have written to themsaying: \"We are totally against or we are totally forthe provision of homeopathic remedies on theNHS\". One of the things that any reasoned personwould say is: \"How do you research these issues?How do you make the decisions?\" It is quite di Ycult and I thought you gave an interesting answer, MrO'Brien, on the Government's view, but one of thethings we are told in the approach to homeopathicremedies is the subject of provings, and as I haveread my papers I have come to realise there is morethan one denition of a proving. To start with you,Kent, the MHRA is supposed to ensure that medicines and medical devices work and areacceptable and safe. Is there any justication,therefore, for the MHRA to continue to licensehomeopathic products under any scheme? Professor Woods: That is a very important question, and I should set the background. The Agency's roleis specically about trying to protect and promotepublic health through regulating products which areused in medical care and, as you heard, there is asignicant use of these products in medical care.Therefore our concern is to put limits around howthat is done in ways which will protect patients, forinstance, from the use of a homeopathic remedy in asituation where they have a serious condition whichneeds an orthodox remedy . The background to theregulation of homeopathy going back 40 or 50 years has struggled with this issue that you have the matterof patient choice; you have, if you like, a beliefsystem which is very strong, an evidence base whichdoes not lend itself easily to being tested, and youcan never prove a negative. Q210 Ian Stewart: Let me then put a sceptical point of view to you, so we can hear your answer. Somepeople would ask, is it the purpose of the NationalRule Scheme to facilitate the growth of thehomeopathic industry? Professor Woods: No, and, if it were, it has failed because since the National Rule Scheme wasintroduced we have exactly one product registeredunder it since 2006. There was a somewhatdisorderly situation following on from the 1968Medicines Act, and the number of homeopathicproducts which had so-called product licences ofright, they had been there before 1968, they had theright to stay on the market with whatever indicationswere attached to them at that time. Then there wasthe EU Directive, which came into force in 1992\u2014 Mr O'Brien: It was passed in 1992 and came into eVect in May 1993. Professor Woods: That is right, and that was the simplied scheme which essentially said, rstly , youcannot make any claims for the indications of thisproduct because we do not think you can provideevidence of e Ycacy , but at the same time you do not have to submit any evidence of safety provided theproduct is so dilute it could not conceivably containanything noxious because most of it is water, in fact,all of it is water. Now that led to a situation where onthe market some products had indications, they hadproduct licences of right, and some products werenot allowed to have indications simply because theyhad come along later. The National Rule Schemewhich was permitted under the European Directivewas an attempt to put a boundary around the typesof indication that could be claimed, to simple, self-limiting, minor conditions. It seems that resolves oneof the concerns in public health terms that we have,we do not want homeopathic remedies being o Vered for the treatment of serious disease. Q211 Ian Stewart: What was the public health Committee: Evidence 30 November 2009 Mr Mike O'Brien QC, MP, Professor Kent Woods and Professor David Harper CBE Professor Woods: The public health justication is absolutely empirical and it is that 10 per cent of thepopulation use these products so what are the risksthat that pattern of, if you like, self-determinationmight create? One is that a homeopathic productmight be used where a conventional treatment isnecessary , and therefore if you have, as under theNational Rule Scheme, a system which only allowsfor claims in relation to minor, self-limiting illnesses,you are protecting the patient against thateventuality . It means, when, for instance, as hashappened in the last year or two, we nd on themarket homeopathic remedies with allegedindications for the prevention of malaria, or thetreatment of malignancies, because we have aregulatory control over homeopathic remedies wecan very rapidly see those removed from the market,and that is good for public health. You heard in yourlast evidence session how slow and di Ycult it is to take action when you are doing it throughprofessional regulation, but as we regulate theproducts we can say: \"That is not an acceptablelabelling on your product, it must go now\", and thatis one strong defence for having a regulatory regime. Q212 Ian Stewart: I will come back to regulation later, but we have certainly been told that ahomeopathic proving is not the same as evidence ofeYcacy , so why are homeopathic provings accepted as evidence by the MHRA? Professor Woods: They are not accepted as evidence of eYcacy: they are accepted as evidence that this is a product used by homeopaths within thehomeopathic tradition for that indication. It doesnot mean to say we endorse that indication; it issimply a marker that that product is used within thehomeopathic community for the purpose for whichthe homeopath wishes to use it. Q213 Ian Stewart: Are you making that statement in light of the Minister's statement earlier about whythe Government comes to the decision it does? Professor Woods: This issue about NHS provision and regulation are conceptually di Verent. The question for me is what in public health terms shouldwe be doing to control the availability on the marketwith products. It is a separate question aboutwhether the NHS should be spending money tomake these products available for individual NHSpatients. My concern is about the issue of the publichealth dimensions of allowing them out there. Ian Stewart: I am interested in appropriate but minimum regulation and e Vective research into the eYcacy , and my colleague, Dr Iddon, will press you further on one of those issues. Q214 Dr Iddon: My concern about homeopathic products is that the people who sell them are notrequired to produce any evidence of their e Ycacy in terms of clinical use, yet in another area I am veryinterested in, namely the sale of vitamins, mineralsand herbal products, you are not allowed toadvertise those according to EU regulations now for medical use unless the evidence is available, and I amslightly worried\u2014well, I am more than worried\u2014about that contradiction. Could you, Minister, orone of your colleagues explain the di Verence? Mr O'Brien: There has historically been an encouragement of people to take various vitaminsand, therefore, quite an industry has built up aroundthe taking of various tablets which provide vitamins.If it is the case that something goes on the marketwhich, in theory , has been generally encouraged, andthere is a claim made for it that it has an impact butit simply does not, then in those circumstances we doneed to say you should not be doing that because we have encouraged people to take vitamins. There isnot a government policy of encouraging people totake homeopathic drugs of any kind or medicine ofany kind, and certainly we do not want people to bedeceived. Earlier on we were being asked aboutwhether an individual could ever be prescribed aplacebo and should a Minister intervene in that andI took a view on it, but it certainly is the case that aMinister should take a view on whether, as a whole,there is a wish for the public to be deceived, and theMinister's view is that we do not want that tohappen, certainly in terms of vitamins. In terms ofhomeopathic medicines my view is this: that mostpeople who buy those medicines are aware of thedebate around homeopathy; they may take a viewthat they want to buy it and should they be entitledto it? Yes. Some clinicians take a view thathomeopathy works and they want to prescribe it fortheir patients, should they be able to do that. I do nottake a view particularly that they should do that; Itake a view that a minister should not at this point,given the controversy around it, stop them fromdoing that. Q215 Dr Iddon: But in the public health pilots that are coming, a patient will be able to spend somepublic money on an area of treatment of their choicewhich may well include homeopathic medicine, so ina way indirectly the Government is encouragingpeople to respond to homeopathic medicine, is itnot? Mr O'Brien: Are you talking about personal health budgets? Q216 Dr Iddon: Yes. Mr O'Brien: First of all, there are about 70 pilots, none of them around homeopathy . At some stage inthe future, if these pilots worked and we went aheadwith it, could this happen? It would depend to someextent on two factors. First, there has to be anagreement on the health package with a GP . Let ussay , for the sake of your argument, there was a GPwho believed in homeopathy and, therefore, thoughtthis was the right thing to do. Secondly , there wouldhave to be a PCT who was prepared to fund that.There would have to be the agreement of threeparties, in e Vect: the patient, the doctor (the GP) and the PCT. All would have to agree that that fundingwould be forthcoming for homeopathy . In theory itis possible. Is it going to happen in the next Ev 71 30 November 2009 Mr Mike O'Brien QC, MP, Professor Kent Woods and Professor David Harper CBE years? No. Is it possible it could happen in the long term? Theoretically yes, but you would have to getthe three to agree.Dr Iddon: We will press that point a little further later. Q217 Chairman: You said earlier, Minister, that you did not want to deceive the public.Mr O'Brien: Yes. Q218 Chairman: Presumably you would say same, Professor Woods?Professor Woods: Absolutely . Q219 Chairman: Do in 2005?Professor Woods: Yes. Q220 Chairman: This was the summary of your recommendation following that consultation toGovernment: 32 responses were received from arange of organisations including manufacturers ofhomeopathic products, homeopathic tradeassociations, professional bodies including theRoyal Colleges, patient consumer representatives,organisation of the general public; there waswidespread support for the introduction of nationalrules for the authorisation of homeopathicmedicinal products. That was your comment. Out ofthe 32 responses you got two were not publiclyavailable because of commercial sensitivity; one wasregarding a totally di Verent consultation on herbal medicines; ve were acknowledgements whichsimply said \"No comment\"; three were concernedwith the inclusion of anthroposophic medicines; onewas from the Royal College of Radiologists insupport but they mistook what the consultation wasabout herbal medicine; and of the remaining 20 thatwere concerned with the licensing of homeopathicproducts the members of the public referred to aretwo vets and the editor of a US website who allstrongly objected to the proposals. The BritishV eterinary Association, the Royal College ofGeneral Practitioners, the Royal College ofPhysicians, and the Royal College of Obstetriciansand Gynaecologists all opposed homeopathy , yetyour recommendation to the Minister was there waswidespread support for the introduction of NationalRules, and this goes back to my colleague's questionwhether this is not simply a support for the industryrather than a genuine response to a consultation.Professor Woods: No. As you have heard, views on this are very divided. The advantages of a NationalRule Scheme I would be very happy to talk about,and the consultation reflected, and I have not beenback to it recently , that diversity of views which wehave already talked about. Q221 Chairman: But the vast majority , and these are on public record apart from the two that are ofcommercial sensitivity , virtually to a man and awomen, or an organisation, does not support theview that you gave to the Minister.Professor Woods: But you mentioned to me in the list a number of active homeopathic organisationswhom I am quite sure were supportive of theNational Rule Scheme. Q222 Chairman: Of course they would be. Professor Woods: Of course, but the consultation covered the whole spectrum. Q223 Chairman: It is like saying \"Do jockeys like horse racing?\"Professor Woods: But we had a consultation across all stakeholders and they are included in thestakeholder groups. Q224 Chairman: Do you not nd it a little strange that you seem to have rejected anyone who wasopposed?Professor Woods: I would have to go back to remind myself of the details of the consultation responsesbut I have to say that there has been very littleobjection to the scheme itself. There is discussionabout the concept of regulating homeopathicremedies by any means but, on the other hand, this isan attempt to bring a little more order to an existingenvironment where there was already a market inregulated homeopathic products. Q225 Chairman: Could I ask you, Professor Kent Woods, if you would rst make the consultationpublic, because it has not been made publiclyavailable, and also let this Committee have a note asto why you made that assessment? I think it is unfairof me to pull something out from 2005 and expectyou to keep that in your head.Professor Woods: We will certainly do that. Q226 Dr Harris: Professor Woods, let's take this arnica example since 2006. I think you accepted thatyou do not require any evidence of e Ycacy before allowing a health claim to be made for the indicationfor that product, is that right? Because provings, yousaid, were not an indication of e Ycacy . Professor Woods: They are not in any sense analogous to evidence of e Ycacy . Q227 Dr Harris: So you do not require any evidence of e Ycacy before allowing an indication on that label under this National Rule Scheme?Professor Woods: The descriptor on the packet says, which is agreed with the Regulator: \"A homeopathicmedicinal product used within the homeopathictradition for the symptomatic relief of sprains,muscular aches, bruising and swelling\". That is whatwe wish to conrm and this is used within thehomeopathic tradition for that purpose. It is not thesame as us accepting it as evidence. Q228 Dr Harris: It is helpful to have that on the record. Now, if you could answer my question, youdo not require any evidence of e Ycacy for that to have been agreed to be the wording on the Committee: Evidence 30 November 2009 Mr Mike O'Brien QC, MP, Professor Kent Woods and Professor David Harper CBE Professor Woods: No. Q229 Dr Harris: Do you think that people reading that will think that it works for symptomatic relief ofthose minor conditions, or do you think that labelthat you have read out\u2014and please feel free to readit out again\u2014would make the average person think,which is the truth, as far as you are concerned, thatthere is no evidence of e Ycacy backing it up. Which of those two do you think is most likely , for theaverage person?Professor Woods: Well, fortunately , by law all packaging and patient information leaflets aresubjected to user testing to ensure that they arecomprehensible to the man in the street, and indeedthat seems to be a very straightforward statement ofthe reality . This is a homeopathic medicinal productused within the homeopathic tradition for thesymptomatic relief of sprains, muscular aches andbruising or swelling after contusions. That is what itsays and the user testing is part of the approval ofthat leaflet, has the labelling been tested on theaverage man in the street. Q230 Dr Harris: Sadly my question was not \"What does it say? Has it been tested?\" My question is, andmaybe it is the result of this testing and you need totell me, does the average person think that that labelsuggests that it is going to be useful for thesymptomatic relief of those indications?Professor Woods: I cannot really speak for everybody who reads that -- Q231 Dr Harris: What about the testing you did? What is the result of the testing? Did most peopleread that as saying \"This is not going to work but Imight try it anyway\", or that it might be useful?What?Professor Woods: The testing was that the messages attached to this were clearly understood. Q232 Dr Harris: But what was the understanding, because you cannot tell if they are clearlyunderstood unless you nd out what theunderstanding is, unless we are in a parallel universe?Professor Woods: To begin with the fact that this is a homeopathic remedy , we are making provision fora group of people who believe in homeopathicremedies and, therefore, the rst thing to establish isthat this particular remedy is recognised byhomeopathic practitioners as a homeopathicremedy . That is the essence of what we are trying toprove. We are not trying to make any statementwhatever as to whether it works or not. I would add,however, that there are several other things relatingto the package of information. One is, as you see, theexplicit statement this is homeopathic. Secondly ,there is the requirement on the packaging that if thecondition persists for longer than seven days theyseek a clinician's advice. Q233 Dr Harris: I will come back to that because what it does not say is there is probably no activemolecule if this is beyond 14C dilution active, whichmany of them are, so it does not explain what homeopathy is. So let's work on the assumption thata label that says: \"This is used for the symptomaticrelief\" makes the average person think that it isuseful for the symptomatic relief, and I would put itto you that that is not a huge leap. So do you thinkthe public is helped, and that is your mission, bypatients being led to believe that something is usefulfor a symptom when there is no evidence that it isuseful for a symptom? Is that something that makesyou as a clinician happy , your organisation havingthat e Vect? Professor Woods: You are asking me two questions, one about regulation and one about what Ipersonally believe. I have practised medicine for 30years and I have never deliberately prescribed apatient a placebo, but the point is that there is asignicant group of people who accept and choose tobelieve the homeopathic tradition. If you take asimple example, somebody with a sprain who isgoing to get better from a minor inconvenience canwalk down to their chemist and either buythemselves this product or a bottle of aspirin, andwithin a week the sprain will have got better anyway .Which of those two courses of action is the greaterrisk to their health?Dr Harris: I don't know, but I am not supposed to be answering questions!Chairman: But it was a reasonable response. Q234 Dr Harris: If it was a reasonable response let's come to something more signicant. Let's say , and Ido not think this is unreasonable either, that theMHRA imprimatur on homeopathy helps thecredibility of homeopathy . Do you think there is arisk that people then might go to seek anti-malarialtreatments from homeopaths? Because they do, andyou know that some homeopaths dole outhomeopathic malarial treatment.Professor Woods: There have been instances and, as I said in reply to a previous question, we used thepowers of regulation to take that product o Vthe market immediately . The whole point aboutregulation is it enables us to put in a degree ofprotection for the public which still allows the publicthe personal choice as to whether or not they buyinto homeopathy , but we need to protect them,rstly , from taking a homeopathic remedy when theyneed something for a serious condition; secondly ,from being misinformed as to whether this ishomeopathic or not, and, thirdly , in terms of thequality of manufacture of other products. Q235 Dr Harris: But for them to be protected from being led to believe that it works when there is noevidence that it works is a valuable public healthmessage to get across, all other things being equal.Would that be good?Professor Woods: It is certainly not our intention to do that. Q236 Ian Stewart: I spent probably the last four years or so working with the British Council forAcupuncture and the Traditional Ev 73 30 November 2009 Mr Mike O'Brien QC, MP, Professor Kent Woods and Professor David Harper CBE Association on working on appropriate regulation covering acupuncture. Should homeopathicpractitioners be regulated through a similarstatutory regulatory system? Mr O'Brien: We do not propose at this stage to have statutory regulation. We did fund some work by thePrinces Foundation for Integrated Health through\u00a3900,000 pounds over three years to set up somevoluntary self-regulation. Basically theComplementary and National Healthcare Councilwas set up in 2008; it is still having some discussions,shall we say , with the Society of Homeopaths\u2014ormaybe sometimes not having discussions, because Istill think there is some disagreement there\u2014and thequestion is whether voluntary self-regulation in anarea like this is the better approach. There is to someextent some statutory recognition, of course, ofhomeopathy , which is very limited, but the questionas far as we are concerned is should we undertake alarger scale statutory regulation, and at this point weare not convinced that is the right approach. Q237 Ian Stewart: I was interested by the comments you made about the problem of recognition. Can Ipress you on that? The core of this is whether thereis any perceived harm to patients from homeopathicremedies? Do you know? Mr O'Brien: I think I would defer to Professor Woods on this. Professor Woods: I can identify three potential harms, and I am covering ground I have touched onalready\u2014 Q238 Ian Stewart: Can I stop you there, please? Before we move on to potential harms, and I amhappy to hear those, are there any harms we knowof, rather than potential harms? Professor Woods: As an Agency we are constantly looking for potential harm rather than waiting untilit has happened. You have already drawn attentionto the issue of homeopathics being quiteinappropriately recommended for anti-malarialprophylaxis. That is a real harm. I cannot tell youwhether anybody has died of malaria as aconsequence but I would rather not wait. Q239 Ian Stewart: We did get previous evidence from a practitioner that there were potential harms,so perhaps you could move on to the potentialharms. Professor Woods: I can be very brief. The examples are a homeopathic remedy being used wheresomething is seriously amiss which needs orthodoxtreatment; the risk of a defective product which, bycontamination in manufacture, either chemical orbacterial, harms the patient; and the third comesdown to this question of the patient beingadequately informed that he or she is taking ahomeopathic remedy . Those are the only harms I canperceive. They are not large harms when I considerthat we are interested as an Agency in risk benetrelationships, and the fact that the level of risk isperceived to be very low makes us a little less stringent than we would be in the conventionalsphere in the evidence for e Ycacy . Q240 Dr Iddon: If a patient who had a serious condition believed in their own mind that ahomeopath might be able to help with that conditionand they went to the homeopath, would thehomeopath be adequately trained in all cases to beable to diagnose that more serious condition andrefer the patient to where they should have gone inthe rst place? That is the question we areconcerned about.Professor Woods: I am afraid from the Agency's perspective I cannot answer that because we regulateproducts, not practitioners. Q241 Chairman: But the Minister says we do not need to regulate homeopaths\u2014Mr O'Brien: That is not quite what the Minister said, with respect, Mr Chairman. What the Ministersaid -- Q242 Chairman: You have no plans to do so? Mr O'Brien: No, that was not what I said. What I said was we had no plans to have statutoryregulation. However, we have put in place voluntaryself-regulation because we did think that that formof regulation was necessary . Q243 Dr Harris: I am puzzled by the fact that none of the homeopaths in the Newsnight programme who sold the anti-malarials have, as far as we know,been struck o Vby their voluntary regulators. Mr O'Brien: Maybe because they are not at the moment signed up to the Complementary andNational Healthcare Council. As I indicated inanswer to an earlier question, the Society ofHomeopaths is currently talking or not quite talkingto the CNHC at this point, so striking o Vmay not arise. Whether it arises in relation to the Society ofHomeopaths itself is a matter I cannot answer. Q244 Graham Stringer: How much does the NHS spend on homeopathy?Mr O'Brien: In terms of drugs it is \u00a3152,000 a year which comes from a budget of \u00a311 billion. It isapproximately 0.001 per cent, we calculated, of thedrugs budget. In terms of overall funding it is verydiYcult to know. We have done some work to see if we can nd out what it is. We have four hospitals\u2014one in Glasgow, three in England\u2014which providehomeopathic assistance to people and we do providesome NHS funding for those, so it would run intoseveral million on that basis, so probably less than12\u2014I think I saw that in the Guardian as a quote for the total cost between 2005 and 2008\u2014so probablyless than that but not too much less. Q245 Graham Stringer: Should NHS spending not be dependent on proved e Vectiveness or e Ycacy , whether it is \u00a310,000 or \u00a312 million?Mr O'Brien: You are asking two slightly di Verent questions: one concerns e Vectiveness and the other eYcacy . It is arguable that Committee: Evidence 30 November 2009 Mr Mike O'Brien QC, MP, Professor Kent Woods and Professor David Harper CBE clinician and the patient, genuinely believe that homeopathy works, and it happens to but maybenot in the e Ycacious way they believe, then is that something that the NHS should stop spendingmoney on? That is essentially your question. Myanswer is that at this point I have not got theevidence to do that, and I would not seek to do that.At the same time if you are asking me a slightlyseparate question, and it is a distinction I madeearlier to Evan Harris, which is would I advocatethat we should, if we were not now doing it, spendthat money , then I would probably be looking forsome more evidence, but we are at the moment in aposition where we are spending this money; there isa considerable lobby which does believe it works;they are not stupid people; many of them are veryable, very capable people who have done quite a lotof work in this area; and they do believe that itworks. Now, there may not be the empirical evidenceat the moment for that, but should we stop thatspending? Not at this point. Q246 Graham Stringer: That is a curious answer, if you do not mind me saying so. We are covering someof the ground we went through before about placeboand e Ycacy and you are saying essentially that we do not have the evidence but we do have a tough lobbyon this issue, therefore\u2014Mr O'Brien: No, I am not quite saying that, because I was distinguishing between e Ycacy and eVectiveness. If it is the case that some people believe they are better as a result of being involved inhomeopathy and should we then stop that funding,that is not evidence of e Ycacy . Is it evidence of eVectiveness? Well, people are feeling better. Q247 Graham Stringer: But it is indistinguishable from the placebo e Vect. The long discussion we had before established that fact, that the placebo e Vect exists and that --Mr O'Brien: It depends what you mean. We can get into exactly what the placebo e Vect is -- Q248 Graham Stringer: I understood the discussion both at the last evidence session and today to be thatthere was no evidence over and above the placeboeVect, and I understood your answer to be agreeing with that but saying that there is a large lobby ofintelligent people and therefore we will continuespending, and I do nd that a curious answer.Mr O'Brien: That is not the argument I am putting; it is only part of the argument I am putting. What Icertainly do say is this: that there is a signicantlobby of people who are clinicians who are quitecapable of looking at data and who take a view thatthis works, and to say , therefore, that we should stopfunding because other clinicians, the majority , take aview that it does not work at all, and to say we aregoing with the vast majority of the scienticcommunity who take a di Verent view is a stance I have real problems with. I think there is anilliberality in saying that personal choice in an areaof signicant medical controversy should becompletely denied, and I think the Governmentshould be cautious about constraining thatilliberality , or interfering with it. We should not take the view that patients should not be able to havehomeopathic medicine when they want it. There aresome clinicians who take the view that it works. Q249 Graham Stringer: Can I make one point and ask a question, because we could go round andround this for quite a long time. If that argument wasapplied to climate change and you used thearguments of what appeared to be the minority ofscientic opinion that climate change was nothappening, you would come to a very di Verent Government response than you appear to be comingto on this. The real point is that you do have moreevidence than you are owning up to at the moment,because West Kent PCT looked thoroughly at theeVectiveness and e Ycacy of the homeopathic hospital in West Kent and we had the person herewho carried out that survey who said, in words ofone syllable: \"This is a waste of public money\". So ifWest Kent believes that spending that money is awaste of public money , why is it di Verent in Liverpool or Gloucester or wherever else thesehospitals are? Mr O'Brien: As far as that study is concerned that was an examination of a particular clinicalexperience and the person who did it was entitled toreach the conclusion they did. There are others whotake a di Verent view. They may not have done any substantial empirical peer reference study that willenable us to say: \"This works\", but the question forme as a Minister is not so much the one you areputting to me, in a sense, which is fairly reasonable,but is there a justication for stopping spending inrelation to homeopathy now, and my judgment isthere is not that amount of evidence to justify mestopping spending on homeopathy . If you are askingm ead i Verent question which is whether I can justify all the spending on homeopathy today the answerwould probably be \"No\" too, but that spending isthere and a signicant group of people believe itworks, and therefore my view is that it would beilliberal and a denial of personal choice, becausethere is a signicant \"scientic\" community behindit who take a view that it should be allowed tocontinue. At this point as a Minister I am taking theview that we are prepared to allow this spending tooccur, we are not going to interfere in it, and it is alocal judgment. We wrote around to the PCTs, and Ithink you may have seen the responses. 88 PCTstook the view that they would not routinely prescribehomeopathy , 26 did so in exceptional cases, 31 doprovide it, and seven in London did not respond, sothere are di Verent views in the NHS among people who are quite reputable as to whether they shouldfund this. Q250 Graham Stringer: I will move on but I do nd it an extraordinary liberal view that we have a studywithin the NHS which shows it is not e Vective -- Mr O'Brien: I think, with the greatest respect, Graham, that it is extraordinary indeed. I amexpressing the liberal view and Evan Harris Ev 75 30 November 2009 Mr Mike O'Brien QC, MP, Professor Kent Woods and Professor David Harper CBE Dr Harris: Evan Harris is not expressing anything! Q251 Graham Stringer: Do you think we could get out of this di Yculty with di Verent parts of the NHS spending public money on quite di Verent criteria by getting homeopathic treatments evaluated byNICE? Mr O'Brien: I have no objection to NICE evaluating this but they do have a couple of problems with it.Firstly , they have a large queue of drugs that theyneed to evaluate and there are greater priorities.Secondly , there is a somewhat limited evidential baseand before evaluating things NICE want to see anevidential base, and for the reasons we have alreadydiscussed it simply is not there at the moment. Theycould decide to spend a lot of public money\u2014probably with great objection from some people onthis Committee\u2014establishing that evidential base,but that is not a priority for them or us at themoment. Q252 Graham Stringer: Have you asked them to look at it, or asked them not to look at it? Mr O'Brien: I understand there have been some discussions with them as to whether they would doit, but for the reasons I have described they havetaken the view that, although they have no objectionto doing it if we ask them to and the evidence base isthere, at this point they do not feel it is a priority forthem, and I would endorse that view. It is not apriority . Q253 Graham Stringer: Politics is a practical business; we are in the same party and we want to getelected. How important is the size of thehomeopathic lobby in a Vecting your decisions on not asking NICE to evaluate it and having di Verent policies in di Verent parts of the NHS? Mr O'Brien: I am not sure there are any votes in it one way or the other. Q254 Dr Harris: If the Chairman of NICE asked you if he could do an evaluation, would you have anyobjection? Supplementary memorandum submitted by the Department of Health (HO 34a) Letter from Rt Hon Mike O'Brien QC MP, Minister of State for Health Services, to the Chairman of the Committee, 16 December 2009 I refer to your letter dated 2 December 2009 in which you asked for a note on a supplementary question\u2014 \"To what extent does the support of the Royal Family for homeopathy influence the Department's policyto continue to support homeopathic services? More specically , have members of the Royal Family made representations to the Department in respect of homeopathy?\" The Department does not maintain a position on any complementary or alternative treatments, including homeopathic services, leaving decisions on their use by the National Health Service, to the NationalHealth Service. The Department engages with a wide range of stakeholders when formulating policy . We consider all such views on their merits.Mr O'Brien: I cannot imagine this would happen and I think I probably would object, actually . Iwould probably say , \"Is that the best you can thinkof to do at the moment given the queue of drugs weare asking you to deal with very quickly?\" I think theanswer is I would have an objection but it would bea practical and not an ethical one. Q255 Dr Harris: Professor Harper, you said earlier that you thought there was an evidence base onRCTs, meta-analyses and systematic reviews tounderpin a decision about whether NICE iseYcacious, therefore e Vective beyond placebo, and therefore cost e Vective because you can cost it. How, therefore, do you respond to the assertion that thereis not a testable evidence base, which is what theMinister said just now or before, to judge whetherthe spending of this money , in itself, on the basis ofeVectiveness and cost e Vectiveness, is a valid question to test, because that would suggest we needmore research of the RCT type, which you thoughtwe did not earlier?Professor Harper: What I tried to flag up earlier is that there is an evidence base but it is subject todiVerent interpretation, and that is at the crux of the challenge we face on this. It is a very di Ycult evidence base to test, so there have been quite anumber of randomised controlled. Whilst I am not ahomeopathic practitioner, homeopathicpractitioners would argue that the way randomisedcontrolled trials are set up they do not lendthemselves necessarily to the evaluation anddemonstration of e Ycacy of homeopathic remedies, so to go down the track of having more randomisedcontrolled trials, for the time being at least, does notseem to be a sensible way forward. Q256 Ian Stewart: We have evidence that there was nothing more than a placebo e Vect involved here, but other evidence to say there was more than aplacebo e Vect. In those circumstances and in light of the answer you just gave Evan, why would you notput more money into research?Mr O'Brien: Because there are other priorities. Chairman: I am going to close the session at this point, so can I thank you all very much indeed forcoming this afternoon, and for the Technology Committee: Evidence Ministers have sometimes had contact with members of the Royal Family . For example, the Secretary of State occasionally has meetings with members of the Royal Family the most recent of which was with HRHPrince Charles on 29 October 2009. These are private meetings, have no xed agenda and cover a wide rangeof topics of interest to both parties, which may sometimes include homeopathy .I hope that this is helpful.

As you are aware, homeopathic products authorised under the National Rules Scheme must be labelled in accordance with Articles 54 and 68 of Directive 2001/83 EC as amended. The package leaflet must complywith Article 59 of the Directive and be user tested to ensure that the information is legible, clear and easyto use. However if all of the information required under Article 59 is stated clearly on the label, then apackage leaflet may not be included. I would also draw your attention to the European Commission guideline on the readability of the labelling and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use (12 Jan 2009). This can be found athttp://www.emea.europa.eu/htms/human/qrd/qrdguide.htm In the case of Arnica 30C pillules, all of the information required under Article 59 of the Directive could be clearly stated on the label and therefore a separate package leaflet was not required. Three rounds of user testings were carried out with 10 participants in each testing. Twelve questions relating to the key safety messages were asked and were designed to assess whether the respondent was ableto nd the information, understand it and use the information. The questions asked were as follows: 1. Can you tell me the name of this medicine?2. What does the label say that this medicine is for?3. If you take too much of this product (overdose) what does the label tell you to do?4. Is there any advice on the label for women who are pregnant or breast feeding?5. What does the label say is the active ingredient in this medicine?6. If you have missed a dose of this medicine, what does the label tell you to do?7. Once you have opened your medicine, how does the leaflet tell you that you should store it?8. This medicine contains Arnica Montana 30C. What are the other ingredients in this medicine?9. How many pillules are there in the Clikpak container? 10. This medicine contains lactose and sucrose which are types of sugar. If you have an intolerance to some sugars, what does the pack tell you to do before taking this product? 11. How many pillules does the pack say that you should take in a dose and how many times a day should you take them? 12. The pillules in this medicine are contained in a plastic Clikpak to help protect them. What instructions does the label give you as to how to dispense the pillules from the Clikpak? Participants' answers were provided and the ease with which the information was located was graded as very easily; easily; little di Yculty or lots of di Yculty . Assessment of understanding the information was graded as yes or no. Some issues raised with the early user tests have been satisfactorily addressed in thesubsequent user test. Participants were also asked to comment on the layout and design of the label and theresponse was positive, indicating that the label was well structured and easy to read. Overall and on eachoccasion, a satisfactory test outcome was achieved meeting the success criteria ie 90% of participants wereable to nd the information requested, of whom 90% could show that they understood the information byproviding the correct answer and it was concluded that no further user testing was required.

Derek Watson BDS LDS RCS DGDP Chief Executive O Ycer November 2009 Memorandum submitted by Professor David Colquhoun (HO 02) 1.Government policy on licensing of homeopathic products 1.1 By their own admission, the government has simply ignored the evidence. The Government's responses to the Committee's questions(http://www.parliament.uk/documents/upload/091021 Final Evidence Check response.pdf ) said: \"Thirdly, no scientic evidence was examined in drawing up the National Rules Scheme,\" This is a quite astonishing admission for a government that claims to base policies on the best scientic advice. The same document asserts: \"Homeopathy has a long tradition in Europe and is a recognised system of medicine across the EU\". It is most certainly not a \"recognised system of medicine\" for anyone with the most rudimentary scientic education. Quite on the contrary. Throughout my life time homeopathy has been a sort of bad joke. Indeedit has been a joke ever since Oliver Wendell Holmes famous essay \"Homeopathy and Its KindredDelusions\", written in 1842. 1.2 It is however, a joke in poor taste. Homeopaths endanger the lives of patients when they try to treat serious conditions like malaria and AIDS, which they routinely do. The government must be aware that twohomeopaths in Australia were charged with manslaughter and sentenced to six and four years in prison,when their own daughter died for lack of proper treatment. It is only a matter of time before the same thinghappens here. If and when it does, the Department of Health will bear some of the blame because of itsshameful disregard for evidence. 1.3 For some reason that I have never been able to discover, the MHRA was pushed in 2006 into allowing highly misleading labelling of homeopathic products. It should be investigated whether the new labelling islegal under the Consumer Protection Unfair Trading Regulations of May 2008. These regulations state, interalia, that \"One of the 31 commercial practices which are in all circumstances considered unfair is \"falsely claiming that a product is able to cure illnesses, dysfunction or malformations\" Such claims are, of course, rife in the homeopathic industry and in my opinion the labelling that has been allowed by the MHRA is illegal because the regulations refer to the way labels will be interpreted by the\"average consumer\". I do not believe that the average consumer will interpret the words \"traditionally usedfor the treatment of\" as a synonym for \"ine Vective in the treatment of\", though Technology Committee: Evidence 1.4 It is nothing short of surreal that the MHRA should have a committee to earnestly consider whether pills, which mostly contain nothing whatsoever, are safe and manufactured properly(http://careers.bmj.com/careers/view-job.html?id %20018826). This sort of absurdity makes a mockery of any claim that the government is interested in evidence. It is surely the ultimate example of the precedenceof mindless process and procedure over common sense. Pure comedy. 2.Government policy on the funding of homeopathy through the NHS 2.1 At present the government (disgracefully) has no policy on this. Every time the government is asked about it, no answer has been forthcoming. The question is merely referred to PCTs. The Department ofHealth (DH) has consistently evaded its responsibility to assess the evidence and it should now live up tothat responsibility. Many PCTs have stopped, or greatly reduced their funding for homeopathy. Onehomeopathic hospital has shut altogether, and funding for homeopathy at the Royal London HomeopathicHospital has been greatly reduced. But there is no consistency in policy whatsoever, because the DH hasoVered no direction and has ignored scientic advice. 2.2 To allow sugar pills to be paid for by the NHS is an absurdity. If it is not su Yciently absurd for the DH to take action itself then they should refer homeopathy as a whole to NICE, just as any other proposedtreatment would be (and it must be made sure that NICE does the evaluation properly, and not appoint alot of homeopaths to do the evaluation). This was recommended in the House of Lords report (2000). It wasrecommended again in the Smallwood report (sponsored by the Prince of Wales). It is beyondcomprehension that DH has still not done it. 2.3 If it is thought that a placebo is something worth having available (a highly contentious idea) then it should be done honestly. The present practice combines the worst of both worlds. Doctors are not allowedto prescribe an honest placebo, even if they think that is the best they can do for the patient. But they areallowed to prescribe a dishonest placebo by referring the patient to a homeopath. 3. The evidence base on homeopathic products and services. 3.1 I see no point in my going through the evidence yet again. It has all been done very well in, for example, Singh & Ernst's book, Trick or Treatment . There is clearly no convincing evidence that it works. In addition, the prior odds of a pill that contains no active ingredient having an e Vect is so small that enormously strong evidence would be needed to persuade one that it worked. After 150 years thehomeopaths have still failed to produce any remotely convincing evidence. 3.2 The homeopaths who submit responses to this committee will, as always, pick out the few small and badly designed trials that appear to support their cause. Their approach to evidence is, in my view, nothingshort of dishonest. I can only presume that one of the reasons for this is that they have the ultimate vestedinterest insofar as they would lose their livelihoods if they were to admit that there was no worthwhileevidence for the e Ycacy of their pills. 3.3 If homeopathy worked the whole of chemistry and physics would have to be overturned. The idea is quite simply preposterous. It is a waste of time and money to look for evidence if you aren't, at the sametime, willing to abandon chemistry and physics. To pretend otherwise is simple duplicitous double-think. Itis time that the government decided whether or not it believes in Avogadro's number or not. Government policy at the moment is based on the absurd proposition that Avogadro's number is right if you are talkingabout chemistry but wrong if you are talking about homeopathy. 4.Declaration of interests I am a pharmacologist. My research has been funded entirely by the MRC and the Wellcome Trust, never by the pharmaceutical industry. I have nancial interests in neither the pharmaceutical industry nor thealternative medicine industry. I do have a strong interest in the quality of evidence and in how to distinguishwhat works from what doesn't. I have written a textbook of statistics ( Lectures on Biostatistics , Clarendon Press Oxford, 1970) and so have knowledge of that eld and particular its application to clinical trials oftreatments. (You will, no doubt, be aware that many of those who write to you to advocate homeopathy make their living from it.) David Colquhoun FRS Professor of PharmacologyUniversity 93 Memorandum submitted by John Boulderstone (HO 03) This submission refers to Government policy on Licensing Homeopathic Products and the Evidence base on homeopathic products and services. 1. As you are aware there is a lot of controversy on the internet and in the press about homeopathy. A vast amount of the problems come from people who think they understand what homeopathy is but havenot checked with the original source. It is important that the Science and Technology Committee have anunderstanding of what homeopathy is and not get their understanding from ill-informed journalists,websites or \"quack-busters\" who distort the denition of homeopathy for their own purposes. In short ascientic (meaning accurate) denition is needed. 2. Initially, I would like to point out what homeopathy is not. Homeopathy is not the prescription of diluted substances. The proof of this, if any is needed, lies in the fact that initially Samuel Hahnemannadministered homeopathic substances that were not diluted and still called what he did homeopathy. In facthe gave the same medicines as the orthodox medical practitioners of the time. What made, and makes,medicines homeopathic is ONLY the philosophy by which they are prescribed and NOT that they arediluted. 3. Some journalists, comedians and the \"quack-busters\" choose to not understand this fact about homeopathy because it is then easy to make jokes about it. 4. The misunderstanding of what homeopathy is runs very deep and some people who call themselves homeopaths have also forgotten what homeopathy is. 5. Homeopathy is badly dened on websites and in newspapers. It is denitively dened by its founder Samuel Hahnemann in his \"Organon of Medicine\". However, this book is di Ycult to read which is why there is so much misinformation. It is not dened well by Wikipedia. 6. Also, most, if not all, scientic trials test for the e Ycacy of potentised substances and these tests do not test homeopathy. Even so, very often the scientists conducting these trials believe they are testinghomeopathy. 7. What is currently used as an explanation is the phrase \"like cures like\". While this is a succinct explanation and useful for homeopaths, it allows non-homeopaths to believe the prescribed remedy doesthe work and not the reaction from the patient. This then leads to the inevitable focus on the remedy andits \"strength\" instead of the way the remedy is selected. The phrase \"like cures like\" misleads. 8. A better explanation comes in two parts. Two parts are needed to emphasise an important point that is missed in other explanations. The rst is: Homeopathy is a prescription that causes a reaction in the patient ; A remedy becomes homeopathic only when it matches the symptoms of the patient so it is the act ofprescribing that makes it homeopathy. Notice that there is no mention of dilutions because this is not arequirement for homeopathy. The second part is: this reaction cures the patient . 9. Reiterating the explanation: Homeopathy is a prescription that causes a reaction in the patient; this reaction cures the patient. 10. Allopathy may be explained in a similar way as: A prescription that removes the problem. Usually using an anti-drug (antibiotics, anti-depressants, anti-inflammatories, anti-virals), taking little account ofthe di Verences in di Verent patients. This explanation could be accepted by both homeopaths and allopaths. And now the di Verence between the two therapies can be clearly seen. 11. Therefore, the term \"homeopathic products\", used to describe potentised material is misnamed. Products used by homeopaths vary in strength from highly dilute to NOT DILUTE AT ALL, they can alsobe orthodox medicines if they are prescribed in the correct way. Remember, it is not the substance or itsmethod of manufacture that makes it homeopathic but the reason for prescribing. 12. So, to be accurate, scientic and not misleading the term \"homeopathic products\" cannot be used before the products are prescribed. To do so misunderstands what homeopathy actually is. Instead, theappropriate term may be \"potentised substances\". If this distinction between \"homeopathic products\" and\"potentised substances\" is not made a nonsense will result when looking at the evidence base and licensingof products. John Boulderstone Declaration of interests: I am a homeopath that does not prescribe Evidence Memorandum submitted by Dr Lionel R Milgrom (HO 04) 1. Introduction 1.1. The main purpose of this response is not so much to provide an exhaustive account of the evidence for homeopathy\u2014this will be provided by others\u2014but to question what in calling for a \"second evidencecheck\", the S&TC means by \"evidence\", and evidence for homeopathy compared to what? 1.2. As Prof Harald Walach (University of Northampton) has pointed out, [1]the problem here revolves around the widely-held assertion, currently circulated by \"sceptics\" (more properly, \"detractors\": the term\"sceptic\" should be reserved for those who have yet to make up their minds) that homeopathy/CAMs (CAM%complementary and alternative medicine) are not evidence-based, while conventional medicine by and large is. Prof Walach, [1]myself,[2,3]and others,[4]have e Vectively deconstructed this assertion. 1.3. Further, it is my intention to question the term \"evidence-based\" and that applying it to conventional medicine is also di Ycult. In so doing, I hope to level the \"evidence-based\" playing eld that has been tilted against homeopathy. 1.4. My chief concerns, however, relate to the motivation and objectivity of the Science and Technology Committee given the current campaign that is being waged against homeopathy and other CAM therapiesin the UK by various high prole detractors in the media, [2,3]and certain organisations.[5] 1.5. Their explicit intention is to pressurise the NHS and PCTs into terminating their commitment to fund and provide homeopathy/CAM services. 1.6. This is being perpetrated regardless of the wishes of a large segment of the UK population who by choice avail themselves of these services, and that a minuscule amount of the NHS budget is currently spenton homeopathy. 1.7. Thus, though perhaps not considered part of its remit, the meaning of the term \"evidence-based\" is something the Science and Technology Committee might usefully wish to consider. 2. E vidence -Based Medicine (EBM)? 2.1. As rst formulated, EBM was: \"an approach to health care that promotes the collection, interpretation, and integration of... patient- reported, clinician-observed, and research-derived evidence. The best available evidence, moderatedby patient circumstances and preferences, is applied to improve the quality of clinical judgments. \" [6] 2.2. Thus, the double-blind randomised placebo-controlled trial (DBRCT) was meant originally as part of an evidence \"package\" derived from multiple sources. David Sackett, one of EBM's founders,emphasized this in 1992: \"Evidence-based medicine is not restricted to randomised trials and meta-analyses. It involves tracking down the best external evidence with which to answer our clinical questions. ... If norandomised trial has been carried out for our patient's predicament, we follow the trail to the nextbest external evidence and work from there. \" [7] 2.3. EBM as currently practiced, now concentrates solely on the \"gold-standard\" double-blind randomized-controlled trial (DBRCT) and meta-analyses as the only acceptable scientic evidence for atherapy or procedure. [8] 2.4. Supposedly, this enables purely objective clinical decisions to be taken: other forms of evidence Sackett referred to as essential parts of the decision-making process, have been e Vectively downgraded or ignored. EBM's original intentions therefore, have been subsumed by over-emphasis on medicine's scienceto the exclusion of its art. [9,10] 2.5. Complex procedures (where it is virtually impossible to separate the therapy from the context in which it is delivered eg, CBT, homeopathy, etc) do not readily lend themselves to the DBRCT\u2014itself,implicitly flawed [11-14]\u2014and are seemingly left out in the cold. 2.6. This much narrower interpretation of EBM has elicited trenchant responses, even from within conventional medicine,[15-17]but in particular for its intolerance of therapeutic pluralism.[4] 2.7. The change in EBM's emphasis equates with rapid increases in our biochemical understanding of life, health, and disease, combined with globalization of the pharmaceutical industry's commercial andpolitical reach. From this has arisen a desire to place medicine on a similar intellectual footing as othersciences. 2.8. Its concomitant is a resurgence of logical positivism 1as an accessible (media-friendly) interpretation of science, and ultimately to justication of the globalised pharmaceutical industry's attemptsto monopolize the health care market. 1Logical positivism is a school of philosophy that combines empiricism (the idea that observational evidence is indispensable for knowledge of the world), with a version of rationalism incorporating mathematical and logico-linguistic constructs anddeductions in epistemology. It was the dominant philosophy of science between the First World War and the Cold War, andhas been criticised by among others, Popper, Ayer, Ev 95 2.9. Though out-dated[18-28]within the physical sciences (especially quantum physics), logical positivism goes unchallenged, especially in public arenas (eg, the media and in political debates about science), and stillholds sway in biomedicine. 2.10. Logical positivism e Vectively dominates the discourse of EBM, resulting not only in a downgrading and/or ignoring of other valid forms of evidence; it now means the medical research community potentiallyhas saddled funding agencies and taxpayers with a huge and expensive problem: that of subjecting all medical procedures and therapies to the DBRCT, so they can be judged t for clinical use. 2.11. This will not be easy because: \"Of around 2,500 treatments covered, 13% are rated as benecial, 23% likely to be benecial, 8% as trade o benets and harms, 6% unlikely to be benecial, 4% likely to be ine Vective or harmful, and 46%, the largest proportion, as of unknown e Vectiveness. ... The gures above suggest that the research community has a large task ahead and that most decisions about treatments still reston the individual judgements of clinicians and patients. \" [29] 2.12. Therefore, the charge often levelled at homeopathy that it is \"unscientic\" rings hollow when compared to this clear lack of evidence for many conventional medical treatments and procedures. 2.13. Thus, if the challenge against homeopathy raised by EBM is to be at all taken seriously then, by default, it has to be applied with equal rigour to conventional therapies, which will mean that roughly halfof all procedures, including nearly all surgical ones, will have to be banned. 3. EBM andConventional Medicine 3.1. Such a procedure is set to become a double-edged sword for biomedicine, as the following example shows. Thus trials of one of the world's biggest selling drugs Prozac, recently found it to be no better thanplacebo. [30] 3.2. Interestingly, homeopathy/CAM detractors are not campaigning for the removal of Prozac, as they do so vociferously against homeopathy/CAM (even when Prozac and Prozac-like drugs have been knownto induce suicidal tendencies). Fortunately, such scientistic 2\"fundamentalism\"[2]is not shared by all in medicine. 3.3. Thus, cancer clinician Karol Sikora (60% of whose patients use some form of CAM as adjuvant therapies) has uncompromisingly castigated the more vociferous homeopathy/CAM detractors as\"inexperienced armchair physicians\", while berating their \"Stalinist\" attempts to rid the NHS of its CAMservices. [31] 3.4. Sir Michael Rawlins (Chair of NICE and no supporter of homeopathy/CAM) in his Harveian Oration last year,[15]warned: \"RCTs, long regarded as the 'gold standard' of evidence, have been put on an undeserved pedestal. Their appearance at the top of hierarchies of evidence is inappropriate; and hierarchies are illusorytools for assessing evidence. They should be replaced by a diversity of approaches that involveanalysing the totality of the evidence base. \" 3.5. In this respect, Sir Michael Rawlins simply echoes David Sackett's much earlier concern that EBM would turn into an evidence \"mono-culture\", where the primacy of an assumed \"ideal\" scientically-determined e Ycacy would subsume other no less important forms of patient and clinician derived evidence. [7] 3.6. That over a decade later, voices in the nursing profession have been raised concerning EBM's intolerance of therapeutic pluralism in healthcare systems,[4]suggests Sackett's early warning went completely unheeded. This scientistic version of EBM throws up for itself several alarming contradictions. 3.8. Thus, in a recent German randomised controlled back-pain study, acupuncture \"placebo\" was shown to be nearly twice as e Vective as the best conventional medicine has to o Ver. So, according to the principles of EBM as currently practiced, conventional medicine is less e Vective than an acupuncture placebo.[19] 3.9. The H1N1 swine flu vaccine is being rushed into production and distribution with little evidence from trials of its e Vectiveness or safety in humans. 3.10. One of the most frequently quoted studies (by the sceptical literature and the media), supposedly demonstrating homeopathy is no better than placebo, is a 2005 Lancet meta-analysis,[32]which has been shown by leading researchers to be thoroughly biased,33-36] 3.11. In addition, two recent studies have concluded this meta-analysis was also a scientically seriously flawed piece of work,[37,38]which broke the Lancet 's own strict guidelines on methodological and publication transparency.[39] 3.12. The question arises therefore as to why it was ever allowed to appear in such an eminent journal as the Lancet in the rst place. This leads onto the whole thorny issue of abuse of science in medical and pharmacological research,[40]reported recently in the magazine Prospect.[41] 2Scientism describes the view that natural science is superior to all other interpretations of life, such as philosophical, religious, mythical, spiritual, or humanistic explanations, and over other elds of inquiry, such as Committee: Evidence 3.13. In 2008, the journal Nature , stated that \"in the US around 1,000 incidents of suspected fabrication, falsication, and plagiarism go unreported every year\" .[42] In the UK, the Committee on Publication Ethics estimates that there are about 50 cases per year of serious fraud in biomedical research, and that academia has been trying to cover up this abuse of science. 3.14. The Prospect article concludes, \"We may have to wait for fresh scandals before anyone acts. Until then, patients will remain in real danger of taking expensive drugs whose risk of harm or inability to cure, have been fraudulentlysuppressed.\" And there is clear evidence of harm perpetrated by conventional medical practice. 3.15. The House of Commons Public Accounts Committee concluded that in 2006 alone, at least 2.68 million people in Britain were harmed by conventional medical interventions: a staggering 4.5% of theUK population. [43]In the US, the situation is even worse.[44] 3.16. When no such evidence of fraud or large-scale danger of homeopathy in clinical practice have been reported, one wonders why so much energy is expended trying to demonise homeopathy/CAMs and thosewho practice them, as \"unproven, unscientic, deadly and dangerous\". 4. E vidence for Homeopathy 4.1. There are many scientic trials and meta-analyses providing evidence that the e Vects of homeopathy are more than a placebo response. These are summarised on the Faculty of Homeopathy website. [45] 4.2. If the more inclusive Rawlins and Sackett denitions of evidence are utilised however, then it is clear that there is growing evidence from clinical observation studies[46,47]for the positive health benets of homeopathy, and its cost e Vectiveness.[48-50] 4.3. There is also mounting basic science evidence that homeopathically prepared solutions may very well diVer from those that are simply diluted, suggesting the operation of a \"water-memory\" e Vect that surely deserves further exploration.[51-54] 4.4. In addition, laboratory studies suggest that even very high homeopathic dilutions (beyond Avogadro's number) may exert biological e Vects, though even high quality studies have yet to achieve consistency in experimental methodology.[55-58] 4.5. Some intriguing results which have just been published demonstrate that extremely low doses of cytokines achieve relief from the symptoms of allergic asthma induced in experimental mice, but only whenthe cytokines have been serially diluted and violently agitated in the homeopathic manner. [59] 5. AnAside:Is the \"Memory of Water\"( M oW) P ossible ? 5.1. As someone who originally came into homeopathy with over 30 years experience in chemistry (BSc, MSc, PhD, CChem, FRSC), MoW as a possible mechanism for how homeopathic remedies might produceeVects (even when the original substance has been diluted out of existence), has produced in me feelings ranging from outrage to intrigue. 5.2. Consequently, I can sympathise with those for whom MoW [60]seems to contravene \"common sense\" and fundamental scientic principles, such as the Laws of Thermodynamics. 5.3. The problem with understanding MoW is the prevalence of so-called \"common sense\", which ultimately is only an indication of a particular paradigm's power over peoples' imaginations. Newexperiences, repeated often enough make prevailing paradigms redundant. [61] 5.4. Not so long ago, the idea that the world was flat was \"common sense.\" So, one's experience and common sense are just as likely to be shaped by one's beliefs, as the other way around, and are notfundamental. 5.5. MoW describes the apparent ability of bulk water to be \"imprinted\" with the \"signature\" of a substance once dissolved, but now diluted and violently agitated out of existence . The agitation is absolutely necessary, as mere dilution on its own does not reproduce this phenomenon. The term was rst coined byProf Jacques Benveniste, and in his controversial Nature paper, he clearly distinguishes between mere dilution and dilution plus agitation. [62,63] 5.6. In chemical terms, MoW might be considered a supra-molecular phenomenon involving trillions of water molecules. Thus, it is an emergent dynamic property of bulk liquid water (ie, the whole is more than the sum of its individual molecular parts) and, as such, dees simple explanation in terms of conventionalchemical ideas of static bonding and additive behaviour of individual water molecules. 5.7. Certainly, water molecules' ability to dynamically switch hydrogen bonding to each other is of crucial importance here, as are other weak intermolecular interactions (eg, van de Waals forces). Prof MartinChaplin gives a fulsome account of this behaviour on his Evidence Ev 97 5.8. The point is, the principles of equilibrium thermodynamics that one learns at school and university cannot explain this behaviour, because it involves so-called critical or instability points very far from chemical equilibrium. It is a type of behaviour rst described by Prof Ilya Prigogine's Nobel Prize-winning work on the thermodynamics of non-equilibrium chemical reactions very close to chaos, such as those that necessarily occur in all living organisms .[65] 5.9. One plausible hypothesis is that such instability points act as local dynamic attractors of the system. These necessarily exist in such microscopic form, it requires a novel quantum description that predicts e Vects at the macroscopic level, with consequences not dissimilar to those of superconductors and super-fluids inlow-temperature physics. The model is applicable to several systems of complementary medicine, includinghomeopathy. [66] 5.10. This means that it is quite possible for the physical and chemical properties of a solution to depend on its dilution history: in other words, for it to have a \"memory\" of what has been diluted in it. A series ofinteresting experiments indicating this possibility, was reported recently using solutions of di Verent substances at various (non-homeopathic) dilutions. [67] 5.11. Sixteen years after Benveniste's controversial work, a successful version of his experiments was performed involving a multi-centre European trial over ve years, in ve separate laboratories.[56] 5.12. In a completely di Verent area, Rey obtained thermoluminescence data from homeopathically prepared ultrahigh dilutions of lithium and sodium chloride, which were reproducibly di Verent from pure water diluted with itself.[51]This suggests that the dynamically-altering pattern of hydrogen bonds described in 5.7., might survive removal of the original material. 5.13. The eld of materials science has demonstrated that it is changes to the structure of water rather than its composition that fundamentally a Vects its properties.[68]In this regard, water can adopt a range of dynamic structures which have been used to account for its many well-known anomalies as a liquid.[64] 5.14. There is also compelling thermodynamic evidence that extremely diluted solutions prepared in the homeopathic manner, by sequential dilution and violent agitation, are measurably and reproduciblydiVerent from similar solutions that have simply been diluted. [53] 5.15. Dr Cyril Smith in the UK has for over 30 years researched how living things make use of electro- magnetic elds and frequencies, and their connection with MoW.[69] 5.15. All the above experimental work supports a theoretical mechanism for MoW rst put forward by Italian physicists Profs Del Guidice and Preparata over 20 years ago,[70]that the homeopathic process of serial dilution and violent agitation triggers formation of dynamic \"structures\" in water that can surviveremoval of all traces of the original dissolved substance. 5.16. Contrary to what some homeopathy/CAM detractors think therefore, MoW is not only possible, it does NOT contravene known scientic laws and principles. 6. C onclusions 6.1. The charge often levelled at homeopathy by is detractors, that it is \"unscientic\" even \"deadly\" does not withstand close scrutiny when compared to the clear lack of evidence for many conventional medicaltreatments and procedures, including some of the latest vaccines, and the clear evidence of harm throughside-e Vects of some conventional interventions. 6.2. With its increasing reliance solely on the results of randomised-controlled trials, Evidence-based Medicine as currently understood and practiced is no longer a reliable or cost-e Vective \"tool\" for investigating the e Ycacy or safety of many conventional medical procedures, let alone homeopathy/CAMs. 6.3. There is clear evidence of bias and dependence on flawed science by some assessing and reporting the supposed lack of e Ycacy of homeopathy, while at the same time, abuse of science and its cover-up are unfortunately not rare occurrences in medical and pharmaceutical research. 6.4. From RCTs, meta-analyses, clinical observational studies, and basic science experiments, there exists a steadily growing evidence base for homeopathy, the e Ycacy of some of its remedies, and their possible mode of action. Work is also beginning to elaborate homeopathy's cost-e Vectiveness 6.5. Finally, I would bring to the S&TC's attention this quote from Professor Martin Ryder of Colorado University on the dangers of scientism encroaching into public policy \"... Policy can be informed by science, and the best policies take into account the best available scientic reasoning. Law makers are prudent to keep an ear open to science while resisting the rhetoricof the science industry in formulating policy. It is the role of science to serve the primary interests ofthe polity. But government in a free society is not obliged to serve the interests of science ... positivismand scientism move in where the discourse of science lacks self-reflection and where the spokesmen ofscience exempt themselves Technology Committee: Evidence 6.6. In conclusion, I would hope therefore that the S&TC considers the substantive points I have made, in regard to the growing evidence for this more than 200-year-old therapy, regardless of the accompanyingbias and abuse I have itemised above. For without that, it will be doubtful in my view, whether the STC willbe able to achieve an objective assessment of the evidence for homeopathy. Bibliography 1. Walach H.

The phrase \"homeopathic products\" is meaningless in this context. There are no products that are produced by the application of homeopathy. 2. The word \"homeopathic\" cannot be used to describe a product. A remedy is only \"homeopathic\" when matched to an individual according to the law of similars. It cannot be homeopathic in isolation but onlyin relationship to the state it is homeopathic to. 3. Pharmacists and some homeopaths do sometimes use the term \"homeopathic\" to describe a potentised remedy, but it is scientically incorrect and leads to confusion over the denition of homeopathy. 4. Potentised remedies are sometimes, but not always, used as part of the application of the homeopathic method of healing. 5. Homeopathy is not synonymous with very dilute substances.6. Instead of the phrase \"homeopathic products\", I suggest the more accurate Ev 101 Memorandum submitted by Professor John C McLachlan (HO 06) Response to the Consultation on Government policy on licensing of homoeopathic products, Government policy on the funding of homoeopathy through the NHS, and the evidence base onhomoeopathic products and services. I will consider the topics listed for consultation in reverse order, since the evidence base is paramount. TheEvidence Base on Homoeopathic Products and Services 1. Currently, regulated health professions are bound by the requirement for evidence based treatment. The GMC states 3\"In providing care you must provide e Vective treatments based on the best available evidence\". The Code of the Nursing and Midwifery Council4states \" You must deliver care based on the best available evidence or best practice\". Even in government, one of the Essential Professional Skills for Government competencies is: \" Analysis and use of evidence: Links evidence with specic outputs to challenge decision-making and identify ways to improve its quality and use \". Evidence-based medicine and public health have radically improved health, and continue to do so. It is hard to understand why this requirement shouldbe arbitrarily abandoned for alternative medicine practices. Yet despite the MHRA claiming that they\"ensure medicines work\" , they license homoeopathic products for which there is no evidence of e Ycacy, and indeed, evidence that they do not work. 2. It is sometimes erroneously claimed that the rules of evidence do not apply to homoeopathic medicine. Indeed the MHRA state so explicitly: \"Because of the philosophy of homoeopathy and the nature of the products, it is di Ycult to establish e Ycacy for homoeopathic products by way of clinical trials\" . 5This is quite untrue. The nature of homoeopathic products (frequently, pillules indistinguishable other than by the label)render them particularly well suited to randomised controlled trials: the argument that treatments areindividualised is irrelevant, since a patient can be prescribed an individualised homoeopathic treatment, thenentered into an allocation process by which they are randomised to either the homoeopathic or placebo arm.It is not philosophy or the nature of products which renders e Ycacy di Ycult to establish: it is lack of e Ycacy. 3. This line of argument by homoeopaths can be summarised as \"Evidence does not support homoeopathy\u2014so let us attack the concept of evidence\". However, since homoeopathic advocates cite theoutcomes of randomised trials when they believe they are favourable, and only denigrate them when theyare not, this argument is used inconsistently. If the normal standard for statistical signicance is set atp'0.05, then some false positives are inevitable, even with inert substances. It is consistent performance which is important, and I do not know of any examples of consistent e Ycacy for homoeopathic remedies in double blind randomised controlled trials. NHS Evidence 6on Complementary and Alternative Medicine, despite being led by a homoeopath practitioner, produces a paltry handful of debatable ndings each year.Although meta-analyses showing no e Vects of homoeopathy have been criticised by homoeopaths, 7they then rather miss the observation that any e Vects which are present are too small to be meaningful. 4. Accepting homoeopathic beliefs about the consequences of dilution also requires acceptance that the basic rules of physics and chemistry are held in abeyance. If this were true, it would be a revolution in physicsthinking comparable with that of relativity. Yet no serious physicist is interested in everlasting fame byexploring it\u2014because none assess it as other than fatuous. 5. The MHRA may have been misled by the view that homoeopathic remedies must be harmless, since they contain no active ingredients. And indeed, homoeopathy is only dangerous if you believe in it. Thedangers that arise if you truly believe are two fold. 6. Danger 1. Misdiagnosis by homoeopaths. It might be thought that homoeopathy merely operates as a placebo e Vect and for conditions which are chronic, di Ycult to diagnose or di Ycult to treat, and therefore does not pose potential harms. However, to tell which conditions are treatable by rational means requirestraining in evidence based methods, and misdiagnosis can be lethal. 7. Danger 2. Withdrawal from rational treatment. As private practitioners, homoeopaths have a vested interest in patients using their services. Alternative practitioners frequently attack rational evidence basedmedicine in a variety of ways, often tacitly, but sometimes explicitly. The natural outcome is for clients undertheir care to abandon evidence based methods for methods which do not require evidence. The consequences for this can be lethal, as in promoting homoeopathy for the treatment of HIV/AIDS. 8Some case histories are adduced to support this. 8. Nine year old Nahkira Harris died of diabetes after she did not receive insulin treatment which would have preserved her life.9The prosecutor said that the parents ignored advice to return her to hospital and sought homoeopathic remedies. The judge also criticised a GP, author of a book called \"How to usehomoeopathy e Vectively\", who was later severely admonished by the General Medical Council. Nahkira's 3GMC Good Medical Practice\u2014Delivering Good Clinical Care. Para 3. In GMC documents \"must\" means that it is obligatory, as opposed to \"should\". http://www.gmc-uk.org/guidance/good medical practice/index.asp 4http://www.nmc-uk.org/aArticle.aspx?ArticleID %3056 5Explanatory memorandum to the medicines for human use (national rules for homoeopathic products) regulations 2006. 6http://www.library.nhs.uk/CAM/ViewResource.aspx?resID Technology Committee: Evidence parents were convicted of manslaughter. Six months old Cameron Ayres \"died from a rare disorder after being denied conventional care by his parents who held strong beliefs in alternative medicine\".10The Telegraph headed the story \"Homeopathy couple refused help for their dying baby\". Nine month old Gloria Thomas died from an eminently treatable condition (eczema) because her parents, adherents ofhomoeopathy, withdrew her from rational treatment. 11\"Ms A\" died after a doctor with homoeopathic beliefs asked Ms A, to follow only \"homoeopathic remedies\". The GMC found the doctor guilty ofprofessional misconduct. 12 9. The MHRA have lent credibility to homoeopathic remedies, increasing the risks of such outcomes. As a leading homoeopathic manufacturer commented \" The fact that therapeutic indications may now be included on the packaging of licensed homoeopathic medicines not only opens the practice of homoeopathy up to newusers but also gives it added credibility \" 13 10. Further examples of risks posed by validation of homoeopathic remedies by government are that homoeopaths may advise travellers that their remedies act prophylactically against malaria14or advising patients not to get vaccinated.15 11. The MHRA has indicated that they are prepared to accept \"homoeopathic provings\" as evidence. What does this mean? An article called \"Trituration Proving of the Light of Saturn\" by Patricia Maher wasrecently published in the e-journal \" Interhomeopathy \". 16It says \" The remedy was made by exposing powdered milk sugar to a powerful telescope in Boston, Massachusetts while it was focused on the planet Saturnduring April 2009 \". After exposure to the remedy, seven \"provers\" (two of whom knew what the \"remedy\" was) recorded their conversations. There was a long conversation in which provers named their ve favouriteBeatle songs. From the start, conversation was lled with erotic double-entendres (\" How's my technique?\" ). One prover demonstrated a seductive way of eating a sandwich: \" if I could get food that way I would never be hungry... I want to draw you naked ...\" Now, given that there were four females and three males present, mild flirtation does not seem so surprising. Nonetheless, some physical symptoms were recorded. \" The female provers especially experienced a great deal of itchiness: Head, nose, eyes itchy. Head itchy. Back itchy,breasts itchy, thighs. Desire to yawn and stretch \". Yet clear therapeutic conclusions could be drawn. \" From a homoeopathic point of view, both the physical symptoms that appeared and the content of the discussion duringthe proving suggest that this remedy might be e Vective for accident-related trauma, bone and nerve damage. This remedy may also be e Vective for allergies, in light of all the itching that occurred \". These quotations are of course selected: read the entire article lest you think I am parodying it. Of course, Venus does not emitlight but merely reflects sunlight, and so this proving is as rational as astrology. Other provings (presumablyacceptable to the MHRA) have been conducted for cobwebs, 17barn owl feathers,18AIDS infected blood,19and mobile phone radiation.20 Government Policy on the Funding of Homoeopathy through the NHS 12. It follows from the foregoing that Government should not fund treatments which have zero e Ycacy, and pose hazards of misdiagnosis and withdrawal from treatment. Particularly regrettable is the attempt tohijack the term \"integrative\" to conceal the nature of alternative treatments. The positive aspects ofintegrative medicine are already a key part of the curricula of modern medical schools, and are a routinepart of the armoury of good doctors and health care practitioners. 13. It might be argued that the placebo e Vect of homoeopathy is su Yciently valuable to be worth paying for. However there is a profound dilemma relating to this use of NHS funds. If the practitioner believes thathomoeopathy is a placebo, then prescribing it requires her/him to lie to the patient, and this runs contraryto ethical practice in health care. If the practitioner believes that homoeopathy works as advertised, then they are a danger to the patient as the case histories above (frequently involving qualied medical personnel)demonstrate. Further, whether or not the practitioner believes in homoeopathy, the patient who is beingmisled might reasonably choose to believe in it, since it was endorsed by the NHS, and subsequently chooseto take advice on vaccination from a homoeopath, for instance. Government Policy on the Regulation of Homoeopathic Products 14. Policy should be based on evidence of e Ycacy as required for other products making medicinal claims. It is particularly regrettable that the MHRA should think it has a role in promoting this particularindustry. 21The MHRA stated \" Although the development of national rules by Member States under the 2001 Directive is optional, failing to introduce the scheme would inhibit the expansion of the homoeopathicindustry \". This solicitude is not extended to any other industry. 10Daily Telegraph 5 April 2000. 11http://www.smh.com.au/national/parents-guilty-of-manslaughter-over-daughters-eczema-death-20090605-bxvx.html 12http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/6255356.stm Nelsons, quoted BMJ 2009;338:b2055 14http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/newsnight/5178122.stm 15Ernst E.

November 2009 Memorandum submitted by the UK Advisory Committee on Malaria Prevention in UK Travellers (ACMP) (HO 07) 1. The UK Advisory Committee on Malaria Prevention in UK Travellers (ACMP), an independent expert committee of the Health Protection Agency has been asked to respond by the HPA to the call of yourcommittee for evidence on: \u2014 Government policy on licensing of homeopathic products\u2014 Government policy on the funding of homeopathy through the NHS\u2014 the evidence base on homeopathic products and services. 2. The ACMP has on several occasions considered the third question in relation to travellers who have been advised to take homeopathic prevention against malaria (not by NHS homeopathic practitioners) andsubsequently contracted the disease. 3. Malaria is a potentially fatal disease, almost completely preventable by a combination of mosquito bite prevention and antimalarial prophylaxis, which kills several people every year and causes over1,000-2,000 cases of malaria in the UK. There is no convincing evidence that homeopathic prevention ortreatment works, although no scientically robust trials have been conducted. 4. There is clear scientic evidence based on trials that several antimalarial drugs do substantially reduce the risk of malaria, as do insecticide-treated bednets. There is clear evidence that current antimalarial drugsare highly e Vective at treating malaria. 5. Given the seriousness of the disease and the clear evidence of other measures being e Vective no responsible homeopathic practitioner would consider recommending homeopathy in the view of the ACMP.We would strongly advise against homeopathic products for preventing or treating malaria being licensedin the UK on the basis of current evidence. The ACMP has no views on homeopathy more widely. Professor Christopher Whitty FRCP FFPH Acting chair, ACMP November 2009 Memorandum submitted by Cyril W Smith (HO 08) Executive Summary 1. Homeopathy involves frequencies and their e Vects on living systems. 2. Clinical evidence comes from hypersensitive patients whose reactions can be treated with specially prepared homeopathic potencies. 3. Homeopathic potencies involve the memory of water for frequencies.4. A theory based in quantum physics is supported by experimental evidence. 1. Introduction Homeopathy is one of the branches of Complementary and Alternative Medicine which involves the therapeutic use of frequency. For at least the past 60 years, the promulgated and accepted wisdom is thatthe only biological e Vects of non-ionising electromagnetic elds are thermal and as such can be reliably predicted from \"Classical Physics\". One must conjecture that the motives for this have been military, Technology Committee: Evidence commercial and legal. The majority of healthy persons have regulatory systems well able to cope with the natural and man-made electromagnetic environment as with other environmental stresses so, any frequencyeVects are not apparent. Since the 1970's the writer (Smith, 2008) has been involved with research into the ways that living systems make use of electric and magnetic elds and frequencies and has over 100 publications in this area. In 1982,he commenced an involvement with the problems of chemically sensitive patients who had becomehypersensitive to their electrical environment. This work quickly showed that once a threshold of intensityhad been exceeded, the relevant factor was frequency. Initially, patients were challenged with frequenciesfrom an oscillator at environmental eld strengths. Their reactions to specic frequencies were the same astheir reactions to the chemicals, volatiles or particulates to which they happened to be sensitive. The \"Miller Technique\" used in the treatment of such patients involves successive serial dilutions of the allergen until one is found which turns-o Vthe patient's reaction. This needs to be more precise than the standard homeopathic potencies. Here, succussion takes place by vortexing in the syringe. For the treatmentof electrical sensitivities a therapeutic frequency could be found, imprinted into water and used in the sameway as an allergen dilution even though there was no chemical component present. This tted convenientlyinto the existing facilities and practice of the hospital involved (Breakspear Hospital, Hemel Hempstead)and did not require an electrical oscillator for each patient. Rea et al. carried out a double-blind trial at the Environmental Health Centre, Dallas, Texas. Selected patients with electrically sensitivity could respond toa frequency to which they happened to be sensitive with 100% success and 0% response to placebos. Examination of frequencies which had a clinical e Vect showed a correlation with the endogenous frequencies on the acupuncture meridians. When an acupuncture point is stressed either by pressure or with aneedle, its endogenous frequency spreads throughout the body. Appropriate choice of meridians and pointsenables the acupuncturist to create a therapeutic frequency pattern from the patients own body elds. Dr.Reinhardt Voll showed that certain acupuncture meridians were linked to the autonomic nervous system(ANS). Homeopathic potencies can be selected to stimulate specic acupuncture meridians and thencespecic parts of the ANS. 2. T hePhysics of Homeopathy 2.1 Frequency, Coherence and Fractality Figure 1 DIAGRAM OF THE QUANTITIES ASSOCIATED WITH FREQUENCY amplitude phase difference (same frequency)COHERENT OSCILLATIONSFrequency = cycles/sec (Hertz,Hz) Wavelength = distance/cycle () 1 cycletime or space velocity = frequency x wavelength Figure 1 shows the quantities associated with frequency irrespective of what is oscillating. If a frequency is propagating through space, there is a velocity and an associated wavelength. The importance of frequency in biological systems was recognised by Herbert Fro \u00a8hlich FRS (Smith, 2008) who in the 1930's when told that the cell membrane potential was a fraction of a volt and existed across anextremely thin cell wall realised it represented an enormous electric eld, strong enough to align moleculesfor assembly and resonating at about 100 GHz. By 1967, he had applied the theory of coherent modes ofoscillation in non-linear systems and long-range phase correlations to biological order. The subsequentdevelopment of his ideas and the work of his world-wide circle of collaborators were edited by him into two\"Green Books\" : \"Coherent Excitations in Biological Systems\" and \"Biological Coherence and Response to External Stimuli\". In 1995, Preparata with Del Giudice and co-workers showed through quantum electrodynamics (QED) theory that water had phase coherence as a fundamental property arising from the exchange of radiation atthe natural resonant frequencies of the water molecule. In a coherent system, the distance over whichfrequency coherence persists ( coherence length) replaces velocity as the constant quantity making frequency proportional to velocity (see Figure 1) and a fractal quantity. Fractality enables the chemical, technologicaland biological frequency bands to interact. Table 1 shows the frequency fractals for light from a mercurydischarge lamp imprinted into water. If the chemical bond was not associated with frequency, spectroscopicanalysis would be impossible. Chemistry cannot be described Ev 105 Table 1 MULTIPLE FREQUENCIES FRACTAL EFFECT FOR THE MERCURY (Hg) OPTICAL SPECTRUM IMPRINTED INTO WATER. Hg lines Optical Microwave ELF nm Hz Hz 2.2 Fields In mathematics, a eldis a region of space containing mathematical objects, rather like the \"eld of view\" seen with binoculars. In physics, a eld is a region in which a mechanical force acts, for example the gravitational eld. The \"Classical Electromagnetic Field\" is the basis of electronics and radio. \"Classical Physics\" describes a system for which the phase is well dened and the number of particles (quanta) is too large to matter. Incontrast, a \"Quantum Field\" involves less particles and has a fundamental uncertainty described by theHeisenberg Relation (Smith, 2008). These elds can be electric or magnetic. The magnetic eld only exists in closed loops and a mathematical consequence is the magnetic vector potential explained theoretically by Aharanov and Bohm and laterfound experimentally. This generates an electric eld proportional to its frequency and in a coherent regionthis gives an oscillating potential which can be measured. 3. T hePhysics of Water Memory One important result from our clinical work was nding that the reactions of patients to environmental electromagnetic elds, chemicals, or potencies could be reproduced with frequency imprinted water. Waterin flame-sealed glass ampoules could be imprinted with frequencies through the glass and no possibility ofany chemical contact. This conrmed the basis of homeopathy as frequencies in water. In 1983, my laboratory (Smith, 2008) showed that living systems could respond to magnetic resonance conditions at geomagnetic eld strengths. This is a quantum e Vect but following its publication a cyclotron theory attempted to the keep the e Vects within \"Classical Physics\". Later this suggested that a frequency might be retained in water if the precession of proton spin could be synchronised to an applied frequency to generate an internal magnetic eld which exactly satised theproton magnetic resonance conditions locally within a coherence domain. This condition turned out to beindependent of the frequency to be remembered and would be stable unless the domain is thermally brokenup by removing the stabilising geomagnetic eld. The critical eld for this is about 340 nT making thecoherence domain 53 \u00b5m in diameter. The statistical fluctuation in the number of protons involved determines the bandwidth of the frequency imprint which can be parts per million in agreement withexperiment. Imprinting a frequency into water immobilises free protons increasing the pH value. Figure 2 shows the pH of a solution of sodium hydroxide at pH 8.01 had increased to pH 8.05 at memory saturation after377 separate frequencies had been imprinted. On erasure the pH returned to its Technology Committee: Evidence Figure 2 CHANGES OF Ph ON IMPRINTING AND ERASING FREQUENCIES. pH returns to original value after imprints have been erased pH 8.01 pH 8.05 0 100 200 300 377 Number of frequencies imprinted up to saturation 3.1 Writing Frequencies into Water Frequency information can be imprinted into a glass vial of water by succussion. This is what creates a homeopathic potency. Frequency information from a patient's body also can be imprinted if the vial is heldin a clenched st while succussing the protruding end. Imprinting can take place through the glass of a vial containing water by immersing it in frequency imprinted water. Water placed near to a source of frequencies such as an oscillator and coil, a chemical orhomeopathic potency can be imprinted by succussion or, with a strong permanent magnet or, by succussinga toroid (ring) of ferrite material. A sequence of 7-voltage pulses will e Vect an imprint; imprinting can also be done chemically. 3.2 Erasing Water Memory A homeopathic potency or a water imprint will be erased if the geomagnetic eld is shielded by placing it briefly in a steel box. Erasure occurs when thermal energy becomes greater than the internal magneticenergy. This threshold, at about 1% of the Earth's magnetic eld, is independent of the imprinted frequencyover at least the 13-decades from 10 -4Hz to 10!9Hz. Heating imprinted water alters the imprint so that it becomes \"hidden\" and living systems do not recognise it. It can be recovered by the application of certainfrequencies including that of the heart acupuncture meridian. Certain combinations of frequencies will self-erase, that is they are \"nilpotent\". 3.3 Reading Water Memory Frequencies in water and living systems present a great measurement problem. Clinically, they may be anywhere in the electromagnetic spectrum from milliHertz to GigaHertz and the bio-information is carriedon the magnetic vector potential component of the eld. Several techniques have been applied to the objective measurement of frequencies in water and homeopathic potencies. They can be made to work over a limited range of frequencies (Smith, 2008). 1. Electrodes immersed in water or a potency and connected to a low-noise high-gain amplier have been used by the writer and Dr. Wolfgang Ludwig. 2. Dr. Peter Gariaev has used a special 2-beam laser interacting with a potency; this results in the emission of a radiofrequency modulated with the signature of the potency. 3. Professor Vittorio Elia has used microcalorimetry to show a di Verence in heats of mixing between control water and a potency and in cooperation with Professor Claudio Cardella has shown thesame e Vect with water imprinted by placing in Ev 107 4. Dr. Karen Langer has used both delayed luminescence and also the coupling between Tesla coils to demonstrate e Vects from potencies. 5. Dr. Louis Rey has irradiated samples with high energy ionising radiation after freezing and on warming found di Verences in the thermoluminescence between potencies and controls. 6. Professor Luc Montagnier has shown that some DNA sequences in pathogenic bacteria and viruses have a characteristic frequency signature even at high dilutions of agitated aqueoussolutions.

Cyril W.Smith 10 October 2009 3.4 Chemical Frequency Signatures Homeopathic potencies start from a \"Mother Tincture\" which is usually of chemical or biological origin. Its chemical frequency signature is all that is needed for potentising. A homeopathic repertory shows the wide range of frequency templates available for potentisation. Experiments with n-hexane showed that only 14 ppm of water is needed for a frequency signature to develop. Since the n-hexane spectrum is in the far-infra-red (FIR), water can only interact here. Of the manyFIR water lines a few (357 cm -1, 213 cm-1and 128 cm-1) are coherent enough for a water vapour laser and for \"water memory\". The chemical frequency signatures calculated for n-hexane were as measured. The samecalculation applied to pairs of FIR water lines gave the measured frequency signatures of water. When afrequency is imprinted into water, the FIR frequencies develop two sidebands proportional to the imprintedfrequency with corresponding fractal sidebands in other parts of the electromagnetic spectrum. 4. H omeopathic Potencies When a single frequency is imprinted into water which is then serially diluted, the original frequency disappears to be replaced by the original frequency multiplied by the dilution ratio. Not all dilution ratiosdo this, some have no e Vect, others erase everything. Patterns developed from frequency signatures may be more complicated. Figure 5 shows the frequency pattern for a set of potencies of thyroxin. It demonstrates the frequency basis for potentisation of homeopathic remedies. Frequency erased water was imprinted with the completepattern of frequencies previously determined for thyroxin of potency D15. This was then potentised byconventional dilution and succussion. The frequencies measured for each synthesized potency were exactlythe same as those for the potencies prepared from the \"Mother Tincture\" chemical thyroxin. Yet, thesynthesized potencies had started from nothing but water. There is no discontinuity at potency D24 thedilution at which no molecule of an original 109 Figure 5 FREQUENCY PATTERN FOR POTENCIES OF THYROXIN.

Table 4 compares aspirin and aconite; combined they would stimulate the Du Mai meridian. Table 4 FREQUENCY SIGNATURES FOR SOLUBLE ASPIRIN AND ACONITE C6. _%stimulatory (hyperactive); `%depressive Between the states of health and disease there may be a state of mathematical chaos (Smith, 2009). Chaos has been demonstrated in respect of the cardiac signal of a healthy human as well as inelectroencephalograms, epidemics, fluid flow and oscillatory chemical reactions. A chaotic systemeventually settles down to its \"attractor\"\u2014a stable condition that may be a point focus or a limit-cycleoscillation. From the clinical and homeopathic point of view, any experiment involving a patient in a chaoticdomain is non-repeatable from the same initial condition. Homeopathy can operate in the chaos region toswitch a patient back from chaos to health. 6. S imiliters and Provings Hahnemann wrote, \"...that for the totality of symptoms to be cured, one must seek that medicine which has demonstrated the greatest propensity to produce either similar oropposite symptoms\". Frequencies patterns are generally biphasic showing alternately stimulation and depression of biological activity. Endogenous frequencies in biological systems fluctuate around their nominal value in a quasi-periodic manner which may be chaotic. Frequencies of acupuncture meridians can be Evidence homeopathic potencies which may stimulate or depress biological activity and hence can be \"therapeutic\" or \"proving\". Chronic exposure to frequencies can result in \"proving\" symptoms which may becomeindistinguishable from a disease state. In Table 5, the frequency pattern from a patient is compared to the frequency pattern of the homeopathic potency Lachesis C200 which may be the patient's similiter.

Our submission is based on ndings from the Northern Ireland Integrated Medicine Pilot Programme 2007-08.23The Pilot Programme was unique in that it was the rst of its kind in the United Kingdom to be commissioned by a Minister for Health. It was not a clinical trial per se, but an evaluation of a servicein which GPs were able to refer patients for a range of Complementary and Alternative Medical (CAM)treatments, including homeopathic medical treatment. TheNature of Evidence 2. Evidence from observational studies is highly appropriate for homeopathic medicine as the treatments are individualised and therefore not fully amenable to analysis by, for example, randomised controlled trials.We welcome the acknowledgment by the Chair of the National Institute for Clinical Excellence, Sir MichaelRawlins that greater weight should be accorded to evidence from observational studies of this kind. 23Evaluation of a CAM Pilot Project in Northern Ireland (2008) Ev 111 3. The ndings and the recommendations in the evaluation report (executive summary appended) bear out the proposals made by the NIAH in the years prior to the announcement of the Pilot Programme. Since1999 we briefed successive Ministers of Health and Department of Health o Ycials that the provision of Complementary and Alternative Medical (CAM) therapies such as Homeopathy would produce benets in: \u2014 Reduction in drugs expenditure \u2014 Alleviation of GP and hospital workload\u2014 Savings accruing from reduced sick leave\u2014 Increased creativity and productivity\u2014 General well-being of society 24 4. We also proposed that CAM therapies such as Homeopathy would make a signicant contribution toward solving the intractable problems in Government healthcare priority areas such as: \u2014 health inequalities\u2014 deprived areas\u2014e Vectiveness gaps in conventional medical treatments 25 5. The Report conrms that CAM treatments including homeopathic treatment delivered signicant health gains and cost-e Yciencies in all of the above circumstances. The evaluation includes analyses across a range of indicators, all of which bear out the case we presented in our briengs, as follows: 6.

V alue for Money and Efficiency We wish to draw the attention of the Committee to the amount of detail in the evaluation report in respect of wider social and economic context, which is more often than not omitted from such studies. We submitthat this provides not only evidence of cost-e Vectiveness of healthcare investment, but extremely useful information relating to the problems and management of healthcare inequalities and the acknowledgedeVectiveness gaps in conventional medical treatment, especially of chronic conditions endemic in deprived areas. 9. We are condent that if the homeopathic treatments provided in the Pilot Programme were subjected to full Social Return on Investment analysis, they would produce a high index of return compared to manyconventional treatments in the same circumstances. Government wishes to see more proof of value formoney and return on future healthcare investment, as reported by the NHS Cross-Regional Social ValueCommissioning Project: 10. Value for money is concerned not just with unit costs, but with what has been called the full value or public benet that a provider brings to delivering a service. This recognises that every time the public sector spendsmoney, it should do so in a way that achieves as many of its objectives as possible. That is, it is concerned with the value a provider creates across a range of outcomes over the longer term with the resources it is given. The draft NHS Constitution states that PCTs \"will use (their) resources for the benetof the whole community\". This is where social value concepts have a vital role to play. 29 11. C onclusions and Recommendations We respectfully suggest that: 12. In respect of the evidence for homeopathy the Committee considers and accords appropriate weight to evaluations of observational studies such as the Northern Ireland Integrated Medicine Pilot Programme. 13.In evaluation of the e Vectiveness of medical treatments the Committee takes into consideration the wider social and economic contexts for the treatments and outcomes, particularly in respect of social valueand Social Return on Investment analysis. 14. D eclaration of Interests The Northern Ireland Association of Homeopaths is a non-prot group which represents professional homeopaths and homeopathic medicine, and has had representation in the Northern Ireland Departmentof Health CAM Advisory Group. Appendix One 15. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY of the Independent Evaluation Report on the Northern Ireland Integrated Medicine Pilot Programme. 16. This report presents the ndings from an evaluation of a pilot project which provided patients with access to a range of Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) through their GP practice. 17. Overall 713 patients were referred to the project by their GP. Patients presenting to their health centre with musculo-skeletal and mental health conditions, were referred for a range of CAM therapies includingacupuncture, chiropractic, osteopathy, homeopathy, reflexology, aromatherapy and massage. 18. The project was commissioned by the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety with a view to exploring the potential for CAM within existing primary care services in Northern Ireland. Theproject was implemented by Get Well UK in two primary care centres in Northern Ireland: ShantallowHealth Centre in Londonderry and The Arches Centre in Belfast. 19. The evaluation, conducted independently by Social & Market Research (SMR), is based on an analysis of project monitoring data provided by Get Well UK; and focus groups and surveys of patients,CAM practitioners and GPs from the two participating health centres. 20. K eyFindings :ThePatient Experience Using the various data sources, the evaluation has found a signicant level of health gain for the vast majority of patients who have received complementary and alternative medicine as part of the pilot project.This is evidenced by the following: \u2014 Analysis of MYMOP (Measure Yourself Medical Outcome Prole) data, which was generated using a validated health instrument used for measuring patient health gain in general practice,found statistically signicant improvements on each of the health outcome indicators measured iethe severity of patient symptoms; the level of patient activity associated with their symptoms; and,overall patient wellbeing (source, MYMOP); \u2014 The proportion of patients reporting that the severity of their symptoms were \"as bad as it could be\", fell from 31% prior to treatment to 5% following treatment (source, MYMOP); 29NHS Cross-Regional SHA Social Value Commissioning Project Ev 113 \u2014 80% of patients recorded an improvement in the severity of their main symptom, with 73% recording an improvement in their level of activity associated with their main symptom (source,MYMOP); \u2014 67% of patients recorded an improvement in their wellbeing (source, MYMOP);\u2014 81% of patients said that their general health had improved, with a similarly high proportion of patients (82%) reporting to be less worried about their symptoms following treatment (source,MYMOP); \u2014 81% of patients reported an improvement in their physical health, with 79% reporting an improvement in their mental health (source, patient survey); \u2014 84% of patients directly linked the CAM treatments to an improvement in their overall wellbeing (source, patient survey); \u2014 62% of patients were su Vering less pain, with 60% having more control over pain (source, patient survey); \u2014 There was a 14 percentage point reduction in the proportion of patients using medication between the pre and post-treatment stages (ie down from 75% to 61%) (source, project monitoring data); \u2014 44% of patients who were taking medication prior to their treatment, had reduced their use of medication (source, patient survey); \u2014 Among patients using pain killers prior to treatment, 55% said that they use fewer pain killers following treatment (source, patient survey); \u2014 In the majority of patient cases, CAM practitioners reported an improvement in: patient quality of life; relief of presenting symptoms; relief of chronic conditions; increased mobility; increasedemotional stability; and, a reduction in patient worry (source, project monitoring data); \u2014 24% of patients who used other health services prior to treatment (eg other primary care services, secondary care services and Accident and Emergency), said they now use these services less often(source, patient survey); \u2014 64% of patients in employment said that following treatment they now take less time o Vwork. Among patients not in employment, 16% said that having the CAM treatments had encouragedthem to think about going back into employment (source, patient survey); \u2014 94% of patients would recommend CAM to other patients with similar health conditions (source, patient survey); \u2014 89% of patients expressed an interest in continuing with CAM, with just 30% saying they would be able to a Vord to continue with CAM treatments (source, patient survey); \u2014 Patients were supportive of CAM being integrated into primary health care, with a call for increased public awareness of the potential of CAM for health gain (source, patient focus groups); \u2014 Patients identied a need for CAM to be promoted among GPs in Northern Ireland, and for initiatives to be taken to help reduce the level of scepticism held by some GPs towards CAM(source, patient focus groups); 21. K eyFindings :TheGP E xperience \u2014 In 65% of patient cases, GPs documented a health improvement, with a high degree of correlation between GP and patient assessment of health improvement (source, project monitoring data); \u2014 In 65% of patient cases, GPs said they had seen the patient less often following the patient's referral to CAM (source, project monitoring data); \u2014 Improving patient health was found to be the main motivation for GPs getting involved in the pilot project (source, GP survey and focus groups); \u2014 Most GPs said that their understanding and knowledge of CAM had improved by participating in the pilot project, with most conceding that their knowledge was limited at the initial stages. SomeGPs had experienced di Yculty initially in matching their patients with appropriate therapies, with most of the GPs supporting the need for further educational interventions such as seminars, talkswith practitioners and having more written information on CAM (source, GP survey and focusgroups); \u2014 Half of GPs reported prescribing less medication for chronic or acute patients (source, GP survey);\u2014 Half of GPs reported that the option to refer their patients to CAM had reduced their workload, with two GPs pointing to a nancial saving for their practice. All but one of the GPs had seen theproject as a positive development for their practice, with all agreeing that it provided them withmore referral options (source, GP survey); \u2014 Most GPs reported that their patients were using Allied Health Professionals less often, with half saying that their patients were using secondary care services less often (source, GP Technology Committee: Evidence \u2014 Ten out of the 12 GPs surveyed had a more positive view of the potential for CAM within primary care, with all wishing to continue with the option of referring their patients to CAM (source, GPsurvey); \u2014 In 99% of patient cases, the GP said that they would be willing to refer the same patient, or another patient, to the Get Well UK service. Also in 98% of patient cases, the GP said they would be willingto recommend the service to another GP (source, project monitoring data); 22. K eyFindings :TheCAM P ractitioner Experience \u2014 CAM practitioners reported a health improvement in 77% of their patients on average, with health gains including: pain relief; improved quality of life; \u2014 improved mobility, stress relief and improved emotional wellbeing (source, practitioner survey);\u2014 CAM practitioners identied a need for a series of educational interventions targeted at GPs to improve their understanding of CAM and to better support them with matching health conditionswith appropriate therapies (source, practitioner survey and focus groups); \u2014 CAM practitioners called for GPs to supply more information on patient medical condition as part of the referral process (source, practitioner survey and focus groups); \u2014 CAM practitioners identied a tendency for GPs to refer patients with chronic medical conditions to the project, with practitioners concerned that the therapies may not be as responsive to this typeof patient compared to, for example, patients with acute medical conditions (source, practitionersurvey and focus groups); \u2014A Vordability was identied as the main barrier for patients wishing to continue with CAM (source, practitioner survey and focus groups); \u2014 All CAM practitioners supported the integration of CAM within primary health care, with patient health gain cited as the key benet (source, practitioner survey and focus groups); \u2014 CAM practitioners reported a more positive attitude to CAM among GPs who had participated in the project, with ongoing contact and communication between GPs and CAM practitionersidentied as a key requisite if CAM is to be rolled out more extensively across Northern Ireland(source, practitioner survey and focus groups); 23. R ecommendations (i) Given the evidence of health gain documented by patients, GPs and CAM practitioners, it is recommended that DHSSPS and the project partners explore the potential for making CAM morewidely available to patients across Northern Ireland. Not only has this project documentedsignicant health gains for patients, but it has also highlighted the potential economic savings likelyto accrue from a reduction in patient use of primary and other health care services, a reduction inprescribing levels and reduced absenteeism from work due to ill health. (ii) This pilot project has clearly demonstrated that CAM ts well within a primary health care context, with patients valuing the support and judgment of their GPs in accessing treatments. It isrecommended that DHSSPS and the project partners examine ways of integrating CAM withinprimary care, taking on board the need for a strategy to promote GP knowledge and understandingof CAM to ensure that health conditions are matched appropriately with CAM therapies. Astrategy to promote awareness and understanding of CAM among GPs, as well as the positivehealth gains for patients, should also go some way to addressing issues around scepticism held bysome GPs. (iii) To further assist the process of integrating CAM with primary health care, it is recommended that consideration be given to exploring the potential for sharing medical records with CAMpractitioners. Furthermore, consideration should be given to exploring the potential for CAMpractitioners to be involved in clinical meetings and case conferences, which may provide patients,particularly those with chronic health problems, with more treatment options. This may also leadto signicant cost savings for the health service. (iv) The project has highlighted a number of areas where the operation of a CAM service can be further improved. In particular, it is recommended that DHSSPS and the project partners explore ways ofensuring that patients are provided with accurate and up to date information at all points of thereferral process, as well as at the point of receiving treatments. In addition, the evaluation hasfound that patients may benet from a \"triage\" system to ensure appropriate matching of healthconditions and CAM treatments; (v) Given that the pilot project has raised expectations among patients, DHSSPS and its partners should consider a mechanism for ensuring that patients who presented with long-term illnesses,and in particular those who experience pain, be o Vered booster or maintenance sessions beyond the life of Ev 115 (vi) Given the limited number of CAM practitioners in Northern Ireland, and the di Yculties in identifying practitioners to participate in the pilot project, it is recommended that DHSSPS and theproject partners consider ways of retaining this resource within a model for wider service delivery. (vii) Given that the health outcomes for patients have been signicant, it is recommended that DHSSPS and the project partners consider the development of a public health information campaign aimedat promoting the potential benets of CAM. Allied to this point, it is recommended that DHSSPSand its partners examine the role of CAM in supporting health prevention and health promotionstrategies, given the evidence that patients are likely to adhere strongly to the advice provided byCAM practitioners. (viii) The evaluation has documented the positive impact of CAM on patients who are economically active, particularly in the context of helping people back into work following illness. It isrecommended that the outcomes from this project be shared with colleagues in other departments(eg Department for Employment and Learning), to allow them to examine the potential for CAMwithin their own operational areas., (ix) Given that the evaluation outcomes are based on the perception of the various stakeholder groups (ie patients, CAM practitioners and GPs), it is recommended that DHSSPS and the projectpartners give consideration to integrating other approaches to measuring health impact (eg aformal case control study) on an ongoing basis. November 2009 Supplementary memorandum submitted by Northern Ireland Association of Homeopaths (HO 9a) We wish to draw your attention to an error in the oral evidence given to the Science and Technology Committee by Mr Mike O'Brien MP, Minister for Health Services, on 30 November 2009. In response to Q174, Mr O'Brien said \"...There was also some research done in Northern Ireland in an examination of the e Vect of a number of complementary and alternative medicines not including homeopathy.\" Presumably the research to which Mr O'Brian was referring was the Complementary and Alternative Medicines Pilot Project, run by the Northern Ireland Department of Health during 2007-08, which was adirect result of a campaign by our organisation. As you will see from the written evidence we have submitted to the Committee, Homeopathy was absolutely central to this successful project, and was found by the auditors to be rather more e Vective than other therapies across a range of chronic health problems. Kenneth Mayne RSHom Chair December 2009 Memorandum submitted by Les Rose (HO 10) 1. L icensing 1.1 The National Rules Scheme This allows homeopathic products to bear therapeutic indications, and is not based on any evidence at all. The MHRA consultation which preceded the new legislation, MLX312, openly admitted that\"homeopathic products have di Yculty in demonstrating e Ycacy in clinical trials\". As the MHRA rightly insists on clinical trial evidence for orthodox drugs, this was the clearest admission that the MHRA knewhomeopathic products to be ine Vective. One reason that the MHRA gave for forcing though the rules was that to do nothing would have inhibited the expansion of the homeopathic industry. It is not at all clear asto why this was important to the MHRA, or why it was in the public interest to be o Vered an increasing number of ine Vective products\u2014and to be lied to about their lack of e Vect. However the MHRA is not funded by taxation but by fees, and it is certain that not issuing new licences would have cut o Van income stream. 1.2 Double Standards The MHRA's report on the MLX312 consultation minimised opposition and emphasised support from industry. Yet the new legislation does not comply with classical homeopathic teaching, which is thattreatment must be individualised. The labelling regulations cater for pre-packaged products available inretailers such as (and especially) Boots, which are of course not individualised. There can be absolutely nopossibility of the careful recording of history and symptoms which are the homeopath's stock in trade. Yetthe homeopathy companies supported the regulations enthusiastically. This shows the level of duplicityendemic in the practice Technology Committee: Evidence Curiously, the rst product to receive a licence under the new rules was homeopathic arnica, which has most recently been tested in clinical trials and found to be ine Vective. Also, it violates the \"like cures like\" principle of homeopathy, so makes no sense even under the bizarre requirements of the new rules. 2. F unding 2.1 Cash Costs I have submitted a separate report on primary care trust funding trends. There are however other costs of homeopathy. For example, central government paid some \u00a320 million for the refurbishment of the RoyalLondon Homeopathic Hospital. The business case for this project said nothing at all about the clinicaloutcomes that would result from this expenditure. 2.2 Potential Cost Savings The actual amount of money spent on homeopathy is a small part of the NHS budget. But it has the e Vect of undermining the e Vort to make evidence based practice (EBP) the norm. Critics of orthodox medicine state that a large proportion of it is not evidence based. This is not true to the extent claimed, but apart fromfalling victim to the tu quoque fallacy, it misses the point. The NHS could make very large savings by progressing more rapidly towards full EBP. There would be no better demonstration of such a commitmentthan to close its homeopathic hospitals as soon as possible. Yet it is astonishing to see that the NHS seems determined to repudiate EBP. It has just been announced that the pilot patient budgets scheme will allow the money to be spent on complementary medicine,including homeopathy. If the idea of this scheme was to put patients in control of their health, what messagedoes this transmit? Here was an opportunity to educate patients about cost-e Vectiveness, but instead they are put in charge of wasting public money. Patients will therefore demand the right to spend their budgetson whatever they like. There is a virtually endless choice of medical fads and fashions to feed that demand. 3. E vidence 3.1 The Quality of Evidence It is important to focus on the best quality evidence. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) provide the most rigorous test of a therapeutic claim. Homeopaths either denigrate RCTs as inappropriate for theirspeciality, or select poor quality RCTs that spuriously show positive results. They also cite uncontrolledobservational studies which are no more than customer satisfaction surveys. It is true that a broad andinclusive approach needs to be taken to clinical evidence. Thus pragmatic trials and observational studiesare part of the mix. But it is a serious mistake to rely on these and to dismiss RCTs. Evidence based medicineis one of the greatest achievements of science. It has the RCT at its core. RCT evidence has overturned manyaccepted practices, often by showing them to be harmful, and commonly by showing them to be ine Vective. 3.2 Spurious Evidence Homeopaths claim that substances diluted beyond Avogadro's number have specic therapeutic e Vects. RCTs, especially when assembled into meta-analyses and systematic reviews, clearly show that this is nottrue. Some homeopaths argue that specic and non-specic e Vects cannot be separated (as do some sociologists). These arguments try to recruit support from unrelated elds such as quantum mechanics. Forexample, long papers have been written on \"patient-practitioner entanglement\". No experimental orobservational evidence has been o Vered to support these ideas. They are no more than a smokescreen to hide the fact that specic e Vects of homeopathic dilutions do not exist. 3.3 The Ethical Dilemma There is a serious ethical problem if treatments that are e Vectively placebos are to be o Vered to patients. Doctors are required by the terms of their registration to give treatments that they reasonably expect to beeVective. By any scientic test, homeopathic products are ine Vective, placing them outside EBP. Also, doctors have to obtain informed consent for treatment. Therefore to prescribe homeopathy doctors mustinform patients that they are giving them a placebo. They must convey to patients what the scienticevidence is. This is a principle that is extremely poorly enforced by the GMC and the medical Royal Colleges.The various professional bodies for homeopaths ignore EBP altogether, as does the voluntary regulationscheme launched by the Complementary and Natural Healthcare Council. This is dishonest, and demeaningfor patients. If patient choice is to mean anything, it must be informed Evidence Ev 117 Declaration of Interests I am a freelance clinical science consultant with over 30 years of experience in clinical research. I do voluntary work for two charities, Sense About Science and HealthWatch, in support of evidence basedmedicine. I do not receive any payments, in cash or in kind, for these activities. Most of my professionalclients are pharmaceutical companies, but they have no connections with this voluntary work. Les Rose BSc CBiol FSB FICR MAPM November 2009 Memorandum submitted by Dr Andy Lewis (HO 11) Government Policy on Licensing of Homeopathic Products 1. Currently, the licensing of homeopathic products is not made on the basis of evidence. This is in stark contrast to how other medicinal products are licensed in this country. Indeed, it would only be possible togive MHRA licences to homeopathic products if the requirement of evidence of e Ycacy were dropped as these products are not medicinal products but pseudomedical products based on magical thinking and pre-scientic ideas. 2. The MHRA allow sellers to submit evidence from homeopathic \"provings\" as evidence. A proving is where a homeopath takes a new type of homeopathic pill to see what symptoms it generates. Homeopathsbelieve \"like cures like\", so an onion, which makes your eyes stream, can cure hayfever\u2014allegedly. However,homeopathic pills have been so diluted that no ingredients actually remain. What homeopaths \"prove\" isplain sugar pills\u2014any symptoms they note are either coincidental or imaginary. There is no good evidenceto suggest that homeopathic proving are a reliable means of generating a homeopathic \"symptom picture\".The largest ever controlled homeopathic proving showed that there were no observable e Vects. 30This is consistent with proving being nonsense and MHRA rules relying on nonsense methods to show e Ycacy. 3. Despite the regulations, many homeopathic pharmacists continue to sell homeopathic pills with specic indications without a license. To test this, last year, visited London's Nelson's HomeopathicPharmacy just o VOxford Street. I went in and said I needed something for an upset stomach and that I had diarrhoea. \"Do you have anything like Imodium?\" I was told that the stu Vthey had would not just \"suppress my symptoms\" 4. I was given a tub of pills with the following label: TRAVELLER'S DIARRHOEA RELIEVES SYMPTOMS OF DIARRHOEA & VOMITING DUE TO CONSUMPTION OF UNWASHED FRUITS, VEGETABLES, BAD MEAT OR FISH. DOSAGE. TAKE 2 TABLETS EVERY HOUR UNTIL BETTER ARSENICUM 30/PODOPHYLUM 30/PYROGEN 6/CARBO VEG 30/NUX OF CHILDRENS REACH NELSON'S HOMEOPATHIC PHARMACY 73 DUKE STREET, LONDON W1K 5BY 020 7629 3118 P 5. On 28 March 2008, I submitted an enquiry to the MHRA suggesting that this might be an illegal product as it had no marketing authorisation. On 14 April 2008 I was told that the case had been passedonto the MHRA's Enforcement and Intelligence Group. I nally got a reply some 17 months later to tell methat \"The outcome of the investigation is that following advice from the Enforcement Unit, Nelson's haveremoved the product you mentioned from their display shelves.\" 6. To date, the product is still available for sale 31on the Nelson's web site along with many other similar products with specic indications. You can also see other similar products that are intended to cureconstipation, accident & injury, allergic reactions, bites & stings, hangover & indigestion, heat exhaustion,jet lag, and sun exposure. All are similarly ine Vective. 7. Whilst these conditions may be relatively minor, other homeopathic pharmacies sell remedies for much more serious conditions. Neal's Yard Remedies were selling sugar pills to customers and telling them thatthese could prevent malaria. The BBC undertook an investigation and interviewed their \"Medicines\"Director, who stormed out of the meeting after being asked if this was ethical and legal. 32After the BBC forwarded on their evidence, the MHRA investigated and merely slapped their wrists. This is despite thefact that this product has the potential to kill if taken in the place of a real malaria prophylactic. 8. It would appear that the MHRA take a very light touch and piecemeal approach to investigating this widespread abuse of the regulatory system. 30Ultramolecular homeopathy has no observable clinical e Vects.

Homeopathic pharmacies are full of products with direct and implied claims. In order to understand the extent of the problem it is necessary to understand mainstream homeopathic beliefs. The pharmacies arestocked with products that are often derived directly from diseased tissues, vaccines and infectious samples.These are designed to treat or prevent the diseases they are derived from. Visiting a homeopathic pharmacyweb site will show many products with implied indications. 33These are often in the form of what homeopaths call nosodes where some diseases tissue or some other \"infectious\" agent is taken and serially diluted and shaken and probably banged against a leather bible many times to create the homeopathic pill.The remedy lists of Ainsworths show products for each Influenza strain going back 20 years. You will ndhomeopathic replacements for Measles vaccine, Parotitis vaccine (mumps) and Rubella. You ndhomeopathic sugar pills for all forms of Hepatitis, strains of TB, and Typhoid, as well as the usual comedyremedies such as shipwreck, trout and Ayres rock. 10. These products are making implicit claims to be alternatives to real vaccines. They would appear to be all unlicensed remedies. 11. In my opinion, it is a mistake to regulate homeopath products as if they were medicines, with or without di Verent levels of evidence for e Ycacy. Homeopathy is not a medicine. It is a pseudo-medicine with believers who belong to more of a cult than a profession. It is a disgrace that these products can appear onthe same shelf-space as real medicinal products with misleading claims ratied by the MHRA. Claims madeor implied by homeopaths should be subject to Trading Standards laws rather than given the false legitimacyof MHRA approval. 12. It is wrong to allow this to continue on the basis of consumer \"choice\". Choice can only be meaningfully be exercised when it is informed. In buying medicines, we so often have to defer to experts\u2014we cannot always check all claims all the time\u2014we are all \"vulnerable\" consumers in this context. TheMHRA has an overriding duty to ensure it is not helping to mislead consumers when they are making theirchoices about medicines. TheEvidence Base on Homeopathic Products and Services . 13. It is absurd to continue to question the evidence base of homeopathy. The question was settled in the 1830's. It is only homeopaths who continue to believe that there is something special going on in their pills.If homeopathy had not been invented around 1800 but turned up today, would be seriously be consideringfunding this with millions of pounds in the NHS? The concept would appear absurd and the work of feveredimaginations. It is mere familiarity of this delusion that stops us taking this approach now. 14. Homeopaths continue to press that there is an evidence base. This is usually based on the following fallacies: (a) A \"wealth\" of positive evidence. Of course, it is possible to make a case for any absurd proposition if you only present positive evidence. Clinical research can very often create false positive resultsby chance, poor study design or fraud. In order, to evaluate a proposition, all evidence must betaken into account\u2014positive, negative and neutral. Homeopathy does not stand up to suchscrutiny. (b) Selective quoting of review conclusions. Many systematic reviews have show the weakness of the evidence base. However, within such reviews there have been some hints of positive results. It isnow thought that such hints are the result of poor input studies\u2014garbage in, garbage out. As theyears have gone by, the reviews have become more sophisticated and clearly shown that studieswith better methodologies and larger numbers of participants fail to show positive e Vects for homeopathy. Shang (2005) is the most denitive here. 34 Homeopaths have attempted to discredit Shang. They have failed. They assert that Shang wouldhave come to di Verent conclusions if di Verent studies or di Verent criteria were included. This is self evident and irrelevant. Shang could be discredited if homeopaths could show a quality reanalysisthat came to a conclusion opposite to that given\u2014they have not been able to do so. 33http://www.ainsworths.com/site/combination.aspx 34Are the clinical e Vects of homoeopathy placebo e Vects? Comparative study of placebo-controlled trials of and Evidence Ev 119 (c) Claims of success in distant lands and distant times. Very often claims exist that homeopathy cured the 1918 flu epidemic or is used successfully in Cuba. These are anecdotal stories with no hardevidence to back them up. (d) Claims of physical experiments that show genuine e Vects of the \"memory of water\". None of these experiments have been taken seriously and have not been authoritatively replicated. (e) Claims that quantum mechanics hold the answer. A few academics have ddled with the language of quantum theory and tortured it into the world of magic medicine. It is muddled andunconvincing and the authors involved appear to have a very poor grasp of the quantum theory. Declaration of Interests I am a writer about quackery on the web site quackometer.net.

Introduction 1.1 Homeopathic Pathogenetic Trials (HPTs), or, as they used to be called, homeopathic remedy provings, are the pillar of homeopathy.[1]Given their scientic importance, we submit this document to the Commons Science & Technology Committee in its Evidence Check of Homeopathy. 1.2 Hahnemann founded homeopathy on the basis of his own experience by ingesting China bark;[2,3] these were the rst HPTs proper. The Hahnemannian version of an HPT is the following idea: Take a purportedly medicinal substance whose therapeutic or pharmacological e Vect you do not know. Have some healthy volunteers ingest it in a dose that is likely not harmful. Note down the symptoms these volunteersexperience. Use the symptoms to guide your application in ill people: whenever ill people present with acollection of symptoms that could be seen in healthy volunteers, use the same substance to treat the illperson. Thus, the HPT is in fact an operationalisation of the similia rule. In order to know what the similarsymptoms are that should be looked out for, you need to know them in the rst place. An HPT providesyou with this knowledge. 1.3 A large part of the Materia Medica Pura is actually a result of these early provings. Later on he discovered a good way of diminishing the strong symptoms by diluting his medications, serendipidouslyhitting at succussion and potentisation, the other important principle of homeopathy. In his nal edition ofthe Organon, he made 30CH 35the standard potency for HPTs. This seems to be a practice adhered to for quite some time.[4,5]In fact, a lot of the standard polychrest medicines in use by homeopaths today date back to Hahnemann's own HPTs. They have not gone unchallenged,[6-11]but pragmatically seem to be still useful. 1.4 Although the rst blinded and placebo controlled trials in the history of medicine were such early HPTs,[12-14]the circular epistemology of homeopathy placed less emphasis on the methodological rigour of HPTs than on the usefulness of the symptoms derived from them. It was only in more recent years, duringthe revival of homeopathy research in the seventies and eighties in Germany and elsewhere that the questionwas asked, whether symptoms derived by such HPTs or provings are actually di Verent from the placebo. A recent systematic review of all HPTs available from 1945 until 1995\u2014156 studies altogether\u2014is not veryflattering the methodological sophistication of HPTs. [15,16] 35ie a potency that has been diluted 30 times in the ratio 1:100 (hence \"C\" for centum\u2014hundred) in separate heNa\u00a8veApproach 2.1 Testing the Individualised Di Hypothesis: Randomised take Belladonna 12/30CH or placebo in a randomised order, double blind. Randomising the sequence of Belladonna and placebo periods, four weeks each, where only the rstday of each week was a day when a remedy was to be taken. Participants noted their symptoms in diariesthat collected a predened set of symptoms, half of which were Belladonna symptoms, the other halfsymptoms not typical for Belladonna. This enabled straightforward randomisation tests that allow thedenition of statistical signicance on an individual level to determine whether the number of Belladonnasymptoms was di Verent with Belladonna from placebo. Quite paradoxical results were reported. [17,18]Of the 25 experiments, one individual had signicantly (p %0.01) more Belladonna symptoms with Belladonna, one had signicantly more Belladonna symptoms with placebo, and in several cases there were interestingchanges with Belladonna that were graphically obvious but that were not signicant. 2.2 Replicating the Na \u00a8ve Approach 2.2.1 In the meantime Walach et al ran a larger replication study using a similar design as in the rst Belladonna study, improved by several design features: [19]they had more participants (n %87), we introduced a wash-out period of one week between the experimental phases of the crossover-design and reduced theintake of medication or placebo to two weeks each, gave medication only during the rst three days of therst week and then had people observe for the rest of the two weeks. They used the same structured diaryand, based on our previous study, formulated some hypotheses that guided us towards combining symptomcategories to clusters to be tested experimentally. Although there was a clear and signicant di Verence between baseline and each of the experimental interventions in some of the variables, there was no signicantdiVerence between homeopathy and placebo in those predened categories. Thus, the initial tentative results were not replicable, and there was no indication from this study that symptoms produced by placebo andthose produced by Belladonna 30CH were in any way di Verent from each other. [20] 3. S crutinising the DataMoreCarefully using Grade -of-Membership Analysis 3.1 Intrigued by the phenomenology of the results Walach thought that something di Verent was actually going on in the background variability in both groups. The problem was that there were not only any symptoms that were indistinguishable under both conditions, but that Belladonna-specic symptoms were seen to a large extent also with placebo. That was the scientic puzzle. Having ruled out methodologicalartifacts, such as carryover e Vects or response bias, we were quite convinced that this was a genuine e Vect. To probe this further Walach employed a very sensitive multivariate method: Grade-of-Membership (GoM)Analysis on the dataset of the 2001 study. [21] 3.2 In essence GoM analysis is a multivariate model.[22,23]While most multivariate analysis models, such as the General Linear Model, use additive models, GoM uses a multiplicative algorithm solved by aniterative maximum-likelihood approximation. This allows for the multivariate usage of many variables evenwith few cases and it is very sensitive. Normally, we think of group membership as a categorical event: weeither cast a vote for a candidate, or we don't; we either belong to a group, or we don't. GoM allows us togroup people according to a grading, a kind of probability judgment of belonging to a group, expressed inpercent. So a particular person might belong to an experimental group to some degree of probability, andalso, to a lesser degree of probability, to another group. More importantly, the analysis also denes therelevance of the variables that are used to reach the decision. Using GoM, Walach identied to which extent each individual belonged to the Belladonna and to the placebo condition and which variables predicted this group membership, analysing the rst and second halfof the crossover design separately. The results are revealing (Table 1): 3.3 Table 1\u2014Results of a Grade of Membership Analysis of the Data from the Replication Belladonna HPT: [19,21]Variables used to Predict Membership of Participants to Groups in Phase 1 or Phase 2 of the Crossover Study, and Likelihood of Group Membership Predicted by a Variable Category Homeop.

The rst column indicates the variable used, the following two columns show the predictionof membership (expressed as percentage) in the rst and the second phase of the trial, when homeopathy(Belladonna C30) is taken, the last two columns when placebo is taken. It is interesting to compare thepercentages of membership prediction for columns Homeopathy phase 1 and Placebo phase 1, and then thesame for phase 2. Ideally, if separation of the groups were perfect, the two homeopathy columns should berelatively similar to each other and very di Verent from two placebo columns. They are not. So we see symptoms that dene membership in the Belladonna condition (symptoms of the nose, for instance, 60%membership association with Belladonna in phase 1) that are virtually reduced to unimportance in phase2 (only 5%), and the other way round. More importantly some of the symptoms are quite typical forBelladonna (symptoms of the throat, for instance, or symptoms starting in the afternoon). It seems thatsome symptoms typical for Belladonna have emerged during the HPT. So the problem really is that thetypical symptom pattern is shifting to placebo, at least partially, during the second half of the trial. Althoughonly exploratory it highlights the phenomenology of HPTs with a very sensitive quantitative pattern-recognition technique. Most recently, a careful German re-proving of Galphimia glauca has producedexactly this result. [24] 3.5 The tentative conclusion from this re-analysis was that obviously homeopathic remedies do produce some specic symptoms but they also produce these specic symptoms under placebo. Is it due to theshortcomings of our method, or is the phenomenon real? Walach had started working on the assumptionthat the e Vects of homeopathy are due to what we have called generalised entanglement [25]and which I have used to render a rational reconstruction of a non-classical model of homeopathy.[26]By that we mean that the e Vects of homeopathy may be specic, but they are due to non-local correlations as a consequence of the systemic set-up of homeopathy and the treatment situation. This is a consequence of how the whole system isformally constructed. A corollary of this model is that it would predict some specic symptoms also in thecontrol group and that, with repeated experimentation, the specicity is bound to vanish. [27] 3.6 This sets up a conundrum: How are we to prove experimentally that homeopathic remedies are producing specic symptoms if, by the very experimental set-up, we are likely to destroy this e Vect? 4. E xploring NewRoads 4.1 A New HPT Model 4.1.1 Walach et aldeveloped a completely new approach out of the experiences of the previous trials[28] and decided to use a di Verent HPT methodology. The methodological reasoning is the following: (a) A full phenomenological account of all experiences should enter the database. All participants are encouraged to report every occurrence that is unusual for them in a diary. To enhance the recall ofsuch events, a supervision interview is conducted every day either by phone or personal interviewby a supervisor. (b) As controls we introduce blinding and randomisation. Hence none of the participants knows what remedy is being used, nor whether they are randomised to receiving placebo or real substance. (c) In order to exclude any e Vects of suggestion and social desirability, the substance is chosen out of a predened list by a third party at random, blinding also the director of the study and all sta V associated with handling data. This ensures an unbiased experience and processing of symptomsas much as possible. (d) Medication is taken individually, until symptoms appear. If no symptoms appear after three days, the intake is stopped and the individual taken out of the study. (e) If the symptom database has been created and is closed, all symptoms are scrambled up, dissociated from their temporal and individual ordering by putting them into the head-to-foot-scheme familiarfrom homeopathic repertories, in symptom units that correspond to these rubrics. (f) The database is then given to a materia medica expert not otherwise associated with the study. This expert does not have access to the randomisation code but is given the name of the remedy tested.At this stage, this person and the pharmacist who chose the remedy are the only ones privy to thisinformation. (g) The expert then uses a computerised repertory to decide, for every symptom, whether it is a symptom typical for the remedy according to the sources, or not. Thus, the remedy typicalsymptoms are counted as \"1\", the Technology Committee: Evidence (h) The database is transformed back into the group system. For every participant we count the number of symptoms typical for the remedy and the number of atypical symptoms, averagingacross the experimental and control group. This gives a clear testable quantitative outcome scorethat can be easily tested. 4.2 Pilot Studies Using the New Methodology 4.2.1 Walach et al then completed four studies following this model. The rst two studies were pilot studies. [29,30]In one study Cantharis (chosen randomly from a list of 12 lesser remedies) was evaluated against placebo, in the other Calendula, Ferrum muriaticum (also chosen randomly from a list) and placebo in athree-armed design. In the rst study there were more symptoms typical for Cantharis in the Cantharis groupthan in the placebo group during and less atypical symptoms, but there were also more symptoms typicalfor Cantharis in the placebo group, which was unexpected (Figure 1). 4.2.2 Figure 1\u2014Results of the Cantharis Proving: [30]Symptoms Typical for Cantharis and Atypical Symptoms During Baseline and During the Proving Period, for the Cantharis and the Placebo Group Typical Ba Atypical Basel. Typical Proving Atypical Proving0510152025303540 Number of the e Vect was not signicant in this pilot it was quite sizeable (d %0.4). When the group were randomised to receive homeopathic Cantharis but were dosed with it later there were also moresymptoms typical for Cantharis. This e Vect size was very large\u2014d %1.0. Ideally, one would have double or triple-evaluation of the same database and only use symptoms that all agree on for calculating inter-raterreliability. This process mirrors faithfully normal practice where one homeopath translates symptoms intoremedy pictures. 4.2.4 In the three-armed study [29]we found a similar and quite puzzling result. Here the total number of symptoms experienced during the proving phase in the experimental groups was signicantly di Verent between the experimental and the placebo control group, as were the number of Calendula symptoms in theCalendula group (Figure 2) with a large e Vect size of d %2.8. 4.2.5 Figure 2\u2014Three-Armed vs. (n %7 participants in each group): Mean Number of Symptoms Typical for Calendula, Placebo051015Calendula Symptoms Ferr. mur SymptomsNonspec. Symptoms Total Symptoms 4.2.6 What can also be seen is that signicantly more Calendula symptoms were experienced by participants who had taken Ferr. mur. compared with those taking placebo (e Vect size d %1.75), and that a sizeable number of Ferr. mur. symptoms were also observed in the Calendula group. While this e Vect might also be due to the fact that Ferrum muriaticum is a little known substance and hence di Ycult to identify, the observation that Calendula symptoms were more frequent in the Ferrum mur group is di Ycult to reconcile with the assumption that these e Vects are artifacts. 4.3 Two Parallel Replication Studies 4.3.1 Following on from these observations Walach et al conducted a study with two arms, placebo vs. homeopathy, another one with three arms, comparing placebo to two di Verent remedies with one of the remedies being common to both studies. The remedies chosen from a predened list of 20 remedies, in thiscase newly proven ones; Ozone and Iridium, with Ozone being the one common to both studies. When bothstudies were combined, a clear signicant di Verence for symptoms typical for Ozone during the treatment period emerged (Figure 3). 4.3.2 Figure 3\u2014Combination of Two Studies Testing Ozone vs. Placebo. [31]Signicantly More Symptoms Typical for Ozone During the Experimental Phase in the Group Taking Ozone than in the GroupTaking Placebo Placebo Ozone Groups140 120 100 80 60 40 20 0 Mean number of symptoms (95% CI) total number of symptoms proving total number of symptoms non-specific symptoms proving ozone symptoms proving ozone syptoms baseline ----------------------- p = 0.045 ---------------- ------------------ p 5. T heWayForward 5.1 Walach et albelieve they have proven the case that this new methodology of re-proving homeopathic remedies can now tease out at least partially the specicity of homeopathic remedies vis-a`-visplacebo in a rigorous experimental design, where other recent approaches have failed.[32-35]While HPTs can be conducted this way, one should avoid the direct replication of any study by using the same types of remedies. A wayforward would be to test di Verent remedies, perhaps in several studies with more than two arms that have one or two remedies in common. Then a decision could be made, after the fact and at random, which armsto discard and which to combine. By the combination of changing remedies each time a study is conductedand combining di Verent studies, it might be possible to produce enough single studies with signicant outcome testifying to the specicity of symptoms and thus avoiding the observed decline e Vect. [36]This methodology has only one purpose: to discover whether known homeopathic substances are able to producesymptoms in healthy volunteers that are di Verent from those elicited by placebo. Its pre-supposition has been mentioned: it can only be used if the medication in question is known. 5.2 To the novice and the outside observer it should also be clear that the proving methodology of homeopaths for the purpose of discovering new remedies is di Verent from the author's in several respects, as a rule: they very often do not have symmetrical control groups, ie only few persons, though randomisedand mostly double-blinded, receive placebo, [9,24,37]and very often symptoms appearing in the control group are also counted as remedy symptoms, if they full the typical criteria for a symptom dened by Bayr andStu\u00a8bler [38]. 5.3 There is surely a common core to the proving methodology: the careful observation of changes by experienced provers who ingest a potentised substance unknown to them. The symptoms are noted in a diaryand veried with a supervisor on a daily basis. Little has changed in principle since this methodology wasinvented. [39]The only thing we have become suspicious about is how powerful placebos are, and that there are likely a lot of specic symptoms to be observed even under placebo. Everyone still adhering to a classicalpharmacological model when investigating homeopathy will have di Yculty explaining this conundrum. Homeopathic provings are di Ycult to investigate but as we begin to understand the process, our methodology improves as it becomes more informed. References 1. Walach H.

Committee: Evidence Declaration of Interests Professor George Lewith is a homeopathic practitioner and a researcher. Professor Harald Walach is a researcher and has no conflict of interest. November 2009 Memorandum submitted by the Leeds Institute of Diagnostics and Therapeutics, University of Leeds (HO 15) 1. In addressing the questions posed in relation to the Government's use of evidence in policy-making regarding homeopathy; (1) What is the policy? (2)On what evidence is the policy based? it is important to recognise that clinical evidence is characterised by its incremental and sometimes less than perfect nature.Many clinical decisions are made on the balance of probabilities suggested by the evidence, rather than clear,unequivocal evidence to support particular decisions. Scientic evidence is supplemented by clinicalexperience and knowledge when clinical decisions are made in practice. Evidence used for policy-making isno di Verent in that it too can only represent the best information available at a particular time, and equally must be balanced against other types of evidence, including economic and ethical considerations. 1. The proposed \"evidence check\" for homeopathy should therefore be undertaken within the context of our wider understanding of the nature and value of evidence in other clinical spheres. 2. In particular, it is important to have a clear framework for assessing the existing evidence which takes into account the gradations of certainty that are apparent in any systematic review of the literature. Onesuch framework would be that provided by the British Medical Journal's \"Best Health\" project.http://besthealth.bmj.com This Web-based project aims to inform patients and practitioners of the extentand certainty of existing scientic evidence for particular treatments and conditions. The following isextracted from this website; 2.1. Best Health looks at medical research that is published in journals all over the world. It does this by using Clinical Evidence , a collection of the best research evidence for doctors. Clinical Evidence gives doctors and other health care workers a good, up-to-date summary of what's known and what isn't about treatinga wide range of clinical conditions. It's published by the BMJ Publishing Group. 2.2. Clinical Evidence looks at all the evidence and decides how well treatments work, whether the research is good enough and how serious the side e Vects are. Sometimes no one knows for certain whether a treatment works because the research that's been done isn't good enough. Or it could be that not enoughresearch has been done. 2.3. Best Health adds to the Clinical Evidence research. It makes the evidence easy to read. It also enables patients to see the same research evidence that doctors see. Clinical Evidence gives doctors and other health care workers a good up-to-date summary of what's known and what isn't about treating a wide range ofclinical conditions. It's published by the BMJ Publishing Group. 2.4. We follow a strict process to develop each topic on Best Health . Here are the key steps: 2.4.1. Step 1: Selecting a topic 2.4.2. Best Health covers serious, long-lasting illnesses that a Vect many people in the UK. It also looks at more minor conditions that a Vect a lot of people, such as coughs and colds. We are guided by national health statistics, doctors and patient groups. The conditions we look at have been included in Clinical Evidence . 2.4.3. Step 2: Asking the right questions 2.4.4. We cover the treatment options for each condition and give background information to explain the condition itself. Best Health works with the Clinical Evidence team, an international team of doctors, and patient groups to nd out what matters most to doctors and patients. They might ask questions such as:What does the research say about exercise helping people with heart failure? What are the side e Vects of treatments for childhood asthma? 2.4.5. Step 3: Finding the evidence 2.4.6. All our information is based on research evidence and high-quality medical papers. Here is how we gather this evidence: 2.4.7. Information about treatments\u2014This information in Best Health is based on Clinical Evidence. To answer each question about a treatment, the Clinical Evidence medical information specialists do a thorough search for studies that measure how well treatments work. First the information specialists look for the besttypes of studies (called systematic reviews) and other good-quality studies called randomised controlledtrials. If there are none of these studies, the information specialists look for other studies and say how muchthey can be relied on and what problems there are with the Ev 127 2.4.8. Once the research has been collected, the information specialists weigh up the evidence and take out the studies that aren't good enough. They do this using a method developed by experts in how researchis carried out.1 2 .This thorough research helps us nd out which treatments work best for a condition, andalso why certain treatments work. If you would like to read more about how we search for and select studies,see the Clinical Evidence website (http://clinicalevidence.bmj.com). 2.4.9. Information about conditions\u2014The information that we provide to explain medical conditions is based on high-quality original medical papers and textbooks chosen by our information specialists. On eachpage of the site, you will nd the details of the sources of information we have used. 2.4.10. Step 4: Making sense of the evidence 2.4.11. The research evidence for each treatment is studied and summarised by a doctor who is an important expert in a particular specialty. Each topic is then checked by at least three more doctors. Then,a leading expert provides advice on how doctors can use this research evidence. We ask people with thecondition to tell us what they think the important questions are about their condition and treatments. 2.4.12. A team of experienced medical writers makes sure this evidence can easily be understood by the general public and writes the extra information that explains each condition. 2.4.13. Deciding which treatments work\u2014We group treatments into categories according to how good the evidence is that they work. We use slightly di Verent language to describe the categories than you'll nd inClinical Evidence , but the treatments are grouped in the same way. Here is an explanation of what each category means: Category What it means Treatments that work There's clear evidence from randomised controlled trials that the treatment works. Also, the evidence shows that the chance of problemsis small compared with the benets. Treatments that are likely to There is some evidence that the treatment works. But we can't be as work certain that the treatment works as we can for those listed under \"Treatments that work\". Treatments that work, but There's some good evidence that the treatment works. But there's also whose harms may outweigh good evidence that it can have serious side e Vects. Doctors and patients benets need to weigh up the benets and risks according to what each person needs and wants. Treatments that need further We don't know if the treatment is e Vective because there is either too study little research to tell or the quality of the research is not good enough. Treatments that are unlikely to There is evidence that the treatments probably don't work. But we can't work be as certain that the treatments don't work as we can for the ones in the group \"Treatments that are likely to be ine Vective or harmful\". Treatments that are likely to be Clear evidence shows the treatments don't work or will be harmful. ineVective or harmful 2.5. Step 5: Presenting the answers All the information on Best Health is edited by a team of editors and checked by our doctors. The information about drugs has been reviewed by a team of qualied pharmacists working in association withPharmacyHealthLink. PharmacyHealthLink is a leading national charity that works to improve the healthof the public through the expertise of pharmacists and their sta V. 2.6.

Again, it seems appropriate that the committee's deliberations regarding the evidence relating to homeopathy are conducted with reference to the larger picture regarding the imperfect and emergingevidence base informing policy for commonly provided treatments within the NHS. 5. While evidence-based policy is a laudable goal, something to be strived for, it can only happen in the prevailing climate of imperfect and emerging knowledge. If, as seems likely, an unacceptable gap is identiedbetween the level of reported use of homeopathy and the evidence available to help inform the public or theNHS of its value, the most objective and ethical way forward would be to support the generation of highquality research ndings to close this gap. The current structures of the NIHR are adequate to facilitate this. 6. The above recommendations for further research echo those made in relation to homeopathy in the GO-Science Review of the Department of Health: \"[...].

D eclaration of Interest The author of this submission, Professor Katharine Thomas, is an academic researcher at the University of Leeds; she is not a homeopathic practitioner, and has no nancial interest in the provision of homeopathy. Katharine Thomas BA (Hons) MA Professor of Complementary and Alternative Medicine ResearchLeeds Institute of Diagnostics and TherapeuticsUniversity of Leeds November 2009 Memorandum submitted by Anne Waters (HO 17) 1. With very little time to prepare this submission, I would like to make the following points. 2. I would like to register my regret and concern that the amount of time allowed for this consultation is so severely limited. You call for evidence on 20 October and want submissions by 6 November. This isunreasonable 3. I would like to draw your attention to the following research, by Nobel Prize winning virologist, Professor Luc Montagnier 4. In a recent paper, Prof Montagnier, and his team report the results of a series of rigorous experiments investigating the electromagnetic (EM) properties of highly-diluted Evidence Ev 129 5. The abstract of this research in part asserts, \"A novel property of DNA is described: the capacity of some bacterial DNA sequences to induce electromagnetic waves at high aqueous dilutions. It appears to bea resonance phenomenon triggered by the ambient electromagnetic background of very low frequencywaves.\" 6. Although homeopathy is not mentioned anywhere in the article, the researchers used aqueous solutions that were agitated and serially diluted (the researchers note that the solutions were \"stronglyagitated\" and that this step was \"critical for the generation of signals\") 7. This is exactly the way that homeopathic remedies are prepared.8. The researchers found that pathogenic bacteria and viruses show a distinct Electro Magnetic signature at dilutions ranging from 10(-5) to 10(-12) (that is 10 to the negative 5th power to 10 to the negative 12thpower...corresponding to 5X to 12X) and that small DNA fragments (responsible for pathogenicity) weresolely accountable for the EM signal. 9. The researchers also noted that one experiment found signicant e Vects from dilutions as high as 10(-18) (to the negative 18th power, equivalent to 18X). The EM signature changed with dilution levels butwas una Vected by the initial concentration and remained even after the remaining DNA fragments were destroyed by chemical agents. 10. Of additional interest was the researchers' observation that they observed the SAME results whether their initial concentration of cells were just 10 or one part in 1,000,000,000. 11. The researchers also detected the same electromagnetic signals in the plasma and in the DNA extracted from the plasma of patients su Vering from Alzheimer, Parkinson disease, multiple sclerosis, and rheumatoid arthritis. 12. The researchers also quote Italian physicist, E. Del Guidice, (the same scientist who Benveniste cited), for positing that water molecules can form long polymers of dipoles associated by hydrogen bonds and thatelectromagnetic radiations that the emit enable them to avoid decay. 13. With this initial paper Prof Montagnier and his team have started a very promising line of enquiry, which has direct relevance to homeopathy as they continue to investigate the characteristic physico-chemicalproperties found in high-dilutions of biological material. Produced Aqueous Nanostructures Derived from Bacterial DNASequences. Interdiscip Sci Comput Life Sci (2009) 1: 81-90. 15. http://www.springerlink.com/content/0557v31188m3766x/fulltext.pdf16. Are you aware that cutting edge science is now recognizing that our current understanding of DNA is flawed, and that in his book The Biology of Belief Bruce H Lipton, PhD. (published by Hay House, Inc. ISBN: 978-1-4019-2311-2) states on page 55 that 17. \"because receptors can read energy elds, the notion that only physical molecules can impact cell physiology is outmoded. Biological behavior can be controlled by invisible forces including thought, as well as it can be controlled by physical molecules like penicillin, a fact that provides the scientic under-pinning for pharmaceutical-free energy medicine.\" (my bold). 18. Please look at the work of French immunologist Jacques Benveniste on the memory of water. (1988) This work was inappropriately discredited a month after publication in the journal Nature, but currentscientic knowledge now accepts that much of what Benveniste said was in fact right. 19. Evidence based medicine is about integrating individual clinical expertise and the best external evidence. The individual clinical expertise of homeopaths is dismissed as anecdotal, and so invalidated. Thisis unfair, inappropriate, and prejudicial. Patients own reports of benet are ignored. There is no will to fundfurther research, because those who control the funding are unable to think outside the box of their ownpersonal experience. 20. Good science relies on scientist who can think outside the box, and yet, good science is dismissed, because those who control the press, the policy and the decisions are those who have a vested interest incontrol, prot and outcome. 21. There is no prot in homeopathy.22. There is no control, when the public make decisions that they consider to be in their own best interests, but are against the accepted methodology, or the limited wisdom of the Technology Committee: Evidence 23. Science is very good at saying \"we used to think, but now we know\" This is evident in the way many pharmaceutical drugs have been licensed and then later withdrawn. It is evident in physics, chemistry, andbiology. Please do not approach an energy medicine such as homeopathy with a paradigm that isinappropriate. Anne Waters MA (SEN) Lakeland College of Homeopathy November 2009 Memorandum submitted by the European Committee for Homeopathic Medicine in Europe (HO 18) THE USE OF HOMEOPATHIC MEDICINE IN EUROPE: ITS LICENSING AND REGULATION. 1. Introduction 1.1 Over the past 30-40 years homeopathy has beneted from growing demand both from doctors and from the public in the majority of the European countries. According to a survey by European Commissionorder in 1996 three Europeans out of four know about homeopathy and of these about 30% use it for theirhealth care. In the European Union there are approximately 50,000 physicians who have taken a trainingcourse in homeopathy. Many more doctors in Europe prescribe homeopathic medicines without anyhomeopathic training: approximately 25-40 % of the GPs from time to time, 6-8 % of them on a moreregular basis. 1.2 Among the di Verent forms of Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM), in particular homeopathy has a form of legal recognition in certain European countries, an organisational structure atEuropean level, self-regulatory mechanisms, and a certain level of scientic credibility. Homeopathy is beingincreasingly recognised as a potential asset to European health care. Resolutions on CAM have beenadopted by the European Parliament and the Council of Europe, EU Directives oblige the Member Statesto register homeopathic medicinal products, and homeopathic medicinal products are being included in theEuropean Pharmacopoeia. Earlier this year the Swiss people in a national referendum voted in favour of a constitutional article for complementary medicine. Switzerland is the rst country in Europe to set out in the constitution, authorityfor the state and constituent states (cantons) to take complementary medicine into consideration in thepublic health service. On this constitutional basis, parliament and the authorities have to admit doctorstrained in anthroposophic medicine, homeopathy, neural therapy, herbal medicine and Traditional ChineseMedicine into the obligatory public health insurance system, and create national diplomas for CAMtherapists without a full medical education. 2. H omeopathy and the European Union 2.1 The European Parliament has taken the position that homeopathy\u2014as well as other branches of non- conventional medicine-, should be recognised. Its resolution of 29 May 1997 (A4-0075/97) called on theEuropean Commission (a) to launch a process of recognizing non-conventional medicine and, to this end, to take the necessary steps to encourage the establishment of appropriate committees; (b) to carry out a thorough study into the safety, e Vectiveness, area of application and the complementary or alternative nature of all non-conventional medicines and to draw up acomparative study of the various national legal models to which non-conventional medicalpractitioners are subject; (c) to make, in formulating European legislation on non-conventional forms of medicine, a clear distinction between non-conventional medicines which are \"complementary\" in nature and thosewhich are \"alternative\" medicines in the sense that they replace conventional medicine; and calls on the Council of Ministers after completion of the preliminary work referred to above (at b.) toencourage the development of research programmes in the eld of non-conventional medicines covering theindividual and holistic approach, the preventive role and the specic characteristics of the non-conventionalmedical disciplines; Parliament undertakes to do likewise. 2.2 As to homeopathy in veterinary medicine, the rst steps of recognition have been made. In July 1999 Council Regulation 1804/1999/EC was adopted, supplementing Regulation 2092/91/EEC byestablishing rules on organic production and agricultural products and indications referring thereto onagricultural products and foodstu Vs to include livestock production. This Regulation stipulates that, when animals become sick or injured, they should be treated immediately by giving preference to homeopathic orherbal medicinal products and by limiting to a strict minimum the use of chemically-synthesised allopathicmedicinal products in order to guarantee the integrity of organic production for consumers. 2.3 All EU Member States are obliged to register homeopathic medicines pursuant to Directive 2001/82/EC (veterinary use) and 2001/83/EC (human use)\u2014amended by Directive 2004/28/EC andDirective 2004/27/EC respectively\u2014on Evidence Ev 131 medicines are prepared in accordance with a homeopathic manufacturing procedure described in the o Ycial pharmacopoeias currently used in the Member States,\u2014the French, German, and increasingly, theEuropean Pharmacopoeia. 3. H omeopathy and the Council of Europe In 1999 the Council of Europe, in its Resolution 1206 (1999) on non-conventional medicine (%Complementary and Alternative Medicine) called on \"member states to promote o Ycial recognition of these forms of medicine in medical faculties and to encourage hospitals to use them\". In addition, theCouncil stated that \"appropriate courses should be o Vered in universities to train allopathic doctors in alternative and complementary forms of treatment\", and that \"the best guarantee for patients lies in aproperly trained profession, which is aware of its limitations, has a system of ethics and self-regulation andis also subject to outside control\". 4. H omeopathy and National Statutory Regulations 4.1 Homeopathy is recognised by law as a distinct medical therapy in Belgium (1999), Bulgaria (2005), Hungary (1997), Latvia (1997), Portugal (2003), Romania (1981), and Slovenia (2007). In some countrieswhere the government has delegated the tasks of authorisation, registration and supervision of medicalpractitioners to the national medical associations, statutory regulation has been introduced by the nationalmedical associations, ie in Austria, Germany, Romania and Switzerland. In Lithuania it was the nationalinstitute of medico-legal a Vairs that regulated homeopathy. The national medical associations in France and Italy have recognised homeopathy as a distinct medical therapy and called on the government to providethe necessary legislation. 4.2 In Latvia the medical council/chamber has recognised homeopathy as a medical specialty. In the following countries as an additional qualication: Austria, Germany, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania (almosta subspecialty), Romania, Switzerland (subspecialty for GPs, paediatricians and internists). 5. H omeopathy Teaching at Universities 5.1 Familiarisation courses about homeopathy are provided in the medical undergraduate curriculum as a part of a course on Complementary and Alternative Medicine in Hungary (one university), Italy and theNetherlands; as a separate subject in Bulgaria, Germany and Romania. These familiarisation courses areoptional for medical students in Germany, Hungary (one university), Italy, the Netherlands and Switzerland(some universities), obligatory in Latvia and Romania. Postgraduate training courses in homeopathy for doctors are provided at universities in Bulgaria, Germany, France, Italy, Lithuania and Spain, in other countries at private teaching centres. 5.2 A lectureship specically for homeopathy exists only in the Netherlands (Amsterdam), a professorial chair of CAM including homeopathy in Hungary (Pe \u00b4cs) and Switzerland (Bern). 6. H omeopathy Provision in Hospitals Several hospitals in continental Europe, in their out-patient departments, currently provide homeopathic treatment by physicians, ie in Austria (seven), France (two), Germany (ve), Spain (two), Italy (some). Dr Ton Nicolai , President of the European Committee for Homeopathy November 2009 Memorandum submitted by Professor Vincent Marks (HO 19) Government Policy on Licensing of Homeopathic Products 1. Homeopathic products have no place in a society and more especially a National Health Service that aims to protect people from unnecessary harm arising whether due to ignorance or misfeance. Homeopathyhas no justication for continuing to exist in a world where medical practice is a craft that relies upon thebasic sciences of anatomy, physiology, pathology, pharmacology and psychology and demands evidenceof eYcacy. 2. Homeopathy has none of these attributes and whilst it may have been justied because when inaugurated because it fulllled one of the prime maximes of medical practice namely, \"First do no harm..\"which was in sharp contrast to much of orthodox medical practice at the time, it no longer is so. 3. Homeopathy produces harm, in my experience and in numerous published reports,not by commission but by omission, and by the denial of access to remedies of proven benet. Licensing homeopathic remediesgives them a credibility they do not deserve or warrant from either a pragmatic or philosophical point Technology Committee: Evidence Government Policy on the Funding of Homeopathy Through the NHS 4. Evidence based medical practice should not have to compete for funds with what can legitimately be described as a cult practice based upon nothing than unsubstantiated dogma. 5. This has repeatedly been shown, through fair trials, to provide no benets beyond those achievable by diligent use of the placebo e Vect whose adantages cannot be used to full e Vect by practioners of modern medicine. 6. Registered Medical Practioners are ethically bound to explain to their patients the scientic basis of treatments they recommend and both the desirable and undesirable consequences of it. TheEvidence Base on Homeopathic Products and Services 7. I am not aware of any genuine evidence base for homeopathy whose philosophy flies in the face of all known physical, chemical and biological science. 8. The proposition that \"like cures like\" was a preposterous proposition based on nothing more profound than the imagination of its author. 9. Properly conducted randomised controlled clinical trials of homeopathy (fair trials) have not established any benet greater than can be achieved by placebo therapy and that cannot be explained bychance. 10. Claims that animals respond to homeopathy do not withstand scrutiny but are often attested to as pragmatic evidence for the e Ycacy of homeopathy in spite of its implausibility. Vincent Marks , MA, DM,FRCPath, FRCP (Edin & Lond) November 2009 Memorandum submitted by Dr Jean Monro and Dr Peter Julu (HO 20) Summary of the MainPoints being Made: 1. dilutions resemble dilutions of antigens for low-dose immunotherapy. 2. Allergy is evinced by autonomic changes which are physiologically demonstrable and measurable using the NeuroScope. 3. Low-dose immunotherapy can reverse dysautonomia. This has been demonstrated before and after depictions of physiological abnormalities. 4. Homoeopathic dilutions have been shown to mirror the provocation and nullication of symptoms in di Verent dilutions which are evinced by low-dose immunotherapy dilutions. 5. The lymphocyte sensitivity test is described. It shows sensitivity of lymphocyte membranes when exposed to agents to which the patient is sensitive. 6. Low-dose immunotherapy can stabilise lymphocyte membranes and abort abnormal cell membrane responses, hence controlling symptoms of sensitivity. 7. The ndings described have been published, in the rst instance, in a peer-reviewed publication and, subsequently as presented to the Joint International Neurogastroenterology and MotilityConference held in Chicago in August 2009. 8. Ongoing studies and observations corroborating these ndings have been undertaken and are in the process of being collated. 9. There is clear, scientic evidence of the mode of action of sensitivities, allergies through the autonomic nervous system, which is the neural pathway of allergy and its control through low-doseimmunotherapy. 10. As low-dose immunotherapy and homoeopathy are showing parallel e Vects, the ndings in relation to low-dose immunotherapy are relevant to homoeopathy. 1. In our attempt to investigate the physiological evidence of low-dose immunotherapy, we have carried out several studies which included dilution of antigens, up to homoeopathic concentrations. 36These produced symptomatic responses at some dilutions and abrogations of responses at others. Selected antigenswhich suited the individual provoking no symptoms nor increased wheals when injected intradermally, werethen used for treating patients with migraine and food allergies. Subsequently, with homoeopathic dilutionsprovided by Ainsworth Homoeopathic Pharmacy, similar responses were observed of provocation andnullication of symptoms. 36Monro JA.

Below are the graphic representations of the response to homoeopathic concentrations. SYMPTOMS TO MILK AT 3. The text in relation to these graphs is as follows: Fifteen patients were selected. Each of these patients had been previously diagnosed as being allergic to wheat, milk and egg, both by elimination diet followed by challenge which induced symptoms or observablephysiological changes, and by previous skin testing using the provocation/neutralisation method, withallopathic vaccines of 1:5 dilutions. The homoeopathic of 1x, 6x, 10x, 30x. Patients were exposed to each of these strengths within their vials, and also injected intradermally, with a 0.05 ml wheal being raised. Symptoms were noted and charted. Patients then held the vial and symptomswere noted. Where symptoms occurred, intermediary preparations of vaccines were obtained and charted.Dilutions of antigens below Avogradro's number, viz a similarto antigens injected sequentially, as in the Miller provocation/neutralisation technique and homoeopathicremedies have a similar pattern of provoking and neutralising symptoms. 4. It was then necessary to further investigate the physiological evidence of low-dose immunotherapy. This was, therefore, designed in the experimental terms of \"before and after\" evidence. This is an ongoingclinical evaluation, but due to the urgency of this call for evidence, we want to share with you our earlyresults. 5. The rst pilot study was carried out and presented to the Joint International Neurogastroenterology and Motility Conference in August 2009 this year, showing very clear physiological responses to low-doseimmunotherapy. Autonomic dysfunction was demonstrated and this was corrected by low-doseimmunotherapy. We clearly showed that low-dose immunotherapy manipulates the autonomic nervoussystem and this is the basis for its mechanism of action. For example, we showed that low-dose immunotherapy corrected dysfunction of the sympathetic nervous system in both the splanchnic regions andskeletal muscles (see illustration attached, as presented at the Joint International Neurogastroenterologyand Motility Conference 27-30 August 2009). 6. Further evidence of the mechanism of action of the low-dose immunotherapy is biochemical/ immunological. The lymphocyte sensitivity assay is a test in which lymphocytes are viewed by confocalmicroscopy on a slide in which the medium is accessible to the addition of possible agents to which thelymphocytes can react, if they are sensitive. In the medium is a calcium probe which becomes fluorescent blueif the cell wall is breached with calcium. When the person's cells are viewed initially, the amount of calcium inthe cell can be calculated by the density of the fluorescent probe. Thereafter, di Verent agents are added to slides and the lymphocyte, if it is sensitive, will allow the ingress of further calcium. This was undertakenbefore and after the use of low-dose immunotherapy and shows a normalisation of cell membranes as resultof low-dose immunotherapy. 7. These ndings are clear scientic evidence of the action of low-dose immunotherapy, and, since low- dose immunotherapy with homoeopathic dilutions has been shown to work similarly, giving parallel clinicalresults, we have no doubt that this is the mechanism of action of homoeopathic agents. 8. We have, therefore, embarked on the clinical evaluation of the physiological and chemical/ immunological mechanisms Evidence Ev 135 9. A memorandum was presented to the House of Lords Science and Technology Select Committee on Allergy, Session 2006-07, which was chaired by Baroness Finlay of Llanda V. This described the background of low-dose immunotherapy. 10. Further presentations were o Vered at a seminar organised by Breakspear Hospital Trust at the House of Commons when we were guests of Michael Penning MP Shadow Health Minister. Information that waspresented regarding allergy at that meeting can be made available to the Science and Technology Committee. Declaration of Interests : Jean Monro\u2014Director of Breakspear Medical Group LtdPeter Julu\u2014Inventor of NeuroScope November 2009 Memorandum submitted by Dr Sara Eames (HO 22) THE EVIDENCE FOR HOMEOPATHY AND ITS PROVISION WITHIN THE NHS. 1.The Faculty of Homeopathy represents over 1000 healthcare professionals in the UK who choose to incorporate homeopathy into their everyday work. Many of these members have become interested inhomeopathy because they have seen patients who have been helped by this therapy when conventionaltreatments have failed. 2.What is Homeopathy? It is well known that the choice of a homeopathic medicine is made by matching the symptoms of a patient with a substance which is known to cause those particular symptoms when taken in larger doses. What isless widely appreciated however is that the whole homeopathic consultation is a complex process and is anideal way to practice good medicine. It starts with a careful history taking, involving not only the mainproblem, but also other current problems, past medical, family and social history and factors about thepatient's physiology, interests and concerns. It is mandatory to enquire about the patient's lifestyle andidentify those factors inhibiting healing and good health. These can include poor diet and lack of or excessiveexercise as well as living in di Ycult emotional situations. The doctor will work with the patient to identify ways in which these blocks may be removed and only then will a homeopathic medicine be prescribed. Itthus becomes obvious that when considering the role of homeopathy in the management of patients it is thewhole process rather than just the action of the medicine which is to be considered. 3.What is Evidence? 3.1. The concept of evidence is multi-faceted, but in recent years it has become progressively reduced to accepting double blind trials as the gold standard. While these can be useful in assessing the e Vects of a single intervention on a single symptom or outcome, they are far less suitable when studying the overall e Vects of a holistic therapy in a complex organism with multiple problems. Notwithstanding this there have been over100 double blind trials in homeopathy with far more positive than negative outcomes. These are summarisedin the submission by my colleague Dr Robert Mathie, on behalf of The British Homeopathic Association. 3.2. There are also many other types of evidence for homeopathy:Hundreds of thousands of case histories, recording successful cases. (NICE accepts case series as evidence in its review of treatments) 3.3 Outcome studies from the Homeopathic Hospitals, show consistent results in improving not only the presenting symptoms but also overall well-being and in reducing the use of conventional medicine. [1]The majority of patients in these surveys have chronic conditions, and many have multiple pathologies. All havebeen referred to the hospitals by their GP or hospital consultants and many have not responded to previousconventional treatment. The outcome studies from the hospitals are discussed in greater detail in thesubmission by my colleague Dr Hugh Neilsen. 3.4. The Department of Health is now advocating the use of patient reported outcome measures (PROMs) as a way of assessing improvements in patients with complex health care needs.The NHS website requests patient feedback on their hospital experiences and the Royal LondonHomeopathic Hospital has very positive results. 4.How Should Evidence be Used in Medicine? It is the role of scientists to research and discover new treatments in medicine, but it is the role of the doctor to practice the art of medicine. Pure science and the results of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) are toolsin this practice, but should never become the master. A wise physician will use his wisdom and experienceto consider a range of treatment options suitable for the individual patient in their particular situation andmany conventional doctors nd that having homeopathy as an additional tool at their disposal allows themto help more patients in a safe and cost Committee: Evidence 5.The Case for and against Homeopathy. 5.1 There has been a surprising amount of negative publicity around homeopathy when one considers the tiny proportion of the NHS spending it involves and the fact that it is a remarkably safe therapy whichis both popular with and helpful for patients.There are three main strands to these negative arguments which are the dispute of the evidence from RCTs,the denial of any possibility that an ultra dilute homeopathic medicine can have any action and the publicitygiven to the few unfortunate cases involving homeopathy where there have been poor outcomes. 5.2 1. The consideration of the trial results in homeopathy is fascinating. As stated above in over 100 RCTs there are far more positive than negative results in spite of the fact that in the trials involving classicalhomeopathy, all trial participants, including those in the placebo group, will have beneted from thehomeopathic process as outlined above. This becomes even more compelling in terms of health economicswhen considering that many of the trial patients will have noticed additional improvements in other healthproblems which were not recorded as they were not included in the original trial parameters and also thatparticipants su Ver from very few, expensive to treat, side e Vects. All meta-analyses of these trials have been broadly positive, [2,3,4,5]until the last one published by Shang et alin the Lancet[6]. Critics of homeopathy have selectively accepted this outcome as the nal word in the argument against homeopathy, but it is worthnoting that Shang's work did not include many new trials and was merely a di Verent statistical reworking of the old information. Perhaps the most important conclusion from this is that responsible decision makersshould not rely on statistics alone! 5.3 It is important to note however that the Shang meta-analysis has been widely criticised for not adhering to even the very basic principles of good meta-analysis as outlined in the QUOROM guidelines. [7] 5.4 Some of the main points of the critique to be aware of include: Statisticians involved in a meta-analysis should not have prior knowledge of the subject. At least one of the authors of this study had already critiqued homeopathy although this was not declared in the conflictof interests. Enough information about trial selection must be given for the study to be reproducible, yet the article said nothing about the detailed methodology of trial selection and indeed did not even name the trials whichhad been involved.The nal conclusions of the study were based on the comparison of only eight homeopathy trials, althoughover 100 had initially been looked at. There is no clear information about how this reduction was done andthis number of eight trials was not pre-stated in the methodology as required by QUOROM. One of thechosen homeopathic trials was not even Medline listed, although most of the published homeopathictrials are. 5.5 At best this is a very poor quality meta-analysis and at worst an example of biased data dredging searching for pre-determined results. 5.6 2. The possibility of action of ultra-molecular substances is dismissed as completely implausible by critics of homeopathy, in the face of increasing scientic evidence to the contrary. This evidence has beencomprehensively listed and discussed by Dr Peter Fisher in his submission. 5.7 Some of the more intriguing results include the experiments around the concept of hormesis, where a small dose of a toxic substance will stimulate an organism, even though a larger dose will be toxic. Thereis also an ever growing group of in-vitro experiments from di Verent centres showing the blocking of basophil activity by highly diluted histamine. 5.8 It is also fascinating that both plant and animal experiments show how growth can be stimulated or reduced according to the level of dilution of the substance. While there is certainly much more to discover about the action of dilute substances, it is no longer scientically correct to say that they cannot work, with such an increasing body of scientic evidenceshowing their activity. 5.9 3. Individual cases of poor outcomes with homeopathic treatment are obviously to be regretted and may constitute personal tragedy, but they are thankfully rare and usually involve the failure to integratehomeopathy with the best available conventional treatment rather than as an e Vect of the homeopathic treatment per se . It is somewhat surprising that great emphasis and headlines are given to these individual incidents while many thousands of successfully treated patients are dismissed as mere anecdote. 5.10 There is also a great contrast with the scant publicity given to the side e Vects of conventional medicine which can produce many serious and expensive to treat complications, but which receive littlepublicity. The Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) has a series of illuminating articles onthis subject. A study at Toronto University published in 1998 found that over two million hospitalised Americans suVered serious adverse drug reactions during the 12 month period of the study and that 100,000 died as a result of these events. The gures do not include accidental overdoses or errors in administration and theyaccount for more deaths than road tra Yc Evidence Ev 137 5.11 A study at John Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health two years later found that iatrogenic disease was the third largest killer in the US behind only cancer and cardiovascular disease. It also showedthat the largest sub group of these deaths was caused by non-error adverse e Vects of medication, larger even than deaths caused by hospital acquired infections. [9] 5.12 It is also important to note that the prescription of multiple conventional drugs concurrently is frequently non-evidence based as little is known about the complicated reactions between them and the e Vect on patients overall. 6.The Funding of Homeopathy within the NHS. 6.1 The two main settings in which homeopathy is used in the NHS are in general practice and at the four homeopathic hospitals. 6.2 There have been a number of reports of outcomes of GPs prescribing for acute problems and they are all low cost prescribing practices. A recent study published by Robinson showed this and how he was ableto use the homeopathic medicines within the context of 10 minute consultations with his patients. [10] 6.3 It is interesting that some of the positive trials of specic conditions are of great relevance to commonly occurring problems in general practice and include the treatment of allergies,[11]the reduction in duration of influenza symptoms,[12]and a reduction in the duration and severity of childhood diarrhoea when homeopathy is added to conventional treatment.[13] 6.4 The topic of the Homeopathic Hospitals is discussed in the submission by my colleague Dr Hugh Nielsen, but it is important to stress their unique role and importance within the NHS. They o Ver an alternative for doctors and their patients when conventional treatments have failed or are contra-indicatedand especially when patients su Ver from multiple and chronic conditions. 7. S ummary . 7.1 Homeopathy is a branch of medicine which has an increasing evidence base, both from clinical studies and basic scientic research, which conrms the clinical outcomes reported by practitioners world-wide forover 200 years. There is naturally always scope for further study as suggested by the House of Lords CAMreport in 2000. 7.2 Homeopathy can usefully contribute to care within the NHS both in general practice and the hospital setting. By reducing prescribing costs it will help with the current economic challenges that the health servicefaces, by reducing not only direct drug costs, but also the number of expensive to treat and sometimes fataladverse e Vects of conventional medicine. It is popular with patients and can help with problems that have not responded to conventional treatment including chronic and multiple pathologies. References 1.

November 2009 Memorandum submitted by the Society of Homeopaths (HO23) 1. S ummary 1.1 The demand for Evidence Based Practice in healthcare has led to a stringent examination of evidence for all types of healthcare interventions. Decisions about what treatments are o Vered are informed by the \"best\" evidence available. However, there are many other factors that also inform this decision makingprocess such as cost e Vectiveness, safety and patient preference. In addition, policy making in health care has to adhere to ethical standards. Government policy in health care, as in all other areas of policy making,cannot be founded upon consideration of evidence in isolation. In this submission the question of e Ycacy is considered within a broader ethical framework. In particular the issue of decision making in situationswhere there is debate about e Ycacy is addressed. 2. A bout the Society of Homeopaths 2.1 Established in 1978, the Society of Homeopaths is the longest standing registering body for professional homeopaths and is now the largest organisation of its kind in Europe. The Society, withapproximately 2,500 current members, represents 65% of all registered homeopaths in the UK. 2.2 The Society has long been committed to the highest standards for homeopathy, having run a voluntary regulatory system for the last 30 years and a course recognition process for the last 15 years.Further, it was the rst homeopathy organisation to institute a Code of Ethics & Practice. Members mustmeet the stringent standards of competence for clinical and administrative practice set by the Society.Consequently our members are trained to very high academic and professional standards. Our members alsohold comprehensive insurance. 2.3 The Society is applying to the Health Professions Council (HPC) for the statutory regulation of homeopaths, following a survey in 2006 which showed that 65% of our membership supported statutoryregulation. The application coincides with the tenth anniversary of the House of Lords' Select Committeeon Science & Technology report into Complementary & Alternative Medicine (session 1999-2000), whichcategorised homeopathy as a \"Group One\" therapy along with acupuncture, chiropractic, herbal medicineand osteopathy. This report stated that, \"Under The Society of Homeopaths, the non-medical homeopathshave organised themselves well and their professional organisation should mean the transition to statutoryregulation does not present too great an upheaval.\" [1]The move to statutory regulation is seen as a natural step forward for both The Society and the profession, most importantly to o Ver protection to the public as, under existing laws, someone without training can currently practise as a homeopath. 3. A F ramework for Decision Making 3.1 Traditionally the practice of medicine has been subject to many pressures, driven not only by developing scientic knowledge, but also in reaction to social, political and nancial forces. For example,Primary Care Trusts, controlling 80% of the NHS budget, respond to the needs of their local communitieswhen making decisions about delivery of health care and health improvements to their local areas. TheNational Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE), responsible for providing national guidance on thepromotion of good health and the prevention and treatment of ill health, outline key principles underlyingNICE clinical guidelines that incorporates the following factors: \u2014 designed to promote good health and prevent ill health;\u2014 produced by the people a Vected by our work, including health and social care professionals, patients and the public; \u2014 based on the best evidence;\u2014 transparent in its development, consistent, reliable and based on a rigorous development process; \u2014 good value for money, weighing up the cost and benets of treatments; and \u2014 internationally recognised Evidence Ev 139 3.2 Government policy in health care, as in all other areas of policy making, cannot be founded upon consideration of evidence in isolation. For instance, good value for money has to be considered within thecontext of limited resources. E Ycacy plays an important role but cannot be the sole deciding factor. To do otherwise could exclude a large proportion of conventionally accepted treatments currently used within theNHS that do not satisfy the evidence standard. [3] 3.3 In addition, policy making in health care has to adhere to ethical standards. Current thinking in healthcare ethics tends to focus upon the four principles outlined by Beauchamp and Childress[4]as the foundation for ethical professional practice and these will form the point of reference for this submission.The four principles are: \u2014 Respect for autonomy.\u2014 Benecence.\u2014 Non-malecence.\u2014 Justice. The question of e Ycacy will be considered within a broader ethical framework that also takes into consideration the above four principles 3.4 Hence ve questions arise from ethical consideration of the issues to be addressed by the committee: (a) Is the intervention e Vective? (b) Is the autonomy of the patient respected? (c) Is there a prospect of benet? (d) Is there a risk of harm? (e) Is the principle of justice respected? 4.Is the intervention e Vective? 4.1 The question of e Ycacy in homeopathy often generates a highly charged debate, particularly in the UK, that has to date not yet been resolved. The following table describes some of the main issues that areoften quoted on either side of the debate. Homeopathy is e Vective Homeopathy is not e Vective Historical and case-based evidence shows the Historical and case-based evidence is not acceptable clinical e Vectiveness. as proof of e Ycacy. Observational studies (of which there are many) Observational studies do not exclude the possibility consistently report highly positive e Vects that homeopathy is no more than placebo Research methods most highly placed in the The only way to thoroughly test an intervention is evidence hierarchy of Evidence Based Medicine through a placebo controlled, randomised trial(RCTs and systematic reviews) do not adapt well tocomplex interventions such as homeopathy Inherent bias prevents a fair consideration of Bias exists on both sides and results can be evidence such that when positive results from RCTs manipulated or occur by chancein homeopathy are published they are dismissed. There is a distinct lack of funding available for Research into homeopathy should not be funded as research in homeopathy the agents cannot be e Vective in the dilutions given. 4.2 The above two positions cannot be reconciled on the position of evidence. If only evidence from RCTs and systematic reviews of RCTs is considered acceptable proof of e Ycacy, a substantial proportion of interventions currently used within the NHS violates the evidence principle.Estimates vary widely (from 11-70%) as to the exact proportion of interventions that can be evidence-basedin this manner. [3]In addition, it is accepted that in some areas of medical practice, for example surgical procedures, most practice is not evidenced through RCT research as RCTs would be unethical to conduct.Hence a major challenge for the evidence-based movement in medicine is that many areas of practice su Ver from a paucity of RCT evidence leading to the conclusion that there is \"no evidence\" for the practice onevidence databases such as Bandolier and The Cochrane Library. 4.3 This demand for RCT evidence also contradicts current World Health Organisation (WHO) policy to promote and stimulate research into and use of traditional medicines. [5]For the WHO, therefore, other types of evidence must carry some value. For example, The Complementary Medicines EvaluationCommittee has adopted the following denition of \"traditional use\" for regulatory purposes: \"Traditional use refers to documentary evidence that a substance has been used over three or more generations of recorded use for a specic health related or Technology Committee: Evidence 4.4 Typically however the greatest debate in homeopathy centres not on the issue of whether treatment by a homeopath can have positive benets, but rather it is rooted in the question as to whether or not highlydiluted remedies can have an e Vect. Sceptics variously describe homeopathy as \"water\", \"placebo\" or even \"the ultimate fake\". [7]To accept that homeopathic remedies have an e Vect would entail revision of much of our basic scientic conception of chemistry and the body.[8]Others point to a growing number of scientists around the world who are investigating possible measurable e Vects of ultra high dilutions.[9-11]These scientists include well known and respected individuals such as Luc Montagnier, Nobel Prize winner fordiscovery of the AIDS virus, who recently published a paper describing detection of electromagnetic signalsfrom highly diluted solutions of pathogenic bacteria. [12]In spite of the opinions of many sceptics scientic investigation of this nature is being undertaken suggesting that this remains an unanswered question. 4.5 Philosophers of science might tell us that what we have here is a state of underdetermination. This thesis states that any given body of evidence may support numerous, even contradictory theories, a situationthat can be exacerbated when there is disagreement about what constitutes evidence. Scientic theories areinevitably underdetermined by data, such that what counts as good scientic theory depends largely uponother factors: social and political agendas, preferences, biases and whims\u2014not the evidence itself. We cannd clear examples of underdetermination in homeopathy. Many people have carried out systematic reviewsand meta-analyses of placebo-controlled homeopathy trials in an attempt to answer the question of whetheror not homeopathy is more e Vective than placebo. [13]These studies have been drawing upon the same data sources, published trials of homeopathy, and yet they come up with conflicting and contradictory results.The same data can be used to support either the claim that homeopathy does have an e Vect over and above placebo and also that it does not have an e Vect over and above placebo. Both theories are underdetermined by the available data and the data can be used to support either one. 4.6 Hence the question arises, \"what happens when agreement cannot be reached about e Ycacy?\" Should a practice continue to be funded or should it be withdrawn? What actually happens in healthcare is thatwhere there is a lack of RCT based evidence decisions are made on the basis of other types of evidence thatmay include traditional and historical use or advice from experts etc. The treatments are not simplywithdrawn. Evaluation of existing practice can act as a crucial indicator in this scenario and results of thatevaluation are fundamental for any decision making. These questions need to be asked: \"Have the outcomesbeen measured?\" \"Is there an indication of benet?\" If the answer is yes then practice should continue butfurther research might be needed. Decisions about healthcare should not and are not based purely upon theissue of \"evidence\" in its narrowest sense. 5.Is autonomy of the patient respected? 5.1 Respect for autonomy means respecting the capacity of an individual to be self-determining, to make decisions for themselves without undue pressure, coercion or other forms of persuasion. Paternalism occurswhen actions of a health care practitioner override or do not seek the wishes of the patient, believing thatthey are better able to decide what is in the patient's best interests. Respect for autonomy implies thatpaternalism should be avoided as much as possible such that whether or not the doctor knows best, s/heshould respect the patient's own choices and wishes if possible. \"Giving people more choice is a priority of the modern NHS. This is because research in the UK and overseas has shown that treatments are more e Vective if patients choose, understand and control their care.\" [14] 5.2 The United Kingdom is a nation of well-educated individuals who are capable of making decisions about their own healthcare and it is clear that there is much choice available to them. Many studies showthat homeopathy is one of the most popular forms of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) inEurope, being practised in 41 out of 42 European countries. [15]Homeopathy is the most frequently used CAM therapy in ve out of 16 surveyed countries in Europe and among the three most frequently used in11 out of 16 surveyed countries. [16]If people are choosing to use homeopathy then the more information that is available to them to help inform decision making the better. 5.3 The labelling of the most commonly used over the counter homeopathic medications could inform decision making for individuals ensuring responsible usage of these medications. Thus labelling of a limitedrange of products should be acceptable if it does not contravene other ethical principles. 5.4 Autonomy of patient and patient choice in healthcare must be considered within light of other ethical principles such that welfare is protected. 6.Is there a prospect of benet? 6.1 Results from many studies, including an evaluation of service by practitioners registered with the Society of Homeopaths, show that many patients seek homeopathic treatment for conditions for which thereis either no conventional alternative or for whom the conventional treatment is not acceptable. [17]For example many people seek help for conditions such as Chronic Fatigue for which there is no clearconventional treatment. Women for whom Hormone Replacement Therapy is Evidence Ev 141 with symptoms associated with the menopause. The majority of patients that seek homeopathic treatment have tried conventional approaches rst.[18]The provision of homeopathy is therefore meeting the needs of a patient population who are not having those needs met elsewhere. 6.2 The results from numerous large scale observational studies around the globe demonstrate that homeopathic treatment evaluates very well. The largest in the UK to date was conducted at the BristolHomeopathic Hospital [18]. In this observational study of 6,544 consecutive patients during a six-year period, and over 23,000 consultations, results showed that 70.7 % reported positive health changes, with 50.7 %recording their improvement as better ( !2) or much better ( !3). Of the 1270 children that were treated 80.5 % had some improvement, and 65.8 % were better ( !2) or much better ( !3). 6.3 Who decides whether homeopathy is of benet? Should this be the homeopath, the doctor, the politician, the sceptic? Clearly those patients who seek homeopathic treatment on a regular basis believe thatthey benet from this intervention. 7.Is there a risk of harm? 7.1 The World Health Organisation acknowledge that, \"in general, traditional procedure-based therapies are relatively safe, if they are performed properly by well-trained practitioners\" [5]In particular studies show a very good safety record for homeopathy with little risk of harm from the remedies.[19]In contrast the number of adverse drug reactions from conventional medicines reported in 2005 in the UK was 21,234, ofwhich 5% were fatal. The NHS spends \u00a3466 million/year treating adverse e Vects from conventional medicines. [20] 7.2 Risk of harm to the patient in homeopathy arises from poorly qualied or regulated practitioners rather than the practice itself. Registered members of The Society of Homeopaths have met stringentacademic requirements, completed a registration process, hold comprehensive insurance and agreed to abideby a Code of Ethics & Practice, providing the general public with a guarantee of safety and competence. [21] 7.3 The best way to ensure patient safety is to continue to o Ver homeopathy within the NHS and to properly regulate those practitioners who work in private practice. 7.4 It is sometimes stated that patients are put at risk of harm when seeking help from CAM practitioners because this might delay them seeking help from conventional medicine.[22]In practice it is rare for a patient to seek help who has not already tried the conventional approach. In addition it is not uncommon for ahomeopath to refer a patient back to their GP. The in-depth method of consultation by a homeopath canreveal signs and symptoms that the GP may not have had time to uncover and hence treatment can act asan extra safety net rather than a potential risk. The Society of Homeopaths has a clear and transparentcomplaints procedure and registered practitioners have agreed to abide by a strict code of ethics and practice. 8.Is the principle of justice respected? 8.1 The principle of justice requires that we do what we can to ensure that costs and benets are fairly distributed. In the UK homeopathy is mostly delivered in the private sector and therefore not easilyaccessible to those who cannot a Vord to pay for treatment. Patient choice here is a Vected by a Vordability and those with less money have less choice. However, homeopathic treatment is available via the NHS insome parts of the country such that patient choice for individuals in these locations is increased in thisregard. 8.2 In considering the justice of o Vering homeopathic treatment by the NHS the relative cost of this provision must be weighed against the relative benets to the patients. In addition the issue of whether themoney that is used to provide this service could bring a greater amount of benet to a greater number ofpeople if used otherwise needs to be considered. 8.3 The total amount that is spent on homeopathy in the NHS is approximately \u00a34 million per year representing just 0.0004% of the total NHS budget. [23]What we have here is a situation where a comparatively small amount of money is being used to generate a very high level of patient satisfaction. 8.4 0.0004% of the total NHS budget is being spent on a service for patients for whom conventional approaches are either not suitable or desirable. The patients choose this service, they feel benet from theservice and there is no evidence of harm resulting from that use. It could be claimed here that adherence tothe principle of justice leads to the conclusion that homeopathic provision should be vastly increased on the NHS to ensure that benets are available to all. 9. R ecommendations 9.1 When reviewing the evidence for traditional medicines such as homeopathy that consideration be paid to a variety of di Verent types of evidence as recommended by the WHO. [5] 9.2 When reviewing the provision of homeopathy by the NHS due consideration be paid to ethical issues such as patient autonomy, safety, benet and cost-e Vectiveness and not simply the notion of evidence in Technology Committee: Evidence 9.3 When considering policy on the licensing of homeopathic products that again due consideration be paid to the ethical concerns described.

Available http://www.britishhomeopathic.org/what Evidence Ev 143 Supplementary memorandum submitted by the Society of Homeopaths (HO 23a) Re:Evidence Check :Homeopathy ,2 5N ovember 2009 I attended the above session this morning and was concerned to hear Dr Evan Harris ask questions of two witnesses that directly related to The Society of Homeopaths, without intervention or challenge fromthe Chair or opportunity from The Society itself to clarify and defend its position. For your information, The Society, as the largest body representing professional homeopaths, did ask to give oral evidence to support its written submission but was refused. Dr Harris asked Dr Fisher \"What was your reaction to The Society of Homeopath's symposium that argued that AIDS could be treated homeopathically?\" This symposium on HIV/AIDS (2007) was just that\u2014a symposium\u2014or discussion forum\u2014to look at whether homeopathy had a role to play in the treatment of patients with HIV/AIDS. At no point was thesymposium or The Society making claims that homeopathy o Vered a cure for this terrible disease. Dr Harris also spoke about disciplinary action, including striking o Vmembers from a register and referred to the 2006 undercover interviews of several homeopaths by the organisation Sense About Science. Dr Harris asked Dr Matthie whether any action had been taken against any of the ten practitioners accused of promoting \"prophylactic homeopathic anti-malarials in the absence of advice aboutconventional malarials and bed nets...avoiding being bitten.\" He continued by asking \"Should The Societyof Homeopaths take and register someone who prescribes (prophylactics)?\" I would like to advise the Committee that, in actual fact, only one of the practitioners interviewed for this programme was a homeopath registered with The Society and that after signicant delay and reluctance ontheir part, Sense About Science nally released the transcript of the relevant telephone conversation to usfor investigation. This was immediately forwarded to our Professional Conduct Department, who reviewedit and concluded that it had not breached The Society's Code of Ethics & Practice. Whilst Dr Harris is right to be concerned about the advice given to the public concerning homeopathy, it is dangerous to assume that edited material on a television programme constitutes evidence of malpractice.The propensity for trial by media must surely be replaced by an independent adjudication process whichassesses all the evidence against a clearly laid out Code of Ethics & Practice? Of greater concern should surely be the number of homeopaths in the UK who are not registered with any organisation. Currently, there is no requirement for any training at all in order to call oneself ahomeopath. This is certainly a cause for concern for The Society and I am sure, for the Select Committeealso. The Society of Homeopaths has a strict Code of Ethics & Practice, which all registered members are required to abide by. The ultimate sanction is removal from the register. Indeed, during the last two years,two members have been removed in this way. However, one of the flaws of this voluntary regulation processis that anyone removed is free to simply transfer to another register. You will be aware from our submission to the Committee (although this was not mentioned at all during today's session) that The Society is leading the call for the statutory regulation of homeopaths, through itsapplication to The Health Professions Council. It was therefore encouraging to hear universal support today for greater regulation of homeopaths. I hope, in its summing up, that the committee makes this a formal recommendation for future action bygovernment. Paula Ross Chief ExecutiveThe Society of Homeopaths November 2009 Memorandum submitted by the Complementary Medicine Research Group, University of York (HO24) About the Complementary Medicine Research Group ,University of York The Complementary Medicine Research Group is based within Department of Health Sciences, which in the 2008 Research Assessment Exercise, was rated joint rst nationally for health services research. We havea strong track record of conducting clinical evaluations of osteopathy, chiropractic, acupuncture andhomeopathy. We have ve primary aims: 1. To establish the clinical, economic and individual impact of complementary therapies for specic conditions. 2. To evaluate the safety of complementary therapies.3. To develop evaluative methodologies appropriate Technology Committee: Evidence 4. To build capacity for rigorous research into complementary and alternative medicine. 5. To disseminate the results of research in order to inform the public and influence policy and practice. We have been successful in attracting a range of funding from the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR), including a Career Scientist Award (for Hugh MacPherson at \u00a3365,000 from 2007 to 2012), a Research for Patient Benet Grant (\u00a3250,000 from October 2008 to September 2011) and a ProgrammeGrant for Applied Research (\u00a31,300,000 from 2009 to 2014). More information about our projects andpublications can be obtained from: https://hsciweb.york.ac.uk/research/public/Group.aspx?ID %4. TheContext Homeopathy is regarded with scepticism by the establishment yet it is widely used by the general public who often experience it as a useful adjunct to conventional medicinal care. While the plausibility ofhomeopathy is of concern to many scientists, its widespread use leads those of us who conduct health servicesresearch to call for more and better research into the evidence in the interests of the public good. In parallelwith the increased public interest in homeopathy is the demand to show evidence of clinical e Ycacy. While the evidence base is currently patchy for homeopathy, as it is for quite a number of conventional medicalinterventions, the imperative from the research point of view is to conduct research that reflects the wayhomeopathy is used, whether as over-the-counter remedies or with a consultation by a homeopath. Suchresearch should build on the current evidence base, which is summarised below. TheEvidence Base Since the early 1970s, there have been a total of 99 randomised controlled trials investigating homeopathy with over half of those conducted since 2000. The reports of those trials have been published in good qualitypeer reviewed journals, and the results show a mixed picture. In 44% (n %60) the studies report positive ndings, where the homeopathy treatment showed statically signicant superior e Vect compared to placebo, and those e Vects have been replicated by two or more studies in conditions of Childhood diarrhoea (individualized treatment), [1-3]Fibromyalgia,[4,5]Influenza,[6,7] Osteoarthritis,[8,9,10]Seasonal allergic rhinitis,[11,12-21]Sinusitis[22-25]and Vertigo.[26,27] There have Chronic fatigue syndrome,[28]Premenstrual syndrome,[29]Post-partum bleeding,[30]Sepsis[31]and Stomatitis[32], however, for these conditions conducted between 2001 and 2005, there has been no replication to verify the ndings. In contrast 7% of the RCTs reported negative ndings, where the homeopathy was considered to have a worse e Vect than the placebo, whilst nearly half (49% n %68) nd inconclusive results. Negative or inconclusive results have been observed for: Anxiety,[33-35]Childhood tract infection (prevention)[63,64]and Warts[65,66]. The most robust evidence presented is from several major systematic reviews of randomised controlled trials. The aim of the systematic review is to assess the quality and rigour of the individual trials that areincluded, and then compare and contrast the ndings of each and comment on the consistency orinconsistency of the ndings as a body of work. To date there are eight systematic reviews that provideevidence that the e Vects of homeopathy are beyond placebo when used as a treatment for childhood diarrhoea, influenza, post-operative ileus, respiratory tract infection and vertigo, and three providingconsistent evidence of e Vectiveness for hay fever and associated pollenitis. Future Research into Homeopathy Although there is an increasing body of trials available, the lack of independent conrmation of reported trials and the presence of conflicting results is a major limitation to homeopathy research. Furthermore thegeneral eld is bedevilled by the lack of well-designed replicable studies conducted by independent researchteams. Two key factors inhibiting current and future homeopathy research are the lack of adequate fundingand lack of well-trained homeopaths who are su Yciently qualied and interested in engaging in objective research. Of those studies that have been conducted, a common nding by systematic reviewers is the poor quality research and weak methodology. Also problematic is the lack of reporting the key components such asallocation concealment after randomisation, pre-specied outcome measures, and the reporting of attritionrates and numbers of participants withdrawing from trials. The influence of indicators of methodologicalquality on study outcome cannot be underestimated. Linde and colleagues [67]nd that studies with higher- quality scores had a tendency to be less positive than those with lower-quality scores. After discarding thelower-quality trials, however, they still found homeopathic treatment to be more e Evidence Ev 145 A common refrain among reviewers is to call for more trials and larger trials. However, it would be more meaningful to consider not only the need for more and larger trials, but for trials of more rigorous quality.Furthermore, we suggest that there should be a greater emphasis on comparisons to conventionaltreatments. There is a need for to develop pragmatic randomised controlled trials that compare homeopathyto the usual care available for the condition. For placebo controlled trials of homeopathic remediesprescribed by a homeopath, there needs to be a placebo control that adequately emulates the therapeuticrelationship. Reporting of homeopathy trials will be enhanced by the implementation of the recent \"RedHot\" [68] supplement to the widely adopted CONSORT guidelines. The RedHot recommendations support the inclusion of information on consultations, practitioners, theoretical models, and case analysis strategies.These recommendations were developed as part of our research endeavour at the University of York tofacilitate the replication of homeopathy trials and support the development of a more robust evidence basefor homeopathy.

HOMP Dr Hugh MacPherson Complementary Medicine Research GroupUniversity of York November 2009 Memorandum submitted by Francis Treuherz (HO 25) 1. I am responding to the invitation to submit material to the Science and Technology Committee of the House of Commons on the subject of homeopathy. 2. In relation to the licensing of homeopathic products and the evidence base on homeopathic products and services I wish to make you aware of one of the largest resources of literature about homeopathy. Thelibrary collection has well over 8,000 volumes from the beginnings of homeopathy to the present day, inbooks and journals. This is an invitation to members of the committee to come and study the books in myprivate library in northwest London. I have one of the largest such collections in the world. There is acatalogue and many of the books are on computer and fully searchable. 3. I am sending to the committee a copy of a book, Homeopathy: Science or Myth , by Bill Gray MD. (Berkeley California, 2000, North Atlantic Books). This book is a rst rate introduction to homeopathy andthe contents are relevant to your interests, including clinical evidence and public policy concerns. 4. I am sending to the committee a copy of a report on homeopathic work in NHS primary care: Homeopathy in General Practice , by Francis Treuherz RSHom. (Northampton, 2000, Society of Homeopaths), which I hope is of interest. November 2009 Memorandum submitted by the Homeopathy Research Institute (HO 26) Summary 1. In this report I will focus on the evidence base of the action of homeopathic preparations, more specically on the evidence coming from clinical trials, animal studies, in-vitro studies and physico-chemicalexperiments. 2. From this evidence several conclusions can be drawn: rstly, the evidence for homeopathy in clinical trials is su Ycient to warrant further research; secondly, although the mechanism of action of homeopathy is still unknown experiments on cellular system preclude the hypothesis that placebo e Vects be solely responsible for the results from clinical trials. 3. In conclusion, although the mechanism of action remains elusive, the results of scientic studies indicate that homeopathy shows physical, biochemical and clinical e Vects su Ycient to classify it as a therapeutic agent in its own right, warranting pursued clinical and fundamental research. About the Author 4. The author (Dr A Tournier PhD) is a biophysicist with training in: physics (BSc, Imperial College), theoretical physics (Cambridge, part III), the biophysics of water-protein interactions (PhD, Heidelberg)and homeopathy (Diploma, CHE). 5. Dr Tournier is currently actively involved in research as postdoctoral fellow working for Cancer Research UK. 6. Dr Tournier is also the founding director of the Homeopathy Research Institute, a charity dedicated to promoting high-quality research in the eld 149 Evidence from Clinical Trials (a)Evidence from Placebo Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) 7. With over 150 clinical trials in homeopathy to date, there have been four meta-analyses of RCTs of the eld.[1-4]All four conclude that the results of the trials cannot be attributed to placebo alone and recommend further research be undertaken in the eld. 8. Contrary to this trend, a recent comparative meta-analysis of homeopathic trial vs. equivalent trials from conventional medicine concluded in favor of placebo being the likely explanation behind the results.[5] However, its methodology has since then been heavily criticized and its conclusion deemed unreliable.[6] (b) Evidence from pathogenetic trial 9. Pathogenetic trials (or provings) lie at the heart of homeopathy practice: they are traditionally used to compile and analyze the symptoms reported by healthy individuals when ingesting a specic homeopathicremedies. These symptoms are then used in practice to cure patients with similar symptoms. This is referredto as the \"law of similars\". 11. Although early pathogenetic trials have been criticized for their lack of scientic rigour, [7]results from recent studies such as Mo 2009[8]strongly indicate that homeopathic medicines create remedy- specic symptoms in healthy volunteers. 12. While such studies are relatively inexpensive to perform, reproducing and extending such trials could conclusively answer the question \" do homeopathic remedies have a specic clinical e Vects beyond placebo? \". Evidence from Animal Studies (a)Veterinary research 10. Although homeopathy is widely used to treat animals relatively little veterinary research has been undertaken so far.[9] (b) Animal Models 11. Animal models have been used to investigate the e Vects of homeopathy in the context of immunology.[10]With over 36 publications in this eld interesting observations have been made of the way homeopathic remedies a Vect the immune system. Although encouraging results exist in the eld the present state of the research does not lead to any denitive conclusion. 12. Researchers in Austria have experimented with homeopathic doses of thyroxin (a thyroid hormone). It was found to have the e Vect of slowing down their morphogenesis into frogs. The results seem to be reproducible (ve labs), more trials need to be performed.[11] Evidence from In-Vitro Studies 13. In-vitro studies have been used to look at the e Vect of homeopathy on certain cell lines and cell types. Overall the evidence strongly suggests that homeopathic preparations have an e Vect on cell lines and on biochemical reactions.[12] (a)Basophils degranulation experiments 14. The basophil degranulation experiment was originally developed in the lab of the last Prof J. Benvenist. In this experiment human cells (basophils) are subjected to homeopathic dilutions of a specicanti-body, which triggers a phenomenon called degranulation in normal circumstances. These experiments,now widely repeated (11 high-quality publications) have reported that homeopathic preparations trigger thedegranulation process although none of the original antibody remains in the preparation. [12] (a)Cellular systems 15. In these experiments cells, such as cancer cell lines, and di Verent types of cells are subjected to di Verent homeopathic preparations. Five high-quality publications have reported e Vects in this eld.[12] (b) Molecular systems 16. These experiments measure the e Vect homeopathic preparation have on enzymatic reaction. The majority of high-quality investigations (7/9) in this eld have reported positive results.[12] Evidence from Physico -Chemical Studies 17. A number of experiments have looked at the physical properties of homeopathically prepared samples.[13] 18. NMR experiments: Five high-quality studies reported results in favour of the presence of a homeopathic e Vect using Nuclear Technology Committee: Evidence 19. More than 10 studies have looked investigated the properties of homeopathic preparations using diVerent types of spectroscopic analysis (UV, Raman, IR). Although some studies have reported interesting observations no denitive conclusion can be drawn from the current studies.[13] 20. Another set of experiments investigate the electrical properties of homeopathically prepared samples. Here again, although the interesting results have been reported, due to methological defect, no denitiveconclusion can be drawn. [13] Overall Conclusions and Recommendations 21. Of the four areas of research presented above, human clinical trials and studies on cellular system show strong evidence of the presence of a clinically relevant e Vect of homeopathic preparations. 22. Many areas of research in homeopathy are not well developed enough to provide strong evidence. However, it is of the opinion of the author that the existing evidence warrants further research. 23. Most of the current criticism of homeopathy hinges upon the fact that no adequate explanation for the phenomenon currently exists. However, it is of the opinion of the author that the present levels ofevidence are su Ycient to seriously consider the hypothesis that the e Vect of homeopathic preparations relies on novel states of matter as yet poorly understood. 24. In the present state of ignorance of the physical theory behind the phenomena, the current knowledge is based entirely on meticulously gathered empirical evidence by generations of dedicated homeopaths. Untilour theoretical understanding catches up with the empirical knowledge in the eld, research in homeopathywill rely heavily on the accumulated knowledge of practising homeopaths. 25. My recommendations are the following:26. To pursue and ensure the adequate funding of clinical research in homeopathy, making sure the practical experience of practising homeopaths is properly taken into account in designing the researchprotocols. 27. To foster basic research in homeopathy, recognising homeopathy as a potentially groundbreaking eld of research. References 1. Linde, K et al. Are the clinical e Vects of homeopathy placebo e Vects?

Dr Alexander TournierNovember 2009 Memorandum submitted by the Alliance of Registered Homeopaths (ARH) (HO 27) 1. D eclaration of Interests The Alliance of Registered Homeopaths (ARH) is the second largest registering and regulatory body for the homeopathy profession in the UK. ARH currently has nearly seven hundred qualied homeopaths onits register, and just under four hundred individuals belonging to other membership categories, such asstudents and subscribers. ARH is set up as a Company Limited by Guarantee, and is a not for protorganisation. We are committed to supporting and promoting a high standard of safe, e Vective homeopathic practice, and to ensure that quality homeopathy is available to all who wish to use it. Other ARHfunctions include: \u2014 raising public awareness of the potential of homeopathic treatment;\u2014 encouraging a high standard of education for homeopaths;\u2014 supporting the ongoing professional development of our members;\u2014 encouraging co-operation between our members and other healthcare professionals, for the benet of patients; \u2014 engaging in research, publishing and other activities that enhance our understanding of homeopathy; and \u2014 acting as an information base for the general public. 2. ARH has based our regulatory criteria on the UK National Occupational Standards for Homeopathy (NOS), and we were active participants in the recent revision of the NOS's, as overseen by Skills for Health,earlier this year. 3. B riefOverview of Homeopathy in the UK It is estimated that there are well over 3,000 practising homeopaths in the UK, of whom 2,500 are registered with a professional body. Homeopathy is one of the most frequently sought complementarytherapies, with at least 20% of patients choosing homeopathy as their treatment option each year. Access tohomeopathic treatment via the NHS is limited. There are now just four homeopathic hospitals in the UK,and a number of Primary Care Trusts (PCTs) have withdrawn funding for homeopathy altogether, or willonly refer a patient to one of the 400 GP's trained in homeopathy. Patients who choose to consult with aregistered homeopath, or want to avoid long waiting lists, have to fund their own treatment. Many patientsseek homeopathic treatment because conventional medicine has little to o Ver them, or they are su Vering from adverse reactions resulting from a conventional intervention. Although homeopathy is often soughtas a last resort when other treatment options have failed, outcomes are consistently positive, with an averageof 70% of patients reporting an improvement of their symptoms following treatment. [1,2,3] 4. Recently, there has been a campaign demanding the withdrawal of funding for homeopathy via the NHS altogether, on the grounds that homeopathy is nothing more than placebo. This assertion byhomeopathy's detractors represents a selective interpretation of the growing evidence base that exists, whichin reality shows homeopathy to o Ver an e Vective, safe, and l cost healthcare intervention. Furthermore, to withdraw homeopathy from NHS provision would deny patients the right of choice, a fundamentalcomponent of the concept of patient centred healthcare delivery, as outlined in the Department of Health(DoH) White Paper \" Our health, our care, our say: a new direction for community services \". [4] 5. C ostEffectiveness There have been a number of studies that demonstrate the cost e Vectiveness of homeopathy, but the constraints of time and word allocation only allow for a brief mention of two relatively recent examples. TheBristol Homeopathic Hospital conducted an outcome survey of over 6,500 individual patients, spanning6 years from 1997-2003, and representing over 23,000 consultations. Two papers resulted from the analysiscompiled by Dr David Spence and his colleagues, one focusing on patient outcomes, [1]and the other on cost eYciency.[5]Patients su Vering from a broad range of chronic conditions including asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, depression, irritable bowel syndrome and chronic fatigue syndrome, were treated withhomeopathy. An average of 70% of the patients surveyed experienced a signicant improvement in theiroverall health following homeopathic treatment, and this was delivered at a fraction of the cost normallyassociated with providing conventional interventions for a similar range Technology Committee: Evidence 6. A cost evaluation of the treatment of respiratory disorders, was undertaken in the Campo di Marte Hospital, Tuscany, Italy, from 1998-2003.[6]The cost of conventional drug treatment given to a group of patients su Vering from asthma and recurring respiratory disorders, was monitored for one year prior the introduction of homeopathic treatment, then compared to the conventional drug costs incurred over a twoyear period, following the introduction of homeopathic treatment. The analysis shows a reduction in drugcosts specic to respiratory disorders of over 46%, and a reduction of general drug costs of over 42% in thepatient group given homeopathy. Overall patient wellbeing also improved signicantly, a fact whichundoubtedly contributed to the reduction in drug requirements. For the patient group su Vering from asthma specically, conventional drug costs were reduced by 71% during the rst year of homeopathic treatment, compared to the group receiving only conventional medication, whose drug requirements resulted in a 12%increase in overall costs. According to a recent news release from Asthma UK, dated 21 October 2009, the treatment of asthma in the UK costs an estimated \u00a31 billion per year. The Italian study shows a cost savingon conventional drugs ranging from between 42% to 71% over a two year period. This makes the long termimplications for delivering e Vective, cost e Ycient treatment of asthma with homeopathy, highly signicant. Ad iVerent facet of the cost e Vectiveness of homeopathy will be touched on later, in relation to the prevention of infectious diseases. 7. G athering evidence There are three principal ways in which evidence is normally gathered: \u2014 the randomised, double blind, placebo controlled trial (RCT);\u2014 outcomes based evidence, which can either be clinically sourced, or patient generated in the form of a \"measure yourself medical outcome prole\" (MYMOP); and \u2014 empirical evidence, which is data acquired through direct observation, usually under controlled circumstances, where results are reported according to previously agreed protocols. There may besome overlap with outcomes based evidence. 8. T heRCT RCT's were originally developed as an appraisal tool, and were intended to support and augment evidence acquired through other, more observation based means. A number of scientists consider RCTs to representa gold standard for determining the e Ycacy of a therapeutic intervention. However, RCTs have several inherent fundamental flaws. They are designed to support/enhance a particular outcome. The results theyproduce can, either intentionally or unintentionally, be interpreted to reflect the required outcomes. RCTprotocols are founded on a number of broad generalisations and assumptions, making it di Ycult to take into account the reactions of each individual participant. Because homeopathy is a system of medicine inwhich individualisation is key to a successful prescription, gathering evidence via RCTs presents a signicantchallenge. However, a number of RCTs looking for quantitative evidence to support the e Ycacy of homeopathy, have been undertaken. In 1997, a meta analysis of data extracted from 89 clinical trials waspublished in The Lancet, [7]and concluded that the results showed the benecial action of homeopathy could not be attributed to the placebo a Vect alone. Two subsequent reviews, analysing trials from the same data set, corroborated this conclusion,[8,9]though less strikingly than the original systematic review. This highlights a problem associated with meta analyses in general, which is that the quality of the reviews under consideration determines the usefulness of the information extracted via systematic analysis. Anotherproblem may arise when (as mentioned earlier) the researcher selects the reviews to be analysed, via criterialikely to influence the outcome. Undoubtedly there is a valuable place for the RCT within scientic research,providing its limitations are fully acknowledged when interpreting the resulting data. 9. O utcomes Based Evidence A number of outcomes based trials have provided positive information relating to the e Ycacy of homeopathy as a treatment option, and their scope is broad ranging. The Bristol Homeopathic HospitalSurvey [1]is one well documented example already referenced. Another high prole study, this time considering homeopathy alongside other CAM therapies, was run as a year long pilot study in NorthernIreland, starting in February 2007. Its primary purpose was to evaluate how CAM could be e Vectively utilised in collaboration with conventional interventions provided by the NHS. The full report waspublished in May 2008, [10]and the results are very interesting. An in depth evaluation of the report entitled Northern Ireland CAM Study , by Heidi Stevenson,[11,12]concludes that the pilot was highly successful in achieving its goal; a demonstration of how CAM modalities could be integrated into the NHS, to the benetof both patients and health care providers alike. As an aside, it also produced signicant information givingcredence to the e Ycacy of CAM modalities, with homeopathy showing excellent results for the treatment of mental/emotional problems. The study provides convincing evidence regarding the e Ycacy of CAM provision, which highlights the need for further research to be undertaken in this area. Given the severenancial constraints currently faced by the NHS, and the additional burden placed on already stretchedNHS resources by an increasingly ageing population, the question to consider is \" how can the NHS a Vord not to fully utilise CAM provision in the services Evidence Ev 153 10. A research project undertaken by Nigel Hargreaves in 2003, in partnership with NORCAS, a charity oVering support to individuals with alcohol related problems, o Vered homeopathy and counselling to clients over a six month period.[13,14]Clients were given six in depth consultations with the homeopath, and their treatment was supported by regular sessions with their counsellor in between appointments. Outcomeswhere measured using MYMOPS, combined with feedback provided by the counsellors involved. Althoughthe study was small, the results were very encouraging. Participants who completed the course reported thatalcohol now a Vected their lives an average of 64% less than before commencing treatment. An additional benet from treatment with homeopathy was a reduction averaging 68% in their use of conventionalmedication, such as anti depressants, sleeping pills and anti-psychotic drugs. This reduction would probablyhave increased if the study could have been extended further, because a number of drugs have a lengthywithdrawal period. Unfortunately lack of funding did not allow for any follow ups to take place. However,setting up and undertaking the study provided a useful foundation upon which to build for future initiatives.The study, which ran on a budget of just \u00a35,000, also demonstrated that useful research into homeopathydoes not necessarily have to cost large sums of money. 11. The North Kirklees PCT Homeopathy Service, [15]was a small scale pilot project which took place from April 2001 until March 2003. Two registered homeopaths worked in collaboration with a GPhomeopath to o Ver a homeopathy service to patients in the North Kirklees Primary Care Group. Initially, patients participating in the study were o Vered six consultations with a homeopath. 287 patients were referred for homeopathy treatment, with the largest number su Vering from anxiety and depression, with the next most common complaint being \"female\" problems. Again, MYMOPS were used to gather information.About 19% of patients did not complete the homeopathy course, but those who participated to the end ofthe project gave overwhelmingly positive feedback. 93% of participants said they would recommend theservice to their friends. GPs within the PCG were also asked to provide feedback re the study, and althoughonly just over half of the GPs asked actually responded, 76% of respondees said they wanted the service tocontinue, and 40% believed it should be a priority for funding. 12. E mpirical Evidence Empirical evidence represents the collective experience of countless individuals. It is information gathered primarily via observation over an extended period of time, which is then recorded, collated and used toincrease and further develop knowledge within a particular eld. Empiricism lies at the foundation of mostof the scientic knowledge we take for granted today. Homeopathic literature is full of examples of theeYcacy of homeopathy. One spectacular example is chronicled in the ARH's Journal, Homeopathy in Practice, [16]and describes an incident which took place in Kenya in 2005. A man in a feverish condition, and clearly in a great deal of pain, presented with a seriously swollen hand. The flesh across the bridge of hishand had been eaten away, and his ngers were in danger of falling o V. Apparently he had been \"bitten\" by something some two weeks earlier. The homeopath prescribed for him, and took a photograph of thepatient's suppurating hand. The patient then left to return to his remote village, somewhere in the bush.Some months later, the patient returned. He just wanted to say \"thank-you\" to the homeopath. His handwas back to normal, apart from a tiny hole just below his third nger, which was still oozing a small amountof pus. The homeopath gave him a new prescription and took another photograph, after which the patientleft for the long trek home. The full case study, complete with photos, is included with this submission asappendix one. 13. It is worth noting that there are homeopaths all over the world, working in remote and sometimes hostile environments, treating life threatening conditions on a daily basis. These are places wherehomeopathy is the only healthcare option available. These are circumstances where the e Ycacy of homeopathy is constantly demonstrated, not in a laboratory, or as the result of a RCT purposely constructedto prove some hypothesis, but where it matters most, which is helping to relieve the su Vering of countless human beings. 14. H omeopathy and Epidemics Extensive medical records exist, recording the e Ycacy of homeopathy in the treatment of epidemics. For example, homeopathy's success at treating the Spanish flu outbreak of 1918 is well documented, especiallyin the US. The medical records of hospitals across the country consistently show a mortality rate of above28% in su Verers treated allopathically, as opposed to a mortality rate of just over 1% of those treated with homeopathy. A more detailed account of homeopathy's e Ycacy in treating the Spanish flu outbreak in the US, is documented in a report to the Journal of the American Institute of Homeopathy, entitled\"Homeopathy in Influenza\u2014A Chorus of Fifty in Harmony\". [17] 15. In 2008, a groundbreaking research study was conducted in Cuba, where homeopathy was used to prevent an outbreak of leptospirosis in 2.4 million people during the hurricane season. The results of thisremarkable experiment, yet to be published in full, were rst presented at a conference in Havana inDecember 2008. The Finlay Institute, a Cuban based research institute, responsible for the production ofallopathic vaccines, is also involved in the research and development of homeopathic products. They wereresponsible for the manufacture of a homeopathic Leptospira nosode, which was rapidly made available to populations in the three areas most a Vected by the hurricanes. The result was that following the intervention, a dramatic decrease in mortality was observed, with conrmed cases of Leptospirosis at Technology Committee: Evidence normally expected. Furthermore, there were no fatalities in hospitalized cases. This compared to several thousand conrmed cases of Leptospirosis in previous years, including some fatalities, even in populationswhere the allopathic vaccine had been used. Another remarkable feature of this study was its cost e Yciency. The Leptospirosis nosode programme had been delivered at a total cost of around US$200,00, whereas a\"normal\" vaccination programme, which would only be delivered to the most \"at risk\" population, wouldbe expected to cost in the region of US$3,000,000. The implications of these ndings to third world countries,struggling to provide e Vective health interventions at a price they can a Vord, are massive. The Finlay Institute is planning to undertake a new study on a similar scale, using a homeopathic nosode of theH1N1 swine flu virus on large cohorts of the Cuban population. The results should prove to be veryinteresting. An overview of the Leptospirosis study is included with this submission, as appendix two. [18] 16. Homeopathy and Chronic Disease Homeopathy has a long history of bringing relief and improved wellbeing to patients su Vering from chronic diseases. A number of Indian homeopaths have written extensively about their experience ofworking with chronic diseases, and as many consultations in India take place within the clinical setting ofa hospital, extensive records of medical diagnosis and response to treatment exist, to substantiate claims ofsuccessful treatment. Dr AU Ramakrishnan is well known within homeopathic circles, for his success intreating cancer. His book, A Homeopathic Approach to Cancer , [19]synthesis his experience of treating over 5,000 patients su Vering from cancer, and is generally regarded as an invaluable reference source for homeopaths in practice worldwide. 17. Homeopathy and Animal Health Homeopathy can be of considerable benet to animal health. Animals are crucial to human existence, forming an important part of the food chain Animal health and human health are inextricably linked. It isharder to cite the placebo a Vect when observing an animal's response to appropriate homeopathic treatment. Critics often claim that restoration to health results from the intention to heal the animal. Thishypotheses doesn't explain how mastitis in cattle for example, can be controlled by placing drops of aselected remedy in the drinking water accessed by the entire herd. Also, if an inappropriate remedy isprescribed, the best intentions in the world will not achieve a curative result. Homeopathy can be highlyeVective in the treatment of animals, yet surprisingly there are only about 250 vets trained in homeopathy in the UK, and of those, only a few treat farm animals. This restricts the choices available to livestockfarmers, which can have particularly serious implications for organic farmers. It potentially limits theavailability of chemical/hormone free meat available within the food chain, which in turn impacts upon thehealth and wellbeing of humans. As a result, an increasing number of livestock farmers are learning to usehomeopathy themselves to successfully treat straight forward, acute situations. ARH has published ajournal solely dedicated to exploring the potential of homeopathy in animal health, [20]a copy of which is included with this submission (will be posted separately) as appendix four. 18. I nConclusion This submission has been an attempt to demonstrate the breadth and range of available evidence which shows homeopathy to o Ver safe, e Vective healthcare. The set word limit and tight time frame has precluded a more in depth submission. ARH would like to ask the House of Commons Science and TechnologyCommittee to recommend that an investment of funding and resources is made, in order to gather moreevidence of homeopathy in practice, and undertake new research. Every practising homeopath has a wealthof valuable information contained within their case studies. The establishment of simple protocolsappropriate for undertaking a clinical audit, combined with the provision of means to systematically collateand analyse data, would be relatively inexpensive to oversee, and would reveal a wealth of information tofurther enhance our knowledge and understanding of homeopathy. Many ARH registered practitionerswould be more than willing to participate in evidence gathering studies, provided they were o Vered basic guidance and support. Currently, the annual NHS budget stands at around \u00a3110 billion, and increasingpatient demands are stretching available resources to breaking point. The inclusion of homeopathy in healthcare delivery could do much to enhance patient wellbeing, at the same time as signicantly reducing overallcosts to the NHS.

November 2009 Memorandum submitted by the Arthritis Research Campaign (HO 28) Executive Summary 1.0 Brief introduction to the organisation and the submitter 1.1 The mission of the Arthritis Research Campaign is to improve the lives of people with arthritis by: funding high quality research into the cause, treatment and cure of arthritic conditions, translating theoutcomes of research to benet patients, educating health professionals and providing information to thegeneral public. The charity was founded in 1936 and is the fourth largest medical research charity in the UKand the only charity in the UK solely dedicated to investigating arthritis in all its forms. The charity investsan average of \u00a330 million pounds every year in research, education and training. 1.2 The Arthritis Research Campaign does not receive any government or statutory funding and is therefore totally dependent on voluntary donations. Fundraising in the community is organised through acombination of voluntary fundraising branches, paid sta Vand charity shops. The charity has no conflict of interests to declare. 1.3 Professor Alan Silman, the Medical Director of Arthritis Research Campaign, makes this submission on behalf of the charity. In addition to his remit of developing and directing the research strategy for theArthritis Research Campaign, he covers the charity's educational role which ranges from patientinformation to ensuring training for all health professionals. Prior to joining the charity in 2007 he was thedirector of the Epidemiology Unit in Manchester and had research interests in several areas of rheumatology.He has published over 500 original articles and several books, including being one of the ve joint editorsof the major international reference work \"Rheumatology\" . He serves on several national and international committees which include, among others, membership of the Expert Advisory Group to the MHRA andChair of the Op Telic Health Review Board, the MoD committee responsible for overseeing research on thehealth of servicemen and women in Iraq Technology Committee: Evidence 2.0 Factual information 2.1 Some facts on arthritis: more than six million people in the UK have painful osteoarthritis in one or both knees. Prevalence increases with age with one in ve adults aged 50-59 to almost one in every two adultsaged 80 !having painful osteoarthritis in one or both knees. [1]It is thought that over 10 million people in the UK have a form of arthritis. The Arthritis Research Campaign is currently re-evaluating the prevalenceof arthritis in the UK and hopes to publish the results by the end of 2009. In terms of the cost of arthritis,research has shown that 10 million working days were lost in 2006-07 due to musculoskeletal conditions,second only to stress, depression and anxiety. [2]The cost to the UK of musculoskeletal conditions is \u00a35.7billion annually[3]and arthritis is the most common condition for which people receive Disability Living Allowance.37[4] 2.2 Arthritis and alternative treatments: over 60% of people with arthritis or other aches and pains use some form of complementary and alternative medicine[5]\u2014and claim di Verent things work for them. Under this broad heading are included care from alternative practitioners such as chiropractic and osteopathy aswell as the use of over the counter herbal and other ingested agents. Overall 46% of the UK population usecomplementary medicines at some point in their lives spending over \u00a3450 million per year. [6]People with arthritis and musculoskeletal conditions, whose symptoms are often chronic, are particularly attracted totry such medicines and therefore need guidance to help them decide if such treatments may or may not besuitable for their arthritis and associated rheumatic conditions. 2.3 An evidence-based approach to homeopathy: in February 2009, the Arthritis Research Campaign published the rst evidence-based report on the use of homeopathy and complementary medicines inarthritis using evidence from randomised controlled trials. A second report is underway on the use ofcomplementary practitioners. A section within this report, written by the Arthritis Research Campaign inconjunction with national experts, is dedicated to homeopathy, which is dened by the Society ofHomeopaths in England as \"treating like with like\" and based on an observation that symptoms of an illnessare identical to those experienced by a healthy person treated for that illness. Homeopathic remedies areproduced by a sequence of dilutions of an active substance causing similar symptoms in the belief that thiswill reduce the likelihood of harm. [7]The report is a summary of existing published studies which indicates whether or not there is scientic evidence to support the clinical e Vectiveness and safety of certain named products for people with arthritis. The report also considered issues such as biological plausibility and easeof obtaining the treatments. 2.4 A simple way of communicating the information to the general public: the Arthritis Research Campaign score medicines according to their e Vectiveness with one indicating that there is no evidence that the compound works and ve indicating that the compound is e Vective. It also grades the medicines according to safety, providing tra Yc light classications for each. 2.4.1 Based on the evidence available from clinical trials with other supporting information, the Arthritis Research Campaign categorised each medicine into one of ve categories: 1. There is, overall, no evidence to suggest that the compound works or only a little evidence which is outweighed by much stronger evidence that it does not work. 2. There is only a little evidence to suggest the compound might work. The evidence from studies in this category often come from only a single study which has reported positive results and there aretherefore important doubts about whether it works. 3. There is some promising evidence to suggest that the compound works. The evidence will be from more than one study. However there may also be some studies showing that it does not work. Fora compound in this category however we are still uncertain whether it works or not. 4. There is some consistency to the evidence, which will come from more than one study, to suggest that the compound works. Although there are still doubts from the evidence that it works, onbalance we feel that it is more likely to be e Vective than not. 5. There is consistent evidence across several studies to suggest that this compound is e Vective. 2.4.2 The research also included a categorisation of all compounds according to their safety prole. For many compounds it was not easy to do this because there was relatively little information available on safety.Where information was available, it was categorised, assuming that it is taken within the range ofrecommended doses. Compounds which are safe at the recommended doses may have serious adverse e Vects when taken at higher doses. Again, it should be emphasised that most conventional medicines have adverseeVects, some serious. However, there is generally greater information available on conventional drugs in order to determine the frequency and range of such adverse e Vects. The categorisation used was: 37Disability Living Allowance (DLA) is a benet for people who are so disabled, they have personal care needs, mobility needs or both. Claimants must be under Ev 157 TraYc light at Green Compounds with reported adverse e Vects which are mainly minor symptoms and infrequent. A classication of Green does not mean that the compound has no reported adverse e Vects and patients should check in the product information leaflet what these are. TraYc light at Amber Compounds with adverse e Vects reported as common (even if they are mainly minor symptoms) or with more serious adverse e Vects. TraYc light at Red Compounds with serious adverse e Vects reported. Patients should carefully consider these before deciding whether to take these medicines. There were some compounds on which there was very little information on adverse e Vects and it was therefore not possible to classify them. Such examples are therefore indicated by tra Yc light at Amber together with \"No information\" written alongside. 2.5 Conclusion from the review of the evidence: homeopathic remedies are widely available over-the- counter in pharmacies and health food shops throughout the UK. The mechanism of action of theseremedies is not clear. There is no evident safety risk with the use of these remedies, and interactions withother drugs are unlikely. Even though isolated reports have suggested positive e Vects of homeopathy in the treatment of bromyalgia, evidence is still not conclusive. Trials which investigated the role of these remediesin osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis yielded inconsistent results. 2.6 Relationship to Conventional Medicine: The Arthritis Research Campaign review also made clear that the e Vectiveness of homeopathic and other complementary medicines needs to be evaluated in part against that of conventional remedies for the same condition. Furthermore, as many patients take both kinds oftreatment there is a need to consider interactions both in terms of e Vectiveness and safety. 3.0 R ecommendations 3.1 That the Committee welcomes an evidence-based approach to homeopathy, (as well as other non conventional therapies available over the counter), that can be communicated directly with lay audiences,and that the Committee actively encourages further evidence-based assessments of homeopathic remediesin arthritis as well as other diseases, so that more information is available to assess any real benets fromhomeopathy. This is particularly important in chronic, progressive diseases. 3.2 That the Committee considers the straightforward 1-5 categorisation process for e Ycacy and the traYc light system for safety used in the Arthritis Research Campaign's review described above, for all areas of homeopathy, so that patients can make better informed decisions. 3.3 That the Committee agrees that the e Ycacy and safety of homeopathic and other complementary medicines available over the counter need be evaluated against the conventional remedies for the samecondition as well as potential interactions of other remedies that could be taken at the same time. 4.0 S upplementary Material Please nd attached a pdf of the report, Complementary and alternative medicines for the treatment of Rheumatoid Arthritis, Osteoarthritis and Fibromyalgia, 2009.

S ummary 1.1 Each of the homeopathic hospitals on the NHS reported clinical outcomes data from a wide range of medical complaints.[1-5]At each hospital, positive outcomes has been reported by about 70% of follow- up patients overall, pointing out the value of homeopathy to patients and the need for further researchinitiatives to investigate the positive e Vects of the homeopathic intervention in particular diagnoses. [6,7] 2. B ackground 2.1 The United Kingdom's homeopathic hospitals are located in Bristol, Glasgow, Liverpool, and London. The four have been part of the country's National Health Service (NHS) since its inception in 1948,and are sta Ved by medically qualied practitioners who possess additional training and certication in homeopathy. All units have outpatient services only, except Glasgow Homoeopathic Hospital (GHH),which has an additional in-patient service. 3. H omeopathic Hospitals Outcome Surveys and Other Studies 3.1 An observational study at Bristol Homeopathic Hospital included over 6,500 consecutive patients with over 23,000 attendances in a six-year period (Spence, Thompson & Barron, 2005). [8]70% of follow- up patients reported improved health, 50% major improvement. The most common diagnostic groups wereDermatology, Neurology, Rheumatology, Gastroenterology, Psychiatry and Ear, Nose & Throat. The besttreatment responses were reported in childhood eczema or asthma, and in inflammatory bowel disease,irritable bowel syndrome, menopausal problems and migraine. The main weakness of this study was thecrudeness of the outcome measure; the strength of the work was in its size and comprehensiveness. Furthernon-randomised research has corroborated such results in childhood eczema (Keil et al., 2008) [9]and menopausal syndrome (Bordet et al, 2008),[10]for example. 3.2 A 500-patient survey at the RLHH showed that many patients were able to reduce or stop conventional medication following homeopathic treatment (Sharples, van Haselen & Fisher, 2003).[11]The size of the e Vect varied between diagnoses: for skin complaints, for example, 72% of patients reported being able to stop or reduce their conventional medication. The study also showed that many patients seekhomeopathy because of their concerns about the safety of conventional treatment. 3.3 In a pilot study published in 2008, data from 1602 follow-up patient appointments at all ve NHS homeopathic hospitals were collected together over a one-month period (Thompson et al, 2008). [12]Eczema, chronic fatigue syndrome, menopausal disorder, osteoarthritis and depression were the \"top ve\" mostreferred conditions. The medical problems referred to the hospitals typically are chronic conditions whereavailable conventional treatments are often not e Vective. In total, the study identied 235 separate medical complaints treated at the hospitals during one month. Many patients had multiple pathologies. At just theirsecond homeopathic appointment, 34% of follow-up patients overall reported an improvement that a Vected their daily living. For patients at their sixth appointment, the corresponding improvement rate was 59%.The study showed that reported health benet may be gained more quickly in some medical conditions thanin others. The pilot ndings are informing a programme of standard setting for treatment outcomes in theNHS homeopathic hospitals. 3.4 Qualitative research carried out at GHH found that those motivated to seek this form of treatment may achieve an empathy with their homeopathic doctor that can make a positive contribution to theenablement and health change they feel as a result of their appointments (Mercer, Reilly & Watt, 2002;Bikker, Mercer & Reilly, 2005). [13,14]Patients attributed key importance to the length of consultations, the whole-person approach, being treated as an individual, and telling and having their \"story\" listened to indepth (Mercer & Reilly, 2004). [15] 3.5 An outcome survey carried out at the Liverpool department of homeopathic medicine over a 12 month period in 1999-2000 (Richardson, 2001)[16]1,100 patients were surveyed; 76.6% reported an improvement in their condition since starting homeopathic treatment and 60.3% regarded theirimprovement as major. 814 patients were taking conventional treatment for their condition and 424[52%] ofthese were able to reduce or stop conventional medication. The main conditions treated were osteoarthritis,eczema, chronic fatigue syndrome, asthma, anxiety, headaches, inflammatory arthritis and Evidence Ev 159 3.6 A further outcome study was conducted at the same department in Liverpool covering the period 2001-06 (the study is in the nal stages of preparation for publication). The study looked at 2,495 patientsof whom 72.9% reported an improvement in their condition and 57.3% rated their improvement as major.1648 patients were taking conventional treatment and 771[46.8%] of those were able to reduce or stop it. Themain conditions treated in this study were eczema, osteoarthritis, chronic fatigue syndrome, menopausalsymptoms, anxiety, asthma and depression. 3.7 A patient satisfaction survey carried out at the Liverpool department in November 2008 showed that of 132 patients questioned, 115 were very satised and 15 were satised with the service provided. 98 patientssaid that they thought homeopathy was helping their condition, 27 were unsure and two said it wasn'thelping. 4. R ecommendations 4.1 Given the patient outcomes and satisfaction it would be of immense benet to the NHS and to patients to engage in research in homeopathy and cost e Vectiveness of homeopathy in the NHS. 4.2 The outcome studies demonstrate that there are specic conditions where homeopathy is particularly useful and is an important element in improving patients' lives.

Dr Hugh Nielsen Department of Homeopathic Medicine Old Swan Health CentreLiverpool(PCT) November 2009 Memorandum submitted by the Liga Medicorum Homoeopathica Internationalis (LMHI) (HO 31) The Liga Medicorum Homoeopathica Internationalis (LMHI) was founded in Rotterdam, 10 September 1925 and was established under the terms of Swiss civil law with Geneva designated as itsregistered o Yce. 1.2 The purposes of the association are the development and securing of homeopathy worldwide and the creation of a link among licensed homeopaths with medical diplomas and societies and persons who areinterested in homeopathy. The association is exclusively devoted to non-prot activities servingphilanthropic benets. 1.3 The LMHI represents at this moment 70 countries worldwide and has approximately 10.000 members. The LMHI is therefore the worldwide biggest homeopathic medical associationrepresenting around 50 homeopathic medical associations worldwide. 2. T heUse of Homeopathy around the World 2.1 In many countries all over the world homeopathy has gained o Ycial status. It has been o Ycially recognized by the government as a system of medicine or medical specialty in the following countries: \u2014 in Central and South America (Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Ecuador, Mexico),\u2014 in Asia (India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka) and\u2014 in Europe (Belgium, Bulgaria, Hungary, Lithuania, Portugal, Romania, Russia, United Kingdom). 2.2 In some of these countries homeopathy has been integrated into the national health care systems, namely in: \u2014 Brazil, India, Mexico, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and the United Kingdom. 2.3 In India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka, the legal standing of homeopathy is equivalent to that of conventional western (allopathic) medicine, many practitioners are certied in both homeopathy andallopathic medicine, and the primary care provider for many patients is a homeopathic doctor. 2.4 In India alone there are around 180,000 homeopathic doctors, trained and educated in hundreds of homeopathic medical colleges, recognized and supported by the Indian Government. Thousands ofhomeopathic hospitals support the Indian health care system. 2.5 There are a few thousand veterinary surgeons in the world who provide homeopathic treatment to pets, food-producing and other animals. The International Association for Veterinary Homeopathy IAVHestablished minimum training standards and the requirements for teaching programmes, examinations andcontinuing education. In most EU Member States there are special homeopathic training programmes forveterinarians as well as for dentists and pharmacists. 2.6 Over the past 30-40 years homeopathy has beneted from growing demand both from doctors and from the public in the majority of the European countries. According to a survey by European Commissionorder three Europeans out of four know about homeopathy and of these about 30% use it for their healthcare. 2.7 In the European Union there are approximately 40,000 physicians who have taken a training course in homeopathy. Many more doctors in Europe prescribe homeopathic medicines without any homeopathictraining: approximately 25-40% of the GPs from time to time, 6-8% of them on a more regular basis. 2.8 Among the di Verent forms of Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM), in particular homeopathy has a form of legal recognition in certain European countries, an organisational structure atEuropean level as well as in many other countries in the world , self-regulatory mechanisms, and Ev 161 2.9 Homeopathy is being increasingly recognised as a potential asset to European health care and to many other health care systems in the world. Resolutions on CAM (or non-conventional medicine) havebeen adopted by the European Parliament and the Council of Europe, EU Directives oblige the MemberStates to register homeopathic medicinal products, and homeopathic medicinal products are being includedin the European Pharmacopoeia. In Hungary (1997) and Lithuania (1999) homeopathy is o Ycially recognized as a regular medical method by the government. 2.10 In 1999 the Belgian Parliament adopted a law with the aim to recognise some CAM modalities, including homeopathy. According to this law homeopathy is considered as an additional qualication (GPwith homeopathy, paediatrician with homeopathy etc). The Portuguese Parliament in 2003 and the Bulgarian Parliament in 2005 adopted similar laws, providing a framework for recognition of individual branches of CAM including homeopathy. The Italian Parliament is currently discussing legislation that will eventually lead to the recognition of medical qualications in homeopathy and other branches of CAM. Several National Medical Associations have recognised homeopathy as a therapeutic medical method.2.11 In Germany doctors can obtain, after passing an examination, an additional qualication \"Homo \u00a8opathischer Arzt\" recognised by the Bundesa \u00a8rztekammer. A exists in Austria where the additional qualication \"Homo \u00a8opathie\" is recognized by the O \u00a8sterreichische A \u00a8rztekammer. The Latvian Medical Association (Latvijas Arstu Biedriba), which regulates and supervises all medical specialties, conferred homeopathy the o Ycial status of a clinical specialty in 1995. 2.12 In 1997 the French Medical Association (Ordre National des Me \u00b4decins) recognised homeopathy as an existing therapeutic medical method and stated that homeopathic education should be installed atUniversities, leading to a diploma authorised by the Ordre, and that systematic information on homeopathyshould be given within the undergraduate medical curriculum. 2.13 A subspecialty under the term of \"certicate of capacity in homeopathy\" has been in place in Switzerland since 1998 in collaboration with the Swiss Medical Association FMH, for doctors holding atitle of a current specialty such as General Medicine, Internal Medicine or Paediatrics. 2.14 In some countries, such as France, Germany, Poland and Spain, homeopathic education is provided at universities as well as at other training institutes. In France at eight universities (Aix-Marseille, Besanc \u00b8on, Lille, Paris-Bobigny, Bordeaux II, Germany at ve universities (Berlin,Du\u00a8sseldorf, Hannover, Heidelberg, and Freiburg), in Poland at seven universities (Warsaw, Poznan, Krakow, Katowice, Lublin, Gdansk, and Wroclaw), and in Spain at four universities (Barcelona, Murcia,Sevilla and Valladolid). In all other European countries homeopathy is taught in private training institutes.2.15 Several hospitals in Europe, in their out-patient departments, currently provide homeopathic treatment by physicians, ie Austria (7), France (2), Germany (5), Spain (2), Italy (some). There are vededicated public sector homeopathic hospitals in the United Kingdom. 2.16 The LMHI has been also adviser to the World Health Organization (WHO) in regard to several working projects: WHO Guidelines: Quality for Safety of Homeopathic MedicinesWHO Report Homeopathy: Overview and Analysis of Clinical ResearchWHO Guidelines for Homeopathic Education According to the World Health Organisation WHO, traditional medicine(TM) and complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) account for a major part of the health care provided worldwide. The WHOin 2002 drew up its report \"Traditional Medicine Strategy 2002-05\", describing its rst global strategy ontraditional and alternative medicine, which provides a framework for policy to assist countries to regulatetraditional or complementary/alternative medicine (TM/CAM) to make its use safer, more accessible to theirpopulations and sustainable. 3. H omeopathy and Scientific Credibility 3.1 Homeopathy is rooted in experiment and careful observation. In fact, the earliest systematic study of the action of medicines in medical history is the homeopathic pathogenetic trial\u2014also called proving.Homeopathic pathogenetic trials are a type of research, in which compounds are tested on healthy humanvolunteers in order to observe as many e Vects as possible, at a non-toxic level. 3.2 Over the 200 years of its existence a large amount of documentation particularly case studies has been published on the curative e Vects of homeopathic medicines. Further, research in homeopathy takes place in the areas of Clinical Research (on patients), and Basic Research (in 4. H omeopathy :AS afeTreatment Homeopathy is safe. Unlike other medication, homeopathic medicines are non-toxic and harmless and do not have any adverse side e Vects. Patients unable to use conventional prescription drugs due to side e Vects can often safely use Homeopathic medicines. Homeopathic medicines are natural, prepared from minuteamounts of herbs, minerals and animal products. Their quality and safety are assured by the nationalmedicine agencies based eg on European Union legislation and European Pharmacopoeia requirements aswell as on the national requirements in other countries of the world. 5. H omeopathy :AL ow-CostTreatment Homeopathic medicines are much less expensive than conventional prescription drugs, because they are generic, non-patented and non-patentable medicinal substances, produced at low costs. On average,homeopathic medicines cost less than 1 per day in acute conditions and a few cents per day (sometimes a fraction of a cent) in chronic conditions. The long-term gain has been demonstrated by several research studies. They show that patients who were treated with homeopathy used fewer medications, had better health, fewer days o Vsick, fewer visits to medical specialists, less time in the hospital than patients of conventional physicians. Moreover, there areno costs associated with complications due to adverse medication e Vects. In other words, homeopathy may oVer signicant cost savings to public health bodies, and to the economy more widely. On account of the just mentioned advantages of an homeopathic treatment (Low-cost, high e Vectivity and safety) the Government of Thailand recently introduced homeopathy in their health care systemproviding also\u2014at a university level\u2014a full Homeopathic training for their medical doctors according tothe Homeopathic Medical Education Standards from the LMHI. It remains to mention that some health insurances in Europe o Ver the reimbursement of homeopathic treatments. In Germany eg, all PRIVATE Insurances reimburse the fees for the consultations with ahomeopathic MD, as well as the costs for homeopathic medicines. Also several PUBLIC Insurances made contracts for reimbursement for the fees for homeopathic consultations with the GERMAN ASSOCIATION OF HOMEOPATHIC MEDICAL DOCTORS. Thatmeans all homeopathic doctors being members of this association and having completed the three year longhomeopathic training program for medical doctors are able to take part of these contracts and receive anadequate reimbursement for their work. Dr Ulrich D. Fischer PresidentLiga Medicorum Homoeopathica Internationalis November 2009 Memorandum submitted by Dr Clare Relton (HO 32) Summary 1. This submission proposes that there is clarity in the key terms used in the inquiry: \"homeopathy\" and \"evidence base\". 2. \"Homeopathy\" is a term with multiple meanings which include: (a) Therapeutic system of homeopathy (b) Homeopathic products/medicines/remedies/pillules (c) Homeopathic services/treatment by a homeopath (d) homeopathy: (i) Principle of Similars (\"like cures like\") (ii) Principle of Minimum Dose 3. If understanding in this area is to progress, then the precise meaning of the term \"Homeopathy\" (a, b, c or d), should be stated. 4. Evidence base: there are many di Verent types of evidence. We must be clear as to the nature of a) the evidence called for, b) the evidence cited and c) the evidence that exists. 5. The type of evidence called for to address a question, should match the evidence that is required to address that question, ie does this question require evidence of e Ycacy, clinical e Vectiveness, cost eVectiveness, acceptability, safety..? 6. Thus each question in this inquiry will require clarication as to: (a) What aspect of \"homeopathy\" is being referred to in this question (a,b,c,di,dii)? (b) What type of evidence is required to answer Evidence Ev 163 (c) Whether the quality and the quantity of the existing evidence is su Ycient evidence to yield an answer? (d) If not, then can this evidence be produced? Defining \"Homeopathy \" 7. Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) Terms were developed by the United States National Library of Medicine in order to index articles in Index Medicus and MEDLINE in order to provide a standardised wayto describe diseases, symptoms, treatments, drugs etc. http://www.nlm.nih.gov/cgi/mesh/2007/MB cgi 8. The MeSH term for \"Homeopathy\"describes it as: \"A system of therapeutics founded by Samuel Hahnemann (1755-1843), based on the Law of Similars where \"like cures like\". Diseases are treated by highlydiluted substances that cause, in healthy persons, symptoms like those of the disease to be treated. The dilutionsare repeated so many times that there is less than one molecule per dose and it is suggested that benet is fromthe energetic life force of the original substance.\" (National Library of Medicine, 2007). The term \"homeopathy\" here is used to refer to: (a) the \"system of therapeutics\"\u2014Therapeutic System (b) doses\u2014homeopathic products, medicine, pillules. in addition to these meanings, the term \"homeopathy\" is also used to refer to: (c) Homeopathic services/treatment by a homeopath (d) One or more of the Principles of homeopathy: (i) Principle of Similars (\"like cures like\") (ii) Principle of Minimum Dose 9. As a consequence of these multiple possible meanings, ambiguity in the use of the term \"homeopathy\" is common. The term \"homeopathy\" is often used to denote two or more di Verent meanings in the same conversation or article. Conclusions drawn from research on one aspect of homeopathy (eg homeopathicmedicines/products) are then applied to another meaning of the term (eg the therapeutic system ofhomeopathy). This confounding of meanings is most obvious in systematic reviews of \"homeopathy\" [1],[2],[3] and reviews of systematic reviews of \"homeopathy\"[4],[5]. For example, in a review entitled \"A systematic review of systematic reviews of homeopathy\"[4]where the primary evidence reviewed are systematic reviews of trials of homeopathic medicines, the author switches between the \"homeopathic medicines\" \"homeopathy's... two principles\" , resulting in confusion as to what conclusions might possibly refer to. 10. The lack of di Verentiation between the various possible uses of the term is further perpetuated by \"homeopathy\" being the only MeSH term available for searching the research evidence of homeopathy. Itis of fundamental importance to distinguish between the multiple possible meanings of the term\"homeopathy\". We propose that the MeSH term \"homeopathy\" has additional subheadings to helpdiVerentiate various aspects of the therapeutic system of \"homeopathy\": \" homeopathic medicines\", \"treatment by a homeopath\", \"the principles of homeopathy\" etc and that these are used in the reporting of research eg \"RCT of the e Ycacy of homeopathic medicine/product for ...\" or \"An observational study of treatment by a homeopath\" Defining \"Evidence \" 11. Two common types of evidence called for are evidence of e Ycacy or e Vectiveness: (a) Evidence of e Ycacy is interpreted as meaning that \" the treatment o Vers therapeutic benets greater than placebo\" [6]. Evidence of e Ycacy requires from placebo-controlled randomised controlled trials (RCTs). (b) \"E Vectiveness\" refers to the extent to which a treatment improves the outcome for patients in practice. Evidence of e Vectiveness requires pragmatic RCTs (which compare a treatment to treatment as usual rather than to a placebo) and well conducted observational studies of routineclinical practice which uses that treatment. 12. Evidence called for: The editor of the Lancet called for NICE to evaluate \"homeopathy\" [7]\u2014an o Ver which was declined by the Department of Health. Professor Born and colleagues called for \" evidence of eYcacy\" in their letter to the Director of NHS commissioning, ie, evidence that the treatment o Vers therapeutic benets greater than placebo. However is it evidence of e Ycacy or is it evidence of e Vectiveness that is required to justify NHS spending? 13. Evidence required: Since 2002 NHS Primary Care Trust commissioners have been required to follow guidance from National Institute for Clinical Excellence[8](NICE). This guidance is primarily based on clinical and cost e Vectiveness. Cost e Vectiveness is calculated by NICE using cost Technology Committee: Evidence estimates the ratio between the cost of a health intervention and the benet it produces in terms of the number of years lived in full health by the beneciary. From an NHS commissioning perspective the primaryquestion is one of clinical e Vectiveness and cost e Vectiveness\u2014benets and costs\u2014rather than e Ycacy. Leading Complementary and alternative medicine researchers [9],[10],[11]concur with NICE on the importance of establishing evidence of e Vectiveness before seeking evidence of e Ycacy. 14. NHS spending on \"homeopathy\": With an estimated 120,000 visits to homeopaths in the NHS annually and an NHS expenditure of \u00a33.3 million,[12]what is this \u00a33.3 million being spent on? The total NHS spending on homeopathic medicines (products) does not amount to more than 5% of this total amount, thebulk of the cost of \"homeopathy\" in the NHS is the cost of homeopathic services\u2014treatment by/consultations with homeopaths and the infrastructure to facilitate this. Thus the evidence required to informthe debate regarding NHS spending on \"homeopathy\" is largely evidence of the clinical and costeVectiveness of treatment by a homeopath, homeopathic services. 15. Does this evidence exist? The following paragraphs explore the evidence cited, dividing this evidence into two types: experimental and observational. 16. Experimental evidence is derived from situations where subjects have been randomly assigned to one of two or more groups, for instance in a randomised controlled trial (RCT). The experimental evidence basecomprises published reports of trials, systematic reviews of RCTs, meta-analyses of RCTs and reviews ofsystematic reviews. 17. Since 1940, over 150 RCTs of \"homeopathy\" and 26 systematic reviews of \"homeopathy\" have been published. [13]The majority of RCTs have compared a homeopathic medicine/product to a placebo\u2014thus providing information on the e Ycacy of homeopathic medicines/products. Only 14 RCTs compare homeopathic medicine to orthodox treatment and thus provide information on the comparativeeVectiveness of homeopathic medicines. 18. However the majority of NHS \"homeopathy\" is delivered by a homeopaths. Van Hootegem [14]in relating the case of a 23 year old woman with chronic fatigue syndrome who was cured with a course of\"homeopathic\" treatment states: \" the action of the homeopathic medicine was intimately woven with the relationship I had with her as a therapist. It is impossible to separate these two influences\" 19. Thompson and Thompson [15,16]have used qualitative research to identify what might be the \" active ingredients\" of the homeopathic approach. Through a process of direct observation and modelling in a real world context, they attempted to \"identify the components of the intervention and underlying mechanisms by which they will influence outcome\". Six putative active ingredients were identied which might contribute to the e Vectiveness of homeopathic care: patient's openness to the mind body connection, consultational empathy, in depth enquiry into bodily complaints, disclosure, the remedy matching process, homeopathic remedies. Other authors have discussed the di Yculties of separating out the e Vects of the homeopathic medicine from the consultation e Vects.[17,18] 20. I suggest that until there is clarity as to the active ingredients in homeopathic treatment and how such ingredients relate to each other, treatment by a homeopath needs to be viewed as a complex intervention[19] (which includes homeopathic medicines/products). Thus, assessment of the e Vectiveness of \"homeopathy\", should not separate out the component parts of treatment by a homeopath\u2014instead \"homeopathy\" shouldbe assessed as a package of care as it is delivered. 21. Observational evidence: In addition to experimental evidence, there is a large body of observational evidence. The observational evidence base consists of observational studies (of groups of patients) and casestudies (single or case series) of treatment by homeopaths. There are 22 !observational studies (12 conducted in the NHS) [20,21,22]which report the outcomes of 15,703 patients receiving treatment by a homeopath. In addition there are several hundred thousand published single case reports[23]the majority of which exist in the \"grey\" literature (just 507 single case reports/series are available in online databases). Thisbody of literature provides an evidence base as to the clinical e Vectiveness of treatment by a homeopath (not homeopathic medicines/products per se ). 22. The research methods used to collect observational data mean that this evidence is vulnerable to substantial biases (regression to the mean, patient selection bias, outcome measurement bias. [20]Individual case studies are often vulnerable to other forms of additional bias: observer bias, recall bias, and analysisassessment bias. Any bias may exaggerate or deflate the true e Vect of the treatment. Since observational evidence is prone to many types of bias, observational evidence is regarded as weaker than experimentalevidence, and has been disregarded in systematic reviews of evidence (though NICE commissionedsystematic reviews now include observational evidence). Recommendations 23. The precise meaning of the term \"Homeopathy\" should always be stated ie (a) Therapeutic system of homeopathy (b) Homeopathic services/treatment by a homeopath (d) Principles of homeopathy: (i) Principle of Similars (\"like cures like\") (ii) Principle of Minimum Dose 24. The type of evidence called for to address a question, should match the evidence that is required to address that question, ie does this question require evidence of e Ycacy, clinical e Vectiveness, cost eVectiveness, acceptability, safety..? 25. If quality and the quantity of the existing evidence is insu Ycient to yield an answer, then means to provide this evidence should be sought. References 1.

Dr Clare Relton PhD (Health Services Research), FSHom November 2009 Memorandum submitted by Homeopathy: Medicine for the 21st Century (H:MC21) (HO 33) Introduction 1. Karl Popper stated that: ... the belief that we can start with pure observation alone, without anything in the nature of a theory, is absurd ... Observation is always selective. It needs a chosen object, a denite task, aninterest, a point of view, a problem. [1] Any evidence in the eld of health, therefore, should be considered in relation to the \"point of view\" whichprovides its context. In particular there is a need to ensure that scientically valid denitions are used, anda theoretical framework capable of being tested scientically. 2. A distinction also needs to be drawn between the use of science and technology. [2]The use of modern technology may not mean that a eld is scientic, whilst scientic theory may be able to predict resultswithout being wholly capable of explaining the details of how the results are achieved. TheEmpirical Approach 3. The practice of conventional clinical medicine uses technologies derived from scientic elds, but it operates within an empirical one: Clinical practice must not be regarded as applied biological medicine, and it is necessary to adopt the empiricist approach for the solution of clinical problems . [3] 3.1. The denition of illness . Disease categorisation is based on the following approach: Doctors have studied millions of sick people, and we must imagine that no two of these were ever completely identical as regards their clinical pictures and the underlying causal mechanisms, butin order to build up a medical science, it was essential to stress the similarities rather than thediVerences. [4] Though empirically useful, this is not scientically sound, because: 3.1.1. Disease denitions change over time as symptomatology and causative processes are better understood. For example, the illness of pneumonia is now categorised as eleven illnesses.[5] 3.1.2. Some diseases are essentially individual, or \"idiopathic\".[6] 3.1.3. Research and clinical evidence indicate that di Verences in individuals a Vect treatment (see 4.3). 3.2. The denition of e Vectiveness . There is no scientically \"intention to means that \"e Vectiveness\" is dependent on what symptomatology is chosen. 3.2.1.1. There is an arbitrary division into \"desirable\" e Vects and side e Vects, despite the fact that the true eVect of the drug is the combination of these. 3.2.1.2. Changing the \"intention to treat\" changes the denition of \"desirable\" e Vects and side e Vects, and so changes the \"e Vectiveness\", as in the case of Viagra.[7] 3.2.1.3. The severity of side e Vects in clinical practice can lead to the withdrawal of a treatment shown to be \"e Vective\" in trials. 3.2.2. The time-scale of trials may be insu Ycient for establishing the e Vects of a treatment. 3.2.2.1. E Vects which lie outside the time-frame will only be identied from clinical practice. 3.2.2.2. The \"e Vectiveness\" of drugs can be redened as a result of experience in clinical practice, as in the case of Aspirin.[8] 3.3. Theory of health and disease . The absence of a theory means that processes of change in health cannot be distinguished from each other, such as: 3.3.1. The \"natural course\" of the disease from a course a Vected by treatment.[9] 3.3.2. The e Vect of a \"placebo\" from that of a curative agent. 3.3.3. Improvement in one part of the body cannot be readily and systematically related to symptomatology in other parts of Evidence Ev 167 Evidence -based Medicine 4. In the face of these problems, medical practitioners have devloped the system of evidence-based medicine (EBM). This involves three elements, none of which is su Ycient by itself as a basis for successful medical practice (our emphases): Evidence-based medicine is the conscientious, explicit, and judicious use of current best evidence in making decisions about the care of individual patients. The practice of evidence based medicinemeans integrating individual clinical expertise with the best available external clinical evidencefrom systematic research. By individual clinical expertise we mean the prociency and judgmentthat individual clinicians acquire through clinical experience and clinical practice. Increasedexpertise is reflected in many ways, but especially in more e Vective and e Ycient diagnosis and in the more thoughtful identication and compassionate use of individual patients' predicaments,rights, and preferences in making clinical decisions about their care. By best available externalclinical evidence we mean clinically relevant research, often from the basic sciences of medicine,but especially from patient centred clinical research into the accuracy and precision of diagnostictests (including the clinical examination), the power of prognostic markers, and the e Ycacy and safety of therapeutic, rehabilitative, and preventive regimens. External clinical evidence bothinvalidates previously accepted diagnostic tests and treatments and replaces them with new onesthat are more powerful, more accurate, more e Ycacious, and safer. Good doctors use both individual clinical expertise and the best available external evidence, and neither alone is enough. Without clinical expertise, practice risks becoming tyrannised by evidence,for even excellent external evidence may be inapplicable to or inappropriate for an individualpatient. Without current best evidence, practice risks becoming rapidly out of date, to thedetriment of patients. [10] 4.1. Care of the individual . The purpose of medicine is successful treatment of the individual, so evidence of what is successful in individual cases is essential. One method of acquiring this information is outcomestudies, but these cannot provide information enabling the development of new treatments. 4.2. Clinical expertise . Practitioners can acquire experience which enables them to assess the di Vererent eVects of treatments across a range of individuals, and to target treatments based on that experience. The problem is that this knowledge is rarely quantied, let alone rigorously quantied, and therefore it is liableto be subjective. 4.3. External clinical evidence . Evidence about treatments gathered from RCTs can o Ver some degree of objectivity about treatments, but it cannot provide reliable information about the appropriateness of aspecic treatment to a particular individual. Thus: There was still no guarantee that a treatment that had succeeded during a set of trials would cure a particular patient ... [11] As a result RCTs alone cannot enable medicine to full its primary purpose. RCTs are also dependent on ascientic framework if they are to produce valid results. 4.3.1. RCTs can successfully produce reliable evidence of the harmful e Vects of a treatment because: 4.3.1.1. A scientically valid denition of outcome is simply the increase in morbid e Vects or mortality rates. 4.3.1.2. Issues of homogeneity and generalisability are irrelevant since everyone is a Vected by harmful interventions, with only the extent and rapidity of harm being individual. 4.3.2. Evidence from RCTs cannot prove e Vectiveness because: 4.3.2.1. Curative processes are fundamentally individual, and so tests which generate statistical likelihoods of success are not valid in an individual case (see 4.3). 4.3.2.2. There is no scientic denition of e Vectiveness (see 3.2 V.). 4.3.2.3. A scientically valid denition of e Vectiveness is complex, as it needs to take into account all the outcomes of treatment and over a signicant time-scale. 4.3.2.4. The mismatch between the denitions of diseases and their actual appearance in individuals leads to a conflict between \"homogeneity\" and \"generalisability\" (see 3.1 V.). 4.3.3. Since RCTs gather evidence in the absence of a scientic theory, the evidence cannot be checked against predictions based on a consistent theoretical framework, but only against other evidence gatheredin the same flawed conditions. Consequences of Evidence without Theory 5. Using an approach which is not based on a scientic framework, but which attempts to balance diVerent sources of unreliable evidence in order to develop more reliable solutions, means that there can be no certainty as to whether the correct balance has been achieved. In addition, none of the three aspects hasscientic validity in its own right, and any tendency towards dominance of one aspect over the others Committee: Evidence render the approach valueless. This is a growing tendency among opponents of homeopathy who insist on giving undue (even exclusive) weight to RCTs over other sources of evidence.[12,13,14]As a general attitude this would lead to: 5.1. A tendency for practitioners to ignore and fail to report adverse reactions in clinical practice on the grounds that there is nothing in the trial literature. 5.2. A tendency for long-term e Vects to go unidentied, including increases in chronic illness (as in the analogous case of cigarettes and lung cancer). There are indications that this is occurring: The cost of the National Health Service nearly trebled from 1951 to 1975 (at 1950 prices); both the consultation rate in general practice and the hospital admission rate rose, and the waiting listsbecame longer and longer. In Denmark the experience was the same...Obviously this growth has many aspects, but it must be admitted that it is di Ycult to register the benecial eVect in the available health statistics. The average expected life-span has not changed much, and hospital waiting lists have not been eliminated. [15] 5.3. Additional NHS personnel and nancial costs of managing the adverse reactions. 5.4. Additional cost of research into new treatments for new illnesses.5.5. Lost work days, and consequent costs for employers and the economy.5.6. Potential increases in disability pension costs.5.7. Deaths, entraining emotional trauma and other costs. Homeopathy 6. There are further issues which mean that it is particularly inappropriate to apply this evidence-oriented process to homeopathy. Denition of what is to be treated. 7. Homeopathy uses a scientically valid denition of disease. 7.1. The understanding of what is to be treated is based on the actual signs and symptoms of the individual in their totality. [16] 7.2. The understanding of what is to be treated takes into account the chronological relationships of conditions in the individual.[17] 7.3. Homeopathy organises this information on the basis of general principles, distinguishing the relative importance of the signs and symptoms on the basis of: 7.3.1. Severity and pain, which indicate urgent need in all systems of medicine;7.3.2. Peculiarities, which indicate the individual curative reaction and so the specic remedy needed; [18] 7.3.3. Location;[19] 7.3.4. Chronology.[20] Testing of remedies. 8. Homeopathy recognises that as no two unique substances can have identical e Vects on the human organism, so each must be tested for its pattern of action.[21]As a result: 8.1. Homeopathy was the rst medical system to gather as complete evidence as possible of the action of each substance on the human body.[22] 8.2. Homeopathy was the rst medical system to test substances on healthy people prior to their use, in order to avoid the distortions inevitable in tests on sick people.[23,24] 8.3. Homeopathy was the rst medical system to seek to identify those peculiarities of the e Vects of each substance which enable one to be distinguished from another.[25] Application of remedies. 9. With full information about what is to be treated and about the available medicines, there are only three theoretical possibilities for relating one to the other: 9.1. If there is no relationship between the bodies of information, then there is no possibility of a science of medicine. 9.2. The bodies of information can have no consistent relationship as opposites, because some conditions have no opposite, but are either present or absent (for example, a cough, pain, delusions). Again there is nopossibility of a science Evidence Ev 169 9.3. Relating the bodies of information on the basis of similarity is possible, and so makes a science of medicine theoretically possible. This theoretical position is evidenced in practice, as in the case of cinchona(and its derivative quinine) which has been used for hundreds of years in the treatment of malaria eventhough the symptoms of quinine poisoning (cinchonism) closely resemble those of malaria. [26] Homeopathy uses a scientic approach to treatment. 10. On this basis homeopathy uses a scientically valid approach, and conrmation can be seen in that: 10.1. Homeopathy was developed using the scientic method, employing experiment and observation to test and articulate its theoretical framework. This can even be seen in the inaccurate and incompletedescriptions of opponents of homeopathy. [27] 10.2. Homeopathy was the rst medical system to recognise the importance of micro-organisms in disease, some 60 years before Koch identied the cholera bacterium.[28] 10.3. Homeopathy was the rst medical system to recognise that these micro-organsms could evolve, some 30 years before Darwin published On the Origin of Species .[29] 10.4. Homeopaths promoted hospital hygiene, some 50 years before Florence Nightingale.[30] 10.5. Homeopaths promoted public hygeine before the start of the nineteenth century,[31,32]and the medical historian Simon Szreter has identied this as the primary factor in disease reduction at the end ofthat century. [33] 10.6. Homeopathy was the rst medical system to identify a role for biophysics.[34] 10.7. The principles of homeopathy are capable of being tested scientically, as there is a consistent theory linking selection of a treatment and analysis of the results of treatment. Furthermore: 10.7.1. The general principles are derived from clinical experience (see 7.3 V.). 10.7.2. Individuality is incorporated into the theory (see 7.1 and 7.3.2).10.7.3. It is possible to determine what is treatable at a given point in time (see 7.3.4).10.7.4. The results of treatment, even in individual cases, can be measured against the general principles (known as Hering's \"Law of Cure\"), [35] 10.7.5. Di Verent outcomes can be distinguished from each other, and an objective assessment of eVectiveness obtained.[36] 11. It is possible to produce evidence for the e Vectiveness of homeopathy, but the mechanisms which have been used o Ver conflicting results. Randomised Controlled Trials. 12. Homeopathic principles can provide a scientic basis for RCTs to test e Vectiveness because: 12.1. Homeopathy can consistently dene the conditions being treated.12.2. Homeopathy can consistently dene expected outcomes.12.3. There is no problem with individuality in homeopathic treatment, and so no conflict between homogeneity and generalisability. 13. However, if a homeopathic RCT does not conform to the integrated whole of homeopathic principles, it will produce inaccurate results. [37] 13.1. There are at least eleven factors which can a Vect the results of the trial, and even reduce the therapeutic intervention to a placebo intervention.[38]These include: 13.1.1. Inappropriate denitions of what is being denitions of outcome.13.1.3. Inappropriate timescales.13.2. In practice RCTs produce ambiguous results. Moreover, positive trials are accused of being \"implausible\", [39]a \"stitch-up\",[40]too small, or insu Yciently rigorous, where rigour' refers to adherence to an evidence-oriented trial structure rather than to scientic adherence to homeopathic principles.[41] Meta-analyses. 14. Because meta-analyses are based on clinical trials, and because they tend to use the same approach to rigour, they o Ver no improvement in terms of evidence. 14.1. The Linde analysis (1997) was reworked (1999) as a result of criticism based on the demands of evidence-oriented rigour.[42] 14.2. The Shang analysis (2005) also dened the rigour of the trials they selected without Committee: Evidence 14.3. These analyses show that a signicant degree of subjectivity is introduced into the research process using this method.[44] 15. In practice meta-analyses also produce ambigiuous results, but the arguments usually focus on the selection criteria.[45,46,47,48] Outcome studies. 16. Outcome studies of homeopathy present very di Verent results from RCTs. 16.1. The Get Well UK study in Northern Ireland showed health improvements in 84% of patients with GP correlation for 65% of patients.[49] 16.2. The Bristol Homeopathic Hospital study showed positive change in 70.7% of patients, with 50.7% recording their improvement as better ( !2) or much better ( !3).[50] 17. Outcome studies also measure \"e Vectiveness\" in a di Verent area of the EBM model. 17.1. They assess the e Vect of \"care of the individual\" and of \"clinical expertise\" (see 6 V.). 17.2. They do not constrain the treatment process, and so do not a Vect the scientic integrity of this process. 17.3. Their results can be compared with the general tendency in the population to recover (or not) from such conditions. 18. Typically outcome studies show that substantial numbers of patients derive benet from homeopathic treatment, and often to a substantial degree. Clinical practice. 19. Both historical and present-day evidence of homeopathy in clinical practice reflects the results seen in outcome studies. 19.1. A typical example is a cholera epidemic in London in 1854, when patients at the London Homoeopathic Hospital had a survival rate of 84 per cent, compared to just 47 per cent for patients receiving more conventionaltreatment at the nearby Middlesex Hospital. [51] A mortality rate of 16% (at the homeopathic hospital) is unachievable without medical intervention, whilst53% (at the conventional hospital) is typical without treatment. [52,53] 19.2. A number of similar cases have been compared.[54] 19.3. Homeopathy has also recently been used as a prophyactic for leptospirosis in over 2 million people in Cuba, dramatically reducing infection and mortality rates.[55] Conclusion 20. Conventional medicine relies on an model known as Evidence Based Medicine which balances bodies of evidence in order to minimise the risks of harm. Within this model no form of evidence can provide adenitive statement of e Vectiveness. Attempts to limit the approach used and allow one form of evidence to dominate will defeat the object of this model. The model is an implicit (and often explicit) recognition of thefact that medicine has no underlying scientic theory. 21. Homeopathy has an underlying scientic theory. This theory is consistent with observed facts, it has led to analyses decades in advance of other medical practice, and it has a strong body of evidence ofsuccessful practice. On this basis it is entirely inappropriate to use the EBM model to assess its practice, letalone a single element of that approach. Instead it should be tested by relating its clinical practice to thepredictions of its theory, as would be the case in any other eld of science. Homeopathy requires a ScienceBased Medicine model.

November 2009 Memorandum submitted by the European Central Council of Homeopaths (HO 35) Introduction to ECCH: The European Central Council of Homeopaths was established in 1990 and is the professional platform representing the homeopathy profession in Europe. Among its 27 nationalprofessional associations in 23 countries it counts three members in the UK, the Alliance of RegisteredHomeopaths, the Homeopathic Medical Association and the Society of Homeopaths. 1.Government policy on licensing of homeopathic products 1.1 Homeopathic Medicinal Products (HMPs) are available over the counter (OTC) and on prescription in all EU Member States. They are an increasingly important part of the European pharmaceutical market. [1] 1.2 HMPs are subject to the provisions of EU Directives on pharmaceutical products for human use[2,3]. As a member of the European Union, the UK is bound by the provisions of these directives to regulateHMPs on the UK market. 1.3 The idea that because HMPs are diluted they are safe and do not require regulation is a na \u00a8ve misconception. HMPs are derived from a wide range of mineral, plant, zoological and microbial products,many of which are potentially toxic in their raw state. While the homeopathic manufacturing process knownas \"potentisation\" renders all HMPs safe and of no toxic risk once a certain dilution level has been passed,the fact that some source materials are of potential risk during the early part of the manufacturing processmeans manufacturers' premises and processes have to be strictly regulated according to standard GoodManufacturing Practice (GMP) in order that there is no risk to workers in the premises or risk of toxicmaterial remaining in the nal product placed on the market. 1.4 Normal licensing policy for placing a pharmaceutical product on the market requires evidence of quality safety and e Ycacy. Homeopathic treatment using single HMPs is normally individualised according to the whole symptom picture of each patient su Vering any diagnosed condition. Consequently, to prove eYcacy for any single HMP for any particular condition as is normally required for conventional pharmaceuticals is extremely di Ycult. The current licensing policy of only requiring proof of safety and quality for single HMPs as outlined in Article 14 of the EU directive 2001/83/EC therefore makes pragmaticsense, particularly given the low-risk non-toxic state of HMPs once potentised. Evidence for the range ofsymptoms that each single HMP is capable of addressing is available through the extensive \"homeopathicmateria medica\" that is available for single HMPs. 1.5 Complex HMPs and any other HMPs for which manufacturers wish to make therapeutic claims should be subject to the normal requirements for evidence of proof of e Ycacy as for conventional pharmaceuticals as detailed in Article 16 of EU directive 2001/83/EC. 1.6 Within the EU the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) is perceived by homeopathy stakeholders, and other national licensing authorities, to have a proportionate andpragmatic approach to the licensing of HMPs. We consider it essential that the MHRA should continue toadminister the regulation of HMPs within the UK in the present manner, not least as an example of bestpractice for other Committee: Evidence References 1.

G overnment Policy on the Funding of Homeopathy through the NHS 2.1 Homeopathy has been funded through the NHS from its inception in 1948. Throughout that time the cost of homeopathic treatment has been an extremely small percentage of the NHS's overall budget. Yet,when emerging evidence from recent studies into the provision of homeopathy in the NHS is taken intoaccount, the benet to patients who've had homeopathic treatment would seem to be substantial and worthyof more consideration than it has received up until now. 2.2 Whether provided by GPs themselves, through GPs delegating patients for treatment by homeopathic practitioners or through referral to homeopathic doctors in the outpatient units of the homeopathichospitals there is a range of evidence in existence showing that homeopathy provided through the NHS iseVective, highly appreciated by patients and capable of improving patients health overall. [1,2]. There is also evidence from outside the UK that homeopathy provided in general practice has short and long-termbenets on patients' health. A large German cohort study showed sustained improvement in patients' healthover an eight-year period [3]. 2.3 GPs are the recognised gatekeepers to NHS services and it is they who should continue to decide whether to refer patients for homeopathic treatment. They make their decisions on the basis of perceivedpatient need, within the constraints of their practice budget and, hopefully, in consultation with theirpatients. The element of therapeutic choice is an important priority in current NHS policy and themaintenance of homeopathy as a viable treatment option for patents and GPs is an important example ofthis principle being maintained and developed. There are a range of \"e Vectiveness gaps\" involving conditions where conventional approaches are either relatively ine Vective or simply do not exist and where homeopathy has been shown to be e Vective. [4-13] 2.4 The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) recently published guidance on the treatment of low back pain that recommended consideration among other interventions of the use ofacupuncture and manipulative therapies. [14]This landmark recommendation was based on the fact that conventional medicine has a limited potential for intervention in this condition and there is a range of evidence, including but not totally reliant on RCTs, to support the use of the therapies such as acupuncture, osteopathy and chiropractic as e Vective interventions before considering more drug and surgical intervention. This pragmatic approach to the evaluation of evidence is one we consider should be appliedto the consideration of homeopathic treatment where the range evidence available, including RCTs, presents a far more convincing case for its use than the simplistic criteria of whether su Ycient RCTs alone exist to support it.

DE TESTIMONIO On the evidence for decisions about the use of therapeutic interventions THE HARVEIAN ORATION Delivered before the Fellows of The Royal College of Physicians of London onThursday 16 October 2008 by Professor Sir Michael David Rawlins MD FRCP FFPM FMedSci 3. T heEvidence Base on Homeopathic Products and Services 3.1 The evidence for the therapeutic action of homeopathic products The central controversy surrounding HMPs, and the one that has dogged homeopathy for two hundred years, relates to whether (a) HMPs have an action and (b) what the nature of that action is. MathematicallyHMPs potentised above a level of dilution synonymous with Avogadro's Number do not contain anymolecules of the source material of the medicine ie they are not having a molecular action in the wayconventional pharmaceuticals do. Yet potentised HMPs above this dilution are commonly used withapparent e Vect in homeopathic practice and have been used in research trials that have produced results indicating a positive action. Furthermore, there is an accumulating body of evidence from a variety ofresearch areas within and outwith homeopathy that high dilutions of source materials appear to have ameasurable e Vect. [1-14]While we may therefore actually be approaching a point where it can be established that potentised medicines have an action, the mechanism of action may take a little longer to elucidate. 3.2 The e Ycacy of homeopathic treatment The e Ycacy of homeopathy has been considered through a large number of clinical trials of varying methodological quality. The overall results of these trials have been evaluated in a number of literaturereviews and meta-analyses. [15-22]Seven out of eight of these reviews/analyses found results in favour of homeopath. The eighth study which did not nd an e Vect in favour of homeopathy, Shang et al,[22]has since been severely criticised by scientists and researchers around the world for its poor methodology. The authorsrst claimed that their conclusions were based on 110 homeopathy trials compared to 110 trials ofconventional medicine. It was subsequently shown that they had based their conclusions on just eighthomeopathy trials compared with six conventional trials only. When re-analysing the data of this study,researchers found that homeopathy had a signicant e Vect beyond placebo, and the conclusions drawn by the original authors were highly influenced by one single trial. [23]Moreover, the researchers found that the overall quality of homeopathy trials was signicantly higher than in the conventional trials.[24](Note: It is interesting to note that a number of critics of homeopathy have particularly referred to the Shang trial tosupport their position, where, if they had they taken a more objective viewpoint they should have spottedthese methodological faults themselves.) 3.3 The e Vectiveness of homeopathic treatment The e Vectiveness of homeopathy has been considered in a number of observational studies, including a six year study of over 6,500 patients treated in a University Hospital Outpatient clinic in the UK, with over23,000 consultations, where over 70% of patients reported positive health changes, and more than 80% of1,270 children experienced an improvement. [25]In another study of almost 4,000 patients treated by 103 primary care practitioners, 97 % su Vered from chronic complaints lasting an average of 8.8 years.[26] Signicant improvement in most complaints was recorded, as well as improvement in patients' quality of life. 3.4 The cost-e Vectiveness of homeopathy The issue of the cost-e Vectiveness of homeopathic treatment can be addressed through comparing the direct costs of the treatment itself with conventional treatments and through calculating savings in potential futureother care. A number of studies have demonstrated the cost e Vectiveness of homeopathy. There is enough evidence from these studies to show that homeopathy does o Ver potential real cost savings in spending on conventional medicines, referrals to consultants and GP consultation time. Technology Committee: Evidence 3.5 The safety of homeopathy Homeopathy is a safe treatment.[40]The potentisation (serial dilution and succussion) of HMPs means that beyond four dilution stages of 1:10 their source materials are rendered safe without risk of toxic side e Vects to patients. This is recognised by the EU directive 2004/27/EC that permits simple registration for single HMPSdiluted one part in 10,000 or more. The only possible toxic risk would come from the use of certain sourcematerials in tinctures and dilutions below one part in 10,000 or from poor manufacturing procedures leavingtoxic residues in potentised medicines. The other element of safety relates to the appropriate education and professional regulation of those who practise homeopathy. As with all healthcare professions, the education and regulation of those practisinghomeopathy should convey a clear awareness of the boundaries of competence and responsibilitysurrounding their practice. Anyone o Vering any form healthcare must be appropriately educated and submit to professional regulation through registration with a recognised professional association. 3.6 The use of homeopathy Homeopathy is practised throughout Europe. [41]Homeopathy is the most frequently used CAM therapy in ve out of 14 countries in Europe, and one of three CAM therapies most frequently used in 11 out of14 countries. [42,43]According to the World Health Organization homeopathy is practised worldwide and it is provided within national healthcare systems in several countries.[44,45] As an example a poll carried out in Norway in 2001 showed that 52% of the population were of the opinion that homeopathy should be a part of the public health service there.[46]Half of all Norwegian nurses think homeopathy should have a place within the public health service[47]and half of all medical doctors are willing to recommend patients to a homeopath.[48] 3.7 Meeting the costs of homeopathic treatment Expenses for CAM therapies including homeopathy are currently reimbursed through the national healthcare service in eight countries in Europe. Expenses are reimbursed through private insurancecompanies in 12 countries. [49] References 1. Chaplin M.

Reimbursement of Expenses for Homeopathic Treatment in Europe, An ECCH Report, European Central Council of Homeopaths April 2008 Stephen Gordon General SecretaryEuropean Central Council of Homeopaths November 2009 Memorandum submitted by Judith Ford (HO 38) I am emphatically enthusiastic about homeopathic products and have taken them since 1982. I was given the wrong thyroid medication which nearly killed me and caused me to have cancer and heart operations in the nineties. I am now receiving the correct thyroid medication and vitamins and minerals and strong homeopathic medication. From an homeopathic vet who treats humans as their animals thrive. Homeopathy does work and has kept me alive these thirty years.Please consider homeopathy as it is inexpensive and e Ycacious to the patients whereas allopathy kills its patients. November 2009 Memorandum submitted by the Prince's Foundation for Integrated Health (HO 41) Introduction 1. The Prince's Foundation for Integrated Health was founded in 1993 at the personal initiative of HRH The Prince of Wales to promote integrated healthcare for all. HRH remains its President but has no directinvolvement in the Foundation's day to day operations. It is a registered Charity and has no commercial,nancial or other vested interests in complementary or alternative products or services. 2. Integrated healthcare encompasses two concepts. First, it means treating patients as whole human beings with bodies, minds and spirit, and understanding that whatever a Vects one part a Vects all three. Secondly, it is about integrating those complementary and traditional modalities which have evidence ofclinical e Vectiveness with conventional healthcare, providing that is in the patient's best interests. The Foundation does not suggest that is necessarily the case for all medical conditions or for all patients. 3. The Foundation is clinically led by a group of Fellows and Clinical Leads. They include medical scientists and scientists from related elds together with practising clinicians from a number of healthcareprofessions including medicine, pharmacy, nursing and physiotherapy. Some Fellows are also researchersand practitioners of complementary medicine. This document reflects their advice. 4. The Foundation's interest in homeopathy is focused on the question of clinical and cost e Vectiveness: whether or not it provides any benet to patients and, if can be established that it does, for which conditionsand which patient groups at Ev 179 Government Policy on Licensing Homeopathic Products 5. The licensing of homeopathic products in the UK is governed by the Medicines Act (1968) and by European legislation, in particular EU Directive (2001/83/EC)/ 6. The task of implementation is carried out by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) for whose expertise the Foundation has the highest respect. Currently the rules providetwo ways in which homeopathic products may be registered. The Simplied Scheme in which no medicalclaims or indications for the product are permitted although the safety and quality of the product must bedemonstrated. The National Rules Scheme, introduced in 2006, does allow homeopathic medicinal productsto be registered with indications for the relief or treatment of minor and self-limiting conditions, with fullinformation on safety and quality together with appropriate product labelling and product literature. Inaccordance with current pharmaceutical legislation, evidence must be provided that the product is used asa homeopathic treatment for the indications identied. 7. The Foundation has complete condence in the judgement of the MHRA as to the benets for public information and safety of the current system. TheEvidence Base 8. Homeopathy is a system of medicine, developed in Germany in the late eighteenth century, that is based on the idea that \"like treats like\": a substance taken in small quantities will cure the symptoms it would causein large quantities. In homeopathy, the idea of the small quantity has resulted in extreme dilutions of thesubstance. In some homeopathic products, not even a single molecule of the original substance remains inthe diluted medicine prescribed to the patient. These concepts are not supported by modern science and,indeed, run counter to it. 9. Unlike much pharmaceutically based conventional medicine, treatment is individualised so that patients presenting with the same diagnosis may be prescribed di Verent medicines depending on their personal histories, diet, and other factors. Homeopathy rejects the notion that mind and body are separate(a concept that was also developed in the eighteenth century) and insists that there is continual interactionbetween them. In this at least, modern science would tend to agree. 10. Homeopathy is highly controversial. From our current understanding of the physical and biological sciences, any specic mechanism of action based on extreme dilution is implausible and regarded asunsupportable by the majority of scientists working in this eld, although a small number disagree. Theevidence from randomised controlled trials (RTCs) is less than convincing. 11. Nevertheless, there is some evidence of clinical e Vectiveness of the whole homeopathic package: that is, the consultation and the medicine combined. As a consequence the Foundation nds it di Ycult to dismiss the experience of patients who say they have beneted from homeopathic treatment. Providing it is deliveredby trained and statutorily regulated health professionals such as doctors, homeopathy is safe and low cost.However, there are anxieties about the safety of practice by unregulated, non-medically trained homeopaths. NHS F unding of Homeopathy 12. Homeopathy is one of a number of complementary therapies that are provided by the NHS as an adjunct to treatment in palliative care and for a range of chronic, benign conditions. A signicant numberof patients report that they benet from homeopathy. However there is a need for controlled research studiesto establish: \u2014 whether and what benet is provided; \u2014 the extent of that benet, if any;\u2014 how the risk/benet evaluates against conventional medical interventions; and\u2014 the mechanism of action that produces benet, if any. 13. It would then be for the National Institute of Clinical Excellence (NICE) to evaluate the evidence and reach a decision as to whether the NHS should continue to fund homeopathy treatments. InConclusion 14. The Foundation wholeheartedly supports evidence based practice (and, indeed, practice based evidence). That should include evidence, where possible, of the e Ycacy of a treatment as well as evidence of its clinical and cost e Vectiveness and safety. 15. We are mindful that many patients who are treated with homeopathy are those for whom no e Vective evidence based disease specic treatment is available. That may be because no such treatment exists or isprovided by the NHS for their condition, for example bromyalgia and some forms of arthritis, or becausethe recommended treatment is contra-indicated, for example, the patient is a pregnant woman or there is arisk of drug interactions in cases of multiple morbidities. The health service should not abandon thesepatients but rather support research into how to improve Evidence Evidence Check :Homeopathy The Prince's Foundation for Integrated Health is grateful to the Committee for the opportunity to provide the attached submission for its Evidence Check into homeopathy. The Committee may be interested to know of two publications from the USA Institute of Medicine (IoM) that may relate to its discussion of homeopathy and, in particular, to the Foundation's evidence: \u2014Initial National Priorities for Comparative E Vectiveness Research was published 30 June 2009. The US Congress has committed \u00a31.1 billion dollars for comparative e Vectiveness research (CER) and tasked the IoM to recommend national priorities for research questions to be addressed. \u2014Integrative Medicine and the Health of the Public was released 4 November 2009 and provides a summary of the IoM/Bravewell Collaborative summit on integrative medicine, held in Februarythis year. This included thorough discussion of evidence for integrative medicine. November 2009 Memorandum submitted by the Science Council (HO42) 1. The Science Council welcomes the House of Commons Science and Technology Committee's scrutiny of Government policy and the emphasis the Committee continues to place on the need for a stronglyevidence-based approach to policy. 2. The Science Council was established by Royal Charter in 2003 with the object to advance science and its applications for public benet. It is a membership organisation for learned and professional bodies acrossscience and its applications and works with them to represent this sector to government and others. TheScience Council also promotes the profession of scientist through the Chartered Scientist designation andthe development of codes of practice. In addition the Science Council supports a range of activities toincrease awareness of the role of both science and scientists in society. 3. The Science Council has agreed a denition of science as follows: Science is the pursuit of knowledge and understanding of the natural and social world following a systematic methodology based on evidence. 4. Scientic methodology includes data collected through objective observation or measurement; testing hypotheses through experiment and benchmarking; deduction and induction to establish general rules orconclusions drawn from data, examples or evidence; critical analysis of evidence; critical exposure toscrutiny, peer review and assessment leading to verication, testing and repetition. 5. The Science Council is far from clear that current Government policy relating to homeopathy is based on evidence that meets such systematic criteria. November 2009 Memorandum submitted by Jackie Rowe (HO 43) I have been passionate about homoeopathy since the early 80's, and I am now aged 58. Homoeopathy has kept me out of my overstretched GP's surgery a good while. I rarely see him, having successfully usedhomoeopathy for various illnesses including chronic backache, the menopause and flu/cold viruses. My daughter however, was being treated by her GP for asthma. Improvement was minimal. Therefore, I took her to my homoeopath who gave an excellent remedy. Please do consider homoeopathy without delay. November 2009 Memorandum submitted by the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) (HO 44) 1. Introduction 1.1. The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) is grateful for the opportunity to provide evidence to the Science and Technology Select Committee review into homeopathy. The ASA is happy for thissubmission to be published and to give evidence, if called. 1.2. The ASA is the UK self-regulatory body for ensuring that all advertisements, wherever they appear, are legal, decent, honest and Ev 181 2. E xecutive Summary 2.1. The protection of consumers is at the heart of the ASA's work. The rules we administer aim to ensure high standards in advertising, by ensuring that advertisements do not mislead, harm or o Vend. 2.2. This response provides \u2014 A summary of the UK advertising self-regulatory system.\u2014 Details on how the ASA regulates advertisements for homeopathy. 2.3. Relevant rules, guidance for non-broadcast advertisers, and summaries of two recent rulings are included in full in the Annexes. 2.4. We do not have any recommendations for the Science and Technology Select Committee in this area. There are robust regulations in place for advertising and the low level of complaints indicates that there isno great consumer concern in this area. 3. A dvertising Self-Regulation in the UK 3.1. More detailed information about the ASA can be found on our website www.asa.org.uk. The website also contains a searchable database of all our adjudications from the past ve years. 3.2. The ASA is the UK body responsible for regulating advertising in all media. It does this by enforcing the UK Advertising Codes, which are written and maintained by two industry bodies, the Committee ofAdvertising Practice (CAP) and the Broadcast Committee of Advertising Practice (BCAP). 3.3. The ASA accepts complaints from the public and industry about ads that seem to have breached those Codes. It also conducts other activities such as providing training and advice, and proactivelymonitoring ads in order to keep advertising standards high. 3.4. The system is based on a concordat between advertisers, agencies and the media that each will act in support of the highest standards in advertising. Compliance with the Codes and ASA adjudications isbinding on all advertisers. It is not a voluntary system. 3.5. The system is entirely funded by industry, through a levy of 0.1% on display advertising space and airtime and 0.2% on Royal Mail Mailsort contracts. The levies are collected by two arm-length fundingbodies, the Advertising Standards Board of Finance (Asbof) and the Broadcast Advertising StandardsBoard of Finance (Basbof). 38Last year the ASA was awarded \u00a38 million to run the system. 3.6. The system is both self-regulatory (for non-broadcast advertising eg press, poster, cinema, online) and co-regulatory (for TV and radio advertising). 3.7. The Codes sit within a legal framework, which means that, where appropriate, they reflect the standards required in law, eg the Consumer Protection for Unfair Trading Regulations 2008 (CPRs) formisleading advertising. The Codes also contain additional protections that are not required under law egrules related to taste and decency and social responsibility. 3.8. Notably for homeopathic treatments, the Advertising Codes sit within the strict legal framework that regulates medicines. EC Directive 2001/83/EC (as amended by EC Directive 2004/27/EC) on MedicinalProducts For Human Use regulates medicines. Only products that have data to show that they have amedicinal e Vect can obtain a Marketing Authorisation (from the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency or the European Medicines Agency) and only products that hold a marketingauthorisation may be advertised as a medicine in the UK and make medicinal claims, in line with theproduct's Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC). 3.9. The Traditional Herbal Medicinal Products Directive, 2004/24/EC will, by 30 April 2011, allow traditional herbal products to have their traditional use acknowledged in the market place. By 2011alltraditional herbal medicinal products must be registered or removed from sale. Such products will be ableto advertise their traditional use, but may not make e Ycacy claims. 3.10. The ASA deals with more than 26,000 complaints per year. Just one complaint can cause the ASA to launch an investigation and remove an advertisement, if the ad is found in breach of the Codes. 3.11. The Committee of Advertising Practice (CAP) and the Broadcast Committee of Advertising Practice (BCAP) are the industry committees responsible for writing and maintaining the AdvertisingCodes. 3.12. CAP writes and updates: \u2014 The British Code of Advertising, Sales Promotion and Direct Marketing (\"the CAP Code\"), which governs non-broadcast advertising (eg print, 3.13. BCAP writes and updates: \u2014 The BCAP TV Advertising Standards Code.\u2014 The BCAP Radio Advertising Standards Code.\u2014 The BCAP Code on Text Services.\u2014 The Rules on the Scheduling of Television Advertisements. 3.14. Final adjudications on investigations are decided by the ASA Council and published on the ASA website. The Council's membership incorporates two-thirds members of the public, one-third advertisingexperts and is independently chaired by the Rt Hon the Lord (Chris) Smith of Finsbury. 3.15. In the event that the ASA upholds a complaint against an advertisement, the advertiser or broadcaster is required to amend, withdraw or schedule the advertisement appropriately. 3.16. Advertisers that breach the Code face nancial loss from having an ad campaign pulled and loss of reputation through the publication of upheld adjudications. 3.17. The vast majority of advertisers comply with ASA rulings straightaway. For those advertisers who refuse to comply, industry and other pressures can be brought to bear. For example, pre-vetting can beimposed and direct marketing companies can have benets such as Royal Mail bulk-mailing discountsremoved. In serious and persistent cases of non-compliance advertisers can be referred to the OFT (formisleading advertising) and broadcasters can be referred to Ofcom. Referrals are rarely required. 3.18. The system places a lot of importance on helping advertisers to get their ads right before they are published, through education and pre-publication advice. 3.19. For broadcast advertisements, the broadcasters have set up pre-clearance bodies: Clearcast for TV, and the Radio Advertising Clearance Centre (RACC) for radio. These bodies clear ads before they go onair and are very e Vective at maintaining high standards. However, pre-clearance does not prevent the ASA from investigating or upholding a complaint about a broadcast advertisement. 3.20. It would be impossible to pre-clear the many millions of non-broadcast advertisements that appear every year in the UK. However, CAP o Vers pre-publication advice for non-broadcast advertisers through its Copy Advice team and providing comprehensive online guidance. 39 3.21. The total number of ads about which the ASA receives complaints accounts for less than 1% of all advertising published or broadcast in the UK. The ASA also monitors ads to check levels of compliance andhave non-compliant ads removed. Compliance surveys regularly show that the vast majority of advertisingis compliant with the Advertising Codes. 40 3.22. The Advertising Codes can be accessed at http://www.cap.org.uk/The-Codes.aspx 4. A dvertising Homeopathic Treatments 4.1. Broadly, the Advertising Codes contain clear rules that state that advertisers must not mislead consumers, by act or omission. 4.2. The Advertising Codes also require advertisers (and broadcasters) to hold substantiation for the claims they make. The substantiation must be robust and capable of withstanding third-party scrutiny.Mandatory information which must be included can be found in the Medicines and Healthcare productsRegulatory Agency's (MHRA) Blue Guide, which can be found on the MHRA website: www.mhra.gov.uk. 4.3. As mentioned in 3.8 above products may only make medicinal e Ycacy claims in advertisements if they hold a Marketing Authorisation. Products registered as a traditional herbal product may advertise theirproduct as having a traditional use, but may not make e Ycacy claims. 4.4. Advertisements for unauthorised products cannot include medicinal or therapeutic claims or refer to a particular ailment. They may only be advertised on an \"availability-only\" basis. 4.5. This is in line with requirements of EC Directive 2001/83/EC (as amended by EC Directive 2004/27/ EC) on Medicinal Products for Human Use. 4.6. All the rules specically relating to homeopathic medicines can be found in Annex 1.4.7. The CAP Copy Advice team o Vers specic online guidance for homeopathy and this can be found in Annex 2. 39The Advice Online section has articles on advertising of therapies, and the full list of all Advice Online articles can be found at: http://www.copyadvice.org.uk/ 40The high compliance rate is often demonstrated in the various sector-specic surveys undertaken by the ASA. These surveys can be found on the ASA website at Ev 183 5. ASA A ction 5.1. The ASA undertakes investigations into advertisements for homeopathy either reactively, as a result of complaints, or proactively, through the ASA monitoring team. 5.2. The investigations we have conducted into advertisements for homeopathy focus on three areas: \u2014 the e Ycacy claims in advertisements; \u2014 the veracity of the testimonies used; and\u2014 whether an ad is irresponsible if it is likely to dissuade consumers from seeking professional medical advice. 5.3. The ASA has received 54 complaints about 50 advertisements for homeopathy in the last ve years, which led to 11 advertisements being formally investigated, all of which were upheld or partly upheld. Oneinvestigation is currently ongoing. Summaries of two recent example rulings can be found in Annex 3;however, all rulings can be found on the ASA website: www.asa.org.uk. 5.4. 30 advertisements were either not investigated because there was no problem under the Codes; saw the complaint withdrawn; were referred to CAP for compliance work (this means that we may have haddealings with the claim in the past); or were out of remit (eg the complaint related to packaging). 5.5. A further eight advertisements were dealt with informally. Informal rulings may occur if the ASA has already publicly ruled on the matter (for example with a di Verent advertiser) and if the potential breach is not considered to be materially harmful. This allows for a speedy resolution and compliance with theAdvertising Codes. However, we cannot dene the cases as breaches as they have received no formalinvestigation. Advertisers that go through the informal process are named on the ASA website. 5.6. Advertisements for homeopathy represent a very small minority of complaints and investigations. From our complaints and monitoring work, we do not consider that advertisements for such products areof signicant concern, particularly in light of the impending formal regulation of all products. 5.7. The ASA is grateful for the opportunity to provide evidence to the Select Committee. If the Committee has any questions arising from this response then please do not hesitate to contact me.

Relevant evidence should be sent without delay if requested by the ASA or CAP. The adequacy of evidence will be judged on whether it supports both the detailed claims and the overall impression createdby the marketing communication. The full name and geographical business address of marketers should beprovided without delay if requested by the ASA or CAP. 3.2 If there is a signicant division of informed opinion about any claims made in a marketing communication they should not be portrayed as generally Committee: Evidence 7.Truthfulness 7.1 No marketing communication should mislead, or be likely to mislead, by inaccuracy, ambiguity, exaggeration, omission or otherwise. 7.2 Marketing communications must not omit, hide or provide in an unclear, unintelligible, ambiguous or untimely manner material information if that omission or presentation is likely to a Vect consumers' decisions about whether and how to buy the advertised product, unless the information is obvious from thecontext. If the advertisement is limited by time or space, the ASA will take into account steps that theadvertiser has taken to make that information available to consumers by other means. 50. Health and Beauty Products and Therapies 50.1 Medical and scientic claims made about beauty and health-related products should be backed by evidence, where appropriate consisting of trials conducted on people. Where relevant, the rules will alsorelate to claims for products for animals. Substantiation will be assessed by the ASA on the basis of theavailable scientic knowledge. 50.3 Marketers should not discourage essential treatment. They should not o Ver specic advice on, diagnosis of or treatment for serious or prolonged conditions unless it is conducted under the supervisionof a doctor or other suitably qualied health professional (eg one subject to regulation by a statutory orrecognised medical or health professional body). Accurate and responsible general information about suchconditions may, however, be o Vered. 50.6 Marketers o Vering individual treatments, particularly those that are physically invasive, may be asked by the media and the ASA to provide full details together with information about those who willsupervise and administer them. Where appropriate, practitioners should have relevant and recognisedqualications. Marketers should encourage consumers to take independent medical advice beforecommitting themselves to signicant treatments, including those that are physically invasive. 50.11 Medicines must have a marketing authorisation from the MHRA before they are marketed and any claims made for products must conform with the authorisation. Medicinal claims should not be madefor unauthorised products. Marketing communications should refer to the MHRA, the authorisation or theEC only if required to do so by the MHRA. 50.19 Homeopathic medicinal products must be registered in the UK. Any product information given in the marketing communication should be conned to what appears on the label. Marketing communicationsshould include a warning to consult a doctor if symptoms persist. Marketing communications forunauthorised products should not make any medicinal or therapeutic claims or refer to any ailment. Radio BCAP C ode The Radio BCAP Code includes principles on substantiation and truthfulness, similar to those in the non- broadcast CAP Code, which can be found online. 4.13 Homeopathic Medicinal Products Advertisements for homeopathic medicines are acceptable, subject to all relevant requirements of EC Council Directive 2001/83/EC (as amended by 2004/27/EC) on medicinal products for human useimplemented in the UK by the Medicines (Advertising) Regulations 1994 (as amended). In particular: (a) advertisements are only acceptable for products which have been registered in the UK; (b) product information must be conned to that which appears in Schedule 5 of the Medicines (Advertising) Regulations 1994.Advertisements may not, therefore, include medicinal or therapeutic claims or refer to a particularailment; and (c) advertisements must include wording such as \"always read the label\" or \"always read the leaflet\" as appropriate. TV BCAP C ode The TV BCAP Code includes principles on substantiation and truthfulness, similar to those in the non- broadcast CAP Code, which can be found online. 8.2.2 Homeopathic medicinal products (a) Only homeopathic medicinal products which are registered in the UK may be advertised. (b) The only information which may be included is that which is allowed to appear on product labelling. Advertisements may not, therefore, include medicinal or therapeutic claims or refer to a particular Ev 185 Note to 8.2.2: This rule incorporates the requirements of EC Directive 2001/83/EC (as amended by EC Directive 2004/27/ EC) on Medicinal Products For Human Use. Annex 2 CAP COPY ADVICE Therapies \u2014H omeopathy This section should be read in conjunction with the entry on \"Therapies, General\". This discipline works on the principle of treating like with like, with the active ingredient diluted heavily in water. Despite its popularity, CAP understands that no scientic rationale exists for assuming that remedieslacking in pharmacologically active molecules can produce clinical e Vects and is unaware of robust evidence that proves it does. Some homeopaths seem to be medically qualied and therefore regulated by the GeneralMedical Council. Those who are medically qualied may make claims about treating conditions but only ifit is clear that the e Ycacy is due to conventional treatments. Those practitioners who are not medically qualied should not make claims about the e Ycacy of their treatments and should not refer to serious medical conditions. In July 2007 the General Media Panel considered the application of Clause 50.6. It concluded that complementary and alternative therapy practitioners o Vering signicant or invasive treatments should encourage consumers to take independent medical advice before committing themselves to the treatment. Clause 50.19 requires homeopathic medicinal products to be registered in the UK. Marcoms should refer consumers to a doctor if their symptoms persist and should not make medicinal or therapeutic claims forunauthorised products. See \"Medicines: Homeopathic Medicines\". Annex 3 TWO RECENT RULINGS Homeo Home\u201425 M arch 2009 Ad Monitoring sta Vviewed an ad in Bengali on Channel S for the Homeo Home homeopathic practice. The ad showed a sign for the homeopathic practice; it stated \"Dr Chakresh Chakraborty, HomeopathicConsultant\". in on-screen text as \"Dr Chakresh Chakraborty\", was shown sitting at his desk with a stethoscope. The Bengali voice-over stated \"Renowned homeopathic practitioner from Dhaka, Dr.Chakresh Chakraborty\" has been treating a lot of new and complex diseases for the last three decades ... forasthma, skin disease, sexual diseases, spondilitis, diabetes, hay fever, migraine, infertility, piles, mental stressand various other diseases ... Issue Monitoring sta Vchallenged whether the ad: 1. gave the impression of professional medical advice;2. made medical and therapeutic claims for treatments and referred to specic ailments. Assessment Upheld Channel S stated that homeopathic consultants were often referred to as doctors within the Asian community. We considered the ad implied the man providing the treatment was o Vering professional medical advice because, in the on-screen text and the voice-over, he was referred to as \"Dr Chakresh Chakraborty\"and also as \"Homeopathic Consultant\". Also, the ad showed people being o Vered advice in a setting that looked like a doctor's surgery. We understood that Dr Chakresh Chakraborty was not qualied as a medicaldoctor and so referring to him as such was misleading. We considered that giving the impression ofprofessional advice was unacceptable in advertisements for products or treatments within the remit ofSection 8 of Technology Committee: Evidence Upheld We considered that the ad implied medical treatments were being o Vered. Furthermore, the ad referred to specic ailments, contrary to the Code. The ad breached CAP (Broadcast TV Advertising Standards Code rules 5.1 (Misleading advertising) and 8.1.2 (Impressions of professional advice and support). 8.2.2 (b) (Homeopathic medicinal products). Action We concluded that the ad must not be shown again in its present form. Darulshafa Shirquia \u201415 J uly2009 Ad A TV ad, in Urdu, for a herbal practitioner showed a man limping into a clinic. The ad featured scenes of the clinic sta Vand then showed the same man playing football with a group of boys. The voice-over stated \"Darulshafa herbal clinic has been established in the UK for 41 years. Mr Mazhar Rana is a qualiedherbalist and has been practising for the past 23 years ... All our remedies are prepared using herbs from allover the world and to the nest standards possible. For treatment in good time contact us today\". On-screentext throughout the ad gave the contact details for clinics in Bradford, London and Birmingham, as well asa website address. One of the sta Vmembers stated \"Darulshafa. Renewing traditions, inspiring quality\". Issue One viewer, a medical doctor, challenged whether the implied claim that the advertiser's herbal remedies could treat and cure medical conditions could be substantiated. Assessment Upheld The ASA considered that the scene of the man limping into the clinic, followed by the scene of the same man playing football, implied that he had a medical condition that had been treated at the clinic. Weconsidered that impression was reinforced by the claim \"All our remedies are prepared using herbs from allover the world and to the nest standards possible. For treatment in good time contact us today\", whichwas spoken over the scene of the man playing football, and which we considered suggested that the man hadbeen treated using herbal remedies. Furthermore, we were concerned that some viewers might consider the man had not only been treated but cured of his medical condition. We considered that, unless allowed by a marketing authorisation,illustrations that implied a cure of any medical condition were unacceptable. We were also concerned that,by o Vering a treatment or cure for a medical condition, the ad gave the impression that a medical consultation was not necessary for conditions for which qualied medical advice should be sought. We noted that we had not seen any evidence that showed that the herbal remedies provided by Darulshafa could treat or cure medical conditions or that they held a marketing authorisation, and we thereforeconcluded that the ad was misleading. The ad breached CAP (Broadcast) TV Advertising Standards Code rules 5.1.1 (Misleading advertising), 8.2.6 and 8.2.9 (Medicinal products and treatments). Action The ad must not appear again in its current form. November 2009 Memorandum submitted by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) (HO 45) I am writing to provide written evidence in answer to the following questions: 1. Why don't NICE provide guidance/evaluation on homeopathy?2. Has there ever been an interest in NICE evaluating homeopathy? If so, why was this not approved? The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) is the independent organisation responsible for providing national guidance on the promotion of good health and the prevention andtreatment of Evidence Ev 187 NICE produces guidance in three areas of health: \u2014 public health\u2014guidance on the promotion of good health and the prevention of ill health for those working in the NHS, local authorities and the wider public and voluntary sector; \u2014 health technologies (including technology appraisals)\u2014guidance on the use of new and existing medicines, treatments and procedures within the NHS; and \u2014 clinical practice\u2014guidance on the appropriate treatment and care of people with specic diseases and conditions within the NHS. Topics for guidance development are referred to NICE by the Secretary of State for Health, in line with national priorities established for the NHS\u2014for example; policy importance (ie whether the topic fallswithin a government priority area) and whether there is inappropriate variation in practice across thecountry. Once a topic has been referred, the development of the subsequent advice is entirely theresponsibility of NICE. There are two specic NICE guidance processes relevant here: \u2014 Technology Appraisals\u2014recommendations on the use of new and existing medicines and treatments within the NHS. NICE is asked to look at particular drugs and devices when theavailability of the drug or device varies across the country. This may be because of di Verent local prescribing or funding policies, or because there is confusion or uncertainty over its value. \u2014 Clinical guidelines\u2014recommendations by NICE on the appropriate treatment and care of people with specic diseases and conditions within the NHS. Technology Appraisals NICE does not produce blanket guidance on the use of \"groups\" of therapies, whether complementary and alternative medicines (CAM) or not. To date NICE has not been asked to develop specic guidance onthe use of individual complementary therapies. If the Secretary of State for Health referred this topic to usfor guidance development, we would develop this guidance. We have not been asked to, and have not turneddown a request to evaluate CAM therapies. Clinical Guidelines Where the evidence exists, we have considered CAM therapies, including homeopathy, alongside other conventional treatments in a number of our clinical guidelines. NICE has already made recommendationson where complementary therapies do and don't add benet in relation to specic conditions, includingmultiple sclerosis, antenatal care, palliative care and most recently, low back pain. A summary of theserecommendations is at Appendix 1. Because these guidelines are based on a specic disease or condition, wewould not use this process to look at CAM therapies as a whole. We would evaluate, based on availableevidence, which specic therapies may be of benet. APPENDIX 1 SUMMARY OF NICE CLINICAL GUIDELINES WHERE, BASED ON EVIDENCE, NICE HAS MADE RECOMMENDATIONS ON THE USE OF CAM THERAPIES Antenatal Care \u2014 Few complementary therapies have been established as being safe and e Vective during pregnancy. \u2014 The following interventions appear to be e Vective in reducing morning sickness: \u2014 Ginger; and\u2014 P6 acupressure. Multiple Sclerosis \u2014 There is some evidence to suggest that the following items might be of benet, although there is insuYcient evidence to give more flexible recommendations: \u2014 Reflexology and massage.\u2014 Fish oils.\u2014 Technology Committee: Evidence Dementia \u2014 In the dementia guideline recommendation that for comorbid agitation, interventions tailored to the person's preferences, skills and abilities should be considered. Options to consider include: \u2014 Aromatherapy.\u2014 Multisensory stimulation.\u2014 Therapeutic use of music and/or dancing.\u2014 Animal-assisted therapy.\u2014 Massage. Parkinson 'sDisease \u2014 Recommending that the Alexander Technique may be o Vered to benet people with Parkinson's disease (PD) by helping them to make lifestyle adjustments that a Vect both the physical nature of the condition and the person's attitude to having PD. Supportive and Palliative Care \u2014 When organising supportive and palliative care services for people with cancer, commissioners and the NHS and voluntary sector providers should work in partnership across a Cancer Network todecide how to best meet the needs of patients for complementary therapies where there is evidenceto support their use. As a minimum, high quality information should be made available to patientsabout complementary therapies and services. Provider organisation should ensure that anypractitioner delivering complementary therapies in NHS settings conforms to policies designed toensure best practice agreed by the Cancer Network. Hypertension \u2014 Informing people with hypertension that relaxation therapies can reduce blood pressure and individual patients may wish to pursue these as part of their treatment. However, routine provisionby primary care teams is not currently recommended. Examples include: stress management,meditation, cognitive therapies, muscle relaxation and biofeedback. Depression \u2014 Although there is evidence that St John's Wort may be of benet in mild or moderate depression, healthcare professionals should not prescribe or advise its use by patients because of uncertaintyabout appropriate doses, variation in the nature of preparations and potential serious interactionswith other drugs (including oral contraceptives, anticoagualnts and anticonvulsants). LowBackPain \u2014 Consider o Vering a course of manual therapy, including spinal manipulation, spinal mobilisation andmassage.Treatmentmaybeprovidedbyarangeofhealthprofessionalsincludingchiropractors,osteopaths, manipulative physiotherapists or doctors who have had specialist training. \u2014 Consider o Vering a course of acupuncture needling, up to a maximum of 10 sessions over a period of up to 12 weeks. \u2014 Injections of therapeutic substances into the back for non-specic low back pain are not recommended. Professor Peter Littlejohns Clinical and Public Health Director November 2009 Supplementary memorandum submitted by National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) (HO 45a) [We] haven't approached the Department of Health to ask if we could evaluate homeopathy or expressed an interest in evaluating homeopathy. Tony Beaman Communications Executive (Public A Vairs) National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence Ev 189 Memorandum submitted by David Tredinnick MP, Chairman, Parliamentary Group for Integrated and Complementary Healthcare (HO 46) We spoke briefly at the end of the Science and Technology Committee's Evidence Check on Homeopathy this morning, which I attended in full. I raised a number of concerns with you and am now writing formallyas Chairman of the Parliamentary Group for Integrated and Complementary Healthcare (PGICH),formerly Parliamentary Group for Alternative and Complementary Medicine. I discussed this morning's proceedings at a special meeting of the PGICH following our AGM this afternoon with Lord Colwyn and Alan Simpson. Lord Colwyn sat on the original House of Lords Scienceand Technology Committee that looked at Complementary and Alternative Medicine in 2000. I have the following comments. 1. W itnesses Only one doctor using homeopathy gave oral evidence, and none are scheduled for Monday. No doctors using homeopathy in a primary care setting have been asked. Dr David Reilly from the GlasgowHomeopathic Hospital is regarded as a leading expert on this subject and should have been called. Inaddition, the Society of Homeopaths, which was discussed both directly and indirectly as the principalorganisation representing non-medical homeopaths, should have had the opportunity to put its viewsforward. I believe that the Committee should have ensured that all the experts in this eld were given theopportunity to give oral evidence. 2. E vidence from Sense about Science The Managing Director of Sense about Science, an organisation whose actions over a number of years has caused much harm to homeopathy in the UK, was invited to give evidence. The result of thisorganisation's actions has been the closure of courses, the closure of a very good hospital in Kent andwithdrawal of NHS contracts following a letter sent to all PCT Chairmen on headed notepaper purporting to have come from the Department of Health instructing them not to commission homeopathic services.The Minister Gillian Merron said in her response to my adjournment debate on 14 October onComplementary and Alternative Medicine that \"The hon. Gentleman raised concerns about a documentrecommending disinvestment from homeopathy, which was circulated using the NHS logo. I can conrmthat our inquiries found no record of the Department having authorised the use of the NHS logo and thatthose who originated the document were asked not to circulate it any further. They were advised about theuse of the logo in future and chief executives of trusts were also informed that the document does notrepresent Government policy.\" col 416 Sense about Science is an organisation that does not have anyone on their list of advisors who has any expert knowledge in this eld. 3. S cience 'sParadigms Constantly Change Robert Wilson referred to the fact that other dilute preparations were now being recognised. It is quite likely that science will in the near future adjust its views to take account of this change, in which case theevidence presented by Sense about Science will be dated. It is the role of scientists to push back the frontiersof current knowledge, not to curtail it. 4. Importance of France ,Germany and India It was clear from the evidence put forward that France and Germany are far more advanced in their inclusion of homeopathy within their respective health systems, as usage is signicantly more widespread.In addition, in India, for example, homeopathy can be traced back as early as 1810. The Homeopathichospitals in Calcutta were famous for the treatment of intractable diseases. The success of controllingepidemics like Cholera helped its acceptance in other parts of the country. During the course of itsdevelopment in India, it has gained substantial governmental patronage and has a vast infrastructure. It isone of the medical systems recognized by the Government of India. In 2002 a National Policy on IndianSystems of Medicine and Homoeopathy was formulated and in 2003 there was a Department of Ayurveda,Siddha, Unani, Yoga & Naturopathy and Homoeopathy (AYUSH). On such an important enquiry for the future of homeopathy in the UK the Committee must consider evidence from abroad where that exists. 5. H omeopathy Over the Counter and Prescribed Much of the discussion this morning was about the use and e Vectiveness of over the counter remedies in Boots and other chemists. This ignored the fact that qualied homeopaths when consulted prescribe a muchwider range of homeopathic remedies and in doses well above the 6c and 30c available in chemists. Regularlythey would prescribe in 200c or Technology Committee: Evidence 6. Impact of a Negative Report The Committee should be aware that there are many within the orthodox medical profession and elsewhere in the UK that believe that homeopathy has no place in healthcare provision. These people makeconcerted e Vorts to discredit it and stop it from being commissioned. A negative outcome would give ammunition to those who seek to discredit it, and the Committee therefore has a duty to ensure that thisEvidence Check is thorough and independent. I would suspect that detractors will have no hesitation inforwarding any report produced by this Committee to PCT Commissioners urging them to no longercommission services based on the ndings. Dr Evan Harris already suggested at the session that the reportproduced by NHS Kent West regarding its decision to close the Tunbridge Wells Homeopathic Hospital becirculated by the Department of Health to all other Health Authorities. This is the type of climate thathomeopathy faces in the UK. You will be aware that there is a huge di Verence between there being no evidence of e Ycacy and there not being su Ycient evidence to determine e Ycacy. The Committee needs to look carefully at this. I urge you to take these points into consideration in your deliberations. David Tredinnick MP ChairmanParliamentary Group for Integrated and Complementary Healthcare November 2009 Memorandum submitted by Irish Health Trade Association (HO 47) If I may, I would like to refer you to the website of the South African Faculty of Homeopathy . The faculty provides training in homeopathy for medical doctors. In particular, I would like to refer you to a page of the website titled: Research in Homeopathy http://www.homeopathysouthafrica.co.za/homeopathy research evidence.htm There you will nd the following: 1. A debunking of the myth that homeopathy \"works\" by a placebo e Vect. 2. A highlighting of some randomized clinical trials and the meta-analyses of these trials that show homeopathy has a positive clinical e Vect. 3. A presentation of outcome studies, large case series and research that demonstrates high rates of patient satisfaction with homeopathic treatment. 4. A look at the laboratory research and a meta-analysis of these trials that all show that homeopathy has a multitude of e Vects in laboratory conditions. There follows a demonstration of how research has shown that homeopathy is: \u2014 Safe.\u2014 Cost-e Vective and o Vers an opportunity for resource-conscious health authorities to provide additional health benets for their populations. Homeopathy and funding is then examined in a South African context as follows: \u2014 Increasing numbers of patients and medical doctors are using homeopathy.\u2014 More medical doctors are being trained in homeopathy.\u2014 Funders are prepared to pay for homeopathy. Research that gives encouraging indications as to how homeopathy works is also presented. Dr Alan G Ruth Chief Executive O Ycer Irish Health Trade Association November 2009 Memorandum submitted by Oliver Dowding (HO 48) May I take the opportunity to very briefly explain why homoeopathy should be retained? It's easy to be cynical, and take the line that you don't think that there is anything in it other than water, or if it's on a pill that it's just a sugar pill. May I respectfully suggest that just because it's beyond our abilityto understand the mechanism it doesn't mean that it Evidence Ev 191 I believe that millions of pounds are being invested in the Large Hadron Collider, and much of the nance will have originated from this country. Commendable though it may be to investigate such things, had onetaken the view before the investment began that we didn't know how it worked, or whether it worked, thattherefore we weren't going to undertake the investigation, all that money could have been saved. For 15 years, I treated over 300 dairy cows, and 200 of their o Vspring, almost entirely using homoeopathic remedies. I had two herdsmen who barely had an exam pass between them. They learned very quickly whatto do, when to do it, and which remedy would resolve which problem, using their many years of built-upstockmanship and an occasional education, and some book reading, to understand their animal and matchremedy to ailment. We did not cause animals su Vering, or have welfare problems, and often came out in the top half of research projects undertaking assessment of e Ycacy of treatment of illnesses. Of all the animals we treated, to my knowledge none were pathogenic liars, none were fakes, and in fact, I don't think any of them ever knew what we were treating them with. Had they done so, that would've beena fascinating discovery! How big a scientic study does one need to undertake to prove the e Ycacy of the science? I might add that alongside treating this large number of cows I have also seen many people treated very successfully withthe same remedies. I recently came across a college lecturer in conventional agriculture, who had constantlyteased me about my persistence with homoeopathy, rubbishing it at every opportunity, simply because hecouldn't understand it and deemed it to be illogical. After many years with a persistent hacking cough, oneof his grown-up children persuaded him to go to a homoeopath, and the ailment literally disappeared within 24 hours. He doesn't know how the mechanism works, but he doesn't care, because it made him better. Youdon't know how your computer works, but just as many of us don't know how many other things work, ofwhich we are perfectly happy to deploy every day, our lack of knowledge doesn't stop by utilising theproduct. The same goes for the mechanism by which many drugs operate, in that we don't know exactly how they work in all cases, but it doesn't stop us using them. Unfortunately, we also don't know why in some cases,the use of conventional medication has unexpected side-e Vects, or when multiple doses are used they react in a way that we don't expect. That also doesn't stop us using them. I believe some people consider that the homoeopathic industry has undue influence due to its size. Surely that cannot be the case? If it is, surely we have a right to question the influence of the allopathic drugbusiness? If you care to ask and I'll give you some examples. I thank you for reading this, and although you may be nished with formal settings, I would be happy to make any submission you like, to ensure your knowledge is complete before you adjudicate. Oliver Dowding Shepton Farms Ltd Memorandum submitted by Maria Jevtics (HO 49) Enquiry Received by the Commons Information Office 1. How were the witnesses selected? What qualication did Dr Ben Goldacre, Paul Bennet and Tracey Brown have to give evidence on a highly academic discipline which take more than four years to learn andunderstand? The committee was far better informed than some of the witnesses. 2. There was no witness representing consumers who use homeopathy with satisfaction. There is a large number of people who use homeopathy and are satised and these people are taxpayers and voters. Theyhave a right to be represented in an enquiry such as this. 3. The issue that a homeopath may miss a serious underlying condition is a valid one, however it is the same across the board of all medical disciplines. Homeopaths are trained to ask certain questions to excludeserious underlying conditions. They arev also bound by their code of ethics to recognise these and refer onto a medical doctor if in doubt. There are many misdiagnoses taking place on a daily basis in every GPsurgery and the numbers of people a Vected or killed by misprescribed pharmaceutical is in the hundred thousands per year. 4. If we need scientic evidence for everything we allow, then we must close churches and temples. There is no scientic evidence that God exists and still we allow priests to promise eternal life and salvation. Weallow the church to extract money on a monthly basis from churchgoers all on a scientically unfoundedbasis. This is the boggest hoax in human history. 5. Homeopathy is physically harmless and risk-free. It also gives people mental and emotional peace of mind. There is no reason to undermine it with demands for scientic validity when history teaches us thatoften the science lags behind. Let's not repeat the same mistakes over and Committee: Evidence Quantum physicas also does not make sense to the untrained mind. I do not expect most of the witnesses or committee members to understand something they simply do not know enough about. Just check whetherit is harmful ordangerous. If it is not then what is the problem? November 2009 Memorandum submitted by Mary English (HO 50) I have read and watched the Committee Meeting for Evidence Check: Homeopathy. I would like my (humble) views to be known.1. I am a qualied Homeopath. I had ve years training and hold a Diploma from the School of Homeopathy 2001. I am insured to practice. I work privately in Bath and am supervised by Mabel SmithRSHom. I hold a Certicate in Counselling Concepts from the City of Bath College and am rst aid trained. I have eight years experience of working as a volunteer running a Homeopathic Clinic for drug addicts andalcoholics with The Drugs and Homeless Initiative in Bath. I am past Chair of the charity the HomeopathyAction Trust. 2. My rst experience of homeopathy was buying an over-the-counter \"remedy\" called Aconite that the leaflet in Boots (where I bought it) said was good for croup. I bought the remedy because it said it was safefor children. 3. When my baby son (18 months) had his next attack of croup, I used one tablet of Aconite 6c and his attack of early morning wheezy, panicky breathing subsided in minutes and completely went. 4. This then prompted me to investigate homeopathy and eventually led to me becoming a professional practitioner. 5. If I had not been able to buy the remedy in Boots, I would: (a) have had a child with regular breathing di Yculties, which would have led to drug therapy and side- eVects and dependence on the NHS for treatment; and (b) have never trained or qualied in a therapy that has brought health and healing to a vast number of my patients who would otherwise be a drain on NHS resources. 6. I would urge your committee to take into account, along with all the scientic and medical opinions my small voice of happiness with my discovery of a safe, person centered, individual form of health therapyand my willingness to continue to treat the public in a safe, person-centred manner. Mary English DSH Homeopath I am a qualied Homeopath working in private practice in Bath, UK November 2009 Memorandum submitted by Sue Young (HO 51) I watched with dismay as the bias against homeopathy was given free reign in your Commission on homeopathy the other day\u2014Can someone please enlighten me how the supposed \"placebo e Vect\" is relevant to the following: Plant Darwin's work with drosera? http://avilian.co.uk/2009/03/charles-darwin-proved-homeopathic-dilutions/ Please also seehttp://avilian.co.uk/2008/08/scientic-research-and-homeopathy-meta-analysis/The latest Shang et almeta analysis done in 2005 is very biased, has a very small sample size and does not quote its sources, and turns all the earlier meta analysis, carefully conducted with large sample sizes andwhich do quote their sources, in favour of homeopathy upside down\u2014this is very poor science and quiteobviously malicious. I do trust you can see the vast economic forces fuelling this auto de fe against homeopathy, which is based on lies, more lies, spin and mistruth. Sue Young RSHom November 2009 Memorandum submitted by J A Wheatley (HO 52) I am a lay member who has been studying and practising homeopathic medicine for some 30 years and have been successful in curing cases the medical profession could do no more for. I would be pleased to givechapter and verse to your enquiry. I am sending a copy of this letter to David Tredinnick MP who I knowwell. He is my MP and Chairman of the Alternative Medicines Committee in the House as I am sure youwill know. December 2009 Memorandum submitted by Hugh Evans (HO 54) While looking for another programme on iPlayer, I happened upon the broadcast of your Committee's session of 25 November 2009 on homeopathy, and I hope that I am not too late in submitting someobservations as an ordinary member of the public. First let me declare an interest. For a miserable 18 months, my excellent GP and three expert hospital consultants tried hard, but failed, to cure my worsening balance problem (caused by an inner-ear condition),and a series of prescribed pharmaceutical drugs either had no e Vect or made me feel even worse. In desperation, having been eventually told that I \"would have to live with it\", I turned to a homeopathpractitioner (registered by a national body). I knew nothing about this form of medicine. Over the following ve months, the homeopath worked hard to narrow down the homeopathic prole of my condition, and after monthly consultations, gave me three tablets which I took at two hourly intervalsone Friday afternoon. The problem had gone by the Monday. I have been free from all the balance symptomsever since, and that was 20 years ago. My observations for the Committee are: (a) The Germans and the French are not generally regarded as gullible nations, yet they embrace homeopathy in a very signicant way. Their Health Insurance organisations are very supportiveof homeopathic medicine, because they see good results at a fraction of the cost of the drugssupplied by pharmaceutical companies. I trust that your Committee is taking evidence fromEuropean experts and bodies from outside the UK. (b) Here in the UK, I and many other, including\u2014I dare say\u2014members of the Royal Family, who do not regard ourselves as cranky or gullible, have beneted from homeopathic remedies, sometimesin a highly dramatic way. (c) Homeopathic remedies are very cheap (eg I paid around \u00a34.50 for my bottle of 60 Arnica pills which I use for bruising etc and this will last for years). In countries such as India, where moneyis tight for many people, homeopathy flourishes. I hope that the Committee will take evidence frompoor countries such Technology Committee: Evidence (d) In the discussion I saw from your Committee session, I did not hear much from the point of view of the patient. I hope, therefore, that your report will include evidence from patients, be they peoplewho have beneted from homeopathy, been harmed by it, or found it a waste of time. I hope that these observations will be of some interest to you. Memorandum submitted by the British Medical Association (BMA) (HO 55) Homoepathic Remedies I note that the Science and Technology Committee's evidence check on homeopathic remedies is drawing to a conclusion and I thought that the Committee might be interested in the British Medical Association's (BMA) view on this issue. I wanted to inform the Committee that we have long been concerned about theuse of complementary and alternative medicines (CAM) and over the last 20 years the BMA's Board ofScience has worked extensively to develop BMA policy on CAM. Our policy development has focussed on the discrete therapies which have established training programmes, criteria of competence, professional standards and the potential for use alongside orthodoxmedical care. Doctors have a duty to safeguard public health and BMA policy has therefore focused on theprinciples of good practice in CAM which would safeguard the individual against possible harm to healthand maximise the potential benets of particular CAM methods. As you may be aware, the popularity of CAM has led to greater demand for CAM on the NHS. This has coincided with changes in healthcare provision which aim to facilitate greater patient choice. Research intothe e Ycacy of CAM however has raised questions about the use of NHS resources for such provision. As such our members would be supportive of a call in the Committee's nal report to request that NICE reviewand report on the cost e Vectiveness of homoeopathic remedies and for NICE to recommend whether they should continue to be funded by the NHS. I hope that you nd this useful. Professor Sir Ken Calman ChairBoard of Science Memorandum submitted by Dr Vijay Vaishnav (HO 56) We write this as academicians and homoeopathic practitioners. We have been in the eld of homoeopathic education and practice for 25 years in Mumbai (Bombay), India. It is disheartening to learn about the chaos and furore over homoeopathy in the UK. Questions have been raised in the British Parliament whether homoeopathy is scientic and whether it should be supported andfunded by the government. Government Patronage In India, homoeopathy has progressed considerably because of the patronage received by it from the Indian government. It was recognized as a system of medicine by an Act of Parliament, and with theformation of the Central Council of Homoeopathy (CCH), homoeopathic education and practice wasregulated. Regulations The CCH has regulations in place that prescribe the minimum standards of education and training in homoeopathic colleges in India. No person is allowed to practice homoeopathy unless he/she has graduatedfrom a homoeopathic college that is recognized by the CCH. Correspondence courses are not recognized. Training of Homoeopaths The training of a homoeopathic student in India is similar to that of a student being trained in conventional (allopathic) medicine. This means that a student has to enroll in a college for a full-time courseof 4 \u00b0years (plus a one year compulsory internship) in homeopathy. He is taught the same subjects as his contemporary in the allopathic course\u2014anatomy, physiology, pathology, medicine, surgery, OB-GYN andcommunity medicine. He also has to attend practicals (eg dissections in anatomy, biochemistry inphysiology, etc.) as well as clinics in clinical subjects with demonstrations on real patients, and observing aswell as assisting in surgeries as well as deliveries in Evidence Ev 195 Use the Indian Model This is lacking in most of the countries in the world where homoeopathy is being practiced. The onus is on the British government to regulate the training and practice of homoeopathy in UK. The MPs shouldstudy the rules and regulations of the CCH, India, and make use of the experience of this organization tohelp streamline the practice of homoeopathy in UK and also prove to the world (and themselves!) that ithas a scientic basis. Research in Homoeopathy The Central Council for Research in Homoeopathy (CCRH), India encourages research and development of homoeopathy in India. It has piloted many research projects to prove the e Ycacy of homoeopathy. Many new drugs have been proved by the CCRH and lots of scientic papers have been published by it includingclinical research done on HIV/AIDS, Bronchial Asthma, Cancers, etc. The CCH and the CCRH under the Department of AYUSH (Ayurved, Unani, Siddha, Homoeopathy) of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India. The Department ofAYUSH encourages the Central Councils of the various alternative systems of medicines to organize CMEsfor practitioners and ROTPs (Re-Orientation Training Programmes) for teachers. It also sanctions fundsfor research at recognised institutions. Evidence Based Homoeopathy We have had success in treating cases with organic lesions and we have published them in various homoeopathic journals. We have also published many of these cases on our web site www.drvaishnav.com.Theses cases with documented evidence in the form of X rays, Ultrasounds, Colour Doppler studies, etc,both before and after treatment, prove that homoeopathy really works. We have published an article in ajournal for allopathic doctors on the role of ultrsounds in homoeopathic practice. The article underscoresthe awareness of a modern homoeopath and the scientic approach to the treatment of his patients. Dr Vijay Vaishnav MD (Hom) Professor and ex-Head, Dept of Materia Medica, CMP Homoeopathic Medical College, India Dr Daxa Vaishnav MD (Hom) Professor Head, Dept. of OB-GYN, CMP Homoeopathic Medical College, India Memorandum from Government on \"Evidence Check\" This memorandum was collated by the Government O Yce for Science in response to the former House of Commons Innovation, Universities, Science and Skills Committee's \"Evidence Checks\". The response to the rst Evidence Check was received on 28 September 2009. The response to the second Evidence Check was received on 13 November 2009. Homeopathy [See Ev 60] Dyslexia [See Science and Technology Committee, Second Report of Session 2009-10, Evidence Check 1: Literacy Interventions, HC 44, Ev 101] Swine FluVaccinations This response was provided by the Department of Health. Q1 What is the Government's policy regarding the production of a swine flu vaccine and its distribution to the population? Government policy is to purchase vaccine licensed for use in Europe in accordance with the European Directive on Procurement. The vaccine has been produced in Europe. The Secretary of State for Health announced the priority groups for the swine flu vaccine on 13 August. More than 11 million people in England will be targeted rst. The vaccine will initially be prioritised to thosegroups of people who are at highest risk of severe illness, as well as frontline health and social care workers. Based on the current delivery forecasts from both manufacturers, we expect to have approximately 55 million doses available by the end of the year\u2014enough for up to about 30 million people to be vaccinated\u2014with more following after that. The vaccine will be delivered in phases as stocks become available. Thevaccine may be licensed by early October and this could result in the vaccination programme being rolledout from Q2 What expert scientic and medical advice have been used to steer the Government's policy? The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) reviewed the evidence and advised the Department of Health on these priority groups. This advice was also scrutinised and endorsed by theScientic Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE). We will continue to take the best independent scientic advice to inform our decisions on the response to swine flu. The following groups will be prioritised for the swine flu vaccine in this order (numbers given are approximate and are for England only): 1. People aged over six months and under 65 years in current seasonal flu vaccine clinical at-risk groups (about 5 million people). 2. All pregnant women, subject to licensing conditions on trimesters (about 0.5 million people).3. Household contacts of people with compromised immune systems eg people in regular close contact with patients on treatment for cancer (about 0.5 million people). 4. People aged 65 and over in the current seasonal flu vaccine clinical at-risk groups (about 3.5 million people). This does not include otherwise healthy over 65s, since they appear to have some naturalimmunity to the virus. Vaccination of frontline health and social care workers (approximately 2 million people) will begin at the same time as the rst at-risk group, and will continue for as long as necessary. This group is at increased riskof infection and of transmitting that infection to susceptible patients. Protecting these people will help theNHS workforce to remain resilient and able to treat sick patients. Literacy and Numeracy Interventions [See Science and Technology Committee, Second Report of Session 2009-10, Evidence Check 1: Literacy Interventions, HC 44, Ev 34] Teaching Pseudoscience at Universities This response was provided by the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills. Q1 What is the Government's interpretation of the term \"pseudoscience\"? The Government does not nd it helpful to dene pseudoscience. It is committed to policy-making based on scientic evidence. By science we mean all-encompassing knowledge based on scholarship and researchwhich is underpinned by methodologies that build up and test increased understanding about the worldand beyond. Q2 What is the Government's position on universities that award BSc and MSc in subjects that are pseudoscientic? When recruiting sta V, does the Government recognise such qualications as providing the holder with scientic expertise? All universities undertake research and teaching, but HEIs are autonomous institutions and decide the courses or content of the higher education they o Ver to their students who make informed choices about the curriculum they choose to study. In relation to degrees in specic disciplines, there may be further processesaround accreditation and recognition by professional bodies, which may allow some judgements to be madeabout, for example; the quality of course content, teaching, skills acquired, but this is not for Governmentto prescribe. The standards of degrees awarded by HEIs, and the quality of learning opportunities, are subject to independent review by the Quality Assurance Agency (QAA) and external examiners. Since the QAA wasestablished in 1997 its reviews have consistently indicated that quality and standards are being maintained. Departments have delegated responsibility for recruitment and should have robust processes in place for ensuring that appointments are made on merit. When appointing, departments will look at the skills,experience and qualications required for the role. For some roles, a particular scientic expertise orqualication might be sought from any range of appropriate disciplines. Health Checks for Over40s This response was provided by the Department of Health. Q1 What is the Government's policy on the provision of free health checks for over 40s? From 2009-10, the NHS is being asked to implement a uniform and universal vascular risk assessment and management programme called the NHS Health Check programme, for everyone in England between40 and 74. The proposals for this programme were set out in Putting Prevention First published on Ev 197 Vascular diseases, that is heart disease, stroke, diabetes and kidney disease, are the biggest cause of death in the UK, and the NHS Health Check programme could on average prevent 1,600 heart attacks and strokesand save at least 650 lives each year. The programme could prevent over 4,000 people a year from developingdiabetes and detect at least 20,000 cases of diabetes or kidney disease earlier, allowing individuals to be bettermanaged and improve their quality of life. Vascular disease also makes up approximately a third of the di Verence in life expectancy between spearhead areas and the rest of England. This programme will help ensure greater focus on the preventionof coronary heart disease, stroke, diabetes and kidney disease, and will help people remain well for longer.Type II diabetes mellitus is a growing public health concern. Its prevalence is increasing and diabetescontributes signicantly to overall health inequalities within England. This programme o Vers a real opportunity to make signicant inroads in tackling health inequalities, including socio-economic, ethnic andgender inequalities. The purpose of an NHS Health Check is to identify an individual's risk of coronary heart disease, stroke, diabetes and kidney disease, for this risk to be communicated in a way that the individual understands, andfor that risk to be managed by appropriate follow-up, including being recalled every ve years forreassessment. The check itself involves a standard assessment based on straightforward questions and measurements. These would record basic information such as height, weight, current medication, age, family history,smoking and blood pressure and include a simple blood test for cholesterol and (in some cases) glucoselevels. This will be followed up with personalised advice on how to lower that risk and maintain a healthylifestyle. For those at low risk, this might be no more than general advice on how to stay healthy. Othersat moderate risk may be recommended a weight management programme, stop smoking service, or a briefintervention to increase levels of physical activity. Those at high risk might require medication with statinsor blood pressure treatment, or an intensive lifestyle management programme for those identied withimpaired glucose regulation. A few may need further assessment or tests. We also expect to identify people who already have a vascular disease where it has so far gone undetected, particularly type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease. In such cases patients will benet from an immediatestart on a disease management programme to manage their condition and prevent adverse complications. Q2 What evidence (specically cost-benet analyses) led to the formulation of this policy? What evidence has been used to support health benet claims (eg lives saved per year)? The NHS Health Check programme is both cost e Vective and clinically e Vective. The approach taken in the programme is based on economic modelling undertaken by the Department of Health (DH) which has used guidance produced by the National Institute of Health and Clinical Evidence(which reviews the clinical and cost e Vectiveness of interventions in medicine). The full details of the analysis undertaken by the Department are set out in the Impact Assessment which can be viewed on the DH website (http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publicationsandstatistics/Publications/PublicationsLegislation/DH 090351). It shows the cost of the programme to be \u00a3332 million each year and the average annual benet to be \u00a33,678 million. Based on these gures, the NHS Health Check programmeis highly cost e Vective. (The costs are the costs of the checks and net lifetime costs of interventions given to the cohort of individuals checked in the rst 20 years. The benets are calculated on the basis that eachquality adjusted life year a patient enjoys has an estimated social value of \u00a350,000). Quality-adjusted life years are a measure of how many extra years of life of a reasonable quality a person might gain as a result of treatment. The modelling also showed that the programme would cost around \u00a33,500 per quality-adjusted life year gained. This is considerably below the \u00a320-30,000 per quality-adjusted life year threshold that NICE usesto assess cost e Vectiveness and therefore, according to this test, the programme is highly cost e Vective. Measuring the Benefits of Publicly -funded Research This response was provided by the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills. Q1 What generic social and economic benets are derived from funding research with public money? Publicly funded excellent research produces new knowledge and understanding, which is a benet in its own right, but also generates signicant economic impact. The Warry Report, 41drew on the HM Treasury Green Book, to dene economic impact as follows: \"An action or activity has an economic impact when it a Vects the welfare of consumers, the prots of rms and/or the revenue of government. Economic impacts range from those that are readilyquantiable, in terms of greater wealth, cheaper prices and more revenue, to those less easilyquantiable, such as e Vects on the environment, public health and quality of life.\" 41Increasing the economic impact of Technology Committee: Evidence Economic impact is delivered by publicly funded research via many routes, including: \u2014 Creating new businesses.\u2014 Improving the performance of existing businesses.\u2014 Delivering highly skilled people to the labour market.\u2014 Attracting R&D investment from global business.\u2014 Improving public policy and public services. Q2 What evidence is there for social and economic benets? How is this evidence used to determine funding priorities? There is extensive evidence of the benets of publicly funded research. A report that looks at the economic impact of the research base as a whole is produced annually by BIS (formerly by DIUS), and is structuredaround an Economic Impact Reporting Framework, which portrays the generation of economic impacts atthe aggregate economy level. 42It is wide ranging, and includes sections on the ve routes to economic impact bulleted above, as well as others. In 2006 the then DTI published Making the most of UK Research,a collection of case studies of benets from research. 43 Each Research Council prepared initial Economic Impact baselines as part of their Delivery Plans published in December 2007, and updated versions were published this year.44 The impact of other funding streams has been independently evaluated. The Higher Education Innovation Fund (HEIF) is one such stream,45and its impact on knowledge transfer is borne out by the annual Higher Education-Business and Community Interaction (HE-BCI) survey,46which shows universities external income rising to record levels of over \u00a32.8 billion per year. The Science ResearchInfrastructure Fund (SRIF) has been shown to have dramatically improved research infrastructure, and tohave wider benets in terms of researcher productivity and ability to attract other funding. 47The knowledge transfer performance of Public Sector Research Establishments is also improving, bringing in record levelsof external income. 48 The research community itself also regularly carries out evaluation of the economic impact of research. To pick just a few recent examples, the Russell Group have evaluated the impact of research in theiruniversities, 49the Wellcome Trust has assessed the economic benets of medical research,50and Oxford Economics have assessed the economic e Vects of fundamental physics research.51 Before allocating the Science and Research Budget, DIUS collected evidence on the activities and performance of all funding lines. All the Research Councils and the Academies provided detailed deliveryplans, which set out what future investment would deliver against the overarching objectives. Other keyprogrammes, such as HEIF and SRIF, were subject to independent evaluation. The following factors were taken into account in determining the Science Budget Allocations to individual Research Councils and Academies: \u2014 a thorough assessment of draft Research Council and Academy Delivery Plans for CSR07; - the strength of the case for increasing the investment in any particular area of research in CSR07; and \u2014 a full evaluation of the performance of each of the Research Councils and Academies through the SR04 period. The allocation of the Quality-related Research block grant to Higher Education Institutions by HEFCE has in the past been informed by the results of the Research Assessment Exercise (RAE). HEFCE arecurrently developing the Research Excellence Framework (REF) to replace the RAE. The REF will for therst time explicitly take account of the impact research makes on the economy and society. 42Economic Impacts of Investment in Research & Innovation, DIUS (2008). 43Available at http://www.dius.gov.uk/ x/media/publications/F/le35789 44Available at the Vectiveness of HEFCE/OSI Third Stream Funding, PACEC (2009). 46Higher education-business and community interaction (HE-BCI) survey (2009). 47Science Research Investment Fund: a review of Round 2 and wider benets, Technopolis Group (2009). 48Fourth Annual Survey of Knowledge Transfer Activities in Public Sector Research Establishments, Technopolis (2008). 49The Impact of Research produced by Russell Group Universities, Russell Group (2009). 50Medical Research: What's it worth?, Health Economics Research Group at Brunel University, the O Yce of Health Economics and RAND Europe (2008). 51The economic impact of fundamental physics research on the UK economy, Oxford Economics 199 TheFuture of GM T echnologies This response was provided by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural A Vairs. Q1 What is the Government's policy on the development and commercialisation of genetically modied crops? The Government conrmed its current Policy on GM crops in a Parliamentary statement in March 2004. Safety is the Governments top priority and as such we follow the science and assess potential GM crops ona case-by-case basis. This is consistent with the existing EU legislation which requires genetically modiedorganisms to be cleared for trial or commercial release, with decisions based on an assessment of the risk tohuman health and the environment. The Government acknowledges that GM crops could o Ver potential benets over the longer term. We should keep an open mind, but continue to be led by the science. Q2 What evidence and expert advice has been used to determine government policy regarding genetically modied crops? The Government receives expert advice on individual applications to release GM crops from the Advisory Committee on Releases to the Environment. It conducts an independent scientic evaluation and adviseson the potential risks for human health and the environment. The Government's broad policy on GM outlined above was informed by the ndings of the \"GM Dialogue\" process that it sponsored in 2003. This had three strands: a public debate run by an independentboard; a GM science review led by the then Government Chief Scientist; and a study of the overall costs andbenets of GM crops, undertaken by the Prime Minister's Strategy Unit. Further details can be found onDefra's website http://www.defra.gov.uk/ENVIRONMENT/gm/crops/debate/ Synthetic Biology This response was provided by the Health and Safety executive. Q1 What is the Government's policy on the regulation of synthetic biology? The Government recognises that this is a new and exciting eld of technology, which has the potential to deliver benets in areas such as medicine, manufacturing, and the environment. However, there is also a needto identify, anticipate and address any societal issues that might arise from synthetic biology, whilst enablingUK research and industry to harness the technology to develop and deliver benets for society. Synthetic biology involves a range of techniques culminating in the insertion of synthetic heritable material into living cells. In many ways this is an extension of existing recombinant DNA technologies.Consequently the Government considers that most applications are likely to fall under existing legislationcovering the development and use of genetically modied organisms. Future work may involve the creation of articial cells, which would not fall within the scope of existing legislation. Consequently, a minor amendment is being proposed to the denition of GM as part of thedevelopment of a single regulatory framework for work with human and animal pathogens and GMOs. Thiswill enable the regulations to cover articial cells, should the technology develop in that direction. Thischange will be consulted on prior to the implementation of the new regulatory system. The Government also recognises that the regulatory system needs to be kept under review to ensure that it is able to deal with the likely development and applications of synthetic biology, including those relatingto biosafety, biosecurity and the release of genetically modied organisms into the environment. In doingso, it recognises that lessons should be drawn from the past to help ensure regulations keep pace with, oranticipate, scientic developments. Q2 What evidence and expert advice will the Government seek to underpin future regulation? Are current regulations adequate or will a new regulatory framework be required? The Government regularly checks the appropriateness of the existing UK GM legislation (GMO deliberate release and GMO contained use regulations) to deal with new technologies, including syntheticbiology. Scientic advice on the topic has been sought from scientic advisory committees (AdvisoryCommittee for Releases into the Environment (ACRE), and Scientic Advisory Committee for GeneticModication (SACGM (CU)), the UK research councils, and other government departments and agencies. The Government will continue to consult a wide range of stakeholders to ensure that the regulatory system is appropriate, and that the best advice is available to evaluate developments in synthetic biology. It is widely anticipated that most applications of synthetic biology will start in the laboratory in compliance with the GMO contained use regulations, before a proportion will progress to deliberate release.Activities falling under the GMO contained use regulations contained will require risk assessment andproportionate Technology Committee: Evidence Deliberate release applications can only be approved once su Ycient supporting knowledge and data is available. Defra and HSE are also involved in a working group under the auspices of the EuropeanCommission, which is considering the new technologies in light of existing GM denitions and legislation.The working group will report to the EC in October. UK legislation covering the contained use of genetically modied organisms is under review, with the intention of creating new legislation amalgamating the GM legislation with the contained use of human andanimal pathogens. This provides an opportunity to ensure that aspects of synthetic biology that might beoutside the scope of current legislation are encompassed in the emerging single regulatory framework. Theproposed amendment extends the denition of genetic modication to include the \"introduction of geneticmaterial into a cell articially created for that purpose, where the cell is then capable of replication or oftransferring genetic material\". It is felt that this amendment will be su Ycient to ensure that synthetic biology is fully covered by UK legislation. A full consultation exercise will be carried out before the denition isincorporated into the regulations. Use of Offender Data This response was provided by the Ministry of Justice. Q1 What is the Government's policy on the use of o Vender data (eg, employment, access to nance)? Whether o Vender data relating to convictions can be used for most purposes is dependent on whether a conviction is spent or unspent under the Rehabilitation of O Venders Act 1974. The Act serves to help rehabilitate those who have stayed on the right side of the law for a period of time, thereby assisting reformedex-o Venders nd jobs, obtain insurance and avoid discrimination. Until a conviction is spent it may have to be declared for any purpose\u2014for instance when obtaining nancial products, seeking employment, or applying for any sort of licence, for instance a licence to sellalcohol or engage in a certain type of business. This is fair as an unspent conviction may indicate a relevantrisk, and is a fair consequence of a criminal penalty. However once a conviction is spent under the Act it is treated\u2014for most purposes\u2014as if it doesn't exist. This reflects the fact that the ex-o Vender has remained on the right side of the law for a specied period and proven they pose less of a risk in most circumstances. As the rehabilitation periods di Ver according to the sentence imposed the period for which a conviction needs to be disclosed is related to the severity of the individual o Vence. However there are certain positions\u2014particularly those involving access to children and vulnerable adults, and working in positions of exceptional trust or for the State\u2014where the employer needs to be ableto take the most stringent of assessments in order to minimise a genuine risk. For instance those workingin the police, looking after children or vulnerable adults, or working with access to highly controlled substances, can potentially cause a much greater level of harm if they do o Vend. For this reason there are certain purposes where an exception to the Rehabilitation of O Venders Act exists. These are all specied by the Rehabilitation of O Venders Act 1974 (Exceptions) Order 1975 (as subsequently amended on numerous occasions). Amendments to the order are by means of a Statutory Instrument subject to a Yrmative procedure. The government's policy is that those areas listed on this order are deemed su Yciently sensitive that the employer should always be able to see a person's full record, including all spent convictions and cautions,in order to come to a fair judgment on their suitability (and any appropriate safeguards) based on the fullavailable evidence. But it is equally important to note that having a criminal conviction is not an automatic bar to employment in any of these areas. The government believes that it is important for employers to take abalanced view on the fact that an individual has a criminal conviction, whether spent or unspent, taking intoaccount factors such as how long it is since the o Vence, the person's age at the time of the o Vence, the relevance of the o Vence, and what else is known about the individual's character and conduct before and since. In order to obtain a Criminal Records Bureau disclosure containing details of spent convictions, it is necessary for the employer to make a declaration that it is for purposes specied in the ROA ExceptionsOrder. An employer obtaining details of spent convictions by means of a fraudulent statement would becommitting an o Vence. It is the government's belief that this system\u2014within the framework of the Rehabilitation of O Venders Act 1974 and the Police Act 1997, and ne-tuned by updates to both primary and secondary legislation\u2014helps create a balance between the need to disclose o Vender data when there is a need to do so for purposes of protecting the public, and the need to enable reformed ex-o Venders to put their past behind them at Ev 201 Q2 What evidence is there to support the various ways in which o Vender data are used? Statistical evidence is hard to obtain when one is dealing with subjective decisions. The system can be said to have worked either when an o Vender gets a job and does not re-o Vend, or when an o Vender is prevented from entering a job where they intended to cause harm. The latter is impossible to prove. There is no proof that an ex-o Vender would re-o Vend if placed in a sensitive position, even if their criminal conviction was recent, serious and relevant. In some cases anindividual who is barred from a sensitive position may\u2014had he or she been employed in that position\u2014have gone on to commit a serious o Vence or abuse of trust; in other cases they could have gone on to have a faultless record. It is impossible to produce denitive gures on an event which has not been given theopportunity to happen. However when employers make judgments they have to do so on the basis of a fairrisk analysis using their knowledge of the job, the opportunities it a Vords, and the record of the person applying. CRB statistics, compiled by MORI, indicated that in 2008, around 18,000 unsuitable people were prevented from working with children and/or vulnerable adults as a direct result of a CRB check, bringingthe total to around 98,000 people in the past ve years. This, even when assessed with the caveats above,would still indicate that the purpose of the system to bar unsuitable candidates is working. As there is no control study it is hard to use these statistics as proof of the e Vectiveness of the current system. However they do provide evidence which supports the way in which o Vender data is currently used. These statistics indicate that there are those on both sides of the system\u2014employers of sensitive positionsand ex-o Venders\u2014who have beneted from the system. As long as the decision to share information is balanced in terms of being necessary, eg to protect the public, and proportionate, eg to the risk the o Vender poses, it can benet all parties. As to whether a better balance could be established, improving one or both of these sets of gures\u2014this is certainly something to which the government aspires. The 2002 Home O Yce report \"Breaking the Circle\" recommended reforms to the ROA and the government has made a commitment to work on implementingthe proposals. And the Vetting and Barring Scheme, established under the Safeguarding Vulnerable GroupsAct 2006, will enable a better, fairer and more joined-up approach to vetting those working with childrenand vulnerable adults. But the fundamentals of the scheme\u2014that once convictions are spent they are onlymade available to those who have a need to know\u2014are working and will not be changed. The next phaseof the scheme commences in October 2009 with a phased implementation of registration under the schemebeing introduced between July 2010 and 2015. Sharing of Information between Police and Probation Information-sharing between criminal justice agencies is necessary for e Vective sentencing and the protection of the public. Information about o Venders is currently shared between the police, prison and probation services to enable sta Vto manage o Venders e Vectively, as provided for within the O Vender Management Act 2007 (s14). Probation may request information from the police service for a range ofreasons to enable the public to be protected, including for the following purposes: for bail informationinterviews and reports; at the pre-sentence stage, for making appropriate sentence recommendations; tomake appropriate placement decisions for unpaid work (community payback) requirements; assessment forlicence conditions prior to the release of a prisoner; for informing reports to the Parole Board for consideringan o Vender's parole. However, this must be within the parameters of relevant legislation and guidance, which are designed to balance the rights of the individual, ie the subject of the information being shared, with the rights of societyto be protected from that individual. Therefore, information shared about a person must be both necessary(eg to meet the probation purposes of managing risk of harm) and proportionate (eg to the risk posed bythat person). These principles should govern the decision by the police service to share information in therst place and the decision by the probation service over whether to use the information to inform theirreport. The National O Vender Management Service is in the process of agreeing an information-sharing protocol with the Association of Chief Police O Ycers to formalise the processes for exchanging information between the police and probation services for the e Vective management of o Venders. The agreement will set out the purpose and principles of information-sharing, along with the legal basis for o Vender management activity, and the legislation governing the disclosure of personal data. It will provide for and encourage the sharingof information in certain circumstances, but make the legal implications to earlier and more widespreadinformation-sharing clear. Certain o Venders are managed under the Multi Agency Public Protection Arrangements. MAPPA is a process where the Responsible Authority (police, prison and probation services together with a number ofDuty to Co-operate Services which include Jobcentre Plus and Housing) work together to manage theidentied risks presented by these o Venders. MAPPA applies to: \u2014 sexual o Venders who are required to notify the police of their details under the Sexual O Vences Evidence \u2014 violent o Venders as dened by Schedule 15 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 who are sentenced to 12 months custody or more; and \u2014 those dangerous o Venders who have a previous conviction or caution for a violent o Vence who the Responsible Authority (police, prison and probation services) consider present a risk of seriousharm to others. MAPPA relates to o Venders in the community and each MAPPA o Vender will be assessed to identify the level of multi agency management they require and in every case whether a disclosure regarding the risksthe o Vender presents should be made to another person/organisation to protect others from harm. There is occasions where disclosure will be made to an employer to ensure that the o Vender is not placed in a situation which would be unsuitable for the risks they pose; for example, a sexual o Vender working unsupervised with children or vulnerable adults. All decisions regarding disclosure are recorded on the case managementsystem. Where an o Vender is actively multi agency managed through MAPPA at level 2 or 3 (this means that a number of agencies are actively working together to share information, identify risks and establish a multiagency risk management plan which can require the commitment of additional resources), the disclosuredecision will be formally recorded at the MAPP meeting. Where disclosure is to take place, the details of theinformation to be disclosed, who to and who by will be recorded in the MAPP meeting minutes and recordedon ViSOR. ViSOR is a database which has been developed to be used by police prison and probation toassist in the management of violent and sexual o Venders. It is a condential system which is used by the police as their primary case management system with sexual o Venders. The prison and probation services use it to share information which enhances risk assessments. R&D S pend and PSRE s This memorandum was prepared by the Government O Yce for Science.

Ev 209 Brain Gym This response was provided by the Department for Children, Schools and Families. Q1 What is the Government's policy on the use of Brain Gym and the teaching of its underlying theory in schools? The Department is aware of \"Brain Gym\", which is presented as learning readiness activities to help children of all physical, social and learning abilities to develop and practice sensory-motor skills for relatedlearning skills. The Department does not have a specic policy on the use of Brian Gym. We are unaware of any suYciently robust or peer-reviewed evaluation of the approaches it promotes, which would allow any clear link between the use of Brain Gym and pupils' learning to be established. We are also aware of a signicantbody of criticism of the theoretical underpinnings of the programme, set out below. Overall, Brain Gym has not been evaluated using a robust and appropriate methodology, therefore no conclusions about its e Vectiveness can be drawn using the existing sources of information. Q2 What scientic evidence is there that Brain Gym works? Does the Government support the scientic theory behind Brain Gym? Brain Gym has been criticised as being unscientic in a wide-ranging and authoritative review of research into neuroscience and education. Peer reviewed scientic studies into Brain Gym have found no signicant improvement in general academic skills. Brain Gym's claimed results have been put down to the placebo e Vect and the general benets of breaks and exercise. Brain Gym's founder, Paul Dennison, has admitted that many of BrainGym's claims are not based on good science, but on his \"hunches\". 52 In 2008 Sense About Science published a brieng document in which thirteen British scientists responded to statements taken from the \"Brain Gym guide (Teacher's Edition)\". Each of them entirely rejected thestatements that were put to them. Brain Gym's scientic content was described as \"pseudo-scientic\". Oneof the scientists, Professor of neuroscience Colin Blakemore, said that \"there have been a few peer reviewedscientic studies into the methods of Brain Gym, but none of them found a signicant improvement ingeneral academic skills. Sense about Science, along with the British Neuroscience Association and thePhysiological Society, wrote to every Local Education Authority in Britain to warn them about theprogram. 53 In 2007 Dr Keith Hyat of Western Washington University54wrote a paper in which he analysed the available research into Brain Gym, as well as its theoretical basis. He concluded that Brain Gym is notsupported by research, and that its theoretical basis does not stand up. The paper also encouraged teachersto learn how to read and understand research, to avoid teaching material that has no rational basis. Background notes Brain Gym is a commercial training program created in the 1970's by Dr Paul Dennison and Gail E Dennison, who \"were seeking more e Vective ways to help children and adults of all physical, social and learning abilities, in particular those identied through the programme as \"learning disabled.\" 55 The program is based on the premise that all learning begins with movement, and that any learning challenges can be overcome by nding the right movements, to subsequently create new pathways in thebrain. It claims that the repetition of certain movements \"activates the brain for optimal storage andretrieval of information\" and \"promotes e Ycient communication among the many nerve cells and functional centres located throughout the brain and sensory motor system. There are 26 of these exercises, which aredesigned to \"integrate body and mind\" in order to improve \"concentration, memory, reading, writing,organising, listening, physical coordination, and more. Educational Kinesiology teaches that brain function is dened in terms of three dimensions: laterality is the ability to co-ordinate the left and right sides of the brain, focus is the ability to co-ordinate the front andback of the brain, and centering is the ability to co-ordinate the top and bottom of the brain.

Teaching English as an Additional Language This response was provided by the Department for Children, Schools and Families. Q1 (a) How does the Government identify school children who do not speak English as a rst language and/ or who need additional training in English? Identication From 2007 the School Census included a new Pupil First Language question. This allows schools to record each pupil's rst language, rather than simply recording whether or not that language is English. Pupils who do not speak English as a rst language are identied through this census and a pupil's rst language is dened as any language other than English that a child was exposed to during early developmentand continues to be exposed to in the home or community. If a child was exposed to more than one language (which may include English) during early development, a language other than English should be recorded, irrespective of the child's prociency in English. Process Pupil First Language data is collected from either parents or pupils as part of the school's admissions process and is usually obtained after parents have received conrmation of their child's place at the school.This information is also collected for new pupils arriving during the academic year. Local Authority Data, Statistics, IT and Ethnic Minority Achievement (EMA) teams within Local Authorities are involved in the data collection process. They work closely in planning and implementing thedata collection. School administrative sta Vwill input the information once this has been collected, but the collection process needs to be led by the school's Senior Management Team (SMT) and supported by specialist EMAstaV, who should assist administrative sta Vin making decisions about how to record replies which cannot be mapped easily to the language code set. DCSF statisticians use the School Census as a source for the Language variable which aggregates the pupils' language into the following seven main groups: \u2014 English.\u2014 Not known but believed to be English.\u2014 Other than English.\u2014 Not known but believed to be other than English.\u2014 Refused.\u2014 Information not obtained. \u2014 Invalid code. Q1 (b) How are children whose rst language is not English taught English? National Strategies, a DCSF delivery partner have developed guidance with detailed strategies to help teachers support EAL pupils in the acquisition of English. They have focused on creating an inclusivelearning culture by developing an inclusive curriculum to support learning and teaching. Pupils with EALare generally taught in the mainstream class using sca Volding learning strategies and other methods that involve keeping cognitive challenges high. The following National Strategies publications provide guidanceand advice on teaching pupils with EAL. Excellence and Enjoyment: Learning and teaching for bilingual children in the primary years. http:// nationalstrategies.standards.dcsf.gov.uk/node/85322 Rationale for planning for children learning English as an additional language Ev 211 Q2 What evidence is used to support the method of identifying and teaching those children who require additional language support? Method of identication The Race Relations (Amendment) Act 2000 places a duty on schools to 'monitor and assess how their policies a Vect ethnic minority pupils, sta Vand parents'. Monitoring by ethnicity and language allows schools and Local Authorities (LAs) to compare the performance of di Verent ethnic groups and assess the needs of those who seem to be underachieving. The collection of rst language data can make a major contribution to the planning and implementation of strategies which promote equality, value diversity and support the educational inclusion of all pupils.Good quality language data is also of particular importance where provision for pupils who speak more thanone language is involved. Language data also supports the analysis of pupil attainment at school, local and national level, and assists LAs and schools in their use of ethnic background data, providing valuable complementaryinformation and a means of validating ethnicity data. Children learning EAL are among the highest and the lowest achieving groups nationally and because of this it is important that schools look at the achievement of children from di Verent ethnic groups who are learning EAL. Proper analysis and understanding of data will make it possible to gain a better insight into the many and complex issues that may contribute to variations in attainment by di Verent groups of learners. EAL Pedagogy/Method of teaching Research shows that language support is best provided within the curriculum wherever possible, as time out of subject lessons for additional language tuition is ultimately likely to cause the learner to fall furtherbehind in the curriculum. Research over the past two decades into the development of young bilingual learners has resulted in the development of a number of theories and principles that underpin the distinctive pedagogy for children whoare learning EAL\u2014children for whom the additional language being learned is also the medium ofeducation. The development of EAL pedagogy has been influenced by social constructivist theories whichemphasise the importance of sca Volding learning, and those which highlight the importance of socio- cultural and emotional factors. Children learning EAL will be a Vected by attitudes towards them, their culture, language, religion and ethnicity. There has been a great deal of research over the past two decades into the development of young bilinguals\u2014international, national and local including classroom-based action research. This has resultedin the development of important theories, principles and knowledge that have underpinned the developmentof these materials. The practical ideas, supporting materials and approaches included have been developedand trialled with the support of Local Authorities (LAs) and a large number of schools as part of the PrimaryNational Strategy during 2004-06. Evidence Research undertaken has looked at: \u2014 How well children from ethnic minority backgrounds are actually doing in our schools.\u2014 The characteristics of e Vective schools. \u2014 The language and literacy skills and academic achievement of bilingual learners. The following extract from an OfSTED publication HMI 250 2001 Inspecting English as an additional language 5-16 states on page 17 that \"Inspection evidence demonstrates that the most e Vective work is closely linked to the National Curriculum and that withdrawal from the mainstream should be limited withoutcomes carefully monitored. In particular, de-contextualised language activities are rarely productive.\" The QCA (now known as QCDA) booklet\u2014 A language in Common: Assessing English as an additional language is a guide for Teachers and headteachers of pupils and students with English as an additional language, LEA support services, and English teachers. It has been developed to support the assessment ofpupils of all ages for whom English is an additional language. The guide is intended to help teachers ensurethat all their pupils develop as competent and condent speakers and writers of English. The studies of academics, including those below, have been taken into account when developing the English education system of approach to supporting pupils with EAL.

Street lighting and crime Q1 What is the Government's policy on the use of street lighting to reduce crime? There is a well established body of evidence to show that the design and layout of places has a signicant impact reducing crime and fear of crime. Home O Yce guidance recommends that designing out crime and designing in community safety should be central to the planning and good design of the built environmentand that as part of good design the role lighting can play in reducing crime should be considered. Further, Home O Yce guidance also reflects that in any crime reduction programme, street lighting should be considered in co-ordination with other intervention strategies not least because of the role it plays inincreasing community pride and informal social control. The companion guide to Planning Policy Statement 1 \"Safer Places, The Planning System and Crime Prevention\" (ODPM/Home O Yce 2004) for example highlights that well-designed public lighting increases the opportunity for surveillance at night and sends out positive messages about the management of an areabut that it needs to be sensitive to the needs of residents and users and should provide security withoutresulting in glare and compromising privacy. Q2 On what evidence is the Government basing this policy? A systematic review of existing international evidence on the e Vectiveness of improved street lighting on crime was published in 2008 (review for the Campbell Collaboration, by David Farrington & BrandonWelsh). The review concluded that improved street lighting signicantly reduces crime, adding thatimproved street lighting should be considered as a potential strategy in any crime reduction program incoordination with other intervention strategies, and that depending on the analysis of the crime problem,improved street lighting could often be implemented as a feasible, inexpensive, and e Vective method of reducing crime. An earlier (2002) review for the Home O Yce by the same authors had come to the same conclusions. References Farrington, D and Welsh, B (2008): E Vects of improved street lighting on crime.

The origins of CCTV provision for public space in this country lie in the early 1980s. Since then (and mostly by local authorities) the use of public space community safety CCTV has expanded gradually butsignicantly and it now plays a key role in crime and anti-social behaviour reduction, public protection,missing person inquiries and serious crime, including terrorism investigations. CCTV has been installed fordiVerent reasons in Evidence Ev 213 CCTV does work and works best when it is used alongside a wider strategy of partnership working between the police, local authorities and local communities to tackle crime in their neighbourhood. Seeking to make sure that the benets of CCTV are applied e Vectively to prevent crime and to deal with those who choose to commit crime, the Government's focus is on better training, improved partnershipworking and more co-ordinated use of technology. Recognising the need to strengthen the evidence base and provide strong and compelling narrative on the how well CCTV is working: \u2014 The National Policing Improvement Agency and Cheshire Constabulary by the end of the year (2009) aim to have completed a qualitative analysis of recorded crime data and case les in Cheshireto determine the value of CCTV to investigations. \u2014 By next Spring, establish a library of case studies around the use of CCTV in crime detection with particular focus on major crime, including CT and public-space violence; and, in the same timeframe. \u2014 Develop the criteria for assessing the quantitative and qualitative costs and benets of CCTV. This will enable Government, the police, local authorities and the private sector to assess existing andfuture investment in CCTV and the contribution that it makes and can make to crime detection,crime reduction and public condence. Q2 On what evidence is the Government basing this policy? The most recent and most robust assessment of the international evidence on the impact of CCTV was a 2008 systematic review by academics Brandon Welsh and David Farrington, published by the CampbellCrime and Justice Group. The review was part funded by the Home O Yce. The review found that CCTV has a modest but statistically signicant crime reduction e Vect; is most e Vective in reducing crime in car parks; is most e Vective when targeted at vehicle crimes (largely a function of the successful car park schemes); and is more e Vective in reducing crime in the UK than in other countries. The review concluded that while the results lend support for the continued use of CCTV to prevent crime in public space, they suggest that it bemore narrowly targeted than its present use would indicate. Other research has shown that CCTV can increase public condence and there are some high prole case study examples of how CCTV has played an important role in detecting crime and protecting the public: forexample, in recent terrorist investigations (including 7/7 and 21/7), and the conviction of Steve Wright forthe Ipswich murders.

Q1 What is the Government's initial analysis of the Human Provenance Pilot Project and plans for this scheme in the future? This joint UKBA/SOCA pilot project is aimed at tackling abuse of the asylum system, particularly nationality swapping. The pilot planned to run over three months involves a combination of forensictechniques such as isotopic analysis of hair and nails together and ancestral DNA and will be combined withlanguage analysis and enhanced interviewing to examine whether this can indicate a persons possible originsand recent movements. All testing will be voluntary with the person required to give written consent. Duringthe pilot the data will not be used to support live decision making but rather to examine the viability of thetechniques. At the conclusion of this pilot we will review the results, including the underpinning science andthe ethical implications of the work. The Forensic Regulator will also be consulted during the period of the3 month pilot. Only if the evaluation and regulatory review is positive, will UKBA proceed to use the resultsof future tests to support the decision making process Technology Committee: Evidence Another part of this project is aimed at combating child tra Ycking and child abuse by DNA testing family groups where there is a reasonable suspicion they are not biologically related as claimed. This is in line withnew statutory duties to protect vulnerable children. These tests are not subject to the three month reviewand the results will be used by case owners and the social services. The project planned to run to July 2010 depending on ongoing evaluation and future funding. Q2 What evidence was used to formulate this programme? The pilot was based on some preliminary scientic papers in these areas (see attached bibliography) which suggested that a small proof of concept trial was an appropriate next step.

RoadSafety :Bicycle Helmets This response was provided by the Department for Transport. Q1 What is the Government's policy on recommending or requiring the use of bicycle helmets? The Department for Transport believes it is sensible for cyclists, and especially children, to protect themselves by wearing a cycle helmet. Our road safety publicity materials and the Highway Coderecommend the use of a cycle helmet. We have no plans to make their use compulsory. Q2 What evidence on bicycle helmets and safety has the Government considered in formulating its policy? A review commissioned by the Department (\"Bicycle Helmets\u2014A review of their e Vectiveness\", Road Safety Research Report No 30, available at:- http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/roadsafety/research/rsrr/theme1/bicyclehelmetsreviewofe Vect4726) concluded that overall there is evidence that bicycle helmets can be eVective at reducing the incidence and severity of head, brain and upper facial injuries and that they can Ev 215 eVective in reducing injury for users of all ages, though particularly for children. The report also concludes that there is some evidence that compulsory helmet wearing may discourage some people from cycling,leading to decreased bicycle use. However, we believe it would be irresponsible not to promote a product that can reduce injuries and we continue to promote helmet wearing on a voluntary basis, especially by children. The Department has commissioned a new research project on cyclists' road safety. This will include a new review of cycle helmet e Vectiveness. We are aiming to complete the review of cycle helmet e Vectiveness later this year with the publication of the project's nal reports in Autumn 2010. We measure cycle helmet wearing rates periodically, in 1994, 1996, 1999, 2002, 2004, 2006 and most recently 2008. The 2008 wearing rate survey shows that cycle helmet rates on major built up roads have goneup from 30.7% in 2006 to 34.3% and on minor roads have gone up from 13.8% in 2006 to 16.7% in 2008.The wearing rate for children on major built up roads was 17.6% in both 2006 and 2008, while for childrenon minor roads the rate rose from 9.4% in 2006 to 12.0% in 2008. Whilst compulsion remains an option that we will review from time to time, at these levels making helmets compulsory would cause enforcement di Yculties and without greater public acceptance could have an e Vect on levels of cycling. Speed Cameras This response was provided by the Department for Transport. Q1 What is the Government's policy on use of speed cameras? The primary objective for speed camera deployment is to reduce deaths and injuries on roads by reducing the level and severity of speeding. The aim is to do this by preventing, detecting and enforcing speed o Vences, which includes encouraging changed driver behaviour by the use of safety camera activity. Safety cameras are deployed and operated locally by road safety partnerships as part of their overall road safety remit. They have the freedom to spend the specic road safety grant on cameras or any other locallyagreed road safety measure. The Department for Transport's guidance on the use of cameras recommendsthey are deployed only where there is a history of speed related accidents or where there is communityconcern about speeding. Cameras should be coloured yellow and co-located with speed limit signs wherepermitted and practicable with warning signs placed in advance, so that motorists are easily able to complywith the speed limit. However, the police may also carry out covert speed enforcement. Q2 What evidence is there that the policy improves road safety? Evaluations around the world have shown repeatedly that speed cameras reduce vehicle speeds, accidents, deaths and serious injuries at camera sites. A literature review undertaken by the University of the West ofEngland, published 11 February 2005, failed to nd a single published research paper anywhere in the worldthat found cameras to have negative overall e Vects. The independent four-year evaluation report of the National Safety Camera Programme was published on 15 December 2005. It found a 42% reduction in people killed or seriously injured at camera sites acrossthe 38 partnership areas, that means around 1,745 fewer people killed or seriously injured per annum,including over 100 fewer deaths. In addition, there was a 22% reduction in personal injury collisions, whichtranslates into a reduction of 4,230. These evaluations are of the benets of the cameras over and above thelong-term national trend of casualty reductions. However, a proportion of the reduction could beattributable to \"regression-to-mean\" (this arises because accidents in the period before the installation of acamera may be higher than the long-term average for that location). The report concludes that, even afterallowing for this, safety cameras achieve substantial reductions in collisions and casualties. Evidence suggests that in addition to motorists slowing down in the immediate vicinity of camera sites, they have also been slowing down in the wider area where speed cameras are located. The Department'sannual Vehicle Speeds data shows that the proportion of cars exceeding the speed limit on 30mph roads hasreduced from almost three quarters in 1996 to just under half in recent years. WindTurbine Syndrome This response was provided from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural A Vairs with input from the Department of Energy and Climate Change. Q1 Does the Government have a stance on Wind Turbine Syndrome? Wind Turbine Syndrome is a name coined by one researcher in the United States who believes that those living close to wind farms can su Ver from a variety of symptoms as a result of their proximity to wind farms. It is unclear whether there is widespread support from other professionals for these e Vects to be formally described as a syndrome. The cause of these e Vects seems to be the noise (and perceived vibration) that can be generated by wind turbine units. The Government has no formal stance on WTS, but will review itsposition as and when new Committee: Evidence Q2 What evidence does the Government consider when assessing the potential health risks of wind turbines to nearby residents? With regard to noise, the Government has been aware for many years of the potential noise impact from wind turbines. In the mid 90s, it prepared a report through the Energy Technology Support Unit (ETSU)of the former DTi that described how noise from wind farms should be assessed and what noise criteriashould be applied. The current Planning Policy Statement (PPS) 22 on renewable energies also makesreference to this document as does the recently published consultation documents setting out the proposednew National Policy Statements for renewable sources. The ETSU report sets out the method by which thegovernment expects developers and planning authorities to take account of the noise impacts and byimplication the noise related health e Vects of wind farms. The Government has also commissioned research to understand further the impacts of noise from wind farms and how they should be assessed. The evidencearising from that research is being reviewed. The Government is aware of the possibility of other health a Vects linked to wind turbines, in particular the risk of photo epilepsy arising from \"shadow flicker\". PPS22 states how to assess and address shadowflicker advising that if the wind turbines are located in accordance with guidance in PPS22 then the risk ofshadow flicker should be avoided. 13 November 2009 Printed in the United Kingdom by The Stationery O Yce "}
