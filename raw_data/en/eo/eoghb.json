Chemical engineers have always been proud of their flexibility. A solid and very general technical background enables them to work effectively in and adapt quickly too many different fields. The chemical engineer is an expert at dealing with the chemical and physical changes of matter and with the conversion of energy. Most chemical engineers use this knowledge in jobs that involve the application of chemical research to the production of chemical materials and products. This entails product development and market research; economic feasibility studies; research; development and design of chemical processes; design of process equipment; supervision of the construction, start -up, operation, and maintenance of chemical plants; and process improvement for pollution control and energy conservation. Chemical engineers are found working in such diverse areas as business, applied physics, manufacturing, applied mathematics, biochemistry, medicine, patent law, food processing, pollution monitoring and prediction, sales, and industrial management. All of these are in addition to the already wide range of types of jobs traditionally thought of as chemical engineer ing jobs. Chemical engineers are employed in a wide variety of industries: petroleum and gas, chemicals, minerals and metals; glass and ceramics; plastics and resins; soap and detergents; manufacturing; missile synthetic fibers and textiles; paint, paper, and cellulose; pharmaceuticals; and process equipment manufacture. They also are involved in private consulting, government and higher education.

Release of Student Information The department routinely receives requests from employers and graduate schools to provide names of potential candidates to aid them in their recruitment. We will provide such lists, with directory information, unless you request that we not include you in such releases. We do not release individual GPA information unless the student has authorized the organization to request it. You may request exclusion by submitting a written request to DeAnn Pitman in 2162 Sweeney Hall, or set your information release preferences in AccessPlus. Advising The primary point of contact for most advising questions will be your academic adviser. The academic advising staff will help you with the class registration process, degree audit corrections, answering questio ns about ISU, College of Engineering, and departmental policies and procedures, handling class scheduling difficulties, and guiding you to campus resources. You also will visit your academic adviser each semester for guidance regarding class registration and to receive your current Registration Access Number (RAN). See the ISU Academic calendar for registration advising dates. Shortly after enrolling in CH E 202, you will also be assigned to a faculty mentor. At this time, you will also receive a Plan of Study (POS) form (page 14), which you should attempt to complete before meeting with your faculty mentor. Visit with your faculty mentor to discuss progress and goals, select electives that support your program of study, generate career goals, learn more about the profession of chemical engineering, gain assistance in applying to graduate school, and for any other issue that requires faculty expertise. You are expected to plan your Program of Study (POS) and choose courses to meet the elective requirements for a more intentional college experience. Degree Audits (DA) show your progress toward completing degree requirements and are available in AccessPlus at any time to you or your academic adviser. If you are on Academic Warning or Probation based upon the grades you earned in the fall or spring semester, you must complete an Academic Intervention Self-Assessment as soon as possible (available on AccessPlus). Once this is complete, you must meet with your academic adviser to discuss the obstacles that have impacted your academic success no later than the 10th class day of the subsequent semester. Your faculty mentor is the primary source for: The ChE Academic Advising Staff can help with: Developing an elective package How to add or drop a course, or register Information about the profession Consulting on course adds/drops Career and profession questions Information about degree requirements Working on a degree program Resolving course scheduling problems Discussing undergraduate independent study project s Signing co-op and internship forms Obtaining a recommendation letter Providing copies of forms you need or department publications Learning about graduate school Guidance to campus and community resources 3 Academic Integrity It is imperative that society be able to rely upon the integrity of the members of our profession. At the university, faculty members expect you to follow high ethical standards in your academic work. Rules and procedures regarding actions that constitute academic dishonesty are included in the Iowa State University Information Handbook. These apply to all students. In addition, the chemical engineering faculty have adopted the following policy statement, which applies in chemical engineering courses. Faculty members expect that work submitted in your name be entirely your own work. You should not copy assignments, exams, quizzes, computer programs, etc. from others or allow copying of your work. It is usually permissible to discuss homework assignments with other students, unless your instructor specifies to the contrary. For examinations and quizzes, a stricter standard is imposed. For exams and quizzes the presumption, unless otherwise stated, is no discussion, no use of notes, no use of books or journals, and no use of work of others. If in a particular instance the instructor wishes to modify any part of the department policy, you will be so informed in writing. American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE) Code of Ethics Members of the American Institute of Chemical Engin eers shall uphold and advance the integrity, honor, and dignity of the engineering profession by: being honest and impartial and serving with fidelity their employers, their clients, and the public; striving to increase the competence and prestige of the engineering profession; and using their knowledge and skill for the enhancement of human welfare. To achieve these goals, members shall: Hold paramount the safety, health and welfare of the public and protect the environment in performance of their profess ional duties Formally advise their employers or clients (and consider further disclosure, if warranted) if they perceive that a consequence of their duties will adversely affect the present or future health or safety of their colleagues or the public Accep t responsibility for their actions, seek and heed critical review of their work and offer objective criticism of the work of others Issue statements or present information only in an objective and truthful manner. Act in professional matters for each emplo yer or client as faithful agents or trustees, avoiding conflicts of interest and never breaching confidentiality Treat fairly and respectfully all colleagues and co-workers, recognizing their unique contributions and capabilities Perform professional services only in areas of their competence Build their professional reputations on the merits of their services Continue their professional development throughout their careers, and provide opportunities for the professional development of those under their supervision Never tolerate harassment Conduct themselves in a fair, honorable, and respectful manner 4 Tornado/Severe Weather Guidelines If your area is threatened by a tornado, your primary thought should be how to save lives, not possessions. Time is of the essence. You may only have time to duck under a sturdy table or get into an interior hallway. DO NOT activate the fire alarm! Seek safe places for shelter, such as steel-reinforced office buildings, storm shelters, tunnels, sub- basements, underground parking facilities, basements, and interior corridors. Keep away from windows, structures with large free-span roofs such as auditoriums and gymnasiums, the upper stories of multi- story buildings, house trailers and parked cars. An automobile, whether p arked or moving, is the most dangerous place to be. Violent winds can tumble a car over and over, crushing it and its occupants. Seek shelter immediately. Do not attempt to drive out of the storm path, because this has proven fatal to many motorists. If you are trapped in open country, seeking shelter in a ravine or ditch may be your only hope. However, be aware of the torrential rains that often accompany tornadic weather. If you are in an office building, dormitory, or any other multi -story structure, go to interior hallways on a lower floor, preferably in the basement. In homes, a basement usually offers the greatest safety. If no basement is available, take cover under heavy furniture in the center of the house against strong inside walls. Covering yourself with a rug or blanket provides some protection against flying glass and falling debris. If you are in a mobile home park, or any non-reinforced structure without a basement, seek shelter elsewhere, such as a public building, friend's basement, c ommunity shelter, etc. At shopping centers, stay away from large glass windows. If possible, take cover under a strong counter. No matter where you are, do some advance planning. Identify protective areas you can get to in a hurry. Take responsibility for receiving your own severe weather notifications \u2014 sign up for an e-mail or text alert from your local TV station's website. Severe Weather Definitions Tornado Watch Conditions are favorable for tornadoes (or severe thunderstorms) to occur. Stay informed. Tornado Warning A tornado or severe thunderstorm is occurring or is imminent. Seek shelter immediately. Severe Thunderstorm A storm that produces wind damage, dime -size hail or larger and winds up to 58 mph. Tornado A violently rotating column of air in contact with the ground and coming from a thunderstorm. Funnel cloud Similar to a tornado, but not in contact with the ground. NOTE: At Iowa State, all the permanent brick and stone buildings on central campus are of reinforced construction and offer good shelter. Remember to stay away from outside windows and doors and go to interior hallways and basements if possible. If you live in university housing, be sure to review the information and instructions that the Department of Residence -Housin g has provided on tornado safety routines. Find this information online at http://www.housing.iastate.edu/life/safety/weather. 5 Part 2: Curriculum and Requirements 6 Outcomes of the Program The chemical engineering program should produce graduates that have: An ability to apply knowledge of mathematics, science and engineering An ability to design and conduct experiments as well as to analyze and interpret data An ability to design a chemical engineering system, component or process to meet desired needs An ability to function on multi -disciplinary teams An ability to identify, formulate, and solve chemical engineering problems An understanding of professional and ethical responsibility The ability to communicate effectively The broad education necessary to understand the impact of chemical engineering solutions in a global and societal context Recognition of the need for and an ability to engage in lifelong learning A knowledge of contemporary issues The ability to use the techniques, skills and modern engineering tools necessary for engineering practice Demonstrated thorough grounding in chemistry and a working knowledge of advanced chemistry such as organic, inorganic, physical, analytic al, materials chemistry, or biochemistry A working knowledge, including safety and environmental aspects, of material and energy balances applied to chemical processes; thermodynamics of physical and chemical equilibria; heat, mass and momentum transfer; chemical reaction engineering; continuous and stage- wise separation operations; process dynamics and control; process design; and appropriate modern experimental and computing techniques An ability to function as engineers in an international setting An ability to function as professional engineers in the industries related to chemical engineering An ability to pursue research and advanced studies in chemical engineering or in related fields such as medicine, law, and business Course descriptions may be found in the current ISU Catalog, which is available online at http://catalog.iastate.edu/azcourses/. Basic Program Requirements Engineering students are required to complete certain basic courses as a condition of enrollment in engineering courses at the 200-level or above. The general requirement is to complete the engineering Basic Program with a grade point average of 2.00 or better (transfer credits are included in this average). The basic program courses are: MATH 165, MATH 166 CHEM 177 (or CHEM 167) ENGL 150, ENGL 250 PHYS 221 ENGR 101, CH E 160 LIB 160 Students are to complete the basic program prior to enrolling in 200-level engineering courses; however, ENGL 150 and ENGL 250 may be taken conc urrently. These and other exceptions are listed under the College of Engineering Curricula in the ISU Catalog (http://catalog.iastate.edu/collegeofengineering). For transfer students, enrollment is permitted for no more than two semesters prior to satisfying the basic program requirements. For transfer students, certain waivers and substitutions are possible and should be discussed with your academic advisor as early as possible. It is allowable to: 1. Substitute transfer credit for ChE 160 only if the coursework contains both engineering problem -solving and computer programming experience. 2. Substitute CHEM 167 for CHEM 177. 3. English Placement info: http://www.agstudent.iastate.edu/orientation/english%20placement%20info.htm. 7 Core Course Requirement The College of Engineering requires that each student must have a minimum GPA of 2.00 in a group of 200-level and above courses to meet graduation requirements. The chemical engineering faculty have designated the following chemical engineering courses as core courses for this requirement: CH E 202, CH E 210, CH E 310, CH E 325, CH E 356, CH E 357, CH E 358, CH E 381, 382, CH 420, CH E 421, CH E 426, and CH E 430. The Degree Audit available in AccessPlus will show this grade point average each semester under Chemical Engineering Core. Transfer credits will be included in this average. The cumulative GPA is based upon all courses, excluding transfer courses. This means the grade point average will be based upon those courses that were actually taken at Iowa State University. Design Experience The design experience begins in the second year in CH E 210, Materials and Energy Balances, in which students are introduced to the design and computation tools that will be used in subsequent courses. Introduction to databases, data manipulation and reduction, and the use of numerical method packages are covered, along with the concept of optimization and economic design. The design experience then continues through the sequence of primarily engineering science courses \u2014 fluid mechanics, heat transfer, mass transfer, thermodynamics, reaction engineering and proces s control. At least one organized design experience is in each of these courses. Meanwhile, a significant emphasis on the design process is in each of the chemical engineering laboratory courses. Students will design at least one new experiment in each of these courses. The senior elective courses include a design experience. Finally, the capstone design course, CH E 430, brings together all of these elements in an integrated design experience. The overall plan is to distribute the process of learning to design chemical engineering processes, products and systems throughout the curriculum in a continuous experience. Social Science and Humanities (SSH) Electives Both Iowa State University and industry want our graduates to be well-rounded professionals who can interact with their coworkers, business clients, and society. Social Science and Humanities (SSH) electives are an important part of your chemical engineering degree program. These courses can help you develop or expand skills necessary to achieve success within both industry and society. A similar Iowa State University and CBE department goal is to prepare you to meet the challenges of responsible citizenship and effective professional roles in a culturally diverse global community. To help achieve this goal, all undergraduate students must fulfill graduation requirements in two areas: U.S. Diversity (USDiv) and International Perspectives (IP). The focus of the U.S. Diversity requirement is the multicultural society of the United States. Courses used to meet the requirement provide students with insights that enhance their understanding of diversity among people in the U.S. The focus of the International Perspectives requirement is the global community. Its objective is to promote your understanding of cultural diversity and interdependence on a global scale. Many of the courses on the following SSH list fulfill both SSH and either USDiv or IP requirements. If the chosen US Diversity or International Perspective course is not on the SSH list, additional SSH credits must be taken to meet the minimum 15 SSH credits. SSH requirements include: Minimum of 15 credits from the list of approved courses below At least 6, but no more than 9, credits must be in the same department 8 The following list of approved SSH's have notations if they also meet the US Diversity or the International Perspectives requirement. Refer to the online list for a more complete listing of US Diversity and International Perspectives (http://www.registrar.iastate.edu/courses/div -ip- guide.html) . Note that some departments offer courses where most are acceptable for SSH requirements . For these departments, the list of courses in this handbook include only those courses that also meet US Diversity or International Perspectives requirements, but other courses from this department may apply to the SSH requirements. The International Perspectives requirement may be alternatively met with an academic experience involving a stay in a foreign country of three weeks or greater duration. A course involving travel abroad for less than three weeks is also approved for use in meeting the requirement if it carries three or more academic credi ts. International students are exempt from completing a course to fulfill the International Perspectives requirement; however, the requirement of completing a minimum of 15 credits from the SSH list still must be met. Applying Independent Study (490) courses for the Social Science and Humanities Electives will require prior approval by your advisor and Curriculum Committee. Consult with your advisor for courses not on this list, such as Honors Seminars, experimental courses, or other courses that you think might qualify. The following list of SSH courses is extensive. To help you determine which courses to take a helpful strategy is to start with topics (departments) that are of interest to you. Use the course catalog to look up the descriptions of the first few courses in these departments, since those are most likely to have no or few prerequisites. For example, if you are interested in psychology, look at the descriptions for PSYCH 101, 230, and 280 to decide which course to include in your course schedule. After taking one or two of these courses, you may want to review upper -level course descriptions for any additional courses of interest to you. You may use the Schedule of Classes website under the Students tab on ISU's homepage (http://classes.iastate.edu/ ) to help you to decide on a course any particular term. For example, if you wanted to fulfill the USDiv requirement during the Fall 2014 semester, first select the Fall 2014 term at the top.

On the flowchart that follows, cross off courses that you already have completed and circle the courses in which you are currently enrolled. Complete the Plan of Study (POS) form on the next page by following the steps below: 1. Completely fill out the heading. 2. List credits that can be used to meet degree requirements that were earned before entering ISU (transfer, AP, test out, etc.) in the first semester block. Label this semester as \"TR\" for transfer. 3. List any transfer course that needed to be evaluated in the \"Approved Course Substitutions\" with the ISU course number that it was evaluated as being \"equivalent to\" or as a \"substitute for.\" 4. The next Semester block would be your first term at ISU. Label it appropriately (e.g., \"F14\" for Fall 2014; \"S15\" for Spring 2015; or either \"SS15\" or \"1'15\" for Summer 2015). List all courses taken that term. Do this for each term through the current term. 5. Continue listing courses that you plan to take for future terms, checking off each course on your flowchart as you list it on the POS form. This will help you to account for each requirement without listing the requirement mo re than once. 6. List each elective course on the right column under the requirement that it will meet. Do this as you list the course in the term that you will take the course. 7. Keep in mind/make sure: A. Courses are available during the term that you have scheduled them B. Credit loads for each semester are within acceptable limits (18 credits per semester, or 21 for Honors Program) C. All course prerequisites are satisfied D. All curriculum requirements for graduation are satisfied. 8. Discuss your POS with your faculty mentor. Changes made to the Technical Elective choices are to be approved by your faculty mentor. 13 CHEMIC AL ENGINEERING CURRICULUM PLAN of Study (2014-15 Catalog) Name ID# Entry Term GRAD TERM Date Honors Bio-Option Double Degree w/ Double Major w/ Minor in Start with applicable transfer courses, fill in the co urses prior to ISU, have taken, current ly taking, and plan to take.

The elective requirements are in social sciences/humanities and in technical areas including communication. You are strongly encouraged to take the LTM E308 learning community that integrates the writing component of ENGL 314 with the lab reports in CH E 325. This provides you with the advantage of extra help with your written reports and joint assignments that are submitted to both classes. The chemical engineering curriculum includes 21 credits of technical electives, which provide students the opportunity to develop a deeper understanding of additional areas of science and engineering. You are encouraged to carefully plan your elective choices. Elective planning MUST be done in consultation with your faculty mentor and the choices must be clearly identified on your curriculum Plan of Study (POS) (see p. 14). Technical electives can be selected to develop a breadth of knowledge or to establish an \"area of emphasis.\" For example, you may wish to take a broad range of courses to prepare for graduate school. Alternatively, you may wish to focus your studies to develop a stronger background in an area of emphasis , such as biochemical engineering or solid state materials processing. Suggestions for several additional areas of emphasis are listed on pages 22 -24. Your faculty adviser also can assist you in preparing an emphasis not currently listed on those pages. Be sure to plan early enough to permit taking necessary prerequisites. No more than six credits total of CH E 490 or other STEM departmental independent/research study may be counted toward technical electives. Important Note: Some of the classes that ar e listed in the Iowa State University Catalog as prerequisites for the technical electives listed on the following page may apply only to people in that specific area of study. Prerequisites may be waived by the course instructor if the course is being taken by someone outside of that department's curriculum. Always consult with your adviser and course instructor about waiving any prerequisites for your technical electives. The various elective requirements are listed in Tables I and II. Table I - Electiv es MINIMUM CREDITS Social Science & Humanities electives: (see pages 8-12) 15 Technical Electives 21 411, 3 Statistics electives: STAT 305, 231, 341, 342, 401, 495, 496, MAT E 316 3 Chemical Engineering electives: These include CH E 406, 408, 415, 440, 447**, and any other 300+ CH E course not specified as required in the curriculum 6 Engineering electives: Any 300+ engineering course outside of chemical engineering that does not repeat material in required ChE courses nor on SSH list. Approved exceptions: AER E 261, BioE 220, CPR E 281, EE 201, EM 274, and MAT E 273 Consult mentor for approval. 3 Professional electives: 300+ Physical Science, Life Science, Engineering, Statistics, Mathematics, or Computer Science not on SSH list Approv ed exceptions: MATH 207, MICRO 201, 201L, and those approved for Engineering & Advanced Chem electives. 3 * Courses not allowed as Technical Elective due to content overlap with required CH E courses: AE 316/BSE 316, 402, 411; AER E 446, EM 378, MAT E 311, ME 332, 335, 411, 421, 436, 475; ** Only one of Ch E 447 or Mat E 351 may count toward graduation. 21 Biological Engineering Option You may enhance your academic preparation for the growing opportunities in the biological -related industries by adding the biological engineering option to the standard chemical engineering program.

These programs have been recognized as being some of the leading internationalization efforts for American chemical engineering departments. Through these programs you have the opportunity to: Study for 1-2 semesters at prominent chemical engineering departments in Europe, Asia, or Australia Participate in a 5-6 week summer school course in Oviedo, Spain Gain international work experience with a global corporation in conjunction with an academic exchange A summary of the programs available to chemical engineers is provided below. You are urged to contact the program coordinators for more information. Several of the programs have application due dates that you should carefully note. International Summer Study Program The CBE department has a summer study program in Oviedo, Spain, available to juniors, seniors, and qualified sophomores involving a chemical engineering laboratory course. University of Oviedo Summer Laboratory Program This 5-week program offers the opportunity to complete a lecture and laboratory course at the University of Oviedo and to compare the technical and cultural aspects of the U.S. and Spain. Ample opportunities to travel in Europe are available for those deciding to do so. Students from University of Wisconsin -Madison also participate in the Oviedo program. Iowa State students who participate in this program earn seven semester credits in CH E 391 and CH E 392, which apply toward the B.S. requirements (four credits substitute for CH E 325 and CH E 426 and three credits may apply to the SSH requirement). The credits are given on the basis of participating in the following: An orientation course (CH E 391) during spring semester at Iowa State; Lectures attended and laboratory experiments performed during a five-week program at the Universit y of Oviedo; Visits to Spanish chemical engineering departments, research laboratories, and manufacturing facilities, mostly during the third week of the program. The cost of the program (excluding personal entertainment and transportation costs) is about $6,000 for Oviedo. Loans and foreign study grants are available to qualified applicants. Applications for these programs are due in the fall, usually by mid-November. For further information, contact Dr. Charles Glatz, cglatz@iastate.edu Internationa l University Exchanges The CBE department administers several highly successful university exchanges with international universities. The mutual exchange agreements involve several of the leading chemical engineering departments in Europe, Australia and Asia. Students generally attend for one to two semesters, perhaps with a travel period coordinated with the university schedules. Coursework is sufficiently similar at these universities so that students are able to continue their degree program at Iowa State without interruption. The exchanges allow students to develop a better cultural and social understanding of the host country and to participate more fully in a new academic experience. Most students have formed lasting contacts with classmates and faculty. 27 The programs are organized according to Iowa State procedures established through the Iowa State University Study Abroad Center. This includes: Applying for the program at specific dates (see each program below) Registering and paying tuition and fees as if remaining at ISU, but selecting course work at the international university Paying no fees at the international university, but providing your own transportation and living costs Receiving credit for the courses towards your degree Specific arrang ements for each program differ slightly; contact the program coordinator for each exchange.

Honors program students may participate by registering for CH E 490H. 30 Faculty and Their Research Interests (http://www.cbe.iastate.edu/research/) Students should contact faculty members directly if they are interested in working for them. Mufit Akinc - Processing of advanced materials, solid-liquid and solid-gas interface, synthesis of nono powders, fibers. Design and development of materials for ultra- high temperature applications, infrar ed transmitting oxides, insulation materials. Kaitlin Bratlie - We are interested in understanding biomolecule interactions with polymers through optical techniques to engineer materials for drug delivery and tissue engineering applications. The relationship between structure and the foreign body response is of great interest. We employ whole animal fluorescence imaging, nonlinear optical imaging, and a variety of biochemical assays to study these phenomena. Robert Brown - The use of biorenewable resources (crops and biomass) as a source of chemicals and energy is the focus of our research activities. Combustion and gasification in fluidized bed for electric power production is one aspect of our work. In collaboration with fermentation experts, we are also evaluating a hybrid thermal/biological process to convert lingo- cellulose into alcohols and acids. Rebecca Cademartiri - We are studying the interactions of biological moieties (e.g., bacteriophages, proteins, cells) with materials to generate rules which govern conjugation. Understanding the underlying rules will help us to quickly adapt our biology/materials conjugates to new challenges (e.g., different chemical environments during pathogen detection in water). As an example, simple charge based interactions will allow us to easily exchange one type of bacteriophage (a virus against bacteria) with another one to counter possible resistance of bacteria. We are also interested in the release profiles of biological moieties from materials. Formulating rules on how biomolecules release from materials, e.g., depending on the charge and density of the material and the environmental conditions, will allow us to produce slow-release systems, e.g., drug- delivery systems with high adaptability to emerging diseases. Eric Cochran - My research group combines the principles of thermodynamics with polymer chemistry to design new polymeric materials that possess advanced characteristics currently unavailable from the modern commodity plastics industry. Of various types of systems, we commonly use the thermodynamics of phase separation to create highly ordered structures with feature sizes from 10-100 nm (a nanometer is 1 billionth of a meter). The applications in which we are interested vary from flame resistant materials, to highly elastic materials, to high performance fuel cell membranes, to liquid crystal display technologies, or even controlled drug delivery. Rodney Fox - Computation and modeling of turbulent reacting flows and fluid dynamics applied to the chemical process industry, applied mathematics with emphasis on stochastic processes, and high- end computing and visualization engineering applications. Kurt Hebert - Many materials used in structures and devices are intrinsically reactive with their environments and depend on thin surface film, formed by oxidation, for protection against degradation by corrosion. When corrosion does initiate on oxide- covered metals, it is typically confined to sites where the corrosion rate is very high. Our research goal is to develop a fundamental understanding of critical chemical and physical processes involved in localized corrosion to effectively control it. James Hill - We study problems of turbulent transport and mixing using statistical turbulence theory and direct numerical simulations. With the latter, all details of the three- dimensional, unsteady fluid motion are resolved. This work is coupled with laboratory experiments using modern laser diagnostic techniques (PIV and PLIF) to validate computational fluid dynamics (CFD) procedures. Andrew Hillier - My research group performs exploratory experimental studies that encompass topics from chemistry, materials science, catalysis, electrochemistry and interfacial engineering. Our activities focus on combinatorial experimental systems, fuel cell catalysts, responsive polymer membranes, synthesis and characterization of new materials, and the application of in-situ imaging techniques for characterization of the structure and chemistry of solid-liquid interfaces. Laura Jarboe - Our research is focused on the engineering of biological systems. This includes modifying biological systems to do something useful, such as produce biorenewable compounds or increasing our understanding of how these biological systems work. Work is particularly focused on the sensitivity of bacteria to inhibitory compounds. Overcoming this inhibition is important for the economically viable production of biorenewable fuels and chemicals. Duane Johnson - Theoretical materials chemistry and physics, surface and supported nanoparticle heterogeneous catalysis, alloy design and characterization, electronic -structure technique develop applications, thermodynamics and multi -scale modeling. Monica Lamm - We use molecular simulation to discover and interpret fundamental relationships between molecular structure and thermodynamic properties in advanced materials used in applications such as pharmaceuticals, electronic and optical devices, environmentally responsive coatings, membrane separations, and energy storage. Wenzhe n Li - We are developing advanced electrocatalytic materials and exploring novel electrocatalytic processes and systems for advancing science and technologies important to clean energy and sustainability needs. Our current research activities include development of advanced electrocatalysts and efficient electrochemical processes, cogeneration of electricity and valuable chemicals from biorenewables, storage of renewable electricity into biofuels from ligocellulosic feedstocks, electrocatalytic reduction o f CO 2 to fuels, electrocatalytic oxygen reduction and evolution, high- performance and low cost alkaline membrane fuel cells with biorenewable fuels, and mathematical modeling of fuel cells and electrolysis cells. 31 Surya Mallapragada - We develop and invest igate polymeric biomaterials and bioinspired materials for drug delivery, tissue engineering, and gene delivery. Balaji Narasimhan - Nanoscale manipulation of polymer surfaces/interfaces, engineered biomaterials, controlled drug/protein/vaccine delivery, combinatorial materials science. Matthew Panthani - Our experimental research group focuses on studying nanomaterial assemblies for electronic and optoelectronic applications. In particular we are interested in size- and surface- tunable material properti es, assembling ordered arrays of electronically coupled nanomaterials, and integration of nanomaterials into electronic devices. This multidisciplinary research finds applications in photovoltaics, sensors, lighting, biotechnology, catalysis and spintronic s. Derrick Rollins - Our research involves informatics, mathematical modeling and process control in biomedical engineering, material science, non-destructive evaluation (NDE), and data mining. A biomedical engineering focus is in diabetes clinical resear ch modeling the glucose response of type 1 and type 2 diabetics with the goal of improved glucose control. We are developing non-invasive monitoring systems and an artificial pancreas based on control technology and modeling. We are modeling the human thermoregulatory system to diagnose human health and diseases to improve health. Our data mining work focuses on applying multivariate statistical methods to improve identification of critical genes in a number of health science and biotechnology applications. We are developing NDE test methods to determine the ballistic integrity of armor for solders and vehicles. Ian Schneider - Our research group is interested in understanding fundamental cellular behavior that drives the progression of disease states. This behavior includes cell migration, cell adhesion, and cell-cell communication. We use an array of quantitative biochemistry and microscopy techniques to measure force transmission, protein- protein binding, and protein activation in and around living cells. These measurements are made at subcellular resolution to understand how molecular processes drive cellular behavior. The goal is to use these quantitative experimental observations to guide the development of multiscale mathematical models to aid in the design of therapeutics for, or diagnosis of, pathologies such as cancer metastasis. Brent Shanks - Our group works on the design and synthesis of heterogeneous catalyst systems for efficient chemical reactions. Reaction systems that are of particular interest are conversions leading to biorenewable chemicals and fuels, which can be used to replace nonrenewable fossil fuel-derived chemicals and fuels. We are interested in the selective removal of oxygen in multi - functional molecules and are evaluating the ability to have sufficiently controlled synthesis of catalytic reaction domains at the nanoscale so as to have molecularly well-defined active sites. Jacqueline Shanks - Our research is specialized in metabolic engineering of plant secondary metabolites and in phytoremediation of explosives. Much of metabolic engineering work has focused on the production of indole alkaloids (secondary metabolites with high pharmaceutical value) in Catharanthus roseus hairy root tissue cultures. We have developed quantitati ve tools (NMR, HPLC, etc.) and methodology in determining the sources of flux limitation in indole alkaloid production. The same plant tissue culture system, C. roseus hairy roots, is used as a model system for plant roots in phytoremediation studies. Explosives are widespread and persistent in our environment; plants may be one way to remediate contaminated soil and water. Our research group is determining the metabolic structure and kinetics of the transformation products of trinitrotoluene (TNT) and related nitroaromatic contaminants in plant tissues. Zengyi Shao - My group focuses on designing synthetic biology strategies to enable microbial factories to produce biorenewable chemicals from cheap feedstocks. In addition to Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Escherichia coli, the two most commonly used microorganisms; we are particularly interested in engineering other non-conventional yeast strains with desired features. For example, Pichia stipitis has the highest native ability to ferment xylose, the other major sugar in biomass hydrolysate in addition to glucose; Issatchenkia orientalis shows a very strong tolerance of carboxylic acids, which are important precursors used to synthesize a wide variety of compounds. In addition, we are working on constructing microbial consortia to tackle challenges which cannot be easily solved by single organisms. Lastly, we are building various high- throughput optimization approaches to improve strain robustness from a systematic level. Jean -Philippe Tessonnier - We are an interdisciplinary group developing sustainable solutions for the production of chemicals and energy from renewable feedstock. Specifically, we design novel heterogeneous catalysts at the nanoscale. Current topics include nanocarbons and hierarchical zeolites. R. Dennis Vigil - Our current research is focused on the development of novel photobioreactors that take advantage of hydrodynamic structures to increase the frequency that phototrophic microorganisms experience light/dark cycles, which in turn increases the rate of photosynthesis and light utilization efficiency. We are also working on developing novel techniques, using seismic waves, to mobilize oil trapped in porous rocks. Qun Wang - We research Biomaterials, Intestinal Engineering, Nanotechnology, and Drug Delivery (BIND) to provide innovative solutions and products for human health including evaluation of absorption efficacy of anticancer drug-loaded nanoparticles in intestines. Oral delivery via gastrointestinal tract is the most common drug administration route. Nanomedicine is an efficient formulation for many diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease and colorectal cancer. However, no realistic platform to evaluate the absorption efficacy of nanocarriers to intestines exists. Single intestinal stem cells can build crypt -villus structure in vitro has the great potential to fill this gap. Undergraduate student research will contribute substantially to this blank area. Yue Wu - Our group addresses the energy challenges by the investigation of broadly -defined nanostructured materials. Our highly interdisciplinary research program includes the design, synthesis, characterization, and assembly of nanostructured materials, elucidation of the fundamental electronic, optical, and other physical properties of these materials, and exploration of new science and applications towards the highly -efficient harvest, storage, and conversion of solar and thermal energy. 32 American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE) The professional society for chemical engineering is the American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE). Iowa State University has a very active student chapter, which has gained national recognition through recent awards for its program and leadership and awards won in student paper contests at region al meetings. More than one third of the undergraduates in chemical engineering are members of the student chapter. The objectives of the chapter are to promote the professional development of its members and to contribute to the development of chemical engineering at Iowa State. Membership provides the opportunity to meet other chemical engineering students and the members of the faculty, to learn about the professional experiences of others, and to discuss employment and career possibilities. Meetings will normally be held in the evening at Sweeney Hall. Event information is made available through a member email list and the ISU AIChE Facebook group. Other activities include attending the regional AIChE conference and participating on the ChemE Car team. Club officers present an update to the department at the CBE Awards Banquet. The best time to sign up for membership is at the AIChE fall picnic. Membership dues are $10 per year. If you have any questions about the student chapter, feel free to contac t any of the officers listed below. We are looking forward to seeing you at the meetings.

Last year, more than 1,000 students in the college received awards. Various companies, trade associations, and individuals donate these awards. More information is available online at http://www.engineering.iastate.edu/student -services/scholarships. These awards are based primarily on academic performance and university involvement. The university Student Financial Aid Office, 0210 Beardshear Hall or http://www.financialaid.iastate.edu, handles scholarships based on financial need. To be considered for a College of Engineering Scholarship, the applicant must have attended Iowa State University for a period of one semester prior to spring semester and must have at least two semesters remaining in which to use the award starting in the fall semester. The number of scholarships available for freshmen is limited so the majority of the awards are made for use during the student's junior or senior years. Applications must be submitted online and are normally due by February 1. For additional information, please contact Jane Stowe at 294- 9295 or jmstowe@iastate.edu or Tina Prouty at 294 -8678 or tnprouty@iastate.edu 34 Loans Students interested in obtaining an education loan should contact the Office of Studen t Financial Aid, Room 0210 Beardshear Hall. Information about the requirements and arrangements for taking out a loan are best handled directly with personnel from this office. Part-Time Employment In addition to jobs available to students throughout the university, there are many part-time jobs available in CBE. The CBE department seeks research helpers and student assistants. Research Helpers CBE department faculty members employ undergraduate research helpers during the summer, fall, and spring for projects. Ames Laboratory also employs some summer research assistants. Normally these positions require a person with at least a sophomore standing. The work is widely varied since the primary function of the research helper is assisting graduate students with their projects. Typical functions include performing chemical analysis, constructing equipment, taking data, and reducing data. Through this type of work, the student has an opportunity to gain valuable professional experience using modern equipment and research techniques. Student Assistants The CBE department employs eight to 10 students per semester as student assistants to serve primarily as paper graders. Normally the student must be a junior or senior. Aside from providing income, this work gives the assistant a valuable review of basic chemical engineering gained through following the solutions and errors of others. For additional information, please contact DeAnn Pitman , dpitman@iastate.edu. Cooperative (Work -School) Program The CBE depart ment conducts a cooperative program with a number of chemical processing companies. The program provides an opportunity for students enrolled in chemical engineering to gain practical experience while working toward their B.S. degrees. Co-op work arrangem ents are with companies located throughout the U.S., but the majority are in Iowa and Minnesota. The five-year program calls for alternate semesters of school and work experience primarily during the sophomore and junior years. Participating companies make employment offers after conducting interviews with the students. Students need to register with Engineering Career Services to schedule interviews on CyHire, https://cyhire.iastate.edu/students . Advantages of the program are that students: Increase competitive edge for full-time employment Enhance career exploration and clarification of professional goals Develop greater responsibility and self-confidence Improve interpersonal and communication skills Create a process of development, assessment, and continuous professional growth Maintain full-time student status without tuition and fees Reflect work experience on transcript Earn money to cover much of their college expenses Complement classroom learning with practical work experience Disadvantages include: Loss of continuity in some course sequences because of the periodic interruption of work Possible limitations in participating in some outside activities Lengthening of program 35 During the year, meetings to describe the co-op program will be sponsored by Engineering Career Services and some companies. Interviews for co-op positions will be scheduled with the participating companies in both the fall and spring semesters. Interested students who have the necess ary qualifications should discuss this with their advisor. The co-op advisor, Brenda Kutz, 2162B Sweeney Hall, also is available if you have questions or concerns. The process is explained fully on the Engineering Career Services website (http://www.engineering.iastate.edu/ecs). The Student Services Center staff can assist with necessary paperwork. The following are some of the companies who currently take chemical engineering co-ops from Iowa State Univers ity: 3M, Caterpillar, Dow Corning, Equistar, Fisher Rosemount, General Mills, IBM, Intel, and Procter & Gamble. Internships During the freshman and sophomore years, intern opportunities in industry are limited so the best employment opportunity for students is normally in their local community. After the sophomore year, more internships become available for either fall or spring terms. Information is posted on the Engineering Career Services webpage (http://www.engineering.iastate.edu/ecs). The Fall and Spring Engineering Career Fairs are excellent opportunities to pursue job opportunities. The Student Services Center staff can assist with necessary paperwork. An industrial work experience is an excellent opportunity for students to observe first-hand the type of positions held by chemical engineers. Some students return to their employer for permanent employment after graduation; however, neither the employer nor employee is under any obligation to exten d the work experience to permanent employment. There are many opportunities for summer work with various governmental agencies, both state and federal. Since many of these agencies do not recruit on campus, Engineering Career Services maintains an up-to-date file of opportunities on its website (http://engineering.iastate.edu/ecs). Students gain experience in the applications of the principles studied in the classroom, which will make subsequent coursework more meaningful. Process for Relevant Work Experiences 1. Students must print out and complete the Employment Acceptance Form found on this website: http://www.engineering.iastate.edu/ecs/internships/how -to-register 2. Meet with your academic adviser to discuss eligibility, possible impacts on your plan of study, and to obtain the required signature for verification. 3. The form is then returned to Engineering Career Services. The student will be provided the appropriate course reference number for registration. Engineering Career Services encourages all students who participate in relevant work experiences to register the experience with their office. Among other benefits, this opportunity allows students to maintain full-time student status without incurring tuition or fees. The work experience is registered as a Satisfactory/Fail course and requires the student to take additional responsibilities about their learning outcomes and performance. Be sure to look at the Course Syllabus (http://www.engineering.iastate.edu/ecs/internships/how -to- register. The Course Syllabus provides all of the deadlines, forms, and information that you need to know and complete to earn an \"S\" for the work experience. 36 Part 4: Preparing for the Future 37 Permanent Employment By your last year, you should have a career objective in mind. You are encouraged to set up a CyHire account and utilize the many resources available to you: http://www.cyhire.iastate. edu/students . View companies who are recruiting and hiring qualified students and identify the companies that you feel most closely meet your career objectives and values. You should try to learn as much about these companies as you can. You can use The Thomas Register of American Manufacturers or Moody's Manuals , available company literature located in the Engineering Career Services Office, and links to companies available in CyHire. Do not overlook state and federal agencies when seeking permanent em ployment. The various pollution control and environmental protection agencies, for example, offer unique opportunities for chemical engineering graduates. Throughout the academic year, Engineering Career Services offers seminars on the interviewing proces s. Take full advantage of the services offered by this office; they are experts in the placement process. View a list of the current Engineering Career Services Career Development Seminars and Workshops at http://www.engineering.iastate.edu/ecs/careerdevelopmentworkshops . Feel free to discuss with them interviewing problems that you may encounter. Get all the help you can in selling yourself to the interviewer. Start interviewing as soon as possible in the fall. You will gain confidence with experience. Download presentations and handouts anytime at the Career Development Seminars and Workshops webpage. Arrange on-site interviews so that you miss as few classes as possible. Of course, you are expec ted to inform your instructors of travel plans before you leave and to make up all assignments. Many of your interviews can be scheduled between semesters. When you seek employment, it is common practice for prospective employers to ask you for faculty references. It is expected that you will contact the faculty member before you give his or her name as a reference. Make sure that references you choose know something positive about you. Provide references with a copy of your resume. Questions typically found on reference requests include the following: Does the student finish assignments on time? Do the assignments show evidence of extra thought or effort? How does the student react to criticism? What is the student's attitude toward safety practices? Graduate Study in Chemical and Biological Engineering Chemical engineering students frequently discover that there is much to be learned about chemical engineering beyond what is taught in the undergraduate courses. Part of the purpose of graduate study (M.Engr., M.S., and Ph.D.) is to further develop the fundamental theories presented at the undergraduate level; many ISU students pursue graduate work for this reason. An equally important purpose is to give the student an opportunity to plan, undertake, analyze, and report on an independent research project. Graduate study also may qualify the student for employment opportunities that require more technical knowledge and research experience than what is acquired at the undergraduate level. A comprehensi ve resource for students thinking about going to graduate school is available at http://www.gradschools.com . This website has information about various schools and about the Graduate Record Examinat ion (GRE), along with other valuable information. A different website that has more detailed information specifically about chemical engineering graduate programs in the country is maintained by the Council for Chemical Research at http://www.ccrhq.org. Students interested in pursuing graduate studies in Biomedical Engineering should refer to http://www.whitaker.org . Students thinking about pursuing graduate studies should try to become involved in undergraduate research. At Iowa State, research credits can be earned through CH E 490 or CH E 490H. Up to six credits of independent study or research can be used towards their professional, engineering, or CH E elective 38 requirements. Summer research opportunities are also available at Iowa State. Students interested in pursuing summer research opportunities at other schools should visit http://www.nsf.gov/crssprgm/reu/reu _search.cfm for a list of the National Science Foundation Research Experience for Undergraduates sites. Research and teaching assistantships or fellowships are widely available to qualified students for graduate study in chemical engineering. Typical PhD stipends at Iowa State provide more than $2,300 per month in addition to tuition. There also are several competitive fellowships such as the National Science Foundation, the Tau Beta Pi, and other graduate fellowships for which students may apply. Appli cation forms for admission to graduate study at Iowa State are available at http://www.admissions.iastate.edu/graduate/index.php. The application deadlines are February 1 for the fall semester and October 1 for the spring semester. A list of current research areas of the CBE faculty at Iowa State is also available on the CBE website at http://www.cbe.iastate.edu/research/. Preparation for Non- Engineering Graduate Study Chemical engineering graduates are favorably received by medical, law, and business schools. Some planning is required to ensure that you have taken the courses required by admissions committees for those programs. In addition to reading the information below, students interested in law or medicine should visit with LAS Pre- professional advisers in Catt Hall (http://www.las.iastate.edu/pre- health or http://www.las.iastate.edu/pre- law). Students interested in a MBA should visit with the Business Graduate Program Office in the Gerdin Business Building (http://www.business.iastate.edu/masters/mba). Medical School General requirements (in addition to the normal chemical engineering requirements) include: Organic Chemistry Laboratories - CHEM 331L, CHEM 332L, 1 cr. each, and Principles of Biology - BIOL 211 (3), BIOL 211L (1), BIOL 212 (3), 212L e.g., BIOL 314 (3), 335 (4), BIOL 351 (5), or BIOL 423 (3); is required by the University of Iowa College of Medicine. Some of these courses may be used to satisfy the Professional Elective requirement. Additional relevant courses that would apply to the technical elective requirements are the biologically -related chemical engineering courses such as CH E 415, CH E 427, CH E 440, or CH E 562. Note that you may need to begin taking these courses earlier in your program than as the Professional Electives are indicated on our flow chart. Business School (MBA) Most MBA programs are set up to take students coming from non-business programs and have no specific requirements. However, such courses as ECON 101 and ECON 102, which fulfill SSH elective requirements, as well as a course in statistics, which may count as a Statistical Elective, are highly recommended. Courses in accounting, management, or finance would provide a head start and can be taken as extra electives, which would not count towards a B.S. chemical engineering degree. Law School Law schools generally have no specific course requirements, but do look for courses where the student would have had writing and speaking experience, particularly where the topic required critical appraisal of material. Such courses often may be used as SSH electives. For example, students have found that PHIL 206, Introduction to Logic and Scientific Reasonin g, is helpful in preparing for the Law School Admissions Test (LSAT). 39 "}
