Homeopathy is a branch of medicine based on the philosophy that the body is able to safely and effectively heal itself through natural means. This allows our team to provide you with products, materials and procedures that are biocompatible and do not cause negative effects on your oral and overall health. We will even conduct a serum biocompatibility test to make certain that all products and materials used will be beneficial for your use. Our team may prescribe the use of certain homeopathic remedies and treatments for a variety of symptoms such as nerve pain, bone trauma, gum soreness or anxiety. Be sure that any use of these substances is performed under the direction of your dentist, Dr. Marla Wilson, and her team, and that you use each remedy according to instructions and discontinue use once symptoms abate.

General Guidelines to Increase the Effectiveness of Homeopathic Remedies - Do not handle homeopathic remedies with your hands. They should be taken from the container directly into the mouth. - Homeopathic medicines should be taken sublingually (placed under the tongue until they dissolve). - Do not eat anything for at least 20 minutes before or after taking a homeopathic remedy. - Try to stay away from coffee, tea and mint while taking a homeopathic remedy as these may neutralize the effects of the medicines. - Once your symptoms start to go away, cease your homeopathic treatment.
