As a result, Kyle and I actively research alternative non-toxic methods for each of the processes we offer in our shop. When we started in 2009 we knew we wanted to offer copper plate etching. This meant researching and learning a non-toxic etching option. Through our research we discovered acrylic resist hard ground and ferric chloride etching. This non-toxic etching process has been our preferred system for the past eight years. In this post we are happy to share with you what we have learned. Below is a video showing the printing process of Kyle's [Chemistry](https://sparkboxstudio.com/product/etching-chemistry/) print. FAREWELL TRADITIONAL PROCESS Traditional hard ground etching begins by applying a wax ground or painting on a liquid hard ground. Both of these options contain hazardous vapors, often Naptha or Asphaltum and can be a cancer risk. Additionally, you clean these materials using solvents. When the wax hardens the artist uses a metal etching tool to draw their image into the wax. Next the plate is put into an etching solution. This is most commonly nitric acid which is another hazardous substance. The wax acts as a barrier between the copper and the etching solution resulting in only the drawn areas to be etched. While this process can be done safely in the right conditions, in our opinion, working with a more sustainable and less toxic system is beneficial to both our health and the studio. HELLO NEW PROCESS We love the website [nontoxicprint.com](http://www.nontoxicprint.com/), it's filled with amazing information and step by step guides to non toxic printing methods. Because of this website, we discovered acrylic resist etching and the [Edinburgh Etching Solution](http://www.nontoxicprint.com/etchcopperandbrass.htm). We know that not every experiment works and many trials were done before finding the right recipe. The most difficult part in non-toxic etching is finding the right hard ground. Because using the wrong solution, or applying the ground poorly can result in the ground chipping or altogether falling off. We prepare plates by lightly sanding with steel wool and de-grease using soy sauce. If the plate isn't completely free of grease, the oil content repels the water-based ground. Afterwards we paint the ground on using a foam brush in two thin coats. The first layer is a pure solution of Future Floor Wax. Followed by a second layer containing a mixture of Future Floor Wax and India ink. This gives our plates a slight to moderate tone increasing the contrast when drawing through the ground. In addition, you can make the plate darker by adding a third layer of black gouache after the ground has significantly dried. The Edinburgh Etching solution is made with ferric chloride, citric acid and water, which is a safer alternative to nitric acid. We have been using our tank for the past eight years and find that the etching time is almost the same as the day we made it. It takes 35 min to get a deep etch. The etch time can be altered with different ratios of water to ferric chloride. WHAT WE LOVE ABOUT THIS PROCESS 1. Best of all, we have no solvents in our studio therefore no crazy smells. 2. Our etching solution gives off no toxic vapors and as a result has no potential for violent reactions if there is a spill. 3. Studio clean up is easy and safe. First, the ground is removed with water and sodium carbonate (washing soda). Second, the etching solution dilutes with washing soda and water. Finally, our inks can be cleaned with vegetable oil and vinegar. 4. We never worry about destroying our lungs or accidentally creating toxic gases like we would with nitric acid. 5. In conclusion, when comparing both traditional and contemporary non-toxic etching processes we notice little difference in the final product.
