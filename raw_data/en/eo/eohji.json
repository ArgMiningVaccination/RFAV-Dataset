[Big Data Analysis of Synchrophasor Data](https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/view-opportunity.html?oppId=309255) Department of Energy, National Energy Technology Laboratory Closing Date: November 9, 2018 This program aims to explore the use of artificial intelligence (AI) tools on PMU data to identify and improve existing knowledge, and to discover new insights and tools for better grid operation and management. [Learning with Less Labels (LwLL)](https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/view-opportunity.html?oppId=308023) Department of Defense, DARPA - Information Innovation Office Closing Date: November 2, 2018 DARPA is soliciting innovative research proposals in the area of machine learning and artificial intelligence. Proposed research should investigate innovative approaches that enable revolutionary advances in science, devices, or systems. [Mind, Machine and Motor Nexus](https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/view-opportunity.html?oppId=306168) National Science Foundation Closing Date: Proposals accepted anytime The Mind, Machine and Motor Nexus (M3X) program supports fundamental research at the intersection of mind, machine and motor. A distinguishing characteristic of the program is an integrated treatment of human intent, perception, and behavior in interaction with embodied and intelligent engineered systems and as mediated by motor manipulation. M3X projects should advance the holistic analysis of cognition and of embodiment as present in both human and machine elements. This work will encompass not only how mind interacts with motor function in the manipulation of machines, but also how, in turn, machine response and function may shape and influence both mind and motor function. [Development of Socially-Assistive Robots (SARs) to Engage Persons with Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and AD-Related Dementias (ADRD), and their Caregivers (R41/R42)](https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/view-opportunity.html?oppId=291124) Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health Closing Date: April 5, 2020 The purpose of this Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) FOA is to encourage small businesses and their research partners to develop assistive robotics and related technology that would enhance health and reduce illness and disability in older Americans suffering from Alzheimer's Disease (AD), AD-related dementias (ADRD), and other comorbidities. In addition, this FOA encourages small businesses and their research partners to develop assistive robotics addressing the needs and conditions of caregivers to older Americans suffering from AD and ADRD. [National Robotics Initiative 2.0: Ubiquitous Collaborative Robots](https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/view-opportunity.html?oppId=298941) National Science Foundation Closing Date: February 5, 2019 The NRI-2.0 program builds upon the original National Robotics Initiative (NRI) program to support fundamental research in the United States that will accelerate the development and use of collaborative robots (co-robots) that work beside or cooperatively with people. The focus of the NRI-2.0 program is on ubiquity, which in this context means seamless integration of co-robots to assist humans in every aspect of life. The program supports four main research thrusts that are envisioned to advance the goal of ubiquitous co-robots: scalability, customizability, lowering barriers to entry, and societal impact. "}
