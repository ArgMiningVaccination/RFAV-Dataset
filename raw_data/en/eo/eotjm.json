In chiropractic we have always known the importance of a strong immune system to help fight any kind of threat to our bodies. Many of my patients are asking about what high quality supplements boost the immune function. The four common recommendations I make on a daily basis for supporting overall immune function are from Ortho Molecular: 1. Vitamin D3 (with K2) Vitamin D3 has a well documented history in boosting immune function and preventing respiratory illness. Vitamin D has anti-inflammatory, immunoregulatory properties and is crucial for the activation of immune system defenses. It is known to enhance the function of immune cells, including T-cells and macrophages that protect you body against pathogen, including viruses. I recommend Ortho Molecular D3 with K2 because it is high quality/emulsified vitamin D3 combined with a clinically researched vitamin K2 that not only helps increase the absorption of vitamin D3, but benefits cardiovascular and bone health. 2. Probiotics Probiotics are commonly discussed for their gastrointestinal benefits, but they can also have a very impactful immune benefit. It is often discussed that about 70% of the immune system is located in the gut. Our GI track is line with immune cells and markers that greatly impact our overall health. Taking a therapeutically dosed and diverse probiotic can not only help boost key immune markers, but also help with the removal of harmful pathogens. The probiotic I recommend is called Ortho Biotic, is contains a blend of some of the worlds most well-researched probiotic strains. 3. Zinc Zinc is well known for it's immune boosting and antiviral properties. Several clinical studies link zinc to prevention of viral replication and for shortening duration of viral symptoms. Zinc is currently being used across the country in combination with several prescription medications to help combat the major viral issues currently impacting our country, taking daily zinc supplement can help play a key role in boosting immune function. Not all Zinc is created equal though. I recommend a chelated zinc bisglycinate called Reacted Zinc from ortho molecular This form of Zinc has been clinically shown to be 390% better absorbed than zinc oxide and 230% better than zinc sulfate. 4. Vitamin C Vitamin C is a water soluable vitamin most widely known for its role in supporting immune health. It provides potent antioxidant protection, as it helps combat cellular damage from free radicals caused by oxidative stress. I recommend Ortho Molecular Buffered C Powder, it is balanced with calcium, magnesium and potassium to gently deliver high concentration vitamin C to reduce the potential of gastrointestinal upset. All of these immune boosting products, listed in this article, can be found at [Ortho Molecular Products](https://us.fullscript.com/welcome/pulsechiro). Please let me know if you have any questions!
