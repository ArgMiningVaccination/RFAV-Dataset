It focuses on addressing the underlying causes of a disease rather than just treating the symptoms. At Hands On Health Wellness Center in Carrollton, we use this approach to look at the whole person, including their lifestyle and environmental factors. Functional medicine is not just another fad diet or supplements program. It is a family practice that uses alternative and integrative medicine to treat the whole person, not just the symptoms. Functional medicine is a holistic care approach rooted in the belief that the body has an innate ability to heal itself. When this ability is impaired, diseases can occur. Functional medicine practitioners work to identify and address the underlying causes of the disease. When you visit our wellness center, we can use functional medicine to treat a variety of conditions, including: Functional medicine can help address the underlying causes of chronic pain, such as inflammation, nerve damage, and imbalances in the body's natural pain-killing chemicals. It can also improve pain management through integrative techniques such as acupuncture, chiropractic care, and massage therapy. Fatigue is a common symptom of many conditions, including adrenal fatigue, anemia, and autoimmune disorders. Functional medicine can help identify and address the underlying causes of fatigue and provide integrative treatments to improve energy levels and vitality. Autoimmune disorders occur when the body's immune system attacks healthy tissues. This can lead to many symptoms, including fatigue, pain, and inflammation. We will discover the underlying causes of the autoimmune disorder and provide treatments to improve your symptoms. Functional medicine can be used to address the underlying causes of digestive disorders, such as food sensitivities, gastrointestinal infections, and imbalances in the gut microbiome. It can also improve symptom management through integrative techniques such as massage therapy, acupuncture, and chiropractic care. Arthritis is a common condition that causes pain, stiffness, and swelling in the joints. Functional medicine can address the underlying causes of arthritis, such as inflammation, joint damage, and imbalances in the body's natural pain-killing chemicals. At Hands On Health Wellness Center in Carrollton, we offer integrative and alternative medicine services to treat the whole person, not just their symptoms. Our family practice uses functional medicine to look at the underlying causes of a disease and provide integrative treatments to improve the patient's overall health and wellness.
