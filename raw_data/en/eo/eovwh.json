Our Briefcase _______ _ Two Deeades of IntergovernDlental Polley It is no secret that the size of U.S. Government, at all levels has increased in the last two debades. Federal domestic expenditures and outlays of State and local govern\u00ad ments grew from 15.9 percent of the GNP in 1959 to 25.9 percent in 1979. The increased spending reflects the entry of government into areas for\u00ad merly ignored or left largely to the private sector (environment, anti\u00ad discrimination) or expanded gov\u00ad ernment efforts in areas in which it once played a much smaller role (housing, health). The Advisory Commission on In\u00ad tergovernmental Relations (ACIR) used its recent 20th birthday to report. on government trends be\u00ad tween 1959 and 1979 (in an article by Carl W. Stenberg, appearing in the Winter 1980 issue of Inter\u00ad governmental Perspectives). ACIR reported that this trend was accompanied by an increased real tax burden for the middle class ~xpanded regulatory acfivity and Increased numbers of government employees. The report was not all negative. ACIR noted that the use of Federal grants has supported local activities to solve social and physical prob\u00ad lems and to aid new programs. The Federal Government has also played a large role in coordinating activi\u00ad ties and encouraging improvement of reciepients' organizational ar\u00ad rangements, personnel systems and planning and management cap\u00ad abilities. The courts played an ex\u00ad tensive role in intergovernmental affairs during these decades. The Supreme Court decision on Baker v. Carr ended rural dominance of state legislatures, while Serrano v. Priest led to reorganization of school finance systems to' embody the principal of equity in funding! service delivery. Other major trends noted by ACIR were increased lobbying on government issues, growing num\u00ad bers of regional organizations and heighten ing competition associated with the so-called \"sunbeltl frost\u00ad belt\" controversy. At the same GAO Review / Summer 1980 ously those of local governments; and 4) changing focus of Federal assistance, as Federal aid is used __ ,....-_~ __ to subsidize general operations of time, citizens clearly want their governments to be more account\u00ad able, and have demonstrated this through calls for balanced budgets and tax reform. While GAO has done much work on the many Federal programs geared to State and local govern\u00ad ments, the General Government Division also has a staff devoted to broad intergovernmental issues. A 1979 report, \"Perspectives on Inter\u00ad governmental Policy and Fiscal Re\u00ad lations\" (GGD-79-62), outlined GAO's work in the area, gave the Office's perspectives on some of the major issues, and offered a forecast of future developments and trends shaping the intergovern\u00ad mental agenda. GAO's work in the area is grouped into four basic research areas. One area concerns the need to standardize and simplify Federal assistance administrative require\u00ad ments. Another centers on the need to improve Federal, State, area\u00ad wide, and local coordination. A third addresses the methods used to distribute Federal assistance to State and local governments, and includes contracts, grants, loans, revenue sharing and technical as\u00ad sistance. A' final research area assesses intergovernmental fiscal interaction and associated prob\u00ad lems. GAO sees four sets of trends which will affect future develop\u00ad ments in the intergovernmental sys\u00ad tem. These are: 1) increased man\u00ad agement reform, as executive and legislative bodies at all levels try to get a hand Ie on the maze of Federal assistance programs; 2) structural changes, as the competing pres\u00ad sures for fragmentation and central\u00ad ization are sorted out; 3) further extension of Federal involvement in State and local affairs, as Federal assistance goes to more local gov\u00ad ernment units for purposes previ-State and local governments on a continuing basis (e.g., highway maintenance) rather than encourag\u00ad ing new efforts in areas of Federal priority. The report notes it is too early to tell whether efforts to balance the Federal budget will drastically change the role of the Federal government in providing financial assistance to State and local gov\u00ad ernments. However, it postulates that a realistic short-term forecast may be one of growth in Federal assistance programs, but at a much slower rate than over the past two decades. Copies of the GAO report may be obtained from Room 1518 of the GAO Building. The Winter 1980 issue of Intergovernmental Perspec\u00ad tives is available from the Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations, Washington, D.C. 20578. IDlpleDlenting Personnel Changes October 1, 1980, will usher in many changes in the personnel structure used in GAO. Some aspects of the changes are dis\u00ad cussed below. New Personnel SysteDl As October 1, 1980 draws near, staff of the GAO Personnel System Project are pushing to develop the processes needed to implement the February 1980 legislation which re\u00ad moved GAO from the executive branch personnel system. While the legislation authorized GAO to es\u00ad tablish its own system, it also provided guidelines for doing this. Within this framework, project head Cliff Gould and staff are to develop merit system princi\u00ad ples and identify \"prohibited personnel practices\" re\u00ad quired by law, design recruitment and placement programs for all prospective and current GAO employees, 1 From Our Briefcase establish a disciplinary ac\u00ad tion and grievance process, establish a GAO Appeals Board to resolve EEO com\u00ad plaints, adverse actions, la\u00ad bor relations issues, and cer\u00ad tain grievances, develop the framework for GAO's Labor-Management Relations Program, and provide the basic elements of GAO's overall EEO pro\u00ad gram. In case this is not enough to keep project staff busy, they will also develop a conceptual personnel system model to guide GAO's future direction. The legislation requires that reg\u00ad ulations establiehing GAO's new personnel system be published in advance. Comments will be sought before the regulations are adopted. Senior Exeeutive Serviee lor GAO The Senior Executive Committee, under guidance of Chairman Jim Martin, has finished much of its work in designing the regulations for GAO's Senior Executive Service. The Service, similar to the one implemented for executive agencies under the Civil Service Reform Act, will become a reality on October 5th. Senior staff (GS-16!17!18 or levels V or IV of the Executive Ser\u00ad vice) may choose to join SES. Their professional careers will be gov\u00ad erned by a new set of personnel rules and regulations, performance requirements, and incentives. Compensation, retention, and tenure of individuals in SES de\u00ad pends on \"executive success,\" measured on the basis of individual and organizational performance. This includes such factors as effic\u00ad iency, productivity, quality of work or service, timeliness of perfor\u00ad mance, and success in meeting equal employment opportunity goals. The pay of SES members will be more closely related to their perfor\u00ad mance, as well as their jobs. Pay can be increased periodically to reward good performance, and in\u00ad dividuals can qualify for cash bonuses and ranks-awarded on the basis of performance. SES members may also qualify for sab\u00ad batical leave of up to 11 months, 2 and are only partially subject to annual leave accrual ceilings. Indi\u00ad viduals who do not measure up may be removed from SES and returned to a GS-15 position. The SES order also provides for education and training programs for SES members and candidates. The Executive Improvement Program will offer SES members courses, workshops, and other internal and external continuing education pro\u00ad grams to keep their managerial skills sharp. Individuals in GS-15 pOSitions may qualify for the Executive Candidate Program. Each person in the program will be assigned a \"mentor\"-an SES member who will serve as a counselor and will help design an educational program tailored to the candidate's individ\u00ad ual needs. The program's curricu\u00ad ium wiii inciude seminars on GAO operations, formal in-house and exte.rnal executive development courses, and aSSignments with staff offices, divisions, and regional offices. Two Boards assist the Comptrol\u00ad ler General, who has overall respon\u00ad sibility for administering SES. The Executive Resources Board gener\u00ad ally oversees the Service, and is chaired by former Deputy Comptrol\u00ad ler General Robert Keller. Keller is assisted by six SES members, who must be at the division director level or above. The director of Per\u00ad sonnel is an ex officio member. The Qualifications and Perfor\u00ad mance Review Board identifies can\u00ad didates for entry into SES and certifies their qualifications. It also reviews performance contracts and ratings of most SES members and recommends performance ratings and nominees for bonuses and executive ranks. Chairman Greg Ahart is assisted by seven other senior GAO staff. To assure input from those GAO staff most immediately affected by the new Service, Martin sent the draft order to GS-16s and above and the heads of GAO's advisory groups for comment. GS-15s also received a summary. The revised order was approved by Mr. Staats. New Job Series Approved Jobs of Federal employees are classified on the basis of their duties, responsibilities, and qualifi\u00ad cation requirements to conform with standards and guidelines es\u00ad tablished by the U.S. Office of Per\u00ad sonnel Management (OPM). The standards define the occupation, explain significant factors in evalu\u00ad ating positions, and define work characteristics of various grade levels. Given the somewhat unique na\u00ad ture of GAO's work, GAO developed and OPM approved a single agency series-the\u00b7 \"GAO Evaluator\" series-to define the work of GAO auditors! evaluators. The Single agency series was developed con\u00ad currently with efforts to move GAO into the excepted service. The standard is neither more lenient nor more strict than those now used (GS-510 Accountant and GS-343 Management Analyst! Audi\u00ad tor), but is more relevant to the way GAO operates. It will make it easier to credit important aspects of the agency's work which were either not covered or considered ancillary in the previous standards. To determine which of GAO's professional\u00b7staff will be converted to the new series, the Personnel Office has asked each division and office to list their \"specialist\" and \"general ist\" staff. SpeCialists, in\u00ad cluding accountants performing ac\u00ad counting work, will be classified appropriately. Generalists will be converted to the GAO Evaluator series under a mass change action, tentatively scheduled for the begin\u00ad ning of fiscal year 1981. This coincides with the conversion of all GAO employees to GAO's new per\u00ad sonnel system. After the conver\u00ad sion, position descriptions now used will be abolished and new ones, reflecting language in the GAO Evaluator classification criter\u00ad ia, will be substituted. Publie Management Researeh Agenda lor Aetion Needed What is one topic on which the heads of the Office of Personnel Management, Office of Manage\u00ad ment and Budget, General Services Administration and General Ac\u00ad counting Office can agree? All are concerned that there are no good means to encourage applying and validating existing research from a GAO Review/Summer 1980 variety of fields to public sector management. They also realize there is no way to stimulate wide\u00ad spread cross-disciplinary interest in new and innovative research specif\u00ad ically oriented to the public sector. To address these concerns, the four central management agencies sponsored a November 1979 confer\u00ad ence on public management re\u00ad search at the Brookings Institution in Washington, D.C. Participants included a group of leaders in re\u00ad search from a broad spectrum of disciplines, who jOined representa\u00ad tives of Federal agencies, State and local public interest groups and private foundations. The 2-day con\u00ad ference was a combination of presentations on public manage\u00ad ment research and small group working sessions. It was opened by addresses by the heads of the four agencies, including Comptroller General Staats. As OPM Director Alan Campbell noted, a major dilemma of public management research is that sub\u00ad stantive areas dominate the re\u00ad search focus even though problems in these areas frequently are of a generic management nature. Partic\u00ad ipant Harlan Cleveland described nel funded by one-year appropria\u00ad tions.\" Those who participated in the small-gFoup discussions focused their discussion on the different perspectives presented in the three major conference papers. Opinions varied as to the components of such research, who should conduct it and how widely results could be applied. A chief caution was that too heavy a Federal involvement in the research process could. dampen its effect, thus perhaps the need for some kind of institute or other organization to lead the effort. Whoever leads the effort, they agreed research needs to be practi\u00ad cal and able to be applied on the job. This cautionary note to the academic community highlighted the need for strong links between sponsor, user and researcher. Having obtained the input of such an illustrious group, the question to be faced is \"Where do we go from here?\" As a next step, GAO ReView/Summer 1980 the four sponsoring agencies VYill consider the issues raised at the conference and summarized in its report, Setting Public Management Research Agendas: Integrating the Sponsor, Producer and User. The Office of Personnel Management also plans to publish a report in 1980 which will enumerate what it thinks can be done and what it plans to do in the public manage\u00ad ment research arena. Want to learn more about what was discussed at the conference? Single copies of the report may be obtained from the Office of Person\u00ad nel Management, 1900 E Street, N.W., Room 3305, Washington, D.C. 20415. Congressman Prondes Distriet with News A constituent recently sent Con\u00ad gressman Jim Mattox of Texas a news clipping on GAO's efforts to combat fraud and waste in Federal programs. The bold message print\u00ad ed on the back asked, \"Does anything more need to be saTa'?\" The Congressman was concerned, because it was obvious the sender did not realize GAO was part of the Congress, and that these efforts to uncover and help rectify fraud and waste were being undertaken by a legislative arm of Government. To help educate his constituents about GAO and its role, Congress\u00ad man Mattox issued a news release describing the clipping he received and the efforts GAO makes to promote more efficient Govern\u00ad ment. He reminded his readers that GAO's operating expenses for 1979 were$181 million, while it saved the Government $2.6 billion. The re\u00ad lease also let readers know that GAO's work is not purely finanCial, and that it is undertaken as. a resu It of congressional requests, statu\u00ad tory requirements and GAO initia\u00ad tives. The Congressman reminded read\u00ad ers that, as a direct result of con\u00ad gressional interest, GAO operates the nationwide fraud hotline (800- 424-5454), which allows anyone in the U.S.A. to contact GAO with information concerning misuse of Federal funds. A tip of. the GAO hat (perhaps we should say green eye shade?) to From Our Briefcase Congressman Mattox for his efforts to educate the general public on GAO's work. GA.O A.s Role Model for A.eeountants As has been done on other occa\u00ad sions, the Review is borrowing from GAO's \"Management News\" (22 April 1980), which wrote about an article discussing the degree of social concern displayed by those in the accounting profession: ''why have accountants lag\u00ad ged behind other profession\u00ad als-lawyers, in particular-in having an impact on society?\" John C. Burton, former chief accountant of the Securities and Exchange Commission and now Arthur Young profes\u00ad sor of accounting and finance at Columbia University, asked in an article in the New York Times, 13 April. \"In the last 25 years a gener\u00ad ation of angry young lawyers has made the legal system the catalyst for social reform. The lawyers have achieved needed (and perhaps unneeded) social change, often bypassing an unresponsive political system. In addition, lawyers have made a significant contribution to the political system, both in service as legislators and in pressure for change through political processes,\" he writes. During this same period, Burton observes, few-account\u00ad ants have been willing to stand for public office or to devote a few career years to government service, or even to take strong public positions on national issues. He cites a 1972 poll which found that, compared to bankers, doctors, engineers, and lawyers, CPAs ranked last in making a vital contribution to society, last in being creative and imaginative, and last in being public\u00ad spirited. \"This image has hampered the accounting profession's ability to recruit young talent,\" Burton says. \"This must be re\u00ad versed if accounting is-to main\u00ad tain and increase its role in society and ultimately its eco\u00ad nomic success as well.\" 3 From Our Briefcase But lawyers can use the courts to effect public policy changes. What can account\u00ad ants do? The concept of audit must be expanded along the lines al\u00ad ready begun by GAO stan\u00ad dards. An auditor must see hislher role as encompas\u00ad sing the evaluation of effec\u00ad tiveness in meeting goals and efficiency in operations as well as simply expressing an opinion on financial statements. Accounting education must be broadened. Accountants should not be seen solely as \"record keepers and checkers.\" Burton argues, \"But measures of economic and social phenomena whose measurements can significant\u00ad ly influence the allocation de\u00ad cisions of our society.\" Burton's article was reproduced in GAO Clippings, 14 April. Computerizing Workpapers Around the World GAO staff have been known to covet working on reports which \"get a lot of mileage.\" Reports which receive a great deal of attention in congressional hearings or the press have a clearly measurable impact on a program. Bill Johnston of the Financial and General Management Studies Division recently learned a GAO Review article he wrote has traveled far. When Assistant Director of Ja\u00ad pan's Board of Audit, Mr. Hirohisa Ushijima, recently visited GAO, he told Bill the article had been trans\u00ad lated into Japanese and published in their counterpart to the Review. The article, \"Computerizing the Pro Forma Workpaper,\" (Summer 1976) had also been published in the International Journal of Govern\u00ad ment Auditing (January 1978), which is where the Japanese actual\u00ad ly saw it. How did the article look? The title and author are shown here. 4 Southern Neighbors Reading ID Report Another GAO effort, this an International Division report, \"Train\u00ad ing and Related Efforts Needed to Improve Financial Management in the Third World,\" (ID-79-46) is receiving much attention outside the U.S. Because fieldwork for the report was done in Latin America, the report was translated in Spanish and distributed to the Comptrollers General in all Spanish-speaking countries in that region. The report carried an important message to the nations themselves and to countries and international organizations which provide assis\u00ad tance to developing countries. It discussed the effect that shortages of trained financial management staff in developing countries have on those countries to produce ac\u00ad curate and timely financial data. The report also presented informa\u00ad tion on the types and levels of training needed to help overcome the problem. The Engfish version of the report is available from the Documents Distribution Office, Room 1518 in the GAO Building, while copies of the Spanish version are being dis\u00ad tributed by the International Divi\u00ad sion (Room 4824). Voss to GPO Comptroller Allen R. Voss, director of the General Government Division, re\u00ad cently accepted the position of the Comptroller of the Government Printing Office. He brings to the position 22 years of distinguished service with GAO. Since joining GAO in 1952, Voss has served in key positions in head\u00ad quarters and regional offices. Among them were his roles as di\u00ad rector, Office of Policy, and man\u00ad ager of the Philadelphia regional office. AI's dedicated service to GAO is reflected in two Meritorious Service Awards and the Distinguished Ser\u00ad vice Award. GAO's loss is GPO's gain! ? -( I) 7 AP. ::; 3 ~ A ~ ~,Jr - GAO Review/Summer Review/Summer 1980 On Loeation _____ _ Staats EstabUshes Institute for Program Evaluation Mid-April 1980 marked a time of organizational change as the Comp\u00ad troller General established an Insti\u00ad tute for Program Evaluation and placed it under the direction of the equally new Assistant Comptroller General for Program Evaluation. Harry S. Havens, director of GAO's Program Analysis Division (PAD), was named to the new Assistant Comptroller General slot. The Insti\u00ad tute Director will be Eleanor Chel\u00ad imsky, Director of the Office of Pro\u00ad gram Evaluation for the MITRE Cor\u00ad poration. This and other changes, imple\u00ad mented simultaneously, were de\u00ad signed to achieve two objectiyes identified by Mr. Staats. The first objective dealt with the need to improve GAO's planning of assign\u00ad ments and the methodology used on them. This includes having avail\u00ad able those skills needed to fulfill GAO's responsibilities and imple\u00ad menting a continuing program to upgrade the skill of GAO staff. Mr. Staats' second objective addressed the need to give special attention to those projects which are clearly or potentially expensive in relation to the resources available, or which deal with subjects or issues which are or may be particularly sensitive or controversial, or which require advanced analytical techniques. In achieving these objectives, Mr. Staats noted GAO needs to main\u00ad tain a balance between require\u00ad ments for some degree of central\u00ad ized planning and decisionmaking, and delegation of responsibility and authority to operating divisions and their respective project team direc\u00ad tors and team leaders. One of the changes instituted was the shift of the Assignment Re\u00ad view Group (which is composed of the three Assistants Comptroller General and two division directors, the latter of whom serve for rotating 1-year terms) from an advisory group to one with the authority to direct a division to alter plans for an assignment. In addition to this re\u00ad view process, the Group would have other responsibil ities, including working with GAO's Office of Program Planning to define mini\u00ad mum information requirements for use in authorizing an assignment to move from one stage to another, and arbitrating those disputes among operating divisions which pertain to responsibility for, or con\u00ad duct of, assignments, The position of Assistant to the Comptroller General for Policy and Program Planning was upgraded to the Assistant Comptroller General level, with some change of duties. ACG John Heller will, among other responsibilities, chair the Assign\u00ad ment Review Group and work with GAO's Office of Public Information to strengthen GAO's products and the public's understanding of the role of GAO. In forming the Institute for Pro\u00ad gram Evaluation, the Comptroller General transferred to it staff from the Program Evaluation Staff of PAD and some from the Financial and General Management Studies Division's Technical Assistance Group. The Institute has many responsibilities regarding develop\u00ad ing and strengthening program evaluation capabilities throughout GAO. It will also develop a pro\u00ad fessional interchange program with other evaluation organizations and maintain a Visiting Committee of evaluation experts. Reeognition to Two Top GAO Sta\" National Civil Serviee League Seleets Fogel Among those chosen to receive one of the 1980 Career Service Awards presented by the National Civil Service League was Richard L. Fogel, Director of GAO's Office of Program Planning. Fogel was nom\u00ad inated by Comptroller General Staats, who commended his efforts and negotiations which helped pave the way for GAO's continuous over\u00ad sight of FBI operations. Mr. Staats also noted that a report on social services submitted by Fogel was GAO's first effort to use statistical analyses to support empirical find\u00ad ings, and became a model for future GAO jobs using systems analysis. 5 On Location Dick Fogel is shown receiving the National Civil Service League Award from League President Bertrand Harding as Comptroller General Staats watches. Mr. Staats also gave the address at the ceremony. Fogel jOins a list of other out\u00ad standing GAO staff who received the award in earlier years. The list includes retired Deputy Comptroller General Robert Keller (1976), retired General Counsel Paul Dembling (1973), and the late Assistant Comptroller General Ellsworth Morse, Jr. (1968). Havens Reeeives Exeeutive Leadership Award Assistant Comptroller General for Program Evaluation, Harry S. Havens, received the Roger W. Jones Award for Executive Leader\u00ad ship in the May honors convocation at American University. The award is presented annually to two Feder\u00ad al career executives who have demonstrated leadership which led to outstanding organizational ach ievements and who have shown commitment to developing man\u00ad agers and executives for govern- ment. . Havens, former director of GAO's Program Analysis Division, was nominated for the award by Comp-troller General Staats. Mr. Staats specifically nominated Havens for leading the way as GAO established new poliCies for conducting analy\u00ad ses and integrated economic analy\u00ad sis with other responsibilities of the agency. OAS Board 01 External Auditors Meets Twiee Chairman and U.S. representative to the Organization of American States Board of External Auditors is Frank Zappacosta of GAO's Interna\u00ad tional Division. Frank has called the group together twice in 1980 (March and May) to deal with its general role of OAS aud it. Among the Board's recent decisions was to open the OAS audit contract for bids. Other members of the Board are Luis Andrade Tafur of Ecuador and Oscar Stark Rivarola of Paraguay. The March meeting was addressed by OAS Secretary General, Alejan\u00ad dro Orfila, who reaffirmed his view on the importance of external audit. He also spoke of the importance of the Board's role in recommending ways to improve OAS operations. OAS Board of External Auditors are, from left, Oscar Stark Rivarola, Paraguay; lO's Frank M.

Office of Management and Budget Circular (A-117), \"Management Improve\u00ad ment and the Use of Evaluation in the Executive Branch,\" emphasizes the importance of the role of evaluation in overall management improvement and the budget pro\u00ad cess. Similar developments are taking place in other countries; for exam\u00ad ple, in Canada, an evaluation policy and advisory group has been estab\u00ad lished in a new office of the Comptroller General, associated with the Treasury Board. This establishes in the Government of Canada a source of evaluation guidance for the various depart\u00ad ments. Departments are estab\u00ad lishing central evaluation functions under the deputy ministers. Studies Keith E. Marvin Mr. Marvin is the associate director for pro\u00ad gram evaluation in the Program Analysis Division. will be conducted using teams drawn from the central staff and the line organization of the program being evaluated. The U.S. Congress is continuing to move toward enactment of over\u00ad sight reform measures covering operating programs and regulatory functions of the Federal Govern\u00ad ment. These measures will require that the various congressional com\u00ad mittees establish oversight review plans, leading to a more systematic basis for evaluations to support these oversight reviews. Congres\u00ad sional support agencies such as the General Accounting Office will be directly involved in performing these evaluations and in assisting the committees on request with their evaluation and review plans. On the legislative side, the Canadian Government has also taken recent steps to provide more evaluation capability in its Office of the Auditor General. This Office is required by a recent AuditorGeneral '7 Trends In Evaluation Act to establish the capability to review the evaluation systems and procedures of Canadian depart\u00ad ments. GAO personnel have met on a number of occasions with person\u00ad nel of the Auditor General's Office and the Canadian Comptroller Gen\u00ad eral's Office for an exchange of views on evaluation methods, eval\u00ad uation training, and the use of evaluation. In addition to such in-depth discussion, GAO has been visited by a number of representa\u00ad tives of other foreign governments interested in learning about the de\u00ad velopment of evaluation methods. What emerges is a common con\u00ad cern among all of these countries and branches of Government in finding ways to measure the effec- 8 tiveness of various public pro\u00ad grams, and providing information to decisionmakers in a more useful fashion. Reflecting this concern, the United Nations Joint Inspection Unit has developed a draft \"Initial Guidelines for Internal Evaluation Systems of United Nations Organi\u00ad zations.\" These guidelines cover, among other things, reporting and followup procedures and informa\u00ad tion requirements. The Judicial Branch of the U.S. Government is also using evalua\u00ad tion and finding special uses for evaluation methods. The 1980 An\u00ad nual Program of the Evaluation Re\u00ad search Society, to be held in Wash\u00ad ington, D.C., November 19-22, will include sessions on the courts' use of evaluation methods. The Soci\u00ad ety's program also illustrates the broad scope of evaluation as viewed by those who do it. Other themes in the program will be the conduct of evaluation, evaluation training, leg\u00ad islative use of evaluation, and accountability of Federal and State agencies. Membership in the Eval\u00ad uation Research Society, an inter\u00ad national organization operating to improve the theory and practice of evaluation for public service, is open to anyone engaged in evalua\u00ad tion or evaluation research. Mem\u00ad bership information may be ob\u00ad tained from Society president Scar\u00ad via B.

GAO Review/Summer 1980 The New York Region: The Apple Still Shines Bill Paller Rudy Plessing Mike Savino Madeline T e1efus GAO Review / Summer 1980 The New York Region: The Apple Still Shines This is the eighth in a series of articles on GAO's regional offices. Woodrow Wilson, at one time a resident of the New York region, said that it normally took him about 2 hours to write a 1 hour speech, but at least a full day to prepare a 5 minute speech. Anyone writing about our region faces a similar problem. It is much easier to ex\u00ad pound for 200 or 300 pages than to condense our region into the space here. There simply is so much that can and should be said-some good and some not. Like any other part of the country, we have our strong points and our problems. But our area clearly has a unique personality and style which makes it a great piace to live and work. And that complex, multifaceted personality, and the forces which have molded it, is what we'd like to talk about. Setting the Seene(ry) An incredibly diverse world be\u00ad gins in the region where the Hudson and East Rivers meet to join the Atlantic Ocean. Consider its diversity: the steel and glass canyons of New York City, the neatly-law ned bedroom communi\u00ad ties of northern New Jersey, the mountainous play lands of central New York, the industrial communi\u00ad ties and farm areas in the western part of the State, and the icy lakes rimming the Canadian border. At its southernmost point, 1,500 miles from New York, our region takes on a tropical flavor-the lush beaches and crystal waters of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The exotic islands and inlets in this part of the region make a pleasant contrast to the hills, mountains, lakes, and rivers of upstate New York and northern New Jersey. Often overlooked is the fact that New York itself is one of the most scenic States in the nation. It pos\u00ad sesses virtually every element of scenic beauty. Forests inhabited by a remark\u00ad able variety of wildlife cover nearly half of the State's 50,000 square miles, providing excellent settings for nearly 200 State parks, or forest 1~ After many decades of relative anonymity, our region is gaining recognition as a vacation playland. With so many natural attributes, all types of recreation are available to suit virtually every taste. Hunting, fishing, and camping can be en\u00ad joyed throughout the region. The athletically minded can participate in the entire spectrum of winter sports in such places as the Adiron\u00ad dack Mountains, site of the 1980 Winter Olympics. Resorts in the Catskill Mountains offer all types of facilities for leisurely daytime sum\u00ad mer activities and cocktail sipping to top-flight entertainment at night. Puerto Rico and the Virgin Is\u00ad lands offer a different but equally enticing environment. A spectacular climate year round, endless beaches, a tax-free port, and the areas and 58,000 campsites. Even in New York City, miles of concrete are frequently interrupted by parkland-37,000 acres in all. Am\u00ad ple shoreline is provided by the St. Lawrence River, Lakes Erie and Ontario, and the entire perimeter of Long Island. Inland, nearly 5,000 lakes dot the region which, along with numerous rivers, provide a breeding ground for hundreds of types of fish. The State also boasts the nation's most massive water\u00ad falls, led by the mighty Niagara, which empties 180,000 tons of water per minute. lure of casinos have earned the islands a reputation as one of the foremost fun spots in the western hemisphere. The physical makeup of the region has provided more than scenic beauty and recreation. It has been the most influential force in shaping the region's population patterns and its vast industry and commerce. Hillside cabanas and beachfront apartments in Puerto Rico-tropical paradise for many but just another audit site for us. GAO Review / Summer 1980 Alive and Well Eeonomieally Although its image may have become a bit tarnished in recent years as a result of the emigration of some large firms and New York City's financial problems, our re\u00ad gion is still the nation's economic center and the world's financial capital. Its economic profile is as diverse as its people and its geography-manufacturing, fi\u00ad nance, trade, agriculture, tourism, and services are all well repre\u00ad sented. As might be expected, the ports and waterways of New York were, and still remain, the major source of its economic vitality. The 578- mile waterfront surrounding New York Bay and the lower Hudson River forms one of the best natural harbors in the world. The harbor and the Hudson River (navigable fo~ 150 miles to Albany), make the city a natural gateway. From the Hud\u00ad son, access to Canada and the Atlantic Ocean is provided by river extensions, lakes, canals, and the St. Lawrence Seaway. Most impor\u00ad tantly, the linking of the Hudson with the Great Lakes by the Erie Canal provides an easy, inexpensive route to the heartland of the continent. As the heart pumps nourishment to the body, so does the port of New York rad iate its vital ity through\u00ad out the region. It is actually eight ports in one, from which 13,000 ships depart each year. The port, together with Kennedy Airport, handles more cargo and passenger traffic than any other U.S. point of entry. Fully one-third of the nation's foreign trade moves by air, truck, water, and rail through the port of New York. The region was slow to develop economically during the colonial period. For most of its early years, It was overshadowed by Boston to the north and Philadelphia to the south. By 1830, however, the region had attained a position of national leadership in commerce which it has never lost. Nurtured by the region's natural attributes, the in\u00ad dustrial revolution gave rise to an economic colossus unparalleled in history. The presence of this phe\u00ad nomenon is evidenced today by the region's front-runner role in virtually GAO Review/Summer 1980 The New York Region: The Apple Still Shines every sphere of economic activity. Nearly one-fourth of Fortune's 500 industrial giants, including such corporations as Exxon, Mobil, ITT, and RCA, are headquartered in the New York region, many of them concentrated in skyscrapers in a few square miles of Manhattan. The New York Stock Exchange was born under a buttonwood tree in the late 17th century, just a short distance from where it stands today. It has spawned a financial empire which includes two major stock exchanges accounting for more than 90 percent of all securities traded in the U.S.; several commodity exchanges whose daily activities \"affect com\u00ad modity trading worldwide; and in\u00ad numerable banking institutions, domestic and foreign, which handle more than $80 billion annually. Complementing these mighty in\u00ad stitutions are New York City's small businesses. There are 200,000 em\u00ad ployers in the city, but the average business, many of which are whole\u00ad sale and retail trade establish\u00ad ments, employs less than 25 peo\u00ad ple. Retail sales amount to $13 billion each year. In New York, \"I can get it for you wholesale\" is more than a cliche. It is a way of life accounting for $80 billion in sales annually. Many New Yorkers like to display impressive labels. Many more prefer a bargain. 13 The New York Region: The Apple Still Shines While the region has experienced somewhat of a decline in its manu\u00ad facturing position, it still accounts for about one-tenth of the nation's industrial output. New York City is the third largest manufacturing center in the country, its garment and publishing industries being of prime importance. The areas around Albany, Binghamton, Buffalo, Rochester, and Syracuse turn out a myriad of products which could be listed in a book the size of a small city's telephone directory. Products include everything from apparel to aluminum, pharmaceuticals to photographic equipment, and baby food to B-52 components. New Jersey has earned a reputation as the nation's workshop. Aside from its production of chemicals (first in the nation), its companies spend about 10 percent of the nation's research and development dollars. There is even a modest mining industry in the region owing to valuable deposits of iron ore, talc, zinc, and titanium in northern New York State. Services account for an ever\u00ad increasing portion of the region's economy. New York City, for exam\u00ad ple, is home to the three major tele\u00ad vision networks and most of the nation's large advertising firms. Amid this hubbub of industrial and commercial activity is a very significant agrarian economy. New York ranks second in the U.S. in dairy products and third in agricul\u00ad tural products with some 46,000 farms producing $2 billion worth of crops. Combined with New Jersey's 7,000 farms, our region is a leading producer of apples, cherries, poul\u00ad try, cheese, eggs, and tomatoes. New York's vast cultivation of wine grapes makes it the second largest wine producing State. It also pro\u00ad duces more maple syrup than any State except Vermont. Of course, a huge labor force is needed to support this economy. New York's non-farm employment is about 7.2 million, led by com\u00ad munity, social, and person~1 ser\u00ad vices (1.6 million), manufacturing (1.5 million), and wholesalel retail trade (1.5 million). Employment in New Jersey exceeds 3 million, bringing the total for the area to over 10 million people. As diverse as it is large, the labor force includes people employed in just 14 about every occupation imaginable, and they are relatively well paid. New York's per capita income of $8,267 ranks 14th among the States, while New Jersey ranks 7th with a per capita income of $8,818. The economic and commercial base of our region could not exist without a large, quick, and efficient transportation system. While it may not always be quick and effiCient, the region's system is certainly extensive. Aside from waterways, railroads, and a vast network of highways, turnpikes, and parkways, there are well over 600 airports, sea\u00ad plane bases, and heliports to move people and goods in, out, and through the region. One of the more interesting transportation happenings takes place every workday, when literally millions of residents from New York City and the outlying suburbs converge on Manhattan from all directions. By rail, bus, auto, ferry, and foot; over water, across bridge, and through tunnel; commuters mount their assault on the tiny island, shoving and snarling their way to their workplaces, interrup\u00ad ting their trek only momentarily for a few quick sips of coffee at a local luncheonette. At some point in their journey, most commuters use the city subway system. This en\u00ad gineering marvel, whose 760 miles of track rise and dip from 180 feet underground to 90 feet above\u00ad ground, crisscrosses the city and ties the core of the metropolis to the nooks and crannies of its outer boroughs by carrying 3.5 million people a day to work and back home. Just Folks-But Lots of Them What about the people who inhabit the region and helped build its economic strength? New York and New Jersey are two of the most populous States, but the great majority of the PElople live on a frac\u00ad tion of the land. About 90 percent of the population live in urban areas. New York City's population growth was heavily influenced by its position as a leading harbor. The port lured industry, trade, and related pusiness, and the newly\u00ad created jobs caused crowded areas to become even more crowded. Similarly, waterways spawned the larger upstate population centers\u00ad Albany, toward the top of the Hudson; Syracuse, Rochester, and a number of smaller cities along the Erie Canal; and Buffalo on Lake Erie. The New York City metropolitan area, extending over a radius of about 20 miles, accounts for 60 percent of the 25 million people living in the region. The Albany and Buffalo areas embrace two million more. Elsewhere in New York, the population density is smaller than that of Wyoming. The northern area of the State, for example, covers more than one-fifth of the State, but contains only two percent of the population. Where did New York's population come from? Many can trace their American heritage back as far as three centuries or more. These des\u00ad cendants of the hardy Dutch, English, Scottish, and French who first settled and civilized the region remain today, providing a link be\u00ad tween the region's wild and woolly past and the complexities of its modern day life. But in the last 150 years, the population profile of the region, especially New York City and the surrounding area, has been influenced mostly by immigration. Probably no single phenomenon characterizes New York more than that of immigration. From its beginnings, New York has played receptionist, host, and comforter to millions of foreign-born seeking to escape poverty, famine, and perse\u00ad cution. Wave after wave of re\u00ad fugees-different faces with similar stories-have entered the New World through the port of New York. Some left for other parts of the nation in search of the American dream and were quickly absorbed into the American melting pot, but many others sought it here. Often living in insular enclaves, com\u00ad fortable only among others who spoke in their tongue and under\u00ad stood their customs, immigrants and their descendants stamped New York with a unique character and vitality it still retains. Even today, three million New Yorkers speak English as a second lang\u00ad uage or do not speak it at all. The cycle continues. Where once the huddled masses were primarily European, latter-day newcomers GAO Review / Summer 1980 hail from all corners of the earth\u00ad South and Central America, eastern Europe, the Mideast, the Far East, the southern United States, and the Caribbean Islands-bringing with them the customs, hopes, and dreams that continue to revitalize and rejuvenate an otherwise aging city. A walk around town is the best evidence of the glorious potpourri: the garment center, where a strange dialect of English, heavily laced with Yiddish and Spanish phrases, is spoken; the EasfBronx, where all holidays rank a distant second to St. Patrick's Day; Brighton Beach, where policemen named Russo and Schmidt speak Russian to residents of \"Little Odessa\"; and a restaurant called La Nueva China which, some say, serves the best tacos east of Texas. Volumes have been written re\u00ad counting the contributions of these many groups to society. We would be remiss if we failed to mention one of the most obvious and pleasurable contributions of which New York has been the major bene\u00ad ficiary-the spectacular variety of cuisine which has made the city a veritable palace of international gourmet delights. Culture, Culture, and More Culture Highbrows, lowbrows, and every\u00ad one in between find plenty to suit their cultural and entertainment tastes in our region. Whether attending the first exhibit of an avant-garde painter at a Fifth Ave\u00ad nue salon, squirming in a cramped seat at an off-off-Broadway store\u00ad front theater, or munching hot dogs at Yankee Stadium, the spectrum of cultural and entertainment activity is unmatched. For the museum buff, the opportunities are endless. There are hundreds of museums throughout the region, including the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y. In New York City, there seems to be a museum for just about everything. Among the larger and better known are the Museum of Natural History, the largest of its kind in the world; the Brooklyn Museum, which boasts The New York Region: The Apple Still Shines ium, where you can take a trip through the solar system without ever leaving your seat. Just as fascinating are the American Mus~\u00ad um of Immigration, the New York Jazz Museum, the Museum of Broadcasting, the Doll and Toy Museum, Museo del Barrio, the Museum of the American Indian, and the Songwriters' Hall of Fame. Fine art museums have become a city trademark-the Metropolitan Museum (the largest art museum in the western hemisphere), the Muse\u00ad um of Modern Art, and the Guggen\u00ad heim, to name a few. Perhaps not as well known, but certainly a local favorite, is the Cloisters. Perched on a hilltop in northern Manhattan, the museum is a reproduction of a medieval monastery replete with Gregorian chant background music, offering truly fantastic exhibits of medieval art and artifacts. If viewing museum art is not your thing, or if you'd like to make a purchase, then visit some of the many indoor and outdoor art gal\u00ad leries which abound in the region. They cater to every conceivable taste, from the ultra-modern of Greenwich Village and Soho to the the largest Egyptology collection in New York's magnificent cathedrals are well\u00b7known, but humble storefront churches the U.S.; and the Hayden Planetar- provide solace too. GAO Review/Summer 1980 1& The New York Region: The Apple Still Shines traditional and extravagantly ex\u00ad pensive galleries of 57th Street, where $100,000 price tags are not uncommon. If you can't find what you're looking for here, it probably doesn't exist. For a less expensive alternative, merely walk around town and be treated to an endless variety of architecture ranging from early Dutch colonial, to the gran\u00ad deur of Grand Central Station, to the art deco of Rockefeller Center. A common sight in New York-the co-existence of several generations of buildings. Left, a modern office building; center, a stately early 20th century structure; right, a tenement, probably pre-1900. Our region has long been a haven for budding and accomplished writ\u00ad ers and poets. This, coupled with the presence of the nation's major publishing houses, has given New York the leadership role in the world of literature. Similarly, as evidenced by the daily frenzy of activity along Seventh Avenue, New York con\u00ad tinues to be the nation's fashion trendsetter. The performing arts, however, give the region its preeminent position in cultural affairs. New dance. The Broadway theater is world-renowned. At any given time there are 25 to 30 first-rate musi\u00ad cals, comedies, and dramas on display; these survivors have met with the approval of notoriously tough New York audiences and critics. But our region also offers countless off-Broadway, off-off\u00ad Broadway, and repertory theater productions, often as enjoyable as their Broadway counterparts and much less expensive. For the aesthete, there are num\u00ad erous opera, ballet, and dance companies. Whether classical or modern, serious dance and music such as that proferred by the New York City Ballet, the Dance Theatre of Harlem, and the New York Phil\u00ad harmonic continue to be mainstays of the area's cultural life. Produc\u00ad tions can be enjoyed throughout the region in such facilities as Albany's Empire State Plaza Con\u00ad vention Center, the Saratoga Per\u00ad forming Arts Center, and New York City's Lincoln Center, home of the Metropolitan Opera, rivaled in fame only by Milan's La Scala. It's Not All Rosy The region's size and diversity offer many advantages, but also help to create enormous and com\u00ad plex problems. As with much of the northeast, New York and New Jersey have experienced a sus\u00ad tained period of economic stagna\u00ad tion. This, coupled with inflation, has aggravated already existing problems such as unemployment, deteriorating housing, overcrowded mass transit systems, crime, and drug abuse. The situation is partic\u00ad ularly acute in the cities of the region. New York's South Bronx, for example, has become a national symbol of urban decay. We have come to realize that the advantages and positive aspects of life which make the region distinct go hand\u00ad in-hand with other distinctions on the dubious side. During the past 10 years, New York has shown the sharpest de\u00ad cline of any State in per capita income compared to the national average. New Jersey has not been far behind. Similarly, ~Je'f\" York's unemployment rate is well above the national average and the State ranks third in the nation in the number of low-income residents. The severity of these problems takes on more significance when viewed in the context of the day-to\u00ad day difficulties faced by the citizens and localities of the region. A sample of New York City's prob\u00ad lems gives an idea of the rough seas the region is traveling. About 60 percent of the city's housing is more than 40 years old. York is the undisputed national Tourist to New Yorker: \"How do I get to Carnegie Hall?\" Reply: \"Practice, practice, capital of theater, music, and practice.\" 16 GAO Review / Summer 1980 The New York Rel(ion: The Apple Still Shines There's no place like home. And home in New York can be a comfortable dwelling in Brooklyn or a crowded tenement in Manhattan. Half of the nation's heroin addicts are in the city. The city's social service bud\u00ad get is $2.7 billion, including almost $1.5 billion for in\u00ad come maintenance. Police receive more than six million emergency calls an\u00ad nually, or a call every 5 seconds. More than half of the child\u00ad ren in the city's public schools read below their grade level. GAO Review/Summer 1980 Government, particularly at the Federal level, has been playing an increasingly active role in attempt\u00ad ing to combat the region's prob\u00ad lems. In fiscal year 1979, for example, about $37 bill ion in Feder\u00ad al funds were distributed to New York while New Jersey received about $12.7 billion. New York ranked second in terms of total Federal distributions to the States and ranked either first or second in monies received in such areas as agriculture, commerce and housing credit, transportation, community development, health, income secur\u00ad ity, veterans' benefits, education, employment, and social services. Additionally, there are about 163,000 civilian Federal employees in New York. Needless to say, money and a large bureaucracy do not make problems go away. As we in GAO know so well, resources must be used intelligently and effectively if the huge Federal investment in social and economic programs is to make any significant contribution in alleviating national and regional ills. That's where we enter the picture. Our Past, Present, and Future There has been a GAO presence in New York for about 30 years. Al\u00ad though the main office has always been located in New York, over the years we have had satellite offices in Syracuse, Schenectady, and Long Island as the workload of the various eras dictated. More re\u00ad cently, the Albany sublocation was established in the State capital in response to the growing emphasis on reviewing grants to States. Today, the regional office is located in the Federal building in lower Manhattan. The building itself is the second largest Federal office building after the Pentagon. GAO's quarters are on the top (41 st) floor looking out over-literally and sym\u00ad bolically-the hub of the region and the Government activity therein. Like GAO in general, we in the New York region have witnessed dramatic changes in the nature of the work we do and the types of people we have doing it. And, like other regional offices, our workload has been influenced by the prob\u00ad lems, trends, and nuances of the region we oversee. As might be expected, over the past several years we have been heavily and continuously involved in work deal\u00ad ing with income security, health, law enforcement, energy, environ\u00ad mental problems, mass transit, and manpower and employment train\u00ad ing programs. While these have formed the staples of our workload, we have also played a prominent part in several of the largest assign\u00ad ments undertaken by GAO. For example, over a 3-year period we 17 The New York Region: The Apple Still Shines devoted considerable resources to monitoring the ability of New York City to repay the Federal loans which saved it from bankruptcy. We were also heavily involved in the now famous review of the Summer Program for Economically Disad\u00ad vantaged Youth, which was featured on \"60 Minutes.\" Although we played a supporting role in the tele\u00ad cast, we had the starring (lead region) role in managing the job. Currently, we are (and, for the past 2 years, have been) involved in one of the most challenging assign\u00ad ments GAO has ever undertaken\u00ad an assessment of the effect of statehood on Puerto Rico. Our contributions to GAO have not been limited to audit and review activities. Over the years the re\u00ad gional office has developed an ex\u00ad pertise in such support functions as recruiting, training, and career de\u00ad velopment. Our 3-year orientation and training program, for example, was the first of its kind in GAO, and provided numerous staff members with a solid foundation in audit concepts and practices. We were also the first regional office to develop a formal and comprehen\u00ad sive staff handbook, collecting and interpreting GAO's national policies for regionwide application. The people who make the re\u00ad gional office tick reflect the diver\u00ad sity of the region. On the average, we are 33 years old and have 8 years of GAO experience. But after age and experience, there are no aver\u00ad ages in the variety of backgrounds and interests represented in the office. We were born in 13 States and six foreign countries. About one-fourth of us have advanced degrees. While accountants are still in the majority, at least 15 other disciplines-from management to microbiology-are represented among our educational credentials. Aside from English, we are proficient in nine foreign\u00b7 lan\u00ad guages and can stumble along in several others. In line with the immigrant char\u00ad acter of the region we serve, most of our staff members claim not too distant descent from ancestors across the seas, from the South, and from the Caribbean. No less than 20 different ethnic back\u00ad grounds are represented among the people in the office. Each exhibits 18 pride in h is or her own heritage and a genuine interest in and respect for the heritages of others. Most importantly, we bring to our work an understanding of the problems faced by many of these groups as they interface with Government programs affecting them. After all, we are not too many generations removed from these problems our\u00ad selves. As our backgrounds differ, so do our personalities. We are, at one time or another, cantankerous, sweet, excitable, blase, vengeful, forgiving, argumentative, and ac-commodating. But always, we are committed to GAO's purpose and mindful of our responsibilities to the taxpayers. What of the future? In view of the trends the region has been exper\u00ad iencing, it appears that our con\u00ad centration on work dealing with social and economic programs will continue. And, as always, we will strive to improve our ability to effectively fulfill GAO's objectives. Let's let the NYRO management team tell us in what directions they believe we should be moving. GAO Review/Summer 1980 Chuck Forbes Regional Manager \"We will, in the future, be even more heavily committed to evalua\u00ad ting social service programs. I think we have made very positive contri\u00ad butions in the food and nutrition area, especially in food stamps and child care. These will continue to be addressed because of the concen\u00ad tration of recipients in the region. I also foresee an expanded effort in mass transportation, environmental programs, and weapons procure- lent.\" Val Tomicich Assistant Regional Manager \"Of recent vintage, we have become involved in programs which focus on the elderly population and their varied concerns. We expect to con\u00ad tinue to work on activities involving the aged because we do have one of the largest concentrations of elderly in the country and because of their problems are getting greater atten\u00ad tion, especially as they are fast becoming a demanding and vocal political power in America.\" GAO Review/Summer 1980 The New York Region: The Apple Still Shines Tom McQuillan Assistant Regional Manager \"NYRO's primary management ob\u00ad jective has been to perform all of its functions effectively, economically, and promptly. Our management staff is currently focusing on prob\u00ad lems that need to be solved in order to achieve results that will motivate the staff to continue contributing to GAO's mission in the most effective manner.\" Jim Carlan Assistant Regional Manager \"NYRO has been and will continue to be heavily involved in income se\u00ad curity work. I would also expect that with the administration's in\u00ad creased emphasis on military pre\u00ad paredness and GAO's interest in areas where we can help reduce the budget, NYRO will be increasingly involved in defense contract au\u00ad dits.\" George Anthony Assistant Regional Manager \"The New York regional office should develop its planning capa\u00ad bility to more effectively interface with GAO's program planning sys\u00ad tem. This is crucial if New York is to do the work that it ought to be doing, and absolutely imperative if we are to develop our auditors to their maximum potential.\" If you've gathered that we're enthusiastic about the region we live in and the work we do, you're right. And if reading this has generated some enthusiasm (or at least curiosity) on your part, then come and join the 20 million people who visit us every year, and depart with a good feeling. 19 _=Jg= 11&_ \"\"-_ NOW IN PUERTO RICO AI ter pleasing New York's palate foc 10 years, COUSIN HO'S brings Its delicIouS Cantonese, Hunan and Szpchuen specialties to people who dppf e elate fine Or lenta I cuisine.

GAO Review/Summer 1980 83 Eric P. Berezin Mr. Berezin is a pre-law student at the American University, and is participating in GAO's co-op program as a claims adjudi\u00ad cator in the Claims Group-Financial and General Management Studies Division. He has appeared on the Dean's List throughout his college career, is a member of the na\u00ad tional honor society Pi Alpha Alpha, and is a member of AU's soccer team. A History of the Claims Division Editor's Note: As the Claims Division prepared to merge with GAO's Financial and General Management Studies Division, Director Daniel Leary thought an article on its history would be appropriate. As co-op student Eric Berezin began to research the topic, it became clear that this had not been pulled together before, and he faced a real challenge. Although the division's files and the Library of Congress yielded much infor\u00ad mation, many GAO staff and former officials contributed to the wealth of information contained in this article. Special thanks go to former Deputy Comptroller General Robert F. Keller and Former As-sistant Comptroller General Frank Weitzel, who unselfishly searched their memories for in\u00ad put. There is created an establish\u00ad ment of the Government to be known as the General Account\u00ad ing Office which shall be inde\u00ad pendent of the executive de\u00ad partments and under the direc\u00ad tion of the Comptroller General of the United States. 1 One of the most important re\u00ad sponsibilities vested in the General Accounting Office (GAO) by the 1921 Budget and Accounting Act was that which pertains to settling claims for and against the U.S. Government. Although this responsibility has been with the GAO since its incep\u00ad tion in 1921, the work in this area has changed dramatically through the years. Some of these changes have reflected the history of the times, while others bear a more personal imprint of a particular Comptroller General. The nature of the claims work has shifted drastically in the last decade so that the focus is now on over\u00ad seeing the claims activities in agencies rather than directly hand\u00ad ling most claims at GAO. With this in mind, on March 9, 1980, Comp\u00ad troller General Staats made the Claims Division a major component of the Financial and General Man\u00ad agement Studies Division, which performs parallel oversight func\u00ad tions for agency accounting sys\u00ad tems. It is now particularly appropriate to try to capture the history of what was the General Accounting Of-fice's oldest division. To do this adequately requires a multifaceted approach which examines the divi\u00ad sion's structure and workload, the people who influenced its history, and the changing roles of the rest of the GAO. Given the scope of this task, it is perhaps best to begin with some background on the overall claims process. Pre-GAO Claims Settlement The earliest concept for estab\u00ad lishing a claims function in the Federal Government can be traced to September 2, 1789, when Presi\u00ad dent George Washington signed a bill forming the Treasury Depart\u00ad ment. The law established a Comp\u00ad troller of the Treasury who was responsible for supervising \"the ad\u00ad justment and preservation of public accounts,,,2 and hearing all appeals submitted by those who were dissatisfied with the decisions of the Treasury Department on their claims. On March 3, 1817, President James Madison signed into law an act which required that public accounts be promptly examined and settled. Much of the language found in section 305 of the 1921 Budget and Accounting Act can be traced to this date. The act estab\u00ad lished a second Comptroller, who was to divide with the first Comp\u00ad troller the responsibilities for over\u00ad seeing all Government activities. Yet it was the first Comptroller who was authorized to superintend \"the recovery of all debts ... , and to take all such measures as may be authorized by laws, to enforce prompt payment of all debts to the United States.,,3 Following the implementation of this act, there was a great deal of disagreement as to whether or not the President, or a department head, could alter the decisions of the Comptroller of the Treasury. The issue was settled in 1823 by the passage of a bill vesting such authority solely in the courts and the Congress. Referred to as the GAO Review/Summer 1980 \"power of finality,\" this concept was later incorporated\u00b7 into the Dockery Act and remains as one of the underlying principles in the General Accounting Office. The Dockery Act, passed in 1894, represents the last major act per\u00ad taining to the claims function pre\u00ad ceding the 1921 Budget and Ac\u00ad counting Act. 'The ramifications of the act evolved from the findings made by the Dockery-Cockrell Con\u00ad gressional Commission which in\u00ad vestigated the laws guiding and the efficiency of the executive depart\u00ad ments. A provision of particular interest is that which authorized the Comptroller of the Treasury to \"superintend the recovery of all debts finally certified to them to be due the United States.\"4 An addi\u00ad tional provision eliminated the large number of Comptrollers who had been appointed through earlier statutes and replaced them with one Comptroller, who was to direct the entire department. Under this Comptroll~r were six auditors in charge\u00b7 or auditing par\u00ad ticular department accounts and assuring compliance on an con\u00ad tracts to which the Government was a party. The Comptroller was given the power to provide decisions to the various departments when re\u00ad quested, and he retained the power of finality granted to him by the 1823 act. In essence, this act and those preceding it worked toward estab\u00ad lishing a centralized system for auditing and financing the Federal Government, and overseeing its activities. This trend towards cen\u00ad tralization culminated with the en\u00ad actment of the Budget and Ac\u00ad counting Act, effective June 10, 1921. This act provided for two primary functions: a budgeting system for the United States Government, and an independent audit of Govern\u00ad ment activities. Section 305 of the act amended section 236 of the Revised Statutes and provided that \"all claims and demands whatever by the Government of the United States or against it, and all ac\u00ad counts whatever in which the Gov\u00ad ernment of the United States is concerned, either as debtor or cred\u00ad itor, shall be settled and adjusted in the General Accounting Office.,,5 At first glance it would appear A History of the Claims Division that GAO has been vested with a responsibility of enormous mag\u00ad nitude. This is true, but from a claims perspective there are numer\u00ad ous laws and regulations which limit the cases submitted by the executive agencies to GAO. It is these laws and regulations which have proven so influential in altering the work handled by the Claims Division fOr over half a century. These changes have affected the division's population; they have given rise to a unique relationship between Claims and GAO's examin\u00ad ation of transportation transac\u00ad tions; they have both negatively and positively affected the atmosphere within and the attitude of those working in Claims. It is these changes in particular which will now be traced in conjunction with the changing roles and trends of the entire General Accounting Office. Early Division History The 1921 Budget and Accounting Act gave the Comptroller General all of the auditing-related duties and responsibilities formerly vested in the Comptroller of the Treasury The Claims Division and the Office of General Counsel were two of the most sought after places of GAO employment in the 1940's. GAO Review/Summer 1980 25 A History of the Claims Division and the six auditors. Among these transferred tasks was the authority to examine and settle claims for and against the U.S. Government. On July 1 , 1921 , President Warren G. Harding appointed John Ray\u00ad mond McCarl the first Comptroller General of the United States and Lurtin R. Ginn the first Assistant Comptroller. McCarl nurtured his new agency with parental care and protection, yet also directed it with a strong hand. According to some, \"McCarl ... is reputed to have been a strict disciplinarian.\"e For exam\u00ad ple, McCarl relied on a bell to signal his employees when to begin work, go to lunch, or when to leave for the day. He demanded that the proce\u00ad dures and functions of the agency conform at all times to the exact letter of the law. And he stressed that his staff be punctual and meticulous, and from this, efficien\u00ad cy and productivity would evolve. Mr. McCarl also required that every voucher be individually scrutinized, and that claims examiners con\u00ad stantly be cognizant of things which might reveal negligence or mishandling on the part of the administrative officer who for- warded the voucher to GAO. In the event of such an occurrence, the voucher would be returned to the agency with instructions that all uncertainties be clarified. Although later criticized as being too slow and inefficient to handle the grow\u00ad ing caseload, McCarl believed that these procedures were the best way for the agency to establish itself and for it to attain legitimacy and respect from the executive agencies and other Government offices. McCarl also felt that the agency's efficiency could be enhanced if it adhered to more standardized and consistent operational procedures. In conjunction with this, he estab\u00ad lished the divisions according to their responsibilities, regardless of the work's pOint of origin. This policy promoted the merger, in 1923, of the Navy and Army depart\u00ad ments into a Military Division, and the work from the numerous non\u00ad military departments into a Civil Division. The cases submitted to the Civil Division originated in the Justice, Commerce, Interior, Agri\u00ad culture, and Treasury Departments, the White House, the Congress, ~6 Supreme Court, Government Print\u00ad ing Office, Interstate Commerce Commission, and all other indepen\u00ad dent agencies. EventuallY,the Mili\u00ad tary Division would also incorporate the casework from the United States Veterans Bureau. In accordance with the everpres\u00ad ent desire for \"efficiency, econo\u00ad my and control,,7 within the Govern\u00ad ment, and in addition to McCarl's personal desire for standardization and consistency, the Civil and Military Divisions were merged on December 1, 1923 to form the Claims Division. Thus, Claims took charge of settling all claims except those from the Post Office Depart\u00ad ment and those settled by the Transportation Division. In his 1924 Annual Report, Mr. McCarl indi\u00ad cated that, \"There is a decided advantage in having a!! claims settled in one division immediately upon receipt of proper supporting evidence. ,,8 From 1923 until 1926, Claims functioned as a separate division under the direction of W.S. Dew\u00ad hirst, the first chief of the Claims Division. In 1926, McCarl's policy of standard ization and consistency collaborated with the desire for \"economy and efficiency\" once again, this time resulting in the merger of the Transportation Divi\u00ad sion with the Claims Division. This initial merger would remain intact for 22 years. The Beginning or Change The Depression era brought many changes to GAO. These were re\u00ad flected primarily in the number of people employed and the scope of work bei ng forwarded to the agen\u00ad cy. More people than usual were now hired to help combat the increased case load caused by the New Deal programs and the Emer\u00ad gency Relief Acts. Secondly, GAO, like most Federal agencies, hired excessively to help offset the large number of layoffs occurring in the private sector. Initially these work\u00ad ers, referred to as Emergency Order (EO) employees, were hired to work just for the duration of the Depres\u00ad sion, yet many remained with the agency after the Depression had ended. The First To InDuenee Claims Being the first Comptroller Gen\u00ad eral, Mr. McCarl naturally influ\u00ad enced the formation of the agency and its organization during the early years. But David Neumann is prob\u00ad ably the first to have had a true effect on the Claims Division. Mr. Neumann took over as chief of Claims following the retirement of W.S. Dewhirst in 1931, and served until his death in November 1945. Being a lawyer, Mr. Neumann tried to recruit as many lawyers to work in Claims Division as possible, and he attained relative success for a number of years. Neumann helped to give Claims, along with the Office of General Counsel, the reputation of being one of the most prestigious places of employment for law school graduates. To help perpetuate this, the division institu\u00ad ted a mandatory requirement that, to be eligible to work in the contract section, one had to have a law degree. As an added bonus, those in the contract section were awarded grade 9, whereas those in the civil anq military sections were either grades 7,8, or 9. The agency explained this discrepancy by con\u00ad tending that the military and civil claims work was easier and less demanding than the contract work. Towards the end of his tenure as chief, Neumann was having diffi\u00ad culty enticing young lawyers to work in the Claims Division. Rather, many of them opted for the Office of General Counselor entered into private practice. In a final attempt to maintain the \"elitist\" reputation, the division sent some of the employees working in the clerical section to law school to take some courses in contract law, with the promise that they would then be eligible to receive promotions to examiner positions. It is interesting to note how many GAO employees began their GAO careers in the Claims Division and then moved up to assume top positions. Two of the most notable examples are Robert F. Keller and Frank H. Weitzel. Both came to Claims at a very young age, worked up through the legal office, and concluded their illustrious careers by serving as Deputy Comptrollers General.9 In addition, there have GAO Review/Summer 1980 A view of the lawyers' room in GAO headquarters, 1939. been numerous attorneys in the Office of General Counsel who began their careers with GAO in the Claims Division. The 1940's-A Deeade of (;hange As is readily evident, the General Accounting Office is an agency which has undergone constant change and refinement. Even today, this is a distinct characteristic of GAO. Yet if one were to single out any particular period when change in the Claims Division proved to be most influential, it was during the 1940's, especially after the conclu\u00ad sion of World War II. Beginning in the early 1940's, the divergency in the types of work and the number of claims being submit\u00ad ted to GAO increased tremendous\u00ad ly. Naturally, the crux of the work was war-related and the Claims Division received much of it. Many of these increases initially stemmed from the fact that during World War I and immediately following its conclusion, the Government pro\u00ad vided increased compensation for Government employees. This fact GAO Review/Summer 1980 was known to both the employees and the administrators, and except for a few particular cases, everyone received their compensation. Yet many people felt as if they still deserved some remuneration and they continued to flood GAO with these kinds of cases. As a result, GAO recommended that the Con\u00ad gress pass legislation limiting the amount of time claimants could file on such issues with GAO. It was decided that people had 6 months from the effective date of the act (August 10, 1939) in which to file. Around January 1940, just weeks before the deadline for filing was reached, an article appeared in a Washington, D.C. newspaper tell\u00ad ing the people that claims with the Government pertaining to compen\u00ad sation should be filed with GAO immediately. Eventually, this article appeared around the country, re\u00ad sulting in an additional 16,000 cases submitted to GAO. As a result of this, and instances similar to it, the Congress passed the Barring Act in October 1940. This act established a 10-year period for submitting claims to GAO; anything submitted after the A History of the Claims Division 10-year period was forever barred from consideration. A major change for all of GAO occurred when Mr. McCarl retired in 1936. Fred Brown served as interim Comptroller General from 1939 to 1940, when Lindsay C. Warren re\u00ad placed him. While in office, Mr. Warren did a great deal to alter GAO's direction and to reassess and reformulate the goals and oper\u00ad ational procedures of the entire agency. As he stated in 1942, the war \"affected directly or indirectly practically every branch of the work performed by the General Account\u00ad ing Office.\"'o The role of women was affected by the war in that they assumed more prestigious and financially re\u00ad warding positions. The scope and direction of the work changed dramatically, as did the ways the work was done, and the number of GAO employees fluctuated tremen\u00ad dously during the mid-1940's. But probably the most important event was that the seed for onsite field auditing was planted. Regarding the employment as\u00ad pect, it is interesting to examine employment figures during this 27 A History of the Claims Division period. In 1936, there was a total of 4,440 GAO employees, 408 of whom were in the Claims Divi\u00ad sion.\" In 1946, this total more than tripled to reach the all-time high of 14,904,'2 and in 1947, U\u00b7.e number dipped to approximately 11,000. 13 According to the Assistant Comp\u00ad troller at this time, Frank Yates, the\u00b7 reduction in 1947 was made volun\u00ad tarily. In a 1947 radio interview, Mr. Yates explained that it had become an almost unwritten GAO policy to return a portion of their appropria\u00ad tions at the conclusion of each fiscal year. He mentioned that as the watchdogs and overseers of the Government, it was GAO's respon\u00ad sibility to set a good example by applying their funds only to neces\u00ad sities. In Mr. Warren's mind, 14,904 people were not a necessity. Impaet of Change on Claims The 1940's also affected the Claims Division internally and in its relationship with its transportation function. In November 1945, A. Banks Thomas took over as chief of claims following the death of Mr. Neumann. The chief of the division was assisted by the assistant chief and the adinin istrative officer. It was the assistant chief's responsi\u00ad bility to oversee the activities of the Civil and Military Subdivisions and the Indian Tribal section. The Civil Subdivision had a civil review section, which reviewed the decisions reached on all of the cases in the section; a contract section; a postal claims section; and a miscellaneous section, which handled those cases not otherwise assigned to any other section (i.e., those involving the relief acts or accounts of the United States Com\u00ad missioners). The Military Subdivision included a military review section, an Army section, which examined claims for the Army and Air Force, and a Navy section. The Indian Tribal section prepared detailed reports and of\u00ad fered recommendations pertaining to the legislation or actions avail\u00ad able to settle discrepancies be\u00ad tween the United States and bands, tribes, or groups of Indians. This section also compiled and main\u00ad tained accurate data on the fiscal :!8 transactions which transpired be\u00ad tween the parties. To help war veterans reassimilate into society, the Veterans' Adminis\u00ad tration began to provide them with low interest loans. This precipitated the need for a debt section, because many of the recipients would either apply this money to things not allowable by the Veter\u00ad ans' Administration or would fail to pay the money back on time. By 1951, the internal structure of the Claims Division was changing, and this debt section was just one illustration of the change. A debt section was established in St. Louis, Missouri, to examine all cases involving the claims levied against members of the Air Force and Army who received overpay\u00ad ments on their family allowances. Shortly thereafter, a debt section was formed in Cleveland, Ohio, to handle those cases originating in the Navy Department. By the end of 1951, the contract section and the miscellaneous section in the Civil Subdivision had merged, as did the Army and Navy sections in the Military Subdivision. In addition, various support units of each sub\u00ad division were either revised or abolished. It is difficult to pinpoint the exact reasons for these changes, but they may have materialized as a result of the statement Comptroller General Warren made in 1949, that \"all operations in the General Account\u00ad ing Office not essential to the effective exercise of its audit and control responsibi lities ... which are not specifically required by law will be eliminated as rapidly as possible.\"\" In light of this, it appears that Claims was destined to undergo more changes. The field office in St. Louis moved to Indian\u00ad apolis, where the Army Finance Center housed most of the military records. A debt section was estab\u00ad lished in GAO's Washington head\u00ad quarters, and was responsible for taking action on military and civil matters, contracts, and other re\u00ad lated issues not specifically as\u00ad signed to a field office. The Wash\u00ad ington office was also in charge of adjudicating bankruptcy cases and those involving deceased persons. Beginning in 1956, a large num\u00ad ber of field offices were either eliminated or relocated. As a result of GAO Order 2.4, effective October 30, 1956, the Claims Division was formally comprised of a Payment Branch and a Debt Branch. In addition, the titles chief and as\u00ad sistant chief were replaced by director and deputy director, re\u00ad spectively. The first man to assume the new title of director was Law\u00ad rence V. Denny, succeeding Mr. Thomas who retired in 1957. As part of the relocation trend, on February 28,1965, the Indian Tribal section was shifted to the General Services Administration, under the direct supervision of the National Archives and Records Service. This transfer was made because Comp\u00ad troller General Joseph Campbell felt that the Indian Tribal section performed a function which was more like that of an executive branch, and not a legislative one. On June 30,1967, the Indianapo\u00ad lis field office was closed and the Washington headquarters assumed the remainder of the work once per\u00ad formed there. The majority of employees from Indianapolis either came to Washington or took jobs with other Government agencies. From this pOint on, most of the changes in the Claims Division were geared towards the nature of the work the division would do, and what work it would return to the executive agencies. The Separation of Claims and Transportation One of the problems confronting the GAO in the rnid-1940's was a substantial decline in the number of skilled and experienced personnel. This was primarily attributed to the fact that most of the men who served in these specialized areas joined the military. The initial decline in this group of speciali;zed workers was probably the underly\u00ad ing cause for the excessive number of overpayments made on the trans\u00ad portation vouchers submitted dur\u00ad ing 1945-1947. Because of the overload in war-related transporta\u00ad tion cases, the people working in the transportation section were having difficulty maintaining the flow of work. As the situation worsened, Mr. Warren was forced to implement alternative voucher examining procedures, for he was GAO Review/Summer 1980 informed by his advisors that if these measures were not adopted, it wou Id take 10 to 12 years to complete the claims audit work. These alternative measures entailed a more superficial investigation of the transportation vouchers. Shortly after World War II ended, a memo was circulated throughout GAO saying there would be a reduc\u00ad tion in personnel. Infuriated by this, a group of people working in the transportation section went to Cap\u00ad itol Hill and explained that they had inadequately examined the vouch\u00ad ers for 2 years. This prompted a test reaudit of a segment of the pay\u00ad ments made on transportation vouchers. The survey revealed over\u00ad payments amounting to more than $100 million, almost exclusively on bills of lading audited from October 1,1945, through June 30, 1947.'5 Congressman Porter Hardy Jr.'s subcommittee of the Committee on Expenditures in the Executive De\u00ad partments (later renamed the Com\u00ad mittee on Government Operations) had conducted the survey, and their conclusions induced Mr. Warren to issue GAO Order 81 on April 30, 1948, separating the transportation section from the Claims Division effective May 2, 1948. Warren's main reason for ordering the separ\u00ad ation was to \"concentrate in one division the work of settling claims by or against the United States in\u00ad volving charges for common carrier transportation and auditing vouch\u00ad ers ... for the account of the United States.,,'6 This meant that the newly reestablished Transportation Division was to concentrate entirely on reauditing the vouchers from the war and to make setoffs, when pos\u00ad sible, to help compensate for the overpayments (a setoff occurs when a person is in debt to the United States Government and is then owed money on another, unrelated transaction. The amount owed to the individual by the Government will be withheld in an effort to balance out the individual's earlier debt). Mr. Warren Versus Mr. Mosley As indicated earlier, it was a Claims Division policy in the 1930's and early 1940's to require one to have a law degree to be eligible to GAO Review / Summ.er 1980 A History of the Claims Division Until 1951, GAO was located in the Pension Building. Here, examiners are following Mr. McCarl's orders that'vouchers be carefully and individually scrutinized. work in the contract section. In 1948, Glen Mosley was one of those employed in the division's contract section, and it was his contention that since lawyers were required to go through the extra years of schooling, they were entitled to earn more money and a higher grade classification. Prior to the GS pay schedule, the Civil Service Commission used three different job classifications. The \"CAF\" el)compassed all those doing clerical work, the \"CU\" for those doing custodial work, and \"P\" for those in the professional ranks. Initially, Mosley's request for a job reclassification was denied by the Civil Service Commission. But after months of arduous lobbying, the Commission finally ruled in Mosley's behalf, elevating him to a P-4, which was the equivalent to the present GS-11 grade. Examiners were promoted to GS-10 positions. Lindsay Warren, Comptroller General during this time, refused to comply with the Commission's decision, asserting that it was fab\u00ad ricated and invalid. Mosley argued that the Comptroller General had no legal authority to reverse the deci\u00ad sion and the case went to the District Court, on appeal. The court 29 A History of the Claims Division decided that the decisions were to remain, and handed down a man\u00ad damus reversing Mr. Warren's re\u00ad fusal to comply with the Civil Service Commission. Thus, as of July 20, 1948, all reviewers were promoted to a P-4. In October 1948, adjudicators filed for and were granted increases from GS-9 to GS-10, and in 1957, reviewers were promoted to GS-12 and examiners to GS-11. (The same law in July 1949 consolidated the P, CAF, and CU grades into the GS series presently employed by all Govern\u00ad ment agencies.) The outcome of Mosley's crusade for the job reclassification was naturally advantageous as it in\u00ad creased employees' financial posi\u00ad tions and their status. But a more important outcome resulting from the District Court's decision was the end of many years of despair and indifference those in the divi\u00ad sion felt towards their work, their agency, and themselves. These feelings grew from numerous lay\u00ad offs made after the war, and from the lack of promotions granted in the division for a number of years. Civilian employees were laid off after the war for several reasons. Mr. Warren ffrmly believed that with new procedures being implement\u00ad ed, or procedures which he planned to implement, there was no need for a large staff. Another reason for low morale was that war veterans were given job priority. Only after the veterans had been placed could nonveterans be hired. Lindsay C. Warren: The Innovator Lindsay C. Warren assumed the post of Comptroller General on November 1, 1940, succeeding in\u00ad terim Comptroller General Fred Brown. Until that time, GAO was primarily a centrally-structured agency which conducted most of its work in the Washington, D.C. headquarters. Although there were various field offices throughout the United States, they played a rela\u00ad tively small role. It became apparent to Warren that there was a need to transform the structure of the agency in view of its ever-expanding scope of work and the increased expenditures of the Federal Government. Warren 30 realized that the Washington office was no longer adequate to allow efficient disposition of all work, so he began to use field offices more extensively. As discussed earlier, these of\u00ad fices were originally established to handle the cases involving pay\u00ad ments to war veterans. Auditors went to approximately two hundred war plants to observe and record the operational procedures used to make the payments. In essence, this represented the early stages of GAO as \"watchdog,\" or overseer of Government and agency activities. This practice was deemed vital then, and continues to be so today. For the first time, the General Accounting Office had a clear indication of how the money was being spent, if the spending was necessary, and if the guidelines and statutes established to regulate the agency activities were being com\u00ad plied with. It was concluded very early in this transformation period that \"efficiency and economy\" could best be achieved through onsite auditing because it allowed for \"prompt resolution of question\u00ad able payments.\" 17 The General Accounting Office was beginning to be more con\u00ad cerned with the operations of the executive agencies and less with in\u00ad dividual financial transactions. Slowly at first, but more rapidly as the practice became more produc\u00ad tive, GAO decentralized work to field offices and assumed more of an overseer role than ever before. As early as 1942, Mr. Warren dem\u00ad onstrated his desire for changing the agency by ardently supporting Public Law 79-248, the Government Corporation Control Act. With the influx of Government corporations, it was generally believed by both the Congress and GAO that there should be laws to guide corporate activities. The need existed for a body to assure compliance with these laws. Effective December 6, 1945, the Government Corporation Act was implemented so that the Congress and the appropriate Fed\u00ad eral agencies could \"insure that the financial programs of Government Corporations are carried out in ac\u00ad cordance with the policies of the Congress ... and by sound efficient methods.,,18 In his never-ending search for ways to upgrade GAO's organiza\u00ad tion, Mr. Warren established the Westfall Committee on November 29, 1947, and appointed Ted West\u00ad fall, director of the Audit Division, to head it. Mr. Warren instructed the committee to investigate GAO's organ izational structure and pro\u00ad pose more efficient ways to arrange it in a headquarters-field office structure. Mr. Warren also made it clear to the committee that they should keep in mind his personal desire for staff reductions and en\u00ad hancement of the budgeting and financing practices of the agency. By the end of 1949, Mr. Warren had introduced the concept of com\u00ad prehensive audits to GAO. In its simplest terms, the comprehensive audit was one which attempted to review in appropriate detail all activities of an agency, including financial ones, to determine what improvements were necessary and which of the procedures were working effectively for the agency. TQ successfully perform these au\u00ad dits, it was imperative that onsite field auditors conduct them. These audits were done in response to requests made by the Congress and department heads, and encompas\u00ad sed broader areas than the earlier audits of the McCarl era. After the audit was completed, reports were issued to the PreSident, the Con\u00ad gress, and the particular agency stating exactly what was done, what was found, and the recom\u00ad mendations for improvement. An arrangement similar to the comprehensive audit was developed for the Claims Division. Auditors went to the executive agencies and, as part of their responsibilities, assisted the agencies in disposing of their claims. Auditors answered questions and showed agencies their alternatives in handling the case. It was hoped that those in the Claims Division would act in a liai\u00ad son role with the field auditors so that when the latter were con\u00ad fronted with a point of legality they could not resolve, the Claims personnel would instruct them. Naturally, there were still cases which were required to be sent to GAO because of a statutory require\u00ad ment or because there were ques\u00ad tions of doubt. Overall, this was an attempt to transform the Claims Division, like the rest of GAO, into GAO Review I Summer 1980 more of an oversight role. As new systems were implement\u00ad ed by Federal agencies, more peo\u00ad ple in the Claims Division were laid off. Unfortunately for the staff, their work was very different from the rest of the agency in that they dealt with pOints of legality rather than accounting-type work. Th is meant that many people in Claims were unprepared for accounting work, or they lacked desire to start a new career in a different field. Because of this, the morale and at\u00ad titude of the staff began to deterior\u00ad ate once again. Elmer B. Staats: The Present Era Shortly after Elmer B. Staats succeeded Joseph Campbell as Comptroller General, the Federal Claims Collection Act was passed. Effective on July 19, 1966, this is possibly the most important statute ever to affect the Claims Division. It was developed through the joint effort of the Attorney General and Comptroller General, and continued along the path originated by War\u00ad ren. The act allowed the executive agencies either to compromise a settlement or terminate their collec\u00ad tion efforts on claims not in excess of $20,000. Although there were ex\u00ad ceptions to this rule-cases in which there was evidence of fraud, a presentation of a false claim, or misrepresentation by any party who had a direct interest in the case-it was intended that the act would require the executive agencies to assume more responsibility for their claims. To enhance its \"overseer\" role, Claims Division was to monitor the collection efforts of the executive agencies. GAO believed that there were numerous occasions when agencies could prevent individuals or businesses from incurring debts to the Federal Government by im\u00ad proving administrative procedures and creating disincentives through more aggressive collection action by the agency. Proper training for agency staff also could prevent erroneous payments, payments which could become debts to the Federal Government. It was intend\u00ad ed that these methods would be a precise way in which GAO and the GAO Review/Summer 1980 Claims Division could provide the greatest service. The GAO could establish procedures for the agen\u00ad cies to follow, and by monitoring the agencies, Claims would be able to detect and eliminate those causes of debts. While standards implementing the act were being written, there was a decline in the amount of work coming into the Claims Division. Lawrence Denny, division director at that time, was told to investigate the matter and locate the problem. It was determined that agencies were misinterpreting collection in\u00ad structions. Collection efforts were being terminated without first es\u00ad tablishing the financial status of the debtor, and financial state\u00ad ments the agencies relied on did not accurately determine whether or not the debtor could, or would ever be able, to pay back the debt. After the agencies were corrected, the division was flooded with claims. Conversely, the department heads then misconstrued the Comptroller General's directive as being a way to rid themselves of all unwanted, difficult, uncollectable cases. Continuing the Spirit 011966 The Federal Claims Collection Act provided the impetus upon which a great many changes were made, with the intention that the scope of work handled in the Claims Division conform with its role as an overseer. Through the act, it was hoped that operational procedures would better conform between the payment and debt branches, and that policies would provide fair and just treatment to those who dealt with the division. Following the 1966 act, a number of GAO directives were issued to various executive agencies which required that when agencies en\u00ad countered a claim they deemed administratively uncollectable, the agencies were to forward it immed\u00ad iately to the Department of Justice, not to GAO. These directives were a way to reiterate to the executive agencies their responsibilities in collection, termination, or compro\u00ad mise of claims. Among the execu\u00ad tive agencies receiving directives were the Army, Navy and Veterans' Administration. A History of the Claims Division Other changes were made which intended to coordinate the opera\u00ad tional procedures of the debt and payment branches. In 1975, the Cong ress amended the 1940 Barri ng Act, reducing to 6 years the period in which claims against the United States can be brought. These changes reduced the scope of the work and added a sense of predict\u00ad abil ity and stabi lity to the proce\u00ad dures of the division. A further act helped to instill a sense of equity and fairness in the way claims by the Government for overpayments of pay were handled. Under certain limitations, Claims Division, acting under delegated authority from the Comptroller Gen\u00ad eral, was authorized to waive col\u00ad lection of the overpayment when it was deemed \"against equity and good conscience and not in the best interest of the United States.,,'9 These are but a few examples of the many changes brought about by Comptroller General Elmer B. Staats within the last 14 years. These changes have attempted to enhance further the oversight func\u00ad tion and \"watchdog\" role of GAO. Yet, with the changing functions of the Claims Division, there are still particular types of cases in which the division has retained authority. This authority not only includes routine cases, but also includes authorizing the President's salary each month, acting as a conserva\u00ad tor of the estates of U.S. citizens who die abroad, and settling certain disputes between agencies. In the early 1970's, the last two major intradivision structural changes occurred. In August 1970, the Agency Reviews and Assistance Branch was established to assist in the function of claims settlement and debt collection, intending to increase the efficiency of payment activities, eliminate excessive over\u00ad payments, and expedite the debt collection effort. This branch was also responsible for reviewing col\u00ad lection and payment activities of executive agencies and assuring compliance with all the applicable laws and statutes. In 1972, the Transportation Divi\u00ad sion and the Claims Division merged for the last time, forming the Transportation and Claims Divi\u00ad sion (TCD). Thomas Sullivan, who 31 A History of the Claims Division The advent of electronic technology has greatly enhanced all GAO operations.

However, it became clear that the transportation aspect of the division's work was con\u00ad cerned more with claims settle\u00ad ments than with the oversight of executive agency claims processes. Thus, on October 12, 1975, the transportation function was sepa- , Section 301, Title 111,1921 Budget and Ac\u00ad counting Act. 2 \"The General Accounting Office and Its Functions-A Brief Historical Outline,\" GAO Review, Summer 1971, p. 1.

Staats Adapted from a speech presented to the National Civil Service League at their 1979-1980 career service awards program, March 20, 1980. 34 Career Challenges in a Changing Civil Serviee It is safe to say that the Career Service Award bestowed by the National Civil Service League is the Nobel Prize of the Federal profes\u00ad sional community-a mark of dis\u00ad tinction that has been well-earned by the recipients in the daily performance of duties which are complex and demanding, reflecting a high degree of commitment to the principles of public service. Since it was founded almost a hundred years ago, the National Civil Service League has been at the forefront of espousing good gov\u00ad ernment in our nation_ From the beginning, the organization recog\u00ad nized that attracting industrious and capable people to the Federal Government-and holding them there-was at the core of an effi\u00ad cient and effective civi I service. They were correct in that assumption. The single most valuable compo\u00ad nent of a strong, aggressive civil service is an individual of integrity and purpose-an individual whose dedication to the national welfare is demonstrated through a thoughtful and creative approach to every undertaking. This program gives national rec\u00ad ognition to 10 Federal employees who have distinguished themselves in the course of their careers in public service. The criteria on which selection is based is rigid. Accord\u00ad ing to standards set by the National Civil Service League, nominees must have displayed exceptional efficiency, sustained superior per\u00ad formance and accomplishments in carrying out their assignments. Such a mandate- in the intricate maze of the present Federal estab\u00ad lishment-requires uncommon mo\u00ad tivation to achieve. GAO Review / Summer 1980 I believe it is appropriate to con\u00ad sider the current climate of the civil service environment and the de\u00ad mands placed on public administra\u00ad tors today in the context of the changes that are swirling around us. The Carter administration's broad civil service reforms, set in motion with the passage by the Congress of the Civil Service Re\u00ad form Act of 1978, have thus far focused on the top levels of Govern\u00ad ment. Over the past two years, w'e have witnessed the creation of the Senior Executive Service and the as yet untested Merit Pay System, which will go into effect no later than October 1980. Overall, these reforms are based on sound princi\u00ad ples intended to maximize the productivity of Federal workers at all levels of Government. When the Merit Pay System is implemented, employee performance, rather than longevity, will be the determining factor in salary increases-a long\u00ad standing mainstay of the corporate world. Only time will serve as an accurate measure of the merit and effectiveness of these recent changes. But the introduction of the competitive element into the civil service system will have a far\u00ad reaching effect on the way in which the Government conducts its busi\u00ad ness in the immediate years ahead. Most certainly, these will be chal\u00ad lenging times for innovators and futurists who look to public admin\u00ad istration as the area where they wish to effect change and make their presence felt. What will these changes mean for the professionals who elect Govern\u00ad ment service as the discipline in which they will pursue their ca\u00ad reers? Basically, this altered environ\u00ad ment calls for the cultivation of a new attitude of mind which puts a higher and consistent value on what might be termed \"anticipation.\" To do this, we must create within ourselves the desire to find time in our schedule to think and to plan. Tomorrow's executive must not only handle administrative duties capably, but also see to it that policy machinery stays several lengths ahead of next year's prob\u00ad lems. The Government manager of the future must have the qualities of GAO Review / Summer 1980 Career Challenges in a Changing Civil Service restlessness, of research, of dis\u00ad satisfaction. This is where adminis\u00ad tration both supplies and finds its drive, and where it makes its contri\u00ad bution to the entire process of per\u00ad fecting the imperfect structure of compromises that we call modern society. The issue is really the rate at which this incremental process will go on, or how strong the vein of creativity in management will be. If managers lack creativity them\u00ad selves, they still have the opportu\u00ad nity-and the obligation-to spread the contagion of leadership through the organization so that the envi\u00ad ronment encourages creativity among those who have potential. This means less emphasis on pro\u00ad cedure manuals, on dogmas of system and method, on fetishes for hair-splitting in rubrics of bud\u00ad geting, personnel management, and methodology, without losing the contributions of these essential disciplines. To be truly creative, we must reach beyond the things about which we already feel certain. We must take risks. We must unleash our notions, our curiosity and our instincts to experiment. We must find out what the other fellow is thinking about and why he's think\u00ad ing about it. We must rediscover that there is a convergence some\u00ad where along the line between and among every thread of public pOlicy-between science and for\u00ad eign relations, between housing and health, between transportation and defense, between budgeting and economics. To function effectively, public administrators must grasp the big picture. A fragmented approach will not suffice for the manager who must carry out more and more public policy through contracts, grants, regional compacts, insti\u00ad tutes, foundations, and self\u00ad contained business-type enter\u00ad prises which will make manage\u00ad ment both possible and difficult. The line between public administra\u00ad tion and private participation will be less clear than ever, while the hybrid will flourish. And it is here that managers will have their work cut out for them-in maintaining the essential responsibility that belongs with Government, in under\u00ad standing the fine difference be-tween supervision and interference, and in judging how well the ends of public policy are being served. I doubt seriously that Govern\u00ad ment executives of the future can be developed and trained exclusive\u00ad ly in the career civil service. They will have to have some firsthand experience with related disciplines: the university environment, the regional environment, the business and research environment. Efforts must be expanded to develop an exchange of persons between Gov\u00ad ernment and these allied commun\u00ad ities, through reciprocal internships and residencies. This trend is already underway and I expect it will expand further as new needs emerge which support the value of such interchanges. Still another determinant with which we must cope in the coming years is the growing appetite for data-the paSSion for facts, for information, for probability. This is inevitable as a society draws closer together, as public purposes fuse, as the public and private economies meld, as decision making takes place in a continuum. The information explosion, which has characterized the last half of this century, has occurred with such force and vitality that we, as a society, are still struggling to understand it and sort out its meaning. Computer technology has changed how we do virtually every\u00ad thing we do. The rapidly prolifera\u00ad ting uses of electronic storage, retrieval, and processing of infor\u00ad mation can swamp us with material almost instantaneously. In the past, this material would have taken weeks, months-even years-to acquire. The big computers are being joined together in nationwide and even worldwide networks. Sat\u00ad ellites are not the wave of the future: they are here today. The electronic household is just a short distance down the road. The managers of the future must have a keen comprehension of the values and limitations inherent in the use of data, the art of timing in its collection, the process of de\u00ad signing the structure of investiga\u00ad tion, the ethics of reporting and dis\u00ad closure, and the judgment that interprets the significance of the information and applies it to policy- 35 Career Challenges in a Changing Civil Service making. And this is because man\u00ad agers will have to rely more upon the tops of their heads rather than the seats of their pants. They will have to be at home with theoretical statistics and the rarer altitudes of mathematical science. And, above all, they will have to search out the answers to a provocative question posed by T.S. Eliot many years ago: \"Where is the knowledge lost in information?\" Managers of the future must grasp the meaning of science and technology in the relations between Government and all the rest of society. World wars may have pro\u00ad duced the environment which gave science and technology the spark they were waiting for; science and politics, national and international, now go together and neither can function without the other. That is the central fact of our time, and it can only have one meaning for the future. The problems of administration are surely destined to require this kind of understanding of science and technology. How else shall we make a contribution in the difficult fields of weapons control and dis\u00ad armament, in problems of eliminat\u00ad ing air and water pollution, in har\u00ad nessing our energy sources for both human and industrial needs, in understanding the requirements of education and vocational motiva\u00ad tion, in meeting the requirements of an exploding population at home and abroad, and in providing devel\u00ad oping nations of the world with our expertise in technology, if our material resources will not be suf\u00ad ficient to share with them? No problem is more directly related to the future of our demo\u00ad cratic society than the problem of attracting the best talent for public service. While a democratic socie\u00ad ty's government is not expected to have a monopoly on the most able people produced by the SOCiety, neither can it afford to provide for the public service an iota less than its full share of the talent available. In the past, the consequences of an average or below par public service have not been nearly as serious as they are today. As the role of Government grows and changes, and as the decisions of public officials at all levels of Gov\u00ad ernment have a more and more 36 direct effect both on our daily affairs and on our prospects for the future, the quality of our public service has increasingly become a major public concern. In terms of what is needed, I cannot improve on the views of Clarence B. Randall. Out of his experience in Govern\u00ad ment and industry he stated the re\u00ad quirements clearly: The administration of our government calls for excellence in leadership. We need thor\u00ad oughly competent executives, acquainted with the most mod\u00ad ern techniques in managing large enterprises, from cost accounting to good human relations, from sound staff work to automatic data proces\u00ad sing. We need scientists in our race for pre-eminence in all fields of research. Above all we need a continuing source of replenishment of this talent. Government in the coming years will need as many people as pos\u00ad sible with the kind of vision re\u00ad quired to solve the complicated problems that arise in our mass society-arresting the rising costs of education, public health, and welfare; rebuilding cities; reducing proverty to its lowest level; and developing a higher sense of unity in our society. All Government employees have an opportunity to serve the nation. If I have a single thought to leave with the winners of the 1980 National Civil Service League Awards it will be this: At the end of the day, the end of the week, the end of the year, or perhaps at the end of a career, you should be able to look back and say: I am proud to have been a public servant, to have dealt with the problems of our time and to have had a part, however small, in contributing to their solution. This is the challenge of public service. In one way or another it has always been so and I expect it always will be. Public service is more than an occupational cate\u00ad gory; it is the discovery, as Harold Laski put it long ago, that men serve themselves only as they serve others. In 1835-a half century before the creation of the Federal career service-Alexis de Tocqueville des\u00ad cribed a public official in the United States as a person \"uniformly simple in manner, accessible to all the world, attentive to all requests and obligating in replies.\" I can offer you no better challenge than to adopt this description as your own in the productive years that lie ahead for each one of you.

GAO Review/Summer 1980 \"Allee Through The Looking Glass,\" Or Trying New Evaluation Teehniques Prologue Like \"Alice in Wonderland,\" I stepped through the looking glass and into a world of boundless imag ination and exciting adven\u00ad tures. I was surrounded by dazzling presentations of mathematics, vis\u00ad ually exciting abstractions of oper\u00ad ations research, and the warm cloak of philosophy. As I dreamed and searched, the abstract became concrete-the well-being of people could be measured and changes in their well-being could be observed over time. Together, GAO and I walked into the future-and we were at home. The words of the world beyond the looking glass are strange but inviting: N-dimensional space Vectors Probabilistic modeling Markoff change process These are esoteric words with hid\u00ad den power. If we can understand the concepts behind these, thereby tapping this power, what could we accomplish? We could measure the well-being of people, observe change in well-being over time, quantify the effect of ser\u00ad vices on well-being, and estimate the changes in well-being 20 years into the future. That is what GAO did in its study of the well-being of older people in Cleveland, Ohio. According to a recent survey, GA 0 Review readers want to know more about evaluation techniques and the results they produce. USing the results of this unique GAO study, let me share with you in plain, down-to-earth words the powerful outcomes of sophisticated 37 \"Alice Through The Looking Glass,\" or Trying New Evaluation Techniques evaluation techniques. Baekground The study was immense and highly complex. Staff from the Human Resources, Field Opera\u00ad tions, and Financial and General Management Studies Divisions joined with consultants in gerontol\u00ad ogy, mathematics, and operations research to make this study suc\u00ad cessful. The Cleveland Foundation and over 100 Cleveland agencies also provided assistance. Older people shared their lives with us. We took a sample from over 80,000 people in Cleveland who were 65 years old and older and were not in institutions, such as nursing homes. From June through November 1975,1,609 older people were interviewed by Case Western Reserve University personnel. A year later, 1,311 of these people were reinterviewed. The remaining 298 people were institutionalized, died, or moved from Cleveland during the year. The state of the art of evaluation techniques in sociology, gerontol\u00ad ogy, and medicine were used. In interviewing, we used a question\u00ad naire containing 101 questions de\u00ad veloped by a multidisciplinary team headed by Dr. George Maddox and Dr. Eric Pfeiffer at the Duke University Center for the Study of Aging and Human Development. The questionnaire contained ques\u00ad tions about an older person's well\u00ad being status in five areas of func\u00ad tioning-social, economic, mental, physical, and activities of daily living. Services to older people were defined, measured, and quantified. To identify factors that could affect the well-being of older people, we 38 developed specific defin i\u00ad tions of services being pro\u00ad vided to older people and dimensions for quantifying the services; identified the providers of the services-families and friends, health care provi\u00ad ders, and over 1 00 social ser\u00ad vice agencies; obtained information about the services provided to each person in our sample and the source and intenSity of these services; and developed an average unit cost for each of the 28 ser\u00ad vices. About 1,000 variables of informa\u00ad tion on each of 1,609 people were collected over 2 years. USing these variables, we measured change in the well-being of people, estimated the effects of expanded help on these people, and demonstrated the effects of this expanded help on their well-being 20 years into the fu\u00ad ture. Personal Conditions of People: Changeable and Measurable Visualize a person passing through time-the aging process. This person is composed of many dimensions (or vectors) that change and are measurable. In our analysis, we captured four of these dimen\u00ad sions-health, security, loneliness, and outlook on life. These were combined into one composite well\u00ad being status called personal condi\u00ad tion. Personal conditions of people are measurable. In 1975, we measured personal conditions-health, secu\u00ad rity, loneliness, and outlook on life-of older people in Cleveland. About a third of the sample were in the best overall condition. On the other hand, more than a fifth were in the worst condition, as shown in Table 1. Personal conditions of people do change. In 1976, we reinterviewed our original sample and again measured their personal condi\u00ad tions. The overall personal condi\u00ad tion improved for 18 percent and decl ined for 18 percent. The outlook on life condition and the security condition changed the most (21 percent improved); the loneliness and health conditions changed the least (16 and 13 percent improved, respectively). Table 2 shows the changes that occurred during the year. As a result of these changes, in 1976, 32 percent of the people were in the best overall personal condi\u00ad tion as shown in Table 3. To measure change in the per\u00ad sonal conditions of people is im\u00ad portant in determining the effect of existing and proposed services on older people. The probabilistic model can be used to show effect.

Basically, we compared those who were receiving all the help they needed in our second year with those who were not. We then divided these two groups into two other groups; those people who (1) received all the help needed in 1975, and (2) did not receive all the help needed in 1975. Thus, we had four comparison groups as shown in Table 4. Conditions: The Probabilistie Model at Work Once we were able to measure change in personal conditions, an important question arose: \"If help is expanded, how many people would benefit?\" To answer this question, we used a probabilistic model. To estimate the effects of ex\u00ad panded help, we compared how dif-We then examined how the prob\u00ad lem situations of group A changed compared to how those of group B changed. Similarly, we compared how groups C and D changed. Table 4 Status of Help Received Between 1975 and 1976 1976 1975 Receiving all needed help Not receiving all needed help Improved No change Worsened Total Receiving all needed help GROUP A GROUP C Table 5 Percent Change in Illness Situation Over 1 Year A 28.0 26.3 45.7 100.0 B Group C (percent) 1.1 73.5 21.2 22.7 77.7 3.8 100.0 100.0 GAO Review / Summer 1980 Not receiving all needed help GROUP B GROUP D D 8.9 72.4 18.7 100.0 To illustrate, at the health level, 175 people were in comparison group A (all their illnesses were being treated in both 1975 and 1976),179 pegple were in group B, 132 people were in group C, and 123 were in group D. When comparing how the illness situation of these groups changed over the year, we found that those who were receiving all the medical help needed in the second year (groups A and C) fared much better over the year than those who were not (groups Band D). Table 5 shows those compari\u00ad sons. It shows that only 45.7 percent of group A worsened over the year, com pared to 77.7 percent of group B. Similarly, only 3.8 percent of group C worsened, compared to 18.7 percent of group D. Then, to determine the number of people who would be affected by expanding help to all older people in our sample, we applied the change rates for those who received all the help they needed in the second year to those who did not. We applied the change rates for group A to group B and the rates for group C to group D. On this basis, we estimated that 120 of the people (9.2 percent of the total sample) who would receive expanded help would have been in a better situation if they had been treated for all their illnesses. Table 6 shows our estimates for expanded medical treatment. Finally, we applied the same analytical techniques to the remain\u00ad ing security, loneliness, and out\u00ad look on life conditions and prob\u00ad lems as we had defined them. Assuming that older people in the United States are similar to those in Cleveland, we then estimated the number of people nationwide who would have been in a better situation in 1976 if the help needed had been expanded to all in need. A sizable portion of the older people would benefit from ex\u00ad panded help. For example, the greatest benefit would be realized in their illness situation-1.9 mil\u00ad lion people nationwide would have been in a better situation in 1976 if they had been treated for all their illnesses which interfered a great deal with their activities. The sec\u00ad ond greatest benefit would be realized in dealing with the security 39 \"Alice Through The Looking Glass,\" or Trying New Evaluation Techniques Category Best Marginal Worst Table 6 Estimate of People in Better Illness Situation Number of people in sample 1976 Estimate of people 1976 status status in a better without with illness situation change change Differ- Number of Percent of in help in help ences people sample 817 906 +89 120 9.2 256 287 +31 238 118 -120 1,311 1,311 problems, with 5.6 percent of the sample (1 .2 million people nation\u00ad wide) being in a better situation.

To demonstrate the effects of help over 20 years, we projected the conditions and problems of the 65 to 69 year old age group for the next 20 years. The Markoff change process applied the same rate of change that was observed in the first year (between 1975 and 1976) for the 65 to 69 age group over the next 19 years, thus arriving at a 20- year estimate. This process was applied twice-first using the ob\u00ad served rates of change between 1975 and 1976 and then using the rates of change based on our estimates of the effects of expan\u00ad ded help. Our projections show 11 percent more of the 65 to 69 age group would be experiencing an improved illness situation in 1980 than if they had not received expanded help. Fourteen percent more would be experiencing a better situation in 1985, 14 percent more in 1990, and 12 percent more in 1995, as shown in Table 8. Expanded Help Reduees ~ost 01 Medieal and Compensatory Help Having projected the effects of expanded help, we took the next natural step of projecting the costs of medical care and compensatory hel p over the next 20 years. Compensatory help is that provided to people who have problems in performing activities of daily living, such as preparing meals, bathing, walking, shopping, and eating. Our projections for the 65 to 69 age group over the next 20 years showed that if medical treatment were expanded to all in need, total medical costs over the 20 years would decrease slightly. Also, the cost of compensatory help would be reduced Significantly because of the effects of expanded medical treatment. Table 9 shows our national pro\u00ad jections of the decrease in the average annual medical and com\u00ad pensatory costs that could be achieved from expanded medical treatment-for those in the 65 to 69 age group in 1975-over the next 20 GAO Review/Summer 1980 years. It shows a total reduction of about $1.4 billion-$1.2 billion in compensatory help and $0.2 billion in medical treatment-due to pre\u00ad ventive medical treatment earlier in life. Aeeomplishments: Evaluation Teehniques at Work The results of the Cleveland study far exceeded our imagination. Consider: Eight reports were issued and three hearings were held on the study. Legislation based on this study is pend\u00ad ing before the Congress to provide additional health care and home services for older people. The Federal Council on Ag\u00ad ing, using data from our study, has proposed to the Congress and the President policy changes concerning provision of services to the frail elderly (people 75 years old and older). We recommended to the Congress that a national in\u00ad formation system be devel\u00ad oped based on our model. HEW estimates that a na\u00ad tional information system would save $100 million annually in better planning and allocation of resources. Our methodology is being used by other health plan\u00ad ning and social services or\u00ad ganizations in the United States. The Cleveland study is also being published in England as a case study in public policy. Using the results of our study, a Long Term Care Center and a Center for Gerontology have been es\u00ad tablished in the Cleveland area. We stepped into the future, dealt with the unknown, and met with success. Because the study advanced the state of the art of evaluation, we were asked by the Administration on Aging and Ger\u00ad ontological Society to place our data base and methodology in the archives for use by planners, re\u00ad searchers, and academicians.

Subalusky Mr. Subalusky, who has been with GAO since 1958, is a group director in the Com\u00ad munity and Economic Development Divi\u00ad sion. He has a B.S. degree in accounting from Penn State and is a CPA. He is a member of the National Capital Association of Accountants, and was president of the Washington chapter in 1977-1978. Current\u00ad ly, he is in charge of GAO's work at the Na\u00ad tional Oceanic and Atmospheric 42 Redewingan Standard: A Unique Serdee to the Congress GAO's review of the Department of Transportation's automobile safety standard, 1 calling for the installation of passive restrai nts 2 (air bags) in all U.S. cars by 1984, presents a unique example of how GAO fulfilled its traditional role of aiding and assisting the Congress. GAO did this review even though the Congress had already con\u00ad sidered and approved the standard. Why The Review? In 1974, the Congress passed a law stating that it would have a 60-day review period to disapprove, by means of current resolution, any safety standard that required an automobile occupant restraint sys\u00ad tem other than safety belts. In June 1977 the Secretary of Transporta\u00ad tion introduced a standard calling for passive restraints. The appropri\u00ad ate congressional committees held hearings during the designated review period and, in effect, \"had spoken\" by not overturning or sub\u00ad stantially modifying the standard. Many people, including certain congressional groups, considered the issue closed. However, GAO felt that questions on the issues of effectiveness, cost, and safety had not been answered, or, if answered, were not supported by what has been com\u00ad monly referred to as \"real world\" data. Also, those evaluating it expressed sharp differences of opinion over effectiveness of the proposed passive restraint system. Such evaluations often were looking at basically the same information and drawing completely different conclusions. The cost, the controversy, the unanswered questions on key is\u00ad sues provided a basis for GAO to initiate independently an in-depth review. The full benefit and ultimate effect of the GAO review is not known; however, a number of later actions and reactions by congres\u00ad sional and other interested parties demonstrate that not only did GAO have a sufficient basis for initiating this review, but it had an obligation to perform this study. The many sides of this controversy are pre\u00ad sented below. Automobile Safety About 50,000 people are killed each year as a result of highway accidents. Of these deaths, about 50 percent involve front seat pas\u00ad sengers. It was partially in response to this situation that Secretary of Transportation Brock Adams ruled on June 30, 1977, that automobiles will be equipped with passive re\u00ad straints beginning with large cars in 1982, medium-sized and compact cars in 1983, and sub-compact cars in 1984. Under the Federal mandate, by 1984 every new car manufactured or sold in the United States will have to be equipped with passive restraints-either automatic safety belts or inflatable air cushions re\u00ad ferred to as air bags. Those in favor of air bags contend that they will save 9,000 lives a year, will prevent 65,000 injuries, and will cost only about $200, most of which will be offset by insurance premium discounts. Air bag \"foes,\" on the other hand, assert that no objective evidence exists to support the claim that 9,000 lives will be saved each year, citing such estimates as \"sheer speculation.\" Opponents also point out that air bags are a potential safety hazard. They say the cost of air bags to the American public will exceed the total cost for all safety features since the Highway Safety GAO Review/Summer 1980 Act was passed in 1966. Air Bags Are Not a New Idea The idea of automatic passive re\u00ad straints is not new. Over the years several interesting ideas have bee~ proposed to help prevent injuries during accidents-including a false roof filled with tennis balls that would cascade into the passengers' compartment in the event of an accident. The first inflatable \"crash cush\u00ad ion,\" developed in 1952, was man\u00ad ually triggered. By the late 1950's Ford and General Motors wer~ heavily engaged in development and research on air bags and were dealing with such problems as acci- GAO Review / Summer 1980 Reviewing an Automobile Safety Standard: A Unique Service to the Congress dental inflation and conditions in which people were wearing glasses or smoking when the air bags went off. Today's air bag consists of three parts: a sensor located in the front part of the car; the bags or cushions themselves (one folded in the steering wheel hub and the other located behind the dash panel in the area of the glove compartment); and a knee restraint to prevent passengers from sliding under the bag before or during inflation. Air bags are designed to inflate within a few hundredths of a second after the start of a serious crash (an impact of about 12 miles or more per hour). The bag operates via an electrical impulse from one or more of the sensors, which ignites the stored chemical (sodium azide). The chemical, burning at a controlled rate, converts to nitrogen gas and inflates the bags. This happens in about 0.04 seconds about the time it takes a person t~ start moving off the back of the seat. Air bags are made of porous material which allows deflation to occur before they are fully inflated. The entire operation takes about 15 to 20 seconds. Although little actual data exists to support fully or convincingly refute many of the claims and counterclaims of how much protec\u00ad tion air bags provide, some re\u00ad searchers claim that accidents are survivable with air bags in pure frontal crashes up to 45 mph in large cars and up to 40 mph in small cars. 43 Reviewing an Automobile Safety Standard: A Unique Service to the Congress But Why Passive Restraints? Both proponents and opponents of air bags generally agree that safety belts (seat belts and shoulder harnesses) outperform air bags in virtually all types of accidents. In side or rear-end collisions, air bags are significantly less effective than seat belts. Why then mandate a complex and expensive restraint system of ques\u00ad tionable effectiveness? In the words of those advocating air bags, the American motoring public Simply refuses to \"buckle up.\" Studies made in 1977 and 1978 indicate that only about 14 percent of the drivers use their safety belts. This, air bag proponents contend, is the case even after major advertising pro\u00ad grams are initiated to increase safety belt use, and they add that fewer than 1 person in 10 involved in a serious crash was using a safety belt. This reinforces their conclusion that a substantial num\u00ad ber of motorists will not have ade\u00ad quate crash protection unless it is provided automatically. Why not just mandate safety belt use? As of June 1978, 21 foreign jurisdLctions had implemented safety belt use laws. However, mandatory safety belt laws don't seem to be the solution either. For example, after belt laws were passed in Ontario, Canada, usage increased to about 70 percent but rapidly dropped to 50 percent when enforcement was relaxed. Since 44 DIAGNOSTIC LAP BEL TS 1972, surveys have shown that Australian drivers' usage rates have ranged from a low of 65 percent to a high of 94 percent. By contrast, in Japan there is less than 1 percent belt usage; however, the law in Japan applies only to freeways and is not enforced. Enforcement of the law through some kind of sanction appears to be needed to maintain a high level of safety belt use. The Federal Government has not made a serious attempt to pass a mandatory belt-use law. Several States have attempted to pass legislation requiring belt use, but none have succeeded. Events That Led To The Passive Restraint Mandate The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration recognized that safety belts helped to keep passengers in place during acci\u00ad dents. Therefore, in 1968 it issued Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Stan\u00ad dard No. 20B-Occupant Crash Pro\u00ad tection. This standard required all new vehicles to have lap and shoulder belts at the front window seats and lap belts at all other seats. However, because of limited safety belt use and the strong bel ief that mandatory safety belt usage laws are unlikely, the Safety Admin\u00ad istration felt that passive restraints might be necessary to provide effective crash protection to vehicle occupants. Since the late 1960's, it has spent about $9 million on passive restrai nt testi ng. In 1971, the Safety Administra\u00ad tion amended the occupant crash protection standard to require pas\u00ad sive restraints in all cars, beginning August 15, 1973. The Chrysler Cor\u00ad poration contested the standard. In 1972, a Federal court upheld the Safety Administration's authority to issue a passive restraint standard, but held that the standard should be withdrawn and could not be rein\u00ad stated until the agency had devel\u00ad oped a test dummy to measure the performance of passive restraint systems. In the interim, car manufacturers had the option to build vehicles with passive restraint systems in\u00ad stead of safety belts. General Motors sold about 10,000 air bag\u00ad equipped full-size Buicks, Oldsmo\u00ad biles, and Cadillacs. Volkswagen sold about 75,000 passive belt\u00ad equipped Rabbits through Novem\u00ad ber 1977. Ford had earlier manufac\u00ad tured 831 air bag-equipped Mer\u00ad curys. In 1972, the standard was amended to require an ignition interlock system on front safety belts to force their use before the vehicle could be started. However, as a result of widespread adverse public reaction to the ignition interlock system, the Congress voided that requirement in 1974. The Congress also included in this legislation3 the provision for a 60- day period in which it could disap\u00ad prove, by means of a concurrent resolution, any standard which re\u00ad quired an occupant restraint system other than safety belts. In March 1974, Safety Administration offic\u00ad ials determined that an adequate test dummy had been developed and proposed mandatory passive restraints. In December 1976 the Secretary of Transportation called for a pas\u00ad sive restraint demonstration pro\u00ad gram rather than a mandate. In his deCision, the Secretary noted that the prospect of the Federal Govern\u00ad ment mandating passive restraints in all automobiles had become increasingly controversial. Ques\u00ad tions about effectiveness, reliabil\u00ad ity, cost, governmental interference in the lives of individuals, and public acceptability had been raised by, opponents of the air bag-the most publicized form of passive restraints. GAO Review/Summer 1980 The Secretary called upon the automobile manufacturers to join the Federal Government in a pro\u00ad gram demonstrating the effective\u00ad ness of passive restraints. The Secretary stated that he was con\u00ad vinced that passive restraints were technologically feasible, would pro\u00ad vide the public with substantially increased protection in traffic acci\u00ad dents, and could be produced eco\u00ad nomically. However, in his Decem\u00ad ber 6, 1976 decision concerning motor vehicle occupant crash pro\u00ad tection, he cited the following major reasons for proposing a demonstration program rather than mandating passive restraints: First, the goal of motor vehicle safety would not be served by a mandate of passive restraints which is ultimately rejected by the public. I believe that if the public does not have an oppor\u00ad tunity to become familiar with the benefits of passive restraints prior to their installation in all cars, a strong negative reaction is likely. Second, such a mandate would mean replacing the lap and shoulder seat belt system that is effective when used, with passive restraint systems, which have operating characteristics unlike those of any other safety equip\u00ad ment now in automobiles and which [in the case of air bags] are among the most costly automo\u00ad bile safety devices that have been Federally required to date. Third, two important outcomes could result from such a demon\u00ad stration program which would be foreclosed by a mandate at the present time. First, a demonstra\u00ad tion program could create suffic\u00ad ient consumer demand for pas\u00ad sive restraints that manufacturers would voluntarily offer them as an option at a reasonable price or as standard equipment. Second, it is possible that the Depart\u00ad ment's efforts to increase levels of seat belt use would lead to a conclusion that much higher voluntary belt use than we predict could be achieved. In January 1977, Secretary of Transportation Brock Adams recon\u00ad sidered the December 1976 deciSion and reopened the question of man\u00ad dating passive restraints. There- GAO Review/Summer 1980 Reviewing an Automoblle Safety Standard: A Unique Service to the Congress fore, demonstration contracts with General Motors and Ford Motor Company were terminated. The Secretary cited the following rea\u00ad sons for this shift: Public acceptance or rejec\u00ad tion of passive restraints is not one of the statutory criteria which the Depart\u00ad ment is charged by law to apply in establishing stan\u00ad dards. Passive restraints, when fully integrated into the U.S. automotive fleet, will prevent 12,000 traffic deaths annu\u00ad ally, or about 9,000 more than the current active safety belt systems. Passive restraints can be in\u00ad stalled at a reasonable cost to the customer ($112 for air bags and $25 for passive safety belts), and the cost of the systems will be more than offset through insur\u00ad ance savings. Use of sodium azide as the gas generator for air bags would present no insur\u00ad mountable health, safety, or environmental problems. On June 30, 1977, Secretary Adams mandated passive restraint systems. Under the rulemaking pro\u00ad cedures, the standard does not become effective if a concurrent resolution of disapproval is passed by the Congress during the 60-day period. During this period both the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation and the House Subcommittee on Consumer Protection and Finance, Committee on Interstate and Foreign Com\u00ad merce, held hearings on the passive restraint standard. On October 12, 1977, the Congress rejected moves to overturn the Secretary's man\u00ad date, thereby confirming his deci\u00ad sion to have passive restraints installed in automobiles starting with the 1982 models. The Case For Air Bags -The Life-Saving Potential Passive restraints do offer life\u00ad saving and injury prevention poten\u00ad tial. The Safety Administration estimated that passive restraints, when installed in all cars, would prevent about 9,000 deaths and 65,000 serious injuries each year. In calling for the passive restraint mandate, the Safety Administration cited the following conditions: The number of fatalities in motor vehicle aCCidents is increasing and is estimated to be greater than 50,000 per year, with more than half being front seat occupants of passenger cars who could be protected from frontal crashes by automatic re\u00ad straints. The potential for more ser\u00ad ious accidents is increasing because consumers are buy\u00ad ing smaller, lighter passen\u00ad ger cars to conserve energy. At least two practical types of systems providing auto\u00ad matic crash protection to ve\u00ad hicle occupants have been successfully produced for sale to the public. Other proponents of air bags, such as the Allstate Insurance Company, conclude that passenger fatalities could have been about 65.9 percent lower and 18,200 lives saved in 1976, if air bags were used. Cost Offset By Insuranee Diseounts The Safety Administration esti\u00ad mated that passive restraints could be installed at a reasonable cost to the customer (about $200) and the cost would be more than offset by insurance discounts. The underlying theme of cam\u00ad paigns sponsored by the insurance industry was the assertion that savings on insurance premiums would offset a major portion and possibly all of the system'S cost to the consumer. The Safety Adminis\u00ad tration said that one should com\u00ad pare the cost of automatic re\u00ad straints with the cost of other options that have been \"embraced\" by car buyers, such as air condi\u00ad tioning at $500 and automatic transmissions at about $300. They say the average new car has nearly $1000 in comfort, convenience, and appearance options. SodiulD Azide The Department of Transporta\u00ad tion said it was satisfied that 45 Reviewing an Automobile Safety Standard: A Unique Service to the Congress sodium azide-the chemical used in the air bag system to generate gases to fill the air bags-could be used safely in an industrial setting and in automobiles. Sodium azide has been shown to be a mutagen of plant life, bacteria, and animal cells; however, insufficient testing has been done to show if it is a mutagen in humans. It has the potential to form a highly explosive reaction should it come into contact with heavy metals, such as copper or lead, during the scrapping pro\u00ad cess. The Safety Administration real\u00ad izesthe potential hazards that may arise with the use of sodium azide in air bags. However, along with its sister agencies, the Environmental Protection Agency and the Occupa\u00ad tional Safety and Health Adminis\u00ad tration, and the automobile manu\u00ad facturers, it believes it is acting in a responsible way to ensure that the use of sodium azide in air bags will not introduce any substantial new hazards to public health and safety, or to the environment. The most significant problem foreseen by the Safety Administra\u00ad tion is in cars being scrapped with uninflatable air bags. However, the Safety Administration assumed this problem could be solved by simple technical devices or by well\u00ad enforced regulations. The Case Against Air Bags -Test Data LilDited The quantification of benefits reported by the proponents of the air bag system asserts a degree of certainty that is not supported by test data. In making estimates, such as 9,000 lives will be saved each year, the Safety Administra\u00ad tion and others relied primarily on laboratory test data and engineering judgment because sufficient field experience was not available. Esti\u00ad mated benefits are uncertain due to limitations in the test data and a lack of knowledge about human responses in crashes and human tolerance to injuries. Another limitation in the test data is the lack of air bag testing in small cars. In the future, cars will be smaller and lighter, which presents a more difficult task in managing crash forces. Unfortunately, most 46 of the air bag testing was restricted to large cars. Relating this large car data to small cars presents an element of uncertainty in estimating effectiveness. Actual field experience with air bags is limited to about 12,000 cars. A little more than 200 of these cars have been involved in crashes in which the bags were deployed. The accuracy of estimates is ques\u00ad tionable because of the small number of accidents and the uncer\u00ad tainties in the input data. Furthermore, the question of air bag effectiveness is clouded by the results of some recent testing by General Motors and Volvo which in\u00ad dicated a problem may exist with out-of-position occupants, espec\u00ad ially small children. As was pre\u00ad viously discussed, the air bag de\u00ad ploys with tremendous speed and impact, and, as a resuit, out-of\u00ad position occupants may be injured by the force of the bag inflating. Air Bags {;ould Be {;ostly Early cost estimates of air bags are at best tenuous. For example, the Safety Administration esti\u00ad mated that air bags would cost $112 per automobile. Some recent fig\u00ad ures by General Motors and Ford indicate that the cost for air bags will be considerably more. General Motors said for its 1982 model year cars, on a projected volume of 400,000 units, the cost (in 1979 dollars) would be $581. In July 1979, Ford said, based on a projected volume of 200,000 units, the estimate for air bags was $828. Furthermore, a general estimate of the cost of replacing an air bag that deployed in an accident is about 2.5 times the original cost. Proponents claim that passive restraints will result in significant insurance premium discounts; how\u00ad ever, the ultimate effect of these devices on insurance rates remains to be seen. Some major insurance companies indicated that they will provide prem ium discounts for pas\u00ad sive restraint-equipped cars. Others have not committed themselves to offering any discounts, and still others said they do not plan to offer discounts for cars equipped with passive restraints. Regardless of their present position on discounts, the consensus among the insurance companies was that their rates would ultimately depend on the ef\u00ad fectiveness of passive restraints in reducing injuries and deaths, and on economic variables, such as inflation, car deSign, and competi\u00ad tion. When some 50 agents in three eastern seaboard States were asked for quotations on cars with air bags, some representatives offered an average discount of $3.44 on a $281 policy, others a $2.29 discount on a $312 policy. One Congressman commented, \"at this rate, air bags would offset their cost to the con\u00ad sumer in just over 80 years.\" It has also been pOinted out that the added costs of collision coverage for air bag-equipped cars will absorb all or part of any possible savings on medical and personal injury premiums. For example, one auto club publication estimated that, in its State, a possible $13 savings on personal injury coverage would be accompanied by a $45 increase for collision coverage. Elleet 01 Sodium hide Uneertain Washington State University re\u00ad searchers concluded that sodium azide is a powerful mutagen in rodent cells. However, before the degree of risk can be determined, it will be necessary to determine the amount of unburned sodium azide that a car occupant is exposed to when an air bag deploys, and whether the chemical is a mutagen and/orcarcinogen to humans. Sod\u00ad ium azide is suspected to be a carcinogen, based on some re\u00ad searchers' observations that a high correlation exists between a muta\u00ad gen and carcinogen. In the scrapping process, workers may come into direct contact with the chemical, causing adverse health effects similar to those noted in some production workers (I.e., ranging from mild headaches to prostration). Also, sodium azide can be highly explosive when it contacts such heavy metals as copper or lead which are common in automobile scrap yards. Input of GAO Some Members of Congress, their staffs, and staffs of certain subcommittees did not believe that GAO Review/Summer 1980 there was a need for GAO to perform this review. They stated that the Congress, by not over\u00ad turning or modifying the standard, had, in effect, accepted it. On the other hand, some Members of Congress felt that they were limited in making their decisions because of a lack of information on posi\u00ad tions taken by proponents or op\u00ad ponents of passive restraint sys\u00ad tems. GAO said there was a need for a closer look at this controvers\u00ad ial subject to provide the Congress with information which would help it fulfill its basic legislative and oversight responsibilities. GAO was well aware that there may not be answers to many of the key questions. However, there was an overriding need for a full and im\u00ad partial airing of the basic issues on this subject. The subject became so contro\u00ad versial that when anyone, especially GAO, raised any questions about effectiveness, cost, or any related matter, they were immediately la\u00ad beled as anti-air bag and against auto safety. Even after GAO issued its report, and in several places in the report pointed out that \"passive restraints offer life-saving and in\u00ad jury prevention potential,\" it made no difference to proponents of the air bag. GAO was still accused of being against safety on the high\u00ad way. Because of the importance of the mandate in terms of cost and safety to the American public, GAO be\u00ad lieved the actual experience with passive restraints needed to be evaluated. To this end, and to develop an effective program to evaluate \"real world data,\" GAO concluded that the Secretary of Transportation should establ ish a task force of representatives from the Safety Administration, the insurance industry and inde\u00ad pendent highway safety re\u00ad searchers to develop an eval\u00ad uation plan; require the Safety Adminis\u00ad tration to collect and analyze the data needed to analyze the plan; and modify the safety standard, as warranted. How successful was GAO in its efforts and just what effect did its GAO Review/Summer 1980 Reviewing an AutomobUe Safety Standard: A Unique Service to the Congress report have? Based on actions by the House Rules Committee and amendments to the Transportation Authorization Bill on the House floor, it can easily be said that the GAO report and its message has been recognized. Shortly after the report was issued, the House passed an amendment to the 1980 Transporta\u00ad tion Appropriations Bill prohibiting the use of funds to implement or enforce any standard or regulation which requires any motor vehicle to be equipped with an occupant re\u00ad straint system other than a belt system, but permits the use of funds for research and development relating to occupant restraint sys\u00ad tems. This amendment, according to certain Congressmen, carried out essentially the major recommenda\u00ad tions of the GAO report. More re\u00ad cently, the House approved another amendment to the automobile safety mandate, stating that con-sumers do not have to accept air bags if they don't want them. This amendment was somewhat symbol\u00ad ic in that it would apply to fiscal years 1980 and 1981 and, therefore, wou Id expire before the mandated safety standard would take effect. It is significant, however, from the point of view that the amendment may very well establish a precedent for similar amendments in future years when the mandate is to take effect. The jury is still out as to the final effect of the GAO review. Of short\u00ad range impact, the GAO work may result in some significant changes or modifications in the mandate. More importantly, and of long\u00ad range significance, the work of GAO may affect the procedures followed, the scope of work, etc., by the Safety Administration, in proposing additional rules and Fed\u00ad eral regulations on automobile safety standards.

Since GAO issued its report, some interesting things have taken place. First, Mr. Neil E. Gold\u00ad schmidt, who succeeded Mr. Adams as Secretary of Transportation in August 1979, acknowledged in March 1980 that \"Washington's attitude had changed\" with respect to the regulatory hand of the Federal Government. Further, hints that the Federal Government may be prepared to compromise in some regulatory areas was clearly evident in a March 1980 interview with Secretary Goldschmidt when he acknowledged that his department had been \"too preoccupied with mat\u00ad ters of mutual irritation, such as air bags, to deal with the real problem such as where the industry is going after 1985.\" Second, in June 1980, General Motors Corporation publicly announced that it will not offer air bags as an extra cost option on its large 1982 cars, but instead will make passive belts standard equip\u00ad ment. Joan Claybrook of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration accused GM of refusing to use existing technology to prevent thousands of high\u00ad way deaths and injuries. Reports in June 1980 indicated that automobile sales are at their lowest point since 1963. This, coupled with the fact that nearly 280,000 auto workers are out of work indefinitely, clearly adds to the need for some kind of Federal regulatory \"detente\" with automotive Detroit. 1 Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No. 208-0ccupant Crash Protection. 2 Passive restraints provide protection to occupants without any action on their part. 3 Public Law 93-492, \u00a7109, 88 Stat. 1570. 47 Marlo Artesiano Mr. Artesiano is an auditor with the Atlanta regional office.

Some eth\u00ad nic groups have been readily inte\u00ad grated into the predominant Anglo\u00ad American mold in a generation or two, while others have carefully preserved their ethnic identity. Cer\u00ad tainly some groups found absorp\u00ad tion into Anglo-American society easier than did others, realizing that leaving the old and accepting the new was necessary to prosper in the new land. On the other hand, many consciously chose to preserve the ancestral values of language, religion, and customs that set them apart. Proximity to a former home\u00ad land, reinforcement of homeland ties, and the very reasons for coming to America help explain such a choice. In some cases, society influenced the choice by of\u00ad fering only a second class citizen\u00ad ship. But whatever the degrees of assimilation, or reasons behind it, we are in effect a tapestry of peoples. As a result, today our na\u00ad tional character can be described in many languages, sampled in var\u00ad ious foods, and seen in our dif-ferent faces. Diversity is America's heritage and its future. This article offers a profile of Hispanic Ameri\u00ad cans, who have contributed signifi\u00ad cantly to our rich ethnic heritage. From September 14 through 20, we at GAO, along with the rest of the nation, will celebrate Hispanic Heritage Week. This event, in\u00ad augurated in 1968, is proclaimed annually by the President to recog\u00ad nize the central role Hispanics have played in our national development. Certainly all of America's peoples, not just Hispanics, have contri\u00ad buted to the nation's greatness and deserve recognition. A special com\u00ad memoration for the Spanish contri\u00ad bution reflects a concern that the country has not always properly ap\u00ad preciated its Spanish legacy and has often made Hispanics the victims of stereotype and prejudice. Appropriately, the week's activities focus on the positive. We celebrate the benefits of being receptive to all values in our country's diverse cul\u00ad tures and the advantages of giving all ethnic groups the opportunity to contribute their ideas, their exper\u00ad ience, and their energies to the betterment of American society. This recognition, done not in GAO Review / Summer 1980 atonement for wrongs, but in a spirit of pride in the past and hope for the future, sets the stage for National Hispanic Heritage Week 1980. Who They Are Comprised of several diverse and distinct ethnic groups, Hispanics are a multicultural people who share a common Iberian heritage and language. Multiracial as well, Hispanics are white, black, Indian, and blends of those races. They live, of course, in the familiar \"barrios\" of Los Angeles, in New York's Spanish Harlem, and in Miami's Little Havana, but increas\u00ad ingly in other American cities as well. Fueled by a high birth rate and by immigration both legal and illegal, the Hispanic population is growing rapidly and Hispanics will probably be the nation's largest minority by the end of the century.1 With an average age of 22, they are a young people and one that falls below national averages in income, education, and jobs. However, in a nation more minority-conscious than ever, His\u00ad paniCS are making headway. Some Hispanics were already here before America became Amer\u00ad ica, and many more have been arriv\u00ad ing ever since. While definite num\u00ad bers may not be available until after the 1980 census, some have esti\u00ad mated the current Hispanic popula\u00ad tion at 19 million, including undoc\u00ad umented aliens, but not counting the 3.3 million people of Puerto Rico.2 Although most Hispanics live in Florida, the southwest, and the northeast, they are also moving to places such as Chicago and Boston. Just as these cities were home to many European immi\u00ad grants during the late 1800's, they are now providing a home for His\u00ad paniC immigrants too. The number of Hispanics in some cities is hard to overlook. Los Angeles' Mexican population of one million is second only to Mexico City's; Miami's Cuban community of a half million is second only to Havana's; and New York City has more Puerto Ricans than San Juan. Although the various Hispanic groups speak the same language and have basically the same Span\u00ad ish colonial origins, each national GAO Review / Summer 1980 Figure 1.

Racially they may be European Spanish, a Carribean mixture of Spanish and black, or a Spanish Indian mestizo. In Latin America a greater blending of races took place than in Anglo America. The national cultures, food, music, habits, and customs vary from Mexican to Puerto Rican to Cuban to South American. Hispanics are a minority fractured into subgroups that too often regard themselves as distinct despite their common Spanish heri\u00ad tage, although increasingly the groups are uniting to solve their mutual social and economic prob\u00ad lems. Because of the differences among Hispanics, broad generali\u00ad zations run the risk of being inac\u00ad curate. But at least on a limited basiS, they do offer a composite picture of America's Hispanic citi\u00ad zens. Census statistics reveal a population that falls far below national averages in income, educa\u00ad tion, and jobs. Hispanic median Hispanic Americans - A Proffie family income is about $5000 below that of other American families; 23 percent of ,Hispanic families live below the poverty level, compared with about 9 percent for other American families. Only 40 percent of Hispanics over 25 have com\u00ad pleted high school, and about 9 percent of the HispaniC work force is unemployed, compared with 5.5 percent of all Americans. For a people long a part of our history, America's promise has often not come true. Ameriea's Hispanie Roots For over three centuries the predominant European influence in a much of what is now the United States was Hispanic. Spanish ex\u00ad plorers, conquerors, and settlers wrote much of America's early his\u00ad tory. As the United States expanded to the south and west into Hispanic lands, our nation absorbed the His\u00ad paniC peoples of these areas, and with this expansion came America's Hispanic heritage. As America ab\u00ad sorbed the existing Spanish and Indian influences in these areas, those influences broadened and enriched American culture. One authority has described the western European mastering of the Americas as follows: * * *The conquest of unknown lands of the New World spear\u00ad headed by the Spaniards, in\u00ad volved the Western nations in a tragic epic of cosmic propor\u00ad tions. No conquest in history has been pure, bloodless and compassionate, and that of the Americas was no exception. Even those that began as spiritual enterprises eventually twisted into adventures of war and exploitation.

It would be naive and even dishonest, to look with different eyes at the Indian, the Spanish, the French, the Portuguese or the English when studying the history of the New World. Nomadic Indians regularly raided and pillaged the Pueblo Indians. The conduct of the Conquistadores was frequently inspired by an unchecked thirst for gold, power, and glory. The Anglos subjugated, displaced, dispossessed, and eliminated entire Indian tribes and en\u00ad slaved the Africans, who in turn also used caste systems, slavery, exploitation and exter\u00ad mination of others whenever the circumstances 'r~ere propit\u00ad uous. No apologies or intellec\u00ad tualizations should be used to mask or deny the excesses and horrors. Just as no distortion or subterfuge should be used to suppress the positive things brought about in the colonizing of the Americas\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7. 3 The bulk of the colonization of the New World was a Hispanic experience. Discovered by Span\u00ad iards in 1492, by the middle of the 16th century Spain had explored all the continental United States coast\u00ad line, Mississippi River basin, Cali\u00ad fornia, and the lands southeast and southwest. Explorers such as Ponce de Leon, De Soto, and Coronado were the first Europeans to map the new land. Colonization followed, \"civilizing\" the Indians and spread\u00ad ing the Holy Faith. In 1565 Menen\u00ad dez de Aviles founded the first U.S. city, St. Augustine, and other Span\u00ad iards established settlements in the southwest and along the California coast. Spanish governors had charge of territory which now comprises 24 States, and stretched from Florida through the Louisiana territories, extended west and southwest, and finally reached the Pacific. Spain also greatly aided Amer\u00ad ica's fight for independence. Be\u00ad cause the 13 colonies were rebelling against England, Spain was sym\u00ad pathetic to their struggle. She pro\u00ad vided refuge for rebel ships in Cuban ports, gave loans and credits Hispanics by State-1976 (in thousands) NORTH DAKOTA 6 2 r:W~Y:;::OM~IN~G~--I SOUTH DAKOTA 2 16 NEBRASKA 25 COLORAOO ,,\\\\~,,\\\\ .Il KANSAS 278 NEW MEXICO 420 Alaska 6 Hawaii 28 of about $200 million, and even\u00ad tually joined the war against Great Britain. Don Bernardo Galvez, Spanish governor of Louisiana, weakened the English military posi\u00ad tion by taking Pensacola and other Gulf Coast fortifications at a critical time when the British had taken Savannah and Charleston. When General Washington lacked the funds to pay his army, the aristo\u00ad cracy of Havana provided the mon\u00ad ies. While this article cannot fully develop the Hispanic contribution to our nation's independence, the fact remains that two Latin nations, Spain and France,. gave the Colo\u00ad nies decisive help.4 For some Americans, awareness of our nation's Hispanic heritage begins and ends with a Mexican peasant in a sombrero and serape sleeping against the cantina or, for the romantics, a beautiful senorita dancing away in the arms of her hero. But Hispanic culture has given us so much more. The univer\u00ad sal American hero, the cowboy, is the anglicized version of the Mexi\u00ad can vaquero; his tools, language, and way of life were of Spanish origin. Our cattle industry owes Puerto Rico 3,300 Source: Bureau of the Census GAO Review / Summer 1980 much to its Spanish origins in Florida and the southwest, and Spanish law has influenced our nation's legal system in areas such as adoption, inheritance, home\u00ad stead rights, and protection for debtors.5 Hispanic irrigation and mining techniques led to increased American productivity, and we con\u00ad tinue to see evidence of our Hispanic legacy in architecture, the arts, sciences, and other fields. Perhaps most importantly, the labor of Hispanics helped build America. How unfortunate then, that for many Americans, the Hispanic legacy consists only of comic stereotypes. GAO's Role and Responsibilities GAO's involvement with Hispanic Americans is apparent in two vital areas-it employs them on its staff and works on the national issues affecting Hispanics. As an employ\u00ad er, GAO is committed to providing equal employment opportunities to Hispanics and other minorities. In its work for the Congress, GAO addresses issues that directly affect America's Hispanic population, such as bilingual education. Reflecting Government's concern over employment disparities affect\u00ad ing Hispanic Americans, GAO has implemented a special emphasis program to hire Hispanics. Similar to the Women's Program and organized within GAO's overall EEO program, this special emphasis effort is not a quota system or job giveaway program, but an outreach effort to get more Hispanics to seek employment with GAO. Mr. Staats believes GAO currently employs far less than the proportionate share of Hispanics having the skills to do our work, and is therefore encour\u00ad aging qualified Hispanics to seek positions in GAO. The heads of divisions and offices act as GAO's EEO officers and have been charged by the Comptroller General with carrying out our EEO program, while the director of EEO provides overall leadership and policy direc\u00ad tion. Some EEO officers have apPointed Hispanic Employment Program coordinators to serve as a resource person for the division or office in recruiting, and to com\u00ad municate progress and problems. GAO Review / Summer 1980 Although we have made some initial progress in Hispanic employ\u00ad ment since 1973, our profile has not improved much since 1976. As of February 1980, GAO had 115 Hispanic employees, or 1.9 percent of the total agency staff. This was far below both the propor\u00ad tion of Hispanics in the population (5.6 percent) and the Hispanic share of baccalaureate business graduates (6.6 percent). Other Gov\u00ad ernment agencies, with staffs com\u00ad prised of approximately 3.5 percent Hispanic, have apparently been more successful in their efforts to attract Hispanic employees. While we can offer valid reasons why our employment statistics are what they are-little overall growth, loss of Hispanic employees, no direct hiring authority-the fact remains that GAO has much to do in this area. Recent civil service reform changes in minority recruitment, the use of EEO performance in rating managers, and GAO's stated strong commitment to EEO give reasons for optimism in future Hispanic Amerlcans- A Profile improvement. Increasingly, issues involving Hispanics are issues of widespread national concern as well. GAO's reporting activities, in dealing with such concerns, are taking on added importance for America's Hispanic population. Obviously, our reviews of EEO and social programs try to come to terms with national efforts directly affecting Hispanics, but so does our work in such areas as trade, international development, and energy. Recent reviews6 with special relevance for Hispanics have included those on the illegal flow of drugs and people from Mexico, the status of Puerto Rico, and the Panama Canal Treaty. Our ability to draw upon the re\u00ad sources of our Hispanic staff, es\u00ad pecially on their unique linguistic and cultural insights+ can enrich our work in these and other areas. By attracting qualified Hispanics to GAO's staff, we serve the best interests of GAO, the nation, and those of Hispanic Americans as well.

The General Aeeounting Offiee Aet of 1980: The End of a Long Legislative Road As President Carter signs the General Accounting Office Act of 1980 he is watched by Comptroller General Staats, Senator John Glenn, Representative Jack Brooks and congressional and OMB aides. (White House photo). On April 3, 1980, the President signed H.R. 24 into law as the \"General Accounting Office Act of 1980.\"1 This legislation-often re\u00ad ferred to in GAO as the \"omnibus bill\"-(1) authorizes audits by GAO of \"unvouchered\" expenditures; (2) enables GAO to enforce its access to records rights in the courts; (3) imposes requirements on GAO's draft report comment process; (4) provides for enhanced congres\u00ad sional participation in the appoint\u00ad ment of the Comptroller and Deputy Comptroller General; and (5) re\u00ad quires certain executive agency inspectors general to comply with GAO auditing standards. At the time he signed the bill into law, President Carter noted that: * this legislation is the product of extensive discus\u00ad sions between the Executive branch and the Congress. 2 During Senate consideration of the legislation, its floor manager, Sen\u00ad ator Glenn, stated: *. this bill is a milestone in executive-legislative branch re\u00ad lations and resulted from a prodigious amount of staff work that included protracted negotiations with the adminis\u00ad tration and the GAO, both of whom support its pas\u00ad sage . 3 These statements are certainly true of H. R. 24, but they apply with equal force to a long line of prior bills which are the roots of H.R. 24. In fact, the origins of the General Accounting Office Act of 1980 can be traced back for at least a decade to bills introduced in 1970 and most years thereafter. This article des\u00ad cribes the extensive leg islative efforts that culminated with enact\u00ad ment of H. R. 24. GAO Review / Summer 1980 The First Bill\u00ad S.4432, 91st Congress On October 2, 1970, the Senate Committee on Government Opera\u00ad tions reported as an original bill S. 4432, 91 st Cong., the proposed \"Budget and Accounting Improve\u00ad ment Act of 1970.\" If anyone measure can lay claim to being the original \"omnibus bill\" it is S. 4432. This bill resulted from hearings held by the Senate Government Operations Committee in the fall of 1969 which constituted the first comprehensive review of GAO by that committee since Mr. Staats had become Comptroller General. 4 The committee report summarized the basic purposes and provisions of S. 4432 as follows: The purpose of this bill is to strengthen and broaden the operations under the Comptrol\u00ad ler General's Office in order to provide more effective service to Congress. To achieve this, the bill [1] assigns new respon\u00ad sibilities to the Comptroller General in analyzing and audit\u00ad ing Federal expenditures and reduces certain outmoded stat\u00ad utory auditing requirements relative to Government corpor\u00ad ations and certain other spec\u00ad ial Federal operations; [2] changes the name of the General Accounting Office to the Office of the Comptroller General of the United States; [3] grants the Office authority to employ experts and consUl\u00ad tants and subpoena records which it is presently authorized to review; [4] provides authority for the Comptroller General to institute suit and to appear in court, with his own counsel in certairi instances; and [5] en\u00ad larges the role of the Office in examining the operation of on\u00ad going programs and estab\u00ad lishes a new program of analy\u00ad zing legislative authorization and appropriation proposals. This is designed to make its activities more relevant and meaningful to the Congress in the 1970's. 5 While S. 4432 was not enacted, a number of its provisions became law during the early 1970's. For example, specific program evalua\u00ad tion authorities along the lines of GAO Review / Summer 1980 The General Accounting Office Act of 1980: The End of a Long Legislative Road those proposed in S. 4432 were contained in the Legislative Reor\u00ad ganization Act of 1970 as amended by the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.6 Likewise, the \"General Ac\u00ad counting Office Act of 1974\" revised a number of statutory audit require\u00ad ments and authorized the Comp\u00ad troller General to employ experts and consultants.7 Other provisions of S. 4432-changing the name of the GAO and authorizing the Comp\u00ad troller General to test his legal decisions in court-were eventually abandoned. The remaining item in S. 4432- granting GAO subpoena power\u00ad provides the most conSistent thread between the 1970 bill and the General Accounting Office Act of 1980. Section 601 of S. 4432 read: To assist in carrying out his functions, the Comptroller General may sign and issue subpoenas requiring the pro\u00ad duction of negotiated contract and subcontract records and records of other non-Federal persons or organizations to which he has a right of access by law or agreement. Section 602 authorized the Comp\u00ad troller General to obtain judicial enforcement of subpoenas. The language of S. 4432 is quite similar to the subpoena power en\u00ad acted this year, which enables GAO to enforce its access rights against non-Federal parties. However, S. 4432 did not include provisions for enforcement of GAO's access rights against Federal agencies. The Sen\u00ad ate report on S. 4432 focused upon GAO's occasional difficulties in getting contractor records, and observed: * * * in the simplest terms, [1] the subpoena would enable the Comptroller General to ob\u00ad tain much quicker resolution in the courts of any dispute over his authority and [2] the power to issue a subpoena WOUld, by its very existence, eliminate many disputes which may be raised merely to create delays. 6 The Senate passed S. 4432 by a voice vote on October 9, 1970,9 but no action was taken on the House side for the remainder of the 91 st Congress. B2d Congress Very little transpired in the 92d Congress by way of legislation affecting GAO's basic functions. Senator Ribicoff introduced as S. 1022 the same bi II that the Senate had passed the year before as S. 4432. However, no action was taken on this bill. The only other development of interest occurred on October 19, 1971, when Senator Ervin intro\u00ad duced S. 2702, a bill to authorize the Comptroller General to bring suit for declaratory and injunctive relief against any executive branch official: * * * whenever the Comptrol\u00ad ler General, in the performance of any of his functions author\u00ad ized by law, has reasonable cause to believe that such officer or employee is about to expend, obligate, or authorize in an illegal manner, the expen\u00ad diture or obligation of public funds over which the Comp\u00ad troller General has account set\u00ad tlement authority. This bill, which GAO supported at the time, 10 was deSigned to provide a means for judicial resolution of disagreements between the Comp\u00ad troller General and the Attorney General over the legality of Federal expenditures. It would have enabled GAO to prevent expenditures which GAO considered illegal before they occurred, rather than limiting our recourse to \"taking exception\" to payments already made. The approach taken in S. 2702- which had been included as well in S. 4432, 91 st Cong., and S. 1022, 92d Cong.-actually had its origins in the late 1960's as the resu It of a notable difference of opinion be\u00ad tween the Comptroller General and Attorney General over the legality of the so-called \"Philadelphia Plan,\" an affirmative action program devel\u00ad oped by the Labor Department for application to Federal contractors. The Comptroller General had ruled the plan illegal, but the Attorney General later disagreed and stated that his opinion should take prece\u00ad dence over the Comptroller's.\" The Senate then considered an appro\u00ad priation rider that read as follows: In view of and in confirma\u00ad tion of the authority vested in the Comptroller General of the 53 The General Accounting Office Act of 1980: The End of a Long Legislative Road United States by the Budget and Accounting Act of 1921, as amended, no part of the funds appropriated or otherwise made available by this or any other Act shall be available to finance, either directly or through any Federal aid or grant, any contract or agree\u00ad ment which the Comptroller General of the United States holds to be in contravention of any Federal statute. 12 President Nixon objected to the appropriation rider on the ground that it would prevent court review of the underlying legal issues. The President observed: When rulings differ, how\u00ad ever, when the chief legal officer of the executive branch and the chief watchdog of the Congress end up wiih oppos\u00ad ing views on the same matter of law, the place for resolution of such differences is the courts-just as it is for the resolution of differences be\u00ad tween private citizens. 13 He suggested that the appropriation rider \"should be modified to permit prompt court review of any differ\u00ad ences between legal opinions of the Comptroller General and those of the executive, and to permit the Comptroller General to have his own counsel (rather than the Attor\u00ad ney General) to represent him in such cases.\" The appropriation rider was re\u00ad jected. S. 2702, which would have implemented the alternative ap\u00ad proach suggested by the President, received no action in the Congress. 93d Congress GAO took a more active role in seeking legislation during the 93d Congress. On June 20, 1973, the Comptroller General submitted to the Congress a comprehensive draft bill captioned the \"Accounting and Auditing Act of 1973.\" This draft was introduced in the Senate by Senators Ervin, Metcalf, and Ribi\u00ad coff as S. 2049. ,. Representative introduced a companion House version as H.R. 9002. ,. Representatives Holifield and Hor\u00ad ton also introduced the bill, by re\u00ad quest, as H.R. 9091.'6 The comprehensive 1973 bill con\u00ad tained a number of provisions, 54 which can be summarized as fol\u00ad lows: Title I provided for judicial enforcement of GAO deci\u00ad sions, along the same lines as S. 2702, 92d Cong., and other provisions discussed above. Title II provided for the issuance and enforcement of subpoenas against non\u00ad Federal persons where GAO had a right of access. This language followed language in the 1970 Senate-passed bill, S. 4432, 91st Congo Title III provided for GAO to assist the Congress in devel\u00ad oping budget, fiscal, and program information. This is similar to the language ad\u00ad ded to section 203 of the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1970 by the Congres\u00ad sional Budget Act of 1974, 31 U.S.C. \u00a71153 (1976). Title IV expanded GAO's access rights to records of non-Federal parties to cover- Each recipient of Federal as\u00ad sistance pursuant to grants, contracts, subgrants, subcon\u00ad tracts, loans, or other arrange\u00ad ments, entered into other than by formal advertising***. Title IV also proposed for the first time a judicial remedy for GAO's access problems with Federal agen\u00ad cies. The bill provided that if a Federal agency had not granted GAO access within 20 days after a formal request, the Comptroller General could sue- For the purpose of decl'aring of the rights and other legal re\u00ad lations of the parties * * * and no further relief shall be sought by the parties or provided by the court. In other words, the court would merely determine whether GAO was or was not entitled to records; it would not issue any orders enforc\u00ad ing access. The bill provided for a three-judge Federal court to hear access questions. It also incorpo\u00ad rated a cong ressional veto mecha\u00ad nism to prevent GAO from bringing suit if either House of Congress disapproved. Title V of the bill granted the Comptroller General exclu\u00ad sive custody and control over the GAO building. Title VI authorized GAO to conduct \"profits studies\" of Government contractors or subcontractors doing more than $1 million of business with the Government in a fis\u00ad cal year.'7 Title VII allowed the Comp\u00ad troller General to fix the I im it for statistical sampling of vouchers, in lieu of the stat\u00ad utory limit of $100 per vouch\u00ad er then and re\u00ad quired GAO to evaluate sta\u00ad tistical sampling procedures in its audits of accounting systems. Title VIII proposed to trans\u00ad fer primary responsibility for audits of transportation pay\u00ad ments from GAO to the Office of Management and Budget. Title IX authorized GAO to audit nonappropriated fund activities. Title X authorized the Comp\u00ad troller General to hire ex\u00ad perts and consultants. Title XI changed the fre\u00ad quency requirements for GAO audits of Government corporations from every year to once every 3 years; and title XII placed on a discre\u00ad tionary basis other requ ire\u00ad ments for annual audits. As it turned out, the 1973 legis\u00ad lation was a little too comprehen\u00ad sive,and it languished in committee in both Houses. The strategy to get the legislation moving, developed by GAO and congressional staff members, was to divide the com\u00ad prehensive bill into two separate measures. In letters to Senator Ervin and Representative Holifield dated December 19, 1973, the Comptroller General formally sug\u00ad gested that the two new measures be substituted for the comprehen\u00ad sive bill: * * * we believe that consider\u00ad ation of the various provisions of S. 2049 could be Simplified and expedited if the bill were divided into two separate bills; one dealing with relatively straightforward provisions re\u00ad lating to largely routine GAO Review! Summer 1980 changes in this agency's activi\u00ad ties and a second bill dealing with what may be considered more profound and complex issues relating to our func\u00ad tions.'9 And so were born the \"controver\u00ad sial\" and \"noncontroversial\" GAO bills. The \"controversial\" bill, called the \"Accounting and Auditing Act of 1973,\" consisted of the following provisions from the comprehensive bill: judicial enforcement of GAO decisions (title I); subpoena power (title II); budget, fiscal, and pro\u00ad gram information (title III); access to records (title IV); and the profits study authorization (title VI). The \"noncontroversial\" bill, la\u00ad beled the \"General Accounting Office Act of re\u00ad maining provisions from the com\u00ad prehensive bill: statistical sampling (title VII); transfer of transportation payment audits (title VIII); nonap\u00ad propriated fund audits (title IX); employment of experts and consul\u00ad tants (title X); control over the GAO building (title V); and changes in the frequency of statutory audit requirements (title XI and XII). Senator Ervin introduced the noncontroversial bill as S. 3013, and the controversial bill as S. 3014.20 On December 21, 1973, Representatives Holifield and Hor\u00ad ton had likewise introduced these bills as H.R. 12113 and H.R. 12114, respectively. The predictions underlying the splitting of the GAO bill proved to be accurate. The \"controversial\" bill went nowhere. However, the \"non\u00ad controversial\" bill was enacted as the \"General Accounting Office Act of 1974\" in much the same form as first introduced.21 94th Congress The \"controversial\" bill was intro\u00ad duced again the next year as S. 2268, \"General Accounting Office Act of 1975. ,,22 This bill was identi\u00ad cal to the prior year's version except that it omitted the title on budget, fiscal, and program information, the substance of which had been included in the Congressional Bud\u00ad get Act of 1974. Earlier in the first session of the 94th Congress, Senator Metcalf and Representative Brooks had intro\u00ad duced bills which in some respects provide the antecedents of the GAO Review/Summer 1980 The General Accounting Office Act of 1980: The End of a Long Legislative Road provisions in the General Account\u00ad ing Office Act of 1980 concern i ng the appointment method of the Comptroller General and the Deputy Comptroller General. Senator Met\u00ad calf's bill, S. 2206, proposed to have the Comptroller and Deputy Comptroller General appointed by the Speaker of the House of Repre\u00ad sentatives and the President pro tempore of the Senate, after con\u00ad sideration of recommendations from the House and Senate Com\u00ad mittees on Government Operations. It would also have reduced the Comptroller's term of office from 15 to 7 years and provided for the Deputy's term to coincide with the Comptroller's. Finally, it provided for removal of the Comptroller or Deputy by simple resolution of either House of Congress. Another bill (S. 2205), which Senator Met\u00ad calf introduced on the same day, likewise provided for congressional appointment of the Librarian of Congress, the Architect of the Capitol, and the Public Printer. The Senator described these two bills as \"together consitut[ing] a con\u00ad gressional declaration of indepen\u00ad dence from the White House.\"23 Hearings on several bills, includ\u00ad ing S. 2206 and S. 2268, were held by Senator Metcalf's Subcommittee on Reports, Accounting, and Man\u00ad agement, Senate Committee on Government Operations, on Octo\u00ad ber 2, 1975. While the Comptroller General supported S. 2268, he opposed S. 2206. Neither bill was reported from committee. Representative Brooks' bill, H.R. 8616, also provided for congres\u00ad sional appointment of the Comp\u00ad troller General as well as the officials covered by Senator Met\u00ad calf's S. 2205. The Brooks bill provided for the Comptroller Gener\u00ad al to be nominated by the Joint Committee on Congressional Oper\u00ad ations, appointed by the Speaker of the House and the President pro tempore of the Senate, and con\u00ad firmed by a majority vote of each House of Congress. H.R. 8616 also provided for the Comptroller to appoint his own Deputy, who would serve at the pleasure of the Comp\u00ad troller. Finally the bill reduced the Comptroller's term to 10 years and provided for his removal by con\u00ad current resolution of the Con\u00ad gress.24 The next several years saw no formal legislative initiates along the lines of S. 2268 and other versions of the \"controversial\" GAO bill. The closest legislation was H.R. 12729, 94th Cong., introduced by Repre\u00ad sentative Abzug on March 23, 1976, for the purpose of- affirm[ing] the authority of the Comptroller General to have access to any books, documents, papers, or records of any Federal department or establishment for managerial and operational as well as for fiscal reviews and evaluation. The Abzug bill was designed to overcome GAO's problems in gain\u00ad ing access to FBI records and to respond to the argument occasion\u00ad ally raised by executive branch officials that GAO's access was limited to records relating to finan\u00ad cial matters. The bill would have added to GAO's basic access authority under section 313 of the Budget and Accounting Act, 1921, 31 U.S.C. \u00a754, and explicit provi\u00ad sion that our access rights- shall not be restricted to only those books, documents, papers, and records pertaining to the receipts, disbursement, or application of public funds, but shall extend to all books, documents, papers, or records within the possession or con\u00ad trol of any such department or establishment. The Comptroller General supported the Abzug bill since it endorsed GAO's current legal position, but pOinted out that what was really needed was an enforcement author\u00ad ity such as the access remedies proposed in S. 2268.25 While progress was slow toward enactment of a general access en\u00ad forcement remedy for GAO, signifi\u00ad cant developments had occurred, and continued to occur in some areas. On May 7, 1974, the Federal Energy Administration Act was signed into law converting the old Federal Energy Office into a new statutory agency.26 Section 12 of the act, 88 Stat. 106 (15 U.S.C. \u00a7771 ), gave GAO broad authority to monitor and evaluate the operations of the Federal Energy Adminis\u00ad tration. This audit authority was ac\u00ad companied by an equally broad 55 The General Accounting Office Act of 1980: The End of a Long Legislative Road grant of access to information materials from- * * * any person owning or operating facilities or business premises who is engaged in any phase of energy supply or major energy consumption, where such material relates to the purposes of this Act * * *. Also, section 12 gave the Comptrol\u00ad ler General subpoena power, for the first time ever, in connection with his broad audit and access rights under the act. This subpoena power could only be exercised, however, with the prior concurrence of an appropriate congressional commit\u00ad tee reflected by adoption of a committee resolution. In late 1975, title V of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act was enacted.27 This legislation granted the Comptroller General authority to conduct verification examina\u00ad tions with respect to persons sub\u00ad mitting energy information to desig\u00ad nated Federal agencies. Title V also granted the Comptroller General authority to issue and enforce subpoenas in connection with veri\u00ad fication audits and to issue orders imposing civil penalities on persons who refused to grant GAO access. Unlike the Federal Energy Adminis\u00ad tration Act, use of the title V enforcement remedies was not made subject to prior congressional approval. Section 6 of the Medicare-Medi\u00ad caid Anti-Fraud and Abuse Amend\u00ad ments, enacted in 1977,28 added a new section 1125 to the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a71320a-4, which granted the Comptroller Gen\u00ad eral authority to issue and enforce subpoenas for the production by any person of information relevant to GAO audits of programs author\u00ad ized under the Social Security Act. Section 207 of the Department of Energy Organization Acee applied GAO's authority under section 12 of the Federal Energy Administration Act, discussed above, to all func\u00ad tions of the newly established Energy Department. In addition to the legislation granting GAO subpoena power in particular instances, the Congress also enacted legislation dealing with longstanding access disputes between GAO and certain Federal agencies. The act, approved Octo- 56 ber 7, 1977, Public Law 95-125, provided express statutory author\u00ad ity for GAO audits of the Internal Revenue Service and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms of the Treasury Department. 30 The act thus removed objections by execu\u00ad tive branch officials that GAO had no right to conduct program audits of the IRS and BATF. The Federal Banking Agency Audit Act, approved July 21, 1978, as Public Law 95-320, granted GAO audit and access to records author\u00ad ity with regard to the Federal bank regulatory agencies.31 D.R. lel. 71, 95th Congress While no comprehensive GAO bill was introduced in 1976 and 1977, there were extensive behind-the\u00ad scenes discussions among GAO officials and congressional staff members. By the fall of 1977, these discussions had focused on the following potential subject areas for a bill: GAO audits of so-called \"unvouchered\" expenditures; gen\u00ad eral access to records enforcement powers; revisions in the method of appointment of the Comptroller General and Deputy Comptroller General; GAO's process of getting agency comments on draft reports; revisions in the system governing GAO personnel; and revision of the Comptroller General retirement pro\u00ad visions. Other subject areas of prior year GAO \"omnibus\" bills-en\u00ad forcement of legal decisions and permanent authority to conduct profit studies-had been dropped. On February 28, 1978, the Comp\u00ad troller General formally transmitted a package of three draft bills to Chairman Brooks of the House Committee on Government Opera\u00ad tions and Chairman Ribicoff of the Senate Committee on Governmen\u00ad tal Affairs.32 One draft bill pro\u00ad posed to amend the Comptroller General's retirement and survivor\u00ad ship law; another was the GAO personnel legislation.33 The third draft bill, captioned the \"Federal Accounting and Auditing Act of 1978,\" was the latest version of the \"controversial\" GAO bill. On April 18, 1978, Chairman Brooks intro\u00ad duced the proposed Federal Ac\u00ad counting and Auditing Act of 1978 as H.R. 12171, 95th Congress. As originally introduced, H.R. 12171 had three basic provisions (the first section being the \"short title\" of the bill), which may be summarized as follows: Section 2 of the bill proposed to amend section 117 of the Accounting and Auditing Act of 1950 by adding a new sub\u00ad section providing for GAO audits of \"unvouchered\" ex\u00ad penditures; i.e., \"expendi\u00ad tures * * * accounted for sole\u00ad lyon the approval, authori\u00ad zation, or certificate of the President of the United States or an official of a de\u00ad partment or establish\u00ad ment ***.\" The Comptroller General was granted access to such information as he deemed necessary \"to deter\u00ad mine whether the expendi\u00ad ture was, in fact, actually made and whether such ex\u00ad penditure was authorized by law.\" The proposed unvouch\u00ad ered expenditure audit can be traced back to concerns expressed in earlier years by Representative Eckhardt that greater accountability was necessary in the use of con\u00ad fidential funds. Much of the language in section 2 of H.R. 12171 was taken from a bi II introduced by Representative Eckhardt in 1977.3 ' Section 3 of H.R. 12171 pro\u00ad posed to give GAO across\u00ad the-board authority to en\u00ad force its existing access rights with regard to Federal agencies and non-Federal parties. It would have amen\u00ad ded section 313 of the Bud\u00ad get and Accounting Act, 1921, to provide that if any department or establishment failed to make records avail\u00ad able to GAO within 20 days after a request under the 1921 act or any other provi\u00ad sion of law or agreement granting the Comptroller General access, the Comp\u00ad troller General could bring an enforcement action in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. Section 3 also granted the Comptroller authority to is\u00ad sue, and enforce in the courts, subpoenas \"requir- GAO Review/Summer 1980 ing the production of con\u00ad tractor and subcontractor records pertaining to negot\u00ad iated contracts and records of other non-Federal persons or organizations to which he [the Comptroller] has a right of access by any law or agreement.\" This authority was similar to earlier GAO bills. Section 4 of the bill revised the procedure for appoint\u00ad ment of the Comptroller General and the appointment and term of the Deputy Comptroller General. The bill retained the feature of the present law that the Comp\u00ad troller be appointed by the President, subject to Senate confirmation, but it required the President to make his appointment from a list of persons submitted to him by a commission composed of the Speaker of the House, the President pro tempore of the Senate, the majority and minority leaders of the House and Senate, and the chair\u00ad man and ranking minority member of the House Gov\u00ad ernment Operations Com\u00ad mittee and the Senate Gov\u00ad ernmental Affairs. After con\u00ad sultation with the President, the commission would sub\u00ad mit at least three names to the President. The President could request additional names. Fina\"y, section 4 provided that the Deputy Comptroller General be ap\u00ad pointed by, and serve at the pleasure of, the Comptroller General. This would have eliminated the Presidential appointment for the Deputy and also the statutory 15- year term of office. H eari n gs on H . R. 1 2171 were held on May 17 and June 26, 1978.35 Comptroller General Staats testified in support of all provisions in H.R. 12171. However, the bill was opposed by Larry A. Ham\u00ad mond, a Deputy Assistant Attorney General with the Justice Depart\u00ad ment. Mr. Hammond's objections centered on sections 3 and 4 of the bill. He suggested that, while the section 3 access enforcement pro\u00ad visions as applied to Federal agen- GAO Review/Summer 1980 The General Accounting Office Act of 1980: The End of a Long Legislative Road cies were probably constitutional, it would be preferable to leave such access disputes for informal resolu\u00ad tion without involving the courts. He also testified that the proposed change in the appointment process for the Comptroller General under section 4, requiring the President to nominate from a list of names submitted by congressional offi\u00ad cials, would violate the ApPoint\u00ad ments Clause of the Constitution (Article 2, \u00a72, cl. 2) since the Comptroller performs some \"execu\u00ad tive\" functions. On September 19, 1978, the House Committee on Government Operations favorably reported H. R. 12171 without amendments. 36 However, two changes were made in the bill before it was brought up for House action. First, language was added to the unvouchered expenditure provisions in section 2 to authorize the President to exempt from GAO audit sensitive informa\u00ad tion concerning foreign intelligence and counterintelligence activities. Exempted transactions were to be reviewable by the House and Senate Intelligence Committees. Second, the provisions in section 4 concern\u00ad ing the appointment and term of the Deputy Comptroller General were modified to meet potential Senate objections. The modification re\u00ad turned the Deputy to a presidential appointee, subject to the new appointment procedures applicable to the Comptroller. Also, rather than have the Deputy serve at the pleasure of the Comptroller, the Deputy's term was made to expire at the same time as the Comptrol\u00ad ler's. The full House passed the bill by voice vote on October 3,37 but the Senate did not act on the bill. In the waning days of the 95th Congress, an attempt was made to secure Senate passage of H.R. 12171. However, when it became clear that the only provision that could pass at that stage was the subpoena power for non-Federal parties, the congressional sponsors, in consul\u00ad tation with GAO officials, decided not to push for Senate passage. H.R. 24 and S. 1878 It was back to the drawing board with the GAO bill when the 96th Congress convened in January 1979. However, very little time was lost. On the first day of the new Congress-January 15, 1979- Representative Brooks introduced H.R. 24, the \"General Accounting Office Act of 1979. ,,38 The intro\u00ad duced version of H.R. 24 was quite similar to the bill that passed the House the year before. It included the unvouchered expenditure audit provision as section 101, enforce\u00ad ment of access to records as section 102, and the provisions relating to the appointment of the Comptroller and Deputy Comptrol\u00ad ler General as section 104. The 1979 bill also included two new provisions. Section 103, cap\u00ad tioned \"Availability of Draft Re\u00ad ports,\" provided that a draft GAO report could not be made available for agency comments for period in excess of 30 days, unless the Comptroller General determined that a longer period was necessary and was likely to result in improving the accuracy or reliability of the report. Section 103 further provided that GAO could solicit agency comments on \"only those portions of such reports which contained, in the opinion of the Comptroller General, factual determinations and conclusions ***.\" Finally, H.R. 24 contained a title II, which required the Inspectors General of the De\u00ad partment of Energy and the Depart\u00ad ment of HEW to conform to GAO auditing standards. Introduction of H.R. 24 was fol\u00ad lowed by a period of intensive but protracted discussions involving GAO and executive branch officials, presided over by the staff of the House Government Operations Committee. The object was to arrive at a version of the bill that all parties could support. The result of these initial efforts was an \"Amend\u00ad ment in the Nature of a Substitute to H. R. 24,\" prepared by the com\u00ad mittee staff. 39 The amendment made several significant changes in H.R. 24. It added to section 102 a requirement that the Comptroller General give the Attorney General an additional 20 days notice before an action to enforce access against a Federal agency could be initiated. It removed from section 103 the prohibition against GAO obtaining comments on portions of draft reports other than factual deter\u00ad minations and conclusions. The 57 The General Accounting Office Act of 1980: The End of a Long Legislative Road new section 103 added a require\u00ad ment that whenever GAO requested agency comments on a draft report, the draft was to be made available upon request to certain congres\u00ad sional officials. Also, the Comptrol\u00ad ler General was required by the new section 103 to prepare and issue with the final version of the report a statement of any significant changes from prior drafts in the findings, conclusions or recom\u00ad mendations which were based on the agency comments, and the reasons for such changes. Finally, and perhaps most significantly, the amendment changed section 104 to provide that the congressional com\u00ad mission \"recommend\" individuals to the President for appointment as Comptroller General and Deputy Comptroller General. No longer was the President legally required to nominate candidates from those names submitted by the commis\u00ad sion. The Amendment in the Nature of a Substitute did meet some of the objections that had been raised to the bill. The changes in section 104 removed the Justice Department's constitutional objection to the ap\u00ad pointment provisions. However, the executive branch officials stood firm in their objections to sections 101 and 102, particularly the access enforcement remedy against Feder\u00ad al agencies, and Director Mcintyre of the Office of Management and Budget testified against these sec\u00ad tions of the bill. 40 Notwithstanding the executive branch objections, the House Com\u00ad m ittee favorably reported H. R. 24, with the text of the Amendment in the Nature of a Substitute, by a vote of 33 to 0.41 On October 29, 1979, the full House passed H.R. 24 under suspension of the rules. 42 The only change from the reported version of the bill was a provision, requested by the House Permanent Select Intelligence Committee and agreed to by Representative Brooks, which precluded use of the access enforcement remedies in section 102 to obtain information relating to presidentially designated foreign intelligence or counterintelligence activities. With House passage of H.R. 24, attention once again turned to the Senate, where H.R. 12171 had died the year before. However, the result 58 would be different this time. On October 11, 1979, Senator Glenn introduced a Senate version of the General Accounting Office Act of 1979 as S. 1878. 43 This bill was very similar to the House-passed bill except that it omitted the provisions on GAO draft reports. On October 16, 1979, Senator Glenn's Subcommittee of the Sen\u00ad ate Committee on Governmental Affairs held hearings on S. 1878. 44 The only witnesses at the October 16 hearing were Comptroller Gener\u00ad al Staats and other GAO officials. They supported S. 1878 in full, but recommended that the House\u00ad passed language on GAO draft reports be added to the Senate bill. At this pOint it appeared that the bill might have clearsailing, as no exec\u00ad utive branch official had accepted the Senate Subcommittee's invita\u00ad tion to testify. However, it soon be\u00ad came clear that the executive branch objections had not dissi\u00ad pated. Several executive agencies sent letters to the Senate Commit\u00ad tee opposing the bill, and on December 6, 1979, Deputy Assis\u00ad tant Attorney General Hammond again testified against the legisla\u00ad tion. Once more the executive branch objections focused upon the section 102 access to records en\u00ad forcement remedy against Federal agencies. These objections prompted another round of internal negotia\u00ad tions, this time under the auspices of the Senate Subcommittee staff. The Senate negotiations resulted in a rewrite by Senator Glenn of section 102 of the bill, which ultimately provided the compromise leading to enactment of the bill. The essence of this amendment was to specify certain categories of information for which the Comptrol\u00ad ler General could not invoke his ac\u00ad cess enforcement authority. The first exemption was the same as an exemption contained in the House\u00ad passed bill, covering material relat\u00ad ing to foreign intelligence or coun\u00ad terintelligence activities deSignated by the President. The second and third exemptions were new, and ap\u00ad plied as follows: (2) If such material is specifically exempt\u00ad ed from disclosure to the Comptroller General by statute provided that such statute [A] required that the material be withheld from the Comptroller General in such a manner as to leave no discretion on the issue, or [B] establishes partic\u00ad ular criteria for withholding from the Comptroller General or refers to particular types of matters to be withheld from the Comptroller General; or [3] If the President or the Director of the Office of Man\u00ad agement and Budget within 20 days after the filing of a report under subsection [b) [1], certi\u00ad fies in writing to the Comptrol\u00ad ler General, the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President of the Senate, that [A] such material consists of matters which can be with\u00ad held from disclosure under section 552[b][5] or 552[b][7], of title 5 United States Code and [B) the disclosure of such material to the Comptroller General could reasonably be expected to substantially im\u00ad pair the operations of the Fed\u00ad eral Government. Such certifi\u00ad cation shall be nondelegable by the President or by the Di\u00ad rector of the Office of Manage\u00ad ment and Budget and shall be accompanied by a full explana\u00ad tion of the rationale therefore. The second exemption represen\u00ad ted the heart of the compromise. It enabled the President or the Direc\u00ad tor of OMB to prevent GAO from going to court to get access to records that (A) could be withheld from the public under the Freedom of Information Act as either internal advice memoranda or law enforce\u00ad ment files if (B) the President or Director certified that giving GAO access \"cou Id reasonably be ex\u00ad pected to substantially impair the operations of the Federal Govern\u00ad ment.\" Senator Glenn proposed several other amendments to the Senate bill. One of these amendments allowed the President to exempt from section 101, unvouchered ex\u00ad penditure audits, transactions relat\u00ad ing to certain dOmestic law enforce\u00ad ment investigations. Another Glenn amendment required OMB to pro\u00ad duce a listing of unvouchered ex\u00ad penditure accounts. amend\u00ad ment limited the number of con\u00ad greSSional committees that could receive reports on GAO's unvouch- GAO Review/Summer 1980 ered expenditure audits. Lastly, Senator Glenn offered an amend\u00ad ment adding the House-passed language dealing with GAO draft reports, along with an additional provision requiring GAO to follow statutory and executive order guide\u00ad lines in its handling and storage of classified information in connec\u00ad tion with draft report procedures. The compromise language dis\u00ad cussed above, particularly the lan\u00ad guage dealing with access enforce\u00ad ment, proved to be acceptable to the executive branch. On February 8, 1980, the Senate bill was favorably reported with these amendments.45 After many long years, the end was now in sight. The full Senate passed S. 1878 on February 28, 1980.46 It then passed H. R. 24 after inserting the language of the Senate bill and sending H.R. 24 back to the House. On March 19, 1980, the House of Representatives concur\u00ad red in the Senate amendments to H.R. 24, thereby clearing the bill for the President. 47 President Carter signed H.R. 24 into law on April 3, 1980. Looking to the Future The General Accounting Office Act of 1980 was indeed a long time in the making. Will this protracted and difficult effort prove to be justi\u00ad fied? Senator Glenn thought so when he suggested during Senate consideration that \"[f] uture histor\u00ad ians may well look upon this peice of legislation as one of the most significant to emerge from the 96th Congress.\"48 GAO is now planning its ap\u00ad proach to the section 1 01 unvouch\u00ad ered expenditure audits, and proce\u00ad dures to implement the section 103 requirements for draft report com\u00ad ments are in effect. The section 104 procedures concerning the appoint\u00ad ment of the Comptroller and Deputy Comptroller General will be invoked very shortly. The title II inspector general provisions are self\u00ad executing. It is I ikely that the acid test for the General Accounting Office Act will come down to the effective\u00ad ness of its most controversial provisions-the section 102 access enforcement remedies. The impact of section 102 may be quite subtle; GAO Review / Stunll1er 1980 The General Accounting Office Act of 1980: The End of a Long Legislative Road in fact, this would be the preferable result. GAO officials have made clear throughout the course of the legislation that the judicial remed\u00ad ies should be invoked only as a last resort after reasonable efforts at accommodation have failed, and Congress has endorsed this ap\u00ad proach.49 The key benefits of section 102 should be to prevent many access disputes from ever arising and stimulating the prompt and informal resolution of those disputes which do arise. 59 The General Accounting Office Act of 1980: The End of a Long Legislative Road 1 Public Law 96-226, 94 Stat. 311. 2 16 Weekly Compilation of Presidential Documents 603. 3 Congo Rec. for February 28, 1980 (daily ed.), at S2062. 4 S.

GAO Review / Summer 1980 The Road to a Billion\u00ad Dollar Saving: A Team Effort $$$$$$$ In April 1976 the Air Force em\u00ad barked on the largest single compu\u00ad ter acquisition in Government his\u00ad tory. The project, called Phase IV, was to replace current computer systems at Air Force bases around the world at an estimated 20-year cost of $4 billion. Presently, most of the 118 Air Force bases located throughout the world have two computer systems, one for proces\u00ad sing supply applications and one for processing administrative appli\u00ad cations, such as finance and ac\u00ad counting, payroll, and personnel. The replacement plan would ex\u00ad change computers on a one-for-one basis. The Journey Be~in8 GAO's review, and later congres\u00ad sional interest, began in late 1978. Statutory survey of the use of func\u00ad tional specifications for computer acquisitions in the Government had uncovered the Phase IV project. At that time, the Air Force was seeking comments to its draft request for proposals from potential computer system bidders. The request was 1,300 pages long and had more than 400 pounds of supporting material accompanying it. The Boston staff's review of this material, along with the later release of an internal Air Force audit report critical to the proposal, caused GAO staff to discuss the computer acquisition with staff of the House Committee on Government Operations in mid\u00ad December 1978. Committee staff and GAO agreed that the Phase IV project should be reviewed and any possible procurement problems brought to the committee's atten\u00ad tion before the contract award, scheduled for mid-June 1979. This discussion, and vendor complaints to the committee, prompted committee Chairman Jack Brooks to formally ask GAO to review the Phase IV project. Speci\u00ad fically, the Chairman wanted GAO to determine why the Air Force needed to acquire two separate computer systems at each base, why few vendors participated in the competition, and how the Air Force handled unsolicited proposals made by an incumbent vendor before the request for proposals was issued. 61 The Road To A Billion Dollar Saving: A Team Effort Forming the Team During the job scoping process, we began developing criteria for selecting staff who could best respond to the committee's re\u00ad quest. Among the considerations was that staff would have to visit Air Force headquarters, major air commands, the Phase IV project manager's office, the computer acquisition center, and a represent\u00ad ative number of air bases, includ\u00ad ing a geographically remote loca\u00ad tion to represent foreign-based operations. With the criteria developed, the Financial and General Management Studies Division (FGMSD) selected the Atlanta, Dallas, Kansas City, (St. Louis), Seattle, and Washing\u00ad ton regional offices to join the team. By mid-April 1979, each of the regions had ADP-knowledge\u00ad able staff ready to start. The team held a job kickoff conference the second week of May, and the fol\u00ad lowing week the team members were off to all parts of the country. When fieldwork was completed 5 months later, the team had visited 14 air bases in 5 major air com\u00ad mands having installations in 12 States, from Alaska to Florida. The Team Effort A formal audit program was never written for the job because of the compressed timeframe involved. Instead, we used the committee letter and the Air Force response to its internal audit report as guides for our work. In addition, each audit staff developed a specific area of the audit and provided the other five sub-teams with audit questions to ask at their locations. For example, the Atlanta region concentrated on the facilities and personnel issues because much of the basic data was available at the project manager's office in the Atlanta region; Dallas and St. Louis developed issues stemming from their work at the major commands (SAC, MAC, and ATC); Seattle focused on the re\u00ad mote location and on questions concerning data processing during military buildups; and FGMSD and the Washington regional office con\u00ad centrated on the issues of restric\u00ad tive competition and unsolicited proposals, as well as Tactical Air 6~ Key team members from left to right: Steve Jue, Seattle; Curt Carter, Atlanta; Bill Bradley, FGMSD; Neal Seago, Young, St. Dave Dore, FGMSD. Other members John Mollet, Kansas City; Greg Symons, Kansas City; Edward Way tel, WRO; David Zugsberger, Anchorage. Command at Langley AFB, Va. This arrangement made frequent meetings and phone communica\u00ad tions mandatory. The team met almost monthly to exchange infor\u00ad mation and prepare for congres\u00ad sional briefings. Close communi\u00ad cations with the committee staff resulted in three briefings, held in June, July, and August. As the audit developed, some information needed from the Air Force became increasingly difficult to obtain. The general in charge of the Phase IV project openly labeled our review as unnecessary and a hindrance to completing the pro\u00ad ject. He began to require that our requests for information from the project manager's office be cleared with Air Force headquarters prior to releasing the information. In addi\u00ad t~on, project officials told us that some information was \"source se\u00ad lection senaitive,\" and because of the sensitivity they would not give us the information until it was first reviewed by Air Force headquarters. Later, they specifically refused access to key data. We told the committee about the difficulties we were experiencing in obtaining information. As a conse\u00ad quence, Chairman Brooks wrote a letter to the Air Force requesting that it cooperate more fully with our review. At one point, committee subpoenas were contemplated to obtain critical project information. The Air Force tactic delayed us at least 2 months in completing our site work. The Drive to the Finish Originally, we had planned to give a final briefing to the commit\u00ad tee in October 1979 and issue a report by the end of the year. How\u00ad ever, this plan was drastically changed because the Air Force re\u00ad fused to accept Chairman Brooks' June 1979 suggestion to delay accepting vendor offers until GAO could complete its review. The Air Force proceeded not only to accept bid proposals, but even began the formal process of evaluating the proposals. Therefore, the committee decided it was necessary to hold hearings on the Phase IV project to bring attention to the serious questions GAO Review/Summer 1980 being identified during the review. The committee alerted the team and told it that hearings could be held anytime, with GAO possibly having no more than 48 hours' advance notice. Because of the sudden change in reporting objectives and time schedule, the responsibilities for summarizing and developing reporting issues were divided among the team. Atlanta developed the facilities and personnel issues; Dallas and St. Louis developed the base and command summaries; Seattle developed the technical specifications issue and assisted FGMSD with the vendor concerns issue; and FGMSD concentrated on the equipment issue, the testimony statement, and the administrative details for issuing the product. Team members began putting to\u00ad gether their issue areas to develop a detai led document supporting the testimony statement. The committee finally set the hearing date for the first week of October, and all key team members migrated to Washington, D.C., to . complete the assignment. The days before the hearings were hectic. The team made many changes to the testimony statement and sup\u00ad porting document, verified calcula\u00ad tions and briefed the Comptroller General, the FGMSD division direc\u00ad tor, and other GAO personnel. Although they had worked on previous congreSSional request as\u00ad signments, most of the team mem\u00ad bers had never participated in hearings; therefore a lot of interest and nervous excitement existed. One team member said he was awakened early in the morning of the hearings by a voice asking him about \"those facilities.\" He jumped out of bed saying, \"What facilities?\" He calmed down when he realized he was dreaming. The hearings lasted 2 days with testimony being given by GAO, the Air Force, the General Services Administration, and the Department of Defense. Needless to say, there was considerable interest among computer industry personnel in the proceedings and findings present\u00ad ed, particularly those computer firms that had invested several million dollars to prepare bid pro\u00ad posals. We told the committee that we found I ittle justification for two GAO Review / Summer 1980 The Road To A Billion Dollar Saving: A Team Effort computer systems at most air bases. The Air Force had said that the demand to process classified information, the need for onsite backup, the need for increased processing during military build\u00ad ups, and the need for flexibility during the conversion were suffi\u00ad cient reasons to warrant two sys\u00ad tems. To the contrary, we found that the amount of classified pro\u00ad cessing was minimal and could be scheduled during weekends and slack periods; no Air Force require\u00ad ment for onsite backup existed and all bases had backup agreements with neighboring bases; Air Force personnel could prioritize their work during increased activity; and conversion to two systems would provide no more flexibility than to one. We found that the reasons most vendors cited for not bidding on the project were the unnecessary tech\u00ad nical restrictions specified in the request for proposals and the Air Force requirements for outdated technology. For example, our re\u00ad view identified that the incumbent was the only one of the major computer vendors that could meet the technical specifications for the video display units with an off-the\u00ad shelf unit. Also, the Air Force required equipment that either the industry no longer made or was obsolete. Overall, we bluntly recommended that the Air Force should cancel the Phase IV request for proposals and issue a new one to increase compe\u00ad tition and more accurately reflect actual system user needs. We estimated cost savings of between $663 million and $1 billion. The Air Force, of course, disputed our estimated cost savings as well as our recommendation. However, they did not offer the committee any further justification for the two\u00ad system Phase IV approach or the need to retain the restrictive techni\u00ad cal specifications in the request for proposals. The committee questioned GSA about its procurement oversight role and DOD about its policy and review procedures for proceSSing computer procurements. The com\u00ad mittee seemed less than satisfied with the answers it received from these agencies. Considering the magnitude of this project, the committee believed that GSA and DOD should have taken a more active role in the procurement process. At the conclusion of the hearings, Chairman Brooks and his staff personally thanked each team mem\u00ad ber for working on the job. Thinking the job was essentially finished, some team members returned to their respective locations that day, and others the following day. Later that week, the committee's staff director notified GAO that the Chairman wanted a written report within 10 days. All key staff members were recalled to Washing\u00ad ton, D.C. to complete and process the supporting statement and the report. The team members spent the next 10 days indexing, responding to review notes, meeting with GSA officials, reviewing testimony transcripts, preparing rebuttals to Air Force testimony, furnishing additional material to the commit\u00ad tee staff, and processi ng the report. The End of the Road The somewhat weary but satis\u00ad fied team completed its job when the report, titled \"The Air Force Should Cancel Plans To Acquire Two Computer Systems At Most Bases\" (FGMSD-80-15), was issued on October 26, 1979, 10 days after the committee's request. Several team members continued to work with GSA and the committee staff. On November 9, GSA suspended the Air Force's authority to acquire the Phase IV equipment pending completion of a GSA review, and on December 4 the committee issued its report, adopting all GAO recom\u00ad mendations. GSA completed its review on February 1, 1980, and issued a report agreeing with GAO that considerable savings could be realized from a redirection and recompetition of the Phase IV project. On March 28, 1980, the Secretary of the Air Force agreed to redirect the Phase IV project to satisfy the concerns of GAO and the commit\u00ad tee. Specifically, the Air Force will amend the request for proposals to reduce by 70 the proposed number of computers, eliminate 250 staff positions, reduce the need to construct or modify 16 facilities, improve current systems proces- 63 The Road To A Billion Dollar Saving: A Team Effort sing, and perform a functional analysis to better define its equip\u00ad ment requirements. The Air Force expects to achieve a cost savings of $800 million from these changes. In addition, the Air Force will redistrib\u00ad ute the amended request for pro\u00ad posals to all previously identified bidders to stimulate competition. From the initial review to the end, the team never waivered from its pOSition concerning the weakness\u00ad es of the Phase IV project. The enthusiasm and support among the GAO team members remained 64 strong, even though the concluding days found the team members in\u00ad dexing sections of the report they did not write and helping other team members complete their work. Although the team members spent a lot of time on the road and were under considerable ti me and sched\u00ad ule pressures, they held together. On January 21, 1980, Chairman Brooks wrote Mr. Staats, congratu\u00ad lating the staff for an outstanding job in highlighting ADP misman\u00ad agement. He added: This investigation confirms my belief that the GAO should encourage the development of ADP auditing expertise in the various divisions and regional offices. While the Federal Gov\u00ad ernment is becoming more and more dependent on the use of computers, the executive agen\u00ad cies are still paying little atten\u00ad tion to the management of these resources. You can be assured that this committee plans to continue its oversight in this area and will utilize the GAO in the future to assist in this endeavor. GAO Review/Summer 1980 Jimmy R.

He has a B.S. degree in production management from Troy State University (AL) and an M.B.A. from the University of Mississippi. He also attended the GAO\u00ad Wharton program. Mr. Sheely has extensive experience in auditing ADP systems and in system development activities, and has been recognized by the EDP Auditors Foun\u00ad dation as a certified data processing auditor. GAO Review/Summer 1980 A Strueture For Managing ADP Resonrees' Despite increased attention in re\u00ad cent years, automatic data process\u00ad ing activities still present major management problems. These problems have resulted in part from the lack of an appropriate organiza\u00ad tional structure and procedures for managing ADP activities. Top man\u00ad agement generally does not con\u00ad sider information systems as a corporate asset, and therefore does not devote enough attention to managing them as a discrete entity. Data processing activities are too easily categorized as part of other organizational functions. Purchas\u00ad ing applications are handled in the purchasing department, accounting applications in the controller's de\u00ad partment, and other applications by other individual line organizations. Recent GAO reviews, however, suggest that with the development of large, integrated ADP informa\u00ad tion systems, this operating pattern is changing, and the emerging pattern points to a need for more centralized organization of ADP activities. During a recent GAO review, we observed one organization in the process of changing from a largely decentral ized management struc\u00ad ture to one with more centralized management planning, control, and review of ADP activities. The exper\u00ad ience of this agency illustrates the new management structure and processes likely to result from such a tranSition. Other reviews have reported similar changes underway in other Federal agencies. This agency uses ADP resources extensively. In fiscal year 1978, the value of its ADP capital equipment exceeded $10 million, and it had plans to invest an additional $50 million in new equipment over the next 6 years. The agency spent about $25 million to develop, main\u00ad tain, and operate its computer applications during fiscal year 1978 and projected a 60 percent increase in these annual operating expenses in 1980. Before the agency decided to centralize ADP functions, re-sponsibility for managing its ADP resources was fragmented among many offices and divisions. Only acquisition and operation of com\u00ad puter equipment were centralized; 56 separate development groups handled system planning, develop\u00ad ment, and implementation. The lack of centralized manage\u00ad ment was most evident in the agency's piecemeal approach to planning system development. Each of the more than 50 separate development groups developed its own program, and the resulting ADP systems were designed only to accomplish specific tasks in sup\u00ad port of an individual group's man\u00ad agement responsibilities. Such an approach did little to minimize duplication among data bases or to ensure that applications were adaptable to the needs of multiple users. However, Federal agencies are clearly obligated to manage ADP resources efficiently. Office of Man\u00ad agement and Budget Circular A-71 assigns to agency heads the author\u00ad ity and responsibility for effective and efficient management ()f their ADP activities, including planning, coordinating, and controlling use of these resources. Trade literature also emphasizes ADP planning, especially given the age and condi\u00ad tion of many computer systems; the vastly increased time, cost, and resource requirements of modern real-time, data-base projects; and the uncertain effect of new technol\u00ad ogy. Planning Effective ADP planning depends on how an agency organizes to accomplish the planning function and how it assigns the responsi\u00ad bilities for planning. A decentral\u00ad ized organization usually requires a strong central office with responsi\u00ad bility and authority for directing, controlling, and reviewing ADP planning. Such an office will func- 65 A Structure For Managing ADP Resources tion best if it has top management involvement and commitment. This support often takes the form of an executive management, ADP\u00ad steering committee, which includes representation from user manage\u00ad ment. The committee reviews and approves all major ADP decisions and prepares short-(1-year) and long-(5 year) range ADP plans an\u00ad nually. Overall, these plans document executive management's decision to acquire and use ADP resources to achieve the organization's objec\u00ad tives. Specifically, the plans iden\u00ad tify the agency's ADP objectives and strategy and set policies and procedures for acquiring and using ADP resources. The ADP plans should also serve as a foundation document for controlling and eval\u00ad uating the effectiveness of ADP activities and system development projects. Elements 01 A Plan Unfortunately, little guidance is available on the structure and content of a good ADP plan. We believe that, at a minimum, a good plan will contain the following elements: A clear statement of short\u00ad and long-term ADP objectives. This is a formal statement of what information systems the ADP steer\u00ad ing committee believes the agency and its components will need over the next 3 to 5 years, an assess\u00ad ment of how well existing and planned systems meet the identi- . fied needs, and an outline of each project identified for development. A concise, well-documented statement of existing and future requirements for computer support. This will require a complete, accur\u00ad ate inventory of current and planned applications, identification of mis\u00ad sion-essential applications, and ranking of incremental resource demands for non-miss ion-essential applications. It also entails: esti\u00ad mating how much computer and commun ications capacity is re\u00ad quired to support the applications identified; determining how the capacity will be deployed; i.e., among central systems, minicom\u00ad puters, and remote terminals; and outlining the communications net- 66 work necessary to link the capacity together. A sound, management\u00b7 endorsed strategy for achieving the agency's ADP objectives. This statement should identify, develop, and analyze each technical and economic alternative for meeting total application support require\u00ad ments effectively, efficiently, and econom ically. The decision to develop an ADP system is an investment decision and, once made, the success or failure of the system is highly de\u00ad pendent on the adequacy of man\u00ad agement's control over system de\u00ad velopment activities. A truly suc\u00ad cessful system is one which fulfills the user's requirements with a minimum investment of time, money, and effort. A sound ADP plan and appropriate management controls are essential to its suc\u00ad cess. Controlling The agency we reviewed had not implemented the management con\u00ad trols necessary to ensure that its ADP resources were being managed in the most effective manner. We found that its policies and proce\u00ad dures for system development, including its project authorization process and standard project man\u00ad agement system, had been neither fully nor uniformly implemented. Also lacking were uniform financial and estimating controls. Without management controls, the agency could not effectively allocate its ADP resources among the many competing ADP activities of its various independent components. While many types of manage\u00ad ment controls can be applied, three are basic: a project authorization process, a standard approach to managing the project, and a uni\u00ad form financial and estimating sys\u00ad tem. Projeet Authorization The initial project authorization process is an important aspect of managing and controlling systems development activities. Without the specific review and approval from top management this process pro-vides, developers and users of sys\u00ad tems can undertake activities which are too expensive to develop or operate or not in the agency's best interest. For example, in the agency we reviewed, management regula\u00ad tions required approval from the agency head for development pro\u00ad jects costing more than $100,000, but we noted many examples of inconsistent interpretation and ap\u00ad plication of this regulation. The need for top management review and approval of system development projects is illustrated by one organization's automated correspondence index system. This system, which duplicated a similar system being developed in another organization, had not received re\u00ad view and approval from top man\u00ad agement, even though costs to develop it exceeded $330,000. Oper\u00ad ating costs for the system exceeded $248,000 the first year and are projected to exceed $350,000 in the short-term future. Recently, a man\u00ad agement consultant firm reported that the system is probably not cost effective. Standard Projeet Management A standard management ap\u00ad proach is generally recognized as desirable and useful in ensuring development of a successful sys\u00ad tem. The process or content of standard project management has never been fully defined. However, industries involved in development activities-construction and aero\u00ad space, for example-have devel\u00ad oped mature project management systems. Conceptually, these in\u00ad dustries segment the development efforts into six phases-planning, definition, design, construction, test, and implementation. This phasing divides the overall work into a logical, systematic sequence of smaller, manageable tasks. Un\u00ad der th is approach, each phase must be successfully completed, re\u00ad viewed, and approved before any work is started on the next phase. In addition to organizing the development activities into phases, a standard project management system requires the user, designer, and management to document pro\u00ad ject objectives, the quality and quantity of resources needed, and the target completion dates for GAO Review / Summer 1980 each phase. This documentation helps management review and con\u00ad trol each phase of the system development project. Finaneial and Estimating Controls One of management's most use\u00ad ful tools for monitoring the develop\u00ad ment process is comparing actual costs and benefits with estimated costs and benefits-ideally by task or phase. While acomplete account\u00ad ing system for ADP may not al\u00ad ways be feasible, a system which records each project's development and operating costs is feasible if the development project uses an organized project approach. This system should provide reports in a timely, systematic manner and show actual versus planned costs for each phase, taSk, and function of the project's development. Such a format enables management to evaluate progress and performance and to decide whether system benefits still warrant continued development efforts. It also encour\u00ad ages cost consciousness on the part of management, users, and developers. Reviewing The advantages of an effective ADP audit group have been widely documented; as with a good ADP plan and adequate controls, such a group can help ensure the success of an ADP system. To function effectively, it needs sufficient re\u00ad sources, necessary skills, and ade\u00ad quate authority. Although agency management generally recognizes ADP auditing as an important tool for monitoring and controll ing operations, GAO continues to identify many exam\u00ad ples of a lack of management atten\u00ad tion to this function. For example, despite the large expenditures and widespread use of computers in the agency we reviewed, coverage of ADP activities by the internal audit group was extremely limited. Only two auditors were assigned full\u00ad time responsibility for ADP audits and the agency did not have an approved functional mission state\u00ad ment or job description for this group. As a consequence, some operating divisions questioned the GAO Review / Summer 1980 group's authority to audit their ac\u00ad tivities. Such an attitude is probably not uncommon in other decentral\u00ad ized organizations or agencies. The question of authority is closely related to organizational placement of the ADP audit group. In the agency we reviewed, it was located in the Comptroller's office, which may be typical in most Federal organizations. While organizational placement may vary according to the needs of the agency, the ADP audit group should report to a level high enough in the organization so that its function is perceived by other offices as important, ensuring that action is taken on recommenda\u00ad tions made in its reports. Wherever located, all operating divisions must recognize that the ADP audit group's authority and responsibility are not limited to audits of financial operations. In March 1979, GAO published supplemental audit standards to provide guidance for auditors in\u00ad volved in ADP audit work.' These A Structure For Managing ADP Resources standards should serve to enligi1ten management regarding the expan\u00ad ded role of the ADP auditor. Why Do This? ADP resources are costly and often have great effect on many aspects of an organization's work. Effectively managing them is chal\u00ad lenging in any organizational set\u00ad ting, and a decentralized approach to the task-decisionmaking as\u00ad signed to several offices or divi\u00ad sions-complicates management's job immensely. Trade literature on the subject and experience in managing ADP resources indicate the advantages of adopting the organizational structure and pro\u00ad cedures discussed in this article. A sound ADP plan, adequate con\u00ad trols, and an effective review pro\u00ad cess-given strong support and involvement from top manage\u00ad ment-can increase efficiency and enhance benefits available from this valuable resource. 1 Additional GAO Audit Standards: Auditing Computer-Based Systems. Foreword dated March 1979. This document is available through GAO Distribution. 67 William F. Mayo Mr. Mayo, a supervisory management auditor in the Atlanta regional office, joined GAO in May 1969. He graduated from the University of Georgia with a B.B.A. degree in economics and government and is a member of the Association of Government Accountants. 68 Playing on SODleone Else '8 TeaDl; or Working on a Senate Subeommittee Soon after joining GAO in 1969, I learned that working directly for a congressional committee is some\u00ad thing many GAO auditors hope to be able to do at some point during their careers. In the Atlanta regional office (ARO), GAO veterans often regaled us with \"war stories\" about their experiences working directly for investigative committees, and the work they described seemed mysterious, exciting and possibly career-enhancing. The power and prestige of committee staff mem\u00ad bers are considerable. When de\u00ad tailed to a committee, a GAO auditor becomes an official member of the committee staff; takes orders from the com\u00ad mittee, not GAO; and can dispense with much of the bureaucratic maze and paperwork that can accom\u00ad pany an audit. Eager young auditor that I was, I too acquired the dream and placed it in the back of my mind, where it stayed for almost 9 years. In fact, I had long since forgotten about the dream when, in 1978, the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Inves\u00ad tigations of the Committee on Governmental Affairs decided to bring its investigations to Atlanta. Foeus on the Federal Penitentiar)' During one 20-month period (September 1976 through April 1978), the Atlanta Penitentiary had undergone an unprecedented and alarming rash of 11 inmate mur\u00ad ders-half of the total number of inmate homicides that had occurred during the preceding 10 years. Moreover, in testimony before the subcommittee, a former inmate had plleged that \"the Penitentiary is run like a country club\"; inmates were free to roam, he said, had easy access to weapons, and faced no detriment to criminal behavior with\u00ad in the institution. \"Everyone is armed there,\" he added, \"except the guards.\" Little wonder that sub\u00ad committee investigators were en\u00ad route to Atlanta. I had returned from a field trip to Providence, R.I., and was expecting to spend a routine Friday writing a progress report when word reached me that the subcommittee had re\u00ad quested the Comptroller General to detail three \"good\" GAO auditors to it for about 2 weeks. According to the assistant manager who brought me the news, a distinct possibility existed that I would be one of the fortunate three. Even so, I did not get too excited. In the past, promises of great assignments had not materialized, and the assistant manager had only his record of a phone call to back up this one. Nonetheless, the assignment did come through a few days later. The subcommittee simply said that the investigation would involve \"allega\u00ad tions of corruption and improprie\u00ad ties at the Atlanta Penitentiary.\" When I contacted one of the subcommittee team members to find out what advance preparations would be necessary, I had visions of having to get guns, badges, 2-way radios, etc., but what did he in fact ask for? One large confer\u00ad ence room, a typewriter, and a calculator. Strange tools, I thought, for investigating corruption and improprieties in high places. The specific allegations under investi\u00ad gation, I had learned, were that corrupt prison employees had smuggled dope to in\u00ad mates; inmates in Atlanta had been murdered because of lax security, widespread weapon and drug availability, and organized crime influence; GAO Review / Summer 1980 employees had converted Government property to per\u00ad sonal use; construct ion I maintenance funds and materials had been misappropriated and diverted to unauthorized pur\u00ad poses; and cases of medical malpractice had occurred. The Subeommittee Team The Investigations Subcommittee staffed this particular assignment similarly to the way in which GAO staffs its teams. The chart below lists the Senate Subcommittee team members and their GAO counterparts. Senate Subcommittee Subcommittee Chairman (U.S. Senator) Chief Counsel assistant Chief Counsel Chief Criminal Investigator Special Investigator (Criminal) Chief Financial Investigator Three Investigators (Financial)* GAO Division Director Team Director Team Leader Sub-team Leader Team member Sub-team Leader Team members *Three GAO staff, grades 14, 12, and 9. The Assistant Chief Counsel directed the entire investigation and, through the two chief investi\u00ad gators, managed the team's day-to\u00ad day activities. In the beginning, he reported to the Chief Counsel but later, as time became more critical and the findings more substantial, he reported directly to the subcom\u00ad mittee Chairman. The Assistant Chief Counsel was an attorney with substantial experience in criminal prosecutions. The Chief Criminal Investigator had several years ex\u00ad perience as a investigator for the National Park Service, and his assistant (Special Criminal Investi\u00ad gator) was a former long-time crackerjack detective with the New York police department. During his 20-year career as a detective, the Special Criminal Investigator had, among other things, been beaten GAO Review/Summer 1980 Playing On Someone Else's Team; or Working On A Senate Subcommittee up and threatened by the Mafia and once, as police chief, had arrested an entire city council on corruption charges. Most of the council mem\u00ad bers were indicted. As we later learned, he was also a superb criminal interrogator. The Chief Financial Investigator, a former investigative reporter for some prominent newspapers, had a background in law, journalism, and business. As investigators for the subcommittee, the GAO staff re\u00ad ported to the Chief Financial In\u00ad vestigator and worked directly un\u00ad der his control and supervision. We examined the more critical issues concerning property misuse and misappropriation of funds. The criminal investigators, on the other hand, focused on employee corrup\u00ad tion, drug smuggling, inmate mur\u00ad ders, weapon availability, and other such mundane matters. With team members from diverse backgrounds and disciplines, the subcommittee was able to draw upon a storehouse of information in condUcting its investigation, an advantage that contributed signifi\u00ad cantly to the success of its efforts. Its members had backgrounds, education, and experience in areas such as political SCience, law, law enforcement, corrections, journal\u00ad ism, economics, accounting, audit\u00ad ing, government operations, per\u00ad sonnel management, financial man\u00ad agement, budgeting, and building construction. The Investigation On August 28,1978 at 10:00 a.m., the investigation actually got under\u00ad way. As requested, I had reserved the regional office conference room and obtained the typewriter and cal\u00ad culator. The subcommittee staff arrived at about 10:15 a. m. but, much to my surprise and disap\u00ad pointment, without trench coats, dark sunglasses, Kojak hats, and shoulder holsters. They all wore conservative three-piece suits and carried briefcases. The only weap\u00ad ons they carried were tape recor\u00ad ders. After formal introductions and greetings, the team leader briefed us on the investigation and our role. It was obvious from the start that the subcommittee staff had gradu\u00ad ated from Dale Carnegie Tech-they easily felt at home, quickly took charge, had superb interper\u00ad sonal communication skills, and probably could have developed rap\u00ad port with their toughest opponents. Our first task was to deliver letters which the permanent sub\u00ad committee Chairman had written to the local Bureau of Prison officials. The letters requested that the Bureau turn over certain records and documents to the subcommit\u00ad tee staff by a specified time. Just in case Bureau officials did not co\u00ad operate, we had subpoenas sec\u00ad reted in our coat pockets. However, Bureau officials did comply and by noon of the next day, the subcom\u00ad mittee had impounded in the GAO conference room two truckloads of records and documents covering activities of 4 fiscal years at the Atlanta Penitentiary. Included were 26 boxes of data, 6 full file cabinets, 8 volumes of Bureau regulations, and numerous compu\u00ad ter printouts. Somehow, the local newspapers found out that the subcommittees had impounded volumes of Bureau records and was keeping them in vacant offices at GAO. A newspaper article in the August 31 edition described almost exactly the rec\u00ad ords we had. This was not the last we were to hear from the media. After dividing into two teams\u00ad criminal and financial-the sub\u00ad committee staff continued its in\u00ad vestigation. With our lightning-fast GAO reasoning skills, we GAO members soon figured out which team was going to examine the mountain of records stockpiled in the GAO conference room. During the next 2 weeks, besides poring through reams of purchase re\u00ad quests, purchase orders, receiving reports, invoices, payment vouch\u00ad ers, blueprints, drawings, progress reports, cost estimates, payroll time sheets, and numerous other documents, we also \"interrogated\" former and current Atlanta Peni\u00ad tentiary inmates and employees. Normal 8-hour days grew slowly to 10, 12, and 16 hours. On four occasions, the subcommittee worked around the clock, but event\u00ad ually we got our payoff-by the end of the second week, we knew the investigation would prove success\u00ad ful. By Friday, September 8, the 69 Playing On Someone Else's Team; or Working On A Senate Subcommittee subcommittee staff had prepared a rough draft of findings and, over the weekend, delivered it to the sub\u00ad committee Chairman in Washing\u00ad ton, D.C. The team leader returned on Monday and informed us that the subcommittee had decided the evidence gathered to date was \"sufficient to fly\" and the investiga\u00ad tion would continue. The subcom\u00ad mittee set September 29 and Octo\u00ad ber 2 as dates for the hearings in Atlanta. Our remaining tasks in\u00ad cluded preparing a final report on Penitentiary financial mismanage\u00ad ment, firming up the evidence, and drafting statements for the hear\u00ad ings. During the investigation, the U.S. Marshal's Service assisted the sub\u00ad committee staff by escorting in\u00ad mates to our office for interroga\u00ad tion, by guardingbuildTngentrances and exits to prevent escapes, and by warding off nosy reporters. During lunch one day, we left an inmate informant locked up in\u00ad side the conference room. A U.S. Marshal guarded the conference room doors and, as if to demon\u00ad strate the effectiveness of the Atlanta Penitentiary rehabilitation program, the inmate stole my candy bar. My sUb-team leader advised me not to file charges. About midpoint during the inves\u00ad tigation, we received an anonymous letter addressed to the subcommit\u00ad tee. It alleged that a particular Penitentiary employee had ques\u00ad tionable sexual traits, conspired with inmates, and, over several years, had stolen government prop\u00ad erty. This letter cost us 2 days' work in checking out the character, history, and property owned by the accused employee. None of the allegations proved true, nor did we ever find out who wrote the letter. Talk about timing-as the staff was drafting hearing statements on causes for inmate murders at the Pen, a local Atlanta TV reporter called us at about 1 :30 p.m. on September21. He asked we could give him some information about the inmate who had just been murdered at 12:25 p.m. We didn't want him to know that we were un\u00ad aware of the murder (after all, wasn't the subcommittee investi': gating inmate murders?), so we said that the subcommittee could not give out any information at this 70 time. We then immediately hung up the phone and made a mad dash to the Penitentiary, where we learned that another inmate had indeed been stabbed to death with a homemade spoon knife-allegedly either over drugs or homosexual activities .. FBI agents were already at the scene, of course, and seemed to have the situation well in hand; they did not appear to need our help. So back we went to writing statements for the hearings, but now we had a new paragraph to add. A few days later, at about mid\u00ad night on Saturday, September 23, the team leader and sUb-team leaders met at the Atlanta airport with the subcommittee Chairman. They decided that the evidence on employee corruption, dope smug~ gling, and inmate murders was so overwhelming that they would fo\u00ad cus the hearings primarily on these allegations. The Hearings The subcommittee held 2 full days of hearings on corruption at the Atlanta Penitentiary. The hear\u00ad ing room at the Federal courthouse was packed both days. All three national TV networks sent repor\u00ad ters, as did local TV and radio stations and newspapers. In addi\u00ad tion, Penitentiary and Bureau em\u00ad ployees, interested citizens and students, and certain GAO family members, associates, and friends also attended. tion. A third employee testified with immunity and admitted taking large amounts of money into the Peniten\u00ad tiary and giving it to inmates sus\u00ad pected of being in the narcotics business. Another employee, who had recently resigned, admitted in a sworn statement that he received gratuities from inmates. During the investigation and hearings, the subcommittee solved two inmate murders. Two Peniten\u00ad tiary inmates came forward \"volun\u00ad tarily\" and testified that they wit\u00ad nessed the brutal murders of two inmates who were known drug dealers. One of the murdered inmates had been part of the famous \"French Connection\" case. Trials concerning these murders were completed in December 1979, resulting in dismissal of the indict\u00ad ment in one murder, and two con\u00ad victions and one acquittal in the second. On the second day of hearings, GAO members of the subcommittee staff testified that no evidence was found concerning employees con\u00ad verting government property to personal use. However, we did state that conditions and contro~ over property, materials, and equip\u00ad ment were such that conversion might easily occur. In addition, we noted that the subcommittee found substantial flaws in the Peniten\u00ad tiary'sconsfflidio-nan-a-maTnTe-\u00ad nance management systems that allowed prison officials to divert, misallocate, and misuse funds and materials for purposes not intended by the Bureau or the Congress. One case showed that Penitentiary man\u00ad agers had diverted over $50,000 of routine maintenance funds to office and residence renovations for them\u00ad selves. In doing so, they ignored a previously establ ished and ap\u00ad proved maintenance priority list. Overall, the subcommittee con\u00ad cluded that neither the Congress nor the Bureau had any assurance that funds provided the Atlanta Penitentiary had not resulted in waste, loss, or extravagance. The subcommittee Chairman later re\u00ad quested that GAO do a full-scale review of Bureau of Prisons man\u00ad agement practices. The Subcommittee heard testi\u00ad mony from three Atlanta Peniten\u00ad tiary inmates, two former em\u00ad ployees, two current employees, subcommittee staff, the Atlanta Penitentiary warden, and the South\u00ad east Director of the Bureau of Prisons. Three inmates not only admitted their involvement in drug trafficking within the Penitentiary but also named two employees who brought contraband to them. One of the employees invoked the fifth amendment and chose not to answer subcommittee questions; this employee was later indicted, convicted, and sentenced to 3 years in a Federal prison. The second employee denied charges and was never indicted because of insuffic- The Results ient evidence.

Evi- GAO Review / Summer 1980 dence presented at the hearings substantiated the allegations con\u00ad cerning inmate security, weapons availability, employee corruption, and property and financial manage\u00ad ment. One employee has been dis\u00ad missed since then for dealing in contraband drugs within the prison and is awaiting prosecution. Two inmates have been murdered since September 1978, and in November 1979-just before the Thanksgiving holidays-an inmate brutally mur\u00ad dered a female dietetic consultant GAO Review / Summer 1980 Playing On Someone Else's Team; or Working On A Senate Subcommittee who worked part-time in the prison hospital. According to newspaper accounts, this was the first time in over 50 years that a non-inmate had been killed in the Penitentiary. The inmate suspect was found guilty and sentenced to a second life term. Bureau of Prisons officials testi\u00ad fied at our hearings that they planned to close the Atlanta Peni\u00ad tentiary by at least 1985. The A.ftermath Five weeks as part of the Per-manent Subcommittee staff defi\u00ad nitely lived up to my expectations. The experience provided firsthand knowledge of and insight into the actual decisionmaking process and inner workings of the Congress and its committees. The whole affair left me feeling exhausted, but also gave me a sense of pride in our system of government. It is satis\u00ad fying to know that in the govern\u00ad ment's vast bureaucracies, a team of \"experts\" can quickly be assem\u00ad bled to ferret out waste, inefficien\u00ad cy, corruption, and fraud. 71 William J. Schad Mr. Schad is an assistant regional manager, GAO Chicago regional office. He previously served asan audit manager with the Cincinnati regional office. Mr. Schad is a member and past president, Chicago chapter, Association of Govern\u00ad ment Accountants, a certified professional manager, and the principal moderator for Midwestern Forum activities. As chairper\u00ad son of the Midwestern Intergovernmental Audit Forum, Mr. Schad managed the forming and testing of the peer quality system and the reviews, and is the principal author of the publication, A System for Peer Quality Assessment of Government Audit Agencies. Who Audits the Auditors? The title question is, quite legiti\u00ad mately, often posed by those subject to the eyes and ears of auditors. Agencies spend about $1 billion every year to conduct inter\u00ad nal audits of agency management and external audits of grantees and contractors. So that this spending may result in improved program operations, audit organizations need periodic evaluation to ensure the quality of their audits. Periodic evaluation is important, not only to maintain audit quality, but to maintain confidence in that quality among program managers. legislators, and other audit groups. Auditors need each other's confi\u00ad dence to avoid unnecessary repeti\u00ad tive audits of the same agency, contractor, or grantee-as called for by Office of Management and Budget Circular A-102. They need legislators' confidence to avoid the budget cutter's scissors. Most of all, they need the confidence of program managers, who must act on their audit findings. Equally essential is their credibility in the eyes of the taxpayers, whose faith in government depends partly on them. An Answer In May 1978, members of the Midwestern I ntergovernmental Au\u00ad dit Forum met to discuss the question of who should audit the auditors. Its conclusion? Other auditors. The forum set out to devise a peer assessment system. First, we drafted an evaluation guide consis\u00ad tent with audit standards of the Comptroller General and the Ameri\u00ad can Institute of Certified Public Accountants. The gu ide included various evaluation standards for the auditing organization to meet, ac\u00ad companied by \"aids,\" or criteria, to help a review team assess compli\u00ad ance. This guide was then sent to forum members for comment. Af\u00ad firming their support for the project, 10 agency directors offered their organizations as guinea pigs and nearly 50 audit supervisors and managers volunteered for test re\u00ad view teams. Testing the Answer The forum established a commit\u00ad tee to fashion questionnaires, de\u00ad sign a scoring system, and manage the reviews. The committee chose one agency at each level-Federal, State, and local-and choose five\u00ad member teams for each review. Team members represented three Federal Inspector General Offices, the General Accounting Office, and three State and two local govern\u00ad ment audit agencies. During a forum meeting following the tests, panels of team leaders and organization directors candidly described their review experiences. We learned that the tests fostered a fuller understanding of the system among forum members, the com\u00ad mittee, review teams, and agency officials. Also significant was the bonus to the agencies-profes\u00ad sional interchange and advice on how policies, procedures, and audit work could be improved. For our part, the improvements needed were a clear distinction between evaluation standards and aids, a clear reporting format and coherence among the various instruments, and a clear way to decide on compliance with evaluation standards. Revising the Answer To make the improvements, the forum's Executive Administrator and the committee chairperson subjected each standard, aid, and questionnaire statement, line by line, to a seemingly endless list of suggestions and critiques from committee members, team mem\u00ad bers, and agency directors. While the process took several months and was sometimes discouraging, we made progress and our concern turned again to enthusiastic opti\u00ad mism. GAO Review/Summer 1980 Still the task of revision was not yet finished. The draft went to the committee, where a great deal of thought went into polishing the eval uation standards and instru\u00ad ments. The committee presented the results to the forum. After considerable discussion and some changes to the review instruments, the forum adopted the peer quality assessment system. Publieizing the Answer While refining the system, we spread the word that an answer was on the way. The committee chair\u00ad person spoke at meetings and con\u00ad ferences of the Municipal Finance Officers Association, the Associa\u00ad tion of Government Accountants, and the National Intergovernmental Audit Forum. He participated in a seminar sponsored by the Joint Conference of the National Forum, and is expected to participate in meetings of other professional organizations in the next several months. In December 1979, the forum published A System for Peer Quality Assessments of Government Audit Agencies. We distributed copies to the National Forum executives and chairpersons, State and local gov\u00ad ernments, professional organJza\u00ad tions, and national and interna\u00ad tional special interest groups. To date, over 900 copies have been dis\u00ad tributed. The System in Brief In its present form the system includes an overview of the project, a guide containing 52 evalu\u00ad ation standards and 129 aids, bylaws for a managing com\u00ad mittee, a scoring and compliance scheme, a report format, a typical engagement letter contracting for the assess\u00ad ment, a review team applicant questionnaire, and questionnaire and related GAO Review / Summer 1980 transm ittal letters for aud it staff, report users, and au\u00ad ditees. The guide has 10 major descrip\u00ad tive chapters: organizational plan\u00ad ning and controls, independence, qualifications, supervision, work\u00ad papers, legal and regulatory re\u00ad quirements, internal control, finan\u00ad cial audit reports, reporting proce\u00ad dures, and external auditors. Each chapter includes a broad concept statement followed by evaluation standards and aids. Evaluation standards are geared toward assessing compliance with policies and procedures that ought to be present in agency's operations and toward assessing the agency's financial and compliance work. Standards help the team determine whether poliCies and procedures are comprehensive and suitably de\u00ad lineated, documented, and com\u00ad municated. The review team deter\u00ad mines compliance by reviewing documents, interviewing manage\u00ad ment and staff, analyzing question\u00ad naires, and observing practices. Costs and Benefits Test reviews show that a typical onsite peer quality assessment takes about 2 weeks. Staff orienta\u00ad tion and preparation, onsite audit review, report preparation, and overall team leader responsibilities represent an investment of roughly 100 staff days by the audit com\u00ad munity for the professional better\u00ad ment of one of its members. Organizations contributing resour\u00ad ces can expect reciprocal assess\u00ad ment services. The Future Our work is just beginning. The Committee on Peer Quality Assess\u00ad ment met in February 1980, and agreed on a timetable and strategy for assessing other forum members' audit organizations. At that time, seven agencies at various levels of government asked for an assess\u00ad ment review. Supervisory staff from our member organizations, all with their directors' recommendations, volunteered for review teams. We have furnished draft guide\u00ad lines and related system material to the National Intergovernmental Au-Who Audits the Auditors? dit Forum's Committee on Quality Review. That committee's chairper\u00ad son and project director have organized.a mechanism to form a national quality assessment sys\u00ad tem. We intend to cooperate in that endeavor. In the meantime, we expect to learn a great deal more in applying the system and will revise it, and the companion publication, as appropriate. The Essential Ingredient Members of the audit community at all levels cooperated to an unpre\u00ad cedented degree in the peer assess\u00ad ment project. The cooperation led to improved intergovernmental un\u00ad derstanding. Such cooperation and understanding are as essential to the system's continued success as they were to its development. 73 Who Audits the Auditors? How the Peer Quality Assessment System Works A committee, review teams, and assessment instruments are not enough to make the system operational. A unified system needs a method and a timetable for planning and doing reviews. The following chronology traces the Midwestern Forum's timetable from the engagement agreement to the issued report. Description Elapsed Calendar Timeframe in Weeks Committee sends engagement agreement to audit agency for director's approval and signature. Committee sends inquiry to audit agency to elicit representations on policies, procedures, and operations. Committee receives signed engagement agreement from agency. From a pool of volunteers, committee selects a five-person team of Federal, State, and local auditors with managerial/supervisory experience to conduct the onsite review. Audit agency supplies committee with representations on policies, procedures, and operations. Committee sends questionnaires to agency staff, report users, and auditees to obtain their views on policies, procedures, and operations. Committee reviews responses to questionnaires and sends followup request let\u00ad ters as needed. Committee completes questionnaire summaries and provides review team with results of questionnaires.

GAO Review/Summer 1980 Alternative Mortgage Instruments -Their Importanee To YOft Most of us have heard the saying, \"A man's home is his castle.\" This brings visions of a beautiful rock fortress on a lonely hilltop. The neighbors are too far away to cause you any concern, and you have all the space/ rooms you could ever want. However, in today's world the castle is I ikely to be a 1600-2200 square foot house located in a city or subdivision. It is surrounded by other homes that are basically the same as the one you are living in. Unlike the lord of the castle, who owns his castle outright, most of us will have a mortgage to pay. A mortgage, according to Webster, is \"the pledging of property to a cred itor as security for the payment of a debt.\" This definition contains no reference to an interest rate to pay on the loan, the size of the loan in relation to a person's income, the length of time in which repayment can be made, or what happens in the event that a payment isn't made. Yet all of these elements are contained in a mortgage. Some of you are now saying, \"So what! Tell me something I don't know.\" OK, do you know that the types of mortgage instruments used in home purchases are chang\u00ad ing? Do you know why they are changing? Do you know what effect these changes will have on you when you sell a house, buy a house, or try to change the financ\u00ad ing on a current house? If you know the answers, don't read this article. If you don't know all the answers, let me share a few ideas with you. This discussion is based on a current GAO-HUD audit effort, planned for issue in December 1980. That report will contain a broader presentation of the useful\u00ad ness of alternative mortgage instru\u00ad ments. It will also contain a dis\u00ad cussion on how these instruments have actually worked in the market\u00ad place. Mortgage Doeument Most people probably don't real-ize that the mortgage instrument they are fam i I iar with is less than 40 years old. In the 1930's, a home purchase could require a 50 to 70 percent down payment with the remaining loan for a 1 to 5 year period. During this period, only interest was paid. No amortizations occurred and the buyer paid all principal at the end of the term, in a \"balloon\" payment. How many of us could purchase under those terms? The Federal Government, through the use of the Federal Housing Administration, pioneered the fully amortized low down payment which required 5 to 25 percent down and 20 to 30 years to pay. These loans proved to be a good investment for mortgage investors in the 1940's. This instrument became known as the standard, fixed-rate, level pay\u00ad ment mortgage instrument which is still widely in use. We will be discussing several dif\u00ad ferent mortgage instruments, using a sample house (valued at $66,000) and at a starti ng interest rate of 13 percent. Standard Mortgage An item used as a standard must contain certain characteristics, such as a total dominance of the field. It provides a needed service to al/ those who use it. Yet circum\u00ad stances will occur causing a stan\u00ad dard to fall and a new standard to arise. Simply put, the need for alternative mortgage instruments (AMI's) stems directly from the in\u00ad creaSingly recognized inadequacies of the standard fixed payment mort\u00ad gage (SFPM). The standard instru\u00ad ment was designed to operate in a relatively stable economic and fi\u00ad nancial environment. However, since the mid-1960's, the American economy has been characterized by periods of high and/or rising inter\u00ad est rates induced by rapid inflation and restrictive credit policies. In the face of such economic conditions, the lack of payment flexibility in- 75 Alternative Mortgage Instruments-Their Importance To You herent in the SFPM affects both borrowers and lenders. The bor\u00ad rowers experience a number of problems-they have monthly pay\u00ad ments which are initially high relative to their income, and be\u00ad cause of these payments they are \"house poor\"; that is, they don't have sufficient income to make other purchases they want or need. In addition, because of mortgage writing standards and their income, borrowers can only buy a small house. This doesn't take into account buyers' long-term income expectation or their housing needs. These are all items of the \"financing gap\" problem that can be amelior\u00ad ated by an alternative form of the mortgage instrument. The lender also experiences prob\u00ad lems with the SFPM, such as: Earnings on outstanding SFPM's have not kept pace with sharp increase in len\u00ad der's cost of funds. Lender's cost of funds de\u00ad creases the amount of funds available to support the mortgage market. Lenders are unable to pay their depositor the market rate of interest on their de\u00ad posits. However, the SFPM's are still used heavily. Table 1 shows the payment on our test home. Graduated Payntent Mortgage When a person graduates from high school or college and begins economic work life, the graduate assumes that yearly earnings will increase. There are aggregate na\u00ad tional figures available that show the average annual increase for individuals between their 20th and 30th birthdays is an 8 percent in\u00ad crease in pay per year. The graduated payment mortgage (GPM) recognizes this, and enables individuals to pay for their homes more easily in the early years. Under a GPM, a borrower in effect borrows additional money during the early years of the mortgage to reduce the monthly mortgage pay\u00ad ments due during this period. This additional loan is added to the mortgage and is repaid by slightly increasing payments made in later years. This will enable those who 76 expect income increases to take advantage of those expected in\u00ad creases and buy a home sooner. The GPM program is likely to appeal to first-time home buyers in the $14,000 to $25,000 income range. These individuals, who would have had difficulty meeting monthly mortgage payments under the SFPM, will now have five the mortgage balance. Thus, slight\u00ad ly larger downpayments are re\u00ad quired to ensure that the outstand\u00ad ing balance doesn't exceed the maximum permissible mortgage limit. For example, let's consider our test home valued at $66,000. Cur\u00ad rent Federal regulations require that the outstanding principal cannot Table 1 Monthly Payments on a $66,000 Home With A $60,000 Loan, 13% Interest Rate, 30-Year Term Year 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 end of 30 years Monthly of Graduation Term of Graduation 1 2 3 4 5 2.5% 5 % 7.5% 2 % 3 % payment plans to choose from, illustrated in Table 2. Three of the plans permit mortgage payments to increase at an annual rate of 2.5, 5, or 7.5 percent over the first 5 years of the loan. The other two plans permit payments to increase 2 and 3 percent annually over 10 years. Starting with the sixth year for the 5-year plans and the eleventh year for the 10-year plans, the payments will be level in amounts for the remaining term of the mort\u00ad gage. The greater the rate of increase, or the longer the period of increase, the lower the mortgage payments in the early years. The outstanding principal amount due on a graduated payment mort\u00ad gage increases during the initial years as unpaid interest is added to 5 years 5 years 5 years 10 years 10 years exceed 90 percent of purchase price at any time during the life of the mortgage. Our test home will have $60,000 as the maximum mortgage amount. For the five plans we would have the downpayments and loan amounts as shown in Table 3. Table 4 shows the resulting month\u00ad ly mortgage payments, and Tables 5 and 6 show the interest paid and the outstanding prinCipal at the end of the year. Note that the highest outstanding principal is $60,000 in all cases. Tables 3 through 6 demonstrate that for the same house, these plans require a larger downpayment than the SFPM; however, they have lower monthly mortgage payments in the early years.

The regula- GAO Review I Summer 1980 3 4 5 $ interest rate to change no more than once a year, for a maximum of one-half of 1 percent. During the life of the mort\u00ad gage the interest rate can increase no more than 2.5 percent. The downward adjustments are unlim\u00ad ited. The determining factor of rate increase or decrease is an index, in some cases the cost of funds to savings and loan associations. The index used will be specified on the mortgage instrument. This instrument has several ad\u00ad vantages over the standard mort\u00ad gage. For the consumer, it allows downward adjustment in the mort\u00ad gage interest rate without the prob\u00ad lem of refinancing. It provides the lender with some \"interest risk\" protection, in that the loan interest rate can increase. Thus, the lender can offer a lower starting interest rate. Also, this instrument would allow the lender to pay a higher return to the depositor, to maintain support to the mortgage market and the possibility to protect profit. We may all know people who have SF PM with a 6 to 7 percent interest rate. These loans are probably from savings and loan as\u00ad sociations that are today paying 14 percent for funds. This excess of cost over revenue could cause as\u00ad sociations to go out of business, seriously harming the mortgage market, and eventually, all of us. Again using the $66,000 house with a $6,000 down payment, Table 7 shows the worst-case increase in interest rates. Rollover Mortgage The rollover mortgage is a special case of the variable rate mortgage. This type of instrument is used widely in Canada, where the finan\u00ad cial institutions issue 5-year bonds. The yield on these bonds deter\u00ad mines the interest rate that institu\u00ad tions charge the borrower. The rate may change at the end of each 5-year term. The regulations in the U.S. differ from those in Canada. U.S. regula\u00ad tions limit the increase in the interest rate for the life of the mort\u00ad gage to five points (5 percent). The downward adjustments are unlim\u00ad ited. This enables the home bor\u00ad rower to gai n any advantage of a downward movement of interest rate without the problem of refi\u00ad nancing. In periods of increasing interest rates, it allows the savings and loan industry to remain com\u00ad petitive with the rest of the money market.

However, since the payment will change every 5 years (using the worst-case exam\u00ad ple), Table 8 will have a slightly dif\u00ad ferent format. 78 Cum. Outstanding Costs The previous tables contain only the principal and interest (PI) portion of the monthly mortgage payments. A number of factors (such as taxes, home insurance, utilities, maintenance, and repairs) were not included. These costs would not vary, based on the type of mortgage instrument used. They do vary from one part of the country to the other. If you are a proposed buyer or seller, you could calculate these costs for your area and add them to the monthly payment. There is a general rule of thumb (used by leasing institutions) that total monthly mortgage payments should be in the range of 25 to 33 percent of a person's gross monthly in\u00ad come. From this, you can calculate the most house you could purchase for each type of mortgage instru\u00ad ment and/or the income a buyer would need to purchase your home at your asking price. Interest Rate Many people would like to know when the interest rate is going to be lower. The recipe cartoon indicates that the interest rate can be divided into four parts. One of these \"ingredients\" must decline before the interest rate on homes can drop. So you ask, \"What is the real cost of money?\" It is a concept of what Person A would charge Person B to use A's funds, if the loan were a riskless loan and no (zero) inflation was occurring. It is considered between 2 to 3 percent. This com\u00ad ponent will not decrease. Well then, how about the mort\u00ad gage payback period? The trend has been to increase this variable from 1 year, to 20 years, to 25 years, to the current 30 years for the normal home mortgage. From the lender's point of view, the longer the term, the greater the chance of an interest rate increase (interest rate risk). Therefore, the shorter the mortgage term, the lower the risk and, in theory, the lower the rate the lender charges. However, the shorter the term, the higher the monthly mort\u00ad gage payment. Does the assumed risk offer a better hope? Yes and no. Risk is made up of several parts. One part is the \"interest rate risk,\" discussed above. Another part is the \"lost risk.\" If a person didn't inake a pay\u00ad ment, and. the property was de\u00ad fau Ited and the lender sold the property, would the lender recover GAO Rene .... / Summer 1980 INTEREST RATE RECIPE 1 part\u00b7 real cost of money 1 part\u00b7 inflation expectations 1 part\u00b7 mortgage payback period 1 part\u00b7 assumed risk the amount of the loan plus his foreclosure expense? This risk, from the lender's viewpoint, can be lessened by a larger downpayment and by a general economy having real growth with nearly full employ\u00ad ment Can the home buyer afford a larger down payment for a lower interest rate? That leaves the inflation expecta\u00ad tion. How does this affect the interest rate and how can the indi\u00ad vidual affect inflation? Most people with money to lend like to maintain their wealth. If wealth is measured in purchasing power, then the lender must earn at least the infla\u00ad tion rate on their money to' maintain their wealth. Since no one knows what inflation will be, we all work with our personal idea of inflation expectation. If these expectations can be lowered, then the interest rates should decrease. The individ\u00ad ual has no control over inflation expectation, except the power to vote for public officials who will follow policies to limit inflation. One factor not mentioned affect\u00ad ing the interest rate is the demand for funds. This article was written viewing the dollars (funds) present\u00ad ly in the mortgage market and not with the idea of increasing or de\u00ad creasing these funds in relation to other sectors. For that reason, the demand for funds is not discussed. We have now reviewed a number of mortgage instruments and briefly discussed interest rates. Table 9 provides a short summary of these mortgage instruments and selected costs for our $66,000 sample home.

Edueate Yourself Before You Buy Or Sell A home mortgage is a contract that most of us will make during our lifetime. It determines the type of payments we will be making for 20 to 30 years. Because changes in these instruments substantially af\u00ad fect how we buy or sell homes, it is important to maintain a general Knowledge in the area. The Department of Housing and Urban Development furnishes a number of publications on home buying and mortgage instruments. 1 Some are free; others have a small charge. However, if you are Signing a contract that commits you to large payments over time, a $10 to $20 cost for some publications mCj.Y be a good investment. In addition, a Am.ortization Formula For those of you who may be interested in calculating what your payment would be using these mortgage instruments, you will need the following amortization formulas.2 First is the explanation of what the factors in the formulas are: P = A = ir = m = Pt = OPt t = monthly mortgage payment loan amount at origination nominal interest rate divi\u00ad ded by 12 number of months of mort\u00ad gage monthly mortgage pay\u00ad ment, at time t = outstanding principal, at time t number of payments already made 79 Alternative Mortgage Instruments-Their Importance To You r = annual rate of increase in monthly payment k = number of years payment will increase s = number of months to matu\u00ad rity of the loan Now that you have gathered this information, here are the formulas: The formula for the standard mort\u00ad gage gives the single payment (P) necessary to amortize the loan. The VRM and rollover mortgage pay\u00ad ment (Pt) must be recalculated each time the interest rate or term changes. The formula for the grad\u00ad uated payment mortgage gives the first month payment (Ps). This value is then multiplied by r (the annual rate of increase to obtain the monthly mortgage payments for future years). 80 A. Standard Mortgage Instrument B.

GAO Review / Summer 1980 Eugene M. Zuckert Mr. Zuckert is a partner in the law firm of Zuckert, Scout! and Rosenberger. He is a former Secretary of the Air Force and Com\u00ad missioner of the Atomic Energy Commis\u00ad sion. Adapted from a November 19, 1979 speech presented by Mr. Zuckert to the Washing\u00ad ton chapter of the I nstitute of Internal Auditors. GAO Review/Summer 1980 Perspeetives on. Changes in Internal Auditing I have great respect for the auditing profession, and I want you to understand it at the outset because I am going to say some things with which I am sure you will heartily disagree. While I was doing the research for this article, I found that yours is a much older profes\u00ad sion than I thought. While perhaps not the oldest profession in the world, it is perhaps even older than mine, the legal profession. Histor\u00ad ians tell me that auditing began either with the advent of taxation, or when the oldest profession was transformed from the status of a single proprietorship into an indus\u00ad try. I want to address the evolution of the internal auditor's function in two areas. One is the internal auditor in Government, and the other is the internal auditor in business. Because I have been devoting most of the last 15 years to business, I hadn't been aware of the development of the internal auditor in Government expected through the Inspector General Act of 1978. You remember the Inspector Gener\u00ad al Act was passed because of evi\u00ad dence that fraud, abuse, and waste in the operations of the Federal Government were commonplace. Examples of fraud were uncovered in the Department of Agriculture food stamp program, GSA con\u00ad tracts, and HEW federally-funded programs. Waste and mismanage\u00ad ment were also considered to be widespread in many other Govern\u00ad ment agencies, though thetr prob\u00ad lem was a bit more difficult to pin down. Because the Congress found Government detection and preven\u00ad fion efforts unsatisfactory, it decid:': ed to establish statutory Offices of Inspector General to correct exist\u00ad ing deficiencies and prevent future ones from occurring. As a former agency head, I applaud the wider use of an inspector general with investigative and auditing func\u00ad tions. From my own experience, I know how important it is to have an effective, competent investigative organization as a key element of the defensive team. This is essential for a Government administrator. I must confess that 15 years ago I had a much closer relationship with the investigator than I did with the auditor. Inspeetor General Too Insulated The Inspector General Act en\u00ad sures, in my opinion, that the agency head is going to know and utilize the internal auditor. There is a growing opportunity for the pro\u00ad fessional development and useful\u00ad ness of the internal auditor. That's the good news. On the other side, I believe that in an attempt to combat corruption in Government, the Congress has overreacted by giving the inspector general and his staff an unwar\u00ad ranted degree of job insulation. This an.d the reporting functions give the office a potentially danger\u00ad ous weapon, one which is open to great political exploitation. As a lawyer, I am not objecting merely on constitutional grounds of the separation of powers between the legislative and executive. The thrust of the law makes it practically im\u00ad possible to fire the inspectors general. I do not object to the fact that they are Presidential appoin\u00ad tees. In reality, they are not respon\u00ad sible to the agency heads with whom they work. As a reSUlt, the agency head has, as top manager, lost no responsibility, but has lost a significant measure of authority. The inspector general's charter to free-wheel goes far beyond tracking down corruption in the agency\u00ad riot justin my book; this is what the law says. It gets into the gray areas of efficiency of operations where it is possible for reasonable people to differ. Given a confrontation, the agency head wi II too often be at a disadvantage, partly because of the reporting provisions-the fast track 81 Perspective8 On Change8 In Intemal Auditing the inspector general has through semiannual reports to the Con\u00ad gress. The result of this kind of thinking, that puts a person in an organization without a superior to whom he or she is responsible, is demeaning to the top executive and adds to the difficulty of discharging already formidable responsibilities. Again, let's be sure that I am clear. I applaUd the concept of an inspector general with investigative and auditing responsibilities, but I believe that in its effort to root out evil, the Congress, as it so often does, has gone too far. While preparing this article, I consulted one of the outstanding practitioners and students of man\u00ad agement whom I know. I asked him for an appraisal of the inspector general legislation. His comment was: \"In setting up the inspector general in this fashion, the Con\u00ad gress has done nothing more than set up a super commissar.\" Now if this were a Russian organization, we would say that was bad. As with most unsoundly conceived organi\u00ad zations, they can work for a time. I have consulted some people who are participating in the system, and they tell me that the inspector general operation has gotten off to a good start. But the test of the structure is, as always, stress, and I am not optimistic. Oversight Aetions in Business Let me explain my views on the state of the internal auditor in busi\u00ad ness. These years have seen a great surge in the demand that corporate enterprise assume a more public character. We have come far beyond the requirements for disclosure that were embodied in the early New Deal reforms. Demands for higher standards of ethics and greater social responsibility have produced not just voluntary action, but laws, enforcement of those laws, and regulatory action. They made it necessary for business to change many of its concepts of organiza\u00ad tion a:nd operation. The exatnple which has the most effect upon your own profession, of course, is the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) with its requirements that corporate internal controls be thorough Iy eff.ective. 8~ You will recall that the FCPA was passed in 1977 as a reaction to the disclosure of widespread bribing of top officials of foreign governments by U.S. corporations. The statute goes far beyond regulating conduct of U.S. companies overseas. The second part of the act is directed to all companies reporting to the Securities and Exchange Commis\u00ad sion (SEC), whether or not they have any foreign operations or transactions. The second section is concerned with accounting standards, and its purpose, briefly put, is to ensure that corporate books accurately re\u00ad flect corporate activity. The SEC states that compliance makes it im\u00ad portant that \"issues subject to the new requirements review their ac\u00ad counting procedures, systems of internal accounting control and business practices.\" The effect of this movement toward greater and different corpor\u00ad ate responsibility is an entirely new outlook among the key corporate actors. Boards of directors have changed in composition and opera\u00ad tion. There is a trend toward more outside than inside directors. In fact, in Martin Marietta, there are only two inside directors. Some companies appoint to their boards individuals who represent primarily social interests rather than those of the stockholders. Boards are now more participative in their over\u00ad sight. One mechanism for that is the increasing use of committees, particularly auditing, nominating, and compensation committees. The effect of the pressure on the board is to move it into the role of constructive management critic rather than the wholehearted advo\u00ad cate of management. This is a delicate relationship; there must be continuing care to ensure that boards are truly participative and yet do not destroy management's responsibility for operating deci\u00ad sions. This evolution toward more and difficult corporate responsibil\u00ad ities has changed the role of the top manager. Strengthening Business Defenses Fifteen years ago, I gave talks about the difference between the jobs of the top public and top pri-vate administrator. The theme was that the public administrator has to spend a greater share of time and effort in what I called defensive operations, those having nothing to do with forwarding the programs for which he or she is responsible. That difference between the pub\u00ad lic and private top administrator, the emphasis on defensive opera\u00ad tions, is being sharply reduced. Today's business executive is ob\u00ad viously concerned with profit, but is also greatly involved with the myriad problems in corporate re\u00ad sponsibility; ethical standards, en\u00ad vironment, employment standards and practices, and the effectiveness of the company's internal controls. Here again, as in the case of the board of directors, we must strive for balance among responsibilities. The effectiveness of our system depends upon industry manage\u00ad ment capable of being competitive and productive in an ever more difficult environment. Just as the board and top man\u00ad agement have changed their focus, it is inevitable that those elements upon which management must depend for defensive operations need to add to their responsibil\u00ad ities. I refer to principally the inde\u00ad pendent auditor, the general coun\u00ad sel, and the internal auditor. They are the bu Iwarks of the new defen\u00ad sive team upon whom top manage\u00ad ment must depend. This becomes particularly true when we consider the pressures resulting from the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the pressures exerted by the SEC, and other attacks upon questionable and illegal corporate conduct. The remarkable element of this develop\u00ad ment is the increased degree of independence from management expected of the general counsel and the internal auditor. In your case, there is insistent demand that the internal auditor report to the audit committee of the board, as well as a high enough level of internal man\u00ad agement so that it can be reason\u00ad ably assured there will be objective consideration of findings and rec\u00ad ommendations. What is my response to that as an audit committee chairman? In the first place, I am in favor of it. As chairman, the committee and I must satisfy ourselves about the organ izational and reporting ar- GAO Review/Summer 1980 rangements under which the auditor functions. And the audit committee has to make it quite clear to the management, and to the auditor, that it expects direct communica\u00ad tion when the internal auditor be\u00ad lieves it warranted. This may take a lot of courage on the part of the internal auditor, but that is what we expect. More difficult, but essen\u00ad tial, .is that the audit committee knows enough about the auditor's operation to be satisfied that there is an effective internal auditing pro\u00ad gram. This requires that we know the auditor well enough to have confidence in his or her character, maturity, and ability. It requires an understanding of the auditor's ac\u00ad tivities, and the extent to which the audit office is effectively staffed. In making such a determination, the audit committee needs to know how the outside auditor appraises the operations of the internal auditor. Proposed Role for the Internal Auditor It would be unreasonable to expect that in the brief period of the importance of the internal auditor we have solved all the inherent problems of concept and operation. For example, some questions which concern me are what should be the areas in which internal auditors function? Besides auditing for integrity of operations, what are the auditor's responsibilities for the development of internal control systems? Should the internal audi\u00ad tor perform management or opera\u00ad tional audits? What is the most effective relationship between the external and the internal auditor? How can we best use the comple\u00ad mentary skills and responsibilities of the mternal auditor and the general counsel? Those are but a few. At this point in the development of the internal auditor, except in situations where the internal audi\u00ad tor has an extremely mature and accepted organization, the manage\u00ad ment or operational audits should take a subordinate role. This is a matter of the priorities and limita\u00ad tions of talent and experience that so often exist. In addition to its oversight of the honesty of the cor\u00ad poration's activities, I believe that GAO Review/Summer 1980 Perspectives On Changes In Internal Auditing through the auditing process, the internal auditor should give urgent attention to becoming the corporate expert in the development and operation of internal control sys\u00ad tems. The complexity of corporate operations as they are, and the dy\u00ad namic growth of automated data processing, make this area a for\u00ad midable challenge and absolutely essential to effective corporate response to the demands of the law and public opinion. In my view, achieving such an objective re\u00ad quires increased corporate manage\u00ad ment's recognition of the profes\u00ad sional responsibilities involved. We have a long way to go in developing a career path for internal auditing that will attract, retain, and develop the quality of personnel needed to accomplish the tasks. Improving Defensive Efforts I have placed great stress on the need to improve what I call the de\u00ad fensive side of corporate opera\u00ad tions, and appropriately, particular emphasis is placed upon the inter\u00ad nal auditor. It is my belief that the effectiveness of these defensive operations goes far beyond enab\u00ad ling the corporation to meet the requirements of laws and regula\u00ad tions. I believe that the corporate response to this growing problem will have a critical influence on whether our corporate system, as we know it, survives. I have mentioned the recent vast changes in the way corporations and their boards of directors func\u00ad tion. About a year ago, I coauthored an article about corporate govern\u00ad ance and corporate boards, in which my coauthor and I concluded that so many changes had been made with the development of the outside board and the greater activ\u00ad ity of the board committees, that before new changes are made, there should be a breathing spell to per\u00ad mit us to gain experience with these initial changes. That is a beautiful view, but in one year I have concluded it's pretty naive. Clearly, we failed to take into account the strength and breadth of the move\u00ad ment aimed at the so-called demo\u00ad cratization of corporations. Tom Hayden, Ralph Nader, Senator Met-zenbaum, the AFL-CIO, to name but a few, are taking dead aim at the legitimacy of the American corpora\u00ad tion. As is usual with reformers and reorganizers, they focus on flaws they find in the established order and give no consideration to pre\u00ad serving the strengths and contribu\u00ad tions of the system as it exists. As a professed friend of industry, the Chairman of the SEC has warned us that failure of busines\\S to respond, . to the letter and spirit of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act will invite increasingly more stringent Federal corporate accountability measures. An interesting development of great potential significance is the provision of the Chrysler rescue effort that would place Douglas Fraser of the United Auto Workers on the board. This could be an isolated event resulting from the special circumstances of the Chrys\u00ad ler case. I bel ieve it is more likely one step along the lines of Euro\u00ad pean precedent toward a basic change in corporations and their fundamental nature. The only re\u00ad sponse which will be salutary under these circumstances is timely, ag\u00ad gressive, and constructive response by corporations. The best way to stem the tide of reform is to place real emphasis, not just lip service, upo'n mechanisms and actions de\u00ad signed to assure and make manifest corporate integrity. A strong, effec\u00ad tive internal auditor is one of the most important mechanisms. In this battle, in which I think all of us are concerned with the prospering of the American corporate system, you, as internal auditors, have a key role to play. 83 Martin M. Ferber Mr. Ferber, a group director in the Logistics and Communications Division, began his career with GAO in 1968. He has a B.S. degree in accounting from the University of Maryland and an M.SA degree in govern\u00ad mental administration from the George Washington University. He has worked on defense, civil, and international audits, and formerly served in the European Branch and the Office of Program Planning. Mr. Ferber is a previous contributor to the GAO Review. 84 GAO Pinaneial Savings: Defense Audits Lead The Way Measurable financial savings re\u00ad sulting from GAO audits are great\u00ad annually many times its operating budget-and most come from defense-related audits. In today's competitive environment, being as\u00ad sociated with such audits may provide a competitive edge that staff members should consider in their career and goal planning. Although many GAO staff mem\u00ad bers already find personal rewards in audits of defellse and other Logistics and Communications Di\u00ad vision (LCD) areas, there are others who haven't been exposed to the \"defense\" side of GAO and may not be aware of the importance of GAO's defense work and challenges Moreover, our defense reports are useful to the Congress. The Comp\u00ad troller General went on to testify that: * * * I just reread the House Ap\u00ad propriations' Committee Report on the Department of Defense FY 1979 appropriations bill. That re\u00ad port refers some 93 times to GAO reports and recommendations. * * * In many instances, it trans\u00ad lates our findings and recommen\u00ad dations into reductions in DOD appropriations where this is ap\u00ad propriate to prevent waste. LCD's Share 01 GAO's Finaneiat it offers. GAO's financial savings are nificant and LCD contributes great\u00adImportanee 01 Delense Iy to them. As shown in the table, Audits for fiscal years 1976 through 1979, Testifying on GAO's fiscal year 1980 budget request, the Comptrol\u00ad ler General stated that GAO wi II need to increase the proportion of resources devoted to defense\u00ad related work-it should constitute 25 percent of GAO's total effort. Some statistics explain why de\u00ad fense audits are so important. For example, during fiscal years 1978 and 1979, GAO's defense-related work, although consuming less than 25 percent of GAO's resources, accounted for 65 percent of GAO's measurable financial savings, in\u00ad cluding 51 percent of actual collec\u00ad tions. GAO reported measurable financial savings of almost $13 billion dollars-over 18 times operating expenses during the same period. During this 4-year period, LCD's measurable financial savings in\u00ad creased annually and totaled about $3.4 billion. LCD, in programming 10 percent of GAO's audit effort, accounted for over 26 percent of GAO's measurable savings.' Challenging Work There are many aspects of the defense area that present audit challenges for GAO staff. For example, the sensitivity of the area Measurable financial savings GAO's operating expenses Fiscal year 1976 1977 1978 1979 Total from GAO operations (millions of dollars) $ Summer 1980 requires GAO to \"walk a tightrope\" so that we do not make judgments on military strategy and tactics or threat assessment. Instead we must confine our judgments to the capability of the military to carry out the strategy and tactics they have decided are required. To obtain the sensitive data in this area requires GAO auditors to be effective negotiators, deal with access to records problems, and appropriately handle classified ma\u00ad terial. Also, because the United States' military policies involve changing worldwide scenarios, GAO auditors are challenged to understand these scenarios and relate their requirements to military programs and audit objectives. Finally, because of the sensitivity of the area and the military's somewhat parochial attitude, solid audit support and constructive au\u00ad dit recommendations are needed to effect improvements. Logisties and Communieations Division Although primarily defense re\u00ad lated, LCD also has responsibility for some civil agency functions. Statistically, LCD has about 8 percent of GAO headquarters' staff and programs 10 percent-444 staff years-of GAO's audit work. Pri\u00ad marily this effort is in five LCD-led issue areas: Logistics management Facilities acquisition and managment Military readiness Federal information Communications A report by the House Republican Study Committee also recognized the contribution GAO can make to the Government. Speaking on the report in September 1979, Repre\u00ad sentative Gerald B. Solomon (R-N.Y.) stated that \"*** if the advice of GAO is followed, the American taxpayer will have been spared bill ions of dollars.\" The report, which identified ex\u00ad amples of fraud, waste, abuse and mismanagement in the Federal Government, highlighted 25 GAO reports. Again LCD was prominent, with 8 reports totaling $1.9 billion GAO Review/Summer 1980 GAO Financial Savings: Defense Audits Lead the Way in savings, 44 percent of the GAO total. Relationship With Competitive Environment GAO staff are well aware of today's competitive environment in competitive selection and the up\u00ad coming merit pay and senior execu\u00ad tive service systems, but may not have thought of LCD audits as they can relate to this environment. Because there is so much com\u00ad petition, staff members must look to areas that can provide the \"edge\" to help make them desirable em\u00ad ployees. Some areas are obvious\u00ad chances to demonstrate leadership supervisory competence, and pro\u00ad fessional development-but others are more subtle, such as working on audits resulting in measurable savings which help GAO pay for itself many times over. Such exper\u00ad ience, when measured against others, may provide just the edge that the staff member needs. After all, it's hard to argue with success that can be measured in dollars and cents. The Direetor's Perspeetive During one of my first meetings with Richard W. Gutmann, LCD's director, he philosophized on the importance of LCD's work and its large contribution to GAO's finan\u00ad cial savings. Since his philosophy was the impetus to this article, I asked him to expound on his views. Mr. Gutmann believes that the statistics, as compiled in this article impressively show the im\u00ad portance to GAO of LCD aud it and analytical work. He also shares my views that the potential for contributing to GAO's financial savings should be considered by individuals in their career and goal planning. To further encourage this, Mr. Gutmann feels that GAO could be more generous with its cash awards when feasible, making the amounts more commensurate with the mag\u00ad nitude of the measurable savings resulting from an individual's per\u00ad formance. He also feels there is a role in the competitive environment for performance which contributes to financial savings. However, since many GAO audits do not provide the opportunity to achieve measur\u00ad able savings, it is difficult to deter\u00ad mine what this role should be. For example, staff members may work on audits that result in more Federal funds being spent to re\u00ad spond to congressional intent. Such performance is equally impor\u00ad tant to GAO and should also be recognized. LCD and Career Planning By highlighting GAO's work that results in measurable financial savings, it is not my intention to downplay other GAO work which contributes greatly in areas which cannot be as easily quantified\u00ad for example, direct advice and assistance to congressional com\u00ad mittees and staffs, and results\u00ad oriented evaluations of the mlllti\u00ad tude of Government programs. Yet, because savings from GAO efforts and their relationship to its costs are so dramatic, staff members should be aware of them and con\u00ad sider them in career and goal planning. As the statistics show, the greatest opportunities are on defense audits and LCD audits in general. Want to find out more about LCD? In the summer of 1979, LCD published a booklet, \"Welcome to the Logistics and Communications Division,\" which explains not only the issue areas but LCD in general. Rather than summarizing here, I suggest interested staff members read the booklet. (Copies are avail\u00ad able from Room 5804, or call FTS 275-6518). By showing the ques\u00ad tions addressed in each issue area and examples of assignments, the booklet is especially useful to field staff who may get the opportunity to work on LCD audits. 1 Eliminating an extraordinary GAO fiscal year 1977 Government-wide saving of $3.8 billion makes LCD's 4-year share even more dramatic-37 percent. 85 UnaeeustoDled As I Am ... Although GAO staff would not write speeches for Members of Congress, many help write testimony for the Congress and some draft remarks for public speaking engagements of Mr. Staats or other senior GAO officials. Mr. Whittier's insights can apply to many aspects of this work. Charles H. Whittier Charles Whittier is an analyst in American National Government (humanities and religion), Government Division of the Congressional Research Service. Reprinted with permission from the Congressional Research Service Review, January 1980. 86 President Theodore Roosevelt rouses a crowd with his speech making. Few public speakers have captivated audiences as he did. (Library of Congress photo). \"Half the world,\" wrote Robert Frost, \"is composed of those who have something to say and can't say it, the other half of those who have nothing to say and keep on saying it.\" The demand for speeches and public statements on every conceivable issue and occasion is a constant challenge to Members of Con\u00ad gress who are already burdened with heavy work loads. Having something to say and being able to say it clearly and well requires some .reliance on speech writers, whose task is to express the Member's ideas persuasively, to inform, to motivate, to inspire\u00ad at times even to entertain. Those who help in preparing speech drafts, whether by gathering information or clothing it in effec-tive rhetoric, share in the process called \"ghostwriting,\" which began on these shores with the Founding Fathers. Today the \"ghostwriter,\" formerly heard but never seen, is both seen and heard, often highly visible, even a celebrity-a Good\u00ad win, a Sorensen, a Fallows, a Hertzberg. Ghostwriters, in the public image, subordinate them\u00ad selves so that the final product re\u00ad flects both the ideas and the style of the speaker. In practice, ghost\u00ad writer roles may range from that image to something considerably more influential, with salaries in proportion. The \"secret\" of effective speech\u00ad writing-apart from practice and experience, certainly the best teachers-is learning to \"write aloud,\" for the ear rather than for GAO Renew I Summer 1980 the eye. \"The best orator,\" says an Arab proverb, \"is one who can make men see with their ears.\" So, too, with the best speechwriter. Easy intelligibility is a paramount concern so that the listening span is not strained. By numerous rhetorical techniques, the speaker states, restates, and states again in different ways the central themes of the speech. Repetition witn varia\u00ad tion emphasizes key elements while avoiding monotony. Martin Luther King's \"I have a dream\" speech is a striking example of this technique, using that phrase to introduce a series of future visions; similarly, Churchill's bold defiance of Hitler: We shall fight in France and on the seas and oceans; we shall fight with growing confi\u00ad dence and growing strength in the air. We shall defend our is\u00ad land whatever the cost may be; we shall figh t on the beaches and landing grounds, in fields, in streets and on the hills. Franklin D. Roosevelt's \"One\u00ad third of a Nation\" speech in 1937 imparts a sense of urgency by his deliberate repetition of a \"Here are ... \" construction to describe condi\u00ad tions in the country, followed again and again with \"now\": Here is one-third of a Nation ill-nourished, ill-clad, iI/\u00ad housed-NOW. Here are thousands upon thou\u00ad sands of farmers wondering whether next year's prices will meet their mortgage-interest\u00ad NOW. Here are thousands upon thou\u00ad sands of men and women laboring for long hours in fac\u00ad tories for inadequate pay\u00ad NOW. It is a technique used with great skill by Pope John Paul II during his recent visit to America, in a series of cadenced affirmations each be\u00ad ginning with the phrase, \"We will stand up.\" George Orwell's advice to cut out any word which can possibly be cut is helpful so long as the resulting effect is clarity and not verbal short\u00ad hand. Ciceronian oratory on the one hand and Dick-and-Jane simplicity on the other are extremes to be avoided. Moreover, no speech will sound fresh and vivid if it is not animated GAO Renew/Summer 1980 by imaginative imagery, by meta\u00ad phor in .its myriad forms (\"the hatred of entrenched greed\": America will always stand-for liberty\": Democracy is the healthful lifeblood which circulates through the veins and arteries of society ... \"; \"Whether in chains or in laurels, liberty knows nothing but victor\u00ad ies\"). As Emerson observed: \"Con\u00ad dense some daily experience into a glowing symbol, and an audience is electrified. \" Hold That (Mixed) Metaphor: Two or more metaphors in a sin\u00ad gle sentence or thought can be safely ventured only by the most nimble writers (\"To take arms against a sea of troubles\") without incurring ridicule, as in the famous example attributed to PRA VDA: \"The fascist octopus has sung its swan-song. \" Above all, in the spoken word there must be an element of identity and rapport with the listener, whether the speaker uses a \"natur\u00ad al\" conversational tone or a more oratical style. Effective speech\u00ad writing for Congress is not really a branch of \"creative writing.\" Its \"rules\" are meant to foster clarity of expression, whatever the occasion and purpose of any given speech. But mere clarity is not enough. Indeed, there are times when clarity and brevity are not appropriate. The issues may defy such treatment, or the occasion may call for some measure of deliberate ambiguity. Time, place, theme, purpose, method of approach-all these, once determined, will help shape the speech to the audience and to the occasion. A formal address to a learned society will differ dramati\u00ad cally from friendly remarks at a lodge banquet, yet for the speaker both should be equally Significant, prepared with the same attention to audience, occaSion, and purpose. Having a fixed time stimulates careful preparation. Both a time limit and notes or text help guard against logorrhea or excessive verb\u00ad iage. They also encourage the speaker not to try saying everything there is to be said on the speech topic, a temptation difficult to resist but capable of transforming an effective speech into an archive report. Unaccustomed As I Am ... Theme, audience, time and place-these being settled, the next concern is to gather ideas, facts, examples, illustrations, quo\u00ad tations, humor, whatever is needed to give substance, character, and interest to the speech. A wide range of resources are available for speechwriters. Plagiarize At Your Own Risk: The respo[lsible speechwriter will take great care in selecting material for use to quote accurately and to give full credit for whatever is bor\u00ad rowed outright. Plagiarism is ille\u00ad gal, at least in print, and conceivab\u00ad ly costly if proven. It is always unethical, and sometimes embar\u00ad raSSing. It remains, however, a gray area of the copyright laws and courts tend to weigh both degree and intent of alleged plagiarizing, and the extent of \"fair use.\" On the other hand, it is entirely proper to adapt existing materials to one's own purpose in preparing a new speech for any occasion. \"I did not,\" wrote Jefferson in re\u00ad sponse to accusations of plagiariz\u00ad ing the Declaration of Indepen\u00ad dence, \"consider it as any part of my charge to invent new ideas qlto\u00ad gether and to offer no sentiment which had ever been expressed before.\" Straining after originality\u00ad defined by \"Anon.\" as imitation not yet detected-can ruin the best of speeches. Throughout the speech, the writ\u00ad er ought to be constantly asking: \"What is it I am trying to say,\" and, after it is written: \"Have I, in fact, said it-clearly and well.\" \"There are those,\" wrote Pascal, \"who speak well, and do not write well. It is because the place, the audience, warms them, and elicits from their mind more than they find in it without this warmth.\" An effec\u00ad tive speaker solicits that warmth by first communicating it. Far more important than the schoolmarm's \"rules\" is the com\u00ad munication of personality by which a speech-as opposed to a lec\u00ad ture-is clothed with emotion and enthusiasm so that the speaker is perceived to be sincere and trust\u00ad worthy, neither \"talking over peo\u00ad ple's heads\" nor \"talking down\" to 87 Unaccustomed As I Am ... them. While this may belong more to the presentation or delivery, it should be striven for in the prepara\u00ad tion as well. In short, to quote again from a never-failing source, \"Anon.\" (as cited by H. L. Mencken): If wisdom's ways you wisely seek, Five things observe with care: Of whom you speak-to whom you speak, And how-and when-and where. The (se and, indeed, the virtual triumph in American political speaking of \"the popular conversa\u00ad tional idiom,\" with its emphasis on simplicity, brevity, and terseness, has tended, according to James L. Golden, to encourage \"simplistic language together with slogans or catch words,\" influenced by the techniques of mass media advertis- 88 ing. In a similar vein, Patrick Devlin points out, \"Repetition and reten\u00ad tion of a few simple ideas are stressed more than a complex con\u00ad cept.\" Golden too notes a growing trend towards a numbing mediocrity: \"Since the 1920s more political speakers have addressed larger audiences on a wider range of topics than at any time in history. Yet so marked is the decline in the quality of style that the majority of speeches are pedestrian, prosaic, and impotent.\" The remedy, in part, is to be found in the cultivation of style. \"Time should be devoted,\" writes Devlin, \"to using impressive lan\u00ad guage,\" which he defines as \"the most vivid, clear, concise, and meaningful style.\" It will be most effective if it bears the personal stamp of the speaker. \"The process of persuasion\" says James McBath and Walter Fisher, \"is '\" more a matter of communicating values than logical information.\" Finally, there is Franklin's warn\u00ad ing in Poor Richard's Almanac, addressed to those who would have something to say rather than those who feel that they must say some\u00ad thing: Best is the tongue that feels the rein; He that talks much, talks in vain; We from the wordy torrent fly: Who listens to the chattering pye?

Transportation for the Community and Economic Development Division. Prior to joining GAO in 1973, he was a member of the Technical Staff, the MITRE Corpora\u00ad tion, McLean, Virginia, where he special\u00ad ized in systems analysis and operations research studies of transportation prob\u00ad lems. He received his bachelor's degree in government with honors from Harvard Col\u00ad lege in 1959, and a master's degree in city planning from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1964, where he was awarded a Sears-Roebuck Fellowship. He recently attended the Federal Executive In\u00ad stitute's Executive Leadership and Manage\u00ad ment Program, in Charlottesville, Virginia. GAO Review / Summer 1980 A Week9s Worth This issue of the GAO Review contains a new feature-\"A Week's Worth\"-de\u00ad signed to capture the activities of various employees as they move through a week. The events described will emcompass work and home life, with the intention of getting a glimpse of the many experiences that affect various GAO staffers. Those who would like to let Review readers share their ex\u00ad periences for a week are invited to contact the Assistant Editor. Monday, January 21, 1980. This morning, Denny Dugan, GAO's chief economist, and a group of PAD staffers briefed Mr. Staats on the economrc factors and trends affecting the Chrysler Corporation. Public Law 96-185, the Chrysler Corporation Loan Guarantee Act of 1979, was signed by the President on January 7. The act established a board to administer the loan guar\u00ad antees-the Comptroller General is one of the three voting members. PAD has the lead responsibility for GAO's work on the loan guar\u00ad antees, and there are no plans for CEO to get directly involved. I attended the briefing to keep in\u00ad formed about what PAD was dOing and make sure CEO's work didn't conflict with it. The briefing was faSCinating. I was struck by Japan's growing share of the world auto production and the U.S. auto market. I think Japan's success partly reflects their emphasis on encouraging innova\u00ad tion and improving productivity. I'm very interested in these issues; my division director, Henry Eschwege, and I have jointly written an article on encouraging transportation in\u00ad novation for the April 1980 issue of Traffic Quarter/y. After the meeting, I went back to my office at DOT. In the courtyard, I met two friends from DOT. Bob Nutter was my boss at the MITRE Corporation-we worked on the Northeast Corridor Transportation Project together a decade ago. Bob and I worked as consultants for the other DOT staffer, Don Igo, back then. In the afternoon I revised the program plan for the transportation issue area. CED is the lead division for GAO's work in transportation. As issue area planning director, I'm responsible for putting the plan together. The Comptroller General's Program Planning Committee re\u00ad viewed the plan in November and approved it on the condition we make some changes recommended by the Office of Program Planning. Herb McLure, associate director of CEO's transportation operating group and the CEO/Trans group directors have suggested possible changes in the plan to address OPP's concerns-I revised these, made some editorial changes, and sent the plan back to OPP for their comments. I got home late, but my wife Joyce kept supper waiting. Tuesday, January 22, 1980. This morning Joyce and I took Route 66 to Charlottesville, Virginia, where I had agreed to give a lecture on transportation issues. A friend of mine, Ira Dye, is a visiting professor at the University of Virginia; I met Ira when he was director of the Office of Systems Analysis for the Department of Transportation. I spoke to one of Ira's classes in January 1979 on transportation issues in the 96th Congress, and he asked me to come back. Joyce took the day off from her job as an immi\u00ad gration specialist at the Library of Congress' Congressional Research Service to come with me. I enjoy public speaking; I'm scheduled to give the keynote address to the Warner Robins Air Logistics Cen\u00ad ter's annual transportation and traffic management conference in June on \"Transportation Issues in the 1980's.\" Ira's class was a graduate semi\u00ad nar in the Civil Engineering Depart\u00ad ment. I began my lecture with a brief overview of current issues, then focused in on the details of some issues I'm particularly inter\u00ad ested in: rail and truck deregula\u00ad tion, Amtrak, and mass transit operating subsidies. I gave a similar lecture last January, and the previous class seemed to like it more. Ira was complimentary afterwards, but it was clear that I needed to spend more time explaining how ICC regulation works-I think I lost part of the class at that point. On the way home, we stopped for barbecue sandwiches at the Three 89 A Week's Worth Pigs Restaurant in McLean-one of my favorite restaurants when I work\u20acd at MITRE-and had dessert at the McDonalds around the cor\u00ad ner. Wednesday, January 23, 1980. I spent the day talking on the phone and catching up on paperwork. My job used to be called \"transporta\u00ad tion program coordinator,\" and that's sti II an accurate description of what I spend much of my time doing. The actual mechanics of \"coordi\u00ad nation\" are simple. Before any GAO division can start a new audit or issue a report involving transporta\u00ad tion issues, the project has to be coordinated with CEO. As CEO's Issue Area Planning Directorl Transportation, I serve as the focal point for this activity. This means I spend a lot of time reading draft reports and descriptions of pro\u00ad posed audits, and talking with people about them. My goal is to know about every\u00ad thing GAO has done in the past, is doing now, and plans to do in the future, involving transportation. I want to know this so that I can make sure our work is accomplish\u00ad ing our planned goals and objec\u00ad tives, and doesn't seriously dupli\u00ad cate any of our work or the work of the other congressional support agencies: the Congressional Re\u00ad search Service, Congressional Bud\u00ad get Office, and Office of Tech\u00ad nology Assessment. To make the process work, it's necessary to be both aggressive and tactful. As a practical matter, my authority is limited. I try hard to understand the other person's point of view. Very little of what I do involves clear-cut decisions in which one side is right and the other wrong. In the evening, Joyce and I watched the State of the Union message after supper. Our daughter Jill was attending a conference-a meeting of the Maryland Associa\u00ad tion of Student Councils. Jill is a sophomore at Bethesda-Chevy Chase High School and active in student government. She's also a good student and an outstanding athlete. The net result is she's very busy and we see less of her than we used to. Thursday, January 24, 1980. Every year about this time, I meet 90 with the staff of the House and Sen\u00ad ate Appropriations Subcommittees on Transportation-the subcom\u00ad mittees which review and approve the budgets for the Department of Transportation and related agen\u00ad cies. Today, I visited Tom Kingfield and Larry Johnson, the staff mem\u00ad bers for the House subcommittee. At lunchtime, I took a cab to the Rayburn Building and met Torn and Larry in their offices next to the committee hearing room. We went downstairs to the Rayburn cafeteria for a sandwich. Tom is the senior staff member and an ex-GAOer; we discussed recent happenings at GAO over lunch. I brought along a computer printout, which showed the status of all of our audits at DOT and the other transportation agencies. After we finished lunch, we quickly went through the list and discussed audits which were of particular interest to the subcommittee. I've worked with Tom and his Senate counterpart, Jim English, for a number'of years, and we've devel\u00ad oped a good working relationship. They understand how GAO oper\u00ad ates, and make very productive use of our assistance. Over the next few months, our staff will meet with the subcommittee staff to discuss spe\u00ad cific audits in more detail. We'll also provide suggestions regarding issues that should be explored during the appropriations hearings. Friday, January 25, 1980. I spent the day reviewing the progress of one of the aud its for which I'm team director-a study of the Federal mass transit operating subsidy pro\u00ad gram. As team director, I'm respon\u00ad sible for the audit's overall direc\u00ad tion. Jim Bonnell from the Wash\u00ad ington regional office is team leader, responsible for the basic day-to-day management of the au\u00ad dit. On this multiregional assign\u00ad ment, Jim is in charge of staff from WRO, CED, BRO, NYRO, SFRO and ORO. He's doing an outstand\u00ad ing job-it's his second team leader assignment in the transportation area. When I joined GAO in 1973, projects were managed through a hierarchical management structure in which as many as four levels of management made decisions about an audit. This was a very thorough way to conduct our work, and kept mistakes to a minimum. It was also slow, and tended to diffuse the re\u00ad sponsibility for making decisions about a given project. I think the team approach is better. Manage\u00ad ment responsibilities are clearer, and the number of review levels has been reduced. We're getting our work out faster, and maintaining the quality of our products. I've been selected to attend the Federal Executive Institute later this year, and I hope to learn more about how other agencies organize project management responsibilities. Looking at GAO's transportation work from my perspective as issue area planning director, I think we're making a real contribution through improving the efficiency and effec\u00ad tiveness of the Federal Government and providing needed support to the Congress. Over the past year we've worked with all of the major congressional committees, provid\u00ad ing assistance through reports, testimony, briefings, and questions for hearings. We're working on the major issues in transportation: auto fuel economy, auto safety, mass transit, ICC regulation, railroad re\u00ad vitalization, Amtrak, highway needs and aviation safety. I think we're doing a good job-useful work that needs to be done. In the evening, Joyce and I went to the movies and saw \"Going in Style\" with George Burns. We enjoyed it. GAO Review/Summer 1980 Judith Hatter\u00b7 GAO Review/Summer 1980 Legislative Developments ____ _ GAO Legislation Both the General Accounting Office Personnel Act of 1980 and the General Accounting Office Act of 1980 have now been enacted into law (Public Law 96-191, February 15, 1980, and Public Law 96-226, April 3, 1980, respectively). Of the General Accounting Office Act, Senator John Glenn of Ohio states: * * * Fu ture historians may well look upon this piece of legislation as one of the most significant to emerge from the 96th Congress. The legislation is intended to strengthen the General Accounting Office's ability to discharge its func\u00ad tions as an investigative and auditing arm of the Con\u00ad gress. * .. 1 Reporting Requirements of the Law On March 24, Senator Abraham Ribicoff of Connecticut submitted legislation to discontinue or amend certain reporting requirements of the law. The bill, S. 2467, was introduced at the request of the Comptroller General to fulfill certain require\u00ad ments of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974. The Comptroller Gener\u00ad al, by the terms of that legislation, was required to monitor the various reporting requirements imposed by the Congress and recommend that any duplicative or unneeded report\u00ad ing be eliminated. The legislation would eliminate 18 reporting re\u00ad quirements and modify one other. Paperwork Reduetion Aet of 1980 On March 24, the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 passed the House of Representatives under suspension of rules. The purpose of the bill is to reduce paperwork and enhance the economy and efficien-cy of the Government and the pri\u00ad vate sector by improving Federal information policymaking. Among the objectives of the leg\u00ad islation, as explained in the report of the House Committee on Govern\u00ad ment Operations (H. Rept. No. 96- 835, March 19, 1980) is the estab\u00ad lishment of a single focal pOint for information management within the Office of Management and Bud\u00ad get-the Office of Federal Informa\u00ad tion Policy-which will have specif\u00ad ic authority, responsibility, and accountability to the President, the Congress, and the public for Gov\u00ad ernment-wide information policy and oversight. The legislation rewrites the Fed\u00ad eral Reports Act governing the clearance of information collection requests made by Federal agencies. All Federal agencies are subject to the act and the authority to approve agency data collection requests is consolidated in the Office of Man\u00ad agement and Budget. The Comp\u00ad troller General has supported the legislation in testimony and cor\u00ad respondence to the committee. Produetivity Improvement Aet of 1980 On March 12, Senator Lloyd Bentsen of Texas introduced the Productivity Improvement Act of 1980, which establishes a National Productivity Council to, among other things, develop and annually review a comprehensive national productivity plan. The following excerpt is from Senator Bentsen's remarks when he introduced the legislation: * * * Last April, I asked Elmer Staats, Comptroller General of the United States, to evaluate the wisdom of establishing a focal point for Federal efforts to stimulate productivity. Mr. Staats and the General Ac\u00ad counting Office were a logical choice for this task. More than 91 Legislative Developments any other official, Mr. Staats has consistently stressed the urgency of renewing our pro\u00ad ductivity growth. And more than any other Federal entity, he and his staff have plumbed the best minds worldwide in fashioning solutions to the question of how best to spur productivity. The legislation I am intro\u00ad ducing today reflects the best thinking of Mr. Staats and the GAO. It is drawn largely on material prepared by them. * * * National Publleations Aet or 1980 The Committee on House Admin\u00ad istration, House of Representa\u00ad tives, favorably reported a substi\u00ad version of H.R. 5424, to amend Title 44, U.S.C., to provide for improved administration of public printing services and distribution of public documents. (H. Rept. No. 96-836, Pt. 1, March 19, 1980) The amended bill proposes creat\u00ad ing a National Publications Office in the legislative, rather than execu\u00ad tive, branch of the Government. The amended version continues to re\u00ad quire audit of the activities of the Office by GAO. The bill has now been referred to the Government Operations and Rules Committees of the House. Control or Year-End Spending On April 15, Congressman Wil\u00ad liam l. Dickinson of Alabama intro\u00ad duced H.R. 7044, to require that not more than one-fourth of the budget authority of any department or agency of the executive branch may be obligated during the last quarter of the fiscal year. In his remarks introducing the legislation, Mr. Dickinson indicated that language suggested by the General Accounting Office in testi\u00ad mony before the Government Oper\u00ad ations Committee was incorporated in the bill. The Comptroller General is to review for the Congress a report to be provided by the Director of the Office of Management and Budget on the results of administration of this limitation and actions taken to strengthen the budget execution and procurement processes. The Comptroller General will make rec\u00ad ommendations concerning contin\u00ad uation of the limitation beyond 3 fiscal years. 1 Congressional Record, Vol.125, (Feb. 28, 1980), p. 82061.

Kenn~eth FaSick, director, International Division, was designated as assistant di\u00ad rector in Civil Accounting and Auditing Division in charge of audit of the Mili\u00ad tary Assistance Program and other defense-related pro\u00ad grams.

A news note on a \"skeleton hidden in the closet\"-a very unusual GAO finding. In April 1970, the Seattle news\u00ad letter reported: 93 Reflections 94 It finally had to happen. The auditees kidded the GAO auditors one time too many about having hidden the skeletons where the au\u00ad ditors couldn't find them. So our nominee for auditor-of\u00ad the-year, Sandy Olson, plunged into a dusty vault in the County Court House in Grants Pass, Oregon, to find and examine 33-year-old property tax assessment rec\u00ad ords, and uncovered a hu\u00ad man skull and assorted bones that were intermin\u00ad gled with the ancient rec\u00ad ords. Henceforth, if anyone tells you they've hidden the skele\u00ad tons where you can't find them, you can confidently say, \"Don't be too sure; one of our auditors did.\" [A County Commissioner told Sandy that the skull, believed to have come from a historic Indian grave, had originally been picked up by deputy sheriffs as evidence against grave robbers.] Comptroller General Staats testified on March 31, 1970, on cost accounting stan\u00ad dards for negotiated con\u00ad tracts before the Subcom\u00ad mittee on Production and Stabilization of the Senate Banking and Currency Com\u00ad mittee. Bill S. 3302 would extend the Defense Produc\u00ad tion Act and provide for the establishment of uniform cost accounting standards for defense contracts. The legislation was later passed by the Senate with an amendment providing for the establishment of a five\u00ad member Cost Accounting Standards Board with the Comptroller General as Chairman. The House Bank\u00ad ing and Currency Committee later held hearings on the same subject and the Comp\u00ad troller General testified on June 19, 1970. (Public Law 91-379, signed August 15, 1970.) The Comptroller General al\u00ad so testified on the following: Status of the defense profits study at a hearing before the Subcommittee on Economy in Government of the Joint Economic Committee, May 20, 1970; on the F-111 air\u00ad craft program, before the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations of the Senate Committee on Government Operations, April 28, 1970; and on a bill to establish an Office of Technology As\u00ad sessment as an arm of the Congress, on May 20, 1970, before the Subcommittee on Science, Research, and De\u00ad velopment of the House Science and Astronautics Committee. In a memorandum dated May 25, 1970, President Nixon directed that an intensive program evaluation effort be initiated in each executive department and agency and results reported to the then Bureau of the Budget, prede\u00ad cessor of the Office of Man\u00ad agement and Budget. Re\u00ad sults were to be considered in formulating the next year's budget. Announcement of a revised policy on qualifications of public accountants doing audits of federally chartered, financed, or regulated pri\u00ad vate organizations. The Comptroller General an\u00ad nounced this change in GAO policy in a letter dated April 17,1970, to the Chairman of the General Subcommittee on Labor of the House Com\u00ad mittee on Education and Labor, and in a circular let\u00ad ter to the heads of depart\u00ad ments and agencies (B- 148144, May 12, 1970). The prior policy, sometimes called the GAO model audit language, called for audits by independent CPAs or in\u00ad dependent licensed public accountants; the revised pol\u00ad icy provided for such audits by CPAs only after Decem\u00ad ber 31, 1975, with the pro\u00ad vision that, if heads of agen\u00ad cies deemed it necessary in the public interest, they might prescribe higher stan\u00ad dards than those imposed by State regulatory authorities.

Frese, former director of the old Accounting and Auditing Policy Staff, was honored in De\u00ad cember at the Boston Association of Government Accountants Emerg\u00ad ing Issues Conference. Mr. Frese was AGA's second national presi\u00ad dent. Carolyn Zimmerman, former sec\u00ad retary to the Comptroller General, is now making her retirement home in Memphis after selling her home in Dover, Pa. Clarence Jauchem, former assis\u00ad tant director in the old Office of Policy and Special Studies, has been traveling all over the world since his retirement. He helps developing countries improve their financial reporting and accounting systems, and recently went to Liberia for what was to be a 3-month stay. He was fiscal adviser to the Minister of Finance for 5 whole days when a coup overthrew the Liberian government. \"Joe\" and his wiffl had an exciting (but dan\u00ad gerous) time leaving the country, but we are glad to report they made it home safe and sound.

GAO Renew (Summer 1980 W. Va. He helped organize the ShannondaleClub, Ltd., and served as President and Chairman of its Board. Recently he was reported to be at Fiesta Key Resort, Long Key, Fla., where he is enjoying fishing on his new 21-foot boat. It was with regret we learned that Harold Ryder, former regional man\u00ad ager of our Los Angeles office, passed away on May 9, at the age of 84. Mr. Ryder retired on December 30, 1965, with over 30 years service in the Federal Government, includ\u00ad ing more than 22 years with GAO. In 1943, Mr. Ryder transferred to GAO in Los Angeles where he served as an area chief in the former Audit Division. When the Los Angeles regional office was established in 1952,he became its first regional manager and served in that capacity with distinction until he retired. Hal Ryder had a distinguished career, marked by an exemplary perfor\u00ad mance that won the respect and confidence of his associates within as well as outside of GAO. He was a stimulating and vital force in guid\u00ad ing and helping others and had been an inspiration to all who knew him. In response to requests for information about retirees, I re\u00ad ceived a very interesting and infor\u00ad mative letter from A. T. Samuelson, former Assistant Comptroller Gen\u00ad eral, about his retirement activities. Much of it is reproduced here: Dear Mrs. Clark: At\u00b7 the time of my visit to Washington in early December, you suggested I write a sessions which included such subjects as \"Mining and Environment,\" \"Water Politics in the 20th Century,\" and \"The Indian Claims Commission in Retrospect,\" sub\u00ad jects that as you may recall were concerns of the Civil Division for many years. By meeting at San Diego, the occasion afforded me a few days at LQs Angeles and San Francisco and a visit to the GAO regional offices in those cities. Also to have dinner with John Thornton and Jim Hall. Interest in history is a sort of an activity that has a large number of opportunities and variations for selection, specialization, and range, as nearly every State has a historical society of some kind and one of the better ones in my opinion is the Mon\u00ad tana HistoricaJ Society, who publish quarterly a very outstanding magazine called \"Montana the Magazine on Western History.\" In fact, it is so good that I developed an ongoing project of collecting back issues since its initial publication in 1951 and I am now lacking only three issues for a complete set in almost uncirculated condition. piece about avoiding boredom in retire-A.T. Samuelson ment, stemming from my comment that I didn't now have the time to do all the things that I wanted to do. After thinking about this comment, part of the answer is that I have deyeloped interests in a number of ac- tivities that did not do during pre-retire- ment, but part is due to now pursuing certain activities more intensively or more vigorously and thus now more time consuming. One of these activities is that related to American history, particularly Western history. Among the organizations involved in this interest is the Western History Associ.ltion, an organization whose mem\u00ad bership is largely professional historians and history academics, but also a fair number of so-called American history \"buffs,\" such as me. As with all active organizations, this one also has an annual conference, and this year it was held in Oc\u00ad tober at San Diego, California. Meetings over a four-day period were divided into 22 Reporting on GAO Alumni Over the years I have spent a fair amount of time on a number of hobbies, including camping, hiking, photography, and collecti\u00ad bles. Last August I enlarged my participa\u00ad tion in camping by attending the annual campout sponsored by the Denver regional office at Whiterocks Canyon Campground in the Ashley National Forest, Utah, an en\u00ad joyable experience. Retirement to Omaha was influenced at least partially by being put reasonably close to the Rocky Mountain States and the Southwest with their wonderful oppor\u00ad tunities for camping, hiking, and photog\u00ad raphy, coupled with the ability to get there rather quickly and to leave and return almost at any time I choose. Last summer I took only three trips into these areas and didn't spend as much time on these pleasurable pursuits as I would have liked. The foregoing at least gives you some of the reasons why I haven't encountered any boredom during my retirement and as I said I wish I had more time to do the things I know are out there.
