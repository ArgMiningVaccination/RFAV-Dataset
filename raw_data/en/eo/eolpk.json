Modern lifestyle, poor dietary choices, lack of physical activity, intake of sugary foods, the rise in chronic diseases and stress, frequently contribute to poor health, which leads to poor sleep, weight gain and potentially diabetes. Some of us are facing certain food allergies such as tree nuts, sea food or need to be on a gluten free diet. In recent years, facing numerous health issues, more and more people are giving up on old habits and are switching to organic and locally grown food understanding how critical nutrition foods to our health. [Nutrition and Wellness program](/services/nutrition-program) is custom tailored to the needs of each client and is proven to make a positive impact on your life! Program is based on making necessary adjustments to the existing diet based on a thorough assessment of personal health history and current diet, by getting to the root cause of your problems, such as insomnia, low energy, skin problems and hormonal issues. Food is your best medicine for many health problems. Nutrition and Wellness program is NOT a diet, it's a lifestyle change. Poor physical health can cause poor mental health and vice versa. When we look at our health we should look at the concept of body, mind and spirit as a whole in which all of the elements are connected and in which each feature affects the other. Health is an ongoing discovery process of how to integrate your entire being into achieving the utmost in wellness. It's all too often we do not recognize the importance of our health - both physical and mental - until we get an ache, a chronic condition or become awfully stressed out. Then and only then we will try to cope with the issue and if nothing works, we turn for a help from a medical professional. The bottom line is, in order to be in the best shape both physically and mentally, we need to be proactive to either staying healthy or getting back in shape. Preventive care is very effective, being proactive means more than taking the initiative. It means that we, by and large, are responsible for our own lives and the choices that we make.
