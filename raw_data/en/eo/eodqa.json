The principalpurpose of the project was to explore the potential of the newcommunications technology for the distribution of medical infor-mation to physicians in support of their clinical, research, andeducational interests.The project, whidh was begun in October 1966, embracedin its investigations the total environment within Which a bio-medical communications and information network might somedayfunction.Several researdh objectives were formulated: 1) todevelop a comprehensive, basic, and detailed appreciation of thehealth sciences community - - its nature, location, functioning,and trends; 2) to survey the status of health sciences librariesin the United States in order to ascertain the extent to whichsuch libraries can be integrated into a operative biomedicalinformation network; and 3) to identify those elements of thenew technology which may be applicable to the design of futurebiomedical information networks.The project embarked on a comprehentkive program ofinterviews, meetings, and conferences. Almost 200 persons werecontacted during the first year. More than half were M.D.'s; 2 the remainder were technicians and specialists, such as engi-neers and librarians. Interviews were conducted with generalpractitioners, specia7ists, medical researchers, and educators.Meetings were held with NIH and PHS representatives. VIsitswere made to the hospitals, medical schools, and governmentagencies, such as the Veterans Administration and the Pure Foodand Drug Administration. COnferences were arranged with medicallibrarians and with knowledgeable persons in the various medicalprofessional societies and in industry. Three EDUCOM TaskForces - - one on clinical applications of the computer to medi-cine, one of information networks, and one on continuing education =1%IN1111were briefed on the project so that they might most profitablyexpress their views and contribute constructive criticism.Furthermore, since most of the medical schools in theU.S. are at EDUCOM universities, their staffs were continuallycalled upon to furnish information and guidance to the project.Throughout the research period the project staff examined pertinentbiomedical literature and, with assistance from NLM, was able toremain abreast of new materials in the field.In.1968, the National Library of Medicine created aseparate division, dedicated to research and development, whosemission is the creation of a national biomedical communicationsand information network. During the second year, therefore, theproject worked closely with the Associate Director for Research 3 and Development and her staff, in order to ensure that the re-search data assembled by the project would support NLM's on-goingplans and programs. In this connection, EDUCOM supervised foursub-contracts designed in each instance to either test a basicassumption or develop an idea to the point of implementation.The philosophy of the project has been to understand thenature of the medical information problem in all of its ramifica-tions in order to develop the perspectives needed for planning thedesign of a network. Technology, while far from forgotten, wastemporarily set aside while the project concentrated its attentionon the question of what dhould be communicated on a medical infor-mation network, and for whom - - rather than how - - the networkshould be constructed.Our research has taught us that the world of medicalinformation is very difficult and complex in structure, and attimes it seems limitless in scope. From the standpoint of thephysician, infOrmation in medicine is clearly a multi-dimensionalproblem.It varies not only as a function of the physician'sspecialty, education, environment, and personal interests, butalso as a function of his relationdhips with his patients and asa function of time. One researcher has dramatized the physician'sdilemma by saying, \"The more patients he sees, the less he can keepup; the more he keeps up, the fewer patients he sees.\"In sum, it is important to observe that the idea of 4 automated information networks--inside or outside the medicalcommunity--is a very young concept. The project has been unableto locate examples of operating systems now in existence. Thereare,however, many organizations in the federal government and inthe private sector that are aggressively wofking toward the net-working of medical information. From the evidence gathered in themedical world, one can sense that momentum is building up for someform of multi-media networking. At some local and regional pointsplans are already in being designed to satisfy information needsspecifically expressed by individual segments of the healthsciences community. Diverse efforts toward interconnection will,in the years dhead, require leadership from the federal governmentto assist them in linking their resources together for the commongood.We Ash particularly to acknowledge the support ofEDUCOM's Committee on Continuing Medical Education which assistedin reviewing project plans and objectives; and particularly to thesub-committee on Health Sciences, under the chairmandhip of Dr.Kelly West.To them, and to the EDUCOM community at large, theproject wishes to express its grateful appreciation for theiradvice and guidance.This summary document and the research memoranda whichaccompany it constitute EDUCOM's final report to the NationalLibrary of Medicine in connection with the research activity of the 5 past two years. In addition, at the request of the ProjectOfficer, BDUCOM has also turned over its basic files of rawdata to the staff of the Lister Hill National Center for Bio-medical Communications. 6 II.THE DOMAIN OF BIOMEDICAL COMMUNICATIONSBroadly speaking, biomedical communications is the process bywhich data, information, and knowledge in the field of biomedicineare transmitted, transformed, and transferred. A loose definitionot this sort will probably suffice until the health sciencescommunity has had more experience with applied problems in themedical information world and perceives, through much more pro-found understanding of communication systems, how to work withthem.As of 1969, the need for deeper inquiry into biomedicalcommunications appears evident. Moreover, it is highly probablethat between now and the year 2000 A.D. at least 10 and possibly100 times more biomedical information will be discovered orcreated.As the size of this information base increases, the com-plexity of biomedical communications will grow -- but at an evenfaster rate than the information base.Given this broad view of the subject, the following sectionbriefly describes the realm of biomedical information and communi-cations, its special characteristics, size, problems, and currentstatus.More than any other field in the life sciences, the field ofbiomedical information is viewed from a perspective Which acknowl-edges that it deals with the domain of human experience andactivity embracing the following attributes:A.The most elementary, primitive and personal goalswhich men seek, i.e., relief from suffering ascribed to illness,13 7 the maintenance and improvement of health, and the knowledge ofthe parts, functions, and behavior of oneself and of others; B.a nearly universal and personal interest in themeans to these goals -- an interest which sustains and extendsthe traditions associated with professional medical care andscience; andC.an ever-growing number of discernible medical 1.phenomena Which attract attention, prompt theconstruction of theories, inspire research investigations, andgenerate information; 2.techniques of a mechanical, electrical, chemical,intellectual, economic, and organizational variety; 3.people, who, in every conceivable context, bothprivate and public, use biomedical information not only for tradi-tional purposes, but also in order to obtain the \"resultsu or\"outcomes\" associated with that vast range and number of abstract,collectivized, and relatively impersonal goals (e.g., defense,control, and profit) which invigorate life in its modern institu-tional settings.Taken together, these attributes of biomedicalinformation can be expressed in four ways: a.A wish for relief from that suggeriaa be-lieved to be due to an extraordinary and undesirable condition (orset of conditions) which afflicts men as individual living organismsand which limits their ability to act in desired and desirable ways. 8 b.A search for 'health - a state of optimumwell-being, given an account of one's circumstances. The studyof health values and ideals of individuals and societies indicatesthat at one time or another most human activities have been criti-cally related to the \"health\" of the individual person or to the\"public health\" of a society of Lndividuals. c.The use of remedies, treatments, and othertechniquas Which directly (as in clinical practice) or indirectly(as with laws and agencies pertaining to health) prevent or miti-gate the effects of disease and promote or encourage the attain-ment of health. d.The requirement for knowledge which, immediatelyor remotely, renders illness intelligible, health definable, andpractices effective. At the present time -- and as a result of therapid development of science and technology during the past one-hundred and fifty-years -- the types and quantities of informationWhich are accepted as biomedical frequently surpass the methodsavailable for using it, either for the realization of practicalobjectives or for the answering of scientific questions.It is when many varieties of information areused in a specific context of human events r osesand ex ecta-tions that information becomes distimatly_biomedical. In America,the concept of biomedical information refers to all that is knownand distinguished concerning the varieties of traumas, diseases, 9 and disorders; all that is known of the actions taken in dispensingand receiving preventive measures, therapies, and healing practices;and to all the findings of the empirical sciences that bear upon thestructures, functions, processes, and conditions of life.People in the health sciences share biomedical information fora variety of reasons. If investigators could clearly identify inhistorical, social-cultural, economic, political, or technologicalterms, people's reasons for sharing biomedical information, theywould be in a better position to plan for the future of biomedicalcommunications. However, this particular area of understanding isextremely subtle and elusive. While researchers have conducted*quantitative studies on the use of such sources of information aslibraries, journals, drug detailmen, symposia, and post-graduateeducation, little research has been conducted which shads any lighton the qualitative aspects of the use of informatim in medicine.We suspect that the information-sharing and ...seeking roles of thepatient, clinician, educator, and researcher differ significantly.But research has yet to reveal which specialists in health sciencesshare what types of biomedical information, and what motives leadthem to sedk and use such information.The probable need for and use made of biomedical informationamong various segments of the health sciences community may beexpressed in terms of the key people who use the information: A.The citizen-patient has at least two reasons for 10 being interested in medical information. In the first place, heis solicitous of his own health and sedks assistance when he be-lieves that his health or that of his dependents is in any waythreatened.He thus reflects the initial training in the cultureof health-care Which he has received from his family and school.Subsequently, he is likely to reflect the efforts of agents, bothpublic and private, who purvey biomedical information to himthroughout his life. These agents are as diverse as the physicianshe consults, the directors of the mass media of communications whichhe views or hears, and his own \"voice of experience\" which recordshis history, enabling him to interpret private experiences. Second,most citizen-patients expect to contribute something to the politi-cal, social, or communal processes whereby decisions are made re-garding the public aspects of health and medical practice. Forexample, as more public legislation affecting biomedicine isproposed and enacted at every level of government, the citizen-patientshould be increasingly eager to know the positions of his electedrepresentatives on various matters of health legislation. Thecitizen also has a stake in the economics of continuing healthservices, the research practices within the biomedical sphere, andthe organizational techniques employed in the conduct of suchservices and investigations. B.The practitioner-physician, dentist, nurse, and ahost of paramedical personnel are primarily interested in biomedical 11 information in the context of practice. There is a large amountof oral communication among practitioners and between practitionersand patients, for practice is geared to taking practical action inparticular cases. Practitioners are leading producers of bio-medical information. Much of the information which they use andproduce is not recorded, though practice is often conducted accord-ing to a general plan: history-taking, physical and laboratoryexaminations, treatment, and continued observation.Many medical practices are aimed at the preservation orrestoration of the health of the individual person. But not allmedical practice is case-centered. The public health officialgenerates and uses different sorts of information from those ofthe traditional practitioner, for his task is to observe, tomoderate, and at times to define the variables of community healthmeasures and practices. Though the public health practitionertends to have little direct contact with patients, his role isclosely linked with that of the citizen, the scientist, the tradi-tional practitioner, the medical administrator and the expert incommunication techniques. C.The scientist and researcher is engaged in the questfor knowledge. His purpose as biophysicist, biochemist, geneticist,physiologist, or psychologist is to discern scientific laws and togenerate theories that will allow him to demonstrate whether ornot IX is the case.\" Thus the scientist in this context is not15 12 imnediately interested in his own health, as is the patient, noris he directly concerned with the health of the members of thecommunity, as are the citizen and the public health official.2112Etima_sis_malialiy rather than of care, cure, or preventionare primary when information is organized from the vantage pointof the basic scientist.There are other features of biomedical science Whidhshould be kept in mind wten one surveys patterns of communicationamong present-day theorists. Both basic and applied research isoften carried out by teams of scientists. The efforts of scientistsWho work in applied fields are frequently linked with activitieswhich are immediately practical in nature - e.g., the physiologyof man in space is being determlned in the process of sending anastronaut to the moon; physicians are learning about the dynamicsof intracardiac blood pressures as patients are evaluated forheart surgery. Finally, it should be mentioned that oral commun-ication with fellow investigators is vital to the wofk of thescientist.According to Winch, the application of concepts inscience is influenced both, \"by the phenomena to which they areapplied and also by the fellow woekers in participation with whomthey are applied: But the two kinds of 'influence' are different.$11hem.eas it is on the basis of his observations of the phenomena (inthe course of his experiments) that he develops his concepts as hedoes, he is able to do this only by virtue of his participation in an establidhed form of activity with fellow scientists.\u00b0 (1)13 D.Health Science Administrators attempt to manage avariety of historical and social institutions -- professionalorganizations, clinical facilities, rdsearch corporations,communications networks, and government agencies through theexercise of legitimate authority in prescribed areas of jurisdiction.The administrator must be a good communicator if he is to exercisea measure of control over the performances of subordinates, notoffend the public Which his agency serves, and remain responsiveto the directives of superiors.The administrator's work affects large numbers ofprofessional personnel and patients. His need for biomedical in-formation, therefore, is selfi-evident. Unless he remains contin-ually alert to new developments, and thoroughly conversant withmedical trends and progress, the organizational entity for whichhe is responsible -- hospital, foundation, or research institute --will function at less than full effectiveness.E.Information and communication experts inhabit thebiomedical field for a number of different reasons. Some, suchas medical sociologists, study how communications in biomedicinedo in fact occur. Others devise schemes which suggest how commun-ications (especially of the mechanical-electronic type) could orshould occur - e.g., systems designers and computer engineers. (1) Winch,Peter.The Idea of a Social Science, New York:Humanities Press, 1958, p. 86. 14 Still others traffic directly in the day-to-day tasks of producing,handling, and processing knowledge -- librarians, publishers, docu-mentalists, and producers of audio-visual aids. There are otherswho occasionally list themselves as communications experts -- e.g.,medical educators exploring the use of teaching machines and anassortment of medical publicists. It may be noted that the newcircuits, both social and electronic, are colorful, exciting, andnewswonthy.The greatest changes in biomedical communications willoccur as the new technologies prove themselves useful in the contextof the goals and purposes of patients, practitioners, scientists, andmedical administrators.Thus the biomedical information area is a specialdomain of human affairs identifed at any given time by those people,engaged in complex patterns of associations, who give meaning tothe conditions and processes we have described as health and diseaseand to the actions which have been called treatment, prevention, andthe quest for knowledge. There is little reason to believe that thecentral meanings or importance of the realm will change in the nearfuture; individuals and groups will continue: to have requirementsfor the maintenance of health, to suffer diseases and traumas, todesire remedies, treatments, and preventive measures, and to attemptto broaden and deepen their knowledge in all these matters. It isthis understanding of the current situation that indicates that thebusiness of biomedical communication is not new and that it involvesthe problems of sharing and of failing to share untold volumes of18 15 information emerging from a great number of disciplines. It hasbeen noted that the forms of information which are communicatedmay be quite simple or extremely complex, concrete or abstract,primitive or highly rationalized, and intensely personal as wellas highly impersonal. It has been acknowledged that numerousdevices are used in communicating biomedical information. Furtheradvances in science and technology should permit the design ofnew devices which may be engineered to meet nearly any specifica-tion that is suggested in the future. In regard to these latterdevelopments, it may be expected that the basic forms of bio-medical information which were distinguidhed earlier in thissection, through which and about which communications are made,will not change. They will, however, certainly be elaborated andcompounded as new communications technologies become available. 16 III.BACKGROUND FOR BCN SYSTEM DESIGNERSForming an appreciation of the basic precepts of medicine isan essential prerequisite to planning a biomedical information andcommunications network for the health sciences community. Thischapter aims to provide that background. While much of what itpresents may be familiar to the practicing medical professional,the information included here is to assist the computer specialist,the communications technician, the librarian, the informationscientist, the systems designer, and others who plan supportingroles in the health sciences community or who are otherwise con-cerned with understanding the medical environment.The material in this chapter is organized by the componentof the Center for Biomedical Communications to which the contentmost directly applies. It consists mainly of summaries of thehighlights of more comprehensive studies which are included asResearch Memoranda with this report. The Research Memoranda them-selves represent the results of collaborative effort between theEDUCOM research staff and one or more individuals in the medicalworld who served as consultants. The Memoranda are generallyquite detailed and include supporting bibliographies and references.(In certain instances where a particular original report was rea-sonably brief, the entire content has been placed in this Chapterrather than attadhed as an Appendix.) 17 Following NLM Board of Regents action in 1968, the EDUCOMresearch staff was directed to give priority to the developmentof the Specialized Education component. This direction resultedin the preparation of a unique compendium of medical schoolextra-mural programs found in Research Memorandum 8.Also, it dhould be noted that the memoranda relating to theData Processing and Data Transmission Component are generallyapplicable to the interests of all other components of the BCNbecause of obvious functional inter-relationships. 18 LIBRARY SERVICES COMPONENT -Composed of four levels of network participation: 1.Center for 1.Bibliographic listings 2.Access to the literature 3.Response to forinformation ( CBC Technical DevelopmentPlan June 1968 ) 19 RM 1SOME REFLECTIONS ON THE HISTORYOF BIOMEDICAL COMMUNICATIONS The vital question in setting up a Biomedical Communica-tions Network is whether the user for whom it is intended willin fact use it. This report underlines the innate conservatismof the medical profession and its distrust of governmentalregulation. This report traces communication back to the time when itwas all by word of mouth. When writing was developed, few couldbenefit since most were illiterate; in any case the records ofmedicine were kept secret as its practice was a secret art con-trolled by the priests. Furthermore, as the method of makingcheap multiple copies was not invented until the 15th Century,in many cases there was only one copy of works p.coduced earlier. The invention of printing led to the scientific journal andto the development of the forerunner of the present-day medicallibrary.Learned societies exchanged publications, but alreadyin the 18th Century readers were complaining cf the difficulty ofkeeping up.In the 19th Century the abstract journal was created;but the need for some guide to the literature had become evidentbefore that.Albrecht von Haller, a Swiss, had begun publishing *We have referred to the various Research Memoranda throughout this sumnary as RM 1, RM 2, etc. These same Research Memoranda also have the date of publication added in some references, i.e., RM-169. Thus, RM 1 is identical to RM-169.23 20 medical bibliographies in 1747; but others were not eager toundertdke the immense work involved. One of the exceptions wasa Dane called Callisen, whose 33 volumes give excellent coverageof.the last half of the 18th and the first third of the 19thCenturies.The first secretary of the Smithsonian Institutiontried to interest the regents in 1855 to compile an extensivebibliography of science. Although he failed to persuade them,the task was taken up by the Royal Society of London, which wasto publish complete coverage of the 19th Century,. Only an authorindex was issued, and the First World War effectively stopped anyfurther work on it.In medicine, however, John Shaw Billings had issued a catalogof monographs in 1872 and followed it up in 1879 with IndexMedicus, for current awareness, and in 1880 with the first volumeof the Index Catalogue, for retrospective search.The Index Cataloque survived until 1961, but over the years,delays in publication time led scientists to explore faster meansof making the literature available. In the Second World War, aweekly listing of medical literature known as the Current List wascirculated to serving physicians and first microfilm, and laterphotocopies of articles were supplied on request. The microfilmcopy distribution service was responsive to the information needsof physicians who, during the war years, were widely scatteredthroughout the world. Physicians not only received copies of24 21 articles but were also provided with a hand optical viewer. Thisis one of the earliest examples of network distribution of medicalinformation to bridge the communications gap between medical re-search and practice. More recently computerization has made itpossible for the listings of periodical articles (Index Medicus)and monographs (Current Catalog) to become more current and hencemore useful.The report then deals with the information position in agri-culture, and contrasts the vast strides which have been made inthis area in transmitting research results to the practicing farmerwith the very slow progress in medicine. As far back as 1862, whenthe Department of Agriculture (USDA) was first created, the MorrillLand-Grant College Act was passed, which created the first link ina direct communication chain from the federal and state governmentsto the farmer in the field. The Hatch Act of 1887 provided grantsto states to support experiment stations for agricultural researchand development. There was nothing like this in medicine. In 1914,county agents, operating from the experiment stations, were author-ized to advise farmers on agricultural matters. Thus scientificinformation from the laboratory was rapidly disseminated at theplace and time it was needed.The new communication modalitieswere early exploited: in 1920 market newi was transmitted byradio in Morse, and the next year saw the establishment of a regularprogram for farmers broadcast from the world' s first broadcasting station2 22 in Pittsburgh.This was followed, in 1928, by a nationwideagricultural program, broadcast from Chicago. In 1946 a regulartelevision program for farmers was inaugurated in Sdhenectady.This was all backed up by massive infusions of instruction andliterature.Farm equipment manufacturers had provided instructionand literature since 1910, while instruction in livestock im-provement was started by packing companies in 1917, and in betterseed-handling methods by seed companies in the 1930's. The reportascribes the tremendous progress in agriculture to its communi-cation network, based on 72 land-grant universities and colleges,53 experiment stations, 6000 county agents, 95,000 4 H Clubs(which encourage scientific agriculture among farm youth), 120,000USDA employees, and 50 state departments of agriculture with informa-tion outlets in the form of over 700 farm journals and newspapers,1000 radio stations, 400 television stations,and 200 farm organi-zations.The lessons for the Biomedical Communications Network areclear; but how is the doctor to be persuaded to abandon his long-time conservatism?New ways of packaging and disseminating knowledge to the medicalprofession are needed to insure that the practitioner of the futurehas the information he needs when he needs it and, as new infor-mation is generated.RM 1 provides perspective for the BCN systems designer in the Library Services Component. It is a prefatory statement con-cerning the historical development of the field of medicallibraries and communications. Included are vignettes of pastfailures and successful attempts to make the information contentof medical literature more directly available to the practicingphysician, and the medical researcher and educator. 2723 24 RM 2HEALTH SC/ENCELIBRARIES TODAY, The purpose of Health Science Libraries Today (see RM 2)is to present a picture of the nature and extent Of biomedicalcommunications as it occurs in the medical world through insti-tutional libraries and information centers. It is a factualstudy prepared for the systems designer of the resources anddhortcomings of existing health science libraries and an eval-uation of their effects on the national health effort. Inaddition, the report includes a suggested plan for interconnect-ing health sciences libraries into a biomedical communication network.During the past 15 years, a number of surveys have beenmade of health science libraries.Most of these focused on theactivities of libraries at medical sdhools. In recent years,however, special surveys were conducted of institutional librariesin fields allied with medicine--hospital libraries, nursinglibraries, and others.Despite these reviews, there masts very little informationabout the basic dharacteristics of medical libraries and evenless about the standards by Which their value to the field ofmedicine is measured. This report.therefore is designed topresent a more complete understanding of the relationships health 25 sciences libraries have to the full domain of medical experienceand practice.There is no doubt that health sciences libraries will playan active and probably innovating role in the development of thenational biomedical communications network. Traditionally, theselibraries have represented the primary sources of medical infor-mation and their roots are deeply embedded in the educational andresearch processes of all the health professions.For this reason it is essential to develop as comprehensivea view as possible of the health sciences library community.Advance knowledge of the location of health sciences libraries,their geographic distribution, their facilities, their collections,their use of the new media, their clientele, and their cooperativeundertakings is a prerequisite to network planning.RM 2 offers the most comprehensive review of the subject tobe presented in a long while. It provides a quantitative summaryof medical library facts, an analytical review of function andservices, and a very complete bibliography. It reveals thathealth sciences libraries are unevenly distributed across thecountry, with numerous and rich collections concentrated in themetropolitan centers while other areas are virtually devoid ofbiomedical information services. It points out that facilities,where they exist, are limited, and, that most health scienceslibraries have outgrown their physical quarters. It indicatesaa that few, health science libraries have developed long-range programs embracing the newer media. And it exposes the need for much greater cooperation and communication among health sciences libraries if they are expected to function as an \"infor- mation community\u00b0 in support of medical research, education, and practice.These findings of course antedate the Medical LibraryAssistance Act (1965), Which was designed to remedy some of the above mentioned ills; but its benefits are yet to be felt. RM 2 makes it crystal-clear that medical libraries can and should be- come an important element in a national biomedical communications network.To do so, however, they must be strengthened andsupported on a continuing basis for some time to come.Of special interest in the report is a description of howhealth science libraries meet and support the information needs of practicing physicians, physicians with teaching responsibilities,research-oriented physicians, blomedical scientists, medicalstudents, paramedical personnel, and other individuals Who functionas part of theallied health professions. For each of these usersthe repbrt sets forth a vignette of their interaction with sourcesof medical information.Because a future biomedical communications network willundoubtedly strive to taerve individuals directly, the reportplaces considerable emphasis on the.information habits and needs26 of the practicing physician. Interview mere conducted with a30 27 number of general practitioners and specialists with the objectof obtaining greater insight into their information-seeking be-havior, and a detailed treatment of their responses is includedas a supplement to the report. In particular, EDUCOM wanted tolearn in greater detail about the information sources Whidhpracticing physicians routinely consult during a typical workingday and what, if any, retrospective use they make of the library.From these interviews, the report concludes that a definite re-quirement exists to increase the responsibilities of tomorrow'smedical library network so that it can play a more practical andmore active role in providing information directly to practitioners.Since pre-Christian times it has been true that physicianswho wanted to use a library effectively had to visit it personally.However, the ever-accelerating tempo of the twentieth century islikely to deny the physician this opportunity because of lack of time.This trend will probably continue rather than abate.Consequently, it is appropriate to consider establishing some newcommunication channel between physician and library that willallow medical information to be conveyed to his office or home ina timely and efficient way. While recent advances in electricalcmmunications have made such communications technically feasible,is not y t clear what information should be transmitted overthese channels or how the telecommunications network dhould beorganized in order to make the library' s total information31 28 resources most available to the physician. The interviews shedconsiderable light on these unknowns and the reader's attentionis invited to the basic data (see RM 2, Appendix B).Even though the intervieum constituted a very small sampleof physician reaction, they quidkly established an informationdichotomy which is likely to be maintained in the future, namely,that the nature of physician information needs can be classed asbeing immediate and continuing. Dr. William H. Stewart, SurgeonGeneral of the United States Public Health Service, spedking on\"Health and the New Technology\" at EDUCOles Conference on Education-al Communications at Duke University in 1966, stressed the differ-ence between the two needs when he said, \"I am particularlyconcerned about...the practitioner of medicine, Who is at the endof the line ,whose job is one that (relies on a) minute-by-minute need for information which he can't predict he will need ata particular moment.\" About the physician's continuing need forinformation he said, \"[the physicians] are also responsible in large partfor communicating with the oncoming generation [of medicalpractitioners] in their own like who are going to communicate withone another and they need the information for this purpose.\"Immediate refers to the kinds of information a physiciannormally obtains from desk handbooks, pharmaceutical looseleafservice, county health department releases, drug detail nen, thepoison control network, person-to-person communication, and soforth.It is \"hard\" information and it is immediately useful to3 2 29 him in patient care. It is information that he needs all daylong and which he trusts will be current and accurate. Continuinginformation, on the other hand, can best be described as theclassical literature a physician is accustomed to using When heconsults bibliographic sources in the library. It includes thejournals, the monographs, and the society publications which formthe professional foundation for all medical knowledge. Althoughthe practicing physician may refer only infrequently to thissource for immediate information, it in no way affects his generalview of the library as an indispensdble source in the medicalresearch and educational process.Systams analysts planning a biomedical communications networkcan learn mudh from direct interviews with practicing physicians.Such interviews are highly educational and they inject realism andpracticality into systems design. A few hours in a doctor's officevery quickly gives the interviewer a \"feel\" for the kind offunctional system which will truly help the practicing physiciando his job.From RM 2, and other sources, EDUCOM has graduallybuilt up the following description of the practicing physician andh4s reliance on information:The practicing physician may first and foremost be char-acterized as the man \"with little time\".He usually has alarge and busy practice and makes hospital rounds, and, insome cases, bouse calls. Time is short, and his informationneeds, critical as they may be, cannot compete with time3 3 30 devoted to patients. He sees drug detailmen during his busyday and considers them an important source of information onnew drugs.Drug firms inundate him with free material,brochures, house organs, and the like, and he feels that hemust read most of this material to be informed on currentmedications.He subscribes to journals, (usualiy betweenfour and ten titles), and reads these when he can to \"keepup\".When he is baffled by a diagnostic problem, he picksup the telephone to call a colleague whom he trusts. Some-times, when he finds a review of a book that is critical aswell as descriptive and tells him something about the book,he buys it.He relies heavily on a number of handbooks, themost important of which is Physicians Dedk Reference. Thisvolume, published annually, and supplemented quarterly,supplies him with information on drug names, dosages, sideeffects, and the like.He attends what meetings he can, mostly out of town, sothat he can devote his attention entirely to what is beingpresented,and does not have to worry about the omnipresenttelephone.Sometimes, when he feels that he needs to readsomething more than is presented in his journals, he goes toa nearby library. As a rule he is not aware of the variousindexes or abstracts beyond those he used in medical school.Current Contents, Science Citation Index and the variouscontinuing bibliographies and specialized abstracts are not34 31 known to him.He often continues to rely on the library ofthe medical school from which he graduated, but if he hasmoved to another area, he does not always realize that hecan use the nearest medical library there. While in thehospital he may drop into the hospital library, but he mayfind that what he needs is not there. The farther away heis from library resources, the less likely he is to think ofthem as an information source.He generally feels that he keeps up as best he can, andthat his information needs are reasonably well met. Hecomplains of the multitude of printed materials that comeacross his desk; \"separating the chaff from the wheat\" is atime-consuming tadk and he wishes that somebody would do itfor him.He would particularly like more review articles;current, concise, and presenting only the best writing. Whenbe learns of the various selective dissemination techniquesavailable, either on a manual or automated basis, he feelsthat a service such as this, tailormade for him, would beextremely important, would save his precious time, and would,he hopes, perform the evaluative function for the literaturewhich he desires.He believes in the importance of continuing education forpracticing physicians but his reaction to semdnars and meetingsis varied; some are too theoretical for him to be of immediate25 3 2 value, although he recognizes that theory ought to be part'of the continuing education function. When given a choice,he prefers the practical approach, in seminar form; there hecan ask questions and benefit from the discussions of thegroup. The average physician in the United States is a solo, privatepractitioner who owns his office,, employs one or two assistants, isaffiliated with one or two local hospitals, sees a total of 110patients per week, 91 in his office, 18 in the hospital, and one athome, wofks 50 to 64 hours per week, has a net profit of $26,680,an operating overhead of 60% to 70%, faces an improving financialsituation but a rising overhead, faces a slight improvement inphysician-to-population ratio, and is considering joining two ormore local physicians in group practice.The economics of medical practice and the level of paramedicalsupport vary according to institutional affiliation. Solo and grouppractitioners divide their time betumen office and hospital. Clinicphysicians are full-time employees and do not engage in privatepractice.Teaching associates practice in offices provided by thehospital.The pattern of physician behavior also varies as a function ofsolo or team practice and generalization or specialization. Forexample, Mayo Clinic and Cleveland Clinic advocate team approachesto diagnosis.Mayo and Cleveland are also predominantly referral 33 centers.The University of Minnesota and Kaiser Permanente inOakland, California, have introduced screening techniques andare now training medical interviewers who will specialize in in-terpreting screening information.Information used by a physician is developed through thediagnostic method. It is this process that sets the first rulefor the design of a system to serve physicians.In 1963 Crombie(1) described the computer in the diagnosticprocess as a store of estimates of the probabilities that givensymptoms will be associated with specific diseases. In that sameyear, Engle and Davis(2)wrote a series of papers on the past,present, and future of medical diagnosis.

For new information on medications,diagnoses, therapy, and patient care techniques he depends strongly on colleagues and others who have had clinical experience with that information.The physician belongs to one or two colleges or boards servinghis area of medical interest, reads their publications, and supple-ments this intake by attending lectures arranged through the hospitalto which he belongs or through the local medical society. For asubscription costing $70 a year he can receive commercially produced audio tapes.If he is not a surgeon or anesthesiologist and is ina metropolitan or near a metropolitan area he may view special TVbroadcasts of medical lectures. The courses that he does attendare short, concentrated bursts of instruction designed to fit inhis practice schedule. (4)Rubenstein, Alburt H., Gustave J. Rath, Richard W. Trueswell,and David J. Werner, Proc am of Research on the Manaqement ofResearch Department of Industrial Engineeringand Management Sciences, Northwestern University, Evanston,Illinois, October 1966. This paper is based on a talk presentedat the Twentieth National Conference on the Administration ofResearch held October 26-28, 1966, at Miami Beach, Florida. 3 5 Experimental medical techniques, advanced clinical or animalresearch, and advances in tutorial methods are treated casuallyby the practitioner. His immediate interest is in clinicallyconfirmed medical experiences. The fact that these experiencesare not analytically and rigorously controlled is not so importantto him as to his colleagues in the allied sciences of biology andchemistry.These data are heavily pictorial in content and narrative inform.The narrations are designed to provide the physician\"withextensive descriptions and therefore, a vicarious appreciation ofthe information.Some primary rules can be developed from the knowledge ofinformation-seeking behavior of physicians. The information systemserving the private practitioner must be based on a request-to-response design attitude. The total transfer function of thesystem must include all facets of the turnaround cycle, includingthe search and retrieval function, the location of information, thetransfer of the request to that data location, the determinationof data availability, and then delivery to the requester.The system must accommodate data in all forms and of alllengths.Versatility of handling is a key design requirement.The Biomedical communications Network must handle a variety ofdata forms and multiple length messages. It can be assumed thata number of communication media will be used. There will be three 36 basic message forms: 1) A direct response; 2) a call back; and3) a mail back.A well-structured file, a distinct inquiry, and a short replywill be handled within a three-minute period. Some poison inquirieswill be direct xeply messages. Not all poison inquiries will fallinto this category and the more complex may be referred to a lab-oratory.\"Mail back\" replies will typically include materials,such as films, which are not easily transmitted.The aggregate system will be an expanding intermingling ofinformation sources and physician users. Each primary source usedby a physician will have a complete system information directory.The directory will be similar to a union list. The directory willbe supported by a circulation control record which will notify therequester of data availability. In the event of nonavailabilitythe request will be switched over to a second source. That sourcewill transmit the data to the user. The expanding network willextend from user-to-source, from source-to-second source, and fromuser-to-umer.The network will include multiple media of multiple lengthlocated at various centers. A spirit of cooperation betweenparticipating institutions and a certain degree of commitmentmust precede the establishment of such a network. Although nosystems now handle such a variety of data, there are examples ofnetworks which illustrate the trend in cooperative ventures. 37 In sum, the excursions to physician's offices demonstratedthat there are certain reference information-type services whicha biomedical communications network can provide directly to thephysician in order to help him conserve his professional timeand thus allow him to see more patients. RM 2 ends with theconclusion that health science libraries should be consideredcharter members of any future biomedical information system de-signed to serve the practicing physician. It recommends ahierarchical relationship among health science libraries througha network configuration consisting of primary libraries (thelibrary available locally to the physician); district libraries(of medium size and serving many primary libraries); reservoirlibraries (serving the needs of a region with a comprehensivecollection and larger services to support education and research);and the National Library of Medicine as the apex of the pyramid).The network of libraries proposed in the report is highlyuser-oriented. It is based not only on a quantitative and quali-tative analysis of the different types of users and their geo-graphical location, but alo on the use of new channels ofcommunication, and on methods for obtaining feedbadkfrom usersto make any future biomedical information network more and moreresponsive.41 38 RM 3SURVEY OF INTERLIBRARYCOMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS Interlibrary communications describes the nature of electronicand other communications methods and practices that have been usedduring the past 15 years. It provides the Biomedical CommunicationsNetwork with hard information about the experience of others en-gaged in the planning of more effective communication between andamong libraries. Written in the form of a bibliographic essay,RM 3 traces the development of computer and communications techno-logy in cooperative library systems and, in the process, givesspecial emphasis to the experience of medical libraries.A variety of different communication forms are highlighted.They range from the simplest use of the U.S. mails up to the tele-phone, teletype, radio, and even remote access computer-operatedsystems.Each historical vignette is supported by a bibliographyand detailed substantiating facts.Of all of the different kinds of aquipment used by librariesfor interlibrary communications, the one which has received widestacceptance for its practical value and immediate usefulness is theteletype machine.The earliest use of the teletype machine in libraries took -place in 1927 at the Free Library of Philadelphia. The machinewas part of a closed circuit teletype system used for communicatingbook request information from the loan desk to the stacks and viceversa.Following World War II, the first installation connecting 39 two distant libraries was established between the MilwaukeePublic Library and the Racine Public Library in Wisconsin.Racine's limited collection was considered inadequate to thedemands of its patrons and, rather than increase the book budgetsignificantly, its Director negotiated an access arrangement withthe larger collection at Milwaukee via teletype. Daily messengerservice was instituted bmtween the two libraries to effect pick-up and delivery of library materials.The teletype machine enabled the libraries to use the speedof the telephone with the authority of the printed word. Thisadvantage continues today and is the one Which is mainly responsiblefor the proliferation of teletype communications. Teletype communi-cations between and among libraries are beginning to emerge in bothinformal and formal network coafigurations. In addition to theirobvious application to interlibrary loan, teletype has also beenused to augment library holdings on a reciprocal basis to providefor general communications with other libraries, to serve as achannel for querying union catalogs, to accommodate referencequestions and services, and to handle internal communications.,Mathin the past few years, Warren Bird at the Medical Library,Mike University, established the protocols for a teletype inter-library loan network which connects six medical libraries with theNational Library of Medicine. Mr. Bird produced a proceduresmanual to govern the use and operation of the network and alsoadapted the American Library Association's Interlibrary Loan Code44 to the communication processes.40 Perhaps the most important benefit to accrue to users ofmedical library teletype service is the immediate ability itprovides to communicate with any other teletype user anyWhere inthe world.Thus, it becomes possible for any participant in theDuke teletype network to communicate reference inquiries to infor-mation points outside the formal network. As reference demandsincrease, it is likely that medical libraries will begin to makewider use of the teletype machine even though it may have beeninitially acquired for an entirely different purpose. In addition,expanded uses in the future are a virtual certainty 1-oth becauseof the low cost of teletype operation and'the technical improve-ments in the equipment itself.In general, RM 3 reveals that, although the advantages ofadvanced means of communications have been known to medical librariesfor many years, their utilization has been retarded by questions ofcost and systems planning. Implicit in the report's conclusion,however, is that the development of computer and communicationstechnology and of regional and national library network programs,when combined Wlth the day to day pressure for increasing services,will cause libraries to devise more effective ways of applyingcommunications technology so as to facilitate interinstitutionalservices.44 41 RM 4RATIONALE AND NODE SELECT-ION FOR INITIAL PHASE OF BCN This report further develops the discussion of the LibraryServices Component of the Biomedical Communications Network. Anessential step in the planning of a communications network isdeveloping acceptable rationale for selecting the individualnodes Which will comprise the net. This step can only be taken,however, after the role and functions of each component of thenetwork are clearly defined and well understood. Thus RM 4 setsout (a) to identify the library functions and activities to beconsidered in planning, (b) to classify existing facilities ascandidates for inclusion as nodes in the system, (c) to suggestminimal requirements for participation, (d) to estimate the man-power, resources, and cost implications, and (e) to outline ageneral plan for implementing the initial phase of Developmentof the Library Services Component. RM 4 specifies the libraryactivities to be included and selects specific libraries forparticipation in the initial phase. The proposed BiomedicalCommunications Network (BCN) is defined in the report as a setof libraries, selected by NLM, and Interconnected by electroniclinks primarily to afford wide access to computerized user ser-vices or support services now available at only a few institutions.Included in RM 4 is a chart developed for the national surveyof medical school libraries detailing user services, and anotherlisting support services performed for one library by another. 42 Direct user services, performed for patrons of that library, aredifferentiated from indirect user services performed for another library.A user service corresponds to a specific request, whilesupport services cover a wide spectrum of general services withno one-to-one relationship.An hierarchical model, based approximately on the four le7elsof libraries envisioned in the Technical Development Plan, and in-cluding the users, is presented. Quantitative data are at presentavailable only for \"on demand\" provision of specified documents:for the total volume of service requests, Which could be more use-ful in estimating the computer and commmnications capability re-quired at each level, data are not at present available.The model estimates the number of elements at each level.Level 1 is the national facility (TUM), Level 2 comprises the 10regional facilities, Level 3 the 100 subregional facilities, andLevel 4 the 1000 local facilities (closer to 10,000 if all documentcollections called libraries are included). There are 100,000potential users, (closer to one million if nurses, dentists, andallied health professionals are included). For each level theW.rect and indirect demands are stated, expressed as a mean numberper element, and as a ratio.The model does not take into account the fact that some regionshave no Level 2 facility and that in such a region a consortium ofLevel 3 facilities may be approved as the regional library (e.g., 43 East Central RegionMichigan, Ohio, and Kentudky). Where aLevel 2 facility exists, the role of Level 3 facilities has notbeen defined; in other words the system seems to be evolving asa three-level one, rather than as a four-level one.Minimal requirements for BCN nodes at each level are thenpresented, in terms of budgets, materials, service tools andstaff.Tentative budgets of $300,000 for Level 2, $30,000 forLevel 3, and $3,000 for Level 4 facilities are postulated. Inmaterials, Level 2 is seen as having more fhan 2,500 currentserials and, generally, more than 100,000 books; Level 3 morethan 250 current serials and over 10,000 books; and Level 4 morethan 2\"el.s.?ntial' current serials and over 1,000 books. Inservice tcols, Level 2 is pictured as having all \"standard\"document, citation, and answer service tools; Level 3 the \"major\"ones:,nd Level 4 the \"essential\" ones. In staff, Level 2 isexpected to have over 10 full-time professionals with, usually,an equal number of clerical and technical staff; Level 3 morethan quarter time of an \"adequately\" Oper-ational definitions of \"adequate\", \"essential,\" \"major,\" \"minimal,\"and \"standard,\" are not although they will surely need tobe developed.The functional rcle for Leval 2 is to provide indirectservices and support sw:;ices to an NLM-designated multistatearea (estimated at ltr Level 3 facilities, 100 Level 4 facilities,and 10,000 users), and direct services to users ladking other 44 facilities.Level 3 is to provide similar indirect serviceseither to a specific geographic area or to a specific group ofLevel 4 facilities (generally 10 facilities and 1000 users) andsometimes some direct services (as at Level 2), While Level 4 isseen as providing direct services to its own user population andlimited system services to other Level 4 facilities in the area.In a series of tables, facilities in regions with approvedor funded programs as of October 1, 1968, are classified at thevarious levels and compared with the previously specifieC minimalrequirements for BCN nodes. These regions are I (New England),II (New York), III (Mid-Eastern), IV (Mid-Atlantic), V (EastCentral), VII (Mid-West), and X (Pacific Northwest). Data giveninclude, for Level 2 facilities: name, number of interlibraryloans per year, automation plans, and Whether the facility has TWX(rable A).For Level 3 facilities: total number in each region,libraries of health science schools being in Table B, and librariesof medical societies, hospitals, and other organizations (sub-divided into profit and non-profit) in Table C; for each healthscience school facility, the name,median borrowing time, annualnumber of interlibrary loans, number of professional staff, auto-mation plans, and availability of TWX are noted. For the otherfacilities, the type, the name, the location, the number of serialsubscriptions, the number of professional staff, and the availabi-lity of TWX are included. Table D has an estimate of the number 45 of hospital libraries in the same regions which would probablymeet Level 4 requirements. Data given include: the number ofAmerican Hospital Association (AHA) members, the number accreditedby AHA, the number approved for residency training, the numberaffiliated with a medical school, and estimates of the number withlibraries, of the number of libraries with staff, and of the numberof librarians requesting interlibrary loans (taken as the criterionof whether the library is \"adequately\" staffed). A forthcomingAHA survey should provide more accurate data.Libraries of sdhools of nursing and of other allied healthprofessions were not Considered in the report; these would numberseveral hundred. The biomedical document resources of largegeneral libraries were also not taken into account. Some groupsof users have special problems. Dentists, for example, are a verylarge group with no institutional base, who need to be providedwith at least \"remote\" access to system resources.In order to select priority functions in the initial phase,four questions had to be answered affirmatively: 1.Can current technology materially improve the functioneither by makirg services now enjoyed by few availableto many or by making possible services not otherwisefeasible? 2.Are the hardware and software either available now, orso far evolved that modest developmental effort canresult at least in pilot operations within two years?3.Does the function involve eiiher a very large volumeof transactions, or a widely expressed user want?49 46 4.Does the function represent a bottleneck limiting ex- pansion of other services, or is it closely coupled with other functions so that improvement in volume or quality will have a major impact on these other functions?The user service functions selected for top priority are(=Limbered as in RM 4):1A:Padkaged \"Level 5\" facilities managed as branches of Level 2 or Level 3 facilities, Which would supply small hospitals with a basic collection,maintain this collection, and provide staff- medicated document, citation, and answer services via no-toll phone lines.1B:No-toll 2-way voice channels between users with no institutional facility (especially dentists) and staff at BCN node.IC:Hierarchy-dictated 2-way channels among nodes for interlibrary requests and service output.1D(2): On-line computer searches of MEDLARS and multifiles.1G(1): Batchedrecurrent computer searches of MEDLARSfiles on individual profiles.1H:On-line and batched computer searches of multi- files.All support services were listed to receive top priority.They are:2A(1): Computer files of regional (all Level 2 and 3)holdings data.2A(2): Computer files of combined holdings/availabilitydata.2B:Decentralized cataloging input to NLM files and remote on-line query.2C:Remote processing of \"housekeeping\" records and management data.For the top priority functions, suggestions are also made onthe levels which should be operational ro those which Should operate 47 as pilots.Certain other user service functions were listed,but not given top priority. These were:1D(1): Batched computer searches of MEDLARS files.1E:On-line computer searches of multifiles. 1F:Batched recurrent computer searches of MEDLARSfiles on group profiles.1G(2): Batched recurrent computer searches of multi-files on individual profiles.11:On-line computer searches of multifiles.1J:Computer-aided instruction fo.: teaching use ofinformation resources.1K:Transmissio,1 of document contents (telefacsimile,etc.).Criteria of selection for initial phase involvement included:(a) locating a BCN node that has a regional medical library fundedor approved and (b) is able to meet minimal requirements of func-tional responsibility. Taking into consideration (c) funding limi-tations,(d) need for concentrating resources, and (e) buildinglower-level nodes where higher-level nodes are already operating,the report suggests that not more than two regions should beinvolved in the initial phase. Region II(Nova York) and Region V(East Central) are selected for involvement, since, in New York,the State University of New York (SUNY) already has a functioningnetwork which could participate less expensively than any other,and, in Region V, a consortium-type regional medical library (Level3) will provide a good woeking environment for pilot projects atLevel 4.The report concludes by recommending specific implementa-Sition of BCN projects f r the first phase in these two regions. 48 RM 5INITIAL PHASE DEVELOPMENT pFTHE LIBRARY COMPONENT OF THE BCN This report addresses itself to five tasks:1.To elicit information feedback from selected leaders in the biomedical library community regarding the rationale and plan for node selection recommended in the earlier study (RM 4).2.To develop an approach for estimating probable traffic flow among BCN nodes.3.To define, in greater detail, the role of nodes at each level.4.To prepare a \"strawman agreement\" outlining the obligations and responsibilities that nodes might be expected to assume if they are to pal:ti- cipate in the BCN.5.To identify further tasks that must be accomplish- ed to implement the initial phase of the BCN.To obtain feedback from medical libraries, six were chosen,the Countway Library, the Upstate Medical Center of the StateUniversity of New York, the New York Academy of Medicine, WayneState Medical School, the College of Physicians of Philadelphia,and the Welch Medical Library of Baltimore.Four of them haveprimary responsibility for an NLM approved or funded RegionalMedical Library program. Of the two who have not, one was chosenas a \"disinterested!' party, the other as the foremost pioneer ofnetworking.The six were sent a copy of the Rationale and Node Selectionplan and reactions were obtained by interview.Only minor changesZ2 49 have been suggested, particularly in regard to the criteria set for minimal budget and resource requirements; no major criticismwas voiced, even with regard to the controversial choice of regionsfor implementation. This general concurrence gave tentative assur-ance that the plan was sound and ready for further exposure to int- erested parties.The basic approach to estimating possible traffic flow was theuse of available data on current service demand to predict thetotal messages that will have to be handled in the demonstrationregions.The report points out that such data is scarce and incom-plete.Interlibrary loan figures provide the only available data. Onthe basis of a survey made in Region III (Mid-Eastern), the annualnumber of requests to NLM is known, as is an estimate of borrowingfrom all sources. Hence a figure can be obtained for the proportionof NLM requests to total borrowing. Using a corrected form of this,estimates of total borrowing in other regions can be derived fromthe number of requests made to NLM by that region, assuming thatthe proportion of NLM to total borrowing is the same in all regions(Table 1, RM5). This obviously does not hold for Region IV (Itid-Atlantic), and it is further assumed that NLM pxovides 50% of theloans in this region. When this correction is made, total borrow-ing is estimated at 910,000 requests.Table 2 of the report relatesthe demand in the various regions to parameters such as percentage of practicing MD's, of approved residencies, of AMA-accreditedhospitals, of medical school,affilial:ed hospitals, and of PM'research and training funds. Good correlation suggests that thr,assumptions underlying this method of estimation are essentiallyvalid.Further Predictions are then made on the distribution ofdemand at various levels, using Region II (New York) as theexample; a ten percent annual increase is assumed.This gives abase of 194,000 total requests for Fiscal 1970.Fifteen percentof these will be generated at Level 3, the remainder at Level 4.Level 2 will then receive all Level 3 requests (assuming no inter-connection between same-level nodes) and those requests from Level4 unsatisfied by Level 3, assumed to be 10%.This means thatLevel 3 to Level 2 channels will carry 45,000 requests in all oraverage about 1000 to 2000 requests per channel, depending on thenumber of nodes. Similarly the channels between Levels 3 and 4will carry about 165,000 requests assuming several hundred Level4 nodes.If the regional library can supply better than 85% ofthe requests, this would mean a maximum of 7000 passed on to LevelI (NLA).Very tentative estimates are also made of the demand for theuser and support services listed in Table 6 of the earlier study(RM 4).These must: necessarily be tentative since there are nostudies on which to base the estimates.Interlibrary loan is theonly measure for which detailed figures exist.50 51 The role of nodes at each level has been defined further interms of consumer versus supplier function by considering thegeneral nodes providing a broad range of system services. Whentapping.the resources of other nodes, a node is a consumer. Onthis basis noded at Level 4 are expected to devote resources tosupplier versus consumer in the ratio of 31100. Level 3 nodesproviding system services to a group of between 5 and 30 Level4 nodes dhould be furnidhing indirect services to a user populationof about 1000.They may also furnish library support services anddirect services. The proportion of effort at Level 3 to supplierversus consumer activities will range from 1/10 to 1/100.Level 2 nodes are expected to provide backup services toabout 10,000 users, as well as library support services and directservices.Supplier to consumer effort will generally range from1 to 1/10, but may in some regions approach 10, in the case of the\"libraries' library\".Since NLM will be dealing with requests that lower levelshave not been able to fill, its role is likely to be quantitativelydifferent.On the basis that the aim of the BeN is to equalize the bio-medical community's access to library services while upgrading theservices available, the report postulates five requirements foragreements:(a) that its own institution should maintain or increasethe support received by each node as total support for the networkincreases;(b) that users' demands are met at the lowest appropriate55 52 level in the network; (c) that network compatibility is assuret(d) that data necessary for monitoring the network's function arecollected; and (e) that each node in the network is responsive tothe needs of the levels it serves.Since specific agreements can only be worked out in the con-text of a particular region and of a particular stage of networkdevelopment,only general principles of agreements are detailedbetween nodes at one level and those at tlie next lower level.Responsibilities as a consumer will include maintaining resourcesat specific standards, observing rules in referring unmet requeststo higher levels, and supplying data on resources, direct services,and consumption of system services to higher levels. As a supplierof system services, a node will have to meet minimal standards inproviding services to lower-level nodes, to observe rules in pass-ing on unmet requests to higher levels, to supply data to higherlevels on system services, to develop a mechanism to insure respon-siveness to lower-level needs, to provide direct user services tothose without other facilities, and to provide specified systemservices to specific nodes. These last two responsibilities areappropriate for all Level 2 nodes and may be also for some Level3 nodes.The requirement to supply data to higher levels on systemservices is the only supplier requirement app-ropriate for Level 4nodes.At present, to determine responsibilities, minima require-ments for expenditures, materials, service tools, and staff will se> 53 have to be used. In the future, more relevant measures can bedetermined.Difficulties can be foreseen in specifying maintenance ofappropriate institutional support Where a Level 2 node is alreadya wholesale library; in specifying responsibilities of nodes whichare part of other library systems; in specifying eligibility forfree indirect user services; and in deciding how much standard-ization within and between regions is desirable and necessary.The'report suggests five other tadks to take priority: 1.To involve medical library leaders. First, a 2-daymeeting of NLM staff and the 6 librarians alreadyinvolved in the feedback process, to produce a paperfor discussion by Regional Program policymakers andthereafter the MLA membership, so that feedbadk maybe obtained. 2.To closely work with regions selected for the demon-stration Phase to work out agreements, priorities,schedules, and specifics, and decide how specialfacilities (such as industrial libraries) can betapped, and investigate such possibilities as auto-mated citation verification with MEDLARS and CurrentCatalog tapes.These will provide a sound basis forimplementing the plan.3.To develop criteria and cost-benefit measures forevaluation, collection of base-time data for eval-uation, and design of a program for obtaining follow-up data.4.To establish a conceptional framework and data forcomputer simulation of network traffic.5.To conduct logical analysis of how the librarycomponent might articulate with tile other componentsand dhare common links,'files, programs, and hardware.All these require only small expenditures now, and could in-sure that a rational network evolves. Later this may be very costly "}
