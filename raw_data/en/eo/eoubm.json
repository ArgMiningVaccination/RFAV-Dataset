Using eye-tracking to investigate the effect of complexity on attribute non-attendance in discrete choice experiments Jean Spinks1,2*and Duncan Mortimer1 Abstract Background: The provision of additional information is often assumed to improve consumption decisions, allowing consumers to more accurately weigh the costs and benefits of alternatives. However, increasing the complexity of decision problems may prompt changes in information processing. This is particularly relevant for experimental methods such as discrete choice experiments (DCEs) where the researcher can manipulate the complexity of thedecision problem. The primary aims of this study are (i) to test whether consumers actually process additional information in an already complex decision problem, and (ii) consider the implications of any such 'complexity-driven ' changes in information processing for design and analysis of DCEs. Methods: A discrete choice experiment (DCE) is used to simulate a complex decision problem; here, the choice between complementary and conventional medicine for different health conditions. Eye-tracking technology is used to capture the number of times and the duration that a participant looks at any part of a computer screen during completion of DCE choice sets. From this we can analyse what has become known in the DCE literature as 'attribute non-attendance '(ANA). Using data from 32 participants, we model the likelihood of ANA as a function of choice set complexity and respondent characteristics using fixed and random effects models to account for repeated choice setcompletion. We also model whether participants are consistent with regard to which characteristics (attributes) they consider across choice sets. Results: We find that complexity is the strongest predictor of ANA when other possible influences, such as time pressure, ordering effects, survey specific effects and socio-demographic variables (including proxies for prior experience with the decision problem) are considered. We also find that most participants do not apply a consistentinformation processing strategy across choice sets.

With regards to DCE design, results from the present study suggest that eye-tracking data can identify the point at which adding complexity (and realism) to DCE choice scenarios becomes self-defeati ng due to unacceptable increases in ANA. Eye-tracking data therefore has clear application in the construction of guidelines for DCE design and during piloting of DCE choice scenarios. With regards to design of policy measures such as labelling requirements for CAM and conventional medicines, the provision of additional information has the potenti al to make difficult decisions even harder and may not have the desired effect on decision-making. Keywords: Attribute non-attendance, Complexity, Information p rocessing, Eye tracking, Complementary medicine, Labelling Background The use of discrete choice experiments (DCEs) in health care has increased dramatically over the past decade [1 -4]. Arising from the disciplines of psychology and economics, the theoretical basis for DCEs can be found in random util- ity theory (RUT), developed by McFadden [5] and laterHanemann [6]. There is increasing evidence suggesting that decision making of the type emulated by DCEs is prone to diversions from the underlying theory [7, 8],which assumes that consumers are both fully informed and make 'rational '(optimising) decisions. Mainstream economic models typically assume that con- sumption choices can be improved simply by providingpeople with more and better information. There are, how- ever, many situations where this assumption may not holddue to limits on information-processing capacity. For very complex problems, consumers may be boundedly (rather than fully) rational [9, 10] and there is evidence to suggestthat consumers attempting to evaluate all available infor- mation and all available options are increasingly likely to make mistakes through this process [11]. Many consumerswill instead employ a 'satisficing '[12] or 'fast and frugal ' [13] heuristic whereby the mental task of calculating thecost and consequences of all po ssible options is overwhelm- ing; taking mental short-cuts to make decisions easier [14]. Recent findings from behavioural economics confirm that increases in the complexity of decision tasks may paralysedecision-making [15], although others argue that it is the nature of the information that is important, rather than the absolute amount [16]. One area of recent researchactivity focuses on so-called 'attribute non-attendance ' (ANA) [17, 18] which in simple terms means that individ-uals may either ignore or attach threshold values to cer-tain product characteristics before considering them. In the presence of ANA, DCE data may not characterise the preferences of affected individuals and standard ap-proaches to analysis may produce biased estimates of the relative importance of product attributes [19]. Empirically, two main methods have been employed to assess the existence and extent of ANA - (i) usingqualitative methods such as think-aloud protocols along-side stated-preference surveys [20], in-depth interviews and other supplementary questioning [21] to directlyquestion the respondent about their cognitive processing strategy in answering stated-preference surveys; and (ii) using quantitative models that allow the researcher somelatitude for inference, such as latent-class models, to -25]. From this growing lit- erature, it does appear that ANA may in fact be important when assessing the validity of stated-preference studies [17, 26] and that modelled coefficients should be adjusted accordingly. However, there are limitations when usingboth methods to reliably assess the presence and extent of any ANA. Eye-tracking technology provides a novel alternative capable of directly measuring ANA without interferingwith the decision making process or being constrained by computational limitations. First described in the1970s [27], eye-tracking technology allows the researcher to record where and for how long a respondent to a computer-based survey focuses their eyes. This meansthat researchers can assess if, and for how long, each at- tribute or choice is focused relative to all else, including the sequence of focusing. If this information can bemeaningfully interpreted, it may be used to determine whether attribute non-attendance is directly evident, whether systematic departures from the underlying the-ory can be identified, and ultimately, to inform how the predictive power of choice models can be improved to account for violations of the underlying assumptions. A small number of research groups have begun explor- ing use of eye-tracking technology to understand decision-making. For example, Rasch et al. [28] use a combinationof eye-tracking and facial electromyography to study affect in DCE decision making as it relates to marketing deci- sions; Arieli et al. [29] looks at decision-making underconditions of uncertainty (not in a DCE context); and, most relevant to the discussion here, Balcombe et al. [30] studied ANA within a DCE context as it relates to foodnutrition labels. All of these studies found evidence ofSpinks and Mortimer BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making (2016) 16:14 Page 2 of 13deviation from the underlying assumptions, acknow- ledging that work in this area is just beginning and there is still much to learn about the extent and effect thatsuch deviations might have on the predictive ability of choice modelling. Here, we make use of eye-tracking in simulated con- sumption decisions using a DCE framework to under-stand the process of consumer decision making in a complex, yet familiar, health environment -the pur- chase of medicine to treat a minor ailment. To begin with, we assess the presence of ANA under varying con- ditions of complexity and framing (different ailments).We then look at whether particular product attributes are more prone to ANA than others. Next, we focus on the potential determinants of any ANA found. As sug-gested by Lagarde [25], information processing is \"... likely to be influenced by the decision problem itself(e.g. its complexity), respondent specific characteristics(e.g. familiarity to the choice task, cognitive skills) and the broader context in which the choice task is taken (e.g. time pressure) \". Using this framework, we aim to model ANA as a function of these influences in an attempt to identify their relative importance. Finally, we test the assumption made in previous work in this area[23] that respondents are consistent with their informa- tion processing rules, that is, \"the decision on which attributes to consider does not change over the choices made by the same respondent \"(page 205). Methods Study context Our data was collected alongside the pilot study of aDCE which tests the effect of providing consumers withadditional information in the form of (i) regulatory state- ments; and /or (ii) summary information in the form of a'traffic light 'logo, on the label of both 'complementary ' (natural) or 'conventional '(pharmaceutical) medicines. Two different decision 'frames 'were tested in the form of two common ailments: sleep problems and joint pain[see Additional file 1: Figures A1 and A2]. The design of the main DCE aimed to address a real and current policy issue -whether consumers make better (or different) medicine purchasing decisions if compulsory labelling changes are implemented in an attempt to simplify the purchasing decision [31]. Different wordings of the proposed regulatory statement have appeared in the literature or the media [32 -34] [see Additional file 1: Figure A1 for descriptions]. Thus, weaim to test the potential effect on information processing of adding such statements to the already large amount of information that must be processed by consumers. As analternative to regulatory statements, we also investigate the addition of a traffic-light advisory system, similar to what is being used on many foods [35, 36], as away of highlighting key information for consumers [see Additional file 1: Figure A2]. Participants As geographical proximity was required (the eye- trackers were located at Monash University, Melbourne),a local recruitment strategy was necessary. Members of the University Staff (both academic and administrative) were invited to participate through a regular universitye-newsletter. We focused on staff rather than under- graduate students (although PhD students were allowed to participate) so as to gain a more representative groupin terms of demographics such as age and health status. Ethics approval was granted by Monash University [CF11/2535 -2011001482] and all participants provided written informed consent. Choice scenarios A DCE is one way of simulating the consumption choice and estimating how consumers may behave when characteristics (attributes) of the different choices(alternatives) are altered. B y accounting statistically for the different levels of attributes presented, researcherscan estimate the relative contributions of the differentattributes towards the chosen alternative. The intention of the present study is not, however, to estimate part- worth utilities and we were not constrained by consid-erations of efficiency or orthogonality that would motivate use of a formal experimental design when constructing choice scenarios. In the present study, wemanually constructed choice scenarios (described below) to simulate the effect of complexity on decision- making and to allow observation and recollection ofdecision-processes using eye-tracking and semi- structured interviews. 1Methods and results from the larger DCE using an experimental design (permitting efficient estimation of part-worth utilities) are reported elsewhere [31]. The online survey included eight choice scenarios per respondent, split equally across the two health condi-tions. To test the influence of complexity of the choice scenario (and cognitive burden), we allowed the num-ber of attributes presented in choice scenarios to vary f r o mt h r e et oe i g h t( s e eT a b l e2 ) .H a l ft h ep a r t i c i p a n t s were presented with an increasing number of attributes(increasing complexity); the other half was shown a decreasing number of attributes (decreasing complex- ity). In an attempt to minimise unthinking / mechanicalchoice, levels of attributes were varied across choice scenarios to obtain as much attribute balance as pos- sible within the constraints of the study design. Participants in the present study were asked to con- sider one of two scenarios -both of which describe mild health conditions (insomnia or joint pain) for which aSpinks and Mortimer BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making (2016) 16:14 Page 3 of 13range of self-care options are available. These two condi- tions were chosen due to their prevalence in the general population as well as the availability of both comple-mentary and conventional medicines for self-selection and treatment. Within each condition, participants were asked to choose between three alternatives - a conven-tional medicine, a complementary medicine and 'neither of these '(opt out option). This study forms part of a larger, multi-disciplinary project focused on complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) use in people with chronic illness. The identification of attributes and levels for inclusionin the DCE choice scenarios therefore drew on qualita- tive work completed as part of the broader project, as well as a survey in the target population ( N= 2,915) describing motivations for and use of CAM alongside conventional medicine [37 -39]. A summary of all iden- tified attributes and levels tested in the pilot is available in the Additional file 1: Table A1. Some of the attributes, such as 'who recommended the product 'and 'where it is available ', were arranged (formatted) in a number of boxes underneath the initial health scenario description and above the product label. The remaining attributes, apart from price, were dis-played as part of a product label, designed to be as real- istic as possible and to group related attributes. Price was displayed under the labels, to represent how itemsare usually displayed on shop shelves. An example sce- nario is available in the Additional file 1: Table A2. Choice scenarios were uploaded as an online survey. Par-ticipants were asked to complete the online survey on spe- cialized computers with eye-tracking capabilities as their first task. No specific training materials were provided toparticipants apart from a general introduction and a prac- tice DCE choice set (using a transport scenario) and no prior mention of the traffic light or regulatory statementswas made before the survey commenced. Measurement of attribute non-attendance (ANA) Eye-tracking technology has evolved rapidly in recent years. Earlier prototypes required participants to wear bulky headwear and/or electrodes and stay in rela-tively uncomfortable positions for periods of time. Newer eye-trackers can be installed into regular- looking desktop computers and do not require theuse of additional external hardware. For the present study, there was no requ irement for headwear or electrodes and, apart from completion of a short cali- bration of each individual 's eyes to the screen (about 30 s) and being asked to remain as still as possibleduring the survey to maximise the likelihood of beingdetected by the eye-tracker, participants should have remained relatively unaware that they are working on anything other than a regular computer. Informedconsent was obtained from all participants to use the eye-tracking technology. Here we used a Tobii T120 eye-tracker and associated software (Studio Version2.3.2.0) to formulate the raw data which was then exported and analysed in Sta ta 13 statistical software [40]. The eye-tracking data so obtained consists of fixations (unique observations for each time a partici- pant focuses or fixates on anything within the cali- brated screen) and saccades and allowed identificationof area of fixations, duration of fixations and order of fixations. Data for pupil dilation was also available but not made use of in this analysis. Using the specialised Tobii software, we can build a matrix of \"areas of interest \"(AOI) overlaying the image for each choice set. Each AOI represents onecell and here the cells of interest are alternative- specific attributes. An example of an AOI coded choice set is provided in the Additional file 1: FigureA5. The software can then calculate a number of metrics for each AOI including the number of times each attribute was visited, how long each 'fixation ' 2 (look) lasted and the size of the pupil. Given the large amount of data available, we limit our analysis here to the number of times an attribute was visited. Fromthis we can calculate the inverse -whether the attri- bute was fixated at all during the choice set. As thelevel of an attribute can only influence attendance toan attribute if that attribute is first fixated, here we leave aside attribute levels as predictors of ANA. Statistical analysis (i)Description of the existence, extent and variation of attribute non-attendance (ANA) across questionsand attributes: We summarise the eye-tracking data to show the extent of attendance to eachattribute across different questions and forquestions with different levels of complexity (number of attributes). We present results for whether ANA occurs across both alternatives(CAM and conventional), before considering whether ANA occurs for each alternative taken individually. The ANA data is then disaggregated to describe ANA by attribute. (ii)Determination of the most likely contributors to ANA: Following Lagarde [ 25], we hypothesise that complexity has an independent and direct effecton ANA (increased complexity is associated withincreased ANA). To test this hypothesis, we regress ANA on complexity while controlling for other characteristics of the decision problem(condition and direction 3), context (time pressure4), and respondent characteristics. We estimate the effect of complexity on attributenon-attendance using both fixed and randomSpinks and Mortimer BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making (2016) 16:14 Page 4 of 13effects panel regressions. Equation ( 1)s p e c i f i model: ANA participant iin choice- setj;icaptures individual-specific fixed/random effects controlling for observed and unobserved respondent characteristics; complexity jis the number of attributes present in choice-set t; condition jis a dummy indicator coded as 1 if choice-set jrelates to the joint pain scenario (and 0 for the insomnia scenario) ;time_pressure is a dummy indicator of whether the appointment time was late (after 5.30 pm)5; direction iis a dummy indicator of whether the participant received choice-sets ordered in increasing (forward) or decreasing (reverse) complexity; Wiis the matrix of respondent characteristics; and ijis an idiosyncratic error. The intention here is not to estimate part-worth utilities and the parameter of primary interest is .W h e r e is positive and significant, attribute non- attendance increases with complexity (as hypothesised). We also include complexity as a quadratic term to allow a non-linear relationship between ANA and complexity. Included in the matrix of respondent characteristics are dummy variables for gender; a continuous measure for age (and age squared to allow for non-linear effects); a dummy variable coded 1 for education levels belowuniversity level 6; and a dummy variable coded 1 for post-graduate students.7Also included is a dummy variable indicating if the participant reported usingdifferent CM products in the previous 12 months to account for prior experience and to proxy for ap r i o r i preferences. Three variables are included: i. vitamin (self-selected) = taken a vitamin, mineral or herbal supplement not prescribed by a medicaldoctor in the past 12 months; ii. vitamin (prescribed) = taken a vitamin, mineral or herbal supplement prescribed by a medical doctorin the past 12 months; iii. other CAM = used other complementary and alternative medicine products or therapies (hereit includes Western herbal medicines; Chinesemedicines; acupuncture or indigenous or traditional folk therapies) We hypothesised that participants 'a priori preferences may make them more inclined towardschoosing particular alternatives, and as the alternatives here are labelled (that is, they arespecified to be 'conventional 'and 'complementary ' medicines rather than a generic option of 'Medicine A'versus 'Medicine B '), then we may also expectANA to vary between alternatives, as well as between attributes. To account for this potential labelling effect, we also run the regression specifiedin Equation ( 1), but with ANA now 'alternative specific '-that is, the dependent variable is now the number of attributes not attended to within analternative, rather than across all alternatives. This is expressed in equations ( 2) and Definitions of explanatory variables remain consistent with equation ( 1). (iii)Consistency with which decision rules are applied:Finally, we also test a previous assumption made byothers investigating ANA [ 41] whereby participants are consistent with regard to which attributes theyconsider across choice sets (and by implication,which to ignore). To do this, we construct a measure of 'consistency 'of individual i, detailed in Equation ( 4): consistency i\u00bcmean s ijSi/C0/C12\u00f04\u00de where sis the proportion of attributes attended to in choice set jby individual iand Siis the mean of sfor in- dividual i. Here, a higher value indicates less consistency across choice sets and more deviation in terms of the number of available attributes attended/not attended to.We then regress consistency as the dependent variable with the same set of explanatory variables detailed in equations 1,2and 3, with the exclusion of complexity and condition (which are invariant when considering consistency across choice-sets), as detailed in Equation (5) below: consistencyi\u00bci\u00fetime pressurei\u00fedirection i\u00feWi\u00feij \u00f05\u00de Results Thirty-nine participants completed the survey using theeye-tracking technology. However, the quality of eye- tracking data was insufficient in the case of seven partic- ipants, and their data is excluded in this analysis. 8Table 1 details the participant characteristics. The majority of participants are female (75 %), highly educated and in higher income groups. The majority (75 %) also reportSpinks and Mortimer BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making (2016) 16:14 Page 5 of 13having taken a self-selected vitamin, mineral or herbal product in the previous 12 months. We summarise attribute attendance by question in Table 2, first across the two alternatives combined andthen for each alternative separately. For example, in the first line of Table 2 (for question 1) it can be seen that32 participants (100 %) attended to all attributes in at least one of the alternatives but not all participants attended to every attribute in every alternative. 28 partic-ipants (88 %) attended to all attributes in the conven- tional medicine alternative and 29 participants (91 %) attended to all attributes in the conventional medicinealternative. It can be seen that attendance is relatively high for the first four questions, but drops from 100 % (all attributes attended to when considering combinedalternatives) in question 1 down to 50 % in question 8. A similar pattern can be seen when considering eachalternative separately; with the proportion declining aswe move from question 1 to 8. Across all participants, the mean number of attributes not attended to across all choice sets is 0.45 (sd 0.93,skewness 2.50, kutosis 9.61). For the conventional alter- native the mean is 0.74 (sd 1.18, skewness 1.87, kurtosis6.39) and for the CM alternative 0.75 (sd 1.12, skewness 1.82, kurtosis 6.04). The paired t-test for the mean differ- ence of the two alternatives is significant ( p= 0.05). The effect of viewing the questions in forward (in- creasing complexity) compared to reverse order is shown in Figure 1. Mean ANA is zero for questions 1and 3 and is lower in all questions framed by the 'joint ' scenario as compared with the corresponding 'insomnia ' question (that is, mean ANA is less in Q1 cf Q2, Q3 cfQ4, Q5 cf Q6 and Q7 cf Q8 in the forward order and the contrary is true for the reverse order). There is slightly less ANA at question 8 by those participantswho completed the survey in reverse order, however for questions 3 to 6 there is higher mean ANA for reverse order participants. In general, there is higher ANA forthe questions with more attributes, irrespective of the order in which the survey was seen. Mean ANA by alter- native is shown in Figure 2. Both figures show a rela-tively large ANA increase/drop between questions 4 and 5 (or, for reverse order, between questions 5 and 4) which is where the product labels appear/disappear forthe first time, greatly increasing/decreasing the amount of information to be considered. The trends in ANA across questions for both alternatives are similar. Themean time taken to answer each choice set is shown in Figure 3 and shows that, on average, more time was spent on answering question 1 if the survey was shown inforward order, and more time on question 8 if the survey was seen in reverse order. The total curve (forward and reverse order curves combined) is broadly u-shaped, withthe time taken dropping steeply if the survey is seen in forward order (from question 1 to 2) or in reverse order (from question 8 to 7). We then look to see if there are particular attributes which are more prone to ANA than others and this ispresented in Table 3. Notably, price was missed by just over 16 % of participants on average for the 5 questions in which it was available, a phenomenon that has beenfound by others [25] and a concern for willingness-to- pay estimates from DCEs. Other attributes that appeared more likely to be missed included where the productwas available (by up to 19 % of participants) and the caution and warnings on the labels (by up to 22 and 31 % of participants, respectively). The traffic light wasmissed by 15 and 22 % of participants in question 7 and 8 respectively. Results from the main regressions are presented in Table 4.

The fixed and random effects models (models 1 and 2, respectively) providedsimilar estimates and tests for the appropriateness of using the random effects model did not reject the null that results are consistent (see the footnote to Table 4for details). We also re-run the model after centring the mean of complexity at zero and although the beta coeffi- cients on complexity differ, the sign and significance areunchanged.ANA was less likely for the joint scenario and more likely for participants who had a late appointment (bothsignificant at the 10 % level in model 2), although theeffect of the late appointment was not robust to different cut-off times. The order in which the survey was com- pleted was not found to be associated with ANA. Somevariation was shown in the relationship between socio- demographic variables and alternative-specific ANA: lower levels of education were associated with higherANA in the conventional medicine alternative and those who had taken a vitamin prescribed by a medical doctor in the previous 12 months were more likely to missattributes in the CM alternative.Table 2 Number of participants who attended to every attribute for both conventional & CM alternatives combined, and each alternative alone ( N= 32) Question Number attributes Health condition Alts combineda # participants (%)Conv alternative # participants (%)CM alternative# participants (%) 1 3 joint 32 (100) 28 (88) 29 (91) 2 3 insomnia 28 (88) 24 (75) 20 (63) 3 4 joint 32 (100) 26 (81) 24 (75) 4 4 insomnia 25 (78) 24 (75) 18 (56) 5 5 joint 20 (63) 13 (41) 14 (44) 6 6 insomnia 18 (56) 13 (41) 12 (38) 7 8 joint 17 (53) 13 (41) 12 (38) 8 8 insomnia 16 (50) 15 (47) 13 (41) Abbreviations: Altsalternatives, conv conventional, CMcomplementary medicine, #number aFor a participant to have attended to an attribute, they had to have one or more fixations on that attribute, irrespective of whether they looked at the levels of the attribute in both choices Note: The 'neither of these 'option did not have any attributes specified and is excluded from this analysis Figure 1Mean attribute non-atten dance byquestion order Spinks and Mortimer BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making (2016) 16:14 Page 7of13The mean for the measure of consistency across the sample was 0.016 (sd 0.020, skewness 1.76, kutosis 5.84), with 10 participants having a mean of zero (that is, theywere entirely consistent in terms of how many attributes were missed across all choice sets). In terms of the consistency regression (model 5), younger age was associ-ated with greater consistency, although as shown by the positive and significant coefficient on the corresponding quadratic term, this effect decreases as age increases.Discussion and conclusions This paper adds to the growing literature regarding attri-bute non-attendance in DCEs and to our knowledge is thefirst to explicitly focus on the relationship between com- plexity and ANA for decicions regarding health service utilisation Our results show there is a strong positive andstatistically significant relationship between ANA and complexity and that this relationship is robust to a num- ber of different model specifications. Importantly, we find Figure 3 Mean time spent on each question (minutes) Figure 2 Mean conventional & Cm attribute non-attendance Spinks and Mortimer BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making (2016) 16:14 Page 8 of 13that complexity is the strongest predictor of ANA when other possible influences, such as time pressure, ordering effects, survey specific effects and socio-demographic vari- ables (including proxies for prior experience of the deci-sion problem) are considered. We also find that ANA, as well as the consistency with which attribute attendance is applied across choice sets, does show some evidence ofheterogeneity across different socioeconomic variables, specifically for education and age. Like others, we do find considerable departure from the assumptions underpin-ning RUT which assumes consumers maximise their util- ity based on all available information [25, 30]. Similar to Balcombe [30], we found that full attendance to all attri-butes across all choice sets is unusual, however, ANA wassignificantly less present for choice sets with fewerattributes. 9 The interpretation of this finding should be taken within the context of this particular study. In generalparticipants reported being engaged with the survey and although many stated that the choice sets with more in- formation took longer to process, the information itselfwas not difficult to understand. Most also reported that they thought all attributes were potentially relevant to their decision and there were no recommendations toremove particular attributes (only to change one of the levels of one of the attributes). What has yet to be clearly determined in the literature is whether, and the extent to which, utility functionsTable 3 Eye-tracking results -percent participants who did not attend to each attribute, disaggregated by within alternative non-attendancea Question number 1 2345678 Attribute Recommendation 0 3 % 0 0 3 % 6 % 0 0c Recommendation - conv 3 % 6 % 3 % 0 9 % 9 % 6 % 10 % Recommendation - CM 6 % 16 % 13 % 16 % 19 % 19 % 19 % 19 %Side effects 0 3 % 0 0 13 % 3 % 6 % 6 % Side effects - conv 9 % 13 % 6 % 6 % 16 % 13 % 13 % 16 % Side effects - CM 3 % 9 % 6 % 16 % 28 % 16 % 19 % 16 % Where available 0 6 % 0 9 % 19 % 9 % 3 % 16 % Where available - conv 9 % 22 % 9 % 16 % 28 % 19 % 16 % 26 % Where available - CM 3 % 16 % 6 % 9 % 31 % 19 % 13 % 23 % Price NA NA 0 13 % 16 % 22 % 13 % 19 % Price - conv NA NA 9 % 16 % 34 % 44 % 41 % 39 % Price - CM NA NA 9 % 13 % 34 % 34 % 28 % 26 % Dosage bNA NA NA NA 0 0 6 % 6 % Dosageb- conv NA NA NA NA 9 % 13 % 6 % 6 % Dosageb-C M NA NA NA NA 3 % 3 % 9 % 10 % Caution NA NA NA NA 13 % 22 % 3 % 10 % Caution - conv NA NA NA NA 31 % NA 16 % NA Caution - CM NA NA NA NA 13 % 22 % 9 % 10 % Warning NA NA NA NA NA 31 % 19 % 10 % Warning - conv NA NA NA NA NA 31 % 19 % 10 % Warning - CM NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA Traffic light NA NA NA NA NA NA 16 % 23 % Traffic light - conv NA NA NA NA NA NA NA 23 % Traffic light - CM NA NA NA NA NA NA 16 % NA Regulation -CM (only) NA NA NA NA NA NA 16 % 16 % NAnot applicable -the attribute did not appear in the particular question Conv conventional medicine, CMcomplementary medicine aThe corresponding questions, whether seen in forward or reverse order, are combined here and presented as if the forward order has been seen by the participant (ie. question 1 data in the forward order and question 8 data in the reverse order has been aggregated) bDosage was considered to be a fixed attribute (the levels did not change) -it was included for realism cDenominator is 31 participants in question 8 due to missing eye-tracking data for participant 124Spinks and Mortimer BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making (2016) 16:14 Page 9 of 13should be adjusted for ANA. The present study was con- ducted alongside the pilot for a DCE and varied the number of attributes across choice sets to identify theeffect of complexity on ANA. As a consequence, we observed limited variation across attribute levels for some attributes and could not account for the effect ofall attributes when estimating utility functions. Lagarde [25] found that whilst willingness-to-pay estimates were sensitive to ANA, the behavioural prediction of DCE models was not affected by ANA. One explanation for this may be that consumers are so accustomed to usingheuristics or decision rules in complex or uncertain situ- ations that they are well practised in seeking out infor- mation that will be useful to them in their final decision(in essence, conferring zero utility for any attributes superfluous to their needs). Thus, reading attribute and alternative labels may be sufficient for some consumersto decide if the subsequent information available is worthwhile attending to or not. We did, however, find evidence that ANA differed across alternatives, although the mean effect was shownto be small. While we cannot rule out here that this effectmay also represent left-right logographical ordering, differ- ences in socio-demographic determinants of alternative-specific ANA such as prior use of a prescribed vitamin are perhaps more consistent with a CM-CAM effect than a left-right effect. In any event, the effect of alternative-specific ANA on utility functions, as compared to 'total ' ANA for a given attribute is worthy of further consider-ation (regardless of whether it represents a CM-CAM or left-right effect). Alternative-specific ANA may also offer additional insights into the decision processing strategyused by participants during DCEs. Other results were also interesting. As seen in Figure 1, ANA was consistently lower for the questions framed bythe 'joint 'scenario (questions 1, 3, 5 & 7 in the forward order) compared with the corresponding 'insomnia ' questions. This may indicate a framing effect, wherebyparticipants were more likely to not attend to attributes in the insomnia questions, perhaps due to strongly formed opinions as to how each ailment 'should 'be treated (prior experience) or strong preferences forTable 4 Summary of main results from eye-tracking regression of attribute non-attendance (ANA) (1) Number ANA, fe (2) Number ANA, re (3) Number ANA (conv), re (4) Number ANA (CM), re (5) Consistencya b s ep b s ep b s e p b s e p b .356 .245 .612 Abbreviations: ANA attribute non-attendance OR attributes not attended (to), complexity2 complexity squared, age2 age squared, uniuniversity, conv conventional medicine, CMcomplementary medicine, vit (self-selected) taken a vitamin, mineral or herbal supplement not prescribed by a medical doctor in the past 12 months; vit (prescribed) taken a vitamin, mineral or herbal supplement prescribed by a medical doctor in the past 12 months; other CAM used other complementary and al- ternative medicine products or therapies (here it includes Western herbal medicine; Chinese medicine; CAM practitioners, or indigenous or traditional folk therapies) aAs measured by the mean(s ij-S)2where s is the proportion of attributes attended to in choice set jby individual iand S i= mean (s) for individual i[whereby a higher value indicates less consistency and more deviation in terms of attribute non-attendance] b,c,dindicates significance at the 1, 5 and 10 % levels respectively eObservations are based on data from 32 participants, however, eye-tracking data is absent for question 8 for one participant (124) We test for the appropriateness of using a random effects model using a robust Hausman test using a Wald test and cluster-robust standard errors (Wooldrige, 2002) after excluding participant 124 for whom there is missing eye-tracking data for question 8 (the scalar theta cannot be calculated for an unbalanced panel). The null hypothesis assumes that individual effects are random and both fixed and random effect estimators are consistent. The test does not reject th en u l l( p=0 . 6 5 2 ) . We also perform an over-identification test with the null-hypothesis (participant 124 included) that the group means are uncorrelated with the idiosyncratic error term.The test does not reject the null ( p= 0.911). From this we conclude that the random effects estimator results are appropriateSpinks and Mortimer BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making (2016) 16:14 Page 10 of 13natural or conventional medicines in specific contexts. Aside from the framing effect, the general trend for more ANA in questions with more attributes supportsthe notion that increased complexity is linked with more ANA irrespective of the order in which questions were seen. The time taken to answer each question (Fig. 3)broadly displays a 'U'shape for the combined forward and reverse order surveys (total sample line), perhapssuggesting a learning effect which means the time takendecreases to a point before fatigue starts to increase. However, the forward curve consistently shows longer times taken for questions 1, 3, 5 & 7 (joint scenarioquestions) compared with the corresponding insomnia questions (which interestingly corresponds to lower ANA for the joint questions compared with the insom-nia questions in Fig. 1). This is not seen for the reverse order curve which shows consistently decreasing times taken for questions 8 to 2, increasing slightly again forthe final question 1. It is not apparent why a framing effect might be present only in the forward order survey and this is worthy of further consideration. The finding that 'consistency 'with regard to the num- ber of attributes attended to across choice sets decreasedwith age may be potentially explained by a decrease incognitive function over time, although this cannot be tested here. Results are not consistent with the assump- tion made by Hole [41] that the decision of which attri-bute/s to consider is stable across choice sets and are instead more supportive of the notion that this varies over choice sets, as suggested by others [26]. This study also has some important implications for the design of DCEs measuring health and health-carepreferences more generally. This study, which also actedas a pilot for a larger DCE, highlights the design com- plexity of some of the scenarios encountered by health researchers and raises further questions about how thequalitative properties of the survey, such as the descrip- tion of attributes and levels, presentation of choice sets and clarity of instructions may impact on ANA. Whencombined with findings regarding the effect of ANA on utility estimates, our findings regarding the effect of complexity on ANA should permit identification of the point at which adding complexity (and realism) to DCE choice scenarios becomes self-defeating. One of the obvious limitations of this analysis is the small and unrepresentative sample size. Despite avoiding an entire undergraduate student population, the re-cruited sample remained better educated and from higher socioeconomic circumstances than the general population. The majority (75 %) of participants reportedself-selection of a vitamin, mineral or herbal product in the previous 12 months which is higher than reports in the literature for Australian populations [42]. For thispresumably less 'boundedly 'rational sample, we mightexpect additional information to evoke fewer changes in information processing than for the general population [43]. Therefore, our results are likely to underestimateANA in the general population. Additionally, we only tested complexity over a range of 3 -8 attributes, which is the upper limit of attributes reported to be routinely included in DCEs in the health setting [2]. It must be remembered that some attributes are only seen in two questions (for example, the regulatory statements andtraffic light logos are only seen in questions 7 & 8). Thus, caution should be exercised in drawing conclu- sions regarding the effect of additional attributes inother DCE studies. Further, we did not set out to test the effect of the location (page orientation) of attributes as it relates to ANA, whereby there may be a systematicdifference due to orientation alone (eg. the bottom of the page may be more prone to ANA). The rapid advancements in eye-tracking technology over recent years have meant that this technology is likelyto be used more extensively to investigate questions of information processing across a range of disciplines,including in health economics. Alongside this, methodo- logical questions also need to be answered regarding the use of other available metrics (fixations, saccades, pupildilation), the definitions applied (for example, ANA) and how these may be linked to neurological process to pro- vide greater insight into decision-making processes.Recent progress on this front suggests that the full poten- tial of combining eye-tracking data with more familiar qualitative and quantitative data is yet to be realised. Endnotes 1This study was also used to pilot test the attributes and levels of the DCE for use in a subsequent study using a larger sample size. 2The eye-tracker collects raw data every 16.7 milliseconds and assigns to each data point a location. A fixation filter isthen applied to determine if each data point is a 'fixation 'or 'saccade' (for two points to be considered as part of the same fixation, the distance between two data points mustbe below a minimal threshold). We used the default 'Clear- View 'settings for the I-VT (Velocity Threshold Identifica- tion) fixation filter [Tobii S tudio 2.X, Release 2.2, User Manual (2010). http://www.tobii.com/]. 3Dummy variables indicating (i) whether the choice set relates to the joint pain scenario or to the insomnia sce-nario and (ii) whether the survey was seen in increasing order of complexity (forward) or decreasing order ofcomplexity (reverse) were included in the model. 4The time taken to complete each choice set was recorded during the experiment, however, this measureis likely to reflect complexity and respondent character- istics rather than context. A suitable proxy for time pres- sure was therefore identified. As the appointment timeSpinks and Mortimer BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making (2016) 16:14 Page 11 of 13for each participant varied, we reasoned that appoint- ments later in the day were more likely to be associated with greater time pressure as changes in traffic condi-tions and outside work activities are more likely to be given higher consideration around this time. 5This cut-off was chosen as it is a time when most people have finished work for the day. Only three indi-viduals were classified as having a late appointment using this definition. The robustness of the cut-off istested during the analysis and reported in the results section. 6Due to the sample being drawn from a university, this variable is also likely to indicate professional (non-aca-demic) staff status. 7Undergraduate students were excluded from participating. 8The eye-tracking software provides a percentage of the time over the duration of the survey for which eye- tracking data was collected. If participants did not remain still enough, for example, and data was not able to be captured for some of the time, the percentage wasless than 100 %. As a general rule, we excluded partici- pants for this analysis if their percentage tracked was 50 % or less, however, this is an overall figure whichincludes time spent on both the DCE choice sets and introduction/demographics sections, and it was relaxed in the case of six participants where it was deemed therewas sufficient data capture during the DCE section for them to be included. 9It is also important to note that Balcombe used a dif- ferent definition of ANA whereby meeting or exceedingthe threshold of two fixations per attribute defined attendance, whereas we used the stricter definition ofzero fixations to define non-attendance.
