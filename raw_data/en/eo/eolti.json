While there are groups that combine mathematics and the physical sciences, the IMBS is the only research institute devoted toward using the strengths of mathematical reasoning to analyze and resolve issues from the behavioral and social sciences. As this report indicates, strong progress is being made on a surprising variety of fronts. Indeed, our charge of meeting new challenges by using mathematical methods---and creating new mathematical approaches when needed---means that the focus of the IMBS changes on a regular basis. Thus, the annual report allows a review of what new has happened and where we now are moving. But before indicating some of what we do, it must be mentioned that beyond our members (who come from at least five UCI schools), the IMBS provides an interdisciplinary home for interested UCI faculty and graduate students with our colloquia, conferences, study groups, and other activities. (Most of the speakers at our graduate student conference (Section IV, D), for instance, are not affiliated with our graduate program.) These pursuits have made the IMBS a UCI \"center of convergence.\" Let me strongly recommend that you sample some of the recent IMBS contributions by skimming through Section II D of this report, which provides summaries of research contributions. As examples of contributions to pragmatics, a thorny topic to be considered this fall by the US Supreme Court is that of gerrymandering---earlier this academic year, our IMBS colleague B. Grofman, one of the top exerts in this area, carried out the court mandated reapportionment of Virginia's congressional map and has extensively lectured on this topic. Then, M. Kaminski has been working closely with several Polish politicians on electoral reform, while R. Taagepera's developed a new way to detect, and explain, the number of parties in a country. Related is the actual practice of voting, where J. Duffy developed a mathematical analysis of the cost of acquiring information before doing so. One annoyance of living where we do is driving on the 405, which leads to D. Brownstone and M. McBride's research of creating an experimental game theoretic platform to experimentally analyze traffic decisions with a goal of finding practical solutions. Related is J. Brueckner's mathematical analysis of airline emission charges. A. Noymer continues his work on demography with an emphasis on contemporary health concerns, and R. Keller's study of risk and decision analysis is identifying a variety of central issues that need clarification.4Considerable amount of IMBS emphasis focuses on human decision making, such as M. Komarova's mathematical study of the ability of humans to modify and create a \"language\" (where her math modeling, in part, explains data about a deaf child acquiring sign language) and L. Pearl's examination of linguistics to explore the creative but immature minds of children. In a series of experiments, M. Birnbaum proved that many people consistently choose the worse alternative. Why? To answer this question, he is developing a new mathematical explanation. (This work is related to Duncan Luce's seminal contributions.) Among his many activities, L. Narens has shown that although standard probability notions are excellent for the physical sciences, they are not adequate to handle issues from the social sciences, which leads to his foundational work on creating new, appropriate probability measures. M. Lee continues his analysis of how decisions are made with the mathematical use of Bayesian methods applied to individual data. Much of human behavior is governed by social norms, where C. O'Connor, among others in the IMBS, is developing a mathematical approach to understand the emergences of these norms. In addition to his influential work on social norms, B. Skyrms also is exploring new ways to handle utility. The complexity of the social and behavioral sciences is analyzed by several, including C. Butts' analysis of complex systems, K. Romney's development of mathematical models of human color vision, and K. Jameson's continuing work on cultural differences in human color categorization. In this general category is J-P Carvalho's fascinating mathematical models of religion that are providing explanations of seemingly paradoxical religious practices, Analysis on the theoretical side comes from S. Frank and his study of invariances, J. Yellott's mathematical analysis of eye focus, and J. Boyd and B. Batchelder's clever use of how a certain abstract algebraic tool can provide insight into data structures. What an incredible array of valued contributions! What pulls all of this together, what allows interactions with opportunities for each of us to learn ideas from others, are the several active IMBS study groups, as well as our regular colloquia and conferences (Sections III--V). This research is nicely funded with external grants. (See Section VI B.) But because there are absolutely no incentives to have grants go through the IMBS (e.g., the overhead that is \"credited\" to the IMBS is reported to us, but we never see it), we decided to encourage IMBS members to channel grant proposals through their departments. Should the incentives change, where the IMBS does receive overhead to support our research activities, the IMBS will react to aggressively encourage new grants. While a lot is being done, what is important for our success is our Department Administrator, Joanna Kerner. Her consistent attention not only to what must be done, but also to what should or could be accomplished, is invaluable. Speaking on behalf of the IMBS, our warm thanks to Joanna!5With my retirement, this is my last annual report. The 14 years I have served as Director have been rewarding. Through the research interactions, discussions, thoughts, and contributions of so many IMBS colleagues, I have learned much that has strongly altered my own research agenda. It has been a delight working with IMBS colleagues and graduate students who have willingly cooperated on a wide range of activities. My expectation is that this strong cooperation will continue with Jean-Paul Carvalho, who was appointed the interim Director. Sincerely, Donald G. Saari Director, IMBS6I.

RESEARCH A. Current Research Programs There are 63 members of the Institute for Mathematical Behavioral Sciences (IMBS) and their research interests are listed in Appendix A. The IMBS is roughly partitioned into five research clusters. These are listed below and should be considered as informal intellectual groupings, rather than formal structures. Measurement Theory, Foundational Issues, and Scaling Models: Barrett, Batchelder, Burton, Iverson, Romney, Sperling, Yellott, Narens, and Brueckner, Burton, Carvalho, Networks: Batchelder, Boyd, Frank, Huttegger, Johnson, Narens, Romney, Saari, Skyrms, Smyth, Stern, and White B. Publications The members who have replied report a total of 136 journal publications (published or in press) for the current academic year. These are listed in Appendix B. The IMBS has a technical report series that is available to all members and qualified graduate students who are submitting a paper to a refereed journal or book. The series editor is Donald Saari. Appendix C lists the technical reports issued during the academic year. Technical reports since 1993 can be found under \"printed resources\" on the Institute's web site at http://www.imbs.uci.edu/research/technical.php. C. Public Talks and Colloquia IMBS members actively participated in numerous off-campus research seminars and conferences. The members who replied gave a total of 145 talks listed in Appendix D. Their awards and achievements for this year can be found in Appendix E. D. Summaries of Research Findings An important aspect of the Institute is the research conclusions developed by its members. What follows is a sample of what has happened this year.8Measurement Theory, Foundational Issues, and Scaling Models Louis Narens During the 2016-2017 Academic year my research has fallen into five areas: (1)Foundations of a quantum-like probability for application in behavioral science (2)Use new theories of probability based on intuitionistic logic for decision making (3)Evolution of color categorization systems (4)Using current ideas, mathematics, and methods to provide foundations for early economic thinking about utility (1) is a continuation of a long term research project of mine. It is based on the premise that context is pervasive is psychology and the behavioral sciences and there is little modeling about it except for developing methodologies that attempt to control it. I see a great part of the difficulty in modeling the effects of context as coming from the use of standard probability theory for describing the decision-like mechanisms humans use in making choices. I developed and worked out the foundations of two new kinds of probability theories for this. Both are generalizations of standard probability theory. One is described in (2). The other generalizes the mathematical structure inherent in the probability theory developed by the mathematician John von Neumann for the foundations of quantum mechanics. During this academic year I published three articles that focused on this generalization: \"Probabilistic frames for non-Boolean phenomena'' in Philosophical Transacts A of the Royal Society; \"Topological and orthomodular modeling of context in behavioral science\" in Frontiers in Physics; and \"An introduction to lattice based probability theories\" in the Journal of Mathematical Psychology. (2) is another aspect of this long-term research project. It develops a probability theory that is based on a logic (called intuitionistic logic) that was designed for issues in the foundations of mathematics and applies it issues in behavioral science. Intuitionistic logic, formulated as event spaces for a generalization of Kolmogorov probability theory, is used to model rational decisions under contextual changes including emotions. Two articles about it was published during the academic year: \"Multimode utility theory\" in the Journal of Mathematical Psychology,\" and \"Modeling decisions involving ambiguous, vague, or rare events,\" with IMBS member Donald Saari (Economics, Mathematics) in G. Chichilnisky and A. Rezai (eds.), The Economics of Global Environment, Studies in Economic Theory 29. (3) concerns work on a grant on which I am Co-PI (IMBS member Kimberly Jameson PI). It is about the individual and social evolutions of concepts. During the last academic year, I have been involve in color categorization research of color categorization systems from societies that non-industrialized and isolated. 2 articles has been recently written by our team about this, one published and one submitted. The published one is, Fider (graduate student, mathematics), Narens (IMBS, 9(4) Komarova (IMBS, mathematics), \"A quantitative approach for defining basic color terms and color category best exemplars,\" Journal of the Optical Society of America. This article replaces a linguistically based core concept of \"basic color term\" that requires a semantic understanding of the language with a statically derived one based on a mathematical model and categorization data. This research is part of the lead author's (Fider) PhD research. The second article, Park (undergraduate, computer Tauber (IMBS), Jameson (IMBS), Narens (IMBS, cognitive sciences), \"The evolution shared concepts in changing populations,\" submitted, shows how birth-death dynamics and others that change the composition of populations can produce systematic, desirable changes that are absent in other commonly used evolutionary processes. This research was part of first author Park's Honors Thesis that I supervised. (5) Recently Brian Skyrms (IMBS, LPS) and I started to collaborate of applying modern mathematical methods from measurement theory and psychophysics to issues raised by the early economist Bentham in the late Eighteenth Century concerning the economic concept of \"utility.\" The premise is that Bentham and the early economists did not have the appropriate mathematical and psychological theory to provide a suitable foundation for their ideas, and this lack was a principal reason for their later rejection. We have one article in submission about this, \"Accommodation dynamics for comparing utilities with others,\" that will be part of a larger work. Also during the last academic year, I served as Graduate Director of the Mathematical Behavioral Sciences Graduate Program. This year we were allocated two students to recruit, which we have done successfully. This coming year, we will investigate whether we want to enlarge our graduate program, as now there appears there might be available resources for doing this. Statistical Modeling Michael Lee My work continues to focus on modeling human decision making and individual differences, especially through the application of Bayesian methods and real-world data. Highlights for this year have included an invited handbook chapter on the topic of Bayesian methods in cognitive modeling, and a journal paper with Wolf Vanpaemel focused on the construction of Bayesian priors in the cognitive modeling context. Lisa Pearl A related set of findings concerns how the cognitively immature minds of children solve the various tasks involved in native language learning (called language acquisition). Pearl (under review) discusses how computational and mathematical modeling are invaluable tools for scientists who want to understand the language acquisition strategies that children use. This is because modeling provides a way to concretely realize a theory about a learning strategy, apply that strategy to realistic language data, and see the results of the learning strategy. This approach 10can be used for a wide range of linguistic phenomena and offers insights that cannot be found by using theoretical or experimental methods alone. Savinelli, Scontras, & Pearl (in press) demonstrate this by articulating a formal model of language understanding that accounts for how children and adults understand ambiguous utterances in context. For example, suppose you and a friend are watching horses jump over a fence, and two of three horses you watch make it over. Then suppose your friend turns to you and says, \"It looks like every horse didn't make it over the fence\" (every-not). You as an adult are able to interpret this as meaning \"Not all the horses made it over\" (which is true in this context), rather than interpreting it as \"All the horses didn't make it over\" (which is false in this context). However, four- and five-year-old children struggle to interpret this the way adults do, instead falling back on the false interpretation (All the horses didn't). By building a formal model that can match the qualitative behavior of both adults and children, we determined that the most likely cause of children's non-adult behavior was due to their developing abilities that manage conversational and real world context (pragmatic factors), rather than other equally plausible alternatives (e.g., not being able to generate the Not all interpretation in time - a processing factor). Interestingly, for other utterances, adults behave more like children in not being able to access the interpretation that is true in context. For example, suppose we watch two horses, and one jumps over a fence while the other doesn't. The utterance \"Two horses didn't jump over the fence\" (two- not) is true only under the interpretation of \"It is not the case that two horses jumped over the fence\" (because only one did), while it's false under the interpretation \"For each of two horses h, h didn't jump over the fence.\" In this case, adults typically struggle to access the true interpretation. Savinelli, Scontras, & Pearl (in prep.) demonstrate how the same formal model of language understanding that was able to capture children's interpretation behavior for the every- not scenario is able to account for adult interpretation behavior in the two-not scenario. Notably, adult behavior in the two-not scenarios has the same underlying pragmatic causes as children's non-adult behavior in the every-not scenarios. This suggests that there's continuity in the development of this kind of pragmatic context management when it comes to language understanding. Another finding by Pearl & Sprouse (in prep) concerns how children integrate different types of information when learning the linguistic behavior of verbs. In particular, verbs differ by the syntactic frames they can be used in and how their arguments are interpreted. For example, while both try and seem can be used in the frame The penguin ___ to climb the hill, only seem can be used in the frame It ___ that the penguin climbed the hill. As another example, both melt and climb can be used in the intransitive frame X ___ (The ice melted, The penguin climbed). However, the interpretation of the subject is different for each verb: in The ice melted, something is happening to the ice; in The penguin climbed, nothing is happening to the penguin \u2014 instead the penguin is doing something. Children learn these verb behaviors by inferring abstract classes of verbs, where each verb class has a distinct collection of behaviors. To do this, children draw on both syntactic cues (like syntactic frames) and conceptual cues (like animacy and event roles). By using a Bayesian framework to formally model different theories of how children integrate these 11information sources to learn verb classes, we were able to articulate the trajectory of learning assumptions children are likely to have from three to five years old. This trajectory suggests there are different timelines for ignoring vs. heeding surface morphology on verbs (like the past tense - ed in English), for a simpler vs. more flexible event role representation, and for not expecting vs. expecting a mapping between that event role representation and syntactic positions like subject, object, and indirect object. From a theoretical standpoint, it suggests that a mapping between event roles and syntactic positions is not present in younger children, and so is less likely to be something built into Universal Grammar (the innate, language-specific knowledge children utilize to learn their native languages so rapidly and so effectively). Another finding by Bates, Pearl, & Braunwald (in prep.) concerns the early emergence of syntactic category knowledge, such as not, no, and -n't belonging to an abstract category of Negation. The age when children develop knowledge of different syntactic categories is hotly contested, with some studies arguing for development before age two while others disagree. Experimental studies suggest that some open-class categories like Noun and Adjective (which can have new words added to them) may have early forms as young as 14 months old; in contrast, it's unclear when closed-class categories like Negation (which can't have new words added to it) are available. Using quantitative metrics that assess the underlying representations generating observable verb phrases, we found support for adult-like closed-class categories \u2014 but not for adult-like open-class categories \u2014 in a child just under the age of two. This provides empirical support for the very early development of closed-class categories. In particular, while only rudimentary forms of open-class categories may be available early in development, our findings suggest that more mature closed-class categories develop early. Both Pearl, Ho, & Detrano (in press) and Pearl (2017) also demonstrate the utility of formal modeling with a case study in English metrical phonology, which concerns the stress patterns that words have (e.g., emphasis has stress on the first syllable: EMphasis). While there are systematic patterns that English speakers unconsciously internalize and use, there's also a lot of \"noise\" \u2014 that is, English stress patterns that buck the normal trend and which English speakers effectively have to memorize. The noise in the input makes the process of acquiring English stress patterns a big challenge, and yet every typically developing English child gets it right. A current theory for why English children can manage this feat is that children come innately equipped with ideas about how human language stress systems operate. By taking this idea seriously, we can then investigate if the different proposals for the innate stress biases children have actually do make the acquisition of the English stress system possible. Both Pearl et al. (in press) and Pearl (2017) describe mathematical analyses of the input English children encounter that illuminate which innate stress representations are more helpful, when, and (most importantly) why. One interesting theoretical result is that many current proposals for the target stress knowledge of English would benefit from small changes that make this knowledge more easily learnable from the English data children actually encounter. If we don't make these changes, it's ridiculously hard to learn the \"right\" English stress knowledge from English data.12Pearl & Phillips (in press) uses computational modeling to investigate the task of speech segmentation, which is the process of identifying individual units like words in fluent speech. As anyone who has ever listened to a foreign language knows, there are rarely any overt markers of word boundaries - it often sounds like one long stream of sounds. Instead, listeners who know the language unconsciously impose boundaries to identify the words being spoken. Infants typically are able to do this for their native language as early as six months old. In our studies, we examine two speech segmentation strategies proposed for infant use, implement these strategies concretely via mathematical formalizations, and apply them to realistic language data that infants would hear. One interesting problem concerns the evaluation of these segmentation strategies \u2014 given how young children are segmenting speech (six months), it seems unlikely they would achieve perfect adult segmentation immediately. In fact, we know that segmentation errors persist for several years after (ex: undersegmentation errors like \"That's a\" segmented as a single word \"thatsa\", and oversegmentation errors like \"behave\" segmented as \"be\" and \"have\"). So how do we tell if a segmentation strategy is generating good enough segmentations (and importantly, the kind a six-month-old might generate)? We discuss assessing the utility of the generated output, with the idea that language acquisition is a process that unfolds over several years. So, the output of one process is the input to the next. Using various ideas for what segmented output might be used for later on in acquisition, we discover that segmentation strategies that produce more adult- like segmentations may not be the best ones for infants to have. Instead, strategies that generate undersegmentation errors may actually be preferable to ones that generate ovrsegmentation errors, irrespective of which strategy generates a more adult-like segmentation. Bar-Sever, Lee, Scontras, & Pearl (in prep.) use corpus analysis to investigate the development of adjective ordering preferences, which determine the relative ordering of adjectives in multi- adjective strings. This is why \"small gray kitten\" is preferable to \"gray small kitten\" in English and many other unrelated languages. Recent work by Scontras and colleagues suggested that ordering preferences are related to the perceived subjectivity of the adjective (i.e., If I say, \"The kitten is gray\" and you say \"The kitten isn't gray\", can we both be right? If so, this is a subjective adjective.) Using corpus analysis of English child-directed and child-produced speech, we found that child-directed speech hyperarticulates subjectivity-based adjective ordering preferences (similar to how child-directed speech hyperarticulates other aspects of the language to presumably make a cleaner input signal for the child). Additionally, adult-like subjectivity-based ordering preferences emerge as early as two years old. This underscores the salience of subjectivity in the development of adjective ordering preferences, which contrasts sharply with prior explanations that relied on innately available semantic classes. Nguyen & Pearl (in press) also use corpus analysis to investigate children's understanding of the passive construction in English. For example, at three, children can understand \"Alex was hugged by Emma\" but struggle to correctly understand \"Alex was loved by Emma\" until age five. Several factors have been proposed to explain the general delay in understanding passives, including verb frequency and the lexical semantics of the verb. Corpus analysis coupled with a meta-analysis of 12 experimental studies suggested that the lexical semantic profile of a verb strongly influenced when children understood the verb's passive form, and suggested a 13developmental trajectory that qualitatively matched the available experimental results. This contrasted strongly with verb frequency factors, which didn't have any correlation. This finding makes specific predictions about the age when children should understand certain verbs in the passive and not others, based on the collection of lexical semantic features the verb has. Sociological/Anthropological John Boyd The chapter \"Network analysis\" with Willianm H. Batchelder is now published as Chapter 4 pp. 194\u2014273 in the New Handbook of Mathematical Psychology Vol. 1. Eds. William H. Batchelder, Hans Colonius, Ehtibar Dzhafarov, and Jay Myung, published by the Cambridge University Press, 2017. This chapter maintains a high level of modesty in that neither I nor my coauthors cites himself. Of course, we are very proud of this achievement. Current project: 1. William H. Batchelder and I are exploring ways of determining the dimensionality of data using simulation studies and statistical models. 2. Again with Batchelder, we are applying an advanced algebraic techniques, Gr\u00f6bner Bases, to generalize the Spearman's law of tetrads and Kelley's law of pentads. The goal here is also to determine the dimensionality of data. 3. A.K.Romney and I are using orthogonal polynomials, the so-called Jacobi polynomials, to efficiently describe color vision. Carter Butts One of the workhorse techniques of the physical sciences is spectroscopy. Spectroscopy is a broad family of techniques that exploits the fact that many phenomena have natural patterns of regular, periodic behavior that act as \"fingerprints\" for the underlying process: find the repeating pattern in a system's behavior, and you often have very strong evidence about what gave rise to it. Importantly, the spectral signature of a given process can often be seen in averaged, bulk signals from large and even heterogeneous systems, making spectroscopy a go-to when trying to identify the composition or behavior of a system that must be observed from a distance, or for which the components cannot be directly isolated. Familiar examples of spectroscopic applications include the absorption and emission spectra that allow us to know the composition of materials ranging from distant stars and nebula to food and medicines here on Earth, and the magnetic resonance spectra that form the basis of medical imaging techniques such as MRI and fMRI. The success of spectroscopic methods in making sense of bulk signals from complex systems raises a question: can similar approaches be leveraged to study social systems? Historically, the lack of time-resolved data on human activity (with a few exceptions, such as financial time series) meant that the answer to this question was \"no.\" This situation is now changing. Thanks to sources such as mobile device data, it is increasingly possible to obtain aggregated data on human 14behavior (including movement, communication, activities, and such) with time resolution on the order of seconds to minutes. This new capability opens the potential for social spectroscopy as a practical scientific direction. In a recent paper, my group has demonstrated that such an approach can indeed work. In particular, we show that simple activity and environmental data from mobile devices - such as whether the device is being used to communicate, or how many other devices are in the vicinity - can be used to infer shared social contexts such as belonging to the same workgroup or even being friends. The essence of this approach (which we call activity correlation spectroscopy) is that shared social contexts are associated with periodic synchronization and desynchronization in the behavior of individuals. When in the same social environment as another person, our activities and environmental observations become correlated with theirs, this correlation being lost when we separate. Since many social contexts bring people together at regular intervals, this leaves a spectral fingerprint in the sequence of correlations between activity series, allowing the hidden context to be inferred. This work builds on our earlier results showing that spectral methods can likewise be used to infer the ecology of urban areas and the degree to which events in one place impact activity elsewhere, demonstrating that social spectroscopy to be employed to study social systems from the microscopic to the macroscopic level. We are excited at the prospects for these methods to unlock both new ways of studying social systems and new types of questions to investigate regarding social process, and believe that this has the potential to open up an entirely new research area. Individual Decision-Making Michael Birnbaum When people are asked to make decisions between alternatives in which one option is definitely better than the other option, people often select the worse option. Further, in other tests of behavior considered \"rational\", people often make combinations of choices that are not compatible with the theory that people obey principles considered rational. It is also the case that when presented on more than one occasion with the same choice problem, people will often express different preferences on different occasions. Do people change their minds, or do they simply make random choices on some occasions? I have been studying why people make different decisions to the same choice problem and how we can test theories of human decision making when people are not consistent. A mathematical model has been developed that allows the researcher to find out what proportion of inconsistencies of choice are due to true violations of rational principles, what proportion is due to people changing their minds about a decision problem, and what proportion is due to random error. Robin Keller For the last thirty years, researchers in risk analysis, decision analysis, and economics have consistently proven that decision makers employ different processes for evaluating and combining anticipated and actual losses, gains, delays and surprises. While rational models generally prescribe a consistent response, people's heuristic processes will sometimes lead them to be15inconsistent in the way they respond to information presented in theoretically equivalent ways. Keller and Wang point out several promising future research directions by listing and detailing a series of answered, partly answered, and unanswered questions. Perception and Psychophysics Kimberly A. Jameson During 2016-2017 Kimberly A. Jameson continued research along six related areas of empirical investigation and basic research and development. (1) As founding P.I., Jameson continues to serve as Project Lead for collaborative Discovery Eye Foundation Funded empirical and theoretical work on Adult Macular Degeneration (AMD) and color photopigment opsin genetics in collaboration with Maria Cristina Kenney MD PhD at the Gavin Herbert Eye Institute in UC Irvine Medical School. This project has recently received awards for extending the work to establish, among other advances, a Core Opsin Genotyping Facility which will develop a novel, internationally shared resource for academic/scientific researchers, providing full human photopigment opsin genotyping assessment and profiling. This is a resource that currently does not exist for basic research purposes and which would greatly enhance investigations internationally that aim to investigate basic and clinical research efforts related to Rhodopsin and Photopigment opsin genetics. (2) Jameson continues her collaboration with Vladimir Bochko (Vaasa University, Finland) and Keith Goldfarb (Blackthorn Media, Los Angeles, CA) on the development of image processing algorithms and filters for depicting color scene processing variations across observers with dissimilar photopigment opsin phenotypes, yielding two IMBS technical reports (and a third substantially revised IMBS technical report). (3) On her National Science Foundation funded research Jameson led research into the mathematical modeling of color category evolution among communicating artificial agents (with IMBS affiliates Louis Narens Cognitive Sciences and Natalia Komarova, Mathematics) which yielded a publication in JOSAA, an IMBS technical report, and two research manuscripts. With Komarova (as doctoral thesis chair), Jameson and Narens also assisted and advised Department of Mathematics Graduate Student Nicole Fider on thesis research which has now been developed into manuscripts. (4) Jameson also continues her collaborations with A. Kimball Romney & Tim Satalich, IMBS faculty, and most notably Kirbi Joe MBS Graduate Student, on developing novel psychophysical investigations of color perception metameric relations. (5) Jameson also ran a cognitive research lab ( imbs.uci.edu/colorcoglab/ColorCognitionLab.html) consisting of Psychology and Social Behavior undergraduates on empirical investigations into individual variation and universals in human color cognition, color naming and categorization. During 2016-2017 this group engaged in statistical analyses and research the literature towards manuscript preparation for results on the topic of bilingual individuals naming and conceptualization of color.16(6) Also for her NSF funded research, Jameson continued implementation and management of the public research resource ColCat: Color Categorization Wiki, assisted by Sergio Gago PhD, in Calit2 for the NSF funded project. Kim Romney I am engaged with my colleagues at Irvine in ongoing research to develop modals of human color appearance that have sufficient resolving power to predict individual differences in color perception. To model the color appearance of an object color requires knowledge of three variables: the reflectance spectrum of the object, the illuminant, and the sensitivity curves of the three photoreceptors (cones) in the retina. It turns out that there are considerable differences among individuals as to where the peak sensitivity of the three cones are located. Geneticists have discovered that they can predict the peak sensitivity curves of the cones from the individual's DNA. A group of Irvine researchers (including myself, Tim Satalich, Kimberly Jameson, and Louis Narens) have volunteered our DNA for examination and found differences in where our cones peak in sensitivity. We are collaborating on research to see if our models can predict differences in perceptual tests of our color appearance. We are in the process of doing pretests on the perceptual and psychophysical tasks. We hope to be the first to develop tests with enough resolving power to detect individual differences in perceptual tasks in color appearance. Jack Yellott In May, I reported the following findings at the Vision Sciences Society Annual Meeting. When an eye viewing incoherent monochromatic objects is out of focus by a diopter or more, the amplitude component of its optical transfer function consists entirely of rings of delta functions corresponding to the spatial frequencies made invisible by defocus. In the image domain each ring corresponds to a set of spatial sign waves that all have the same frequency, but differ in orientation and (possibly) phase. For a given frequency the sum of all such sign waves will be some zero-order Bessel function, which should be invisible regardless of its physical contrast. The entire null space of such an eye is the sum of these Bessel functions. Visual stimuli was distributed during the talk to allow the audience to visualize this in their own eyes. Social and Economic Phenomena David Brownstone Professor Michael McBride and I are building an experimental platform to examine drivers' route choice behavior in a laboratory setting where we can control the information they receive. Our setup allows us to vary information about congestion on the road ahead as well as real-time toll pricing. By varying the endowments of the experimental subjects we can also control their value of time, and this allows us to test current theories about road pricing with heterogeneous values of time. We find that drivers do respond to credible information about road conditions, but their response is not optimal. This suggests that we can design information and tolling systems that 17will improve the performance of our highway networks. This year we extended our experiments to include adult subjects across the U.S. using the Amazon Mechanical Turk platform. We find that the results are very similar to those obtained with UCI undergraduates in our experimental laboratory. Jan K. Brueckner Carbon emissions from the airline industry have gained prominence in recent years, and one policy tool for dealing with them is an emissions charge per gallon of jet fuel. While such a charge would hasten the adoption of more fuel-efficient aircraft in the long-run, it could also have short-run effects by leading to greater fuel conservation efforts in operation of the current fleets of passenger jets. This view is confirmed by results in a recently published paper of mine, which show that, holding aircraft characteristics (i.e., vintage) and operating features (stage length, load factor) of aircraft fleets constant, an optimal emissions charge of 39 cents per gallon would reduce fuel usage by 2%, with a resulting environmental benefit of $117 per year. Although the sources of this change cannot be seen in the data, they presumably include actions such as flying at lower speeds, taxiing on one engine, carrying less reserve fuel, and installation of fuel-saving winglets. Jean-Paul Carvalho This year I was promoted to Associate Professor (with tenure) and received the Dean's Award for outstanding teaching in the social sciences. I had one article published, produced an NBER working paper and commenced a new project on religious communities. I delivered eight research presentations. In terms of service, I co-organized two conferences, organized one workshop, co-organized two quarters of the Theory, History and Development Seminar, served as faculty instructor for the ASREC Economics of Religion Graduate Workshop and as a discussant at two conferences/workshops. I refereed a number of papers for leading journals. I also chaired the committee for the Jean-Claude Falmagne Dissertation Award. I supervised two students with IMBS related interests: Cole Williams and Pat Testa. John Duffy I have some new work on information aggregation and social learning. In one project, with S. Bhattacharya and S. Kim, we have explored incentives for individuals to obtain costly and informative private information prior to voting. Theoretically, as the number of voters gets large, voting according to majority rule should provide better information aggregation of voters' private information. At the same time, as the number of voters increases, the incentives for voters to acquire costly information prior to voting decline, as it is less likely that their vote will be pivotal to the election outcome. We test these predictions in a laboratory experiment, where we find that increases in the number of voters does indeed reduce individual's frequency of information acquisition but, due to risk aversion, subjects over-acquire information relative to theoretical predictions. This paper was recently published in Games and Economic Behavior, 2017.18In a second working paper on social learning, I am exploring with. E. Hopkins and T. Kornienko the information that individuals choose when they try to forecast a binary state of the world that is subject to change over time. In our theory, if the state of the world is sufficiently persistent, then it is best response for individuals to look to past \"social information\" about others' forecasts of the state of the world. However, if the state of the world is more erratic, then a best response is to consult one's own more up to date \"private information\". In an experiment we find that most subjects respond rationally to changes in the persistence of the state, but there is a significant fraction of people who always choose social information or private information regardless of changes in the persistence of the state they are seeking to forecast. We label such types \"herd animals\" and \"lone wolves\". Thus we find that there is a mix of bias and rationality in social information choice settings. Steve Frank In a prior article from early in 2016, \"Common probability patterns arise from simple invariances,\" I showed that a few simple assumptions about conservation and invariance lead to a nearly complete framework for understanding the commonly observed probability patterns in nature. This year, I published two new articles that illustrate how to apply the general invariance theory of probability patterns to widely discussed problems in biology and other disciplines. This fundamental work *should* become a primary aspect of how scientists interpret natural pattern. However, given the culture of science and the mistaken tendency to cling to historical rather than conceptual precedent, it will likely be several years before these ideas get \"rediscovered.\" The first article, \"Invariant death,\" considers the typical form for plots of death rate versus age. Those curves of death may be associated with extreme value distributions. However, a much deeper structure provides more insight. In particular, a generalized Gompertz law follows from simple affine invariances of shift and stretch. That generalized Gompertzian form provides a simple basis for understanding the geometry and mathematical expression for nearly all commonly observed probability patterns. No other approach unifies the diverse forms of the common continuous probability distributions in such a simple and comprehensive way. The second article, \"The invariances of power law size distributions,\" politely deconstructs the silly over-interpretation of commonly observed power law size distributions. More importantly, I show that a generalized notion of the variance as the average distance of fluctuations measured on the properly invariant measurement scale unifies commonly observed probability patterns by a simple transformation of the Gaussian distribution. By this view, power law size distributions are simple Gaussian patterns that can be understood by the central limit theorem, or perhaps more fundamentally, by the essential affine invariances of shift and stretch plus the additional invariance of rotation (order independence). My way of expressing these relations shows very clearly how to read the classical Gaussian form as a simple sentence about invariant properties, 19and how that form connects naturally to patterns that, at first, appear very different, such as power laws. Along these lines, I also published \"Universal expressions of population change by the Price equation: natural selection, information, and maximum entropy production.\" I showed that the seemingly trivial conservation of total probability provides the basis for understanding the common form of fundamental results in many different fields of study. In essence, the dynamics of probability distributions must always follow contours along conserved total probability. That constraint allows one to partition total change into, first, what can reasonably be called a response to directly applied forces, holding constant the frame of reference, and second, the changes in the inertial frame of reference. The classic expressions of evolutionary change by natural selection then relate simply to many classic expressions in physics and in other subjects, once one sees clearly the abstract geometric basis of the underlying structure. I also published a variety of essays on key unsolved problems in biology. Bernie Grofman Grofman's work has been in two areas of voting rights. On the one hand of the area of racial representation, Grofman most recently served as the Special Master in a Virginia congressional case Personhuballah v. Alcorn. In that case, working for the federal court, he redrew Virginia's 3rd congressional district after it had been held to be an unconstitutional racial gerrymander. The plan he prepared reduced unnecessary packing of black voting strength in CD 3 while still allowing for the reelection of an African American incumbent. Excess black population was moved to an adjoining district that subsequently elected an African American candidate in 2016. With respect to partisan gerrymandering, Grofman has long been an opponent and has been involved in cases challenging partisan gerrymanders. Most recently, as senior author of an amicus brief in a Wisconsin US Supreme Court Case, in which a lower court overturned Wisconsin's legislative plan as an unconstitutional partisan gerrymander, he proposed a new three part standard for partisan gerrymandering. Marek Kaminski Most of my recent work has been connected to the topic of electoral reform that has been floating in Polish politics since 2014. I have given several lectures and presentations for top Polish politicians, wrote an introductory paper, and, most recently, completed a book that was intended to provide the main source of references on electoral reform introducing single-member districts. In the book, I discuss both empirical findings on SMDs and the formal properties of voting methods in the context of Polish politics.20Igor Kopylov This year I published a paper \"Commitments and Weak Resolve\" in Economic Theory (jointly with J. Noor from BU). In the accepted revision, we added some new testable motivation for studying weak resolve in terms self-imposed deadlines. Second, I have completed a research project on \"Framing in Expected Utility and Multiple Priors Modes\" and presented it at several seminars and conferences (including North American Meeting of Econometric Society). Some new insights in that project include an axiomatic classification of several framing models under uncertainty and an endogenous definition of unframable \"small worlds\". Third, I have completed an experimental project \"Subjective Beliefs and Confidence When Facts Are Forgotten\" (jointly with J. Miller from Bocconi University). In addition to some novel types of overconfidence and ambiguity aversion patterns, we have developed a behavioral model of beliefs under imperfect recall. Natalia Komarova The fascinating ability of humans to modify the linguistic input and ``create'' a language has been widely discussed. In the work of Elissa Newport and colleagues, it has been demonstrated that both children and adults have some ability to process inconsistent linguistic input and ``improve'' it by making it more consistent. One example is the fascinating study of the performance of a 7- year deaf boy Simon, who mastered the American Sign Language (ASL) by learning it from his parents, both of whom were imperfect speakers of ASL. In a number of papers, Newport and colleagues studied artificial miniature language acquisition from an inconsistent source. It was shown that (i) children are better at language regularization than adults, and that (ii) adults can also regularize, depending on the structure of the input. Together with graduate student Timmy Ma we created a number of learning algorithms of the reinforcement-learning type, which exhibits interesting patterns consistent wit those observed by Newport. Mathematical analysis of those patterns suggests a way to explain them. In the last year Timmy Ma and I have also performed experiments on human learning, focusing on learning from an inconsistent source. We are investigating feature-label order (FLO) in the efficiency of learning and robustness against noise. Another set of projects that I worked on with grad student Nicole Fider and in collaboration with Kimberly Jameson and Louis Narens is understanding color categorization in humans. In particular, we used the data collected in the World Color Survey to study the number of basic color terms that evolved in different cultures. We are also studying the shape of color category boundaries and investigating the role of gender in color categorization.21Over the last year I have also worked on several topics of mathematical biology. This includes stochastic dynamics of stem cells; virus dynamics, and investigating the role of spatial constraints in crossing fitness valleys in evolutionary dynamics. Michael McBride With a co-author, I experimentally studied the relationship between theory of mind ability and cooperativeness. We found that higher theory of mind subjects are more likely to find cooperators and more likely to avoid defectors than low theory of mind subjects. Doing so yields high payoff advantages for high theory of mind subjects. Andrew Noymer I work on demography, with an emphasis on health in general and mortality in particular. The human population is a complex system in constant motion among many dimensions; as such, my work fits very well in the IMBS rubric. My work in the recent past has focused on emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases, as well as cancer. I have also worked on nonlinear models of measles epidemiology recently, with a paper on this subject published during the period. Cailin O'Connor This year my research focused on the emergence of norms, especially those regulating bargaining and coordination, between different social groups such as men and women, and people of different races. I produced several new working papers, one modeling the interplay between discrimination and collaboration networks in academia, one modeling the dynamics of bargaining in intersectional groups, one on the cultural Red King effect, whereby minority groups can be disadvantaged by dint of their size. The manuscript of my monograph Dynamics of Inequity: how categories like gender and race impact cultural evolution, and what it means for fairness is now available upon request, and discusses these papers as well as a much more extensive exploration of the cultural evolution of inequitable norms. Don Saari Several years ago, while working on a NSF grant to identify the methodological source of difficulties in nanotechnology, I discovered that what caused the main problem in nanotechnology is that, to reduce the complexity, the field is using the commonly accepted reductionist approach. This is where a complex problem is reduced to more tractable parts, solutions for the parts are found, and then these component solutions are assembled to answer the original problem. The difficulty, as I proved, is the last part of assembling answers from the parts into a solution for the whole. A succinct way to capture the difficulty is with the well known \"The whole can differ from the sum of the parts.\" Namely, answers from the parts need not explain the whole.22As I also discovered, this reductionist approach with its \"systems analysis\" complexity, arises almost everywhere in essentially all disciplines. Part of my research this year has been to explore where this difficulty arises in totally unexpected places, and then find ways around the difficulties. Examples include the famous Arrow's Theorem. Now, this is the commonly referenced result, which some claim asserts that \"there does not exist a fair voting system for three or more alternatives.\" How can this result be identified with the Reductionist method? Well, one of Arrow's conditions is to find voting methods that are consistent with a pairwise analysis (his \"independence of irrelevant alternatives, or IIA,\" which is easy to prove that IIA is equivalent to the reductionist approach. Consequently, by reintroducing \"information about how the parts are connected,\" which is dismissed in the reductionist approach and by IIA, simple and acceptable resolutions for Arrow's problem follow immediately. Moving from the social science to the physical sciences, one of the most compelling scientific mysteries is the problem of dark matter in galaxies. As a quick introduction, standard methods to determine the amount of mass in a galaxy produce values that are nowhere near the amount of mass needed to keep stars from escaping and causing a galaxy to dissipate. Dark matter is the conjectured, hidden mass, that is needed to keep galaxies in a stable manner consistent with observations. Now, how is the mass of a galaxy determined? A galaxy involves billions of stars, which corresponds to the Newtonian billion-body problem\u2014which has not been solved. As a result, astrophysicists are forced to invent approximations. The main one is where the mass of galaxy closer to a particular star is approximated by a two-body system (this is not the derivation, but it follows from the conclusion). The two bodies are the star and the second is all of the mass (i.e., all of the stars) closer to the center of mass. But by using two-body approximations, the galactic mass question becomes using a billion two-body approximations\u2014one for each star. This is the reductionist approach, where the parts (answers from each approximations) need not have anything to do with what happens for the whole! In this manner, I have been able to show that the current methods of predicting mass are exponentially wrong, and I am creating approaches to obtain more realistic mass values. I also am exploring where these difficulties arise, in unexpected ways, in other mysteries. A second theme concerns a decomposition of games into the component that captures individual objectives and the component that captures objectives achievable only by players cooperating. Consequences and extensions of this work with Dan Jessie were explored. Rein Taagepera Re: Shugart Taagepera, Votes from Seats (2017) Take the number of seats in a representative assembly and the number of seats in districts through which this assembly is elected. From just these two numbers, the authors of Votes from Seats show that it is possible to deduct the number of parties in the assembly and in the electorate, as 23well as the size of the largest party. Four laws of party seats and votes are constructed by logic and tested, using scientific approaches rare in social sciences. The ability to predict so much from so little, and to apply to countries worldwide, is an advance in the systematic analysis of a core institutional feature found in any democracy, and points the way towards making social sciences more predictive. Re: \"Science walks on two legs, but social sciences try to hop on one\" (2017). Science walks on two legs. One leg consists of asking: How things are? This leads to observation, measurement, graphing, and statistical description. The other leg consists of asking: How things should be, on logical grounds? This leads to logical models that should become quantitatively predictive. Science largely consists of such models, tested with data. Developed science establishes not only connections among individual factors but also connections among these connections. But social sciences often take the lazy road of fitting raw data with a straight line or some fashionable format, unaware of the need to think and build models based on logic. As expounded in my Making Social Sciences More Scientific (Oxford UP 2008) and Logical Models and Basic Numeracy in Social Sciences, http://www.psych.ut.ee/stk/Beginners_Logical_Models.pdf , I call for a major widening in social science methodology.

Research Laboratories Mathematical Reasoning for the Sciences Faculty Organizer: Don Saari As labeled by the students, \"Don squad.\" This weekly discussion group identifies and discusses research issues coming from the social and behavioral sciences. An interesting aspect is how a goal is to identify what kinds of mathematics needs to be invented, or modified, to address these issues. Weekly meeting times scheduled each quarter to accommodate class and teaching schedules. Experimental Social Science Laboratory (ESSL) Faculty Organizer: Mike McBride The Experimental Social Science Laboratory (ESSL) is a computer laboratory for the experimental study of individual and interactive decision making. Located at SBSG 1240, the laboratory can conduct computer-based experiments of up to 40 subjects, but ESSL also has capabilities to conduct internet-based experiments. ESSL is available for use by researchers of all social scientific disciplines who conduct experiments according to the standards of experimental economics. ESSL personnel are affiliated with many departments in the UCI School of Social Science, including Economics, Anthropology, Cognitive Sciences, Logic and Philosophy of Science, Political Science, and Sociology, and also with departments in the School of Social Ecology and Paul Merage School of Business. Social Network Research Group (SNRG) Faculty Organizer: Carter Butts The objective of the UCI Social Network Research Group is to provide an informal setting for discussion of current and ongoing network-related research at UCI (and elsewhere), facilitate the exchange of information regarding new techniques, tools, data sources, and research findings, support graduate student training in the network field, and encourage collaboration among faculty and students on network-related topics. The SNRG meets weekly throughout the academic year, at a time and place that is determined on a quarterly basis. Attendance is open to all interested members of the university community, and \"drop-ins\" are welcome. Meets on Wednesdays from 3:30-4:30 p.m. in Calit2 3355. The SNRG also is an activity of the UCI Center for Networks and Relational Analysis (www.relationalanalysis.org). Cognition and Color Reading Group Research Organizer: Kimberly Jameson A weekly discussion group of published research articles, or participants' on-going research interests, on topics of cognition and color perception. Topics covered in recent years include: Color perception correlates of photopigment opsin genes, psychophysical investigations of heterochromatic luminance discrimination, adaptive optics imaging of the human retina, comparative color vision behavior, neural correlates of human color perception, individual variation and color perception, color vision diagnostics and clinical applications, etc. Research topics discussed typically focus on higher-order aspects of color processing, exploring front-end 25processing issues when they bear on phenomenology. Meeting location: 2142 Meeting time: Fridays, 11:00 am - 12:30 pm; meeting dates designated at the beginning of each quarter. Schedule posted at: http://www.imbs.uci.edu/~kjameson/ColorCogFALL2015.html Social Dynamics Faculty Organizer: Brian Skyrms Social Dynamics is a research seminar, where graduate students and faculty present research projects, and there is vigorous critical discussion. Instructors: Louis Narens, Don Saari, and Brian Skyrms Meets fall quarter on Tuesdays, 2:00 - 5:00 p.m. on 7th floor of the Social Science Tower Computational Models of Language Reading Group (CoLa) Faculty Organizer: Lisa Pearl Topics of interest for the group include computational models of language learning, computational learning theory, principles underlying models of language acquisition and language change, and models of information extraction from language by humans. We meet four times a quarter for about an hour, and it's usually a nicely feisty discussion. Day/time to meet will be updated on the website. IV. GRADUATE TRAINING A. Ph.D. Students Louis Narens is the Director of the MBS graduate program. Others on the graduate committee who assist Professor Narens are Professors Marek Kaminski and Michael McBride. Working with the faculty of the Institute are 9 Ph.D. students, of whom 1 graduated this academic year. We are admitting 2 new MBS students fall quarter. The following is our current roster of students enrolled in the Ph.D. program in Mathematical Behavioral Sciences during the current academic year. They are listed in Appendix F. Nikhil Addleman Calvin Zhao *Graduated in 2016-2017 Noted academic and research related achievements by our MBS graduate students include Junying Zhao's Andrew Vincent White and Florence Wales White Scholarship for the 2016-17 academic 26year. The $20,000 scholarship awarded for her work, \"Hippocratic Paradox and Irrational Consensu: A Mathematical Behavioral Analysis of Medical Decision-Making.\" IMBS supported participation of Economics graduate student Cole Williams at the International Economic Association Roundtable on The Economics of Religion at Cambridge University over the summer. B. Graduate Activities While the formal part of our graduate program is small, the actual impact on the UCI graduate program is more extensive. This is because several graduate students from other programs participate on a regular basis with our weekly Friday lecture section and our annual graduate conference. This past year the MBS graduate students organized student meetings with weekly colloquia speakers. This gives students an opportunity to interact and network with professors. One of the goals is to gain insight into how students perceive IMBS and how to facilitate more involvement of the social science student body. C. Friday Research Presentations This IMBS activity was coordinated Jean-Paul Carvalho and directed by graduate student and participant Santiago Guisasola. Weekly research meetings give space for graduate students and faculty to gather on Fridays from Noon- 1:00 p.m. in the Luce Conference Room to introduce research they are working on. The presentations are followed by discussion periods afterwards. Below is the list of the presentations for the year: October 7 MARK C.

Duncan Luce Graduate Student Conference IMBS sponsors a yearly graduate student conference where students in the MBS program, as well as other students whose research interests are related to MBS, present their research. The graduate organizers of the 15th Annual conference were MBS graduate students Nikhil Addleman, Maryam Gooyabadi, and Santiago Guisasola. With so much interest by the graduate students to present, this year we expanded from a one-day to a two-day conference.

Jean-Claude Falmagne Dissertation Award Each year, IMBS presents the Jean-Claude Falmagne Dissertation Award to a graduate student for the best dissertation that uses mathematics to develop conceptual advances for issues coming from the social and behavioral sciences. Going beyond the use of mathematics for computational purposes, the intent is to award a dissertation that uses concepts from mathematics to reach new conclusions. The prize is $1,500. Last year IMBS selected Michael Sacks, 2016 graduate of Economics for his dissertation, \"The Economics of Collaborative Production and Consumption with Applications in Digital Technologies.\" Graduate Hannah Rubin receives this year's IMBS Jean-Claude Falmagne Dissertation Award for her dissertation, \"The Explanatory Value of Inclusive Fitness for Evolutionary Theory.\" The award is given for the best dissertation that uses mathematics to develop conceptual advances for issues coming from the social and behavioral sciences. Going beyond the use of mathematics for computational purposes, the intent is to award a dissertation that uses concepts from mathematics to reach new conclusions.31Hannah received her Bachelor's degree in philosophy and religious studies from the University of Missouri in 2011. From UC Irvine, she earned her PhD in Philosophy in 2017. Hannah is working in philosophy of science, in particular the philosophy of biology. Her dissertation is about the conceptual and formal foundations of inclusive fitness theory. Recently, she also received the 2017 Order of Merit Award for Outstanding Scholarship of the School of Social Sciences. Hannah is currently a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Groningen (Netherlands). She will start a tenure track position at the Philosophy Department of the University of Notre Dame in Fall 2018. V. COMMUNICATION A.

University of Connecticut, Storrs, 2016. C. Visitors During the fall quarter IMBS hosted Mark Wilson, Director at the Centre for Mathematical Social Sciences and Senior Lecturer at the Department of Computer Science at the University of Auckland. Associate Researcher Tim Satalich continues work with Professor Kim Romney, and Project Scientist Robert Forbes continues work with Professor Louis Narens. D. IMBS Colloquia Series During the academic year the Institute conducts a weekly colloquia series with speakers from both inside as well as outside the Institute.

Appeared online in early view prior to print: Information Presentation in Decision and Risk Analysis: Answered, Partly Answered, and Unanswered Questions, Version of Record online: 21 SEP 2016 | DOI: 10.1111/risa.12697 Abstract Article PDF(120K) References60For the last thirty years, researchers in risk analysis, decision analysis, and economics have consistently proven that decision makers employ different processes for evaluating and combining anticipated and actual losses, gains, delays and surprises. While rational models generally prescribe a consistent response, people's heuristic processes will sometimes lead them to be inconsistent in the way they respond to information presented in theoretically equivalent ways. We point out several promising future research directions by listing and detailing a series of answered, partly answered, and unanswered questions. Luping Sun, Xiaona Zheng, Meng Su, L. Robin Keller (2017), \"Intention-Behavior Discrepancy of Foreign versus Domestic Brands in Emerging Markets: The Relevance of Consumer Prior Knowledge,\" Journal of International Marketing, published by the American Marketing Association, Vol. 25, No. 1, pp. 91-109, accepted October 20, 2016. doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.1509/jim.15.0123. Most research on the performance of foreign versus domestic brands in emerging markets examines measures of product evaluation or purchase intention. However, consumers intending to buy a product may switch to competing brands, displaying an intention-behavior discrepancy (IBD). Drawing upon literature on country associations and dual process theory, we examine the difference in IBD of foreign versus domestic brands in emerging markets and the moderating role of prior knowledge. We conducted an intention survey followed by a post-purchase survey in the Chinese automobile and smartphone industries. We found that foreign brands have an advantage on IBD relative to domestic brands, indicating that they have the dual advantage of higher evaluations and lower IBDs. Furthermore, foreign brands' advantage on IBD is smaller for consumers with inaccurate prior knowledge, as they are more likely to systematically reprocess information and discount foreign brands' favorable country associations. For these consumers, overestimating the product reduces foreign brands' advantage to a smaller degree than underestimating it due to confirmation bias. These findings provide implications for brands in emerging markets.

Permanent link: http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/EJM-07-2014- 0457. Purpose - This article examines how a person's thinking style, specifically holistic versus analytic, and a firm's crisis apology with the remedial solution framed in \"why\" (vs. \"how\") terms can interactively impact consumers' perceived efficacy of the firm to respond to the crisis and their impression or evaluation of the brand.61Design/methodology/approach - Hypotheses were tested through three experimental studies involving 308 participants recruited in China. Participants answered survey questions investigating the interactive effects from consumers' thinking style (culture as a proxy in study 1, measured in study 2 or primed in study 3) and a brand's crisis apology with the remedial solution framed in \"why\" (vs. \"how\") terms on consumers' perceived efficacy and evaluation of the firm. Findings -The frame of the remedial solution resulting in a higher evaluation improvement depended on a consumer's thinking style. For holistic thinkers, a \"why\" (vs. \"how\") framed remedial solution resulted in a higher evaluation improvement; however, for analytic thinkers, a \"how\" (vs. \"why\") framed remedial solution resulted in a higher evaluation improvement. Additionally, the results showed that a consumer's perceived efficacy of the brand being able to successfully respond to the crisis mediated the interactive effects of the remedial solution framing and thinking styles on the evaluation improvement. Research limitations/implications - Different ways of framing the remedial solution in a firm's apology will have different impacts on people with different thinking styles. Participants in studies 2 and 3 were recruited from samples on campus in China. Additionally, the automobile brand used in this study is fictional to avoid prior brand name or brand commitment impact. Practical implications - Our findings provide evidence that framing of the remedial solution can be leveraged as a tool to reduce negative impact resulting from a brand crisis. Specifically, our results suggest that companies may do well to employ a \"why\" framed remedial solution, particularly in cases where consumers are likely to process information holistically. Conversely, a \"how\" framed remedial solution may be effective in situations where consumers are likely to process information analytically. Originality/value - This research contributes to the literature, being among the first to consider how the remedial solution framing in a firm's apology can enhance people's evaluation of the brand and decrease the perceived negative impact resulting from the brand crisis.

This paper was written in Spanish (and English) to facilitate communication with Spanish- speaking scholars in Cuba and elsewhere, who aim to conduct Markov cost effectiveness analyses 62and would benefit from low cost software alternatives. The working paper is in English and Spanish versions: investigacion_operacional_2016_06_28_Bai_delCampo_Keller_English, investigacion_operacional_2016_Bai_delCampo_Keller Markov processes (or Markov chains) are used for modeling a phenomenon in which changes over time of a random variable comprise a sequence of values in the future, each of which depends only on the immediately preceding state, not on other past states. A Markov process (PM) is completely characterized by specifying the finite set S of possible states and the stationary probabilities (i.e. time-invariant) of transition between these states. The software most used in medical applications is produced by TreeAge, since it offers many advantages to the user. But, the cost of the TreeAge software is relatively high. Therefore in this article two software alternatives are presented: Sto Tree and the zero cost add-in program \"markovchain\" implemented in R. An example of a cost-effectiveness analysis of two possible treatments for advanced cervical cancer, previously conducted with the Treeage software, is re-analyzed with these two low cost software packages.

Monk, Krishnansu Sujata Tewari, \"Evaluating the cost-effectiveness of current FDA-approved PARP inhibitors for the treatment of recurrent ovarian cancer\", American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) conference, June 3, 2017, Chicago, Poster abstract (suppl; abstr 5516), http://abstracts.asco.org/199/AbstView_199_193762.html Background: Unlike approved IV administered therapies, Medicare is under no obligation to cover prescription medicines. We sought to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the two FDA-75approved orally administered PARP inhibitors (PARPi), olaparib and rucaparib. Methods: A Markov model was created in TreeAge Pro 2015 with nodes in the chain allowing patients to transition through response, hematological complications, non-hematological complications, progression, and death. Separately, the PARP inhibitors were compared with IV administered drugs approved for recurrent ovarian cancers including platinum-based, non-platinum, and bevacizumab-based regimens. Toxicity and mean PFS rates for the different agents were obtained from registration trial data. Costs of IV chemotherapy, managing toxicities, infusions, and supportive care were estimated using 2015 Medicare data. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) were calculated and survival was reported in quality adjusted life months. Results: Platinum-based combinations were the most cost-effective at $1,672/PFS mo for olaparib and $137,068 for rucaparib prior to progression, costs associated with PARPi were 7.1 to 8.3X more than platinum combinations. To better compare the registration trial data to PARPi data, probability was adjusted to 2nd line for rucaparib, revealing it's ICERs' of per month of life added to be $26,997 for bevacizumab, $17,757 for non-platinum, and $79,585 platinums. Conclusions: The high costs of PARPi were not balanced by costs of infusion and managing toxicities of IV drugs typically associated with lower response rates and shorter PFS in the recurrent space. Balancing incremental clinical benefit with novel therapies remains problematic and could widen disparities among those with limited access to care. Jiaru Bai (presenter and session chair), Cristina Del Campo and L. Robin Keller, \"Challenges In Markov Modeling of Cancer Treatment,\" invited talk in cluster on Computational Decision Analysis under cluster chair Jay Simon, INFORMS Computing Society ICS2017 conference, January 2017, Austin, Texas. Jay Simon (presenter), L. Robin Keller, \"Spatial preference functions for risk analysis,\" invited talk in Spatial Multicriteria Analysis session, INFORMS Annual Meeting, Nashville, Nov. 2016. When outcomes are defined over a geographic region, measures of spatial risk regarding these outcomes can be more complex than traditional measures of risk. One of the main challenges is the need for a cardinal preference function that incorporates the spatial nature of the outcomes. We explore preference conditions that will yield the existence of spatial measurable value and utility functions, and discuss their application to spatial risk analysis. L.

Robin Keller, \"Challenges in Markov modeling of cancer treatment,\" invited talk in Models in Medical Decision Making session, INFORMS Annual Meeting, Nashville, Nov. 2016. We present a way to build a Markov decision tree to model cancer progression and cost- effectiveness analysis for two or more cancer treatments. We propose several problems researchers can encounter in this kind of research and provide possible solutions. Ali Esmaeeli (presenter), L. Robin Keller, \"Geographically weighted multi-attribute decision making for taxi assignment,\" invited talk in Spatial Multicriteria Analysis session, INFORMS Annual Meeting, Nashville, Nov. 2016. The taxi assignment problem is usually considered as one part of the more general vehicle routing problem (VRP) with a known value function. In this work, we extend this viewpoint to match the problem more with the real world conditions. We consider a map with weighted regions and propose a method to find the best option for each taxi request based on two different attributes. These attributes are the average response time for each region and the rate of accepted requests for each region. We show how to combine these attributes and how to include the region weights into the main value function. Moreover, we present a method for finding the best assignment option based on our defined value function.

The term \"performance-based\" is often used to refer to (a) standards that mandate outcomes and give firms flexibility in how to meet them, or (b) requirements for firms to use management systems consisting of internal plans and practices for promoting safety and reducing risk. Performance-based regulation is usually contrasted with \"prescriptive\" regulation - sometimes called specification, design, or technology standards - that requires firms to adopt specific means to promote safety and reduce risks. This study will compare the advantages and disadvantages of prescriptive- and performance-based forms of safety regulation and identify possible opportunities for, and constraints on, making greater use of the latter. The study will be informed by experiences of performance-based safety regulation in the U.S. and abroad and will make recommendations about the application of this regulatory approach in high-hazard industries, such as off-shore oil and gas, pipelines, and other modes of transportation.\" Book in progress (late 2017, expected publication date), Committee for a Study of Performance- Based Safety Regulation, Transportation Research Board, National Research Council of the National Academies Book is authored by the \"Committee\" https://www8.nationalacademies.org/cp/CommitteeView.aspx?key=49767 DETLOF VON WINTERFELDT, University of Southern California, chair; KENNETH ARNOLD, WorleyParsons; CARY COGLIANESE, University of Pennsylvania; LOUIS ANTHONY (Tony) COX, Cox Associates, LLC; ROBIN L.
