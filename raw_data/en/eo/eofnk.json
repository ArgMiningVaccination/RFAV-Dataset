They are very different and often at odds. How can you tell if an autism organization is by and for autistic people and autistic community? Signs of a Bad Autism Organization - They use cure and tragedy language. - They use pathology paradigm language. - They use person first language instead of identity first language. - They endorse ABA, PBS/PBIS, and behaviorism. - They court and amplify Autism Warrior Parents. - They don't have autistic people in leadership roles. - They use puzzle piece and \"light it up blue\" imagery. - They use inspiration exploitation / inspiration porn tropes. - They center the perspective of parents instead of autistic people. - Two main telltales: They try to cure us (eugenics) and impose non-autistic-oriented goals on us (behaviorism). Autism charities, on the other hand, are more geared towards families of autistic people, such as parents and relatives of autistic people. They are centered on the medical model of disability, and often include the notion of curing, treating, preventing, or combating autism in their mission statement, or otherwise looking for \"answers\" to solve the \"puzzle\" of autism. They characterize autism as a tragedy or something undesirable, and may compare it to diseases and disorders. They may use outdated or falsified research to support their statements of autism being a tragedy or being caused by environmental factors or vaccines. They often have minimal, if any involvement of autistic people in their organization. They may pathologize autism or compare autism to a disease by using language to describe autistic people such as \"people touched by autism,\" \"people impacted by autism,\" or, \"people affected by autism.\" They may use symbols that depict autistic people as broken, missing links or infantilize autistic people, such as the puzzle piece symbol. A majority of the budget for most autism charities goes towards cure and treatment research, administration, and conferences that support the medical model of disability, advertisements that spread autism \"awareness\" through pathologizing autism and fear mongering such as the [\"I am Autism\"]advertisement from Autism Speaks. [Good Autistic Advocacy Organizations vs. Bad Autism \"Charities\"] Signs of a Good Autism Organization - They use identity first language. - They use neurodiverty paradigm and social model language. - They reject ABA, PBS/PBIS, and behaviorism. - They reject cure language and eugenics. - They have autistic people in leadership roles. - They use rainbow infinity imagery. - They center autistic people ourselves and speak in the first person. - They endorse a biopsychosocial model. [Good Autistic Advocacy Organizations vs. Bad Autism \"Charities\"] - Supports, not cures: autism is a naturally occurring human neurological variation and not a disease process to be cured. Autistic neurology, sensory traits, processing, communication, and other autism-specific traits should be accommodated, not stigmatized. Qualify of life for autistic people of all ages and abilities should be a primary focus. Medical or health issues that may accompany autism should be addressed as co-occurring conditions, not as integral to autism. - Autistic-informed supports and therapies: Services for autistic individuals must improve their quality of life. When there is conflict between non-autistic autism professionals and the autistic community as to an approach or therapy, the organization takes autistic concerns seriously, and looks to participatory and otherwise autistic-informed research, and self-advocate leadership, for direction. - Inclusiveness: Autistic people must have significant, meaningful, and primary roles in all aspects of the organization, especially at board and executive levels, with regards to planning and decision-making. Autistic employees and contractors will be compensated at the same level as other participants doing similar work. - Acceptance, not stigmatization: All aspects of the organization's financial cycle, from advertising and fundraising through grants and programs, must be driven by values of inclusion and acceptance of autistic people of all ages and abilities. It is not acceptable to use scare tactics or negative imagery to promote autism awareness. - Advocacy for the human and civil rights of all autistic people: Clear positions must be publicly expressed on issues that affect the well being of autistic individuals. Such issues include the use of physical and chemical restraints; the lack of full inclusion in education, work, and housing; and funding for programs that address the immediate needs of autistic people in their communities. [How do you know if an autism organization is good?] Nothing About Us Without Us The autism community speaks over us in the autistic community and sucks up all the funding. Organizations that are not autistic and disabled led violate a core tenet: Nothing about us with us. I first heard the expression \"Nothing About Us Without Us\" in South Africa in 1993. Michael Masutha and William Rowland, two leaders ofDisabled People South Africa, separately invoked the slo- gan, which they had heard used by someone from Eastern Europe at an international disability rights conference. The slogan's power derives from its location of the source of many types of (disability) oppression and its simultaneous opposition to such oppression in the context of control and voice. \"Nothing About Us Without Us\" resonates with the philosophy and history of the disability rights movement (DRM), a movement that has embarked on a belated mission parallel to other liberation movements. As Ed Roberts, one of the leading figures of the international DRM, has said, \"If we have learned one thing from the civil rights movement in the U.S., it's that when others speak for you, you lose\" (Driedger 1989:28). In this sense, \"Our Bodies, Ourselves\" and \"Power to the People\" can be recognized as precedents for \"Nothing About Us With- out Us.\" The DRM's demand for control is the essential theme that runs through all its work, regardless of political-economic or cultural differences. Control has universal appeal for DRM activists because the needs of people with disabilities and the potential for meeting these needs are everywhere conditioned by a dependency born of powerless- ness, poverty, degradation, and institutionalization. This dependency, saturated with paternalism, begins with the onset of disability and con- tinues until death. The condition of dependency is presently typical for hundreds of millions of people throughout the world.
