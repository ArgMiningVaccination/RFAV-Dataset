MindBody Therapy is the discovery of the self, the essence of what's created the self. It supports us to understand and shift what gets in the way of being free, happy, and fully alive. While traditional therapy focuses on verbal processing and cognitive meaning making, MindBody therapy invites the individual into the wisdom of their body as the intuitive place of healing and well-being. MindBody Therapy offers a paradigm shift, situating the individual as the expert of their own journey of healing, transformation, and wellbeing.

The summit speakers have given me so much joy and hope.\" \u2014 2020 SUMMIT REGISTRANT OUR MISSION The MindBody Therapy Summit is dedicated to shifting the paradigm around how we know and experience ourselves and others, and how we understand the nature of relationship. Through methodologies such as Somatic Experiencing\u00ae, Hakomi, Body-Mind Centering\u00ae, Gestalt, Sensorimotor Psychotherapy, Integral Somatic Psychology, Social Transformation, and many other body oriented approaches to wellness, we hope to contribute to a fuller, more nuanced picture of consciousness as necessarily embodied and relational. This conversation and exploration doesn't end with the summit. Our hope is that the summit is itself an invitation for all of us to challenge how we've conceptualized and divided mind/body/spirit, and how we might begin to reimagine ourselves, others and the world we live in. The MindBody Therapy Summit is a unique opportunity to hear from some of the most impactful voices at the intersection of psychology, embodiment and somatics. SUMMIT SCHEDULE This training offers 5 full days of on-demand online sessions. This summit may be taken online via our On-Demand Content Library. You will receive clear instructions on how to access your classes. WHAT IS EMBODIMENT AND SOMATICS? The first way we experience the world is through sensing our whole body. It's the most primal form of inner communication that directs all thought, feeling, and action. Soma means \"the living body\" and somatics refers to practices of being in dialogue with the living body. We explore these practices as a means to embody. To embody, means to manifest - to make visible, tangible, and real. Embodiment is a process of realizing each aspect of our self- feeling and experiencing its connection to the whole. As the unapologetic expression of that full self, embodiment can be understood as the antithesis of oppression. We acknowledge that beneath the umbrella of the term \"embodiment\" are practices belonging to ancient lineages and traditions that have been appropriated by Western models. We are actively working to illuminate the origins of these practices as part of our commitment. Through this summit we hope to make embodiment, somatics, and fundamental learnings in these domains accessible to a broad, global audience\u2014 making it easier to access supports for everyone in their embodiment journey. Are you ready to actualise your full potential using movement, sensation and breath to discover your truest self? You are welcome here. As we dive into the depths of who and how you are during this 5-day summit, it is instrumental to know that you belong; that there are adventures waiting for you on your path to a more fulfilled existence; that you have a like-minded and nurturing community who will support your experience; that you are exactly where you're meant to be. Our objective is to create a safe and supportive collective space for the embodiment community to learn from one another, deepen their learning together, and easily find pathways of learning and certification to meet their personal and professional goals. \"This summit has changed my life.\" \u2014 2020 SUMMIT REGISTRANT PRICING These deep-dive training experiences are offered with an exclusive discount for all Embodied Yoga Members.
