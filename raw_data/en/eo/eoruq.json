Data sources: PubMed, CINAHL, AMED, PsychInfo, Web of Science and EMBASE were searched frominception through 2010. In addition, bibliographies offound articles and reviews were searched, and keyresearchers were contacted. Eligibility criteria for selecting studies: Studies of CIM were identified using criteria based on those ofthe Cochrane complementary and alternative medicinegroup. All studies of CIM reporting economicoutcomes were included. Study appraisal methods: All recent (and likely most cost-relevant) full economic evaluationspublished 2001 -2010 were subjected to several measures of quality. Detailed results of higher-qualitystudies are reported. Results: A total of 338 economic evaluations of CIM were identified, of which 204, covering a wide varietyof CIM for different populations, were published2001 -2010. A total of 114 of these were full economic evaluations. And 90% of these articles covered studiesof single CIM therapies and only one compared usualcare to usual care plus access to multiple licensed CIMpractitioners. Of the recent full evaluations, 31 (27%)met five study-quality criteria, and 22 of these also metthe minimum criterion for study transferability('generalisability '). Of the 56 comparisons made in the higher-quality studies, 16 (29%) show a healthimprovement with cost savings for the CIM therapyversus usual care. Study quality of the cost-utilityanalyses (CUAs) of CIM was generally comparableto that seen in CUAs across all medicine according toseveral measures, and the quality of the cost-savingstudies was slightly, but not significantly, lowerthan those showing cost increases (85% vs 88%,p=0.460). Conclusions: This comprehensive review identified many CIM economic evaluations missed by previousreviews and emerging evidence of cost-effectivenessand possible cost savings in at least a few clinicalpopulations. Recommendations are made for futurestudies. INTRODUCTION Between 1990 and 2007, four nationally representative surveys demonstrated that a third or more of US adults routinely usedARTICLE SUMMARY Article focus Given the limited nature of previous systematic reviews, what is the extent of evidence on theeconomic impacts of complementary and inte-grative medicine (CIM)? What are the range of therapies and populationsstudied, and the quality of published economicevaluations of CIM? What are the results of the higher-quality, morerecent (and likely most cost-relevant) economicevaluations of CIM? Key messages This study' s comprehensive search strategy iden- tified 338 economic evaluations of CIM, includ-ing 114 full evaluations published 2001 -2010. The cost-utility analyses found were of similar orbetter quality to those published across all medicine. The higher-quality studies indicate potential cost-effectiveness, and even cost savings across anumber of CIM therapies and populations. Strengths and limitations of this study The strengths of this study are the comprehen- sive search strategy, the use of two reviewers,the use of multiple measures of study qualityand the identification of higher-quality studies, for which results are reported in detail, via an objective short-list of quality criteria, whichreduced the potential for bias. The weaknesses of this study are similar to those of the other systematic reviews: reviewerswere not blinded to journals and article authors,and some aspects of what makes a quality eco-nomic evaluation could not be judged from whatwas reported. Publication bias was not assessed. However, it isnot clear as to whether publication bias is rele-vant, given the purposes of this review.

Downloaded from complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) therap- ies to treat their principal medical conditions.1-4Total expenditures for CAM therapies were estimated at US$14 billion in 1990, 1US$27 billion in 19972and US$34 billion in 2007.4The 2007 US National Health Inventory Survey found that out-of-pocket expenditures for CAMtherapies accounted for 11% of all out-of-pocket health-care expenditures by Americans. 4Similar use numbers are seen in other countries.5-8However, despite the popularity of and substantial expenditures on CAM ther-apies, their cost-effectiveness remains ill-de ned and controversial. Economic evaluations allow costs to be included, alongside data on safety and effectiveness, in healthcare policy decisions. As healthcare costs rise, the availability of these economic evaluations becomes increasinglyimportant to the formulation of disease management strategies which are both clinically effective and nan- cially responsible. According to the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM), CAM is 'a group of diverse medical and healthcare systems, practices and products that are not generally considered part of conventional medicine '. 9In not being part of conventional medicine, individual comple-mentary therapies and emerging models of integrativemedicine (ie, coordinated access to both conventional and complementary care) \u2014collectively termed as com- plementary and integrative medicine (CIM) \u2014are often excluded in nancial mechanisms commonly available for conventional medicine, 2and are rarely included in the range of options considered in the formation of healthcare policy. The availability of economic data could improve the consideration and appropriate inclu- sion of CIM in strategies to lower overall healthcarecosts. In addition, economic outcomes are relevant to the licensure and scope of practice of practitioners, industry investment decisions (eg, the business case forintegrative medicine), consumers and future research efforts (ie, through identifying decision-critical para- meters for additional research 10). A number of systematic reviews of economic evalua- tions of CIM have been published.11-23Five of these prior reviews attempted to capture all economic evalua-tions of CIM therapies across all conditions. 11 19- 21 23 However, it is unclear as to whether all or even themajority of economic evaluations of CIM have beenidenti ed by these reviews. The searches are dated; the search strategy in the most recent review only capturedarticles published through 2007. 23The databases searched were limited \u2014for example, only one used CINAHL,21and only two others used EMBASE,19 23in addition to Medline and AMED. Finally, these reviewsgenerally used limited search terms to identify CIM studies. All but one only used variations on the terms 'complementary 'or'alternative ''medicine 'or'therapy '. Unfortunately, other reviewers have found that these search terms do not capture all CIM studies, 24 25which may be a re flection of the dif culty in de ning what isand is not CIM.26The search by Maxion-Bergemann et al11also added individual therapies as search terms, but only included homeopathy, phytotherapy, traditional Chinese medicine, anthroposophic medicine and neuraltherapy. No search included 'integrative medicine '. The goal of this paper is to identify, to the extent pos- sible, all published economic evaluations of CIM,describe the types of CIM evaluated and the clinical con- ditions for which they have been evaluated, and identify the recent (and therefore, most cost-relevant) higher-quality studies and highlight their results for policy makers. We also make recommendations for future eco- nomic evaluations of CIM. METHODS Six electronic databases were searched from their incep-tion through December 2010: PubMed, CINAHL, AMED, PsychInfo, Web of Science and EMBASE. To be as comprehensive as possible, a combination of 11medical subject headings (MeSH) and 39 other search terms were used (box 1). In addition, bibliographies of found articles and reviews were searched, and keyresearchers in various areas of CIM were contacted for their lists of known studies. Although non-English lan- guage articles were collected, they are not analysed inthis review. Dening a comprehensive search strategy for CIM is challenging. 24 27- 29There have been a number of efforts to develop a concise de nition of CAM.26 30This review used the one developed by the members of theCochrane CAM Field 31and then added with the NCCAM de n- ition9and then re nes it by speci cally including all Box 1 Search terms used for the PubMed search: (Complementary Therapies (medical subject headings (MeSH)), Dietary Supplements(MeSH), Micronutrients (MeSH), Trace Elements (MeSH), alternative medicine, ayurvedic medicine,chiropractic, biofeedback, collaborative medicine, complementaryand alternative medicine, botanical medicine, complementary medi-cine, diet, energy medicine, herbal medicine, herbs, homeopathy,hypnosis, integrated medicine, integrative medicine, massage,meditation, mind-body medicine, minerals, naturopathic medicine,naturopathy, nutrients, nutritional supplements, relaxation, spatherapy, traditional Chinese medicine OR vitamins) AND (Cost-Benefit Analysis (MeSH), Cost Control (MeSH), Cost Savings(MeSH), Costs and Cost Analysis (MeSH), Economics (MeSH), eco-nomics (Subheading), Insurance (MeSH), cost benefit, cost effect-iveness, cost identification, cost minimisation, cost utility, economicevaluation, insurance claims, managed care OR technology assess-ment). Searches in the other five databases used the same textwords and (where available) analogous controlled vocabulary terms.All searches were restricted to human studies. 2 Herman PM, Poindexter BL, Witt CM, et al.BMJ Open 2012; 2:e001046. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2012-001046Economics of complementary and integrative medicine on September 17, 2023 by guest.

Downloaded from therapies 'based upon the theories of a medical system outside the Western allopathic medical model '(eg, trad- itional Chinese medicine and Reiki), and including others depending on the context and setting of theiruse. The context of use considers treatment/condition combinations and excludes those 'currently considered to be standard treatment ', and the setting of use gener- ally includes self-care and therapies delivered by CIMproviders, but excludes therapies 'delivered exclusively by conventionally credenti aled medical personnel or exclusively within hospital settings '. Therefore, therap- ies such as chemotherapy regimens (eg, chronother- apy 32), and therapies requiring surgical implantation (eg, neurore flexotherapy33) or the placement of a feeding tube34were not included even though these therapies appeared in our search. In cases where CIMtherapies (eg, biofeedback or hypnosis) were included as part of a package of care (eg, with cognitive behav- ioural therapy), a judgement was made as to whetherthe CIM portion of the treatment made up half or more of the overall package of care under study. If so, the package of care was included as CIM. Becausemore than half of CIM users use multiple CIM therap- ies, 35studies of packages of therapies and coordinated care were identi ed as such. Articles were categorised as full economic evaluations if they compared the costs (inputs) and consequences (economic, clinical and/or humanistic outcomes36)o f two or more therapeutic alternatives applied to the same patient population (ref.37, p. 11). Otherwise, they were considered partial evaluations, for example, cost- identi cation or cost-comparison studies.38Studies that estimated resource utilisation were included as eco-nomic evaluations if the utilisation data were detailedenough to allow monetary valuation. Two reviewers (PMH and BLP) evaluated all articles for inclusion and extracted all data. Disagreements wereresolved by discussion between the two review authors, or, if needed, by the other coauthors. Because the results of economic evaluations can rapidly lose rele-vance with time, mainly due to changes in practice pat- terns and cost structures, data were extracted only from the economic evaluations published 2001- 2010. Extracted data were entered into an Excel template developed for a previous review. 20The type(s) of CIM evaluated and the target population were captured for all economic evaluations. Various indicators of study quality were captured for all full economic evaluations, and more detailed data and results were captured onlyfor those full economic evaluations that met ve quality criteria. The quality of an economic evaluation can be judged along two general dimensions: (1) whether the study was a quality measure of outcomes for its target population and location \u2014that is, whether it was internally valid; and (2) whether enough information is provided for the study 's results to be transferable ( 'generalisable '). 39 Health outcomes are to some extent consideredgeneralisable across settings; however, because resource availability, practice patterns and relative prices can vary greatly, economic outcomes usually are not.40Therefore, one goal in economic evaluation is to ensure the transfer- ability of study results \u2014that is, to provide enough study detail so that results can be adapted (usually via model- ling) to apply to other settings.39The 35-item BMJ check- list captures components of both dimensions of quality and was applied to all full economic evaluations.41We also chose ve quality criteria by which to identify a subset of full economic evaluations to highlight as beingof most interest to policy makers. These quality criteria are based on recommendations made by the US Panel onCost Effectiveness in Health and Medicine 42and by well- known experts in the eld,37and focus on the quality of the underlying study (the rst type of quality): Because cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) is compara- tive, to ensure that results are useful to decision makers, one of the alternatives to which the CIMintervention was compared must be some version of commonly available (routine, standard or usual) care. The analysis must explicitly or implicitly use (and include all relevant costs from) at least one recog- nised perspective \u2014for example, society, third-party payer, hospital or employer. Since 'an economic evaluation of a healthcare pro- gramme is only as good as the effectiveness data it is built upon '(ref. 43, p. 232), health outcomes must be from randomised controlled trials or non-randomised controlled trials using either statistical adjustment or matching to address baseline differences. Since having patient-speci c data on both costs and outcomes is an advantage for internal validity,44 resource use must be a measured outcome of thestudy. Modelling studies utilise the results of other published studies, therefore, are exempt from this criterion. Because uncertainty in an economic evaluation comes not just from sample variation, but also from assumptions made, 45a sensitivity analysis is required. Because the prices used to value resources are highly location-speci c and setting-speci c,39 46we also note, for the articles meeting the above criteria, the presenceof a study reporting criterion essential for the transfer- ability of study results (usually via modelling): 39 40separ- ate reporting of unit costs from resource use for economic evaluations alongside trials, or from model parameters (eg, transition probabilities) for economic evaluations using models. Other data extracted for the economic evaluations which meet the ve study-quality criteria are: treatment and study duration, primary clinical and economicoutcome measures, the setting in which treatment took place, study design and sample size, the type (table 1 ) and perspective (ie, the point of view used to de ne costs) of the economic analysis, and incremental cost-effectiveness of the CIM alternative compared to usual care. Incremental cost-effectiveness is reported in Herman PM, Poindexter BL, Witt CM, et al.BMJ Open 2012; 2:e001046. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2012-001046 3Economics of complementary and integrative medicine on September 17, 2023 by guest.

Downloaded from supplied list search for a total of 338 economic evalua- tions of CIM. Of these, 204 (60%) were published from 2001 through 2010 (114 full and 90 partial economic evaluations). Of the recent full economic evaluationsalmost all (103, 90%) examined the effect of one CIM therapy and most of the balance (10, 9%) examined the effect of two or more CIM therapies provided by thesame practitioner. Only one looked at the effect of mul- tiple CIM therapies provided by different CIM provi- ders. 52CIM was generally evaluated as an adjunct to usual care. As shown in table 2 , the 204 economic evaluations pub- lished in the past 10 years are spread across a wide rangeof CIM therapies applied to a number of different study populations. The biggest concentration of full economic evaluations (19 in number) pertained to the use manipulation, massage,etc) for the treatment of back pain. 53-72However, even this subgroup is fairly heterogeneous in terms of thetherapy (or therapies) tested and/or the type of back paintreated. Eight of these comparisons involved chiropractic care for back pain; one for chronic, 53one for acute57and six for either type.59 60 63 64 67 68Five evaluated spinal manipulation and manual therapy provided by phy-siotherapists for chronic back pain (one), 65acute back sub- acute pain72and two for musculoskeletal conditions including back pain.66 68Three evaluated massage; two for chronic55 62and one for acute back pain.57The last two studies evaluated a musculoskeletal physician (treatment 'with a combination of manual therapy, injections, acu- puncture and other pain management techniques ')f o r orthopaedic referrals;54and a Finnish folk medicine prac- tice called 'bone setting 'for the treatment of patients with chronic back pain.61 Table 3 shows the results of the application of the 35-item BMJ checklist to the full economic evaluations published 2001 -2010.41On average, the number of Table 2 Types of individual complementary and integrative medicine (CIM) therapies studied for various conditions and in various populations: 2001 -2010 (reported as the ratio of the total number of economic evaluations to the number of full economic evaluations) Manipulative andbody-basedpractices AcupunctureNaturalproductsOthermind-bodymedicine HomeopathyCIM ingeneralOther CIMtherapies* Totals Back pain 28 : 19 11 : 10 2 : 2 - 1:1 3:0 2:2 4 2:2 9 Rheumaticdisorders9:5 6:4 6:6 2:2 - 1 : 0 4 : 3 27 : 19 Mixed populations 4 : 1 6 : 1 2 : 1 3 : 1 9 : 5 2 : 1 3 : 2 24 : 9Cardiovascular disease and diabetes- 1:0 8:6 6:4 1:1 - 8:1 2 Infection (various) -- 6:4 - 7:4 -- 13 : 8 Surgery 1 : 1 2 : 2 4 : 3 5 : 4 -- - 12 : 10 Members of insurance plans3:0 2:0 -- 1:0 7:0 - 12 -- 3:1 1 1:4 Headaches 1 : 0 3 : 3 - 4:3 1:1 -- 9:7 Children (variousconditions)1:0 -- - 6:4 1:0 1:0 9:4 Cancer 2 : 1 2 : 1 1 : 1 2 : 2 - 2:0 - 8:4 Pregnancy andwomen 's health- 5:5 1 9:1 1 Totals 45 : 25 41 : 29 38 : 28 27 : 16 24 : 13 18 : 1 25 : 12 204 : 114 *Other CIM therapies included aromatherapy, healing touch, Tai Chi, Alexander technique, spa therapy, music therapy, electrodermal screening, clinical holistic medicine, naturopathic medicine, anthroposophic medicine, water-only fasting, Ornish Program for Reversing Heart Disease, use of a corset and use of a traditional mental health practitioner.Totals across (down) columns will not add to numbers in the totals column (row) due to individual studies addressing more than one CIM therapy (patients in more than one group).

Downloaded from applicable items met by each article stayed fairly con- stant during this period. However, the application of two key items (ie, the proper use of discounting and the inclusion of sensitivity analysis) and the disclosure offunding sources improved signi cantly, and reporting of the study time horizon worsened signi cantly. As expected, the average overall and individual-item per-centages were higher for the higher-quality articles (those meeting the ve study-quality criteria) and for CUAs of CIM. It is not surprising that CUA 's quality is higher. They generally involve more effort than otherCEAs and are required or recommended by various national guidelines. 42 73- 75Nevertheless, it seems as though the quality of CUAs of CIM is generally compar- able to, or slightly better than, that seen in CUAs across all medicine, at least in terms of the Tufts quality score,disclosure of funding sources and the ve items where comparable data are available. 76 77 The number of full evaluations meeting each of the ve study-quality criteria are: comparison to usual care 97 (85%), all costs from a recognised perspective96 (84%), health outcomes from a randomised or matched-control trial 86 (75%), patient-speci c data on costs and outcomes 105 (92%) and sensitivity analyses 37 (32%).Sixty-two (54%) of full evaluations met the rst four of these and 31 (27%) met all ve.

DISCUSSION This comprehensive systematic review identi ed 338 eco- nomic evaluations of CIM; 204 of which were publishedrecently (2001- 2010) covering a wide range of CIM ther- apies for a variety of populations. Although most patients who use CIM use more than one modality 35and despite the attention given to integrative medicine (coordinatedaccess to conventional medicine and CIM),105this system- atic review found only one study that examined theeffects of use of multiple CIM practitioners. 52In general, the quality of the recent full economic evaluations has held constant and is in line with what is seen in economic evaluations in conventional medicine. Details of the 31 recent higher-quality full economic evaluations indicatepotential cost-effectiveness and cost savings across a variety of CIM therapies applied to different conditions. Owing to the non-generalisable nature of economic eva-luations, the cost estimates shown are speci c to their study settings. 40However, 22 articles provided at least the minimum information for study transferability.Therefore, their results could be adapted via modelling to determine the economic impact of these interventions in other settings. The strengths of this study are the comprehensive search strategy, which revealed a substantial number ofpublished economic evaluations of CIM, the use of tworeviewers and the use of multiple measures of study quality. Higher-quality studies were identi ed and high- lighted for policy makers using a simple objective list of quality criteria, which reduced the potential for bias. The weaknesses of this study are similar to those of the other systematic reviews. The reviewers were not blindedto journals and article authors, which may have in flu- enced results. Also, some aspects of what makes a qualityeconomic evaluation could not be judged from what wasreported. For example, ideally, pragmatic trials enrol patients typical of normal caseload in typical settings with typically trained and experienced practitioners fol-lowing them under routine conditions (ref. 37, p. 251). Judgements as to whether these criteria were met werenot always possible from the reports, and were beyondthe scope of this review. Finally, publication bias was not assessed. However, since the major goal of this study was to establish the extent of the published literature on thistopic and to highlight the results of the higher-quality studies, it is not clear that publication bias is relevant here. The number of economic evaluations of CIM found and reviewed by this study far exceeds the numbersfound in previous studies. 11 19- 21 23This study found a total of 338 economic evaluations of CIM published between and including 1979 and 2010; 211 of these were full economic evaluations. White and Ernst19identi ed 34 economic evaluations of CAM published 1987- 1999; 11 of which were full economic evaluations. Between1999 and October 2004, Herman et al 20identi ed 56 eco- nomic evaluations of CAM (39 full evaluations). Between 1994 and May 2004 Hulme and Long21identi ed 19 full economic evaluations of CAM, and over a similar period (1995 -2007) Doran et al23found 43 economic evalua- tions (15 full evaluations). Maxion-Bergemann et al11 identi ed 5 (1 full) economic evaluations over an unspeci ed search period. The large number of eco- nomic evaluations found in this study re flects the facts that: (1) all evaluations from previous reviews were 12 Herman PM, Poindexter BL, Witt CM, et al.BMJ Open 2012; 2:e001046. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2012-001046Economics of complementary and integrative medicine on September 17, 2023 by guest.

Downloaded from included; (2) a number of studies have been published since the last search dates of prior reviews and (3) a more extensive search strategy was used. It should be noted that 20% of the articles (68 of 338) in this review wereidenti ed through bibliography searches and from expert lists. Therefore, even the application of a long listof search terms to multiple databases does not guaranteethat all CIM studies will be identi ed. However, there is some evidence that the indexing of these articles inmedical databases is improving; studies from bibliograph-ies and expert lists made up 32% of found articles pub- lished 2000 and before, but only 12% recent articles. There are several implications of this study for policy makers, clinicians and future researchers. First, there isa large and growing literature of quality economic eva- luations in CIM. However, although indexing is improv-ing in databases, nding these studies can require going beyond simple CIM-related search terms. Second, theresults of the higher-quality studies indicate a number ofhighly cost-effective, and even cost saving, CIM therap- ies. Almost 30% of the 56 cost-effectiveness, cost-utility and cost-bene t comparisons shown in table 4 (18% of the CUA comparisons) were cost saving. Compare this to 9% of 1433 CUA comparisons found to be cost saving in a large review of economic evaluations across allmedicine. 106Third, by meeting the ve study-quality cri- teria, the studies shown in table 4 can each be consid- ered a reasonable indicator of the health and economicimpacts of the CIM therapy studied, at least in that popu- lation and setting. These studies, especially those showing cost savings, should be considered further for applicabil-ity in other settings. This requires the study to be transfer- able. 39Fortunately, the majority of the higher-quality studies met our measure of study transferability \u2014 resource use or model parameters, and unit costs werereported separately. Given the substantial number of economic evaluations of CIM found in this comprehensive review, eventhough it can always be said that more studies are needed, what is actually needed are better-quality studies \u2014both in terms of better study quality (to increase the validity of the results for its targeted population and setting) and better transferability (to increase the usefulness ofthese results to other decision makers in other settings). Therefore, the following recommendations are made. 1. That all studies measuring the effectiveness of CIM at least consider also measuring input costs and eco- nomic outcomes. 2. That at least one arm of the study be some version of commonly available (usual) care, and that usual careand all interventions studied be described in suf - cient detail that decision makers in other settings can determine what was done and whether the study 's usual care comparator is applicable in their setting. 3. That consideration be given to how CIM is typically used (eg, multiple CIM therapies) or can be used (eg, coordinated integrative care models) when designing studies.4. That changes in resource use be reported separately from unit costs in economic evaluations alongside clinical trials and that model parameters and unit costs be clearly reported in decision-analytic model-ling studies. 5. That all economic evaluations contain sensitivity ana- lyses to increase the reliability of results. 6. That more consideration be given to modelling as a method to estimate economic outcomes for existingeffectiveness trial results, and to generalise existingquality economic evaluation results to other jurisdictions.
