The result is flavorful meals that are healthy, energy boosting, and satisfying. At BMC, we encourage using this method as a way to eat more healthy food and fewer unhealthy foods without sacrificing tradition and taste. Focus on fiber, keep your plate colorful, and drink water. Why is the plate method important? The plate method helps patients portion out starchy, carbohydrate-containing foods that have the most impact on blood glucose levels. It also helps us to remember to eat a variety of food groups, like fruits, non-starchy vegetables, whole grains, proteins, dairy, and healthy fats. What do carbohydrates have to do with blood glucose? Carbohydrates (i.e. bread, grains, starchy vegetables, fruit/fruit juices, milk, yogurt, sweets/desserts) are digested into glucose, which causes blood sugar to increase. It's important to keep blood glucose in a healthy range in order to stay healthy and feel energized. \"Carb counting\" can be helpful in managing blood glucose levels. It is not a diet, but rather a flexible meal planning tool. It's important to make healthy carb choices that contain fiber, and choose foods like beans, whole grains, and whole fruits. "}
