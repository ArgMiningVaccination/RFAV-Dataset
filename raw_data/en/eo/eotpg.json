NCI hid results of tests with Professor who claims he discoverd the bark. When data was released stating the faulty statistics; this innacurate information was re-circulated by all chemists and bio-engineers and scientists. hence, trying to immobilze traditional medicine.

Building Integrative accredited Hospital with accredited practitioners. http://www.aadnc- aandc.gc.ca/eng/1100100031766/1100100031768 Examples of Research Objectives and Accredition Obstacles: * This outlines the framework structure of Allopathic Medicine Objectives which regulatory institutions use when researching Indigenous Medicines. When Traditional Medicines are not bio-engineered through chemical extraction; they will always fall in the category of subjective, unproven science. This perpetuates research, advances bio-pirating and continues exploitation of Indigneous resources and knowledge. This information has been pirated and stored. Information has not been openly shared back with us via Ethnologists . This module is displays why we need to move to Self-Regulation of our Own Medines and include that in our Self-Governance Plans. FUNDING It is important to be Self-Funded without sponsorship from Research Institutes who have different on objectives and goals. This is always a dead end for First Nations. We must generate research money from public interest and donations ourselves. We cannot be nieve thinking we are safeguarding knowledge. It is already out there and we are disconnected from our ancient ways. Chiefs must voice and endorse a movement and support the Elders in working to restore our Traditional Medicine Way. We must honor traditons while being progressive. We must enable Elders to understand policy, history and relationship with research organizations. * Tell Story of Shamans pharmaceut ical. * Tell Story of UK woman who won award/doctorate by writing about Covert Ethnobotany as a Social Problem. * Tell story of Doctor in Kelowna recommending Natural Alternatives when orthodox medicine was not working and he recently got fired. POLICY: Indigneous First Nations Traditional Medicine Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Indigneous Peoples, Health Rights: We have the right to access health care but not does not list the right to practice our traditional medicines as trade. http://www.ohchr.org/EN/UDHR/Pages/Introduction.aspx Convention of Biological Diversity: Objectives are Conservation, Sustainability and Benefit Sharing by Developing the Nagoya Protocol. http://www.cbd.int/ Nagoya Protocol: Accepted in Canada 2010. Discussions on bio-diversity and bio-pirating. Addressing the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from the use of genetic resources found in plants, animals and microorganisms http://www.cbd.int/abs/about/ BC Transformative Change Accord 2005. 10 yr plan. http://www.gov.bc.ca/arr/social/down/transformative change accord.pdf BC Tri-Partate Framework Agreement Strategy http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/ahc-asc/media/nr-cp/ 2011/2011-133bk-eng.php First Nations Health Authority First Nations Health Council Provincial/Federal Health Canada Ministies ***** All of the above Agreements focus on integrational approaches to First Nations health care which is good! However, the above agreement list the need for accredited practitioners based on Health Canada Allopathic structures only . Idle No More: Land,Water,Bio-diversity Plan to protect future generations. ***** Focused on fair Treaty Rights, Indian Act and First Nations Rights. The focus is on land, water, bio- diversity. CIHR Canadian Institute Health Research: * Tell Story of James Bay Studies and Chief Matthew Coon Come conducted by Montreal University Professor who is also a board member of CIHR. Cancer, Diabetes, Glucoma, Heart Disease Rearch Institutes: do not fund research to market unpatonable natural medicines. ***However, GOOD NEWS! Canadian Diabetes Research Instituate will pay for client to see Traditional Doctor by funding all travel expenses. Resource: 2001 Canadian Dr. O book for World Health Org. http://www.scribd.com/doc/49757159/Traditional-Medicine-for-Canada-s-First-Peoples WHO Traditional Medicine Strategy: World Health Organization: http://www.who.int/medicines/publications/traditionalpolicy/en/index.html ***** WHO is the only one of these organizations who have a solid mandate to enable Traditional Medicine Practices in a fair and equitable way. Good news! CIHR/ Health Canada is signed on with WHO! Currently CIHR is doing a good job with their progressive plan. We are doing a good job working with them! However, CIHR currently does not have an objective to enable practitioners of Traditional Medicine Practice, yet, like some other countries. How do we fit in and integrate? We invest in our own self-regulation, self-fund and work togther! Some Current Positive Initiatives: Self Governance of Health Care Tripartate Framework Agreement. Education of Cultural Beliefs/Traditions Chiefs and Leaders are working Together Bio-Diversity, Conservation, Sustainability Protection of Land/Water Cultural Inclusionism. More Ownership of Decisions ---------------> Some Traditional Medicine Obstacles: There is no Traditional or Modern Plant Medicine Economy. Self-Governance does not include Self-Regulation Healers cannot sustain themselves by working for free within the confines of the law. There is a disconnect of knowledge and practice. Plant Accessibilty is difficult to sustain due to lack of First Nations cultivation and limited Foresty Canada Reforestation Requirements to plant wild medicine plants. Endangered Species and Rare Plants are hard to locate, often small in numbers or bio-regional Most of our Wild Rare Fungus are exported to China and Japan by Mushroom Pickers for Chinese Medicine. Most of our Yew Trees have been cut down by Brysol Myers and the NSI. First Nations do not wish to culturally modify/harvest in wild very much so we can preserve our sacred trees and lands that have been impacted by deforestation. Many of our curative medicine plants are not sold at grocery stores, seed stores or nurseries and hard to find. Opportunities Find opportuniti es for healers to exchange knowledge and time in a fair and equitable way. Work together to maintain basic tradi tions while being progressive. Repair Disconnect of healers with communities. Connect Healers in various Nations together for collective wellness optimization. Support Local Medicine Trades between Nations. Support our own economies by producing our own ingredients/formula's/products. Invest heavily in First Nations ethno-agriculture which did exist in highly populated ancient First Nations communiti es. Educate all First Nations on Traditional Food Medicines on a wider scale and incorporate into education system. Enable access to foods and medicines. Enable easy harvest/ safe plant identification by creating First Nations Medicine and Food Farms. Similar to Wineries or Berry-Picking Farms. Heal our own. Treat whole persons wellness not just disease. Save Money. Balance the Economic Paradigm: *Cana dians makes average 39,000.00/year. Average amount per capita to health is 45OO.oo). *Change those stats in our nations so we are more preventative, self-reliant and focused on integrative First Nations affordable health Care. * Redirect some of those monies back into our own First Nations communites through healing centers, internal research centers, education, agriculture, treatment centers, manufacturing, exporting, philantrophy, etc. Self-Regulation of First Nations Traditional Medicines Examples of other regulated professions: Optometry, Chiropractics, Traditional Chinese Medicine, Naturopathy.. Why we can do it! The legal how to list : 1. Must be able to prove effectiveness through antidotal evidence. 2. Must prove that we have tried through to be included through other systems which will not acknowledge or enable our medicines. 3. Must prove that there is a risk of health risk when we practice 4. Must prove that Alternative Healers Insurance may be necessary. 5. Must have a collective body of wisdom that we are the source of this traditional approach. 6. May draw statistics from other cultures. May include conventional research groups studies, and alternative health care studies, etc. 7. Must prove high ratio of results even if not proven through science. 8. Must prove there is a health risk to people if they do not have access to this modality of practice. 9. Must prove that the wellness of public is the main concern over the objectives of the governing bodies. VALUES "}
