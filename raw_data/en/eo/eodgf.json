The one underlying factor among the elevated risk to infectious diseases and cancers is the inability to mount an effective immune response.\" Dr. Marathi observed, \"While COVID-19 emerging vaccines may provide protection for the general population, our senior citizens with multiple risk factors for COVID-19 have the highest mortality and may have limited vaccine effectiveness. 7 Hills Pharma is developing a novel immune stimulant that can be used to augment the effectiveness and expand the utility of the emerging vaccines for those most at risk.\" 7 Hills Pharma announced earlier this year it was selected to participate in the Blue Knight program based on its development of 7HP349, a first-in-concept oral small molecule immune stimulant designed to improve the effectiveness of immunotherapies such as COVID-19 and influenza vaccines as well an immuno-oncology drugs. Dr. Marathi will make a presentation of his company's technology during the three-day virtual symposium, which will convene a global community of thought leaders, innovators and investors to discuss the COVID-19 pandemic as well as other public health threats. 7 Hills Pharma is one of seven start-ups in JLABS incubators in the U.S., Canada and Europe to be the first beneficiaries of the Blue Knight initiative, which is a collaboration between Johnson & Johnson and the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), a component of the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The companies participating have innovative technologies that address challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. They are receiving funding and mentorship from J&J and BARDA to help advance development of their products. 7 Hills Pharma launched Phase 1 safety trials of 7HP349 in October.
