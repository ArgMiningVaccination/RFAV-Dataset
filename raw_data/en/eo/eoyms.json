A major source of the wind power Spirit will consume will be from the Flat Ridge 3 wind farm, which will be located near Kingman, Kansas, about 50 miles west of our facilities in Wichita. This wind farm is expected to generate about 128 MW of power once the project is complete in early 2021. At that time, Spirit's entire 12 million square foot facility in Wichita will be fully powered by wind. \u00a9 2023 Spirit AeroSystems, Inc. "}
