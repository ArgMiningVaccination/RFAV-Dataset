At some point in our lives, we injure oursevles, whether it be from a physical accident, poor posture or even resting for too long in the wrong position. These injuries can lead the body to create scar tissue and adhesions when repairing itself, which can limit our range of motion and cause pain. Rapid Release Therapy uses a calculated frequency of vibration that is 5x faster than a Theragun to quickly loosen scar tissue, decrease pain and improve range of motion. It can provide short and long term relief in a matter of 3-5 minute and be used as a standalone therapy or in conjunction with other TCM healing methods like acupuncture. People feel immediate relief and find the experience enjoyable and fascinating. Rapid Release Therapy is not a TCM Healing Method. It is a new age technology that uses a vibrational frequency that helps the body to naturally to break up scar tissue, adhesions that limit our range of motion and cause feelings of tension and pain. It warms the tissues, increases circulation to an injured part of the body and facilitates healing. If you are experiencing any type of muscular skeltal pain or tightness, limited range of motion or have post surgical pain long after an incision has healed, you may be a good candidate for Rapid Release Therapy. We avoid using Rapid Release Therapy on those who have clotting disorders or are prone to blood clots, have cancer, have wounds or surgical incisions that are still healing, and those who are pregnant. Acupuncture Acupuncture is one of the oldest and most widely-known methods of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). We use this healing technique to stimulate the body's immune system and strengthen its ability to heal itself. Acupuncture typically involves the insertion of fine, sterile needles at precise locations (or \"points\") which correspond to specific ailments or imbalances in the body. Moxibustion Moxibustion involves burning an herb called Mugwort and applying the resulting heat to specific acupuncture points on the body. Moxibustion is used to gently stimulate acupuncture points or areas of the body in order to quicken the healing process. Cupping Cupping is a therapy that involves placing cups on the skin to create suction. The suction is designed to stimulate the flow of blood within the superficial muscle layers, promoting cell repair. It is commonly used to help relieve muscle tension and soreness as well as the common cold. Tui Na Medicinal Massage Tui Na translates as \"push grasp.\" It is a Chinese medicinal massage technique that aims to soften the muscles, increase circulation, increase range of motion, and decrease pain. It's often used to relieve muscle pain, tension and inflammation, and to heal physical injuries. Gua Sha Gua Sha is a technique used to release muscle tension, tightness, constriction and pain. . A specialized tool is used to gently rub the skin over a problem area. Gua Sha feels like deep tissue massage. Herbal Medicine Chinese Herbal Medicine uses combinations of plants and minerals to help stimulate the body's immune system and strengthen its ability to heal itself. Similar to acupuncture, Herbal Medicine is a powerful healing tool that can be used to address a variety of ailments, from minor imbalances to chronic conditions, with minimal side effects. "}
