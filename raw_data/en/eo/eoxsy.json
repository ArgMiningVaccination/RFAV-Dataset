Use of biologic therapy Biologic therapy for psoriasis should be initiated and supervised only by specialist physicians who are experienced in the diagnosis and treatment of psoriasis. The routine monitoring can be delegated to other healthcare professionals, such as clinical nurse specialists. Other relevant healthcare professionals should be consulted in cases that involve psoriatic arthritis or other multiple comorbidities. Coordination of care providers, along with the patient, is necessary with regard to arrangements for drug administration, monitoring, and followup. Ensure that people with psoriasis who are starting biologic therapy have an opportunity to participate in longterm safety registries. Criteria for use of biologic therapy Criteria for offering biologic therapy are as follows: - Psoriasis requiring systemic therapy - Failure of, intolerance to, or contraindications for methotrexate and cyclosporine - Psoriasis has significant impact on physical, psychological, or social functioning: Extensive (>10% body surface area or Psoriasis Area and Severity Index 10) and/or psoriasis is severe at localized sites and is associated with significant functional impairment Criteria for considering biologic therapy are as follows: - Psoriasis that fulfills disease severity criteria and is accompanied by active psoriatic arthritis - Psoriasis that is persistent (eg, relapses rapidly) when off therapy that cannot be continued long term Choice of biologic therapy Considerations to take into account before initiating or making changes to biologic therapy are as follows: - The presence of both psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, in consultation with a rheumatologist - Presence and phenotype of psoriatic arthritis, which may influence access to and choice and dose of biologic therapy The following psoriasis-related factors should be considered when tailoring the choice of biologic agent to the needs of the patient: - Therapeutic goals - Disease phenotype and activity pattern - Disease severity and impact - Additional presence of psoriatic arthritis - Outcomes of prior psoriasis treatments Other individual factors to consider when tailoring the choice of biologic agent to the needs of the patient are as follows: - Patient age - Current or past comorbidities - Pregnancy status and/or conception plans - Patient body weight - Patient opinion on drug administration route or dosing frequency - Likelihood of compliance with treatment - Drug cost: dministration expense, dosage, price per dose, commercial arrangements In adults, offer any of the currently approved biologic therapies as firstline therapy, substituting a different approved biologic should the first one fail. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) antagonists or interleukin 17 antagonists should be offered as first-line therapy for patients with psoriatic arthritis. Etanercept can be considered in TNF antagonist-eligible patients if other biologics have failed or cannot be used, or if a short halflife is important. Infliximab should be reserved for very severe disease or if age-based dosing is important, or if other biologics have failed or cannot be used. For pediatric patients, adalimumab can be offered for patients aged 4 years or older, etanercept for patients aged 6 years or older, or ustekinumab for those aged 12 years or older, if they meet the criteria for biologic therapy. If these agents do not provide an adequate response, a specialist in pediatric biologic therapy should be consulted, along with consideration of the following: - Advice about factors that may be contributing to the poor response, such as obesity and poor compliance - Optimization of adjunctive therapy, such as switching from oral to subcutaneous methotrexate - Supplementary or alternative nonbiologic therapies, such as inpatient topical therapy or systemic therapies Important contraindications to biologic therapies Contraindications for the use of biologic therapies in psoriasis patients are as follows: - TNF antagonist use with demyelinating diseases (and possible use of alternative therapies in those with firstdegree relatives with demyelinating disease) - TNF antagonist use with severe cardiac failure (New York Heart Association class III and IV) - Inflammatory bowel disease, which warrants gastroenterology specialist consultation before offering brodalumab, ixekizumab, or secukinumab - Relative contraindication in people undergoing elective surgery Guidelines on the management and treatment of psoriasis with biologics by the American Academy of Dermatology and the National Psoriasis Foundation [ [60](javascript:void(0);)] TNF-alpha Inhibitors Etanercept recommendations are as follows: - Monotherapy treatment option for adults with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis - Recommended starting dose of 50 mg;

When approved, the dose will likely be 150 mg given by self-administered subcutaneous injections at week 0 and week 4, followed by every 12 weeks. Clinical Practice Guidelines on Prescribing Oral Cyclosporine in Dermatology Guidelines on the safe and effective prescribing of oral cyclosporine in dermatology by the British Association of Dermatologists [ [61](javascript:void(0);)] Cyclosporine is licensed for use in the following indications: - Atopic dermatitis (in persons aged 16 years or older) - Psoriasis (in persons aged 16 years or older) Good evidence supports the use of cyclosporine outside its product license for the following indications: - Atopic dermatitis (in persons younger than 16 years) - Beh\u00e7et disease - Chronic spontaneous (idiopathic) urticaria - Graft versus host disease - Palmoplantar pustulosis - Pyoderma gangrenosum Cyclosporine should be used only as a last resort in the following indications, and current evidence shows it is unlikely to be beneficial: - Alopecia vulgaris Continuous treatment may be considered for select patients with chronic skin disease in the appropriate situation; however, in an effort to reduce nephrotoxicity, use single or intermittent short courses of up to 16 weeks if possible. Cyclosporine dose titration during therapy also should be used to reduce nephrotoxicity. If hypertension occurs, the cyclosporine dose should be reduced and/or the hypertension should be treated. If appropriate blood pressure cannot be maintained, discontinue cyclosporine. If infection is suspected, consider obtaining consult on the safety of inducing immunosuppression; ensure all necessary treatment is being administered before beginning cyclosporine. Patients should be advised to seek advice early if febrile illness occurs or their skin condition rapidly worsens. Owing to a longterm risk of developing nonmelanoma skin cancer, cyclosporine should not be administered concurrently with phototherapy. Serum lipid levels should be measured for a baseline and should be monitored throughout treatment; this is especially important in patients considered high risk (eg, diabetics, those with preexisting hyperlipidemia). Clinical Practice Guidelines on Phototherapy for Psoriasis Guidelines on the m anagement and treatment of psoriasis with phototherapy from the American Academy of Dermatology and the National Psoriasis Foundation [ [62](javascript:void(0);)] Narrowband ultraviolet B phototherapy Phototherapy using narrowband ultraviolet B (NB-UVB) is recommended as monotherapy for adults with plaque psoriasis. For adults with generalized plaque psoriasis, the recommended NB-UVB phototherapy starting dose should be based on the minimal erythema dose or it should be determined based on a fixed-dose or skin-phototype protocol. For adults with generalized plaque psoriasis, a treatment phase of thrice-weekly dosing of NB-UVB phototherapy is recommended. For adults with treatment with short-term psoralen plus ultraviolet A (PUVA) monotherapy is more effective than NB-UVB. Owing to its increased safety, higher convenience, and lower cost, NB-UVB is preferred over PUVA monotherapy for psoriasis in adults, even though it is less effective. In adults with generalized plaque psoriasis, NB-UVB is recommended over broadband ultraviolet B (BB-UVB) monotherapy. Treatment with NB-UVB monotherapy is recommended for guttate psoriasis patients, regardless of their age. For appropriate patients with generalized plaque psoriasis, home-based NB-UVB phototherapy is recommended as NB-UVB phototherapy. Treatment with NB-UVB phototherapy is recommended for pregnant patients who have guttate psoriasis or generalized plaque psoriasis. As a measure to possibly improve efficacy, NB-UVB phototherapy can be safely augmented with concomitant topical therapy using retinoids, vitamin D analogues, and corticosteroids. Oral retinoids can be combined with NB-UVB phototherapy in appropriate patients with generalized plaque psoriasis if they have not responded adequately to monotherapy. Owing to an increased risk of developing skin cancer, long-term combination therapy with NB-UVB and cyclosporine is not recommended for adults with generalized plaque psoriasis. Apremilast combined with NB-UVB phototherapy can be considered for adult patients with generalized plaque psoriasis if they have not responded adequately to monotherapy. To reduce the risk of genital skin cancer, all patients receiving NB-UVB phototherapy should be provided genital shielding. To reduce the risk of ocular toxicity, all patients receiving NB-UVB phototherapy should be provided eye protection with goggles. Owing to the risk of photocarcinogenesis, use caution when administering NB-UVB phototherapy to patients with a history of melanoma or multiple nonmelanoma skin cancers, arsenic intake, or prior exposure to ionizing radiation. Folate supplementation is recommended for females of childbearing age who are receiving NB-UVB phototherapy. To maintain the clinical response from NB-UVB phototherapy, maintenance therapy can be considered. BB-UVB phototherapy In adults with generalized plaque psoriasis, BB-UVB phototherapy is recommended as monotherapy if NB-UVB is not available. In adults with generalized plaque psoriasis, BB-UVB monotherapy is considered less efficacious than NB-UVB or oral PUVA monotherapy. Monotherapy with BB-UVB may be considered for adults with guttate psoriasis. To reduce the risk of genital skin cancer, all patients being offered BB-UVB phototherapy should be provided with genital shielding. To reduce the risk of ocular toxicity, all patients receiving BB-UVB phototherapy should be provided eye protection with goggles. Owing to the risk of photocarcinogenesis, use caution when administering BB-UVB phototherapy to patients with a history of melanoma or multiple nonmelanoma skin cancers, arsenic intake, or prior exposure to ionizing radiation. Combination therapy with acitretin and BB-UVB can be considered in adults with generalized plaque psoriasis. Targeted UVB phototherapy The recommended targeted UVB phototherapy for adults with localized plaque psoriasis (< 10% body surface area), for individual plaque psoriasis lesions, or for patients with more extensive disease includes excimer 308-nm laser, excimer 308-nm light, and targeted NB-UVB 311- to 313-nm light. For maximal efficacy, the recommended treatment frequency for targeted UVB phototherapy in adults with localized plaque psoriasis is 2-3 times per week, rather than once every 1-2 weeks. In adults with localized plaque psoriasis, the initial dose of targeted UVB phototherapy is based on the minimal erythema dose or by a fixed-dose or skin-phototype protocol. For treating localized plaque psoriasis in adults, the most effective targeted UVB phototherapy is excimer 308-nm laser, followed by excimer 308-nm light, followed by localized NB-UVB 311- to 312-nm light. For adults with plaque psoriasis (including palmoplantar psoriasis), a recommended targeted UVB phototherapy includes excimer 308-nm laser and excimer 308-nm light. Treatment of plaque psoriasis in adults with excimer 308-nm laser may be combined with topical steroid therapy. A recommended targeted UVB phototherapy treatment for adults with scalp psoriasis is excimer 308-nm laser. PUVA therapy In the treatment of localized plaque psoriasis in adults, particularly those with palmoplantar psoriasis or palmoplantar pustular psoriasis, superior to NB-UVB 311- to 313-nm light. A recommended treatment for psoriasis in adults is oral PUVA. A recommended treatment for moderate-to-severe psoriasis in adults is bath PUVA. Photodynamic therapy Photodynamic therapy with either aminolevulinic acid or methyl aminolevulinate is not recommended for adults with localized psoriasis, including the palmoplantar variety or nail psoriasis. Grenz ray, climatotherapy, visible light, Goeckerman, and pulsed-dye laser therapies Evidence is insufficient to recommend grenz ray therapy (long-wavelength ionizing radiation) for the treatment of psoriasis. Sufficient evidence exists to recommend climatotherapy (temporary or permanent relocation geographically) for the treatment of psoriasis. Evidence is insufficient to recommend the use of visible light (blue or red) as a more effective treatment for psoriasis, except in nail psoriasis. Sufficient evidence exists to recommend Goeckerman therapy (coal tar in combination with UVB phototherapy) for the treatment of psoriasis. Pulsed-dye laser can be considered for nail psoriasis.
