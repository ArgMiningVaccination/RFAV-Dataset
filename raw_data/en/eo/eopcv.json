Are you on a spiritual journey needing guidance, clarity and community? Or feeling energetically depleted and in need of nourishment and replenishment? Led by in-house healer [Tor Njamo](https://glasshousesalon.co.uk/blogs/journal/introducing-tor-njamo-psychic-healer-and-wellbeing-coach), join us for an afternoon of spiritual growth, clarity, calm and connection with like-minded individuals. Duration: 90 min Time: Mare Street, E8 3RH Over the last few decades, more people have become aware of the chakras and their interaction with our earthly existence. But what are they really, and how can we benefit from learning about and interacting with them? In our August 6th session Tor will specifically focus on the base (or red) chakra. If this chakra is imbalanced it can create a sense of scarcity and lack, as well as an unhealthy attachment to material objects or desires. Bringing the base chakra into balance creates a sense of grounding, safety, security and connection to mother earth. In our September 10th session, Tor will specifically focus on the spleen (or orange) chakra. If this chakra is imbalanced, it can create a lack of purpose and motivation. Bringing the orange spleen chakra back into balance creates a sense of confidence, self-belief and trust in one's own strengths. In our October 8th session, Tor will specifically focus on the stomach (or yellow) chakra. If this chakra is imbalanced, it can create a general feeling of negativity and confusion. Bringing the yellow stomach chakra back into balance creates a sense of optimism, courage and joy. Tor will open the session by sharing a collective message from Spirit before introducing the chakra system. He will then explore techniques to energetically restore and rebalance through the power of guided visual meditation. He will encourage you to tune into the red base chakra and explore your potential for healing in this area. As a part of the meditation, Tor will circulate the room providing individual hands-on healing. To close our circle, each participant will receive a two-card tarot reading. After the meditation, time will be taken to share as much or as little as you like of how you felt and answer any last questions, as well as setting out personal intentions for the week ahead. Leave the session feeling calm and relaxed -connected with your intuition, with a sense of community and belonging. Limited to 10 people. The session is for all spiritual seekers regardless of where you are on your spiritual journey; this is a safe space where we can learn from each other. We recommend you wear comfortable attire.
