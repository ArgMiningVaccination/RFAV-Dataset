A wise Samoan orator-chief likened the process of eff ective engagement to the meeting of two family groups for the fi rst time. In a traditional Samoan setting, the parties would use fa'atalatalanoa. Despite the literal meaning of 'talking about nothing' , Talanoa is widely used to cover anything from general through to more meaningful conversations at many diff erent levels1. Fa'atalatalanoa however is more purposive, deliberate and action-orientated dialogue, which oft en has an end- goal in mind. When frontline workers meet Pacifi c clients for the fi rst time, they must not only engage positively with them, they must also take the opportunity to switch from a talanoa to a fa'atalatalanoa process. Th is is facilitated by positive and appropriate engagement at this critical fi rst point of contact. An eff ective analogy for this is the paepae or surrounding pebble courtyard of the Samoan fale (house), which also includes the space in front of the fale. In traditional Samoan custom, this is the space where formal engagement mostly begins when two parties meet for the fi rst time. Here is where the introductory speeches and gafa2 connections are made, oft en by a skilled orator or tulafale bearing his to'oto'o and fue3. Th e purpose here is clear - to connect, establish a va, and defi ne the purpose of the visit. When therapists and front-line workers meet Pacifi c service users, they will need to be aware of the paepae eff ect. Th is is where pre-engagement is crucial, for it is here that the preparations are made to create a relationship or va. I would like to thank our contributing authors Denise Kingi-Uluave and Epenesa Olo-Whaanga who have likened this process to rolling out a metaphorical mat or fofola e fala . Th is is essentially where the building of va begins, but does not end . Th e success of the ensuing fa'atalatalanoa will then be dependent on how you nurture the relationship or tausi le va. It is my hope that this manual will be your to'oto'o and fue as you seek to serve our people through the nurturing of the va. Soifua Dr Monique Faleafa (DClinPsy) National Manager, Le Va 1. Tala means to tell or talk and noa means nothing or void. Hence, talanoa literally means to 'talk about nothing' in Tongan, many other Pacifi c languages (Fa'amatuainu Tino Periera, 30 May 2010, Presentation at Le Tautua Emerging Leaders Fono). 2.

Given the holistic nature of these relationships, any disturbance or imbalance may be associated with mental health diffi culties. Th is guide predominately presents ways of working with Pasifi ka individuals and their families. Consideration should also be given to the complex set of inter-relationships that exist between Pasifi ka communities and to the important role of spirituality in Pasifi ka people's lives. Th e New Zealand Mental Health Survey - Te Rau Hinengaro 1 , identifi ed that Pasifi ka peoples carry a higher burden of mental disorder than the general Aotearoa/New Zealand population, but that use of mental health services for Pasifi ka peoples with a serious mental disorder is only 25% compared to 58% for the total Aotearoa/New Zealand population. A major challenge for Pasifi ka communities is stigma and the need to demystify mental illness and psychological issues. Talking therapies have strong potential to address these i ssues, provided the initial engagement process is a positive experience for Pasifi ka families It is also important to acknowledge the cultural and intergenerational diversity that exists among Pasifi ka people. Th e level of acculturation of individuals and families will determine the extent to which the recommendations in this guide apply. While each family will be unique, and families will vary in their level of acculturation, pre-engagement approaches recommended in this guide can help build understanding of how Pasifi ka families are positioned within a social, historical and economic context. Within Pasifi ka cultural world views, considerable signifi cance is placed on developing and maintaining relationships. As a result, the importance of understanding the context in which Pasifi ka peoples operate, and of establishing a solid and trusting therapeutic relationship, cannot be underestimated when working with Pasifi ka peoples. Particular emphasis has therefore been given to cultural considerations in the engagement section of this guide. It is likely that unless cultural considerations are addressed at the fi rst point of contact, then eff ective assessment and therapy are unlikely to eventuate. Th roughout this guide, processes are presented that may help the therapist build rapport and maintain engagement with Pasifi ka populations. Th is process is likened to 'rolling out the metaphorical mat' and inviting the person to come sit, before entering into therapy - the vaka/ va'a (a raft or vessel). Much of the knowledge, skills and attitudes identifi ed in this guide align and support the principles identifi ed in the Ministry of Health's Let's get real framework and Real Skills Plus Seitapu. It is important to highlight that no systematic research on talking therapies with Pasifi ka populations has so far been published. Due to th is limited research on evidence-based psychological interventions for Pasifi ka people, a practice-based observations approach was employed in 5producing this guide, involving consultation with therapists (both Pasifi ka and non-Pasifi ka) and people who have used mental health and addiction services. Information collection involved a national consultation process, using a multi-method approach, which included a brief literature review, focus groups held in Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch, and interviews with key informants. While the information and recommendations in this guide could be seen as best (and promising) practice for talking therapies when working with Pasifi ka peoples, we emphasise that some suggestions may or may not be applicable in individual situations. While therapists interviewed for this guide identifi ed several talking therapy models that were useful when working with Pasifi ka people, they strongly identifi ed that in their practice, they modifi ed, adapted or used parts of these models eclectically. It appears that having several models to draw on as a therapist helps to meet service users' needs more holistically. Th erapists also did not believe that 'manualised'-type approaches were fl exible enough to allow for this. Hence, it appears that a high level of sophistication, confi dence and competence is necessary when working with Pasifi ka peoples. In general this guide is written to provide information for people working in and using mental health and addiction services. It therefore has a clear clinical focus. It may also be useful for non-government organisations and other agencies involved with counselling Pasifi ka families. A successful outcome in therapy will depend on many factors. It will be reliant on the most appropriate and eff ective therapeutic intervention being tailored to meet the particular needs of the individual. It also depends on the experience (clinical and cultural) of the therapist and their confi dence in the interventions they are delivering. Pasifi ka peoples need to have trust and confi dence that their cultural and clinical needs will be acknowledged and respected. Th e lack of talking therapies research points to the critical need for culturally appropriate research to build Aotearoa/New Zealand's evidence base for 'what Denise Kingi-Uluave and Epenesa Olo-Whaanga were the major contributing authors and researchers of this guide. Like our ancient skilled navigators, they have navigated unchartered waters on behalf of our entire Pacifi c mental health and addiction sector and mapped out the beginnings of an exciting journey.

While there is no single agreed defi nition of recovery, in this country it is oft en referred to as 'living well in the presence, or absence of mental health problems. '2 Recovery as part of a person's journey to wellness will oft en require a combination of biological, social, cultural and psychological interventions. As evidence continues to grow for, and society becomes more aware of, the eff ectiveness of talking therapies, people who use mental health and addiction services are requesting better access to quality talking therapies. In response to these requests, Te Pou is working to improve access to talking therapies for service users of mental health and addiction services. Te Pou has produced a number of reports ( www.tepou.co.nz ): a) We Need to Talk3 - examined the most commonly used therapies in Aotearoa/New Zealand mental health and addiction services. Th is report also identifi ed which therapies, if introduced more widely, could produce more positive change for those accessing this sector. b) We Need to Listen4 - summarises the issues raised during the feedback process on We Need to Talk and proposed a more formal consultation process. c) We Need to Ac t5 - provides a summary of the results from the feedback process, and information on a literature review that explored evidence for cognitive behavioural therapy, motivational interviewing and dialectical behavioural therapy. Th is report also outlines a framework for introducing talking therapies and recommends action points. d) Action Plan for Talking Th erapies 2009 to 2011 - describes the actions, timeframes and processes to increase the quality, sustainability and spread of talking therapies for users of mental health and addiction services in Aotearoa/New Zealand. In addition, Te Pou has produced A Guide to Talking Th erapies in New Zealand 6, which focuses on providing information to service users and families who want to increase their knowledge on the talking therapies available in Aotearoa/New Zealand. (Th is guide can be downloaded from the Te Pou website www.tepou.co.nz.) Th e Action Plan for Talking Th erapies identifi ed the need to develop a best (and promising) practice guide for mental health and addiction staff who provide talking therapies for Pasifi ka people and their families. Taking action on this recommendation is critical, given the results reported in the New Zealand Mental Health Survey: Te Rau Hinengaro 1. Th is research identifi ed that Pasifi ka people carry a higher burden of mental disorder than the general Aotearoa/New Zealand population, yet the use of mental health services by Pasifi ka peoples with a serious mental disorder is only 25% compared to 58% of the total Aotearoa/New Zealand population. It is theorised that one of the reasons for the low uptake of mental health and addiction services by Pasifi ka peoples may be associated with the way they perceive health and mental health. Th e more traditional Pasifi ka perspectives of mental illness, particularly amongst older generations, view mental illness as spiritual, in that you are either possessed or being punished for past sins 10committed by family members7 . Th e use of traditional healers and an alternative traditional aetiology to frame mental illness experiences are some of the issues that may need to be considered when delivering talking therapies. This project Th is guide was collated using several methods. A literature review specifi cally related to Pasifi ka and talking therapies was carried out. It was acknowledged at the outset that there would be a dearth of specifi c research in this area. To compensate for this, the views and experiences of therapists working with Pasifi ka peoples in the mental health and addiction fi eld were sought. Consumer representatives were also consulted. Participants were recruited via a snowball sampling strategy, using clinical and Pasifi ka networks. Participant selection was based on identifying those people who could most inform this project ('information-rich' participants 8) and their availability within the allocated timeframes. Focus groups or fono were held in Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch, with both Pasifi ka and non-Pasifi ka participants. Key informants were also interviewed either in person or by telephone. Fono group interviews were taped, transcribed and thematically analysed. Th emes were cross- validated between the researchers. Limitations of the guide Given the limited research available on evidence-based talking therapies with Pasifi ka peoples, information presented in this guide is reliant on practice-based observations elicited from therapists and service users of mental health and addiction services. As Pasifi ka peoples under-utilise mental health and addiction services, very few are referred for talking therapy. A greater pool of participants, would have further increased confi dence in the recommendations of this guide. Th ere are a very limited number of Pasifi ka therapists trained to deliver the extensive range of therapeutic approaches now available to service users. Consequently, it is diffi cult to confi rm which types of therapy, if delivered by a Pasifi ka therapist, would be eff ective with Pasifi ka people. Th e Pasifi ka population in Aotearoa/New Zealand encompasses a diverse range of people, each with their own specifi c beliefs, values, language and customs. Further research into talking therapies with ethnic-specifi c groups is necessary to ensure appropriate and eff ective therapies are provided. Older Pasifi ka peoples are less likely to access mental health and addiction services. As a result, limited information was acquired on talking therapies with people from this age group, making it diffi cult to extrapolate which therapeutic approaches are helpful for them. Possible reasons for not accessing therapy include: most were born in the islands and therefore may prefer to access traditional healers, as there is oft e n a v i e w t h a t m e n t a l i l l n e s s i s c a u s e d b y a b r e a c h o f t a p u o r s p i r i t u a l possession mental health and addiction services may not be culturally appropriate for the needs of Pasifi ka populations these people may prefer to be cared for by family members due to issues related to stigma and shame. 11purpose and target audience Th is guide assumes that readers are familiar with the essential knowledge, skills and attitudes required to deliver eff ective mental health and addiction services, as described in the Ministry of Health Let's get real framework. Th e Let's get real framework explicitly states the expectations for people who work in mental health and addiction services, irrespective of their role, discipline or position in an organisation. Further information on Let's get real is discussed in Section Two - Principles of Engagement. In addition, Real Skills Plus Seitapu provides a framework for the essential and desirable knowledge, skills and attitudes of any person in the mental health and addiction workforce who is working with Pasifi ka people or families. Th is document can be downloaded from the Le Va website ( www.leva.co.nz/page/14-projects+seitapu ). Real Skills Plus Seitapu is intended to better inform staff in mental health and addiction services who work therapeutically with Pasifi ka peoples and their families about culturally safe practices and talking therapies that are particularly appropriate for the Pasifi ka population. It may also be a useful resource for general practitioners and therapists who are not engaged in therapy as it provides helpful suggestions for building rapport and engaging with Pasifi ka people. Le Va, Pasifi ka within Te Pou also support Pasifi ka Engagement training. It is strongly recommended that staff have access to regular cultural supervision when working with Pasifi ka service users. pasifika peoples in aotearoa/new zealand Th e information presented in this section has been sourced from Statistics New Zealand9. Th e demographics of Aotearoa/New Zealand are rapidly changing, resulting in an increasingly diverse and multi-cultural society. Th e Pasifi ka community makes up 6.9% (265,974) of the total population and consists of people from a variety of Pacifi c Island nations who celebrate and maintain their own specifi c languages, beliefs, values and traditions. Samoan's make up 49% of the Pasifi ka population followed is projected to increase to 599,000. 58% of Pasifi ka peoples residing in Aotearoa/New Zealand were born in this country. Th e majority of Pasifi ka peoples (almost 93.4%) live in the North Island, with the largest numbers (66.9%) living in the Auckland region. Nearly 40% of Pasifi ka peoples in Aotearoa/New Zealand are under the age of 15 years, with increasing numbers of these younger people identifying with more than one ethnicity and speaking more than one language. Th e median age for Pasifi ka peoples is 21 years, compared to 35.9 years for the total population. Just over 8 in 10 Pasifi ka peoples identifi ed with the Christian religion.12common health issues for pasifika peoples Pasifi ka peoples experience poorer health outcomes than the general Aotearoa/New Zealand population. Th e Ministry of Health reports that Pasifi ka peoples die younger and have higher rates of chronic diseases. Social and economic factors are known to contribute signifi cantly to Pasifi ka people's relatively poor health status. Th e Ministry of Health reports that (www.moh.govt. nz/pacifi c): Cardiovascular disease is the principal cause of death for Pasifi ka peoples and cardiovascular mortality rates are consistently and signifi cantly higher than for the general population. Mortality rates for cerebrovascular disease (stroke) are higher for Pasifi ka peoples than for any other ethnic group. Ethnic disparities in cancer survival have increased in the past 25 years and are a major cause of premature mortality and disability. Th e prevalence of diabetes in Pasifi ka populations is approximately three times higher than among other New Zealanders. Pasifi ka men have higher rates of lung cancer and primary liver cancer than other New Zealand men. Pasifi ka women have higher rates of breast and cervical cancer than other New Zealand women. Pasifi ka children have higher rates of hospitalisation for acute and chronic respiratory and infectious diseases than any other group in Aotearoa/New Zealand. Te Rau Hinengaro concluded that: Th ese poor physical health outcomes will constitute both acute and chronic life stressors for Pasifi ka peoples, thereby also placing them at greater risk for poorer mental health outcomes1. In fact, research shows that those with chronic physical conditions experience higher rates of mental disorders, particularly for anxiety and mood disorders, than people without physical conditions.13mental health issues for pasifika peoples Te Rau Hinengaro1 identifi ed that Pasifi ka peoples experience higher levels of mental disorder than the general population. Th e survey also reports that: Pasifi ka people experienced higher rates of mental disorder (25%) compared with the general Aotearoa/New Zealand population (20.7%). Th e most commonly reported lifetime disorders were anxiety disorders (16.2%), mood disorders (8.6%) and substance use disorders (5.3%). Pasifi ka people have a higher 12-month prev alence of suicidal ideation (4.5%) and suicide attempts (1.2%) than the general population. Y ounger Pasifi ka peoples (aged 16 to 24 years) have higher rates of mental disorder than their older Pasifi ka cohort. People's age at migration was signifi cant, as those who migrated to Aotearoa/New Zealand before 18 years of age had a lower prevalence of mental health disorders. Males have higher rates of substance use diso rders and females have higher rates of anxiety and mood disorders. addiction issues for pasifika peoples Although there are proportionally more non-drinkers in Pasifi ka communities than the general population, those who do drink tend to do so to harmful levels10. Te Rau Hinengaro1 found that Pasifi ka peoples have higher rates of alcohol abuse than the general population. In addition, a study by Haukau et al11 identifi ed: 57% of Pasifi ka drinkers (males 61%, females 51%), compared with 85% of the general Aotearoa/New Zealand population (males 88%, females 83%). Pasifi ka peoples report higher incidents of violence and injury from other people's drinking. Pasifi ka drinkers report more problems from violence and serious arguments as a result of their own drinking compared with the general Aotearoa/New Zealand population. In general, the use of drug and alcohol services by Pasifi ka peoples is very low, at 27% less than the national average12. However, Pasifi ka youth (aged 15 to 19 years) appear to use these services as frequently as any other New Zealand young people. Th e Pasifi ka population has been identifi ed as being the most at-risk ethnic group in Aotearoa/ New Zealand for developing problem or pathological gambling behaviours. A 1991 study reported Pasifi ka peoples made up to 14% of pathological and problem gamblers in Aotearoa/New Zealand13.14time context time environment context time environment familyphysical spiritual mental otherculture cultural world views for pasifika peoples Th ere are some unique elements in the world views of Pasifi ka peoples. A few of these key diff erences are highlighted here for Samoan and Tongan world views. A Pasifi ka world view and identity is described as being based on a collective approach, which is governed by a complex set of inter-relationships between individuals, their families and their communities. Th ese relationships are oft en upheld through adherence to a set of core values and practices. Western world views and paradigms usually centre on the notion of individualism. Th e focus on self, rather than others, is highly regarded in individualist cultures 14 . Tongan world view Th e traditional Tongan social structure is based on a hierarchical system of commoner ( kau ), with strong social rules that determine the level of power and authority one has in the community. As Mafi le' o says, \"Tongans are entwined with a matrix of multiple and complex inter-relationships. Th ere are principles and values which govern the operation of inter-relationships and which in turn constitute well-being within a Tongan worldview perspective\" 15. Samoan world view Oral traditions as opposed to written traditions are usually given diff erent levels of signifi cance in the Samoan world view. Th e Samoan self is described as a relational being, not an independent being. Th erefore, a Samoan person is legitimised by their relationships with others. Th is has a bearing on the sacredness of relationships both to people, land and spirituality. It guides the use of language, proximity and appropriate boundaries. Th is can be at odds with the modern western world with its notions of free-will, choices and independence 16 . In a Pasifi ka view of health, a positive and balanced relationship between the three elements of Atua (God), tagata (people) and laufanua (environment) is required in order to maintain well- being17. Several core values are identifi ed that are common to Pasifi ka groups and underpin relationships in a Pasifi ka context. Th ese include, amongst others, notions of tapu (scared bonds), alofa (love and compassion), tautua (reciprocal service), fa'aaloal o (respect and deference), fa'amaualalo (humility) and aiga (family)7. stigma for pasifika peoples Traditional Pasifi ka approaches to mental illness will oft en diff er from the Western medical notion of illness as a result of 'chemical imbalance' . In a Pasifi ka context, the cause of mental illness may be viewed as spiritual or inherited, and thus treated by 'spiritual healers' or traditional methods of healing. Th e presence of mental illness may be shaming for Pasifi ka families due to traditional spiritual explanations (e.g. as punishment from God, or a curse due to a family wrong) 18.Th erefore, it is important to acknowledge traditional Pasifi ka beliefs and to be cognisant of the stigma surrounding mental illness, particularly among the older Pasifi ka population.15national evidence Extensive evidence exists on the eff ectiveness of talking therapies for many mental health and addiction disorders. However, to date there is a paucity of research both nationally and internationally on evidence-based treatments for Pasifi ka peoples. Studies have generally omitted descriptions and analyses of cultural, spiritual and ethnic data. In addition, due to a lack of minority group representation, studies have been unable to produce suffi cient statistical power to demonstrate the interventions' eff ectiveness with minority populations 19. Most psychotherapies are based on Western philosophical frameworks, which are individualistic in focus and in fundamental discord with the Pasifi ka worldview. Th e Pasifi ka view is based on a holistic collective approach grounded in notions of spirituality, connectedness and a complex set of inter-relationships between individuals, their families and their communities. Th is discrepancy in theoretical frameworks presents a challenge for the acceptability and applicability of the evidence-based talking therapies for Pasifi ka peoples. Southwick and Solomona state that, \"Little research has occurred to begin to mediate this polarity\" , referring to \"a cultural diff erence of understanding between the body of knowledge that constitutes a western bio-psycho-social explanation of mental health and mental illness and Pacifi c people' holistic world views. \" Th ey go on to suggest that: Pacifi c mental health requires the development of a pedagogical approach that makes explicit the competing epistemologies so that practitioners can be guided to develop their practice in a coherent and measurable way. Th is process would aid the articulations of 'best practice' 21. Healing in the Samoan culture necessitates work ing with a Samoan person's community and regard for their communal practices 22. Th is is oft en not taken into account in psychiatric services that work with an individual Samoan person (which is in fact an impossible construct). Past research has examined treatment interventions and practices for Pasifi ka alcohol and other drugs (AOD) services in Aotearoa/New Zealand. Th e fi ndings from this study revealed that: Th e most eff ective worker for Pacifi c people is someone who has sound knowledge of AOD, Pacifi c cultures and processes, and has the ability to integrate both Palangi (European) and Pacifi c knowledge to help their client 23. Research conducted in Aotearoa/New Zealand demonstrated that a culturally adapted 'manualised'-type CBT programme could be eff ective for use with adult Maori service users with depression24. Reductions in depressive symptoms and negative cognitions, as well as increased well-being in four culturally relevant dimensions were reported. Th is study also highlighted the importance of building rapport and developing a positive therapeutic alliance, including 'therapist self-disclosure, exploration of whakapapa, the esta blishment of connections and engagement with relevant whanau' .16international evidence On an international level, there is a growing amount of research emerging that investigates the use of talking therapies with minority or indigenous groups. In particular, cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) has been modifi ed and trialled with some success 25. In a study that adapted a CBT intervention for depression with Haitian American youth, the researchers argued that, if done without regard for their culture, implementing an evidence-based treatment could further alienate young people 20. Aft er following a consultation process to adapt talking therapies for this population, certain changes to the CBT manual were suggested, such as using more culturally relevant examples, language, metaphors, pictures, spirituality, cultural rationale for the onset of depression, and the use of traditional remedies. Th ere were also structural issues identifi ed such as time, place, and agenda setting that required attention. Th e importance of the therapeutic alliance was also identifi ed in research examining the utility of CBT for the Latino population 25. Th is research highlighted the importance of building rapport through self-disclosure (sharing background information) and integrating religious aspects (prayer and church attendance) into the therapeutic intervention. Th e report concluded that,\"Decades of research indicate that the provision of therapy is an interpersonal process in which a main curative component is the nature of the therapeutic relationship\" 26. Many experienced therapists, regardless of theoretical orientation, acknowledge that the therapeutic relationship is a vehicle by which therapeutic change occurs. pasifika models of health Pasifi ka people's well-being is defi ned by the equilibrium of mind, body, spirituality, family and environment. To capture this holistic view of health and well-being, various ethnic-specifi c Pasifi ka frameworks have been developed7. Th ese metaphoric frameworks capture a holistic view of health and well-being and can also assist in the process of developing meaningful dialogue between service user and practitioner. Th ey have also been incorporated into research methodologies to ensure cultural exclusivity throughout the research process 27 . Th ree commonly referred to models are described further in this guide: the Samoan Fonofale model created by Fuimaono model developed by Konai Tivaevae Maua-Hodge. The Fonofale model28 Th e Fonofale model is a Pasifi ka model of health for use in the Aotearoa/New Zealand context and depicts a visual representation of a fale (a traditional Samoan meeting house) with four main posts ( pou-tu ). Th e model essentially identifi es six dimensions of health. Th e foundation ( fa'avae ) that the fale is built upon represents the nuclear and extended family ( aiga) and forms the fundamental basis of social organisation. Th e pou-tu represent four further dimensions of health, namely:17 fa'aleagaga (the spiritual dimension) - the sense of inner well-being, encompassing beliefs around Christianity, traditional spirits and nature fa'aletino (the physical dimension) - the well-being of the body, which is measured by the absence of illness and pain mafaufau (the mental dimension) - the well-being of the mind isi mea (the dimension of other) - encompasses variables such as fi nance, gender, age, education and sexual orientation. Above the Pou-tu , the roof ( falealuga of culture ( aganu'u ), the values, attitudes and beliefs of Pasifi ka culture. Surrounding these six dimensions of health is the environment, context and time relevant to the individual, which have either a direct or indirect infl uence upon one another. As with the Maori model of health - Te Whare Tapa Wha - the dimensions are interwoven and interdependent, so that altered states of wellness only occur when one or more of the dimensions are out of balance 29. The Kakala model 30 Th e Kakala model is based on Tongan values and principles of reciprocity, sharing, respect, collectivism and context-specifi c skills and knowledge. It is an integrated framework used to describe the processes involved in research (gathering knowledge and information, analysing and organising the information, and dissemination of results) and is likened to the practice of making kakala (garlands). Some Pasifi ka therapists use this framework when working with Pasifi ka service users. Making kakala involves three major processes toli, tui and luva. Toli refers to the skills required when gathering the materials (fl owers, leaves etc) needed to make the kakala , including knowledge and experience in gathering materials at the right time and right place. Gathering materials must be done with respect and requires certain expertise. Tui is the actual making or weaving of the kakala . Luva is the fi nal process that involves the giving away or presentation of the kakala . It is based on sacred values of fa (respect) and ofa (compassion) for the person for whom the kakala is made. In this Tongan perspective, the kakala is always made to be given away. The Tivaevae model Th is model, developed by Maua-Hodge, uses processes followed by Cook Island women to make a Tivaevae or quilt. One person has the design and allocates diff erent roles and responsibilities to other women in the group. Each has specifi c tasks to accomplish. Working together as a team ensures all patterns and parts of the Tivaevae will be sewn together in the appropriate way and a high-quality garment is produced. Under the model, within a team of diverse researchers, the principal researcher will allocate tasks to the individual researchers. When these tasks are completed, the data is returned to the team who work together to analyse the information and produce a fi nal, high-quality report. 18Full page photo image (rolled up mat) 19PRINCIPLES OF ENGAGEMENT It is generally agreed that eff ective intervention for people accessing mental health and addiction services is reliant upon accurate assessment and formulation of the issues that a person is presenting with. Th ese issues include life stressors, as well as historical, contextual and political struggles. Eliciting such pertinent and oft en sensitive information from Pasifi ka service users requires more than simply asking questions. It also entails conn ecting and engaging with them at a level that evokes hope, respect and a trusting relationship. pre-engagement Pasifi ka peoples, particularly those born in the Pacifi c Islands, may be unfamiliar with the concept of mental illness and some may still perceive mental un-wellness as caused by a breach of tapu or more closely connected with the spiritual realm. Th erefore, pre-engagement preparation is vital to facilitate a successful therapeutic engagement pr ocess and to avoid a potentially negative or embarrassing situations for both the therapist and the service user. It is diffi cult for many families to admit that their family member needs professional help or care. It eff ectively says on one level that despite all their love, care, resources and networks, the person needs help. Th is is one of the most diffi cult steps to take, to trust strangers to care for their loved one and help them. For Pasifi ka families a sense of guilt and shame can also be associated with an inability to bear the full burden of care for their family member. Consequently, they may have exhausted other channels (e.g. alternative treatments or traditional healers) prior to accessing mental health or addiction services, thereby making pre-engagement and engagement even more critical. To assist with rapport building and developing a meaningful connection with Pasifi ka service users and their families it may be useful to consider the following. personal and professional practice issues To build rapport and work eff ectively with Pasifi ka peoples, it is essential as a therapist to: convey compassion and genuine care31 h ave self refl exivity (having an appreciation of cultural diff erences requires an understanding of one's own position or culture) understand that your position or cultural view may not apply to the Pasifi ka person (even if you are a Pasifi ka therapist). If working with Pasifi ka service users on an ongoing basis, gaining rudimentary cultural knowledge (for example about world views, values, cultural protocols and nuances) is respectful and will most likely be warmed to. Th ose not conversant with cultural rules can unintentionally breach them and are at risk of missing rich information oft en conveyed verbally or through body language 32. Draw on cultural expertise from others if you are out of your depth by seeking advice from a person belonging to the service users background, e.g. a matua (elder) or traditional healer.20If you continue to work with Pasifi ka service users, organise access to cultural supervision or advice on an ongoing basis. An awareness of religion and spirituality in the lives of many Pasifi ka families is also important, as this is particularly pertinent for Pasifi ka peoples. Pasifi ka peoples are oft en as comfortable talking about matters of the spiritual realm, as they are about matters in the physical world. Making an eff ort to greet people in their own language can be interpreted as demonstrating respect and as a display of genuine caring. Th erefore, having an awareness of the Pasifi ka greetings can assist with rapport. Hospitality is a practice valued in Pasifi ka cultures and ensuring the service has suffi cient resources and fl exibility to allow for the provision of food where needed is an essential aspect of an organisation's commitment to eff ective engagement with Pasifi ka peoples. Th e spirit of hospitality extends beyond the therapist to the culture of the service. If other staff members are disrespectful to Pasifi ka service users, all the eff orts of the therapist may be undermined. Many of the suggestions above are ways to demonstrate two of the foundation skills for working with Pasifi ka peoples, outlined in Real Skills Plus Seitapu . Workers may need to acquire basic language skills across a range of Pasifi ka ethnic groups. Th is means being able to greet a person using the correct pronunciation, and using respectful body language when building rapport with service users and their families. Real Skills Plus Seitapu also emphasises the importance of being aware of the meaning of tapu for diff erent cultures. Th is awareness allows the practitioner to be sensitive to the boundaries of tapu within the context of their own practice, while working with service users and their immediate families. service delivery issues Referrals Th e quality and quantity of referral information received can vary signifi cantly. Before engaging with the person or their family it would be helpful to determine whether the information received is correct and attempt to elicit as much detail about the context in which the individual belongs and operates. Th is may include ethnicity, background information about the family, whether they were they born in Aotearoa/New Zealand or in the islands, their church or faith, who is in the family and who will be the main spokesperson for the family, any language barriers and whether an interpreter is required. Consent A major issue for Pasifi ka peoples is that referrals are oft en made without the consent of the family or that families have not been adequately informed about the purpose of the referral. Be aware that some families are only told they are being referred for extra help and do not always understand that they will be involved with a mental health or addiction service. Th us it may come as a surprise to them when contact is made. 21Appointments Th e Pasifi ka paradigm where relationships are priveledged does not always fi t comfortably into a western-based timeframe. When working with Pasifi ka families, a degree of fl exibility with the timeframes allocated for the engagement and assess ment process is required. It is recommended that time is taken to build rapport before starting a formal assessment. Attendance at appointments may be diffi cult for some Pasifi ka families. Having a degree of fl exibility and trying to limit the amount of assessment appointments people are expected to attend is likely to make it easier for families to engage with the service. Non-attendance may be due to a variety of reasons, in particular work commitments. Useful points to note are that: unless the service user and their family prefer to come into the service, home visits appear to be the preferred engagement option for many Pasifi ka peoples off ering a choice of venues and appointment times, such as the choices presented in the Choice and Partnership (CAPA) model33, may increase families' attendance and involvement with the service sending out appointment letters can reduce the number of non-attendances to appointments. Letters may be interpreted as the system showing respect or may simply act as a reminder on the day of the scheduled appointment, a telephone call or text message is a good method of reminding people of their appointment. Matching Cultural and intergenerational diversity exists not only between Pasifi ka nations but also within each ethnic group. Some Pasifi ka peoples born in Aotearoa/New Zealand are infl uenced by contemporary views and may not always adhere to traditional cultural perspectives34. For example, not all families will be comfortable with a prayer to begin a meeting or therapy session. However, it is important not to assume that culture is unimportant to all Aotearoa/New Zealand-born Pasifi ka peoples, as many are oft en still raised in families where Pasifi ka values, beliefs and traditions are strongly held and practised. Be guided by the person you are seeing. Given the relational and sacred boundaries that exist within many Pasifi ka cultures between brothers and sisters, and fathers and daughters, it may be helpful to take into consideration factors such as age, gender, hierarchies, social place (titles, nobility etc) and identity when engaging with Pasifi ka families. In particular, when addressing sensitive matters consideration may need to be given to whether the gender of the therapist is appropriate. At times, both male and female therapists (Pasifi ka and non-Pasifi ka) may elect to step back and supervise their colleagues of the opposite gender (if required to work outside their level of experience) in order to maintain the therapeutic engagement. Cultural advisor To increase the likelihood of a respectful engage ment process, it is imperative that the service has access to a cultural advisor or matua . Cultural advisors are not only a source of knowledge for the therapist, but pave the way for a respectful connection with the service user and their family, particularly for those families born in the Pacifi c Islands. Matua are well respected elders in the community, employed by a service and can facilitate the most appropriate protocols to enhance 22and guide the engagement. In most circumstances, unless the cultural aspect of engagement is observed, then it is unlikely that therapy will commence successfully, as you will not have established the va (relationship), which is critical when working with Pasifi ka peoples. In addition, having access to a therapist or cultural advisor or matua who is familiar with the service user's own culture and language can help facilitate a more open conversation without the fear of being misinterpreted. Service users and their families can also express and explain situations more fully in their language of choice and not feel embarrassed or frustrated when struggling to provide the equivalent English explanation. Th e use of interpreters can also help deal with these language issues. Naturally, this will require being guided by the service user and identifying what they will be comfortable with. Like other people, Pasifi ka service users may also value complete anonymity and not want to be identifi ed by members of their own ethnic group. 23 24engagement - relational connections \"Unfolding of the metaphorical mat and honouring the va.\" Maintaining respectful relationships is a central cultural tenet that exists across Pasifi ka cultures. An individual's health and well-being is reliant on safe and balanced connections with others. In understanding the nature of crisis or illness in a Pasifi ka person's life, the concept and relevance of va is pertinent. Literally va can mean 'space' - not the space that divides, but the space or relationships that connect. A va-centred approach to relationships emphasises that they are sacred and inclusive of harmony balance, reciprocity and mutual respect 35. Sir Mason Durie also refers to this sacred space within the context of the marae atea (the space directly in front of the marae): Th e use of space is a necessary accompaniment of encounters, providing not only physical territory but also the psychological space to rehearse identity and to confi rm the relationship between self and others 36. Consequently, acting in a manner that upholds relationships is imperative for many Pasifi ka families. Additionally, caring for family members is considered sacrosanct in Pasifi ka cultures and there is a commonly held belief that this duty of care brings blessings ( faamanuiaga ) to the family27. While the responsibility for caring for loved ones can be extremely supportive, it can also act as a barrier to accessing services during the early stages of un-wellness. Laying out the mat - \"we are here to serve\" In that fi rst encounter with Pasifi ka families, the therapist is encouraged to think about metaphorically rolling out a mat, a woven mat that the service user is encouraged to join. Th is is the creation of the va, a safe space, a space of encounter between therapist and service user, a relational space. By off ering the mat and being clear about the nature of the space, the therapist is creating connection between themselves and the other. Th e mat demonstrates the intention to form a relationship that is characterised by compassion, respect and uplift ing. Th en the service user is in a position to choose whether they join the therapist on that mat or not. To extend this metaphor further, it is expected that the therapist will sit cross-legged at that mat, at the same level as the service user, but also in a spirit of humility. Th is requires navigating an equilibrium between instilling confi dence in professional practice and genuine human warmth, care and humility. A skilled therapist will reassure a person that they are accepting of, and can cope with, whatever the service user chooses to bring onto the mat. Th e mat, ideally, will be able to function as a raft , from which the person is able to refl ect on all that is beneath. If this metaphor is extended further, the mat acts as a vessel, or as a vaka/va'a over an ocean. It opens up a range of illuminative metaphors. For example, the idea of navigation skills, the holding of maps, and the abilities and confi dence to weather any storms, currents and rough waters that may lie ahead. 25In many ways the stages of engagement can be likened to whether a person can trust the therapist and feel brave enough to get aboard the same vaka/va'a , which may or may not be therapeutic. If the family and service user do not trust in the therapist or the service, then they will not get on board. If they do not even make it onto the vaka/va'a for the therapeutic journey, then therapeutic benefi ts are unlikely to occur. Th e very fi rst step however, is preparation so that the person and their family are willing to enter into a relationship and join the therapist on the metaphorical mat. Attitude Th is mat is off ered with the understanding that it will engender a space of warmth, compassion and genuine care for the person, e.g. unconditional positive regard. Laying down this mat in the spirit of service, with humility, means being non-judgmental, respectful, displaying compassion and fl exibility. Th ese are attitudes that convey genuine interest and respect, thereby contributing to a meaningful relationship. By instilling confi dence and creating hope the beginning of trust is being developed. Th e person and their family feel assured that the therapist has the compassion and competence needed to help them navigate through this very diffi cult and oft en turbulent time. Face to face Spending time on the mat, face to face at fi rst point of contact, is vital to a successful journey. At this stage any confusion or miscommunication can be addressed. Th is process can be complemented but not substituted by a telephone conversation or written communication. \"Me being Pacifi c I know making the connection is vital whether it's a piece of paper with Talofa lava and a few mana enhancing words or a phone call, but more powerful and potent is the face to face contact. Making that extra eff ort to visit in the home displays a sense of genuineness. \" (Pasifi ka Th erapist) As mentioned previously, many Pasifi ka service users and their families prefer home visits to being seen at a mental health or addiction service. Th e social reality is that transport, parking, child care and shift work can all be barriers to appointment attendance. \"I think the extra eff ort alone, if you're not Pacifi c, and that persistence and genuineness, wanting to make a diff erence makes engagement much more likely, e.g. knocking on doors. \" (Pasifi ka Th erapist) If a home visit has been identifi ed as the preferred venue for contact, it is vital to have knowledge of basic cultural protocols and use existing relationships (for example the key worker or cultural advisor or matua could accompany the therapist to the home) to pave the way for a respectful encounter. It is not uncommon for therapists to take a small off ering of food when visiting people in their homes. During the fi rst point of contact, the time allocated should be brief with the main focus on rapport building, breaking down barriers, explaining the reasons for the therapist's involvement and what the service has to off er, and most importantly, providing a chance for the service user and family members to ask questions. It's about setting the right scene, balancing questions with respect and honouring their story. Very few questions should be asked, as: \"Once the metaphorical mat is rolled out, the wairua fl ows. \" (Non-Pasifi ka Th erapist)26Th e focus of questioning should not be directed so much towards the presenting problems, but at 'what sustains you' , which leads towards conversations of hope. If working with children or adolescents, it is respectful to seek permission from the parents to see the child or young person alone or at school. Sometimes the child may not speak in the presence of their parents. Confidentiality Th e mat will be a safe space, where confi dentiality and professionalism is guaranteed in the best interests of the person and their family. Pasifi ka communities are relatively small and closely connected. Th erefore, reassuring the service user that confi dentiality will be upheld is paramount. Stigma and shame associated with mental illness continues to exist amongst Pasifi ka communities and there may be signifi cant concern that information will be disclosed. Taking the time to ensure issues related to confi dentiality are explained thoroughly and to stress that privacy covers all employees of the service can be invaluable. Also being very specifi c about who the information will and will not be shared with without the person's consent can be reassuring to the family. Th e limits of confi dentiality should also be discussed and checked for understanding. The 'uplifting' process Pasifi ka communities are proud and may view involvement with mental health and addiction services with a sense of shame. Stigma and shame have been identifi ed as likely contributing factors towards Pasifi ka peoples presenting late to mental health and addiction services. Th erefore, it is crucial that the point of engagement must ignite hope that this will be a place of uplift ing, of hope and of healing. \"When a mental health service is involved with the family, they are most likely already looking down on themselves. \" (Pasifi ka Th erapist) Issues related to prior experiences with other services may exist, which can cause the person to be extremely anxious when joining the therapist on the mat. Th erefore, a warm and inviting greeting opens the door for a meaningful relationship. Even a simple gesture, such as a smile, can set the scene for a positive connection. Attempting to greet people in their own language can be viewed as a very small but signifi cant off ering to the family. Validating the person's suff ering, and praising their courage and strength in seeking help can also assist with rapport building. \"Praising the family or person, I normally say something about the house, it feels peaceful, this sets the order for discussion. \" (Pasifi ka Th erapist) Self-disclosure - 'a sharing of life stories' Th ere is a sense of family and hospitality, and a welcoming manner in which Pasifi ka peoples conduct themselves. Th e concept of 'professional distance' is foreign to many Pasifi ka therapists and consequently, they walk a fi ne line between giving of themselves in the therapeutic process - being genuine which involves openness and honesty - and knowing when boundaries are being crossed in a cultural context. Making connections through ancestral links, family, village and church can be eff ective in terms of relational connections. However, it may also act as a barrier for people not wanting to be identifi ed in their social context. Maintaining engagement with Pasifi ka youth can be diffi cult if the young person is aware the therapist has ties with their family members. 27\"If you can't join with them without any signifi cance, nothing signifi cant will happen - it will have happened by chance. \" (Non-Pasifi ka Th erapist) Language \"Like skillful orators who talk all around us - we have to talk around it (mental illness). \" (Pasifi ka Th erapist) Doing the utmost to maintain respectful relationships is valued in Pasifi ka cultures. Pasifi ka service users will oft en present as humble - listening and appearing to agree with what is being discussed, while all the time they may be suff ering and not feeling they can be truthful. Encouraging and empowering language, and presenting yourself in a way that invites service users to share is essential for meaningful connections. Th e therapist needs to quickly establish that he or she comes with a serving heart, with humility and a commitment to duty of care. Th e person must feel that the therapist will do their best for them while they are on the therapist's mat, in their vaka/va'a . Communication is always diffi cult when speaking diff erent languages. When working in the mental health and addiction sector, the challenge is associated with translating and ensuring that concepts are interpreted correctly. Consequently, misinterpretations and cultural misunderstandings can occur when engaging with Pasifi ka peoples who come from cultures unfamiliar with psychiatric terminology. While the majority of Pasifi ka peoples speak English, their comprehension can be limited. It will be helpful to check for correct understanding of meanings, and enlist the assistance of professional interpreters if a cultural advisor is not available. Th ere is still limited knowledge and understanding about Western concepts of psychological disturbances among Pasifi ka communities. While people who experience psychotic symptoms eventually come to the attention of mental health services, there is generally a limited understanding about stress, depression and anxiety, or what psychological interventions are available to help. Th erefore a therapist who states that they are from a mental health or addiction service may cause confusion or avoidance from families. Th erapists working with Pasifi ka families need to strike a respectful balance between being clear about the purpose of the referral, while avoiding describing the service in a way that may result in the family not engaging with the service. For example, some therapists tend to avoid the term 'mental illness' or 'mental health service' , particularly during the initial stages of engagement. By reframing in terms of health and well-being, or describing what the service does (for example, helping with struggles or diffi culties) and referring to behaviours and symptoms, a greater acceptance from the family may be elicited. Th e Real Skills Plus Seitapu framework recommends: Every person working with Pacifi c people has an understanding of the importance of language, both spoken and uns poken, across a variety of Pacifi c contexts, and is able to either personally apply appropriate communication techniques in working with Pacifi c people, or know exactly where such skill is available37.28The role of psycho-education While many younger, Aotearoa/New Zealand-born Pasifi ka peoples may have been exposed to mental health or addiction terms through the media, schooling and music, it may not be part of the discourse for many families who have immigrated to Aotearoa/New Zealand from the Pacifi c Islands. Th erefore, there is oft en diffi culty understanding and accepting a diagnosis of mental illness or addiction problems. Service users and their families can feel a sense of helplessness. Providing adequate education about the person's problems can help diminish some of the anxiety by de-stigmatising mental illness, providing hope, and subsequently reducing barriers to treatment. Interviews with Pasifi ka mental health service users has revealed that many of them have diffi culty explaining their illness to family members, and this can be viewed as a signifi cant hindrance to their recovery 31. An important factor in maintaining engagement with Pasifi ka peoples in mental health and addiction services is including family in the psycho-education sessions. Th is enables them to feel part of the process and gain an understanding of what their family member is experiencing. Several ways of presenting information have been identifi ed as being helpful during this stage. When explaining and presenting information related to mental illness, increased understanding can be achieved through visual representation (e.g. a whiteboard) and showing diagrammatically how various aspects are connected. Th is should include wider contextual factors. Providing written material to take home can be benefi cial, particularly for psychosis and medications, as this can be a diffi cult concept to fully comprehend. Y outh may relate to songs, art or well-known personalities when explaining the experience of mental illness. Referring to and providing information (written, videos, websites) related to Pasifi ka peoples who have experienced mental illness can assi st with de-stigmatising mental illness and provide hope for the service user and their family. Such resources can be accessed through websites and sources such as Th e Lowdown, Like Minds Like Mine and Le Va. Th erapists working in both mental health and addiction services reported the eff ectiveness of the cognitive behavioural therapy, fi ve-part model to explain psychological disturbance to Pasifi ka service users. Th e model explores fi ve diff erent aspects of a person's life - thoughts (beliefs, images, memories), moods, behaviours, physical reactions and the environment (past and present). All areas are interconnected and changes in one domain have a direct or indirect aff ect on the others.29FULL P AGE IMAGE OF OCEAN/SEA SPRAY 30Fishing for what is important - the 'round-about' or 'indirect' approach Once the relational connection has been established, and the service user and their family are willing to step into the vaka/va'a , the journey can commence. Th e therapist needs to have the confi dence and skills of navigation. It is recognised that this will involve making connections across space between the therapist and the service user, the throwing out of lines. Some of these will be lifelines, some will be missed and some w ill be picked up, but a genuine attempt to connect across space is important. Ned Cook 38 refers to the Tongan process of talanoa-po talanoa - through talking or informal conversation there is a deliberate way of being indirect. Th is involves throwing out the lines and hooks, with the skill of the therapist being to catch what is being told. Th e analogy of the Tongan fi shing practice of uku (diving) around dangerous blow-holes has been used to describe this Pasifi ka 'round-about approach'15. In certain parts of Tonga, hollows in the reef cause sea water to gush up to 30 feet into the air. Th ese are dangerous areas and yet those skilled in navigation and who have a comprehensive understanding of the terrain, are able to catch the fi sh located under the reef. Th e vaka cannot sail directly into these sites without being crushed and therefore a round-about approach is needed requiring knowledge, intuition and respect for the sea. Th is round-about approach is indicative of the ways an indirect nature of seeking information may be more eff ective when working with Pasifi ka peoples 7. Direct questioning related to self-exposure or self-assertion can be perceived by Pasifi ka families as intrusive and rude39. Th is round-about approach relies extensively on allowing the family to tell their story and may take time. It can be misperceived as 'avoidance' by a therapist who is unfamiliar with Pasifi ka ways of relating. Pasifi ka therapists generally know what they are listening to (and listening for) and can put this information into context, which enables them to assess if the presenting issues are pathological or culturally acceptable behaviours, thoughts and feelings. If a therapist doesn't have these culturally specifi c skills, things can become lost in translation. However, even a basic awareness of the fact that Pasifi ka peoples may choose to tell stories in an indirect manner may be helpful for non-Pasifi ka therapists. During the therapeutic journey, disclosure of personal and oft en distressing information may be made. A respectful and culturally competent therapist, skilled in the 'round-about' approach and who uses metaphors and story-telling, can provide a safe environment for this to occur. Judy Matai'a 40 introduces a Samoan mode of 'cultural communication' that incorporates inferences and narrative metaphors as an eff ective practice tool for addressing unspeakable taboos such as sexual abuse. She refers to the mating rituals of the laumei (turtle) who aft er the mating season and birth of its off spring, returns to mate with its own. Although she has not named the act of incestuous relations, the content and meaning behind the laumei metaphor does not leave scope for misunderstanding. Makasiale41 also employs heliaki (metaphor) and an indirect approach when working therapeutically with service users. In a counselling session with a young Pasifi ka woman, Makasiale reveals how she includes metaphor when navigating sensitive issues. When she talks about the rain pouring within the person it elicits an emotional response from the young women who then feels able to tell her story. 31For people, counsellor and client, who are not well known to each other - this use of metaphor is a strategy that avoids a possible humiliating route to shut-down. Makasiale draws on her own cultural knowledge and wisdom, avoiding direct language and therefore skilfully avoiding loss of face, 'no room to move' and a violation of the va between people who are not known to each other. Her choice of heliaki leaves the unspeakable unsaid, but opens up the possibilities of hearing and speaking 'truth' 42. involving families Th e Real Skills Plus Seitapu framework outlines considerations for the mental health and addiction workforce when working with Pasifi ka populations. One of the key themes of this document relates to engaging with Pasifi ka families. Th e following information aligns and supports this framework. Th e collective nature of Pasifi ka communities suggests that when working with Pasifi ka service users, the recovery journey is most likely to involve their families (including extended family members) and possibly others in the community (e.g. church ministers, traditional healers). If working with an individual alone, assessing the quality of the relationships the service user has with the extended family and community can provide crucial information in trying to understand their presenting life struggles 43. While recognising the importance of engaging families in the recovery journey of the service user, it is also important to acknowledge the constraints of bringing the family together. For example, work commitments may prevent family members from attending appointments. As mentioned previously, non-attendance should not be perceived as a lack of interest or caring. Additionally, while family involvement is desirable, it may not necessarily be appropriate in all circumstances. Pacifi c opinion leaders argue that service workers need to ensure that blanket assumptions or stereotypes are not unfairly adopted (pg x) 7. Th erefore, engaging the family does not necessarily require bringing them into the service, but it is important that they feel valued and are at least off ered a home visit to ensure that the service user, particularly if they are a young person, remains engaged with the service. Having a cultural advisor or matua present, or available to consult with, can ensure cultural values are respected and that the family is treated appropriately and fairly. Many ethnic minority families, including Pasifi ka families, experience diffi culties when immigrating to another country 44. Th ey describe how the impact of immigration and cultural adjustment can be extremely stressful for some families, as they face not just physical, economical and language transitions, but also cognitive and psychological transitions. Confl ict and emotional distance can arise, as children of immigrants discover freedom of choice and learn assertiveness. As a consequence, depression, anxiety, family violence and suicide may occur. Th e therapist can be helpful in engaging families in what is referred to as 'externalising conversations' where the family provides accounts of the eff ects of migration which externalises the problem and does not place it within the individual or family 45. Fono participants identifi ed this narrative technique of externalising the problem as a respectful and eff ective approach when working with Pasifi ka families. Externalising the problem is consistent 32with choosing to be indirect and not personalising the problem, or locating it exclusively within the person. It is important to consider all the tensions, confl icts and fears that service users and their families may be facing when involved with a mental health or addiction service. Th is may be the fear of the therapeutic journey itself and what it may uncover and where it may lead. Th ese pre-therapy suggestions may assist the therapist to help the service user and their family reach a point where they are willing to get into the vaka/va'a and embark on a therapeutic journey. medication Psychotropic medications (i.e. those that aff ect mental activity, behaviour or perception) are usually off ered to Pasifi ka people either by their general practitioner or by a psychiatrist in mental health and addiction services. Such medications may be tranquilisers, sedatives, antidepressants or antipsychotics. Traditionally, herbs are used throughout the Pacifi c for medicinal purposes to address a range of illnesses. Usually, use of these herbs has a prescribed time limit. A psychiatrist commented that he oft en used this fact to explain the purpose and usefulness of psychotropic medications, as it provided a familiar and useful framewor k from which families to make decisions about medications. Giving families diff erent options for medications and using motivational interviewing and solution-focussed techniques could increase the likelihood of people being willing to trial medication 46. Th e use of western medications in the Pacifi c Islands may impact on the decision to trial medications. Th ere is a limited choice available in many Pacifi c nations and dosages can consequently be at non- therapeutic levels, limiting eff ectiveness. Th e concepts of maintenance medication or preventative medication may be unfamiliar. Th ese factors can contribute to medication compliance issues. Pasifi ka service users may report that they are compliant with medication when they are not. Th ey may stop using medication when they start to feel better and may not understand the importance of continuing or tapering off medications. Most Pasifi ka service users who experience psychotic symptoms and who are seen by mental health and addiction services will be prescribed either oral or depo medications. Intervening at the earliest stage is important and this may mean starting talking therapies sooner. If service users are on medication, then they should be maintain ed on the lowest dose possible. Signifi cant side eff ects can lead to further non-compliance. Maintaining the therapeutic relationship is still important, even in the context of administering medication. \"You can never divorce the importance of the the rapeutic relationship even when trying to get the person to take the depo every week. \" (Non-Pasifi ka Th erapist) Consideration should also be given to the power dynamics that may occur, as oft en a doctor is looked upon as an expert. Th ere may be a tendency to 'overpower' , as opposed to 'empower' , service users to make fully informed decisions. 33 34It is important to ensure that the family understands how medication can be useful. In child, adolescent and family mental health services, families can be more reluctant for young people to take medication. Medication should be expla ined in a way that families and the service user understand. Th is may also mean working alongside traditional healers. Explaining the way medications work, the side eff ects and dosages are important. Th is could be provided using diagrams on a white board or with paper and pen. Handouts should also be provided. Explaining a trial of medication and when it will be reviewed is also important. let's get real Let's get real is a framework that was established to increase the eff ective delivery of mental health and addiction treatment services throughout Aotearoa/New Zealand. Th is framework describes the essential knowledge and skills required by people who work in mental health and addiction services. Th e essential values and attitudes that underpin the framework are also expressed throughout this document. Th e Real Skills Plus Seitapu framework is a companion document to the Let's get real framework and presents the essential and desirable knowledge, skills and attitudes required by the mental health and addiction workforce in order to work more eff ectively with Pasifi ka peoples and their families. Th e skills are considered to be fl uid and transitional with the key themes being family, language and tapu . Much of the knowledge, skills and attitudes identifi ed in this guide align and support the principles identifi ed in Let's get real and Real Skills Plus Seitapu. traditional perspectives on mental health and healing Attributions for mental un-wellness may vary from an aetiology of an injury, to being possessed by spirits, or to breaches of tapu - the sacred bonds between people16. Intergenerational curses may also be named as causative factors. Th ese causes can disturb the natural harmony of relationships or be viewed as spiritual issues that may manifes t in a mental illness. Similar to other indigenous cultures, the use of traditional therapies or healers is a practice that is used among many Pasifi ka peoples to ameliorate these causes. Th ere are many diff erent traditional methods available to families when they are facing diffi culties with a family member. Th ese include particular processes or rituals used by traditional healers who are especially gift ed with particular presentations. Th ese gift s are seen as tapu43 and they can ameliorate or heal the sources of disharmony. Traditional therapies can include fofo (massage), herbal remedies prepared in a traditional way, or in cantations and prayers by a traditional healer. Christian ministers are also used to help restore harmony. Stressors that contribute to mental un-wellness from a Samoan perspective include low income, unemployment and the marginalisation of Samoan cultural norms in Aotearoa/New Zealand. Pasifi ka peoples tend to be over-represtented in low socio-economic status populations and have fi nancial collective cultural obligations such as weddings and funerals. Many also experience cultural adjustment issues, which can include raci al prejudices. Continual adjustment to dominant cultural norms is also seen as contributing to destabilising relational harmony and the deterioration of mental health 16. 35It is useful to include folk-healers in psychiatric treatment as this provides a meaningful collaboration for service users suff ering from avanga (disease)47. If mental un-wellness is attributable to breaches of tapu , western medicine may be seen as insuffi cient intervention16 and traditional healing will be required. Appropriate cultural services for mental health have been proposed that will address these factors more eff ectively. While Pasifi ka peoples may consult traditional healers for mental health issues in preference to western psychiatric treatment, concerns have been raised about the problems arising from delays in receiving eff ective mental health treatment and the impact on the long-term prognosis for individuals. However, there is no evidence to prove these concerns are valid. Tapu is a key skill identifi ed by the Real Skills Plus Seitapu framework. It states that every mental health worker needs to be open minded to the cultural, spiritual and relationship environments and belief systems that may accompany Pasifi ka service users and their families. Th is skill can be demonstrated in a number of ways, such as acknowledging the belief that mental illness may be a result of a breach of tapu , and that this breach may be trans-generational, or by recognising that the concept of tapu is about ensuring cultural safety and enabling culturally safe practices.36THE THERAPIES Te Pou has published a series of guides, which are intended to inform staff working therapeutically with specifi c population groups about the processes of engagement and therapies that are particularly appropriate. In addition, A Guide to Talking Th erapies in New Zealand (www.tepou.co.nz ), may be useful as a general source of information on therapies that are widely used throughout Aotearoa/New Zealand and how to access them. However, there is limited documented research on the eff ectiveness of talking therapies with Pasifi ka populations5. Consequently, data gathered to inform this section is based on anecdotal evidence and practice-based observations from both Pasifi ka and non-Pasifi ka therapists who are providing therapy for Pasifi ka peoples accessing mental health and addiction services in Aotearoa/ New Zealand. Focus groups were also held in Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch, and key informant interviews were held with key stakeholders in the mental health and addiction sector. talanoa Talanoa is a concept familiar to Samoa, Tonga and Fiji. It simply means talking or having a conversation48. T ala means inform, relate, story or tale, or command and noa translates as nothing, ordinary or void. Despite the literal meaning of 'talking about nothing' , Talanoa is widely used to cover anything from general through to more meaningful conversations at many diff erent levels. Talanoa is an oral tradition where ceremony and protocol is as important as the actual process of relating49. Talanoa is non-linear, usually carried out face to face and is reciprocal without time restriction. Th e values of Talanoa , where the relationship between people is privileged, and fl exibility and adaptation occurs naturally, lends itself to Westernised ideas of therapeutic conversations. \" Talanoa is a good conversation: one listens to the other\"48. It has also been proposed as an appropriate research methodology for Pasifi ka peoples, especially for social and education purposes. Talanoa does not have a preconceived agenda and it is not about consensus50. While the outcome is not predetermined, if you have faith and \"respect and trust the people you are talking with, you will get the outcome\" . However, the critical factor involved in the Talanoa process relates to eff ective facilitation and being able to extract and refl ect back the important points. Ultimately, Talanoa is based on a respectful and trusting relationship. Accordingly, therapy cannot be seen in isolation, but is an extension of relationship building. Once the metaphorical mat has been rolled out and the relationship has been established, it is time to journey in the vaka/va'a . Once the relational connection has been made and the service user and their family is willing to step into the vaka/va'a , the therapy (or fi shing journey) can commence. Th ere are times that this journey may lead to unexpected horizons and times when the journey experiences whirlpools and there is danger of the vaka/va'a capsizing. Western types of interventions help to focus inwards and fi nd answers within yourself. It was suggested by fono participants that many Pasifi ka peoples tend to process outwards, focusing on relationships. However, like every other ethnic group, there is a wide variety of responses and individual diversity. It was also reported that Pasifi ka service users may prefer practical solutions and strategies. 37Th erapy oft en has its challenges and progress can either be slower or quicker than anticipated. Perhaps what is important for therapists to consider is that there are many cultural maps that can be applied to the same terrain. Be aware that a Pasifi ka person may see the same territory very diff erently. Th erefore, there may be cultural nuances, signposts and markers that do not appear on the therapist's map. Th is means that alongside the frameworks and tools that have been part of a therapist's training, there is a need to be trained to see what is not on their own map. Ultimately, the service user must be able to map their own way in recovery. Th is cannot be super- imposed upon them. Th e therapist is not the captain of the therapeutic journey, but merely one of many guides. Pausing to try and see what is there (particularly with regard to cultural nuances and issues) that does not feature on the clinical map, yet exists for the person, is an important skill. narrative approaches Th ere is no empirical evidence for using narrative approaches with Pasifi ka peoples in mental health and addiction services, yet they are utilised extensively. Narrative approaches historically developed as a response to behaviourism and cognitive approaches, as they were believed to be more respectful of cultural diff erences. Narrative approaches were also seen as more useful in terms of externalising diffi culties and for re-storying or constructing alternative realities51. Using storytelling is a familiar cultural practice across the Pacifi c. Th ere is also an acceptance in narrative approaches of meanings and signifi cant events as opposed to a linear or logical time frame. Hence, these approaches appear more eff ective in exploring these events, rather than relying on the semantic meanings of words. Th is approach builds on the service user's strengths and helps them to re-story their struggles into a strengths-based narrative. Th is approach shares similarities with the process of talanoa and may fi t well with both island-born and New Zealand- born Pasifi ka peoples. Adult mental health services Narrative therapy was being used by therapists who saw it as a useful way of working with their Pasifi ka service users to support re-authoring of stories and build collaboration with service users. Th e non-linear approach of narrative therapy and its fi t with the use of storytelling was seen as particularly eff ective. \"Narrative approach - sometimes not as linear as palangi process - [one] can talk about [an] incident as if in the present but [it] actually happened 20 years ago -[there is] more about the signifi cance of the event as opposed to logical time frame as we know it - [this] goes back to knowing [the] nuances of culture. \" (Pasifi ka Th erapist) Child, adolescent and fa mily mental health services Sharing stories is seen as a Pasifi ka way in which families can connect and is suitable for relating to young people as it is a medium familiar to them. Th eir use in externalising diffi culties is useful, rather than diffi culties being seen as a problem with the person. \"Sharing and telling stories is a very Pasifi ka way - families can connect with you and kids can relate. \" (Pasifi ka Th erapist)38Th e personal stories co-constructed were understood as heart connections as opposed to intellectual ones. Narrative family therapy appears to be useful in the child and adolescent mental health setting. Narrative approaches also appear to be eff ective when talking to parents. Th is included identifying strengths through others, as a person may not talk about themselves as culturally this may be considered inappropriate. An example of this may be asking a young person about their strengths in a culturally appropriate way like, \"What would your grandmother have been proud of about you?\" Narrative family therapy (is) most eff ective, relational, spiritual, most respectful of cultures. A manualised approach [in contrast] - does not address relational aspect system, or context adequately. (Pasifi ka Th erapist) Addiction services Narrative approaches do not appear to be used by therapists from addiction services surveyed in the fono . motivational interviewing Th ere is no empirical evidence for this approach with Pasifi ka peoples in mental health and addiction services, yet is widely used. Motivational interviewing (MI) is a therapeutic technique that has been shown to be useful in helping to engage people in changing their behaviour52. MI is brief and client-centred. It uses four key principles: express sympathy, develop discrepancy, roll with resistance and support self-effi cacy. Th e emphasis is not to challenge people directly, but to help them see other alternatives. It also appears to be a useful technique for both engagement and working therapeutically, as it accommodates Pasifi ka service users at all levels of behaviour change. It has been used for joining with Pasifi ka service users and drawing on their motivation for change. It is also used for helping people with their medication compliance. MI is seen as useful for both adult and adolescent age groups. Adult mental health settings MI is particularly useful when assessing service users. Oft en Pasifi ka peoples do not like being confronted directly and using MI can be helpful. It also helps engage the service user in their reasons for change. Child, adolescent and fa mily mental health services MI does not appear to be used in this area, according to those surveyed, but it may be useful to engage young people for the reasons already outlined. Addiction services MI is used extensively within addiction services according to the therapists surveyed in the fono . It is used to help service users work out if they have a problem issue to deal with. Th e framework provides an opportunity to discuss the impact of issues on a person's family and lifestyle. 39Full page photo image OF CANOE/W AKA 40Th is in turn can greatly aid motivation to change and also move people from a pre-contemplative to contemplative stance, and then into action. Th is appears to be particularly useful in changing health behaviours when service users are given some psycho-education and an opportunity to refl ect on how they can make changes themselves with the support of a therapist. solution-focussed brief therapy Th ere is no empirical evidence for using this approach with Pasifi ka peoples in mental health and addiction services, yet is widely used. Solution focussed brief therapy (SFBT) is a therapeutic strengths-based intervention53. It moves a service user from a problem-dominated perspective to a solution-oriented perspective. Th is model fi ts well with talanoa , to \"ask people to generate their own solutions\" . It also fi ts well with using a service user's own knowledge about themselves and their context, and is a strengths-based perspective, rather than one of pathology. SFBT was used by many therapists for a variety of issues, particularly to support engagement. Th e emphasis on 'brief ' intervention should be considered in light of engagement issues. Th is is due to the period that needs to be taken to build engagement with Pasifi ka clients. However, this approach may also fi t with a service user's time constraints, such as the identifi ed barrier to therapy of needing to take time off work to attend appointments. Adult mental health services SFBT did not appear to be used by therapists from addiction services surveyed in the fono . Child, adolescent and fa mily mental health services SFBT appears useful for young people in that it focuses on fi nding solutions rather than being problem focussed. Identity and connections for young people are especially important in this developmental stage, so being solution-focussed may appeal more to them. \"For young people talking about identity - we look at maps, who am I? Where do I belong? Not focus on me and my problems but where I am in the world and get grounded/rooted (so) they can do lots of things. [It is important to have a] holistic approach to understanding the person in the context in which they operate. \" (Pasifi ka Th erapist) Addiction services Some of the therapists from the fono used SFBT with their Pasifi ka service users and reported how useful it had been for service users. Th e 'Miracle Question' (e.g. What would be diff erent if you woke up tomorrow and the issue you are dealing with is gone?) had been particularly poignant for service users. It appears that this helps with motivation to change and provides hope that things can be diff erent for them and their families. cognitive behaviour therapy Th ere is no empirical evidence for this approach with Pasifi ka people in mental health and addiction services, yet it is utilised to some extent by those trained in it.41Cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) is a therapy that is oft en favoured because of the substantial evidence base of its usefulness for a range of me ntal health issues. CBT assists people to monitor their thoughts, increase behavioural activation, and challenge erroneous thinking and core beliefs by looking for evidence. While there is no current Pasifi ka-specifi c research to support this, feedback from both Pasifi ka and non-Pasifi ka therapists suggests CBT can be an eff ective therapeutic intervention. However, there were conditions associated with its application. A strict adherence or a rigid CBT approach was reported to be not well received by Pasifi ka service users. In particular, those who are more traditional need a more fl exible therapy. However, for New Zealand-born Pasifi ka children, youth and adults who are more acculturated into Aotearoa/New Zealand society, CBT with some cultural adaptations was said to have produced positive therapeutic outcomes. Th e acknowledgement or inclusion of the spiritual component was helpful in presenting this model to Pasifi ka service users. It was also reported that the fi ve-part model in its written form was useful. When applying problem solving, particular considerations for therapists included being mindful of the context and how solutions may impact on family and community relationships, as well as being mindful of cultural consequences. CBT is regarded as eff ective for anxiety-related presentations and depression, which have been identifi ed as the most common mental health issues for Pasifi ka peoples 1. However, it appears that the therapist's level of experience and training in applying this approach, as well as their cultural knowledge and competence, are important factors in the success of this model. It is unclear if Pasifi ka and non-Pasifi ka therapists diff er in their delivery of CBT and this could be investigated in future research. Adult mental health services One Pasifi ka therapist commented that CBT was more useful when it started with examples then presented concepts and said, \"Pasifi ka (people) don't usually think from concept to example but build concepts from the ground up\" . Some Pasifi ka therapists discussed the importance of addressing the 'B' in CBT, or the behavioural component, as this was a familiar concept and more tangible. It was recommended that, if using a CBT approa ch, commencing with behavioural activation would fi t with the way that people who were not well would be supported in the Pacifi c Islands. Th at is, they would still be given achievable tasks to complete as part of their family. Th ese tasks were seen to help build confi dence and achievement and give them a useful role, even if it was a small practical task like raking the leaves. It was also suggested that: \"CBT needs to be turned upside down - look at historical and current narratives through story telling fi rst then introduce CBT concepts - then the client has something to hang concepts on - practical life examples. \" (Pasifi ka Th erapist) Th e feedback from therapists interviewed for this guide suggests that CBT is useful when working with Pasifi ka adults. It is seen as useful for relapse prevention and maintaining wellness. It has also 42been identifi ed as a collaborative approach where time is taken to build a therapeutic relationship. It is useful to help service users monitor their thoughts for early warning signs. Child, adolescent and fa mily mental health services Some Pasifi ka therapists used CBT with young Pasifi ka people, with all elements of the therapy employed. Th ese service users did tend to be Aotearoa/New Zealand-born young people. Using the whiteboard to draw diagrams when explaining the principles and the model and providing written materials supplemented therapy. Homework appeared useful to reinforce the concepts learnt and discussed in therapy. Th e ABC's of CBT for young people were deemed useful, especially around consequences, as these seemed to provide tangible factors that young people could relate to. Addiction services CBT was not used routinely in addiction services. However, many therapists highlighted the eff ectiveness of using the CBT fi ve-part model when providing psycho-education to the service users and their families. Service users are provided with a visual framework and can make their own connections with the material. dialectic behaviour therapy Th ere is no empirical evidence for this approach with Pasifi ka peoples in mental health and addiction services and was utilised by a few therapists with Pasifi ka peoples. Dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT) is an evidence-based approach originally formulated by Linehan for working with women with a di agnosis of borderline personality disorder54. Its use has extended to work with adolescents and in the justice sector with off ending behaviours. Pasifi ka peoples oft en do not access a DBT programme, due to the limited availability of DBT and the commitment required on behalf of the service user. Th e few therapists who used some of this therapy primarily employed it to teach DBT skills, such as practical Mindfulness activities, that are useful for Pasifi ka service users. Adult mental health services Th erapists surveyed were not using DBT. However, DBT is available in various forms in adult mental health services. To date, DBT has not been modifi ed for Pasifi ka service users. Child, adolescent and fa mily mental health services DBT appears promising for groups in which the majority of members are of Pasifi ka descent and where the therapy is being delivered by an experienced Pasifi ka therapist. Th e reasons for its success may be attributed to the cultural matching of the therapist and the group. DBT's delivery was highlighted as useful when engaging Pasifi ka youth, as it takes an active learning approach that incorporates practical everyday life events that youth can relate and connect with. As with other groups, it would be important to have at least one other youth of Pasifi ka descent in a DBT group. 43Addiction services Th is approach was not being used by therapists from addictions services surveyed. However, aspects of mindfulness (which is a key concept of DBT) were being used successfully with Pasifi ka service users. family therapy Th ere is no empirical evidence for this approach with Pasifi ka peoples in mental health and addiction services. Family therapy is an approach that includes the family of an identifi ed service user. Formal family therapy was used cautiously by the therapists surveyed. In some cases family therapy can be hard to implement because of the va or sacred relationships between generations, especially between father and daughter, and brother and sister. Th e intricacies that exist in relationships between Pasifi ka peoples are extremely important and should be treated with caution. An example of this is mehikitanga , or the role and status that an elder sister or cousin has over her brother's children in Tongan culture 43. Th is can be easily misinterpreted as an unhealthy alliance in structural family therapy. It is imperative that any family therapy be done with an awareness of these issues. Adult mental health services Family work or sessions can be useful in a recovery framework. Th is is not family therapy per se. A consumer advocate reported that it was only when he felt his cultural practices were taken into account and respected by the therapist he was seen by, that he asked his family to be involved in his treatment. While the inclusion of family members is ideal in intervention and recovery, the reality of family members having transport and the time during offi ce hours to attend appointments can be diffi cult and can place more stress on a family system. Careful consideration can help identify and work around these issues. Child, adolescent and fa mily mental health services While the family is very important in a young person's presentation, traditional family therapies may not always be suitable. Asking a Pasifi ka young person to comment on a family member who is older is problematic for a number of reasons. Th is may include the relationship boundaries that exist, as commenting on how a parent or other family member may see a situation can transgress these boundary 14. Addiction services Family therapy was not used routinely in this sector by those interviewed.45other therapeutic techniques Socratic questioning Aspects of therapies like Socratic questioning were identifi ed as useful to help Pasifi ka service users identify what their issues were. Socratic questioning is important and if you're doing it well you'll be getting to the core issues, self statements about the person. I don't think there are exclusive ways of doing it. Th e best therapists in probably any mode of therapy will get to it in their own way 55. Socratic questioning is seen as more useful than direct questioning in both assessment and therapy. A risk of using more direct questions is that they may elicit responses from the service user that indicate agreement with professionals, when actually they do not agree. Both Pasifi ka-born and Aotearoa/New Zealand-born service users are unli kely to challenge the therapist in order to remain respectful. Humour Humour is important to use in the therapeutic relationship at appropriate times, as it can provide some temporary relief 56 and help to avoid the service user leaving the appointment feeling worse. However, when and what you can laugh about is important. Th erefore non-Pasifi ka therapists should be cautious using humour, as it is easy to off end if they are unaware of cultural nuances. Physical interventions Adjunctive physical interventions can enhance talking therapies. Y oung people can feel uncomfortable with face-to-face, one-to-one talking. Boys tend to be more active. Th erefore using incentives such as a game of touch rugby at the end of a talking session may help them remain focused. Other ideas that were discussed included gardening, weaving, umu (traditional cooking method) and having conversations while working. Th ese are all natural activities for Pasifi ka peoples that could be extended to a group therapy context. Relaxation, prayer, meditation, breathing and music were also identifi ed as useful to incorporate into therapy. Concretisation 'Concretisation' or using items that represent something meaningful (e.g. sand-tray objects and photos) was identifi ed as a useful technique for therapists. One therapist used 'the empty chair' technique as a way of externalising - by talking to an imagined person sitting on an empty chair as though they were present. Pasifi ka people can be very visual so using visual aids, such as photos, pictures, artefacts, diagrams and the whiteboard, can be useful. Using resources that are culturally connecting and that service users can relate to and identify with can also aid therapy. Symbols can also be used, such as mats and the kava bowl where water symbolises cleansing. Th ese aesthetics are seen as important 57. Group therapy Groups were mentioned throughout the fono as an appropriate way to deliver therapy, but certain factors must be considered. Groups appeared useful if there was more than one Pasifi ka service user in the group. If a Pasifi ka person attends a mainstream group, a Pasifi ka therapist advised that 46non-Pasifi ka therapists should be aware that it could take time for them to open up and trust the group, and not to expect they will open up straight away. Th e principles in section two of this guide on engagement would still apply. Other issues such as ethnic matching, or variables such as gender and age may also need consideration for group therapy. One reason for this is the appropriateness of discussing issues with people of the same gender, so as not to breach tapu 7. less widely available evidence-based therapies Acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) Th ere is no empirical evidence for this approach with Pasifi ka peoples in mental health and addiction services, but it shows potential as a promising therapy. Acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) has only recently been introduced into Aotearoa/ New Zealand as a therapeutic approach, and therefore the number of therapists skilled in this approach is not as extensive as those trained in more established therapies. Consequently, it is diffi cult to comment on ACT's eff ectiveness with Pasifi ka populations. However, ACT's inclusion of metaphors and values, and its focus and emphasis on life domains that are important to Pasifi ka peoples (e.g. spirituality, community, recreation, family, work or career, parenting, friends and social life, education, physical well-being and relationships) would suggest this approach could have potential appeal and usefulness for Pasifi ka populations. Bibliotherapy Th ere is no empirical evidence for using this approach with Pasifi ka peoples in mental health and addiction services. Given possible language diffi culties, and a preference by many Pasifi ka peoples for face-to-face engagement, while this approach may be a useful adjunct to talking therapies for those service users who are competent in the English language, it is not recommended as a stand-alone intervention. However, it may be an option for Pasifi ka peoples experiencing mild mental health or addiction problems who are reluctant to engage with mental health or addiction services because of stigma. Computerised cognitive behaviour therapy Th ere is no empirical evidence for using this approach with Pasifi ka peoples in mental health and addiction services. Given the importance of relationships for Pasifi ka people, this approach may be useful to complement talking therapy, but at this stage would not be recommended as a stand-alone intervention. It may also be more useful for Pasifi ka people who have access to computers and the internet and who are more technology literate. Counselling Th ere is no empirical evidence for using this approach with Pasifi ka peoples in mental health and addiction services. 47Interpersonal psychotherapy Th ere is no empirical evidence for this using approach with Pasifi ka peoples in mental health and addiction services. No therapists interviewed for this project identifi ed this approach as one they used with Pasifi ka service users. Multisystemic therapy Th ere is no empirical evidence for using this approach with Pasifi ka peoples in mental health and addiction services. No therapists interviewed for this project identifi ed this approach as one that they used with Pasifi ka service users. Problem-solving therapy Th ere is no empirical evidence for using this approach with Pasifi ka people in mental health and addiction services. No therapists interviewed for this project identifi ed this approach as one that they used on its own with Pasifi ka service users. However, it is used as a technique within other therapeutic approaches, such as CBT. Psychodynamic therapy Th ere is no empirical evidence for using this approach with Pasifi ka people in mental health and addiction services. No therapists interviewed for this project identifi ed this approach as one that they used with Pasifi ka service users. Psychotherapy with children Th is is addressed within each of the models under the Child, Adolescent and Family Mental Health Services sub-heading. conclusion Talking therapies Th erapies currently being used most successfully with Pasifi ka service users include those that encourage a strengths-based approach. A recovery focus is also important and this sometimes includes the use of medication. Recognising and atten ding to a holistic model is also important for therapists working with Pasifi ka service users. While all the therapists interviewed believed that the mentioned talking therapy models were useful, they strongly identifi ed that in their practice they modifi ed, adapted or used parts of these models eclectically. It appears that having several models to draw on as a therapist helps to meet service users' needs more holistically. Th e therapists interviewed were more senior practitioners and although they knew the therapeutic underpinnings of each model, would not exclusively use one with Pasifi ka peoples. Th ey also did not believe that 'manualised'-type approaches were fl exible enough to address Pasifi ka people's holistic needs. Hence, it appears that a high level of sophistication, confi dence and competence is necessary when working with Pasifi ka people. Th is is consistent with ideas proposed in We Need to Act 5, with those service users presenting in secondary mental health services needing comprehensive service, including a range of therapeutic modalities.48Full page photo image - sunrise? 49RESOURCES www.tepou.co.nz www.leva.co.nz Other helpful websites www.104.6planetfm.org.nz Planet FM - giving a voice to those with mental illness, disabilities, of diff erent sexuality, beliefs, culture and language, or supporting the desires of many to build community, based on meaningful and relevant communication. www.depression.org.nz Th e National Depression Initiative (NDI) aims to reduce the impact of depression on the lives of New Zealanders, by aiding early recognition, appropriate treatment, and recovery. www.familiescommission.govt.nz Th e Families Commission provides a voice for New Zealand families and whnau.
