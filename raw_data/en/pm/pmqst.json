The incidence of obesity has greatly increased in recent years owing to the consumption of processed foods and a high-fat diet, and this pattern is expected to increase over time. Hence, the use of Western medicine commonly used to treat obesity-related diseases is also increasing, as are the health risks among patients [ [2](#B2)]. Alternative therapies such as Korean traditional medicine, which makes use of potent secondary metabolites from plants, is one of the oldest forms of treatment known to mankind [ [3](#B3)]. Bioactive components isolated from diverse plants have provided a significant source of medicinal agents and abundant nutrients since ancient times [ [4](#B4)]. Furthermore, the type of plant is important for the investigation of pharmacological properties because plants have different abilities to accumulate secondary metabolites [ [5](#B5)]. [6](#B6)]. Areca catechu is one of the known fruit plants of the Palmaceae family [ [7](#B7)]. It has been used for a long time as a source of herbal medicine to treat dysentery or dysuria in Indonesia. While the Areca catechu nut has been actively studied for its pharmacological properties, including anti-inflammatory effects, there is a lack of studies on the effect of Areca catechu leaves and the underlying molecular mechanism. [8](#B8)]. Therefore, most chronic diseases, including vascular diseases, arthritis, cancer, and type II diabetes, involve inflammatory reactions [ [9](#B9)]. Claria et al. reported that macrophages contributed to adipose tissue inflammation and phenotypic changes caused by obesity [ [10](#B10)]. Inflammation is a complicated process, which is regulated by transcription factors, pro-inflammatory cytokines, adhesion enzymes, and other mediators (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) can result in excessive NO production [ [13](#B13)]. These enzymes are regulated by the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-B) transcription factor, which is activated and translocates to the nucleus in response to inflammatory stimuli [ [14](#B14)]. LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells and carrageenan-induced inflammation are widely used as chronic and acute inflammation models [ [15](#B15)]. There is evidence that the immune response underlies the induction of iNOS and COX-2 [ [16](#B16)]. Therefore, herbal medicines may act as anti-inflammatory agents by suppressing mediators such as NF-B, iNOS, and COX-2. MATERIALS AND METHODS Chemicals Plant material and preparation of ethanol extract Cell culture and cell viability Determination of NO production Western blot analysis Animals care and in vivo studies [17](#B17)] 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 h after carrageenan injection. The increase in paw volume (% of control) was calculated based on the difference between the control and test groups. RESULTS Effect of ACE on NO production in LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells [Fig. 1A](#F1)). Next, to test the effect of ACE on NO production in LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells, we measured nitrate levels by using the Griess reagent assay. LPS-containing DMEM (1 \u00b5g/ml) 24 h. As shown in [Fig. 1B](#F1), ACE attenuated NO production at non-cytotoxic concentrations. The inhibition of LPS-induced NO levels was approximately 45%, and 50% in response to 1, and 3 \u00b5g/ml ACE, respectively. ACE regulates the NO generation pathway in LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells [Fig. 2](#F2), iNOS and COX-2 expression were induced by LPS. However, ACE treatment inhibited LPS-induced COX-2 protein expression in a dose-dependent manner ( [Fig. 2 B](#F2)). Further, treatment with 3 \u00b5g/ml ACE significantly decreased iNOS expression by approximately 20% ( [Fig. 2 C](#F2)). Therefore, the strongest inhibitory effect of ACE on iNOS and COX-2 expression occurred at a concentration of 3 \u00b5g/m1 ACE. Next, we determined the effect of ACE on NF-B signaling in response to LPS stimulation. ACE (0.3-3 \u00b5g/ml) significantly reduced NF-B expression while increasing IB levels in a dose-dependent manner ( [Fig. 2 D, E](#F2)). Effect of ACE carrageenan-induced acute inflammation in vivo [Fig. 3](#F3)). DISCUSSION [18](#B18)]. In this study, we demonstrated the inhibitory effects of ACE against inflammation in vitro and in vivo. We examined the effect of ACE on the major inflammation signaling pathways in LPS-activated RAW 264.7 macrophages. Moreover, we examined the effect of ACE in an acute inflammation model of carrageenan-induced paw edema in rats. We found that inhibition of iNOS and NF-B signaling was involved in the anti-inflammatory effect of ACE. Our results clearly demonstrate that ACE has a powerful activity against chronic and acute inflammation. [11](#B11), [14](#B14), [19](#B19)]. Macrophages are the early antagonists of pathogens in the body and play an important role during inflammation [ [20](#B20)]. Inflammatory responses in macrophages induced by LPS or carrageenan include production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and increased expression of iNOS and COX-2 [ [13](#B13)]. Therefore, we first focused on the LPS-induced NO production in the in vitro study. We found that ACE was not toxic at concentrations between 0.3 and 3 \u00b5g/ml, based on the post-treatment viability of RAW 264.7 cells; however, higher dosages, such as 10 \u00b5g/ml, were cytotoxic. In addition, we demonstrated that ACE significantly decreased NO production in LPS-induced RAW 264.7 cells. Therefore, ACE is a promising therapeutic agent against acute and chronic inflammation. [16](#B16), [21](#B21)]. The activation of iNOS in macrophages and the resulting overproduction of NO can lead to inflammation, cancer, and autoimmune diseases. Therefore, we also investigated the changes in the levels of key proteins involved in inflammation by performing immunoblot analysis. Our results indicated that ACE treatment inhibited iNOS and COX-2 expression in LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells. These results suggest that ACE inhibits the transcription of iNOS, leading to decrease NO production. [22](#B22)]. In its inactive state, NF-B is present in the cytoplasm in a complex with IB [ [23](#B23)]. Upon cell stimulation, IB is phosphorylated and dissociates from NF-B, which translocates to the nucleus and activates the transcription of inflammation-associated genes [ [24](#B24), [25](#B25), [26](#B26)]. Our results showed that treatment with 1 and 3 \u00b5g/ml ACE significantly increased IB expression, suggesting that ACE inhibited LPS-induced NF-B expression by suppressing IB phosphorylation. [24](#B24)]. Contrary to our results, Lin et al. (2005) reported that Areca nut extract, which is rich in polyphenols, induced COX-2 expression through the activation of the NF-B signal transduction pathway [ [27](#B27)]. However, Areca nut extract has also been shown to inhibit COX-2 expression [ [28](#B28)]. This difference is probably due to an active component present in Areca nuts, and not leaves, which we used in our study. [29](#B29)]. Sustained administration of ACE at 2.5-10 mg/kg/day for several days prevented carrageenan-induced inflammatory exudate formation. Our results indicated that treatment with different concentrations (2.5-10 mg/kg) of ACE decreased paw volume in the acute inflammation animal model. Treatment with a high dose (10 mg/kg) of ACE greatly decreased paw volumes and prevented further inflammation, which was consistent with the results of Barman et al. showing that treatment with Areca catechu leaves inhibited nociceptive activity in the acetic acid-induced gastric pain mouse model [ [30](#B30)]. Therefore, Areca catechu leaves might contain phytochemicals similar to those found in the nuts, which might be the reason for the anti-inflammatory activity observed in this study. "}
