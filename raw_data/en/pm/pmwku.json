Design : Randomiz ed, double- blind, placebo- controlled pilot study . Participants : Fourte en women w ith high stress leve ls were recruited fr om an in-house re and alc ohol reha bilitation center. Interve ntion : Participants wer e randomly assig ned to either an ar omathera py group ( N = 6) or a plac ebo g roup ( N = 8). A ll participants re ceive d an ac upuncture treatment once a week for 6 c onsecutive w eeks. Outcome Measure s: The Perc eived Stress Sca le (PSS) and SF12v2 Hea lth Survey (quality of life mea surement) were the instruments used in this study . Results : The stress leve ls as measure d by the PSS were significantly reduc ed in both gr oups ( p < 0.05) inde pendently . The group experienc ed a g reater reduc tion in P SS and a g reater incr ease in SF12v2 Hea lthy Survey score s compare d to the place bo group. A be tween g roups ana lysis did not result in a significa nt differ ence for the PSS scores ( p > 0.05). H oweve r, a statistical diff erence w as found be tween groups for SF 12v2 score s (p < 0.05). Conclusions : Between g roups ana lysis did not s upport the hy aroma stress sig nificantly more than acupunc ture lone. Howe ver, thera experienc ed a sig nificantly ivhighe qua lity of life sc ores c ompare d to the place bo group. These results may be due to a small sample siz e, and mor e research is war rante d.

I n 2011, Americ ans ra ted their a verage stress leve l as 5.2 on a sca le from 1 to 10, whe re 1 is little or no stress and 10 is a g reat deal of stre ss. Thirty -nine pe rcent said that their stress had inc reased over the past y ear, and 22% repor ted experienc ing e xtreme stre ss (APA, 2012). I t was re cently deter mined that2 75% to 90% of a ll doctor visits are for stress-re lated ailments and c omplaints (Mental Health WebMD, 2013). Fur thermore , Occ upational Safe ty and He alth Administration (OSHA) dec lared stress a ha zard of the wor kplace , costing Americ an industry more than $300 billion annua lly to diminis tivity leg al and insura nce c osts (I MS Institut e for3 Healthcare Informatics, 2012) . Despite these statistics, Americans a re not be ing g iven ade quate support f or stress manag ement. I n 2012, 53% of Ame ricans survey ed by the APA re ported Stress is defined as \"the non specific result of any demand upon the body, be the effect mental1 or somatic\" (Gates, 2001, p. 390). Extreme stress is defined as a scale of an 8, 9, or 10 on a 10-point scale, where 1 is little to no2 stress and 10 is a great deal of stress (APA, 2013). The IMS moniker stands for Intercontinental Medical Statistics, which is the original name for3 the company. 1receiving little to no stress mana gement support fr om their hea lth care providers (APA, 2013). L ack of support become s problematic ove r time as chr onic stress has been show n to lead to a number of seve re conditions i et a l., 2012; Karpe n, 1996; Pert, Dre her & Ruff, 1998; 1994) . The most common trea tment strateg y for these conditions list ed is the presc ribing of phar mace uticals. This strateg y is costly and does not a ddress the r oot cause s of stress. I n 2011, Americ ans spent $263 billion dollars on prescr iption drugs (Center s for Medic are & Me dicaid Servic es, 2012). This is a sig nificant incr ease over the $234.1 billion doll ars spe nt in 2008, which is more than double the a mount spent in 1999 (Gu, Dillon, & B urt, 2010). F urthermor e, it was found tha t even pa tients with insurance spent $49 billion dol lars out-of- pocket on pr escription drugs in 2010 (I MS, 2012). Severa l treatment options are available when c onsidering the trea tment of stress. Some of the more py, acupr essure and/or pre scription drug s (Kar pen, 1996). Out of these options, the prescr iption of psy chotropic dr ugs, such as benzodiazepines and/or antidepr essants, ar e most preva lent among st primary care physicians (va n Rijswij k, Bor ghuis, van de L isdonk, Zitman, & van Weel, 2007). These pha rmac euticals ha ve bee n known to be habit for ming, a s well as assoc iated 2with Donog hue, 2009; van Rijswijk et al., side ef fects include: 1.Benzodiaz epines (c s such as Va lium and Xanax) have been show n to cause dementia a s well as impairments in cog nition, memory , coordina tion, al., 2010); and 2.Prozac and Z oloft, common brand na mes falling under the category of antidepre ssants, have be en shown to come with the following side eff ects: nausea , heada ches, f lu like sy d , Uchida, Watana & Kashima, 2011). Costs associated with the pre scription of these dr ugs are in the billions . For example, in 2010 America ns spent $27 billion dol lars on antidepr essants and antipsy chotics, combined ( Smit h, 2012). Given the hig h cost and potential ne gative side e ffects of drug s, options such as acupunc ture a nd aroma thera py may be two the safest and aff ordable treatment approa ches ( Buckle, 1997; Cooke & Ernst, 2000; L eung & Pang , 2011). While sever al researchers have e xamined and pr oven the a bility of ac upuncture and aroma thera py to reduc e stress individually , none have combined the two a pproac hes. This study explores the eff icacy of combining aroma thera py with acupunc ture to reduc e stress. Background of the Pr oblem The APA (2012) offered the following as the most common cause s of stress in Americ a: money , work, the 3health alth conce rns, job stability , housing c osts and persona l safety. When experience d at low levels or inf reque ntly, in short bursts, stress is considere d somewhat he althy , often a cting as a motivating factor (May o Clini c, 2013; McEwe n, 2000). Refe rring to this t ype of motivating , good stress, Hans Sely e (1974) coined the te rm eustress . The wor d eustress comes fr om the pref ix eu, which is derive d from the Gr eek w ord mea ning w ell or g ood. When eu is placed in fr ont of the word stre ss, it crea tes a ter m refe rring to good stre ss (Wiki pedia, 2013) . When a person is experienc ing eustress they feel a positive cog nitive response to stre ss that is healthy and consists of positive fee lings (N elson & Simm ons, 2004). Howe ver, ove r time, the hormones and phy siology that initially mediate the e ffects of stress on the body are no longe r able to adapt and pr otect the body , and ther efore stress be comes damag ing (McEwe n, 2000). F or example, ac ute stress enha nces immune func tion while prolong ed it (May o Clini c, 2013; McEwe n, 2000). Ac ute stress enha nces me eve tening yet chr onic stress cause s structural a nd functional c hang es within the brain whic h often lea d to depre ssion or Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD, McEwen, 2000) . Additionally , according to the APA (2011), c hronic stre ss is on the rise for many Americ ans and ha s reached a critica l level. For ty-four perc ent of Ame rican adults repor t that their stress leve ls have incr eased over the past 5 y ears, and almost a third of childre n repor t that they have e xperie nced phy sical hea lth problems relate d to stress (APA, 2011). I n addition, resea rch on 6,300 individuals found that stre ss has incre ased 18% for wome n and 24% f or men fr om 1983 to 2000 (APA, 2012). Since 4chronic stress may be one of the primary contributors to the deve lopment of disease s, there is a nee d to reduc e and e liminate it before it ca uses irre parable damag e. The c urrent standard of care relies upon pharmac ologic al trea tments to address symptoms associated with chronic stress. Some of the most common presc riptions include 1994) . In the Nethe rlands, it was found that over 50% of all patients tre ated f or a sing le mood disorder or single anxiety disorder w ere presc ribed one or a c ombination of these drug s (van Rijswik et al., 2007). A major c onsequenc e of pr escribing dr ugs to treat stress is that they are often habit forming and have negative side e ffects (Anthier ens et a l., 2010). This results in the pre scribing of additional drug s to treat the side e ffects or take people of f the ha bit- forming drug s (Lader et al., 2009). The conseque ntial vicious cy cle then be comes one that is increa singly more diff icult to break. A n example can be made by looking a t benzodiazepines, a pre scription drug group often pr escribed for a Gene ral Anxiety Disorder (GAD ), a c ondition found to be a direc t result of chr onic stress (G riffith et al., 2008). B enzodiazepines are found to be a ddictive, have sever al side ef fects, and are harmful whe n taken long term (L ader et al., 2009). O ne major pote ntial side eff ect of taking benzodiazepines is dementia. Acc ording to de Gag e et a l. (2012), use of benzodiazepines in older adults incre ases their chanc es of f alling vic tim to dementia by 50%. Simil arly, SSR Is, another c ommonly presc ribed drug in treating stress-re lated disorders, c ome with a set of unple asant side e ffects which & L eung , 2009). This leads to the se arch of alterna tive options in t he tre atment of stre ss. Two such options that uses the insertion of ne edles into specific points on the body , which ther eby promotes natura l healing , harmony within the body , and improves f unction (Ka rpen, 1996; L eung & Pang , 2011). This form of treatment is part of Chinese Medic ine, dates ba ck thousands of y ears and has be en used for centur ies to treat a varie ty of conditions, including stre ss (Kar pen, 1996). Aromathe rapy, the use of c oncentr ated e ssential oils ex tracted from he rbs, flower s, and other pla nt parts to trea t various disease s (Cooke & Ernst, 2000), has be en used for centur ies to treat a wide var iety of hea lth conditions, i ncluding stress and stress-re lated issues (Ha lcon, 2002). Perr y and Perr y (2006) r eport that a romather apy is found to be safe , without having the adver se effects that are c ommon among psychotropic dr ugs. Furthe rmore, it wa s found that ar omathera py is one of the most widely used and r equeste d modality within CAM (Horowitz, 2011; Yim et al., 2009). This paper will ex plore whe ther the c ombined use of a romather apy and ac upuncture is more e ffective in the re duction of stress leve ls than treatments that use a cupunctur e alone. Statem ent of the P roblem Current stre ss levels are consistently documented a t levels much hig her tha n what is consider ed hea lthy (APA, 2013). The APA (2013) r eporte d a 35% inc rease in stress levels c ompare d to the previous y ear. Some curre nt treatment a pproac hes that include phar mace uticals have been show n to have ha rmful conse quence s. There is an 6incre asing need f or patients to bec ome informed a bout effe ctive tre atment options when c onsidering how to reduc e, and possibly even e liminate, acupunc fective in treating stress stre ss-rela ted 1997; 2012; Perry & Per ry, 2006). Howe ver, e ven thoug h these a lternative modalities are know n by many to treat stre ss effe ctively , they are still widely underutilized due to a lac k of clinica l evidence (Nix, 2012). No resea rch y et exist s which examines the ef fects of combining a romather apy with acupunc ture in the treatment of stress re duction. Purpose of th e Study The purpose of the study is to compare the efficacy of using aroma thera py and acupunc ture versus a cupunctur . Rese of omathera py is more e ffective than a cupunctur Null Hyp stress levels whe is combined with ar omathera py compar ed to ac upuncture alone. Theoretic al Assumptions Based on existi ng clinical evide nce, it is assumed that a s independe nt treatments, acupunc ture a nd aroma thera pen, Ac upuncture , a of nese Me dicine (TCM) is a tool4 used to bring the var ious parts of the body into harmony with eac h other (K arpen, 1996). F rom the viewpoint of TCM, whe n a per son experience s stress, three things occur : Qi become s stag nated, Qi and blood become depleted a nd the spirit is5 6 7 disrupted. In the TCM theoretica l para digm, Qi stagnation is best understood as whe n the liver, the primar y organ sy stem aff ected by perc eived stre ss, is unable to maintain the smooth and steady function of the w hole body (Nix, 2012). The diag nosis of L iver Qi Stagna tion is very common in TCM and has bee n shown to be a c onsequenc e of a stressful life ( Mist, W right, Jones, & Carson, 2011). Sy mptoms of L iver Qi limbs k circ ulation, of the hypochondrium TCM nosis of iver iver a there by normalizing the fr ee-flow of Qi (Nix,8 2012). I n terms of Qi and blood exhaustion, also refe rred to as Qi and blood vac uity TCM is considered the most modern and up-to-date version of Chinese Medicine (Nix, 2012).4 Qi is often defined as energy, material force, vital force, or life force (Maciocia, 1989).5 \"Blood\" in TCM, is a dense fluid derived from the Qi converted from food by the Spleen. It is6 a form of Qi as Qi infuses life into blood. \"Without Qi, blood would be an inert substance\" (Maciocia, 1989, p. 52). \"Spirit\" is a TCM term referring to the spirit of a person's vitality and the state of mental,7 emotional, and spiritual being (Maciocia, 1989). For purposes of this study, the term \"coursing\" means to \"get the function of the liver working8 smoothly\" (Nix, 2012, p. 7). 8or Qi and blood def iciency , acupunc ture ha s also been e ffective in tonify ing, or nourishing the body 's Qi and blood (De adman, Al- Khaf aji, & B ffective tre atment used to ca lm and settle the spirit (Deadman e t al., 1998; Maciocia , 1989). The fina l assumption made in this st udy is that the point protocol utili zed will accomplish t he goals of: cour sing the liver and r ectify ing the free-flow of Qi, supplementing Qi and blood; and ca lming the spirit. L iver 3 Tai C hong and L arge Intestine 4 He Gu were sele cted to addr L iver Qi Stagna 36 Zu San Li was c hosen to tonify Qi and blood. Yin Tang M-HN-3 was a dded to ca lm the spirit. 9 Further discussion of the a cupunctur e points and their sy nergistic effe cts are discussed in Chapter 3. Importance of the Study There is gr eat ne ed for evidenc e-based re search to show the potential e fficacy of aromathera py and ac upuncture in the of reduc ing stre ss levels. Phy sicians have a desire a nd need f or alter natives to presc ription drug s. Forty -four perc ent of family medical pr actitioners surve yed re ported that they were not in favor of presc ribing benzodiazepine, y et they felt there is a lack of clinical evide nce to a pplying nonpharma colog ic appr oache s (Anthiere ns et al., 2010). Give n the potential side effects of pr escription drugs, a nd the hig h costs associate d with them, it becomes incre asing ly important to demonstrate the e fficacy of ac upuncture and ar omathera py on lowering levels (Ma Ha mmerschlag , Lewith, & Schny er, 2008) . For the purpose of this study, the term \"tonify\" or \"tonifying\" is synonymous with9 supplementing. 9This study will be the first attempt to compar e the e ffectiveness of lowering stress by combining a romather apy with acupunc ture. To da te, re search exists t hat examines the eff icacy of ac upuncture and ar omathera py independe nt of one a nother; howeve r, none tha t examine the potential effe ct when both a pproac hes ar e used together. Scope of the Stu dy The study consisted of 14 pa rticipants from a n in-patient addic tion California . The pa rticipants wer e women ove r the a ge of 18 who wer e being treated for dr ug and alc ohol addiction. All participants complete d the Participant Consent F orm (see Appendix A) and we re randomly place d in either Group A or Group B befor e the be ginning of the 6-we ek tre atment prog ram. I n addition, all participants complete d the following two questionnaires pr ior to beginning the tr ial and af ter the la st treatment of the trial, 6 wee ks later: (a ) the Perce the SF12v2 H ealth Appendice s B and C, respe ctively ). These instruments were chosen be cause they are the most widely used, re cognized, and acc epted tools for me asuring nonspecific perc eived stre ss and quality of life ( Cohen, Kama rack, & Me rmelstein, 1983; Ware e t al., 2010). The pa rticipants re ceive d wee kly treatments for 6 conse cutive we eks. Due to a small number of pa rticipants, this study is intended as a pr eliminary investiga tion into the ef ficacy of ac upuncture combined with ar omathera py and the r eduction of stre ss. The re sulting finding s will provide a basis fr om which future researchers c an build, challeng e, and/or validate a dditional related a reas of study . 10Defini tion of Term s For the purposes of this study , a sele ct group of ter ms is being de fined a s follows: Acupun cture : Acupunc ture, within the TCM, involves the insertion of nee dles into specific a cupunctur e points on the body . It is an ancie nt healing modality that g oes bac k thousands of y ears and ce nters on bring ing ba lance within the body (Karpen, 1996; L eung & Pang , 2011). I nstitut of Aromather apy define s aromathe rapy as \"a natura l treatment whic h uses the conc entra ted her bal ene rgies in essential oils from plants in associa tion , friction, inhalation, (Buckle, 2010, p. 10) . Essential Oi ls: These oils ar e obtained f rom conc entra ted steam distillates from aroma tic plants, as well as the expression from the pee ls of some citrus fr uits (Buc kle, 1997; Perry & Per ry, 2006). The pr ocess in which e ssential oils are e xtracted is as follows: Plant material is placed in a still and stea m is passed throug h it. The steam, mixed with volatile oils, is then passed throug h a conde nser whic h cools it. After cooling , the oils which are nonsoluble in water, f loat to the top and ar e tappe d off. The re sulting fluid comprises e ssential oils. To provide an idea of the qua ntities of plant materia l nece ssary to oils, 200 kg of Lavandula augustif olia flower s will produce 1 kg of esse ntial oil, while between 2 a nd 5 metric tons of rose petals will be nee ded to produc e the sa me quantity (Buckle, 1997) . 11Limbic System : From the L atin word \" limbus\" which means bor der, the limbic system refers to structur es on the inner border of the c erebrum and floor of the10 dience phalon (Tor tora & Grabowski, 1993). Sometimes called the \" emotional\" bra in, the limbic sy stem has primary functions in memory associations with pain, plea sure, anger, rage, fear, sor row, doc ility, and af fection. For e xample, inhalation of a scent from a f ood that once ma de an individual ill will travel throug h the olfac tory pathway s and limbic sy stem, and ca use fe eling s of nause a (Tor tora & Grabowski, 1993). Olfactor y System : For purposes of this study , olfac tory system will refe r to the physiology within the body that is responsible for olf action, other wise known a s the sense of smell. Specifically , the olfac tory system is made up of: olfac tory receptor cells, olfac tory bulb, and olfac tory tract (Tortora & G rabow ski, 1993). Stress: For purposes of this study , stress is being define d as \"The non-spec ific response of the body to any demand f or cha nge\" (Selye, 1956, p. 54). Stated a nother way, stress is \"a c onstraining force or influe nce: a s a phy sical, che mical, or e motional factor that ca uses bodily or mental tension and ma y be a f actor in disease c ausation\" (Mer riam Webster, 2013b, pa ra. 1[c]). Summ ary The g oal of this projec t is to assess the use of a romather apy and ac upuncture in the re duction of stress. I t is hoped that by prese nting c linical evidenc e of the efficacy of aromathera py combined with ac upuncture that more TCM pra ctitioners will The components olfactory bulbs, and bundles of & Grabowski, 1993). 12incorpora te treatments a nd there by incre ase the possibili ty of treatment effic acy. 13Chapter I I LITERATURE REVI EW The purpose of this pilot s tudy is to determine if a cupunctur e combined w ith aroma thera py is more ef fective in reduc ing stre ss levels than ac upuncture treatment only. Four teen wome n, randomly place d into two gr oups, participate d in a 6-we ek clinical trial, whe rein e veryone we ekly ture tre atment. One g roup received a romather apy, and one g roup re ceive d a plac ebo of spr ing w ater. This chapter will present historical a theore thera py. Following that discussion will be a revie w of important and re lated re search studies. Historical P erspec tives Hans Sely e found tha t regardle ss of the ca use of stre ss, be it phy sical, mental/emotional or che mical in nature , real or imag ined, the same physiologica l and behavior al reactions occ ur. The r refe rred to While perf orming experiments, Selye (1956) discovere d that injecting rats with stress hormone s resulted in enla rged adrenal g lands, shrunken ly mphatic g blee ding g astro-intestinal ulce rs. He surmised that the more stre ss a per son experience d, the more likely it was the he or she would become ill (Buckle , 1997). 14Acupunc ture, a n ancie nt form of Asian me dical tre atment g oing ba ck as f ar as the Stone Ag e or f arthe r, is considere d an ef fective method to preve nt illness, maintain health, and ha s been use d to treat a myriad of stre ss-rela ted phy sical and me ntal conditions (L iangyue et a l., 1987). The pr actice of ac upuncture has bee n used for centur ies to minim ize the neg ative ef fects that stress has on the body (Lucas, 2011) . More r ecently, extensive studies have bee n conducte d in an ef fort to explain the underly ing me chanisms of the e fficacy of ac upuncture (Cabiog lu & Cetin, 2008). I n their sy stematic re view, Cabiog lu and Cetin (2008) pre sented seve ral studies providing evidenc e that ac upuncture is effe ctive in trea ting a \"aromathera pie,\" a romather apy is known to have c ome from the French c hemist Rene-Maur ice Ga ttefosse in the late 1920s, who beg an exploring the use of e ssential oils for medicinal purpose s after his hand was ba dly burned in a labora tory experiment. He soake d his injury in pure lave nder oil and soon notice d rapid, a lmost m iraculous healing and pain r elief ( Buckle, 1997, p. 37). F or thousands of years, aromathe rapy has bee n used as a healing modality in many cultures, suc h as: Iraq, F rance, Mesopotamia, E gypt, China, I ndia, Tibet, Gre ece, Persia, Ar abia, a nd Europe. I t has bee n said that Hippocra tes maintained that a romatic ba ths and massag es promoted g ood health (Robins, 1999). Contemporary aroma thera py proposes that va rious possess thera peutic prope rties that have the ability to have a positive influence on mood, behavior, a nd health (H erz, 2009). B eing highly regarded for its hea ling a bility , 15French me dical students ar e required to study aroma thera py, and it is prescr ibed by licensed phy sicians (L avabr e, 1990). A romather apy is h inhalation, or skin applica tion (Holmes, 1995). F or the purposes of this trial, participants will rec eive a romather apy via inhalation. Theoretic al Literature There is a g ood deal of research that supports the possible relationship betwe en stress and c auses of death ( Cohen et al., 2012; L ucas, 2011) . The Center for Dise ase Control (CDC) reporte d that the five le ading cause s of dea th in the United States are : (a) hear t disease; (b) canc er; (c \"accidents,\" further define d as unintentional injuries (Murphy , Xu, & Kocha nek, 2012). Thr ee examples are a s follows: 1.Chronic stress in adults ca uses the re lease of nore pinephrine, e pinephrine, cortisol, aldosterone , growth hormone, a dditional stress hormones and thyroxin, which has be en found to c ause he art disea se (Rober t-McComb, Tacon, Randolph, & ra, 2004) . 2.Delvilbiss et al. (2012) f ound that stress was a major contributing factor in over ha lf of all wor k place accidents; and (3) Cohen e t al. (2012) e xamined the ef fects of chronic stress on inflammation and g lucocor ticoid rec eptor resistanc e. In particula Hy pothalamic- Pitui tary-Adre nocortica l (HPA) Put another w ay, this disruption neg atively affects the body 's ability to reg ulate inflammation and results in an exag gerated re lease of inflammatory cytokines within the nose which almost alwa ys leads to upper respira tory disease ( Cohen et al., 2012). 16From a TCM point of view, the neg ative ef fects of stress ar e assoc following patterns: (a ) Liver Qi Stagna tion; (b) Qi and/or blood def iciency ; and/or (c) Restless Spirit (Deadman e t al., 1998; Maciocia , 1989). I n the ca se of L iver Qi Stagna tion, escala ted and ha rmful levels of stre ss impair the L iver's a bility to perfor m its function of promoting the free flow of Qi in the body . There fore, Qi stagnates a nd does not rea ch the or gan sy stems and var ious parts of the body . Symptoms of L iver Qi Stagna tion mirror those associa ted with stress from a Western medica l point of view and include: de pression, sig poor appetite, irr itability , ang er, fatigue, Premenstrua l Syndrome (PMS), muscle tension, che st pain, and hea dache (APA, 2013; Liangyue et a l., 1987). The 39th cha pter of Basic Questions says: \"Over strain or stre ss consume the11 vital ener gy of the body \" (Liangyue, et a l., 1987, p. 249). Qi and blood ar e the substances tha t comprise the vital ene rgy of the body which is the nourishment necessary for the or gan sy stems of the body to properly perform their func tions (Liangyue et a l., 1987). For example, when the L iver org an is not proper ly nourished with Qi and blood, it cannot per form its function of c irculating Qi to the other org an systems and the body as a w hole. Without an ade quate supply of Qi and blood, the ability of the other organ sy stems to perfor m their respe ctive func tions is i nhibited, there by leading to disease pa tterns within the body (Liangyue et a l., 1987). Stress share s many of the same signs a nd sy mptoms of Qi and blood def iciency . For example, stress, as we ll as Qi and blood def iciency , commonly prese nt as fatig ue, The Basic Questions, also known as the Suwen, is an ancient Chinese medical text considered11 to be the fundamental doctrinal source for Chinese Medicine. 17irritability , depre ssion, 1989). In addition to stagna ting L iver Qi and deple ting Qi and blood, stress ca n affect a person' s spirit. W hen stress leve ls reac h a point that beg ins to deplete a pe rson's general state of vitality , a per son's spirit can be unsettled, which is not considere d a healthy state. The \" Simpl e Que stions,\" as cited by Macioc ia (1989), sa ys: \"If there is spirit the person thrives, if the re is no spirit the per son dies\" (p. 144) . Symptoms of disrupted spirit are simil ar to sy mptoms associated with stress: insomnia, unhealthy complexion, depression, ang er, la ck of e nergy, an uncle ar mind, and/or the tre atment of stre ss it is important to move L iver Qi, tonify and nourish the substanc es of Qi and blood, and settle/calm the spirit. In 2003, the World Health Org anization stated that acupunc ture is an e ffective thera py in treating stress among 50 other disea ses (Eshke vari e t al., 2012). With t he emer gence of more c linical evidenc e, acupuncture is now being an ac cepte d trea tment option (L eung & Pang , 2011). I n fac t, rec ent studies have show n that acupunc ture is now the best-know n and tec hnique in alterna tive medicine ( Leung & Pang , 2011). Specific a cupunctur e points have e mpirical evidenc e in their e ffectiveness of12 moving, or \"cour sing\" the L iver Qi, tonify ing Qi and blood, and c alming the spirit For purposes of this study, empirical is defined as: \"originating in or based on observation or12 experience\" (Merriam-Webster, 2013a, para. 1). 18(Deadman e t al., 1998). While there a re several acupunc ture points that fall within these c ategories, a se lect g roup wa s selecte d for this study . The fir st four of the se ven points used in this study are collectively referred to as \"The Four Gates\" and consist of bilater al nee dle insertion of L iver 3 Tai C hong and LI 4 He Gu. The F our Ga tes are commonly used to trea t stress resulting from Qi and emotions being stuck in the body (Howa rd, 2010). Stomach 36 Zu San Li , a common TCM ac upuncture point, has been use d to treat stress among a var iety of hea lth conditions (Eshkevari e t al., 2012). Ac cording to one of the classic texts of TCM, S tomach 36 Zu San Li will produce the following actions whe n stimul ated: tonify Qi, nourish blood, and ca lm the spirit (Deng et al., 1997). De adman e t al. (1998) c laims it i s the single most im portant point in generating Qi and blood. Fur thermore , experiments perfor med on par ticipants during acute stress showed tha t stim ulation of Stomach 36 Zu San Li stimul ation of the hy pothalamic-pituitary -adrenal reduc ing the negative physiologica l effe cts of the a cute stre ss (Eshkeva ri et al., 2012). Finally , the last of the a cupunctur e points selecte d for this study , Yin Tang M-HN-3, calms the spirit and is a powe rful and e ffective point in the trea tment of insomnia, anx iety, and ag itation (Dea dman et al., 1998) . There is a wea lth of literature that explores the potential of ar omathera py as a healthy modality . Over the past 20 y ears, there ha s been a n emer gence of clinica l trials and re search into ef fects of aroma thera py. A litera aroma thera py performed in 2000, re sulted in finding 12 r andomized control trials. Six of the trials we re found to have no indepe ndent re plication, and 6 of the 12 trials 19related to the re laxing effects of ma ssage (Cooke & Ernst, 2000). A more recent systematic re view of a romather apy literature was pe rformed re sulting in 18 studies, providing clinical evide nce tha t aromathe rapy can sig and beha vior (He rz, 2009). Additional evidence of the e fficacy of aroma thera py to reduc e stress c ame f rom a study performed in Kore a whe rein 36 fema le hig h school students were randomly assig ned to either receive a roma tre atment or plac ebo to re duce stre ss. Stress levels wer e significantly lower w hen the students received the a romather apy (via inhala tion) compare d to when they received plac ebo (Seo, 2009). While aroma thera py was found to be benef icial, all authors c oncluded that more re search wa s neede d (Cooke & Ernst, 2000; Kiecolt-Gla ser et al., 2008). The spec ific esse ntial oils used to crea te the ar omathera py in this st udy include: ylang-ylang, rose, g rapefruit, and lave nder. The se oils were selec ted base d on clinical evidenc e of e fficacy in treating stress, examples of which f ollow. For years, ylang-ylang has bee n widely regarded as possessing sedative proper ties (Moss, Hewitt, Moss, & Wesnes, 2008; Tissera nd, 1993). Ylang -ylang found to signif icantly incre ase c almness in a study testing the effects of pe ppermint and y lang-ylang on cog nitive perfor mance and mood (Moss et al., 2008). H ongratanawor akit and B uchbaue r (2004) thera antly reduc ed blood pre t rate. This is a finding , since hy perte nsion and hig h hear t rate ha ve bee n linked to the development of heart disease ( Robert-McComb et a l., 2004). Fina lly, a group of r esearchers combined ylang-ylang with lavender essential oils to crea te a blend a imed at re ducing stress. After inhalation of the blend onc e daily for 4 we eks, par ticipants in this s tudy 20experience d a re duction in subjective stress, ser um cortisol levels, and blood pre ssure. Thus, it was conc luded that the combination of y lang-ylang with lavender is an effective tr eatment f or stress (H wang , 2006). In a study performed on 40 he althy volunteers, inhala tion of rose e ssential oil (Rosa damasce ne) caused sig nificant de creases of brea thing r ate, blood oxy gen saturation, and sy stolic blood pressure. The finding s from this resea rch pr ovided evidenc e that rose oil is tive in reduc ing stre ss and depr ession humans (Hong akit, 2009). Grapefruit essential oil ( Citrus paradis ) was added to the ble nd to addre ss depre ssion that is often associated w ith L iver Qi Stagna tion and stress (Mist et al., 2011). A g roup of Japanese researchers f ound that citrus essential oils, such as grapefruit, re stored stress- induced immunosuppression and induce d calm beha vior. Furthermore , they discovere d that the applica tion of these oils to depressive pa tients made it possible to markedly reduc e the dose s of antidepr essants nee ded (K omori, Fujwa ra, Ta 1995) . Finally , the ef fects lavende r have been studied e xtensively . Buc kle (1993) used the e ssential oils from two differ ent spec ies of lave nder in a randomized, double-blind trial and f ound that the ef fects of two differ ent spec ies of lave nders we re signific antly differ ent. Specific ally, it was found that Lavandula burnati was a lmost twice a s effective a s Lavandula angustafol ia in reduc ing the emotional and beha vioral stress levels. This disproved the hypothesis that aromathe rapy is effe ctive pure ly because of touch, ma ssage, or pla cebo a nd proved the efficacy of lave nder ( Buckle, 1993). I n addition, Horowitz (2011) hig hlighted the positive effe cts of lave nder in r 21systematic re view of c urrent aromathe rapy research. Presented in he r research wa s a study of the e ffects of lave nder on c ortisol and chromog ranin A ( stress marke rs) on 30 healthy adults. A statistically signific ant diffe rence was found betwe en the lave group red to ontrol owitz, 2011). Resear ch into aroma thera py from a T CM point of view reve aled that e ach of the essential oils employ ed for this study addre ss the three patterns r esulting f rom stress. For example, lavender , grapefruit, and r ose move L iver Qi stagnation and course the L iver (Willmont, 2005; Yuen, 2002) , Rose and y Qi and blood (Holmes, 2001), a nd lavende r, rose , and y Stud ies An online sea rch of many sites did not produce publica tions that focused on13 the combination of a cupunctur e and a romather apy to treat stre ss. Howeve r, the sea rch did unear th three studies involving the use of a romather apy with acupr essure . Shin14 and L ee (2007) per formed a pilot st udy on the trea tment of hemipleg ic shoulder pa in and motor powe r in stroke pa tients using ar omathera py and ac upressure . They conclude d that when a romather apy was c ombined with acupr essure more positive effects re sulted versus ac upressure alone. At the sa me time, they suggested that more research is neede d. Yip and Tse ( 2004) found that a cupre ssure with lave Today, EMBASE, and EBSCO. For purposes of this study, acupressure shall be defined as the application of physical pressure14 by fingers, elbows, or other devises on specific acupuncture points on the body (Jarmey & Tindall, 1991). 22aroma thera py was sig nificantly more e ffective than c are that did not include these modalities. A few y ears later, Yip a nd Tse (2006) conclude d that acupr essure combined with lavende r esse tha n acupr essure treatment. Yim et al. (2009) c onducted a meta ana lysis of studies published from 2000 to 2008 that repor ted on the ef ficacy of using aroma thera py to treat de pression. They conclude d that the use of e ssential oils is s ignif icantly more e ffective in trea ting depre ssive disorder tha n the use of a place bo. In terms of re search on individual essential oils, an incre asing number of studies have be en conduc ted to assess lave nder' s effect on the a utonomic nervous system (Duan e t al., 2007; Horowitz, 2011). Finding s demonstrated tha t the use of lavende r fragrance depr esses sy mpathetic ac tivity while aug menting pa rasympathetic activity in normal adults, there by promoting r elaxation and being benef icial in trea ting patients with various ty pes of a utonomic dy sfunctions. Since the a utonomic nervous system supports so many of the body 's involuntary actions and or gan sy stems, it seems safe to sugg est that lavende r can trea t a larg e number of conditions, with stress, undoubtedly , being one of the m (Duan e t al., 2007; Horowitz, 2011). Summ ary of Literature Findings The historica l and theore tical re search litera ture pre sents a g reat deal of evidenc e to support the assumptions that acupunc ture a nd aroma thera py are effective independe nt of ea ch other . Howeve r, while the studies on the independe nt treatments of a cupunctur e and a romather apy have pr eliminarily shown to 23reduc e stress leve ls, no resea rch, to da te, has c onsidered the combined use a nd potential eff ects of the se modalities. Only three studies were found to be re motely simil ar, w herein the thera py with acupr essure in the treatment of pain (Shin & L ee, 2007; Yip & Tse, 2004, 2006). This proje ct examined the trea tment py ture in the re duction of stress. 24Chapter I II RESEARC H METHOD S This study examined the eff icacy of combining aroma thera py with acupunc ture in the trea tment of stress. Specific ally, the purpose of the study was to dete rmine whether acupunc ture c acupunc ture tre atment alone. Par ticipating in the study were 14 women r ecruited from an a ddiction rec overy cente r, a popula tion with inherently high stre ss levels. Participants re ceive d a 30-minute a cupunctur e treatment once a we ek for a per iod of 6 wee ks. One g roup re ceive d aroma thera py while the other group re ceive d a plac ebo of spring water . This chapter prese nts the rese arch methods utili zed to determine the effectivene ss of using a romather apy with acupunc ture to re duce stre ss. The g uidelines and par ameter s of the clinica l study are discussed. I n addition, a detailed e xplanation of the a cupunctur e point protocol and e ssential oils is i ncluded. Rese arch Approach This study ebo-c ontrolled pilot study . Rese arch De sign This study used two blinded g roups in a ra ndomiz ed contr e g roups re ceive d the same a cupunctur e 25treatment, Group A re ceive d aroma thera py and Gr oup B, se rving as the c ontrol g roup, received a place bo. Table 1 Researc h Design Prete st-Posttest Contr ol Design ture a nd Aromathe A Pre Group B Acupunc ture a nd PlaceboGroup B Pre Group B Post The dura tion of the study was 6 we eks and e xamined the e fficacy of adding aroma duce pe rceived stress leve ls and improve quality of life. Two assistants participa ted in this study \u2014\"Assistant-1\" a nd \"Assistant-2.\" Both ve an kground in ac license d acupunc turist and Assistant-2 a g radua te of the Ma sters of Traditional Or iental Medicine prog ram, a waiting state licensur e. Assistant-1 provide d presc reening a t the beg inning of the trial, collec ted pre trial survey s, delivere d the aroma thera py to the participa nts during the ir wee kly treatment, and collec ted posttrial survey s. Assistant-2 prepa red the bottles of aroma thera py and plac ebo prior to the commence ment of the study and sec ured the trial docume ntation (survey s) and da ta. 15 The two a romather apy bottles were prepa red by placing a sticker with \"A\" on one Surveys containing participant data were held by Assistant-2 in a locked filing cabinet until15 the trial was completed to prevent bias. 26bottle and \"B \" on the other . Assistant-2 was the only one with knowledg e of w hich bottled contained the a romather apy versus whic h one conta ined a spring water place bo. The \" A\" bottle conta ined ar omathera py in spring w ater and the \" B\" bottle contained spr ing w ater only . A key problem with human olfac tory research is the cre ation of a pla cebo. I n terms of prior research, few studies are blind (single or double) a nd many assess only a single odor without control conditions (Kiec olt-Glaser et al., 2008). F or the purpose s of this study , inhalation was c hosen for the method of a romather apy administration based on pr ior studies, and the use of a plac ebo wa s elec ted to preve nt bias by not giving one group ar omathera py treatment (Moss et al., 2008; Take da et a l., 2008). Randomiz ation of the pa rticipants was a ccomplished by placing 30 slips of paper within sealed sec urity envelope s. Fifte en of the 30 envelope s contained slips16 of pape r with \"Gr oup A\" on them a nd 15 envelope s contained slips of pape r with \"Group B.\" All 40 envelopes w ere place d in a box, and participants selec ted an envelope at ra ndom. All participants re ceive d the same w eekly acupunc ture the Primary Investig ator )/acupuncturist. Serin brand, sing le use, 34 g auge, 1.5 inch17 needle s were inserted a t each of the spec ific ac upuncture points to a depth of approximately 1/4 to 1/2 of an inch and turne d slightly clockwise once. Thick paper stock was used to ensure that contents inside the envelope could not be seen from16 the outside. The PI/acupuncturist is a licensed acupuncturist and has been practicing TCM and17 acupuncture for over 13 years. 27The seve n acupunc ture points included in the ac upuncture point protocol used in eac h wee kly treatment included: L iver 3 Tai C hong (bilatera l), Large Intestine 4 He Gu (bilatera l), Stomach 36 Zu San Li (bilatera l) and Yin Ta ng M-HN-3. The protoc ol was de signe d to course L iver Qi, tonify Qi and blood, as we ll as calm the spirit. The PI /acupunc turist vacate d the room af ter inser tion of all the nee dles. Assistant-1 then ca me into the room and provide d the ar omathera py by placing three spray s from either Bottle A or Bottle B onto a cotton ball and plac ed that same cotton ball onto the participa nt's chest, within 12 inches f rom the par ticipant's nose. B ottle A contained a romather apy, and B ottle B c ontained the plac ebo of spr ing w ater. This method of plac ebo contr ol group was e lected due to its ease of a dminist ration and effective use in prior studies (Kiec olt-Glaser et al., 2008). The a romather apy employ ed for this study was a blend of na tural and or ganic essential oils. Natura l and org anic oils are considere d superior ove r, and more effective tha n, synthetic oils (Holmes, 1995). I n addition, a blend ver sus single essential oil approa ch wa s chosen to avoid ne gative assoc iations with a single e ssential oil, which may then alter the re sults of the study (Holmes, 2009). The essential oils used to cre ate the ble nd wer e spec ifically selec ted bec ause the y are widely purported relaxant odors, with stress re lief re peate dly ascribed to them (B uckle, 1997; Worwood, 1991). The following Snow L otus essential oils were added to one of the 2-ounc e18 glass spray bottles containing spring water to make up the a romather apy: ylang-ylang Snow Lotus, Inc., a company providing organic and natural essential oils, is located in Santa18 Rosa, CA. 28(2 drops), r ose (2 dr ops), g rapefruit (4 drops) , and lave nder ( 2 drops). Clinical evidenc e on the e ffectiveness of some of these oils blended tog ether , as we ll as specific individual effica cy, is presente d in Chapter 2. After 25 minutes, Assistant-1 returne d to the room and re moved the cotton ball from the pa rticipant's c hest, as we ll as from the room. The PI/acupunc turist then returne d to the room and re moved the nee dles. Having Assistant-1 deliver a nd remove the ar omathera py was a n attempt to keep the PI /acupunc ture blind and ther eby unbiased. I n addition, the room was a ired for a minimum of 5 minut es in prepa ration for the ne xt participant a nd to ensure no a romas ling ered afte r the tre atment was Hyp othesis The null hy was: no sig nificant ( p > .05) r eduction in stress levels due to a cupunctur e combined w ith aromather apy compar ed ture a lone. Partic ipan t tion was a double-blinded, c ontrolled pilot. I nitially , 32 participa nts were included in an e ffort to obtain an adequa te number of participa nts to show signif icanc e (n = 30), w hile maintaining ma nageability and ac counting for anticipated a ttrition (MacPherson e t al., 2008). A fly er was posted on a c ommunity bulletin board 3 we eks prior to the study commence ment (see Appendix D). A random a ssignment method wa s used wher eby participa nts who passed the initial inclusion/ex clusion ia (see Appendix E) selecte d an enve lope from a box. There were 30 sec urity seale d envelope s within the box . Fifte en enve lopes had \" Group A\" slip of r inside the enve lope; 15 had \"G roup B .\" Gr oup A re ceive d the aroma thera py, while Group B received a place bo of spring water . Participants wer e recruited f rom a San Die go County in-house re sidential drug and alc ohol reha bilitation center that c aters to women over the age of 18 tha t have children, or who ar e pre gnant. All women re ceive standardized ca re tha t includes counseling , lifesty rang es from 8 to 18 months . Whil e the c enter houses women over the age of 18, the ages of pa rticipants selec ted for the study fell within the rang e of 22 to 49 and include d individuals from all rac ial and ethnic g roups. This particular population was chose n for its inhere ntly high le vels of stress. It has bee n found that due to c oncurr ent leg al, fa milial, and financia l problems, recovering addicts ente ring recovery prog rams have substantially highe r stress leve ls compar ed to those of he althy adults (Hy man et al., 2009) .19 An initial inclusion/ exclusion criteria c hecklist consisting of six questions was performed on a ll prospective pa rticipants (see Appendix E). Ex amples of e curr ently preg nant or ha ve you delivere d a child in the past 6 wee ks?\"; \"Can y ou lie down on y our bac k for 30 minutes? \"; \"To y our knowledg e do y ou have a llergies or adve rse reactions to essential oils or aroma thera py\"; and \" Can y ou rea d Eng lish? \" For purposes of this study, \"healthy\" will be defined as having PSS and SF12v2 scores within19 normal ranges as defined by the creators of each measurement instrument. 30Using a random assignme nt method, participants we re pla ced into one of two groups\u2014Group A or Group B . Group A r eceived the ar omathera py; Group B received a plac ebo. Participants re ceive d wee kly treatments for 6 conse cutive we eks. Eac h treatment lasted 30 minutes and consisted of a cupunctur e and a romather apy. The Primary Investig ator/ac upuncturist, with over 13 y ears of experienc e, per formed a ll of the nee dle insertions, manipulations, and re movals. Assistant-1 delivere d all the aroma thera py, while the PI /acupunc turist was out of the room. Instrum entation The Perc eived Stress Sca le (PSS) and the SF12v2 He alth Survey were used to assess stress leve l and per ceive d quality of life ( Appendice s B a nd C, respec tively ). The two instruments used to mea sure stre ss levels in this st udy require d differ ent means in orde r to obtain score s from the individual questionnaire s. The PSS i s a 10-question survey with the following scoring possibili ties for e ach que stion: (0) Ne ver, ( 1) Almost Never , (2) Sometimes, (3) F airly Often, ( 4) Ve ry Often. F or questions numbered 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, a nd 10, the answe rs circ led on the surve y are calculated on the 0 to 4 sca le shown above . For questions numbered 4, 5, 7, a nd 8, the answe rs circ led on the surve y are inverted w hereby 2s become 3s and 3s bec ome 2s. After conver sion of questions 4, 5, 7, and 8, all score s are added tog ether to result in a final PSS score . This conver sion was done f or all the pa rticipants' re sponses to the PSS survey . Use of the SF12v2 Hea lth Survey is gr anted only by permission. Permission to use the SF12v2 H ealth Survey , as we ll as the statistical software that analy zes the 31results, was g rante d. The spec ific statistical softwar e prog ram used to c alculate the SF12v2 Hea lth Survey score s was the Qua lity Metric He alth OutcomesTM Scoring Software version 4.5. A mix ed 2 x 2 ANOVA test and pow er analysis was perf ormed on da ta using a profe ssional edition of SP SS, version 20. The data a nalysis was conduc ted upon completion of the study and the mixed 2 x 2 ANOVA tests and power analy sis were performed by an indepe ndent statistician, in order to e liminate bias on the part of the PI/acupunc turist. Data Collec tion Participants filled out the two ys prior to rec eiving the first trea tment and after receiving the final tre atment 6 wee ks later. Assistant-2 r eviewe d eac h survey to make sure it was complete, the n secur ed said surve ys until completion of the trial. Index cards, cr eated for e ach pa rticipant, conta ined the par ticipant's name, g roup association (A or B ), and tre atment dates. The index cards wer e held a nd manag ed by Assistant-1, who also provided the aroma thera py for e ach tr eatment. This informa tion was ke pt from the PI /acupunc turist to prevent bias. Data Analysis The pre test, baseline da ta collec ted wer e the pa rticipants' initial responses to two survey s: The Perc eived Stress Sca le (PSS) and the He Survey . Postt est data inc ticipants' re sponses to the same surve ys after 6 wee ks of treatment. Confirmation that the data we re nor mally distributed was ac hieved by performing an Ande rson-Da rling test on all results. There fore, para metric tests we re employ ed to re veal tre atment ef ficacy. Pre-post test PSS and SF12v2 using a paire d Student's t-Test. The reafter, be tween g roups ana lysis was performed using a 2 (g roup) x 2 (time) analy sis of varianc e (ANOVA) , with repe ated measure s for both the PSS and SF12v2 Hea lth Survey score s. Methodol ogical Assum ptions For the purposes of this study , sever al assumptions were made. F irst, it was assumed that all par ticipants have f unctioning olf actor y systems. A proper ly working olfac tory system will transmit t he ar oma to the bra in for proc essing . More specific ally, upon inhalation, the sce nt from the ar omathera py would trave l into the nose and be received by milli ons of hair- like rec eptors, which a re connecte d to the olfac tory bulb. From the olfa ctory bulb, the smell travels throug h the olfac tory tract to the olfac tory cente r of the br ain wher e it connec ts to the lim bic sy stem. From he re a chain r eaction occurs, whic h affects other parts of the body (Buckle, 1997) . Study participa nts were require d to attend all six treatments, consecutively . They were droppe d from the study if they missed one trea tment. They were instructed to report pr egnancy or adve rse reactions to Assistant-1. Either of these conditions20 would also result in their re moval from the study . Since this was a double- blinded study , Assistant-2 delivere d the ar omathera py only after the PI /acupunc turist left the room. The sa me assistant remove d the aroma thera py befor e the PI /acupunc turist returned to r emove the ne edles. The cotton ball containing aroma thera py or plac ebo wa s removed f rom the trea tment room after Adverse reactions included: allergic reaction, headaches, or any intolerable discomfort from20 the acupuncture or aromatherapy. 33each trea tment. I n addition, the room was a ired for 5 minutes betwee n trea tments to dissipate linge ring of ar omas. Limit ations of Stud y A discussion of limitations merits considera tion in thi s study . First, the f inal number of pa rticipants ea sy, rete ntion was challeng ing. example, participa nts beca me pre gnant during the cour se of the study , six beca me ill and wer e quar antined, thre e were require d to appea r in court, a nd four c ould not find child care . There fore, the final number of 14 par ticipants resulted due to attrition. Lastly, when testing odor, or in this case aroma thera py, it is di fficult to have a control g roup or plac ebo. Spring water was used a s the place bo for this study , as it was found to be an ef fective control method in prior re search (G oel, Hy ungsoo, & L ao, 2005; Kiecolt-Gla ser et al., 2008). Organization of Rem aind er of Study In the cha pters to follow, an a nalysis of collecte d data f or all par ticipants will be pre sented. The final cha pter will contain c onclusions and re commendations for further study . 34Chapter I V RESEARC H FINDINGS The purpose of this study was to dete rmine if combining aroma thera py with acupunc ture a s a method of tre atment was more effective in r educing stress levels compar ed to ac upuncture , ifically , re search was: The combined tre atment of a cupunctur e and a romather apy is more ef fective than acupunc ture a lone. This chapte r desc ribes the f indings of this study , along with an analy sis of trends and pa tterns. This chapter is org anized into four subsections: Desc ription of Participants, Desc riptive Demog raphic s, Finding s Related to the Hy pothesis, and Summary . The ANOVA tests and power analy sis are listed in Appendix F. Four teen wome n participa ted in the study . All participants re ceive d a we ekly treatment consisting of the same a cupunctur e treatment and a romather apy that was either true aroma thera py or a pla cebo of spring water . Desc ription of Partic ipan ts Participants in this study were females betwe en the a ges of 22- 49. Thirty -two were initially recruited. Howe ver, two did not pass the initial inclusion/ex clusion criter ia due to pre gnancy . participa nts passed the initial inclusion/ex clusion criter ia and be gan the 6- week prog ram. Ea ch of the 30 participa nts was ra ndomly place d into either Group A or Group B . In the cour se of the tr ial, 16 participa nts 35dropped out of the trial, leaving 14 study participa nts or N = 14. Six were in Group A (receive d the ar omathera py intervention) a nd eig ht were in Group B (receive d the place bo of spring water ). Desc riptive De mographics The pa rticipants in this study were women f rom diverse racial and ethnic backg rounds. Eac h had deliver ed at lea st one child. Ag e was the only demog raphic data c ollected f rom the study participa nts. The mea n ages of both g roups wer e similar, with Group A = 34 and Gr oup B = 33.

The fir st discussion will prese nt results of the Perc eived Stress Sca le (PSS) scores for both gr oups. The scor e conside red he althy for wome n is 13.7, with higher score s reflecting highe r leve ls of stress (Cohen e t al., 1983). A discussion of study finding s from the SF12v2 H ealth Survey Scores f or both g roups is also included. I n this case, a score of 50 is considere d healthy , with lower scor es reflecting poor er qua lity of life and hig her stre ss levels. I n general, then, a de crease in scor e for the PSS and an incre ase in scor e for the SF12v2 He alth Survey is prefe rred and re flects a dec rease in stress levels a nd improved quality of life. Perceived Stre ss Scale Scores The Perc eived Stress Sca le (PSS) is a 10-question survey that measure s the perception of stress. Ea ch question ra nges from 0 to 4 in value. Upon completion of the survey , all items are summed r esulting in a n overa ll PS S score. A lowe r scor e is interpre ted as a reflection of lowe r stress leve ls. The normal va lue for f emales w ith no regard to e thnicity or ag e is 13.7, with a standar d deviation of 6.6 (Cohe n et al., 1983). In pre- trial scoring , both gr oups score d highe r than the nor m for fe males, with Group A ha ving a mean pr etrial PSS score of 29.2 a nd Group B having a mea n pretria l PSS score of 26. I ndividual PS S scores for each participa nt within Group A and Group B are shown in Fig ures 1 a nd 2. After 6 wee ks of wee kly treatments, participants we re asked to respond a gain to the PSS and SF12v2 He alth Survey . In all but two instances, posttrial score s reve aled a reduction in stress levels for both gr oups with Group A (A romather apy) having a 37mean posttrial PSS s core of 18.7 and G roup B (Place bo) having a mea n posttrial PS S score of 19.6. The two instanc es of posttrial scor es remaining the same or inc reasing came from Gr oup B ( Placebo) . All participants in the ar omathera py group experience d reduc tion in st ress leve ls as measure d by the PSS . Figure 1 . Pretrial PSS s cores\u2014Group A ( aroma thera py), n = 6, mea n = 29.2.

Study finding s further reve al that Group A (aromathera py) experienc ed a greater de crease in PSS scores compar ed to Group B (plac ebo). G roup A (aromathera py) went from a mea n score of 29.2 to 18.7 (a 36% reduc tion or decr ease of 10.5 points) versus Gr oup B ( place bo) we nt from a mea n of 26 to 19.6 (a 25% 38reduc tion or decr ease of 6.4 points).

SF12v2 Su rvey Scor es The SF12v2 H ealth Survey is a shorter f orm of the SF36v2 H ealth Survey that uses 12 (ve rsus 36) questions to measure functional he alth and we llbeing. T he SF12v2 Hea lth Survey cover s the same e ight domains a s the SF36v2 He alth Survey : (a) Physical func tioning; r betwe en Gr oups A and B . (e) Vitality ; (f) Socia l functioning ; (g) Role-e motional; and (h) Menta l health. The eight domains are or ganized into two main categ ories: Phy sical He alth and Menta l Health. The SF12v2 He alth Survey scoring system assig ns a scor e for each cate gory ranging from 1 to 50, with scores e qual to or g reater than 45 c onsidered nor mal, or healthy (Ware e t al., 2010). F or purpose s of this study , the SF12v2 He alth Survey score s for e ach pa rticipant we re calculate d by aver aging the score s from the Phy sical Health and Mental He alth cate gories. F or example, if a r espondent scor ed 31 points on the Phy sical He alth cate gory questions and 40 points on the Mental Hea lth categ ory questions, the overa ll SF12v2 Health Survey score for that pa rticipant would be 35.5. In both gr oups, mean ba seline SF12v2 He alth Survey score s (Group A = 39.1 and Gr oup B = 41.5) we re considered w orse than those for the g eneral population (scor e of 45 - 50) and w ere simil ar to the nor ms for individuals diag nosed with depre ssive disorder ( Ware, 2010). T he mea n pretria l SF12v2 score s for pa rticipants in Group A ( aroma thera py) and G roup B (plac ebo) a re presente d in 6 romather apy). Figure 7. Pretrial SF12v2 sc ores Gr oup B ( place bo).

The SF12v2 H ealth Survey score s increa sed for all participa nts in Group A (aromathera py), and f or all but one pa rticipant for Group B (plac ebo). This pa rticipant experience d a dec rease in her SF 12v2 Hea lth Survey score (ID-1246). U pon looking at the trial da ta for pa rticipant I D-1246, it was f ound that the Phy sical He alth subcomponent of he r SF12v2 He alth Survey score had droppe d, there by dropping her overa ll SF12v2 Health Survey score . Specifica lly, the Phy sical He alth portion of her prete st score w as 61 ver sus 41 in her posttest score . Her Mental He alth subcomponent score incre ased, how ever, from a Me ntal Hea lth pretest score of 50 ver sus posttest score of 60. This might sug gest that her me ntal health quality of life improve d during treatment, while she experienc ed a de cline in phy sical hea lth. No other par ticipants experience d a dec rease in SF12v2 He alth Survey score s. Figure 10 shows the compar ative incr ease in mean SF12v2 He alth Survey score s for both g roups. 42Figure 10.

This chapter analy zes the resultant data , offe rs finding s and conc lusions, and provides a disc ussion of the implications for ac tion and rec ommendations for fur ther research. Rese The is: of py is more e ffective in trea ting stre ss levels than ac upuncture alone. The hypothesis was rejected with statistical sig nificanc e not being achie ved ( p > 0.05) in a betwee n group analy sis (2 x 2 mix ed ANO VA) of the PSS score s. Null Hyp othesis The null There stress levels whe is combined with ar omathera py compar ed to ac upuncture alone. The null 47hypothesis was supported by compar ing the results of both g roups over time (2 x 2 m ixed ANO VA) a s measure d by the PSS . Conclusion s The main a im of this st udy was to dete rmine if combining aroma thera py with duces stre ss more than a cupunctur e treatment alone. While the re sults from this study suggest that aroma thera py combined with ac upuncture reduc es stress levels more tha n acupunc ture a lone, statistical signific ance was not ac f or the Perce ever, a sig nificant diff erence w as found be tween groups in the SF12v2 He alth Survey , providing evidenc ture a lone. Fur thermore results from this study confirme d that acupunc ture is one possible treatment to ef fectively reduc e stress. Discussion The hy pothesis of this study proposed that c ombining ar omathera py with acupunc ture is more e ffective that tre atments using a cupunctur e alone in the trea tment of stress. While the aroma thera py group experienc ed greater re duction in stress levels, statistical signif icanc e was not achieve d for the pr imary stress measur ement instrument, the PSS , nificant differ ence betwee n groups was f ound in the quality of life mea surement instrument, SF12v2 Hea lth Survey . There fore, results from this study suggest that aroma thera py combined with ac upuncture is significa ntly more e ffective than a cupunctur e alone in improving pe rceived quality of life. A la rger sample siz e may have de monstrated statistical significa nce a nd more c ompelling r esults. Unfortunate ly, attrition rates for 48participa nts resulted in a drop f rom an orig inal g roup of 30 individuals to a final g roup of 14 individuals with only 6 rec eiving the interve ntion of aromathe rapy rec eiving acupunc ture only . In addition, results may have show n greater sig nificanc e if there had bee n a lar ger and more e qual distribution of participants in ea ch group (f or example 50 in Group A and 50 in Gr oup B ve rsus 6 in Group A a nd 8 in Group B ). Severa l of the studies examined in the pursuit of this project conc luded that more re search is nee ded in the ar eas tha t consider the tr eatments of a cupunctur e and/or aroma L eung Pang , 2011; Shin & L ee, 2007) . At the same time, resea rch on this topic re veale d that while medica l phy sicians want to off er the ir patients more options bey ond presc ribing pharma lated disea ses, they are retice nt to do so without sufficie nt evidence (Anthiere ns et al., 2010). The refore, f urther r esearch is wa rranted. As more r esearch a nd clinical evide nce de monstrate the ople will consider a romather apy and/or a cupunctur e for the trea tment of stress; (b) more health ca re providers sug gest this combined approa ch whe n revie wing treatment options wit h their patients; and ( c) more acupunc turists acupunc ture a nd there by incre ase the efficacy of their treatments. The most signific ant impact of this re search is providing patients with the knowledg e that ar omathera py and ac upuncture , when use d toge ther, may effectively reduc e stress leve ls. Som e possible bene fits of the propose d approa ch in this study 49are a reduction of sy mptoms and a possible reduc ed nee d for pha rmac euticals, less exposure to side eff ects, a nd a re duction in health ca re costs. Strengths of the Stud y The re sults of this s tudy suggest a fe w streng ths worth considering . Because the study participa nts repre sent a hig hly stressed population, with base line stress levels measuring out of the ra nge conside red nor mal, this study offers one powe rful wa y to reduc e stress in their lives. A se cond streng th is that the acupunc ture point protocol used in this study was c onfirmed to re duce stre ss levels. This second point is important beca use it validates finding s from pre vious studies (Eshkevar i et al., 2012; Howar eung Pang , 2011; ucas, 2011) the ability to reduc e, sig nificantly , by mace utical trea tments. The final streng th of the study is the instrumentation used to measure stress. B oth the PSS and SF12v2 Hea lth Survey are widely used asse ssment tools used to measure stre ss levels and quality of life sc ores. Employ ing pr eviously tested and va lidated tools in the assessment of stre ss reduc tion is i mportant, bec ause stre ss is a difficult conc ept to define , study , and mea sure ( Cohen et al., 1983; Ka rpen, 1996) . Limit ations of the Study One major limit ation of the study was its small sample siz e. Patient attrition limit ed the a mount of data. The study 's 6-we ek dura tion also proved to be a limit ation. Perhaps a shorter timefr ame of 4 wee ks rather 6 six weeks may have decreased the number of participa nts being dropped f rom the study . Lastly, the trial desig n of re quiring participa nts to attend all six of the we ekly treatments may have 50also bee n a limitation. Allowing par ticipants to skip one treatment may have f urther reduc ed over all attrition. Recommendations f or Future Re searc h Results from this pil ot study offer nine re commendations for future r esearch: 1.Study Desig n\u2014Sample Siz e. The first rec ommendation would be to start with a larg er sample siz e. It is believed that a la rger sample siz e with n > 30 would pre sent strong er results. 2.Study Desig n\u2014Trial L ength. Due to conve nience , prior re search, and clinical experienc e, this study was de signe d to last 6 weeks. A shor ter trial duration of 4 we eks is rec ommended and ma y addre ss participant a ttrition. An alter native possibility to reduc ing tr ial leng th is allowing pa rticipants to miss one treatment in the 6-w eek tr ial. Howeve r, a more flexibl e policy for participa tion Desig n\u2014Male Participa nts. rom an addic tion recove ry cente r. No men pa rticipated in this study . Adding men to the g roup of pa rticipants would be a n even mor e powe rful wa y to deter mine trea tment effic acy betwee n gender using on stre ss reduc tion have included ma le and f emale pa rticipants (L uine, B eck, Bow man, Fr ankfur t, & Ma clusky , 2007). Of pa rticular me rit are the differ entiated g arnered responses. F or example, L uine et al. ( 2007) found that chronic stress re duces a nxiety in male ra ts and incre tion. Many other populations experienc e high stre ss levels. For example, students may be a g roup worth study ing because of their context-specific stre ss levels and lar ge population count (Herz, 2009; S eo, 2009). H ealthca re practitioners a nd car e provide rs are another highly stressed population (A PA, 2013; Griffith et al., 2008; Kemper et al., 2011). I n both of these e xamples, it would be usef ul to know if combining aroma thera py ture is an e ffective, n\u2014Aromathe method of aroma thera py was used in this trial. Specific ally, a blend of aroma thera py suspended in spring water was spra yed onto a c otton ball and place d below participa nts' noses while re ceiving acupunc ture tre atments ly ing in the supine position. Other studies used diffe rent methods whe n delivering aroma thera py as par t of a tre atment. For example, Moss et al. (2008) plac ed participa nts in a 2.4m long x 1.8m wide x 2.4m high testing cubicle a nd secur an a romather apy diffuser under the participa nt's seat. This may be an appr oach w orth consider ing be cause the primary investiga tor and research assistants would not see the a romather apy delivery device . Use of persona l inhalers conta ining a romather apy may be anothe r effective delivery system beca use it would ensure blinding of the primary investiga tor and re search assistants, as we ll as offe r more e xposure to the a romather apy (Varney & . 526.Study Desig n\u2014Blinding Method. Kiec olt-Glaser et al. (2008) require d the primary investiga tor and re search assistants to wea r surg ical masks to preve nt potential expos ure to a romather apy and fur ther e nsured blinding in their study . 7.Study O ffering enticing incentives may incre ase participa nt inclusion and decr ease fall out. I deas inc lude a moneta ry reward, a massag e pac kage, and/or free or r educe d price acupunc ture sessions for par ticipants the e ntire study . 8.Potential Researc h\u2014Drug Reduction. I t would be intere sting to study the effects of a cupunctur e combined w ith aromather apy versus a cupunctur e alone in the potential r eduction of me dications. For example, it would be interesting to see if the g roup re ceiving acupunc ture succ reduc ing the need f or pain medic ations than a g roup Conditions. W hile stress re duction was the specific condition studied in thi s trial, acupunc ture a nd aroma thera py have been use independe ntly to treat other conditions such as: hig h blood pressure , pain, anx iety, ht loss. esearch the c ombined use of these modalities may reve al an eve n more powe rful and c onsistent treatment outcome ve l versus Sy nthetic. I n pursuing this project, research from Holmes (1995) suggests that sy nthetic oils do not possess the 53same he aling proper ties as natura l oils. For example, cer tain essential oils have be en prove n to effe ctively treat infection; howeve r, the sy nthetic version could not provide the same e ffects (Holmes, 1995). While an in-depth exploration of this topic is out of the scope for this projec t, it appea rs to be an oppor tunity and re commendation for future r esearch. Implications f or the P rofession The re sults of this s tudy have positive implications for the f ields of TCM, Western medicine, a nd aroma thera acupunc ture incr eases the eff icacy tre atments. Fur ther research on the ef ficacy of combining aroma thera py and ac upuncture when tre ating other c onditions m ay also provide other health pra ctitioners with additional trea tment strateg ies. For example, Western medical pr actitioners may feel more conf ident suggesting acupunc ture a nd/or aroma thera py as one of the viable options worth considering when tre ating stress. In this ag e of c hoice, a nd incre ased se lf-involvement with hea lth care decisions, patients are looking f or more options to addre ss their ac ute and c hronic c onditions. Providing them with knowledg e about the pote ntial benef its of a combined a pproac h utiliz ing a cupunctur e and a romather apy may well be the noninva sive, cost-e ffective treatment option they are seeking in an eve r eme rging se a of he (APA).
