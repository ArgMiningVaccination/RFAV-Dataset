In this installment of a larger five-year plan, the Department expects to award a total of $85,000,000 to states and territories to increase their ability to serve, improve, and strategically expand the National Apprenticeship system. Of the available funds, the Department intends to award up to $40,000,000 through 54 formula-funded base grants, also referred to as the Base Formula Funding in this Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA). (See Appendix B for more information for the formula calculation.) The Department will also award an additional $45,000,000 through competitive funds, also referred to as Competitive Funding in this FOA, to those eligible applicants seeking to receive a combination of both Base Formula Funding and Competitive Funding. Competitive funds will be awarded through 8-10 grants, with individual grants ranging from $1,000,000 up to $6,000,000. In order to receive Competitive Funding, applicants must submit applications for both Base Formula Funding and Competitive Funding. All applicants responding to this FOA are required, at minimum, to submit an application for the Base Formula Funding. For more information on applying for the Base Formula Funding, please see Appendix A. The Department intends to issue amendments to this Funding Opportunity Announcement in future years to provide additional funding annually dependent on the availability of funds. On February 17, 2021, President Biden reaffirmed his commitment to expand the Registered Apprenticeship system, which includes Registered Apprenticeship Programs (hereinafter referred to as RAPs) and pre-apprenticeship programs leading to RAPs, to reward work, rebuild the middle-class, and connect a diverse workforce to family-supporting, living wage jobs. The President called for the jobs created by rebuilding America's infrastructure to be filled by diverse, local, well-trained workers who have the free and fair choice to join a union. This starts by expanding the Registered Apprenticeship system and investing in pipelines into Registered Apprenticeship Programs. Later that year, the President issued Executive Orders 14031, 14045, 14049, 14050, and 14075, highlighting and vowing to address the systemic barriers to equity, justice, education, excellence, economic opportunity, and equality faced by the Asian American, Native Hawaiian, Pacific Islander, Hispanic and Latino, Native American, Black American, and LGBTQI+ populations. Page 3 of 65 President Biden underscored the need for a shared commitment between industries, including labor organizations, and the federal government to restore the country from the pandemic and ensure that \"the future of America is made in America, by American workers.\" With the \"earn- while-you-learn\" model, which acknowledges employers as the drivers of their hiring and training, RAPs are uniquely situated to remove barriers to economic opportunity and bring the potential for predictable and stable living wages to all members of their local communities. Assisting new and emerging industries by establishing RAPs contributes to a long-term hiring strategy for businesses that will promote prosperity and sustainability, regardless of where they are located. The Department's goals for the SAEF Grant program are threefold: 1) Help states and territories advance the Registered Apprenticeship system as a workforce development strategy and post-secondary education career pathway that maintains the nation's strong, adaptable, and highly skilled workforce. 2) Support integrated, statewide Registered Apprenticeship strategies and state and territory capacity to engage industry and meet the demand for new programs in both traditional and non-traditional industries, such as the Care Economy (Healthcare, Childcare, Home Care, etc.), Climate/Clean Energy, Public Sector, Educational Services (K-12 Teachers), Technology/Cybersecurity, Transportation, Hospitality, and the Supply Chain (logistics, warehouse, transportation, and manufacturing, including but not limited to the manufacturing of semi-conductors and biomanufacturing). 3) Allow states and territories to build capacity to significantly increase Registered Apprenticeship opportunities for all American workers, particularly underrepresented populations, including women, people of color, and individuals with disabilities, and underserved communities, including veterans, justice-impacted individuals, youth, and those in rural communities, and to take steps to facilitate their successful start and completion of RAPs. As a key partner within the National Apprenticeship system, states and territories are uniquely qualified to support the Administration's priority goals of expanding, modernizing, and diversifying Registered Apprenticeship, ultimately leading to good jobs, good wages, and strong career pathways. The Base Formula Funding option will have a grant Period of Performance (POP) of 12 months, and the Competitive Funding option will have a grant POP of 36 months. The Department intends this annual investment plan to form the basis of a longer-term strategic investment plan. Subject to available funds, the Department is committed to awarding annual Base Formula Funding (based on a formula and dependent on availability) and providing opportunities for states and territories to apply for Competitive Funding on a yearly basis. Continuation of funding to grantees is subject to the discretion of DOL and contingent upon the availability of funds, satisfactory progress of the grantee's project, and adequate stewardship of federal funds. As appropriated funding for Registered Apprenticeship has grown each year since 2016, the Department strongly believes that consistency and reliability of federal support is critical to the sustained growth, diversification, and modernization of the National Apprenticeship system. Eligible entities are states, as defined in 29 CFR Section 29.2. The term \"State\" means \"any of the 50 States of the United States, District of Columbia, or any Territory or possession of the Page 4 of 65 United States.\" For the purposes of this FOA, the eligible 54 U.S. States and territories include all 50 States of the United States, the District of Columbia, and territories whose Active Apprentices exceeds 100 apprentices, i.e., Guam, Puerto Rico, and American Samoa. Only territories with more than 100 registered apprentices (as of FY 22 data) are eligible to apply for Base and Competitive funds. For those territories not eligible to apply under this FOA (i.e., have fewer than 100 registered apprentices), OA will provide dedicated technical assistance to increase their capacity to apply for future year funding, contingent upon the availability of such funds. Please see Section III.A Eligible Applicants. To view the Office of Apprenticeship's FY 2022 Data and Statistics, please visit https://www.apprenticeship.gov/data-and-statistics . I. FUNDING OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION A. PROGRAM PURPOSE This announcement solicits applications for the SAEF grant program. As part of a five-year investment plan, the Department is providing funding, through the SAEF grant program, for States to support State capacity and State planning to create new and expand existing RAPs while also driving system innovation and reform. Subject to available funding, the Department intends to provide, on an on-going basis, an annual formula-funded base grant to all States that apply and that meet application requirements, as well as an opportunity for States to apply for additional Competitive Funding annually. States may apply for an annual Base Formula grant and Competitive Funding, contingent upon funding remaining available over the next five years. For States that receive Competitive Funding, they may only receive that funding once during the five-year investment planning cycle. Continuation of Base Formula Funding to grantees is subject to the discretion of DOL and contingent upon the availability of funds, satisfactory progress of the grantee's project, and adequate stewardship of federal funds. Applicants will have two options when applying for this grant program: 1. Base Formula Funding. Applicants may choose to apply for the Base Formula Funding, as described in Appendix A. Base Formula Funding amounts are specified in Appendix B. 2. Base Formula Funding, as well as Competitive Funding up to $6 million. Those responsive applicants that are not selected for the Competitive Funding will receive only the Base Formula Funding. Further, applicants that only apply for Competitive Funding but do not apply for Base Formula funding will be found nonresponsive. If applicants are not selected for Competitive Funding in one funding cycle, applicants are encouraged to re-apply for Competitive Funding in future cycles under this grant program. Subject to available funding, it is the Department's intent to provide an opportunity to apply for Base Formula Funding option for all eligible applicants under this grant program over five years, and the Competitive Funding option to the highest scoring applicants under this grant program. Applicants must submit one abstract for the Base Formula Funding option, and, if applicable, an additional, second abstract for the Competitive Funding option. Applicants must complete and submit the appropriate abstract(s) for their application (see Appendix C). Please make note of the Funding Option in each abstract. Every State applying for a grant under this FOA that meets the application requirements, as described in Appendix A, will receive a base amount of formula funding, as described in Page 5 of 65 Appendix B, to engage in activities to strengthen the structures supporting RAPs in their State. For Base Formula Funding allowable activities, please refer to Appendix A. As a result of this Funding Opportunity, depending on availability of funding in subsequent years, States may receive base funds annually, for up to four more years from the start of the grant period of performance, provided their performance and expenditures of the previous year support additional funding. Each State has their own unique demographics, and each State must provide pertinent data to show and consider shortages and/or saturation in occupations. DOL wants to ensure States receive appropriate funding and resources to build up and expand their Registered Apprenticeship ecosystem. After each year, if DOL determines that a State qualifies for new Base Formula Funding, based on their growth/outcomes, they will automatically receive additional Base Formula Funding based on that year's formula, if they wish to receive Base Formula Funding again and provided funds are available. DOL will publish new Base Formula Funding amounts annually, contingent upon such funding being available, prior to future awards being made. States that wish to only apply for the Base Formula Funding should refer to Appendices A and B for additional information on the Project Narrative requirements, allowable activities, and the Base Formula Funding amounts. Section IV.B.3. Project Narrative is only applicable to applicants wishing to apply for the Competitive Funding. States must submit separate SF-424, SF-424A, and Budget Narrative for the Base Formula Funding and Competitive Funding, if applicable. Applicants must submit one abstract for the Base Formula Funding option, and, if applicable, an additional, second abstract for the Competitive Funding Option. PROGRAM DESIGN The SAEF grant will expand opportunities in RAPs, as well as pre-apprenticeships that lead to RAPs. While grantees and their strategies will be diverse, within each State, they will share a set of common design elements. These common design elements include the requirements for RAPs, the quality framework for pre-apprenticeship programs, and cross-cutting principles. A. Registered Apprenticeship Programs RAPs are a proven model of job preparation, validated by DOL or a DOL-recognized State Apprenticeship Agency (SAA), which combine paid on-the-job learning (OJL) with related instruction (RI) to progressively increase workers' skill levels and wages. RAPs are also a business-driven model that provide an effective way for employers to recruit, train, and retain highly skilled workers. RAPs allow workforce partners, educators, and employers to develop and apply industry standards to training programs, thereby increasing the quality and productivity of the workforce. RAPs offer job seekers immediate employment opportunities that pay sustainable wages and offer advancement along a career path as they complete their training. Graduates of RAPs receive nationally recognized, portable credentials, and their training may be applied toward further post-secondary education. RAPs are authorized through regulations issued under the National Apprenticeship Act of 1937 (29 U.S.C. 50 et seq.), which are located at 29 C.F.R. Parts 29 and 30. The Office of Apprenticeship (OA), in conjunction with SAAs, registers programs for federal purposes, ensures that RAPs meet applicable federal and State laws and regulations covering RAPs, issues certificates of completion to apprentices, encourages the development of new programs through Page 6 of 65 outreach and technical assistance, protects the safety and welfare of apprentices, and ensures equal employment opportunity for apprentices. Applicants may refer to https://www.apprenticeship.gov/employers/registered-apprenticeship- program for more information on the key elements of a RAP. B. Quality Pre-apprenticeship Programs A pre-apprenticeship program is defined as a set of strategies designed to prepare individuals for entry into a RAP. Pre-apprenticeship programs differ from internships, job shadowing, externships, and co-ops, which may also offer individuals an opportunity to experience firsthand a profession or practice, but do not always engage in \"real world\" experiential learning. For the purposes of this FOA, pre-apprenticeship programs must include the following five elements to be considered a quality pre-apprenticeship program: Designed in Collaboration with RAP Sponsors. Quality pre-apprenticeship programs are designed by organizations with input from a RAP sponsor. A pre-apprenticeship program's educational and pre-vocational services prepare individuals to meet the entry requisites of one or more RAPs. They have training goals to teach participants a defined set of skills required and agreed upon by the RAP sponsor for entry into their programs. The start date and length of specific pre-apprenticeship programs may vary. Ideally, pre- apprenticeship programs provide an industry-recognized credential and stipends or wages. Meaningful Hands-on Training that Does Not Displace Paid Employees. Quality pre- apprenticeship programs provide hands-on training to individuals in 1) a workplace, 2) simulated lab experience, or 3) work-based learning environment, and which also do not supplant a paid employee, while accurately simulating the industry and occupational conditions of the partnering RAPs, which includes observing proper supervision and safety protocols. Facilitated Entry and/or Articulation. The purpose of a pre-apprenticeship program is to train individuals for entry into a RAP. A quality pre-apprenticeship program assists in exposing participants to local, State, and national apprenticeship programs and provides direct assistance to participants applying to those programs. When possible, formalized agreements exist with RAPs that enable individuals who have successfully completed the pre-apprenticeship program to enter directly into a RAP. These may also include articulation agreements that allow the individual to earn advanced credit/placement for skills and competencies already acquired. For the purposes of this FOA, pre- apprenticeship programs must lead to enrollment in a RAP. Sustainability through Partnerships. To support the ongoing sustainability of a quality pre-apprenticeship partnership, such partnerships collaboratively promote the use of RAPs as a preferred means for employers to develop a skilled workforce and to create career opportunities and pathways for individuals. Access to Appropriate Supportive Services. Quality pre-apprenticeship programs facilitate access to appropriate supportive services during the program; these supportive services may continue after the participant leaves the pre-apprenticeship program and enters a RAP. Services may include counseling, transportation assistance, childcare, and rehabilitative services, among others. Page 7 of 65 For more information on quality pre-apprenticeship programs or any subsequent information issued by the Department, please visit https://www.dol.gov/agencies/eta/advisories/training-and- employment-notice-no-13-12 . C. Cross-cutting Principles SAEF grants, i.e., Base Formula Funding and/or Competitive Funding, will incorporate the following cross-cutting principles into their projects to support the Administration's goal of ensuring quality jobs for all workers: Equity. Focus on diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility in existing programs, as well as expansion of the RAP model to new industries to improve outcomes for workers who have historically not had access to the model. DOL recognizes that expanding access, equity, and career awareness to increase participation of underrepresented populations (which may include women, people of color, individuals with disabilities, as established in 29 CFR Part 30, where that population's participation in RAPs is significantly less than would be reasonably expected given the availability of such individuals for apprenticeship in the relevant industry, occupation, or recruitment area) and underserved communities (including veterans, justice-impacted individuals, youth, and those in rural communities) will be critical to advance registered apprenticeships. Good Jobs/Fair Labor standards. Registered Apprenticeships, by design, are good jobs, providing good starting wages and a progressive wage increase, as well as creating pathways to long-term careers and opportunities for higher education. These grants will focus on in-demand occupations and industries that provide good-quality jobs that pay living wages in a safe and healthy workplace, with a particular emphasis on those critical industries and occupations defined by the Administration. Support for high-quality, sustainable programs. Focus on ensuring that all RAPs have the features of high-quality apprenticeships and that efforts support a broader workforce development agenda to support a sustainable apprenticeship system on a national scale. New opportunities for innovation, engagement, and ease of access. Focus on innovative strategies that support the expansion and modernization of Registered Apprenticeship by: engaging with new and underrepresented organizations in the apprenticeship system (such as Historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs), Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs), small businesses, etc.); RAP development; creating and increasing access to apprenticeship opportunities for underrepresented populations and underserved populations; developing distance learning approaches; and leveraging technology to provide technical assistance, increase ease of access, remove barriers, and improve system alignment. PROGRAM GOALS For both the Base Formula Funding and Competitive Funding, this grant program will promote the development of new and/or the expansion of existing RAPs and occupations across a diverse group of industries, which can include those industries/occupations in which the Administration is particularly interested. Applicants can propose to target any industry, based on demand and local Labor Market Information (LMI). The Department is particularly interested in the following industries: Educational Services (K-12 Teachers), Care Economy (Healthcare, Childcare, Home Care etc.), Page 8 of 65 Climate/Clean Energy, Public Sector, Technology/Cybersecurity, Transportation, Hospitality, and the Supply Chain (logistics, warehouse, transportation, and manufacturing, including but not limited to the manufacturing of semi-conductors and biomanufacturing). The Department is also interested in projects that demonstrate a commitment to environmental sustainability, environmental justice, or a just transition (i.e., supporting and committing to a decent-job-creating net-zero-carbon-emission economy), such as by adhering to green building practices, training in green construction practices, or otherwise demonstration of climate-friendly sustainability practices. Activities will support the building and nurturing of partnerships with new and emerging industry partners, to include labor organizations, that lead to stable, safe, good-paying jobs that allow workers the free and fair opportunity to organize. Additionally, the Department is committed to maximizing the impact of its funds in improving the working conditions of American workers. Through the Biden Administration's Good Jobs Initiative, the Department and the Department of Commerce have published the Good Jobs Principles, a shared vision of the core elements of a Good Job. In addressing job quality in their applications, applicants must do so in light of the job quality features described in the Principles, which can be found here. For the Competitive Funding, ETA will prioritize funding for projects that propose to target industries in which the Administration is particularly interested: Educational Services (K-12 Teachers), Care Economy (Healthcare, Childcare, Home Care, etc.), Climate/Clean Energy, Public Sector, Technology/Cybersecurity, Transportation, Hospitality, and the Supply Chain (logistics, warehouse, transportation, and manufacturing, including but not limited to the manufacturing of semi-conductors and biomanufacturing). For applicants proposing to develop K-12 Teacher RAPs, it will be important to incorporate a wide range of partners that also include practitioner buy-in and teacher voice in the development of these RAPs. Further, key Registered Apprenticeship partners and engagements should include State Education Agencies (SEAs) and Local Education Agencies (LEAs), incorporating state licensing requirements; organized labor or representation of teacher voice; related technical instruction provider; and state or local workforce boards for supportive services. PROGRAM ACTIVITIES Applicants must serve a statewide geographic scope. The geographic scope is the physical service area in which awarded applicants will serve participants. In addition to grant funded activities listed in Appendix A Base Formula Funding, States applying for the Competitive Funding will also select relevant activities that build sustainability and substantially increase the total number and diversity of Registered Apprentices and RAPs within their State. Activities proposed for the Competitive Funding portion must build and expand on activities identified in Base Formula Funding proposals. For States applying for the Competitive Funding, applicants must select two program activities below, in addition to the five-year plan as required for Base Formula Funding, which is a required activity for all applicants. A five-year plan is a required activity for all applicants. Please ensure that your five-year plan for the Competitive Funding option builds upon the five-year plan for the Base Formula Funding option. For this first round of funding, applicants may submit a preliminary version, and within Page 9 of 65 120 days of grant award, grantees must submit their final, detailed plan. Please refer to the guidelines below for more details on the five-year plan. Competitive Funding will be targeted to those States with immediate readiness to adopt multiple innovative research- and evidence-based elements that drive equity in Registered Apprenticeship, as well as the capacity to expend additional funding. States must have the ability to provide evidence of robust plans for DEIA and workforce system alignment. For the purposes of this FOA, DEIA and workforce system alignment refers to the alignment of the workforce, education, and the National Apprenticeship system. System alignment should also focus on RAP and/or pre-apprenticeship efforts in support of IIJA, CHIPS Act, and IRA implementation and/or targeting industries in which the Administration is particularly interested, such as, educational services (K-12 teachers), hospitality, care economy (Healthcare, Childcare, etc.), climate/clean energy, public sector, and/or occupations in the Supply Chain sector (logistics, warehouse, transportation, and manufacturing, including but not limited to the manufacturing of semi-conductors and biomanufacturing). Robust plans should also include strategizing and implementing employer engagement methodologies to increase RAP adoption for in-demand industries and occupations within the State; conducting internal assessments as the basis of continuous improvement (i.e., improving time frame for registering new programs); and committing to data sharing, system change, and governance requirements to comply with the law and ensure a strong and modernized Registered Apprenticeship system. The five-year plan must include the following: 1. Be designed to include elements that address DEIA, workforce system alignment, and RAP and/or pre-apprenticeship leading to enrollment in a RAP. 2. Consider the State population distribution and how the State can better serve its underrepresented populations and communities. 3. Describe how pipelines to opportunities across industries will be built and how the State intends to reach new and emerging industries and occupational sectors, and how States will build buy-in from stakeholders. 4. Include a detailed description of the first year of activity, charting out quarterly milestones. Subsequent years can be less detailed, providing bi-annual milestones. When an applicant applies for subsequent rounds of funding, they will expand on the details of that year in their plan. This plan will be used to measure States' progress, which will affect future funding decisions. The intent of the five-year plan is to have States strategically think about how they will use subsequent years' funding to build on and improve their current activities, accomplishments, and goals. Should Congress appropriate additional funds for this purpose, we may consider up to four additional rounds of continuation awards under this solicitation. Applicants will assess and revise, as necessary, their five-year plan in future rounds of funding for this grant. In addition to the five-year plan, applicants for the Competitive Funding option must plan a project that involves a minimum of two activities from the list below: 1. Provide a range of training services that support individuals, particularly from underrepresented populations and underserved communities, enrolled in a RAP, that may Page 10 of 65 include: Related Instruction reimbursement; OJL reimbursement; development of curricula and standards for apprenticeship; online and technology-based learning; accelerated and competency-based training that integrates academic and occupational skills training; and apprenticeship training costs and other supportive services. 2. Provide incentive funding to employers to support new or expand existing RAPs in targeted industries in which they are serving. 3. Establish statewide intermediaries or hubs to facilitate industry adoption of RAPs. 4. Provide direct funding for a range of pre-apprenticeship programs that lead directly to a RAP. Includes pre-apprenticeship activities that support underrepresented populations and underserved communities and increase opportunities to create career pathways for youth and adults. 5. Expand RAP opportunities for youth (between the ages of 16 and 24). Includes establishing and expanding partnerships that commit to expanding RAPs and/or pre- apprenticeship programs that lead to RAP enrollment for youth through coordination with industry, workforce intermediaries, labor organization, SEAs and LEAs, community colleges, youth-serving and community-based organizations, and other stakeholders. This can also include designing and launching a Civilian Climate Corps RAP targeted towards youth apprentices that can be piloted by youth and Conservation Corps groups. 6. Assist industries in creating RAPs in lower wage, entry level occupations across industries that are critical to the nation, but currently do not provide strong career pathways or credentials that encourage people to stay and grow. 7. Assist employers in creating a forward-thinking, specialized RAP that embraces available technology, targeted at addressing people with health conditions and impairments. 8. Build stronger partnerships with the State and local workforce system. Additionally, consider ways to align and support the jobs required to implement the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), CHIPS and Science Act (CHIPS Act), and the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). This can include working with employers to increase their awareness of Registered Apprenticeship opportunities in the state and identify opportunities for them to join existing RAPs and/or starting new RAPs. ETA will prioritize projects that are focused on the industries in which the Administration is particularly interested, such as educational services (K-12 teachers) that includes teacher voice, hospitality, care economy (Healthcare, Childcare, Home Care, etc.), climate/clean energy, public sector, and/or occupations in the Supply Chain sector (logistics, warehouse, transportation, and manufacturing, including but not limited to the manufacturing of semi-conductors and biomanufacturing). B. PROGRAM AUTHORITY Funding for this opportunity comes from the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2022, Public Law 117-103, Division H, Title I. This appropriation allows the Department to award funds to \"expand opportunities through RAPs only registered under the National Apprenticeship Act.\" This means recipients must spend these funds on activities that will create or assist in the Page 11 of 65 creation of RAPs. This program will support the development of new or the expansion of existing RAPs, as described in 29 CFR Parts 29 and 30. II. AWARD INFORMATION A. AWARD TYPE AND AMOUNT Funding will be provided in the form of a grant. For this first round of funding, we expect availability of approximately $85 million to fund up to 54 grants awarded with Base Formula Funding described in Appendix B and an additional 8-10 grants through the competitive portion of this announcement described above. You may apply for an amount up to the Base Funding amount specified in Appendix B, or the base amount specified in Appendix B plus a ceiling amount of up to $6 million for the competitive portion. Awards made under this Announcement are subject to the availability of federal funds. In the event that additional funds become available, we reserve the right to use such funds to select additional grantees from applications submitted in response to this Announcement. Applicants must submit one project abstract if they are applying for the Base Formula Funding only. Applicants must submit two project abstracts, if they are applying for the Base Formula Funding and the Competitive Funding - one for the Base Formula Funding and one for the Competitive Funding (see Appendix C). The Department reserves the right to change this amount depending on the quantity and quality of applications submitted. B. PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE The period of performance is 12 months with an anticipated start date of 07/01/2023. This performance period includes all necessary implementation and start-up activities. As specified above, the period of performance (POP) for the Base Formula Funding option is 12 months. States that are awarded the Competitive Funding will receive a second grant that will have a grant POP of 36 months. States that are awarded both the Base and Competitive funding options will need to manage their grants to ensure that the Base Formula Funding is expended within 12 months of the award start date and the Competitive Funding is expended within 36 months of the award start date. Should Congress appropriate additional funds for this purpose, we may consider up to four additional rounds of continuation Base Formula Funding and Competitive Funding awards under this solicitation. Continuation funding to grantees is subject to the discretion of DOL and contingent upon the availability of funds, satisfactory progress of the grantee's project, and adequate stewardship of federal funds. The anticipated start date for the first round of funds is 07/01/2023. Subject to available funding, OA plans to award annual Base Formula Funding and Competitive Funding, contingent upon funding remaining available over the next five years. For States that receive Competitive Funding, they may only receive the Competitive Funding once during the five years. Please find below a visual POP calendar: Page 12 of - Round 1^ Competitive Funding - Round 2 Competitive Funding - Round 3 Competitive Funding - Round 4+ Competitive Funding - Round 5+ *States must reapply each year to receive continuous base funding. The funding announcement for the SAEF Base Funding will be announced each year. ^States can only receive one round of Competitive Funding once during the five years of the SAEF POP. States may apply for the Competitive Funding more than once, so if states were not awarded Competitive Funding, they may apply for Competitive Funding in subsequent rounds, subject to the availability of funds and application scores. +Competitive Funding that is awarded to States in Year 4 and Year 5 will be completed beyond the life of the grant. III. ELIGIBILITY INFORMATION A. ELIGIBLE APPLICANTS Eligible entities are States, as defined at 29 CFR Section 29.2. The term \"State\" means \"any of the 50 States of the United States, District of Columbia, or any Territory or possession of the United States.\" For the purposes of this FOA, the eligible 54 U.S. States and territories include all 50 States of the United States, District of Columbia, and territories whose Active Apprentices exceeds 100 apprentices, i.e., Guam, Puerto Rico, and American Samoa. Only territories with more than 100 registered apprentices (as of FY 22 data) are eligible to apply for Base and Competitive funds. For those territories not eligible to apply under this FOA (have less than 100 registered apprentices), OA will provide dedicated technical assistance to increase their capacity to apply for future year funding. To view the Office of Apprenticeship's FY 2022 Data and Statistics, please visit https://www.apprenticeship.gov/data-and-statistics. Page 13 of 65 States (the Governor's Office) must identify the State agency that will be the grant recipient (e.g., State Workforce Agency eligible for funding under Title I of the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA), State Educational Agency, or an SAA). This entity will have sole responsibility for administering the project and will serve as the grant's fiscal agent. For States with federally recognized SAAs and where the SAA is not the State agency that will be the grant recipient, the SAA must be included as a partner. Each State is limited to one individual application for consideration under this opportunity. A letter from the Governor (or chief elected official) must be included in the application to designate the Agency authorized to submit the State's application. The Governor or another chief elected official must provide a commitment letter demonstrating the State's commitment to this grant effort. The letter must: 1. Designate the State agency to be the recipient of the award (e.g., State Workforce Agency eligible for funding under Title I of WIOA, State Educational Agency, or an SAA). For states with federally recognized SAAs and where the SAA is not the State agency that will be the grant recipient, the SAA must be included as a partner. For states that do not have a federally recognized SAA, the State must commit to work in partnership with the federal Office of Apprenticeship within the State. 2. Describe specifically how the Governor or chief elected official plans to support the expansion of quality and innovative RAPs being developed or expanded. Applications that do not include this letter with their application will be considered incomplete and will not move forward through the merit review process. If more than one application is received from a State, the one including the designation from the Governor (or chief elected official) will be considered the eligible entity. If more than one application is received from a State and no Governor's letter (or letter from the chief elected official) is included with each application, or more than one application is received from a State and a Governor's letter is included with each application, ETA, in consultation with the Governor (or chief elected official), will make the determination of which agency will receive the award. If we receive multiple applications from the same State agency, we will only consider the most recently received application that meets the deadline. No more than one award per State will be executed. This letter from the Governor must be submitted as an attachment and clearly labeled as \"Governor's Letter.\" If the applicant does not submit the letter, the application will be considered incomplete and non-responsive, and it will not move forward through the merit review process. This Letter is only required for states as defined in III.A. Please place under Required Attachments and add a heading called, \"A letter from the governor or chief elected official.\" Letters sent separate from the application will not be considered. Subject to available funds, OA intends to allow States to apply and receive funding for Competitive Funding once over the course of five years. States may apply for the Competitive Funding option each year; however, States may only receive Competitive Funding once under this five-year solicitation. Base Formula Funding will be awarded on an annual basis with a POP of one year, subject to funding availability, level of implementation of this project, and expenditure of SAEF funds in the prior year(s). Subsequent years of Base Formula Funding is not guaranteed. Future rounds of this FOA are anticipated. If States do not apply this year, they will not be precluded applying for this funding in future years. Page 14 of 65 B. COST SHARING OR MATCHING This program does not require cost sharing or matching funds. Including such funds is not one of the application screening criteria and applications that include any form of cost sharing or match will not receive additional consideration during the review process. Instead, the agency considers any resources contributed to the project beyond the funds provided by the agency as leveraged resources. Section IV.B.2 provides more information on leveraged resources. C. OTHER INFORMATION 1.

If we receive multiple applications from the same organization, we will consider only the most recently received We will consider only one application from each organization which will include the required documents for Base Formula Funding and, if applicable, Competitive Funding. If we receive multiple applications from the same organization, we will consider only the most recently received. 3. Eligible Participants For the purposes of this program, eligible participants are persons 16 years of age and older who receive a direct grant-funded service. To encourage active apprentices to stay in their program and increase retention, grant funds may be used for registered apprentices already enrolled in a RAP. The purpose of these funds is to support new apprentices, new opportunities, retention of registered apprentices, and apprentice completion of a RAP. Page 16 of 65 Participants may be directly served with grant funds under the Base Formula Funding option. However, targets for participants served will not be required for Base Formula Funding. Applicants must set targets for Participant and Apprentice Outcomes and Expanding Registered Apprenticeship Program Outputs for the Competitive Funding option. Please see Section IV.B.3.b Expected Outcomes and Outputs and Appendix D Suggested Performance Outcomes and Outputs Table. If applicants select activities that do not directly result in Participant Outcomes or Program Outputs, they must propose targets related to their proposed activities. For the purposes of the SAEF FOA, reportable individuals are not participants. A \"reportable individual\" is 1) an individual that has been impacted by the development or expansion of a grant-funded registered apprenticeship program; and 2) is enrolled in a RAP; and 3) is at least 16 years old. This individual is enrolled in a RAP that was developed or expanded with grant funds and is, therefore, impacted by the grant, but does not receive a direct, grant-funded participant- level service. For the purposes of this FOA, the target under \"Participant and Apprentice Outcomes\" entitled \"Total number of individuals enrolled in a RAP that was developed using SAEF grant funds\" is the target for reportable individuals. For reporting purposes, participants as well as reportable individuals are reported into WIPS. Among the individuals eligible to receive services, the Department is particularly interested in the following groups: 1. Unemployed workers: For the purposes of this FOA, we define \"unemployed worker\" as individual who is without a job and who wants and is available to work. This can include the long-term unemployed, such as individuals who have been unemployed for six months or more, and youth who have dropped out of school and are seeking their first full-time job. 2. Dislocated workers: For the purposes of this FOA, this term refers to individuals who were terminated or laid-off or have received a notice of termination or lay-off from employment, or were self-employed but are now unemployed. 3. Incumbent workers: For the purposes of this FOA, incumbent workers are individuals already employed with a registered apprenticeship program sponsor before program enrollment, but who need training to upgrade their skills, advance in their careers, or retain their current position in apprenticeship occupations and industries. To qualify as an incumbent worker, an individual must have an established and documented employment history with the employer for six months or more. 4. Underemployed workers: This term refers to individuals who are not currently connected to a full-time job commensurate with the individual's level of education, skills, or wage and/or salary earned previously, or who have obtained only episodic, short-term, or part- time employment. The RAPs must include components that will assist those who do not have particular educational prerequisites and/or experience. You may also propose projects that could include some services for individuals who do not fall into one of the four targeted categories listed above, as long as services for these individuals align with the primary intent and focus of the proposed project and support placement into a RAP within the grant period of performance. While this is permissible, you may only provide services to a limited number of individuals who do not fall into one of the four targeted categories listed above, and that your project must still primarily focus on providing services to workers in one or more of those four targeted categories. Page 17 of 65 Veterans' Priority for Participants 38 U.S.C. 4215 requires grantees to provide priority of service to veterans and spouses of certain veterans for the receipt of employment, training, and placement services in any job training program directly funded, in whole or in part, by DOL. The regulations implementing this priority of service are at 20 CFR Part 1010. In circumstances where a grant recipient must choose between two qualified candidates for a service, one of whom is a veteran or eligible spouse, the veterans' priority of service provisions require that the grant recipient give the veteran or eligible spouse priority of service by first providing him or her that service. To obtain priority of service, a veteran or spouse must meet the program's eligibility requirements. Grantees must comply with DOL guidance on veterans' priority. ETA's Training and Employment Guidance Letter (TEGL) No. 10-09 (issued November 10, 2009) provides guidance on implementing priority of service for veterans and eligible spouses in all qualified job training programs funded in whole or in part by DOL. TEGL No. 10-09 is available at https://www.dol.gov/agencies/eta/advisories/training- and-employment-guidance-letter-no-10-09 . IV. APPLICATION AND SUBMISSION INFORMATION A. HOW TO OBTAIN AN APPLICATION PACKAGE This FOA, found at www.Grants.gov and https://www.dol.gov/agencies/eta/grants/apply/find- opportunities contains all of the information and links to forms needed to apply for grant funding. B. CONTENT AND FORM OF APPLICATION SUBMISSION Applications submitted in response to this FOA must consist of four separate and distinct parts: 1. SF-424, \"Application for Federal Assistance\"; 2. Project Budget, composed of the SF-424A and Budget Narrative; 3. Project Narrative; and 4. Attachments to the Project Narrative. You must ensure that the funding amount requested is consistent across all parts and sub-parts of the application. 1. SF-424, \"Application for Federal Assistance\" You must complete the SF-424, \"Application for Federal Assistance\" (available at https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/forms/sf-424-family.html#sortby=1 ). In the address field, fill out the nine-digit (plus hyphen) zip code. Nine-digit zip codes can be looked up on the USPS website at https://tools.usps.com/go/ZipLookupAction!input.action . The organization's legal name on the SF-424 should match its name registered in the System for Award Management at www.sam.gov . The SF-424 must clearly identify the applicant and must be signed by an individual with authority to enter into a grant agreement. Upon confirmation of an award, the individual Page 18 of 65 signing the SF-424 on behalf of the applicant is considered the Authorized Representative of the applicant. As stated in block 21 of the SF-424 form, the signature of the Authorized Representative on the SF-424 certifies that the organization is in compliance with the Assurances and Certifications form SF-424B (available at https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/forms/sf-424-family.html#sortby=1 ). You do not need to submit the SF-424B with the application. a. Requirement for Unique Entity Identifier All applicants for federal grant funding must have a Unique Entity Identifier (UEI) and must supply their UEI on the SF-424. The UEI is a 12-character (alpha-numeric) code that uniquely identifies all entities. Any entity registering to do business with the government is required to have one. UEIs are issued by SAM.gov and are a part of an entity's record in the Entity Information section of SAM.gov. If you do not have a UEI, you can get one for free at https://sam.gov . Grant recipients authorized to make subawards must meet these requirements related to UEI: Grant recipients must notify potential subawardees that no entity may receive a subaward unless the entity has provided its UEI. Grant recipients may not make a subaward to an entity unless the entity has provided its UEI. (See Appendix A to 2 CFR Part 25.) b. Requirement for Registration with SAM Applicants must register with the System for Award Management (SAM) before submitting an application. Find instructions for registering with SAM at https://www.sam.gov . A recipient must maintain an active SAM registration with current information at all times during which it has an active federal award or an application under consideration. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the applicant is required to review and update the registration at least every 12 months from the date of initial registration or subsequently update its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate, and complete. For purposes of this paragraph, the applicant is the entity that meets the eligibility criteria and has the legal authority to apply and to receive the award. If an applicant has not fully complied with these requirements by the time the Grant Officer is ready to make a federal award, the Grant Officer may determine that the applicant is not qualified to receive a federal award and use that determination as a basis for making a federal award to another applicant. 2. Project Budget You must complete the SF-424A Budget Information Form (available at https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/forms/sf-424-family.html#sortby=1 ). In preparing the Budget Information Form, you must provide a concise narrative explanation to support the budget request, explained in detail below. a. Budget Narrative The Budget Narrative must provide a description of costs associated with each line item on the SF-424A . The Budget Narrative should also include a section describing any leveraged Page 19 of 65 resources provided (as applicable) to support grant activities. Leveraged resources are all resources, both cash and in-kind, in excess of this award. Valuation of leveraged resources follows the same requirements as match. Applicants are encouraged to leverage resources to increase stakeholder investment in the project and broaden the impact of the project itself. Applicants applying for both the Base Formula Funding and Competitive Funding options must submit a Budget Narrative for each funding option. Each category should include the total estimated cost for the period of performance. Use the following guidance for preparing the Budget Narrative. Personnel: List all staff positions by title (including individuals hired by an employment contract) including the roles and responsibilities. For each position give the annual salary, the percentage of time devoted to the project, and the amount of each position's salary funded by the grant. Fringe Benefits: Provide a breakdown of the amounts and percentages that comprise fringe benefit costs such as health insurance, FICA, retirement, etc. Travel: For grantee staff only, specify the purpose, number of staff traveling, mileage, per diem, estimated number of in-state and out-of-state trips, and other estimated costs for each type of travel. Equipment: Identify each item of equipment you expect to purchase that has an estimated acquisition cost of $5,000 or more per unit (or if your capitalization level is less than $5,000, use your capitalization level) and a useful lifetime of more than one year (see 2 CFR Part 200.1 for the definition of Equipment). List the item, quantity, and the unit cost per item. Items with a unit cost of less than $5,000 are supplies, not \"equipment.\" In general, we do not permit the purchase of equipment during the last funded year of the grant. Supplies: Identify the cost of supplies (e.g., general office supplies, desk/chairs, laptops/printers, other specialty items) in the detailed budget per category. Except for general office supplies, list the item, quantity, and the unit cost per item. Supplies include all tangible personal property other than \"equipment\" (see 2 CFR Part 200.1 for the definition of Supplies). Contractual: Under the Contractual line item, delineate contracts and subawards separately. Contracts are defined according to 2 CFR Part 200.1 as a legal instrument by which a non-federal entity purchases property or services needed to carry out the project or program under a federal award. A subaward, defined by 2 CFR Part 200.1 means an award provided by a pass-through entity to a subrecipient for the subrecipient to carry out part of a federal award received by the pass-through entity. It does not include payments to a contractor or payments to an individual that is a beneficiary of a federal program. For each proposed contract and subaward, specify the purpose and activities to be provided, and the estimated cost. Construction: Construction costs are not allowed and this line must be left as zero. Minor alterations to adjust an existing space for grant activities (such as a classroom alteration) may be allowable. We do not consider this as construction and you must show the costs on other appropriate lines such as Contractual. Page 20 of 65 Other: Provide clear and specific detail, including costs, for each item so that we are able to determine whether the costs are necessary, reasonable, and allocable. List items, such as stipends or incentives, not covered elsewhere. Indirect Costs: If you include an amount for indirect costs (through a Negotiated Indirect Cost Rate Agreement or De Minimis) on the SF-424A budget form, then include one of the following: a) If you have a Negotiated Indirect Cost Rate Agreement (NICRA), provide an explanation of how the indirect costs are calculated. This explanation should include which portion of each line item, along with the associated costs, are included in your cost allocation base. Also, provide a current version of the NICRA. or b) If you intend to claim indirect costs using the 10 percent de minimis rate, please confirm that your organization meets the requirements as described in 2 CFR Part 200.414(f). Clearly state that your organization does not have a current negotiated (including provisional) rate, and is not one described in 2 CFR Part 200, Appendix VII(D)(1)(b). Applicants choosing to claim indirect costs using the de minimis rate must use Modified Total Direct Costs (defined by DOL below) as their cost allocation base. Provide an explanation of which portion of each line item, along with the associated costs, are included in your cost allocation base. Note that there are various items not included in the calculation of Modified Total Direct Costs. See the definitions below to assist you in your calculation. Modified Total Direct Cost (MTDC) Definition: To avoid a serious inequity in the distribution of indirect costs, DOL defines MTDC as all direct salaries and wages, applicable fringe benefits, materials and supplies, services, travel, and up to the first $25,000 of each subaward or subcontract (regardless of the period of performance of the subawards or subcontracts under the award). MTDC excludes equipment, capital expenditures, charges for patient care, rental costs, tuition remission, scholarships and fellowships, participant support costs and the portion of each subaward or subcontract in excess of $25,000. o You will also note that participant support costs are not included in modified total direct costs. Participant support costs are defined below. o 2 CFR Part 200.1 Participant Support Cost means direct costs for items such as stipends or subsistence allowances, travel allowances, and registration fees paid to or on behalf of participants or trainees (but not employees) in connection with conferences or training projects. See Section IV.B.4. and Section IV.E.1 for more information. Additionally, the following link contains information regarding the negotiation of Indirect Cost Rates at DOL: https://www.dol.gov/agencies/oasam/centers-offices/office-of-the-senior- procurement-executive/cost-price-determination-division . Indirect-type costs (such as top management salaries, financial oversight, human resources, payroll, personnel, auditing costs, accounting and legal, etc. used for the general oversight Page 21 of 65 and administration of the organization) must not be classified as direct costs ; these types of costs are recovered as part of charging the de minimis or NICRA rate. Note that the SF-424, SF-424A, and Budget Narrative must include the entire federal grant amount requested (not just one year). Do not show leveraged resources on the SF-424 and SF-424A. You should describe leveraged resources in the Budget Narrative. Applicants should list the same requested federal grant amount on the SF-424, SF-424A, and Budget Narrative. If minor inconsistencies are found between the budget amounts specified on the SF-424, SF-424A, and the Budget Narrative, ETA will consider the SF-424 the official funding amount requested. However, if the amount specified on the SF-424 would render the application nonresponsive, the Grant Officer will use his or her discretion to determine whether the intended funding request (and match if applicable) is within the responsive range. 3. Project Narrative See Appendix A for the Base-Formula Funding Project Narrative requirements. Your response to Appendix A will not count against the page limit specified below. The below Project Narrative requirements are only applicable for applicants also applying for the Competitive Funding option. Applicants applying for both the Base Formula Funding and Competitive Funding options must submit a Project Narrative for each funding option. The Project Narrative must demonstrate your capability to implement the grant project in accordance with the provisions of this Announcement. It provides a comprehensive framework and description of all aspects of the proposed project. It must be succinct, self-explanatory, and well-organized so that reviewers can understand the proposed project. The Project Narrative is limited to 20 double-spaced single-sided 8.5 x 11 inch pages with Times New Roman 12-point text font and 1-inch margins. You must number the Project Narrative beginning with page number 1. We will not read or consider any materials beyond the specified page limit in the application review process. The following instructions provide all of the information needed to complete the Project Narrative. Carefully read and consider each section, and include all required information in your Project Narrative. The agency will evaluate the Project Narrative using the evaluation criteria identified in Section V.A. You must use the same section headers identified below for each section of the Project Narrative. a. Statement of Need (Up to 20 Points) 1. Describe in both quantitative and qualitative terms the need for assistance to expand and modernize the Registered Apprenticeship system, including the nature and scope of the problem, and the consequences of not addressing the need, and cite relevant sources for consideration (e.g., Bureau of Labor Statistics, Census Bureau, other DOL sources, etc.). Incorporate demographic data and participant/beneficiary information whenever possible. Page 22 of 65 This includes describing if the proposed project will improve working conditions to expand the availability of Good Jobs for American workers. (Up to 4 Points) a. Where applicable, please describe how addressing this need through your project will improve working conditions to expand the availability of Good Jobs for American workers. In this context, Good Jobs mean those with the characteristics described in the Good Jobs Principles . 2. Identify the industry(ies) and apprenticeable occupation(s) to be targeted through the grant. The Department is particularly interested in expanding RAPs and pre-apprenticeship leading to RAP enrollment in the following industries: Educational Services (K-12 Teachers), Care Economy (Healthcare, Childcare, Home or long-term Care, etc.), Climate/Clean Energy, Public Sector, Technology/Cybersecurity, Transportation, Hospitality, and the Supply Chain (logistics, warehouse, transportation, and manufacturing, including but not limited to the manufacturing of semi-conductors and biomanufacturing). The Department is also interested in expanding into new occupations in traditional RAP industries. For pre-apprenticeship programs, applicants must demonstrate evidence of sufficient demand in a RAP at the completion of a pre-apprenticeship program to support a transition from a pre-apprenticeship to a RAP. Applicants can take into consideration the impacts of any significant events affecting local economies within the geographic scope they intend to serve. In order to receive full points, applicants must identify the new or non- traditional apprenticeship industry(ies) and/or occupation(s) and link evidence to support the need for those occupations. Applicants must cite the source of the evidence, such as the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Census Bureau, other DOL sources, State workforce agencies, employers, or other written labor market information provided by experts in the field. (Up to 6 points) 3. Identify currently active DOL-funded apprenticeship grants, including total award amount and amount unspent. Explain the applicant's plans to ensure appropriate expenditures of current unspent funds while concurrently spending down funds from this grant program. Detail how the applicant is building on work started from past and present OA grant programs. For each OA grant, state the start of the period of performance, end of the period of performance, and expenditure rate for each grant. (Up to 10 points). b. Expected Outcomes and Outputs (Up to 12 Points) Clearly identify the outcome(s) and output(s) that will result from the project. Outcomes are the measurable results of the project. They are the positive benefits or negative changes or measurable characteristics that occur as a result of project activities or outputs. Outputs are tangible products or services that result from the project. Applicants must provide proposed total target numbers for the grant period of performance. Applicants must present their information in a performance measure outcome table (see Appendix D for a sample format) to be included as an attachment to the Project Narrative. If applicants select activities that do not directly result in Participant Outcomes or Program Page 23 of 65 Outputs, they must propose targets related to their proposed activities. These targets will be scored up to 12 points. (1) Participant and Apprentice Outcome 1. Total participants served 2. Total participants who enroll in RAPs 3. Total participants who complete a RAP 4. Total number of participants who enroll in a pre-apprenticeship (as applicable) 5. Total number of participants who complete a pre-apprenticeship (as applicable) 6. Total number of individuals enrolled in a RAP that was developed using SAEF grant funds 7. Total number of individuals enrolled in a pre-apprenticeship that was developed using SAEF grant funds Applicants, who select activities that will directly result in participants, are required to provide yearly outcome targets, included in their performance measure outcomes table. The Department uses these yearly targets to better track performance and provide technical assistance to help grantees meet their outcome goals. Only applicants that most clearly identify the outcomes and outputs that the project is designed to achieve as a direct result of the proposed project will be eligible to receive full points. (Up to 6 points) (2) Program Outputs Applicants, who select activities that will directly result in program creation and expansion, are required to provide targets for the following performance metrics to track the efforts of developing new RAPs and/or expanding existing RAPs, and the rationale for how the target was derived. These targets must be included in the performance measure outcome table in Appendix D discussed above. Applicants must demonstrate their goals are feasible and achievable in order to be eligible to receive full points. Applicants must provide raw numbers for each of the target outcome measures; otherwise, they will not receive full points. Percentages, percent increases, or other types of data projections are not acceptable. (Up to 6 points) 1. Total RAPs created as a result of SAEF grant funding 2. Total RAPs expanded as a result of SAEF grant funding 3. Total pre-apprenticeship programs created as a result of SAEF grant funding (as applicable) 4. Total pre-apprenticeship programs expanded as a result of SAEF grant funding (as applicable) 5. Total number of individuals enrolled in a RAP that was developed using SAEF grant funds 6. Total number of individuals enrolled in a pre-apprenticeship that was developed using SAEF grant funds Outputs are tangible products or services that result from the project. Applicants applying under the Competitive Funding option must incorporate in their explanation the cross-cutting principles of 1) equity, 2) good jobs/fair labor standards, 3) support for high-quality, sustainable programs, Page 24 of 65 and 4) new opportunities for innovation, engagement, and ease of access. Please see section I.A.C. Cross-cutting Principles for more information. c. Project Design (Up to 26 Points) (1) State Work Plan Scoring under this criterion is based on the application identifying and including clear and complete project goals, milestones, key activities, and key partners of the proposed grant project as described in the narrative in the work plan attachment as outlined in Appendix E. This criterion is directly related to the five-year work plan as described under Program Activities in Section I.A. Note: Attachments do not count against page limitation. (Up to 26 points) i. Narrative description that clearly identifies the overall project goals and milestones for developing and/or expanding Registered Apprenticeships, including pre-apprenticeships that lead to Registered Apprenticeships as appropriate, which will result from the apprenticeship project. The narrative description must demonstrate that milestones are feasible based on the project design. To that end, the plan must be very detailed for the applicant's first year of activity, charting out quarterly milestones, and subsequent years may be less detailed, providing bi-annual milestones. The work plan narrative must include all the following: a. Project goals, which are the overarching achievements that will be pursued (up to 2 points) b. Milestones, which are key markers of grant progress; these are typically expressed in the form of an action or event marking a significant change or stage in development (up to 8 points) c. Key Activities, including timeframes for the following (up to 10 points): i. Improving apprenticeship program quality: The State must provide its overall strategy for improving and maintaining apprenticeship program quality. ii.

This must include a detailed organizational chart that identifies the applicant, registered apprenticeship partnership, and other proposed partners, as applicable. The chart must describe the structure of the relationships of all partners involved in the project. The chart must also identify the proposed project's staffing plan to illustrate that partners have the capacity to support the lead applicant to carry out the proposed project. The staffing plan must describe the qualifications and experience of all executive and administrative staff, as well as other personnel such as board members, advisors, and consultants, to fulfill the needs and requirements of the proposed project. Such qualifications and experience must demonstrate the ability to manage a strategic partnership, including fiscal and administrative management, outreach, and promotion. The chart should be included as an attachment to the project narrative and does not count against the 20-page limit. (2) Financial, Data Collection, and Performance Reporting Systems (6 points) Applicants must agree to meet DOL reporting requirements and provide individual record- level data that would be made available for evaluation and national reporting purposes. Please refer to Section VI.C. Applicants must provide a comprehensive description of the existing or planned systems and processes that the applicant will use to provide timely and accurate financial and participant-level performance reporting, including the process for tracking participant-level data on participant characteristics, services, activities, and employment outcomes of registered apprentices served through the project to report to the Page 26 of 65 Department during the life of the grant. In addition, the description must detail how these systems will be used to regularly assess progress towards the identified performance goals and that rigorous performance reporting will be taken into account in staffing and budgeting plans. (3) Sustainability (6 points) Detailed description of a clearly delineated sustainability strategy that includes the following elements: 1. Description of the resources, processes, and methods the program will use to ensure institutional capacity to support the program in the long-term, demonstrating strong potential to continue program activities without future federal funding, including accomplishments or innovations that support a broader workforce development agenda; and 2. Demonstration of plans for the sustainability of partnerships, in particular, those that align with expanding RAP and aligning and coordinating it with other key workforce and education systems. f. Past Performance - Programmatic Capability (Up to 12 Points) 1. Organizations will receive points based on past performance data. Applicants must use the information below and provide the applicable past performance information. There are different instructions depending on your past grant experience. Applicants must use the below information to determine which instructions are applicable to their organization. Applicants that do not have completed grant experience within the past five years as described in the instructions below will not submit a chart and no points will be awarded for this rating factor. Failure to provide a past performance chart will result in zero points awarded for this rating factor. Applicants who have completed an OA grant award within the past five years are required to use the following: Applicants that have completed an OA grant award from the Department within the past five years of the closing date of this announcement will receive points based on past performance demonstrated by the Quarterly Performance Report and Quarterly Financial Report (ETA- 9130). The information below must be provided in a Past Performance Chart as an attachment to the Project Narrative. Applicants who have completed an ETA agreement but not an OA grant award are required to use the following: Applicants that have completed an ETA agreement within the last five years of the closing date of this Announcement must submit past performance for their ETA agreement. The information below must be provided in a Past Performance Chart as an attachment to the Project Narrative. Applicants that have only completed non-ETA assistance agreements (federal or non- federal grants and cooperative agreements but not federal contracts): Applicants that have completed a federally and/or non-federally funded assistance agreement similar in size, scope, and relevance to the proposed project within the last five years of the Page 27 of 65 closing date of this Announcement must provide the information below. The information must be provided in a Past Performance Chart as an attachment to the Project Narrative. Past Performance Chart The Past Performance Chart must include the following information: 1. Grantor name and contact information 2. Project title and grant number 3. Project information/grant objectives 4. Funding amount and project period of performance 5. Number of participants served 6. Population served 7. Performance goals Below is a sample format for the Past Performance Chart. For non-ETA grants, the chart must be signed by the grantor or a letter must be provided from the grantor verifying the past performance data. This letter must be on grantor letterhead and contain contact information for the grantor. Non-ETA applicants that do not provide a signed letter will receive 0 points for f.(1) section. Applicants should use the performance indicators most similar to: i. RAPs created and/or expanded, ii. Number of participants served iii. Number of participants served who enroll in a RAP, and iv. Number of Pre-apprentices who completed a pre-apprenticeship and enrolled in a RAP (if applicable). ETA views the above indicators as the most critical to demonstrating that the applicant's past success in a similar program has prepared its organization to succeed in operating an OA project. Applicants may substitute a different indicator if the substituted indicator is applicable to the outcomes required in this FOA. In the chart, applicants must identify the performance indicators, the goals, and the outcomes. Data for each performance indicator must be displayed as both a fraction (i.e., the numerator equal to the number of program participants who achieved the identified indicator (Outcome) and the denominator equal to the total program participants expected to achieve the identified indicator (Goal) and a percentage. DOL reserves the right to disqualify indicators that are determined not to be sufficiently similar to the indicators above and award zero points for non-qualifying indicators. Applicants will receive points based on past performance demonstrated in the performance chart as follows: 1. Applicants that exceeded at least two performance goals for their most recently completed grant will receive 12 points for this subsection. 2. Applicants that met at least one performance goal and exceeded at least one performance goal for their most recently completed grant will receive 8 points for this subsection. 3. Applicants that met their performance goals for their most recently completed grant will receive 6 points for this subsection. Page 28 of 65 4. Applicants that met one performance goal but did not meet the other performance goal for their most recently completed grant will receive 2 points for this subsection. 5. Applicants that did not meet either performance goal for their most recently completed grant will receive 0 points for this subsection.

(Up to 4 points) iii Whether or not the totals on the SF-424A and the Budget Narrative align. (2 points) 4. Attachments to the Project Narrative In addition to the Project Narrative, you must submit attachments. You must clearly label all attachments. We will exclude only those attachments listed below from the page limit. The Budget and Budget Narrative do not count against the page limit requirements for the Project Narrative. You must not include additional materials such as resum\u00e9s or general letters of support. You must submit your application in one package because documents received separately will be tracked separately and will not be attached to the application for review. Save all files with descriptive file names of 50 characters or fewer and use only standard characters in file names: A-Z, a-z, 0-9, and underscore (_). File names may not include special characters (e.g. &,-,*,%,/,#), periods (.), blank spaces, or accent marks, and must be unique (e.g., no other attachment may have the same file name). You may use an underscore (example: My_Attached_File.pdf) to separate a file name. The following attachments are for the Base Formula Funding and Competitive funding. a. Required Attachments (1) Abstract You must submit an up to two-page abstract summarizing the proposed project including, but not limited to, the scope of the project and proposed outcomes. Omission of the abstract will not result in your application being disqualified; the lack of the required information in the abstract, however, may impact scoring. See III.C.1 for a list of items that will result in the disqualification of your application. Should you be selected for an award, the information provided in your abstract may be published to a public facing website as a summary of your project. The abstract must include the following: 1. the lead applicant's name 2. the lead applicant entity type 3. the lead applicant city and State 4. selected funding option 5. the project title 6. the funding amount requested 7. the total number of apprentices enrolled in RAPs during the life of the grant, if applicable 8.

Public contact information Applicants must submit an abstract for the Base Formula Funding option and, if applicable, a separate abstract for the Competitive Funding option. Applicants must complete and submit the appropriate abstract(s) for their application. Please make note of the Funding option in each abstract before completing. (2) A letter from the Governor or chief elected official This letter from the Governor must be submitted as an attachment and clearly labeled as \"Governor's Letter.\" If the applicant does not submit the letter, the application will be considered incomplete and non-responsive, and it will not move forward through the merit review process. The required content of this letter is described in Section III.A. (3) Five-year State Work Plan This five-year plan must be submitted as an attachment and clearly labeled as \"Five-year State Work Plan\". If the applicant does not submit this five-year plan, the application will be considered incomplete and non-responsive, and it will not move forward through the merit review process. See Appendix A for more information on the five-year work plan for the Base Funding option. See Program Activity and Section IV.B.3.c.(1) Five-year State Work Plan for more information on the Five-year State Work Plan for the Competitive Funding option. For a suggested template, see Appendix E. (4) SF-424, SF-424A, and Budget Narrative In addition to the Base Formula Funding requirements, applicants choosing to request Competitive Funding, must include a separate SF-424, SF-424A and Budget Narrative as attachments to the application. b. Requested Attachments We request the following attachments, but their omission will not cause us to disqualify the application. The omission of the attachment will, however, impact scoring unless otherwise noted. (1) Past Performance Documentation This attachment must include both the Chart of Past Performance and the Grantor Verification Letter (if the chart is not signed by the Grantor). See Section IV.B.3.f) for which applicants are to submit this documentation and additional instructions. These documents must be uploaded as an attachment to the application package and labeled \"Past Performance.\" Page 31 of 65 (2) Letters of Commitment or MOUs Submit signed and dated Letters of Commitment or Memoranda of Understanding between the applicant and partner organizations and/or sub-grantees that propose to provide services to support the program model and lead to the identified outcomes. See Sections III.A. and IV.B.3. These letters must be uploaded as an attachment to the application package and labeled \"Letters of Commitment.\" We encourage, as appropriate, partnering with labor organizations (labor unions or joint-labor management partnerships). (3) Indirect Cost Rate Agreement If you are requesting indirect costs based on a Negotiated Indirect Cost Rate Agreement approved by your federal Cognizant Agency, then attach the most recently approved Agreement. (For more information, see Section IV.B.2. and Section IV.E.1.) This attachment does not impact scoring of the application. This document must be uploaded as an attachment to the application package and labeled \"NICRA.\" (4) Financial System Risk Assessment Information All applicants are requested to submit Funding Opportunity Announcement Financial System Risk Assessment Information. See Section V.B.2 for a sample template and additional instructions. This attachment does not impact the scoring of the application. C. SUBMISSION DATE, TIME, PROCESS AND ADDRESS Due Date for Applications: May 01, 2023 You must submit your application electronically on https://www.grants.gov no later than 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on the closing date. Applicants are encouraged to submit their application before the closing date to minimize the risk of late receipt. We will not review applications received after 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on the closing date. We will not accept applications sent by hard-copy, e-mail, telegram, or facsimile (FAX). 1. Hardcopy Submission No applications submitted in hardcopy by mail or hand delivery (including overnight delivery) will be accepted for this funding opportunity. 2. Electronic Submission through Grants.gov Applicants submitting applications must ensure successful submission no later than 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on the closing date. Grants.gov will subsequently validate the application. The process can be complicated and time-consuming. We strongly advise you to initiate the process as soon as possible and to plan for time to resolve technical problems. Note that validation does not mean that your application has been accepted as complete or has been accepted for review by the agency. Rather, grants.gov verifies only the submission of certain parts of an application. a. How to Register to Apply through Grants.gov Page 32 of 65 Read through the registration process carefully before registering. These steps may take as long as four weeks to complete, and this time should be factored into plans for timely electronic submission in order to avoid unexpected delays that could result in the rejection of an application. Applicants must follow the online instructions for registration at https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/applicants/organization-registration.html . We recommend that you prepare the information requested before beginning the registration process. Reviewing and assembling required information before beginning the registration process will alleviate last-minute searches for required information and save time. An application submitted through Grants.gov constitutes a submission as an electronically signed application. The registration and account creation with Grants.gov, with E-Biz Point of Contact (POC) approval, establishes an Agency Organizational Representative (AOR). When an application is submitted through Grants.gov, the name of the AOR who submitted the application is inserted into the signature line of the application, serving as the electronic signature. The E-Biz POC must authorize the individual who is able to make legally binding commitments on behalf of your organization as the AOR; this step is often missed and it is crucial for valid submissions. b. How to Submit an Application to DOL via Grants.gov Grants.gov applicants can apply online using Workspace. Workspace is a shared online environment where members of a grant team may simultaneously access and edit different webforms within an application. For a complete workspace overview, refer to https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/applicants/workspace-overview.html . For access to complete instructions on how to apply for opportunities, refer to https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/applicants/apply-for-grants.html . When a registered applicant submits an application with Grants.gov, an electronic time stamp is generated within the system when the application is successfully received by Grants.gov. Grants.gov will send the applicant AOR an email acknowledgement of receipt and a tracking number (GRANTXXXXXXXX) with the successful transmission of the application, serving as proof of timely submission. The applicant will receive two email messages to provide the status of the application's progress through the system. The first email will contain a tracking number and will confirm receipt of the application by Grants.gov. The second email will indicate the application has either been successfully validated or has been rejected due to errors. Grants.gov will reject applications if the applicant's registration in SAM is expired. Only applications that have been successfully submitted by the deadline and later successfully validated will be considered . It is your responsibility to ensure a timely submission. While it is not required that an application be successfully validated before the deadline for submission, it is prudent to reserve time before the deadline in case it is necessary to resubmit an application that has not been successfully validated. Therefore, enough time should be allotted for submission (24-48 hours) and, if applicable, additional time to address errors and receive validation upon resubmission (an additional two business days for each ensuing submission). It is important to note that if enough time is not Page 33 of 65 allotted and a rejection notice is received after the due date and time, DOL will not consider the application. To ensure consideration, the components of the application must be saved as .doc, .docx, .xls, .xlsx, .rtf or .pdf files. If submitted in any other format, the applicant bears the risk that compatibility or other issues will prevent DOL from considering the application. We will attempt to open the document, but will not take any additional measures in the event of problems with opening. We strongly advise applicants to use the various tools and documents, including FAQs, which are available on the \"Applicant Resources\" page at https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/applicants/applicant-faqs.html . We encourage new prospective applicants to view the online tutorial, \"Grant Applications 101: A Plain English Guide to ETA Competitive Grants,\" available through WorkforceGPS at https://grantsapplicationandmanagement.workforcegps.org/resources/2022/05/10/15/23/H ow-to-Apply-for-a-Grant . To receive updated information about critical issues, new tips for users, and other time- sensitive updates as information is available, you may subscribe to \"Grants.gov Updates\" at https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/manage-subscriptions.html . If you encounter a problem with Grants.gov and do not find an answer in any of the other resources, contact one of the following: call 1-800-518-4726 or 606-545-5035 to speak to a Customer Support Representative or email support@grants.gov . The Grants.gov Contact Center is open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week but closed on federal holidays. If you are experiencing difficulties with your submission, it is best to call the Grants.gov Support Center and get a ticket number. Late Applications We will consider only applications successfully submitted through Grants.gov no later than 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on the closing date and then successfully validated. You take a significant risk by waiting to the last day to submit through Grants.gov. D. INTERGOVERNMENTAL REVIEW This funding opportunity is not subject to Executive Order 12372, \"Intergovernmental Review of Federal Programs.\" E. FUNDING RESTRICTIONS All proposed project costs must be necessary and reasonable and in accordance with federal guidelines. Determinations of allowable costs will be made in accordance with the Cost Principles, now found in the Office of Management and Budget's Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards (Uniform Page 34 of 65 Guidance), codified at 2 CFR Part 200 and at 2 CFR Part 2900 (Uniform Guidance-DOL specific). Disallowed costs are those charges to a grant that the grantor agency or its representative determines not to be allowed in accordance with the Cost Principles or other conditions contained in the grant. Applicants, whether successful or not, will not be entitled to reimbursement of pre-award costs. Indirect Costs As specified in the Uniform Guidance Cost Principles, indirect costs are those that are incurred for common or joint objectives and cannot be readily identified with a particular final cost objective. An indirect cost rate is required when an organization operates under more than one grant or other activity, whether federally-assisted or not. You have two options to claim reimbursement of indirect costs. Option 1: You may use a NICRA or Cost Allocation Plan (CAP) supplied by the federal Cognizant Agency. If you do not have a NICRA/CAP or have a pending NICRA/CAP, and in either case choose to include estimated indirect costs in your budget, at the time of award the Grant Officer will release funds in the amount of 10 percent of Modified Total Direct Costs (see DOL's definition below) to support indirect costs. Within 90 days of award, you are required to submit an acceptable indirect cost proposal or CAP to your federal Cognizant Agency to obtain a provisional indirect cost rate. (See Section IV.B.4. for more information on NICRA submission requirements.) Option 2: Any organization that does not have a current negotiated (including provisional) rate, with the exceptions noted at 2 CFR Part 200.414(f) in the Cost Principles, may elect to charge a de minimis rate of 10 percent of modified total direct costs (see DOL's definition below), which may be used indefinitely. If chosen, this methodology once elected must be used consistently for all Federal awards until such time as the non-Federal entity chooses to negotiate for a rate, which the non-Federal entity may apply to do at any time. (See 2 CFR Part 200.414(f) for more information on use of the de minimis rate.) Modified Total Direct Cost definition: To avoid a serious inequity in the distribution of indirect cost, DOL defines MTDC as all direct salaries and wages, applicable fringe benefits, materials and supplies, services, and travel up to the first $25,000 of each subaward or subcontract (regardless of the period of performance of the subawards or subcontracts under the award). MTDC excludes equipment, capital expenditures, charges for patient care, rental costs, tuition remission, scholarships and fellowships, participant support costs and the portion of each subaward or subcontract in excess of $25,000. Intellectual Property Rights Pursuant to 2 CFR Part 2900.13, to ensure that the federal investment of DOL funds has as broad an impact as possible and to encourage innovation in the development of new learning materials, the grantee will be required to license to the public all work created with the support of the grant under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 (CC BY) license. Work that must be licensed under the CC BY includes both new content created with the grant funds and modifications made to pre-existing, grantee-owned content using grant funds. This license allows subsequent users to copy, distribute, transmit, and adapt the copyrighted work and requires such users to attribute the work in the manner specified by the grantee. Notice Page 35 of 65 of the license shall be affixed to the work. For general information on CC BY, please visit https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0 . Instructions for marking your work with CC BY can be found at https://wiki.creativecommons.org/Marking_your_work_with_a_CC_license . Questions about CC BY as it applies to this specific funding opportunity should be submitted to the ETA Grants Management Specialist specified in Section VII. Only work that is developed by the recipient in whole or in part with grant funds is required to be licensed under the CC BY license. Pre-existing copyrighted materials licensed to or purchased by the grantee from third parties, including modifications of such materials, remain subject to the intellectual property rights the grantee receives under the terms of the particular license or purchase. In addition, works created by the grantee without grant funds do not fall under the CC BY licensing requirement. The purpose of the CC BY licensing requirement is to ensure that materials developed with funds provided by these grants result in work that can be freely reused and improved by others. When purchasing or licensing consumable or reusable materials, the grantee is expected to respect all applicable federal laws and regulations, including those pertaining to the copyright and accessibility provisions of the Federal Rehabilitation Act. Separate from the CC BY license to the public, the Federal Government reserves a paid-up, nonexclusive, and irrevocable license to reproduce, publish, or otherwise use, and to authorize others to use for federal purposes (i) the copyright in all products developed under the grant, including a subaward or contract under the grant or subaward; and (ii) any rights of copyright to which the recipient, subrecipient, or a contractor purchases ownership under an award (including, but not limited to, curricula, training models, technical assistance products, and any related materials). Such uses include, but are not limited to, the right to modify and distribute such products worldwide by any means, electronically or otherwise. The grantee may not use federal funds to pay any royalty or license fee for use of a copyrighted work, or the cost of acquiring by purchase a copyright in a work, where the Department has a license or rights of free use in such work. If revenues are generated through selling products developed with grant funds, including intellectual property, DOL treats such revenues as program income. Such program income is added to the grant and must be expended for allowable grant activities. If applicable, the following standard ETA disclaimer needs to be on all products developed in whole or in part with grant funds. \"This workforce product was funded by a grant awarded by the U.S. Department of Labor's Employment and Training Administration. The product was created by the grantee and does not necessarily reflect the official position of the U.S. Department of Labor. The U.S. Department of Labor makes no guarantees, warranties, or assurances of any kind, express or implied, with respect to such information, including any information on linked sites and including, but not limited to, accuracy of the information or its completeness, timeliness, usefulness, adequacy, continued availability, or ownership. This product is copyrighted by the institution that created it.\" Credential Transparency Page 36 of 65 The Department wishes to ensure that individuals, employers, educators and training providers have access to the most complete, current and beneficial information about providers, programs credentials, and competencies supported with these public, federal funds. To this end, the Department requires that information about all credentials (including but not limited to diplomas, badges, certificates, certifications, apprenticeships, licenses, and degrees of all levels and types) and competencies (knowledge, skills and abilities) developed or delivered through the use of these public federal funds be made publicly accessible through the use of linked open data formats that support full transparency and interoperability, such as through the use of credential transparency description language specifications. ETA will provide specific guidance and technical assistance on data elements to include in the published open data, such as information about the credential provider, the credential and its associated competencies, delivery mode, geographic coverage, the industry sector(s) and occupation(s) for which the credential was developed, related assessments, related accreditations or other quality assurances where appropriate, costs, and available outcomes. Use of Grant Funds for Participant Wages Grant funds may not be used to directly pay wages for apprentices. On-the-Job Learning: For the purposes of grants awarded under this FOA, funds may be used to subsidize the training and education costs for Registered Apprentices enrolled in programs and can include reimbursing employers for some of the extraordinary costs of OJL. For grants awarded under this FOA, the negotiated reimbursement percentage may be as high as 50 percent of the participant's hourly wage. However, DOL encourages grant recipients to negotiate lower rates or variable rates (such as starting at the maximum allowable reimbursement rate and reducing the subsidy over time), where possible, to ensure that the maximum number of Registered Apprentices will be served by the project. Finally, grant recipients must develop OJL contracts as discussed below. The contract process sets the ground rules for OJL with an employer and assists in making the determination if an employer is eligible to provide an OJL opportunity. The contract must include the federally required elements of an OJL agreement; however, States, counties, or municipalities may have additional OJL contract requirements. Contracts also outline the terms and conditions that the employer and OJL provider agree to provide for an OJL experience. Contracts with an employer can be set up for a specific period of time but need not necessarily specify the individual trainees to whom they apply. This allows the employer to provide training to more than one trainee. If an employer only has one position or plans to limit the training experience to one employee, then a contract must also include the individual trainee's information. For these grants, contracts must provide that the employer is responsible for documenting skills gained by Registered Apprentices during the training period. It should also include a description of how the reimbursement level was determined. For guidance on federally required elements of an OJL, sample templates, and other resources, grant recipients may access ETA's online technical assistance related to an OJL contract on WorkforceGPS.org at the following web address: https://ion.workforcegps.org/resources/2017/12/01/11/19/On-the-Job-Training-Toolkit Grant Recipient Technical Training: Grant recipients are required to participate in all ETA training activities related to grantee orientation, financial management and reporting, performance reporting, product dissemination, and other technical assistance training as Page 37 of 65 appropriate during the grant period. These sessions may occur via conference calls, virtual events such as webinars, and in-person meetings. Use of Funds for Supportive Services for Apprentices: While applicants are encouraged to leverage supportive services through WIOA or other funding available, when funds are not otherwise available, grant recipients may use up to 20 percent of grant funds to provide supportive services (as outlined in Section IV.B.3.c.3.ii Project Design) to individuals who are participating in grant-related pre-apprenticeship and registered apprenticeship activities provided through this grant. Under this FOA, supportive services for training apprentices include services such as transportation, childcare, dependent care, housing, counseling, provision of work tools or work uniforms, and other needs-related payments that are necessary to enable an individual to participate in education and training activities funded through this grant. Grant recipients may provide supportive services in various ways, including, but not limited to, providing the supportive service itself (e.g., childcare); providing apprentices with a voucher for the service (e.g., public transportation cards or tokens); or providing a stipend directly to a pre- apprentice. Where stipends for supportive services are provided, the stipend amount must be for costs of a specific supportive service (e.g., childcare), rather than simply based on an unidentified need. For the purposes of this FOA, grant recipients may use grant funds, up to the percentage specified above, to provide supportive services only to individuals who are participating in education and training activities provided through this grant, and only when: 1) they are unable to obtain such services through other programs, and 2) such services are necessary to enable individuals to participate in education and training activities under this grant. Grant recipients may establish limits on the provision of supportive services or provide their sub- recipients with the authority to establish such limits, including a maximum amount of funding and maximum length of time for supportive services to be available to apprentices. Grant recipients must ensure that their use of grant funds on supportive services is consistent with their organization's established written policy on the provision of supportive services. Additionally, we encourage grant recipients to identify other sources of funding for supportive services, including through co-enrolling in WIOA. Use of Funds for Incentives to Employers: Applicants may use up to 20 percent of grant funds to provide one-time \"incentive\" funds to new employers, joint labor management organizations, or industry associations (or other partners included in a multiemployer partnership) to directly fund new or expand existing RAPs in targeted industries in which they are serving. Allowable uses of incentive funding to support RAP development, launch, and sustainability, include: Registration of RAPs with an SAA or the Department ; Costs related to design and start-up of RAPs; Classroom education or online training for apprentices; Extraordinary costs related to on-the-job learning (excluding wages). These extraordinary costs to the employer can be calculated based on an apprentice's wages, as well as based on a journey worker's time as mentor for an apprentice in OJL. Train-the-trainer costs or activities; Training supplies for apprentices (in consultation with the Department); and/or Page 38 of 65 Curricula development. These incentive funds must be aligned to the goals of this FOA. Applicants must have written policies and procedures in place governing the awarding of incentive funds, and the incentives provided under this FOA must comply with these organizational policies. Policies and procedures should include detailed processes for identification of recipients, distribution, and management of the incentive funds to ensure employer commitments are met. Further, grantees shall also provide, in quarterly narrative reports to the Department, all recipients of incentive funding, status of activities related to the use of incentive funding, and when feasible, itemized costs related to the use of incentive funding. F. OTHER SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS Withdrawal of Applications: You may withdraw an application by written notice to the Grant Officer at any time before an award is made. V. APPLICATION REVIEW INFORMATION A. CRITERIA We have instituted procedures for assessing the technical merit of applications to provide for an objective review of applications and to assist you in understanding the standards against which your application will be judged. The evaluation criteria are based on the information required in the application as described in Sections IV.B.2. (Project Budget) and IV.B.3. (Project Narrative). Reviewers will award points based on the evaluation criteria described below. Section IV.B.3 (Project Narrative) of this FOA has several \"section headers\" (e.g. IV.B.3.a), Statement of Need). Each of these \"section headers\" of the Project Narrative may include one or more \"criterion,\" and each \"criterion\" includes one or more \"rating factors,\" which provide detailed specifications for the content and quality of the response to that criterion. Each of the rating factors have specific point values assigned. These point values are the number of points possible for the application to earn for the rating factor. Criterion Points (maximum) 1. Statement of Need (See Section IV.B.3.a. Statement of Need) 20 total 2. Expected Outputs and Outcomes (See Section IV.B.3.b. Expected Outcomes and Outputs) 12 total 3. Project Design (See Section IV.B.3.c. Project Design) 26 total 4. Organizational, Administrative, and Fiscal Capacity 18 total Page 39 of 65 Criterion Points (maximum) (See Section IV.B.3.e. Organizational, Administrative, and Fiscal Capacity) 5. Past Performance - Programmatic Capability (See Section IV.B.3.f. Past Performance - Programmatic Capability) 12 total 6. Budget and Budget Justification (See Section IV.B.2. Project Budget) 12 total TOTAL 100 Section IV.B.3, Project Narrative, provides a detailed explanation of the information an application must include (e.g., a comprehensive work plan for the whole period of performance with feasible and realistic dates). Reviewers will rate each \"rating factor\" based on how fully and convincingly the applicant responds. For each \"rating factor\" under each \"criterion,\" panelists will determine whether the applicant thoroughly meets, partially meets, or fails to meet the \"rating factor,\" unless otherwise noted in Section IV.B.3, based on the definitions below: Standard Rating Definition Standard for Calculating Points Thoroughly Meets The application thoroughly responds to the rating factor and fully and convincingly satisfies all of the stated specifications. Full Points Partially Meets The application responds incompletely to the rating factor or the application convincingly satisfies some, but not all, of the stated specifications. Half Points Fails to Meet The application does not respond to the rating factor or the application does respond to the rating factor but does not convincingly satisfy any of the stated specifications. Zero Points In order to receive the maximum points for each rating factor, applicants must provide a response to the requirement that fully describes the proposed program design and demonstrates the quality of approach, rather than simply re-stating a commitment to perform prescribed activities. In other words, applicants must describe why their proposal is the best strategy and how they will implement it, rather than that the strategy contains elements that conform to the requirements of this FOA. Page 40 of 65 B. REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS 1. Merit Review and Selection Process A technical merit review panel will carefully evaluate applications against the selection criteria to determine the merit of applications. These criteria are based on the policy goals, priorities, and emphases set forth in this FOA. Up to 100 points may be awarded to an applicant, depending on the quality of the responses provided. The final scores (which may include the mathematical normalization of review panels) will serve as the primary basis for selection of applications for funding. The panel results are advisory in nature and not binding on the Grant Officer. The Grant Officer reserves the right to make selections based solely on the final scores or to take into consideration other relevant factors when applicable. Such factors may include the geographic distribution of funds, representation among SAA and OA States, targeted industries and occupations such as Educational Services (K-12 Teachers), Care Economy (Healthcare, Childcare, Home Care, etc.), Climate/Clean Energy, Public Sector, Technology/Cybersecurity, Transportation, Hospitality, and the Supply Chain (logistics, warehouse, transportation, and manufacturing, including but not limited to the manufacturing of semi-conductors and biomanufacturing), and other relevant factors. The Grant Officer may consider any information that comes to their attention. The government may elect to award the grant(s) with or without discussion with the applicant. Should a grant be awarded without discussion, the award will be based on the applicant's signature on the SF-424, including electronic signature via E-Authentication on https://www.grants.gov , which constitutes a binding offer by the applicant. The Merit Review and Selection Process applies only to applications for the Competitive Funding. 2. Risk Review Process Prior to making an award, ETA will review information available through various sources, including its own records and any OMB-designated repository of government-wide eligibility qualification or financial integrity information, such as Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS), and Sam.gov. Additionally, ETA will comply with the requirements of 2 CFR Part 180 codified at 2 CFR Part 2998 (Non-procurement Debarment and Suspension). This risk evaluation may incorporate results of the evaluation of the applicant's eligibility (application screening) or the quality of its application (merit review). If ETA determines that an award will be made, special conditions that correspond to the degree of risk assessed may be applied to the award. Criteria to be evaluated include the following: i. Financial stability; ii. Quality of management systems and ability to meet the management standards prescribed in the Uniform Grant Guidance; iii. History of performance. The applicant's record in managing awards, cooperative agreements, or procurement awards, if it is a prior recipient of such federal awards, including timeliness of compliance with applicable reporting requirements and, if applicable, the extent to which any previously awarded amounts will be expended prior to future awards; Page 41 of 65 iv. Reports and findings from audits performed under Subpart F-Audit Requirements of the Uniform Grant Guidance or the reports and findings of any other available audits and monitoring reports containing findings, issues of non-compliance, or questioned costs; v. The applicant's ability to effectively implement statutory, regulatory, and other requirements imposed on recipients. NOTE: As part of ETA's Risk Review process, the Grant Officer will determine the following: If the applicant had any restriction on spending for any ETA grant due to adverse monitoring findings; or If the applicant received a High Risk determination in accordance with TEGL 23-15 . Depending on the severity of the findings and whether the findings were resolved, the Grant Officer may, at their discretion, elect not to fund the applicant for a grant award regardless of the applicant's score in the competition. All applicants are requested to submit the following information as an attachment to their application (suggested template below) for ETA to assess the applicant's Financial System. This information will be taken into account as one component of ETA's Risk Review Process. Applicants may use the suggested template or answer the questions in a separate attachment. It is unlikely that an organization will be able to manage a federal grant without the following system/processes in place. Applicants are expected to have these in place before applying for a grant with ETA.

Guidance from DOL is found at https://www.dol.gov/agencies/oasam/grants/religious-freedom-restoration-act/guidance . b. Lobbying or Fundraising the U.S. Government with Federal Funds Page 46 of 65 In accordance with Section 18 of the Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995 (Public Law 104-65) (2 U.S.C. \u00a7 1611), non-profit entities incorporated under Internal Revenue Service Code section 501(c)(4) that engage in lobbying activities are not eligible to receive federal funds and grants. No activity, including awareness-raising and advocacy activities, may include fundraising for, or lobbying of, U.S. federal, state, or local governments (see 2 CFR Part 200.450 for more information). c. Transparency Act Requirements You must ensure that you have the necessary processes and systems in place to comply with the reporting requirements of the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (Pub. Law 109-282, as amended by the Government Funding Transparency Act of 2008, Pub. Law 110-252, Title VI, Chap. 2, Sec. 6202), as follows. Except for those excepted from the Transparency Act under sub-paragraphs 1, 2, and 3 below, you must ensure that you have the necessary processes and systems in place to comply with the subaward and executive total compensation reporting requirements of the Transparency Act, should you receive funding. Upon award, you will receive detailed information on the reporting requirements of the Transparency Act, as described in 2 CFR Part 170, Appendix A, which can be found at https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CFR-2021-title2-vol1/pdf/CFR-2021- title2-vol1-part170-appA.pdf . The following types of awards are not subject to the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act. 1. Federal awards to individuals who apply for or receive federal awards as natural persons (e.g., unrelated to any business or non-profit organization he or she may own or operate in his or her name); 2. Federal awards to entities that had a gross income, from all sources, of less than $300,000 in the entities' previous tax year; and 3. Federal awards, if the required reporting would disclose classified information. d. Safeguarding Data Including Personally Identifiable Information (PII) Applicants submitting applications in response to this FOA must recognize that confidentiality of PII and other sensitive data is of paramount importance to the Department of Labor and must be observed except where disclosure is allowed by the prior written approval of the Grant Officer or by court order. By submitting an application, you are assuring that all data exchanges conducted through or during the course of performance of this grant will be conducted in a manner consistent with applicable federal law and TEGL 39-11 (issued June 28, 2012). All such activity conducted by ETA and/or recipient(s) will be performed in a manner consistent with applicable state and federal laws. By submitting a grant application, you agree to take all necessary steps to protect such confidentiality by complying with the following provisions that are applicable in governing the handling of confidential information: You must ensure that PII and sensitive data developed, obtained, or otherwise associated with DOL/ETA funded grants is securely transmitted. Page 47 of 65 i. To ensure that such PII is not transmitted to unauthorized users, all PII and other sensitive data transmitted via e-mail or stored on CDs, DVDs, thumb drives, etc., must be encrypted using a Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) 140-2 compliant and National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) validated cryptographic module. You must not e-mail unencrypted sensitive PII to any entity, including ETA or contractors. ii. You must take the steps necessary to ensure the privacy of all PII obtained from participants and/or other individuals and to protect such information from unauthorized disclosure. You must maintain such PII in accordance with the ETA standards for information security described in TEGL NO. 39-11 and any updates to such standards we provide to you. Grantees who wish to obtain more information on data security should contact their Federal Project Officer. iii. You must ensure that any PII used during the performance of your grant has been obtained in conformity with applicable federal and state laws governing the confidentiality of information. iv. You further acknowledge that all PII data obtained through your ETA grant must be stored in an area that is physically safe from access by unauthorized persons at all times and the data will be processed using recipient-issued equipment, managed information technology (IT) services, and designated locations approved by ETA. Accessing, processing, and storing of ETA grant PII data on personally owned equipment, at off-site locations, (e.g., employee's home), and non-recipient managed IT services, (e.g., Yahoo mail), is strictly prohibited unless approved by ETA. v. Your employees and other personnel who will have access to sensitive/confidential/proprietary/private data must be advised of the confidential nature of the information, the safeguards required to protect the information, and that there are civil and criminal sanctions for noncompliance with such safeguards that are contained in federal and state laws. vi. You must have policies and procedures in place under which your employees and other personnel, before being granted access to PII, acknowledge their understanding of the confidential nature of the data and the safeguards with which they must comply in their handling of such data, as well as the fact that they may be liable to civil and criminal sanctions for improper disclosure. vii. You must not extract information from data supplied by ETA for any purpose not stated in the grant agreement. viii. Access to any PII created by the ETA grant must be restricted to only those employees of the grant recipient who need it in their official capacity to perform duties in connection with the scope of work in the grant agreement. ix. All PII data must be processed in a manner that will protect the confidentiality of the records/documents and is designed to prevent unauthorized persons from retrieving such records by computer, remote terminal, or any other means. Data may be downloaded to, or maintained on, mobile or portable devices only if the data are encrypted using NIST validated software products based on FIPS 140-2 encryption. In addition, wage data may be accessed only from secure locations. x. PII data obtained by the recipient through a request from ETA must not be disclosed to anyone but the individual requestor, except as permitted by the Grant Officer or by court order. Page 48 of 65 xi. You must permit ETA to make onsite inspections during regular business hours for the purpose of conducting audits and/or conducting other investigations to assure that you are complying with the confidentiality requirements described above. In accordance with this responsibility, you must make records applicable to this Agreement available to authorized persons for the purpose of inspection, review, and/or audit. xii. You must retain data received from ETA only for the period of time required to use it for assessment and other purposes, or to satisfy applicable federal records retention requirements, if any. Thereafter, you agree that all data will be destroyed, including the degaussing of magnetic tape files and deletion of electronic data. e. Record Retention You must follow federal guidelines on record retention, which require that you maintain all records pertaining to grant activities for a period of at least three years from the date of submission of the final expenditure report. See 2 CFR Part 200.333-.337 for more specific information, including information about the start of the record retention period for awards that are renewed quarterly or annually, and when the records must be retained for more than three years. f. Use of Contracts and Subawards You must abide by the following definitions of contract, contractor, subaward, and subrecipient. Contract: Contract means a legal instrument by which a non-federal entity (defined as a state or local government, Indian tribe, institution of higher education (IHE), non-profit organization, for-profit entity, foreign public entity, or a foreign organization that carries out a federal award as a recipient or subrecipient) purchases property or services needed to carry out the project or program under a federal award. The term as used in this FOA does not include a legal instrument, even if the non-federal entity considers it a contract, when the substance of the transaction meets the definition of a federal award or subaward (see definition of Subaward below). Contractor: Contractor means an entity that receives a contract as defined above in Contract. Subaward: Subaward means an award provided by a pass-through entity (defined as a non- federal entity that provides a subaward to a subrecipient to carry out part of a federal program) to a subrecipient for the subrecipient to carry out part of a federal award received by the pass-through entity. It does not include payments to a contractor or payments to an individual that is a beneficiary of a federal program. A subaward may be provided through any form of legal agreement, including an agreement that the pass-through entity considers a contract. Subrecipient: Subrecipient means a non-federal entity that receives a subaward from a pass-through entity to carry out part of a federal program, but does not include an individual that is a beneficiary of such program. A subrecipient may also be a recipient of other federal awards directly from a federal awarding agency. Page 49 of 65 You must follow the provisions at 2 CFR 200.330-.332 regarding subrecipient monitoring and management. Also see 2 CFR Part 200.308(c)(6) regarding prior approval requirements for subawards. When awarding subawards, you are required to comply with provisions on government-wide suspension and debarment found at 2 CFR Part 180 and codified at 2 Part CFR Part 2998. g. Closeout of Grant Award Any entity that receives an award under this Announcement must close its grant with ETA at the end of the final year of the grant. Information about this process may be found in ETA's Grant Closeout FAQ located at https://www.dol.gov/sites/dolgov/files/ETA/grants/pdfs/GCFAQ.pdf . 3. Other Administrative Standards and Provisions Except as specifically provided in this FOA, our acceptance of an application and an award of federal funds to sponsor any programs(s) does not provide a waiver of any grant requirements and/or procedures. For example, the OMB Uniform Guidance requires that an entity's procurement procedures ensure that all procurement transactions are conducted, as much as practical, to provide full and open competition. If an application identifies a specific entity to provide goods or services, the award does not provide the justification or basis to sole-source the procurement (i.e., avoid competition). 4. Special Program Requirements a. ETA Evaluation As a condition of grant award, grantees are required to participate in an evaluation, if undertaken by DOL. The evaluation may include an implementation assessment across grantees, an impact and/or outcomes analysis of all or selected sites within or across grantees, and a benefit/cost analysis or assessment of return on investment. Conducting an impact analysis could involve random assignment (which involves random assignment of eligible participants into a treatment group that would receive program services or enhanced program services, or into control group(s) that would receive no program services or program services that are not enhanced). We may require applicants to collect data elements to aid the evaluation. As a part of the evaluation, as a condition of award, grantees must agree to: (1) make records available to the evaluation contractor on participants, employers, and funding; (2) provide access to program operating personnel, participants, and operational and financial records, and any other relevant documents to calculate program costs and benefits; and (3) in the case of an impact analysis, facilitate the assignment by lottery of participants to program services, including the possible increased recruitment of potential participants; and (4) follow evaluation procedures as specified by the evaluation contractor under the direction of DOL. b. Performance Goals Please note that applicants will be held to outcomes provided, and failure to meet those outcomes may result in technical assistance or other intervention by ETA, and may also have a significant impact on decisions about future grants with ETA. Page 50 of 65 C. REPORTING You must meet DOL reporting requirements. Specifically, you must submit the reports and documents listed below to DOL electronically. 1. Quarterly Financial Reports A Quarterly Financial Status Report (ETA 9130) is required until such time as all funds have been expended or the grant period has expired. Quarterly reports are due by the 15th day of the second month after each calendar-year quarter. On the final Financial Status Report, you must include any subaward amounts so we can calculate final indirect costs, if applicable. You must use DOL's Online Electronic Reporting System and information and instructions will be provided to grantees. For other guidance on ETA's financial reporting, reference TEGL 20-19 and our webpage at https://www.dol.gov/agencies/eta/grants/management/reporting . 2. Quarterly Performance Reports The grantee must submit a quarterly performance report by the 15th day of the second month after each calendar-year quarter. The report must include quarterly information on interim indicators and performance goals. The last quarterly progress report will serve as the grant's Final Performance Report. This report must provide both quarterly and cumulative information on the grant performance. Submission requirements will be provided to grantees upon award. We will also provide you with guidance about the data and other information that is required to be collected and reported on either a regular basis or special request basis. Grantees are required to submit a Quarterly Progress Report containing updates on the implementation and progress specified in the grant's Statement of Work and the status of grant program outcomes for all participants that receive grant-funded services. As described above, these grants will align with WIOA performance reporting requirements. DOL will provide grantees with access to the online reporting system, WIPS, along with formal guidance and technical assistance for data collection and reporting. The grantee must submit a quarterly performance report within 45 days after the end of each calendar-year quarter. This report includes a quarterly performance report (QPR), which is a quantitative report of all participants served through the grant program. The QPR is a quarterly aggregate of the individual participant records that the grantee has collected and uploaded as a data file into the WIPS. In order to submit these quarterly reports, the grantee will be expected to track and report on certain participant-level data to ETA, including Social Security Numbers (SSNs), on all individuals who are provided grant-funded services. The SSN information allows ETA to efficiently match employment data from State unemployment insurance and other wage records. Thus, the collection of participant SSNs lessens the burden on grantees in tracking exit- based employment measures (WIOA Primary Indicators of Performance), while permitting consistent and reliable outcome information to be produced regarding the program. Applicants may view the current OMB approved reporting requirements that will apply to these grants, OMB Control No. 1205-0521. 3. Quarterly Narrative Performance Reports In addition to the Quarterly Performance Report, the grantee must submit the Joint Quarterly Narrative Performance Report Template (ETA 9179) progress report by the 15th day of the Page 51 of 65 second month after each calendar year quarter during which the grant is within the period of performance for the award. The report includes quarterly information regarding accomplishments, including project success stories, upcoming grant activities, and promising approaches and processes, as well as progress toward performance outcomes, including updates on product, curricula, and training development.

SKILLSCOMMONS RESOURCES SkillsCommons (https://www.skillscommons.org ) offers an online library of curriculum and related training resources to obtain industry-recognized credentials in manufacturing, IT, healthcare, energy, and other industries. The website contains thousands of Open Educational Resources (OER) for job-driven workforce development, which were produced by grantees funded through DOL's Trade Adjustment Assistance Community College and Career Training (TAACCCT) program. Community colleges and other training providers across the nation can reuse, revise, redistribute, and reorganize the OER on SkillsCommons for institutional, industry, and individual use. E. REGISTERED APPRENTICESHIP EVIDENCE-BASED RESEARCH ETA launched the American Apprenticeship Initiative (AAI) in October 2015 and provided five- year grants to 46 grantees across the country to expand registered apprenticeship into new sectors, such as healthcare and information technology (IT), and to populations historically underrepresented in apprenticeships, such as women, racial and ethnic minorities, and veterans. Some AAI grantees received no-cost extensions of their periods of performance through September 2021. In April 2016, ETA, in collaboration with DOL's Chief Evaluation Office (CEO), commissioned an evaluation of the AAI grant program to build evidence about the effectiveness of registered apprenticeship for apprentices and employers. The evaluation included four sub-studies (an implementation study to document AAI grantee activities; an outcomes study to document in- program and post-program outcomes for AAI apprentices and pre-apprentices; an employer return-on-investment (ROI) study to document the costs to employers and benefits of registered apprenticeship programs; and a pilot test of a strategy to encourage employers to adopt registered apprenticeship to assess the implementation and outcomes of a consultative sales approach to employer recruitment by two AAI grantees). Separate from the evaluation, Page 53 of 65 there is a TA Report which discusses lessons learned from the Initiative. Three reports comprised the implementation sub-study and the AAI Evaluation included five topical issue briefs. Across the AAI sub-studies and briefs, analyses of key data sources included reviews of grantee applications and documents; site visits with grantees, employers and other grantee partners; surveys with grantees, employers, and apprentice participants; apprenticeship data reported to DOL; quarterly wage records; and publicly available data. Applicants may use the AAI evaluation as a resource to inform their program design, model their projects after the successes, and consider the lessons learned from past grantees when conceptualizing their projects. https://www.apprenticeship.gov/evaluation-american-apprenticeship-initiative-aai F.

Signed 03/17/2023 in Washington, D.C. by: Brinda Ruggles Grant Officer, Employment and Training Administration APPENDIX A BASE FORMULA FUNDING In addition to the required documents listed under III.C.1 Application Screening Criteria, all applicants must provide in their project narrative in response to Appendix A, with no minimum page limit and which does not count again the 20-page limit specified in Section IV.B.3 Project Narrative: 1) a description of the activities you intend to implement, 2) a description of your efforts in the community(ies) you intend to reach, 3) your success benchmarks and measures, 4) a description of the specific population(s) you intend to impact, and 5) the names of the organizations with whom you will form partnerships. Your project narrative should detail your plan to expand Registered Apprenticeship and/or pre-apprenticeships leading to RAPs in your State. If applying for only the Base Formula Funding option, please ensure that you indicate so in the Abstract and your Project Narrative clearly addresses guidelines above and covers all the required activities, at minimum, mentioned below. The Department reserves the right to change this amount depending on the quantity and quality of applications submitted. The base formula funding has a Period of Performance (POP) of one year. Subject to available funds, the Department is committed to awarding annual Base Formula Funding (based on a formula and dependent on availability). Continuation of funding to grantees is subject to the discretion of DOL and contingent upon the availability of funds, satisfactory progress of the grantee's project, and adequate stewardship of federal funds. Specifically, States will be considered for funding in future years based on how they utilize funding based on previous year(s) of SAEF Base Formula Funding and the level of implementation of their proposed Page 55 of 65 project activities. Each year, DOL will look at applicants' level of expenditure of this grant's funds and level of implementation of their proposed project activities to award additional Base Formula Funding in subsequent years. All grantees must do the following, at a minimum, as allowable activities under this Base Formula Funding: 1. Develop and implement a five-year State Registered Apprenticeship work plan that includes key expansion efforts and how funds will be spent down. A five-year plan is a required activity for all applicants. For this first round of funding, applicants may submit a preliminary version, and within 120 days of grant award, grantees must submit their final, detailed plan. The plan must be very detailed for the applicant's first year of activity, charting out quarterly milestones, and subsequent years may be less detailed, providing bi-annual milestones. This plan will be used to measure States' progress, which will affect future funding decisions. If the applicant applies for subsequent rounds of funding, they must expand on the details of their plan based on the previous year(s) of activity. This plan will be used to measure their progress for future funding. The intent of the five-year plan is to have States strategically think about how they will use subsequent years' funding to build on and improve their current activities, accomplishments, challenges, and goals. Applicants will assess and revise, as necessary, their five-year plan in future rounds of funding for this grant. A suggested template of the five-year plan can be found in Appendix E. o The plan should show how annual funds would build on the previous years' modernization, expansion, and equity efforts. States must take into consideration how they are growing the number of registered apprentices and registered apprenticeship programs in their State, how they are reaching underrepresented populations and underserved communities, how they can improve/streamline their internal Statewide registered apprenticeship processes, how they can better utilize demographic and occupational data for informed decision-making, and how the State can leverage technology and resources. Based on that plan and in addition to the required activities, States should select activities from the \"Encouraged Activities\" list that will further their mission. o As part of the five-year plan, States must provide a plan that sufficiently shows their plan to spend down their Apprenticeship grants concurrently. States must provide a list of their current OA grants, the amount(s) awarded, amount(s) unspent, and how remaining amounts will be expended while also expending the Base Formula Funding of this grant. 2. Build Statewide capacity to increase the number and quality of RAPs through stronger alignment with the education and workforce systems. 3. For SAAs, implement data sharing, system change, and governance requirements to comply with 29 CFR Parts 29 and 30 and ensure a strong and modernized Registered Apprenticeship system by promoting the standardization of RAPs and committing to building a unified National Apprenticeship system. This includes sharing of data and ensuring that quality programs are registered within the State and align with the five key areas of RAPs: OJL, RI, progressive wages, mentoring, and industry-recognized credential attainment to ensure reciprocity across the National Apprenticeship system. Page 56 of 65 4. For SAAs, utilize funds to adopt and fully integrate RAPIDS. Encouraged activities include: 1. Increase apprenticeship staff to support the State's required activities and proposed encouraged activities, if applicable. This includes training for grantee staff, as well as other State and local workforce board staff, related to the Registered Apprenticeship system. 2. Build stronger partnerships with the State and local workforce and education system. Additionally, consider ways to align and support the jobs required to implement the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), CHIPS and Science Act (CHIPS Act), and the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). This can include working with employers to increase their awareness of Registered Apprenticeship opportunities in the state and identify opportunities for them to join existing RAPs and/or start new RAPs. 3. Utilize funding to support drafting of policies, procedures, and/or State regulations to strengthen the Registered Apprenticeship system. 4. Improve data collection, data sharing, and data integrity; and if applicable, purchase software upgrades that directly support these improvements. 5. For SAAs, work to build reciprocity between SAAs to better ensure journey-worker credentials earned through RAPs are portable nationwide following the regulation at 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 29.13(7) that stipulates SAAs are to \"accord reciprocal approval for Federal purposes to apprentices, apprenticeship programs and standards that are registered in other States by the Office of Apprenticeship or a Registration Agency if such reciprocity is requested by the apprenticeship program sponsor.\" 6. Create or improve outreach materials and communication strategies for engaging employers, parents, educators, underrepresented populations, other critical stakeholders, and State residents; explaining the benefits of registered apprenticeship; and generating further support across the State. 7. Training for grant staff related to Registered Apprenticeship. 8. Establish or expand the role of the business service representative or apprenticeship navigator with the promotion of registered apprenticeship. 9. Build Statewide capacity by hiring additional staff, including FTEs, and contractors and consultants, if necessary. 10. Improve employer engagement to increase RAP adoption for in-demand industries and occupations within the State. 11. Improve and/or develop marketing and advertising materials for RAPs (i.e., produce RAP public service announcements that are targeted to the Care Economy (Healthcare, Childcare, Home Care, etc.), Climate/Clean Energy, Public Sector, Educational Services (Teachers), Technology/Cybersecurity, Transportation, Hospitality, and the Supply Chain (logistics, warehouse, transportation, and manufacturing, including but not limited to the manufacturing of semi-conductors and biomanufacturing), invest in targeted social media, or contribute printed materials to accelerator events in the State). 12. Travel within the State for meetings, such as conferences, industry sector meetings, convenings, accelerator groups, and Local Workforce Investments Boards (WIBs) directly related to expanding Registered Apprenticeship. For travel outside of the State, which includes meetings held by the National Office of Apprenticeship, prior approval from the grantee's FPO is required. Page 57 of 65 13. Collaborate with other local, State, or federal agencies in education and workforce outside of the State's apprenticeship office, including to expand RAP in the public sector. 14. Create or expand the State's apprenticeship website that list requirements in order to improve reciprocity to include prevailing wage, licensing, program registration, and fee requirements, etc. 15. Purchase Salesforce license. Salesforce allows users to access more easily DOL-funded and OA activities, including employer outreach, to foster coordination across the state's Registered Apprenticeship system. If applicants choose to not purchase Salesforce licenses, they must provide in their plans mechanisms for sharing information to OA regarding employer outreach. 16. Create course curriculum that can be used by education providers to provide college or transferable education credits to registered apprentices. 17. Serve targeted communities and/or align with the Administration's policy priorities (e.g., Ability to develop multilingual resources, serve Energy Communities, have an expertise in developing workforce training in high-growth sectors, organizations that would use the funds to provide Heat Hazard training or the Department's Know Your Rights information). APPENDIX B BASE FORMULA FUNDING AMOUNTS ETA will award States as much as $40,000,000 reflecting the formula described below. States may apply for an amount up to the Base Funding amount determined by the formula described below. The funding is allocated by the following formula: 1. 1/3 as a minimum allotment to all 54 eligible States 2. 2/3 allocated as follows: o Fifty percent is based on each State's relative share of Total Registered Apprentices (FY 2022 Apprentice Data ending 9/30/22); o Fifty percent is based on: 1. 33 percent of each State's relative share of total job openings within Bureau of Labor Statistics designated Region (most recent seasonally adjusted report for 2022, that is September 30, 2022); 2. 33 percent of each State's relative share of total unemployed (LAUS totals, July 2021 -June 2022); 3. 33 percent of each State's relative Civilian Share of Total Workforce (LAUS totals, July 2021 -June 2022). Eligible entities are States, as defined at 29 CFR Section 29.2. The term \"State\" means \"any of the 50 States of the United States, District of Columbia, or any Territory or possession of the United States.\" For the purposes of this FOA, the eligible 54 U.S. States and territories include all 50 States of the United States, District of Columbia, and territories whose Active Apprentices exceeds 100 apprentices, i.e., Guam, Puerto Rico, and American Samoa.
