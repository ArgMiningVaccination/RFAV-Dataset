More recently, TCM has become popular as an [alternative medicine](/wiki/Alternative_medicine) in [Europe](/wiki/Europe) and [North America](/wiki/North_America). Like much such as [feng shui](/wiki/Feng_shui) and the [martial arts](/wiki/Martial_arts), Chinese medicine is based on the [qi](/wiki/Qi) (or chi, ) principle of [energy](/wiki/Subtle_energy). Qi is said to be channelled through a complex system of [meridians](/wiki/Meridians) in the body, and illnesses are believed to be related to blocked or unbalanced flow of qi.

[[5]](#cite_note-wong-5):6-7 In addition, he was said to have discovered, or invented, [tea](/wiki/Tea), the hoe, the plow, the axe, wells, irrigation, preserving seeds in boiled horse urine, the 24 hours of the day, the calendar, the weekly farmers' market, the harvest festival, pulse measuring, [moxibustion](/wiki/Moxibustion) and acupuncture. [[6]](#cite_note-6):190-199 Additionally, he was said to have known the secret to [immortality](/wiki/Immortality) and the [transmutation of substances into gold](/wiki/Alchemy). Religion was deeply intertwined with Chinese medicine, particularly in the earliest years, and it included sorcery, divination (I Ching), [astrology](/wiki/Astrology) [[5]](#cite_note-wong-5):12-14 In ancient times, doctors were referred to as priest-doctors (Wu I). [[5]](#cite_note-wong-5):13 [Spirituality](/wiki/Spirituality) remains an important part of Chinese medicine [[7]](#cite_note-7) The Chinese have a reverence for [authority](/wiki/Argument_from_authority), [[5]](#cite_note-wong-5):86 in large part due to the \"Five Relationships\" of [Confucianism](/wiki/Confucianism). This likely is a source of resistance to change and acceptance of [evidence-based medicine](/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine). Pre-modern history[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Traditional_Chinese_medicine&action=edit\u00a7ion=3)] Chinese mutually-contradictory classics: [[8]](#cite_note-taylor-8):142 [Huangdi Neijing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huangdi_Neijing)() or Inner Canon of the Yellow Emperor or Inner Canon (c. 100 CE) [Shanghan Lun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghan_Lun)() or Treatise on Cold Damage Diseases or Book of Cold Damage (c. 200 CE) [Jingui Yaol\u00fce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jingui_Yaol%C3%BCe)() or Essential Prescriptions from the Golden Cabinet or Golden Casket [[note 1]](#cite_note-9)(c. 200 CE) - Various texts [edit](/w/index.php?title=Traditional_Chinese_medicine&action=edit\u00a7ion=4)] what has worked in the 'fields' of herbalism has been added to pharmacology and what hasn't worked has been discarded, prior to the [scientific method](/wiki/Scientific_method), there really wasn't a good way to gather reliable information. Various medicine men and priests and the like would have made an observation and passed it on to other healers, but not have the resources or education to actually test these observations. Some of the herbs and such would work (for example, willow bark tea), others did not. But without the resources of a modern university research department, better forms of acquiring knowledge weren't really practical. Various herbal and [folk remedies](/wiki/Folk_remedy) that relied on limited observation and lacked rigorous testing were [protosciences](/wiki/Protoscience) rather than pseudo-sciences. That is, \"not yet sciences\", rather than \"never sciences\". There were indeed some important discoveries made by Chinese medicine. The most important of which was \"variolation\" (vaccination); exposing someone to a weak form of [smallpox](/wiki/Smallpox) (or cowpox) to prevent that person succumbing later on to a deadlier form of smallpox. This folk remedy happened to work, and spread to [India](/wiki/India), then to the [Ottoman Empire](/wiki/Ottoman_Empire) and then to Europe. This makes [vaccine denialists](/wiki/Vaccine_denial) that adhere to other forms of TCM a rather strange breed. Modern times[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Traditional_Chinese_medicine&action=edit\u00a7ion=5)] In China[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Traditional_Chinese_medicine&action=edit\u00a7ion=6)] Access to Western medicine in China was especially difficult in China up through the first half of the 20th century due to [poverty](/wiki/Poverty) and wars (particularly the [Second Sino-Japanese War](/wiki/World_War_II#Second_Sino-Japanese_War) and the [civil war](/wiki/Civil_war)). During the [Chinese Civil War](/wiki/Chinese_Civil_War), the People's Liberation Army used Chinese medicine by necessity for lack of reliable access to anything else. Following the victory of the People's Liberation Army, [Mao Zedong](/wiki/Mao_Zedong) saw the importance of maintaining the employment of the hundreds of thousands of people involved in various aspects of Chinese medicine, so as to assure social stability. [[8]](#cite_note-taylor-8):35,43 Mao laid out abstract goals (or slogans) for the integration of Chinese and Western medicine, the details of which were left to Chinese Communist Party officials: [[8]](#cite_note-taylor-8):11-13 - 1945-50: The Co-operation of Chinese and Western Medicines - 1950-58: The Unification of Chinese and Western Medicines - 1950-53: Chinese Medicine Studies Western Medicine - 1954-58: Western Medicine Studies Chinese Medicine - 1958-: The Integration of Chinese and Western Medicine Evidence suggests that as early as 1954, Mao had doubts about the effectiveness of Chinese medicine. [[8]](#cite_note-taylor-8):43 Both Mao and Li Zhisui, Mao's personal physician, were very [skeptical](/wiki/Skeptical) of the usefulness of Chinese medicine. [[10]](#cite_note-li-11):84,548,551 Mao was also ignorant of modern medicine. [[10]](#cite_note-li-11):99 [[note 2]](#cite_note-12) [[note 3]](#cite_note-15) Because Mao was privately skeptical of Chinese medicine and ignorant of modern medicine, his promotion of integrative medicine was entirely a political maneuver. Because Mao was skeptical of Chinese medicine, his strong and continuous promotion of Chinese medicine was intentionally promoting [nationalism](/wiki/Nationalism) while sacrificing the physical health of the nation. The nationalist aspect Chinese medicine was made explicit by: - Mao's use of the slogan, \"China's medicine and pharmacology is a great Cheng](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/He_Cheng), a Western medicine trained physician in the revolutionary army who eventually became director of the People's Government Ministry of Health, [[8]](#cite_note-taylor-8):32 endorsed the idea of nationalist-based sciences. He Cheng was particularly interested in [Soviet](/wiki/Soviet) [science](/wiki/Science). [[8]](#cite_note-taylor-8):53 The problem with relying on nationalist science is that there is no such thing. Science is based on a universal, the [scientific method](/wiki/Scientific_method). Soviet science, while excellent in some regards, was deficient in others due to reliance on [ideology](/wiki/Ideology) and [dialectical materialism](/wiki/Dialectical_materialism). [[13]](#cite_note-16) It was during this period (roughly mid-1950s to mid-1960s) that Chinese medicine became standardized, resolving or glossing over the contradictory elements of the four ancient texts. [[8]](#cite_note-taylor-8):79,127,142 In 1955, the term 'Traditional Chinese Medicine' (in capital letters) [[note 4]](#cite_note-17) began to be used to refer to this standardized version to the English-speaking world; notably, it was first used as a political term. [[8]](#cite_note-taylor-8):79,84-86 The term in Chinese however remained the same as it was in pre-revolutionary China, (zhongyi) as it always had, which just translates to 'Chinese medicine', a term that was used starting in the 19th century to contrast it with Western medicine (, xiyi). [[8]](#cite_note-taylor-8):79 It was also during this period that the idea of [integrated medicine](/wiki/Integrative_medicine) developed, based on Mao's sloganeering, the mixing Chinese and Western medicine. [[8]](#cite_note-taylor-8):11-13,68,135-136 Other non-standardized forms of Chinese medicine are still practiced both within the People's Republic of China (PRC) and in [Singapore](/wiki/Singapore), Hong Kong and Taiwan. [[8]](#cite_note-taylor-8):86-87 Despite the death of Mao, the rise of [capitalism](/wiki/Capitalism), the general lack of evidence supporting TCM, and the preference of Chinese citizens for TCM only for minor ailments, [[8]](#cite_note-taylor-8):152-153 the Chinese government continues to actively promote TCM within China and abroad, [[14]](#cite_note-18) [[15]](#cite_note-19) likely based on a sense of nationalism. In the West[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Traditional_Chinese_medicine&action=edit\u00a7ion=7)] TCM became more widely noticed in the West beginning in the 1970s. [[8]](#cite_note-taylor-8):137-138 [[16]](#cite_note-20) The biggest [publicity generator](/wiki/Public_relations) for China at this time was acupuncture analgesia for surgery, which was publicized by James Reston, a [New York Times](/wiki/New_York_Times) reporter who accompanied Secretary of State [Henry Kissinger](/wiki/Henry_Kissinger) to China in 1971, in preparation for President [Richard Nixon](/wiki/Richard_Nixon)'s visit in 1972. Reston had an emergency appendectomy while in China using conventioanal anesthesia, [[8]](#cite_note-taylor-8):138 and received post-surgical acupuncture analgesia, which he described as causing diversionary pain. [[17]](#cite_note-21) Acupuncture analgesia has been portrayed elsewhere as occurring during surgery, [[8]](#cite_note-taylor-8):138-140 but this has largely been debunked: when acupuncture has been used during surgery, it has been used in addition to chemical sedatives. [[18]](#cite_note-22) [[19]](#cite_note-novella-23) [[20]](#cite_note-24) [[21]](#cite_note-25) Notably, the first three TCM following Reston's article [[22]](#cite_note-26) [[23]](#cite_note-27) [[24]](#cite_note-28) were based on a 1958 textbook, The Outline of TCM (, Zhongyixue Gailun) [[25]](#cite_note-29) that was filtered through revolutionary communist fervor. [[8]](#cite_note-taylor-8):144-147 [[19]](#cite_note-novella-23) TCM has become popular in North America and Europe during recent decades, largely due to the growing popularity of [CAM](/wiki/CAM) (Complementary and Alternative Medicine) and the [New Age](/wiki/New_Age) preoccupation with other Eastern [woo](/wiki/Woo) such as feng shui, [Chinese astrology](/wiki/Chinese_astrology), [Reiki](/wiki/Reiki) and [Zen Buddhism](/wiki/Zen). As with most of these fads, the most common variants of TCM popularised in the west tend to be simplified and bastardised versions of authentic TCM, and are often bundled with other forms of CAM. For example, Chinese medicine centers in the [UK](/wiki/UK) and [USA](/wiki/USA) often offer non-Chinese complementary therapies such as [hypnotherapy](/wiki/Hypnotherapy) and [homeopathy](/wiki/Homeopathy), alongside Chinese herbalism and acupuncture. However, just because one remedy works does not mean all the others work. Each remedy or herb gets tested; those that work become part of medicine, while those that don't get discarded. Keeping the remedies that are unproven or have been proven not to work is instead pseudoscience. Materia medica[ in the 1578 by [Li Shizhen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Li_Shizhen) (). An early book was written in 1505 by the physician Liu Wentai under orders from Emperor Xiaozong, titled Bencao Pinhui Jingyao (Collection of the Essential Medical Herbs of Materia Medica), but this book was not available to the general public and is not now well-known. [[26]](#cite_note-30) [[27]](#cite_note-31) The Bencao Gangmu has remained in use continuously since its publication, and was replaced in China by the 10-volume Zhong Hua Ben Cao (, Encyclopedia of Chinese Materia in 1999. [[28]](#cite_note-32) The now-official Pharmacopoeia of the People's Republic of China was published in 2005. [[29]](#cite_note-33) Controversial and dangerous ingredients used in TCM[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Traditional_Chinese_medicine&action=edit\u00a7ion=9)] TCM ingredients can range from common plants, such as dandelion, persimmon, and mint, to weird or even dangerous stuff. Some things found in TCM include genitals of various animals (including [dogs](/wiki/Dog), tigers, seals, oxen, [goats](/wiki/Goat), and deer), bear bile (commonly obtained by means of slow, inhumane extraction methods), and [(genuine)](/wiki/Irony) [snake oil](/wiki/Snake_oil). [[3]](#cite_note-read-3) [[30]](#cite_note-34) [[31]](#cite_note-35) It is worth noting that the sale and use of all of these animal ingredients is illegal in many parts of [Asia](/wiki/Asia), [Europe](/wiki/Europe), [North America](/wiki/North_America) and almost everywhere else. New methods of combating the use of these illegal animal parts have been discussed. [[32]](#cite_note-36) [Urine](/wiki/Urine_therapy), [feces](/wiki/Feces_therapy), [placenta](/wiki/Placentophagy) and other human-derived medicines were traditionally used [[3]](#cite_note-read-3) but some may no longer be in use. [[33]](#cite_note-37) Some of the dangerous ingredients lead oxide, cinnabar, and calomel are said for [detoxification](/wiki/Detox). [[42]](#cite_note-46) [[43]](#cite_note-47) [[44]](#cite_note-at-48) [[45]](#cite_note-bcmj-49) [[46]](#cite_note-ebm-50) Lead oxide help with ringworms, skin rashes, rosacea, eczema, sores, ulcers, and intestinal parasites, cinnabar allegedly helps you live longer, [[44]](#cite_note-at-48) [[45]](#cite_note-bcmj-49) and asbestos is used (including in powder form) for treating impotence, spermatorrhea, premature ejaculation, colic, muscle cramps, prostatitis, endometritis, as well as for kidney-warming and yang-fortifying. Admittedly, the amounts of cinnabar and calomel used in TCM are small enough that the damage they cause is usually reversible. [[46]](#cite_note-ebm-50) A 1998 study of 260 imported Asian patent medicines collected in California found that 14 had labels with declared pharmaceutical ingredients. [[47]](#cite_note-Ko-51) Of 243 products that were chemically analyzed, 17 had undeclared pharmaceuticals (including ephedrine, chlorpheniramine, methyltestosterone, and phenacetin). [[47]](#cite_note-Ko-51) Of the 251 products that were chemically analyzed, 24 contained lead in the range of 10 to 319 ppm, 35 contained [arsenic](/wiki/Arsenic) in the range of 20.4 to 114,000 ppm, and 35 contained [mercury](/wiki/Mercury) in the range of 22.4 to 5070 ppm. [[47]](#cite_note-Ko-51) By way of comparison, the United States Pharmacopoeia limits heavy metals in pharmaceuticals to 30 ppm in most cases. [[47]](#cite_note-Ko-51) Sites selling or promoting TCM remedies often lump all their products or recommended treatments under the generic term \"herbs\". However, many of these herbal products are really of mineral or otherwise non-herbal origin. These \"herbs\" are sometimes listed by their Chinese or mineral names (which people don't really recognize). Instead of listing \"lead\", they list a \"herb\" called mi tuo seng or \"galena\"; instead of listing asbestos, they list yang qi shi, and so on. Lethal substitution[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Traditional_Chinese_medicine&action=edit\u00a7ion=10)] TCM allows for the substitution of ingredients that have the same or similar names in Chinese. [[48]](#cite_note-52) In [Belgium](/wiki/Belgium), a weight-loss spa using TCM herbs gave its clients herbal supplements containing [birthwort](/wiki/Birthwort), and as a result, more than 100 out of 1800 of its patients developed kidney failure, and several also developed urothelial and kidney cancers. In this case, the relatively safe Stephania tetrandra (, Han Fang Ji) was intended for the clients, but the lethal Aristolochia fangchi (, Guang Fang Ji) was given to [[49]](#cite_note-53) Environmental impact[ prized; [[3]](#cite_note-read-3) rhino horns are considered [panaceas](/wiki/Panacea) which can cure everything from arthritis to [cancer](/wiki/Cancer), even though studies have shown they do nothing. [[50]](#cite_note-et-54) [[51]](#cite_note-55) [[52]](#cite_note-56) Because of this demand, poachers hunt these animals for their body parts in order to sell them to TCM users. Since the 1970s, rhino populations have dropped 90%; [[50]](#cite_note-et-54) while this number may not be entirely due to TCM, it can plausibly be said that TCM is significantly contributing to the extinction of endangered species by encouraging the use of these clearly ineffective as well as illegally and unsustainably sourced substances. Here be dragons[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Traditional_Chinese_medicine&action=edit\u00a7ion=12)] Some also grind up [dinosaur](/wiki/Dinosaur) [fossils](/wiki/Fossil) (mistakenly thought by some to be \" [dragon](/wiki/Dragon) bones\") to be used as medicines. [[53]](#cite_note-57) [[54]](#cite_note-58) [[55]](#cite_note-59) Given that dinosaur fossils have undergone complete mineralization, these \"dragon bones\" could not be any more effective than eating rocks.[citation NOT needed] Bernard Read analyzed several dragon medicines used |Chinese medicines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_traditional_Chinese_medicines)article [Wikipedia](/wiki/Wikipedia).
