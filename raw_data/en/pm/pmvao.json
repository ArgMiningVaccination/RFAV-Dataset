Believed to have originated in India as early as 3000 BCE, the art of meditation quickly became adopted by neighbouring countries and formed a part of many religions globally. Meditation is something every person can do, and different techniques work for different people. However, those wanting to learn the basics of how to meditate can follow these five simple steps. - Sit in a comfortable position with your body upright, legs crossed, and palms placed hands down on your knees. - Close your eyes or focus your gaze softly on something specific. - Breath in and out, letting your breath occur naturally and following it with your mind. - Be aware of how you are feeling in the moment and anytime you take your attention away from your breath, attempt to return your focus to it. - End your practice with gratitude and try to remain consciously present throughout your day. The Health Benefits of Meditation There are many benefits to practicing meditation regularly that can help improve your health and wellbeing. People who practice meditation report having reduced stress levels and increased concentration along with improved sleeping patterns. They also have more self-awareness which in turn helps them become more conscious of their daily habits and contributes to their overall wellbeing. Some studies even suggest that meditation could be linked to reducing age-related memory loss and enhancing cognitive performance in older adults. While the act of meditation itself is beneficial, there is a way to enhance your meditation practice by incorporating essential oils. Aromatherapy is a type of holistic healing treatment that uses essential oils to promote health and wellbeing. Humans have used aromatherapy since ancient times by incorporating aromatic plant components into balms and oils. These substances were known to have both psychological and physical benefits that were used for medicinal and religious purposes. Aromatherapy was particularly popular within Ancient Egypt with the Egyptians being generally regarded as the pioneers of the practice. For example, pure natural oils were important within Egyptian ceremonies and used to purify the air or as sacrifices to the gods. Essential Oils and Meditation Aromatherapy and meditation are an excellent pair as meditating with the scent of essential oils can deepen the meditative experience. Research shows that people who practice aromatherapy meditation report feeling more rested after sleep, improved memory, and increased creativity, in addition to less anxiety and greater happiness. Using essential oils while actively meditating reduces one's stress levels and therefore allows the opportunity to enter a deeper meditative state. Essential oils can be incorporated easily into meditation by either diffusing them into the air of the meditation space, rubbing them directly into the skin or using a room spray. The Best Essential Oils for Meditation While most essential oils are suitable to be used during meditation, some that can especially enhance your practice with various properties that will help reduce stress and anxiety. The following are considered to be the best essential oils for meditation. Sandalwood: Derived from the wood and roots of the East Indian sandalwood tree, sandalwood oil has been used for centuries in Ayurvedic medicine, traditional Chinese medicine, and folk medicine of India. Sandalwood boasts an earthy and warm scent that is commonly found in perfumes and has anxiolytic properties that help reduce anxiety. For example, one study has shown that sandalwood oil could reduce the stress levels of patients during a medical procedure, while another study found that participants' blood pressure levels were lower after experiencing aromatherapy with the oil. Frankincense: Often referred to as \"The King of Oils\", frankincense (also known as olibanum), is made from the resin of the Boswellia tree that grows in the mountainous regions of Africa, India, and the Middle East. This woody and spicy scented oil has been used for thousands of years throughout numerous cultures and its holistic benefits include reduced pain and inflammation, improved gut health, and improved oral health. Additionally, Frankincense is debatably the most recognized essential oil used for meditation, thanks to its ability to clear the mind and promote relaxation. Bergamot: Refreshing, sweet, and floral, bergamot oil is extracted from the rinds of citrus fruit that grow on bergamot orange trees in southern Italy. It is used to help with various skin ailments such as eczema and psoriasis and some believe it can also help with joint pain. Bergamot oil is also considered to relieve stress and anxiety as one study found that inhaling it for just 15-minutes can improve positive feelings.
