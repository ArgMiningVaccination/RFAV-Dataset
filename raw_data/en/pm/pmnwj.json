Although we strive to ensure that all information is accurate at the time of posting, please be aware that some items may be subject to change from time- to-time. The following list of drugs and indications that will be considered for funding under the Exceptional Access Program is not exhaustive. Physicians may wish to contact the EAP directly by phone at 416- 327-8109 or 1- 866-811-9893 or by email at EAPFeedback.MOH@ontario.ca to see if a specific drug product and or indication not listed below may be considered for EAP funding. Pharmacists and prescribers should be informed of a drug product's official indications and recommended dosage as set out in Health Canada's approved product monograph. Some aspects of the public funding criteria may differ from the official indications and recommended dosage as described in the product monographs for drug products that may be funded based on case- by-case approval through the Exceptional Access Program. The Executive Officer's funding of drug products is informed by advice from expert committees that consider evidence regarding the safety, clinical efficacy, and cost -effectiveness of the drug products. Where there is a difference between a product monograph and the reimbursement criteria described in this document, the published criteria governs for the purpose of funding under the Ontario Drug Benefit Program. The information provided in this document and website is intended for information pur poses only and does not provide any medical diagnosis, symptom assessment, health counselling or medical opinion for individual users. This information also does not constitute medical advice for physicians or patients. For more detailed information on prescription drugs, please consult a qualified healthcare professional. 3 Reimbursement Criteria for Frequently Requested Drugs and Indications For a drug to be considered for funding, the EAP reimbursement criteria must al ways be met and the request approved prior to the initiation of treatment with the drug being requested, unless otherwise specified within the criteria. This includes: funding for continued treatment that was previously supplied through a clinical trial, or paid for by other means (such as a third party payer) Note: First time applications for the funding of ongoing treatments must meet both initial and renewal criteria for the drug being requested (unless otherwise specified) funding for a renewal beyond the previously approved initial period, unless otherwise specified. Note that the terms \"fund\", \"funded\", or \"funding\" within this document are interpreted and applied by the Ministry in accordance with the clinical evidence used to establish the reimbursement criteria. The Ministry does not distinguish between the source of the drug funding (e.g. public or private payer[s]) in administering the EAP reimbursement criteria. Consider the following: The \"non- funding\" of specific combination treatments as identified by the criteria will not be reimbursed regardless of the funding source(s) of either therapy . The funding criteria are established based on the reviewed clinical evidence through the submission process and are not to be misconstrued with the source(s) of funding. Example 1: If drug A has approved reimbursement criteria and drug B has approved reimbursement criteria but the combination therapy of drug A plus drug B has not been reviewed through the established process and/or has no reimbursement criteria, the EAP will not fund either drug individually or as combination therapy if the intended use is for combination therapy, regardless of the actual source of funding of either drug A or drug B. Example 2: If drug A has approved reimbursement criteria and drug B does not have approved reimbursement criteria, and drug A used in combination with drug B does not have approved reimbursement criteria, funding for drug A will not be provided if the intent is to use drug A as combination with drug B, regardless of the source of funding for drug B. The duration of funding of a regimen identified in the criteria is in accordance with the duration of therapy supported by the clinical evidence and is not related to or dependent on source(s) of funding. Example 1: If the approved reimbursement criteria states that \"The Ministry will fund drug C for a period of 3 years\" and drug C was already used by the patient for 2 years funded by another payer (e.g. private payer, manufacturer, out -of-pocket), the Ministry will only be obliged to fund drug C for the remaining one year if the request meets the approved EAP reimbursement criteria. Such a limitation in the duration of funding is aligned with the clinical evidence provided to the Ministry at the time of the review. 4 For a limited number of requests where expert opinion is required, the requests are reviewed by an external reviewer who is a medical expert in the field. Where available, a link has been provided to the information page containing details of the Committee to Evaluate Drugs (CED) review and subsequent the Executive Officer's funding decision for the particular drug and indication . Information on whether the drug and indication can be considered through the Telephone Request Service (TRS) is also included. EAP requests may be submitted for numerous other drugs not listed below, or for drugs listed below but for different indications . However, EAP funding will only be considered for drugs and indications that have been reviewed by the CED and approved for funding by the Executive Officer . For more information, please refer to the main EAP webpage . Some of the drugs considered through EAP are also listed on the ODB Formulary for a different indication as Limited Use (LU) benefit. You can check whether the drug is listed by searching the e-Formulary . For details on how the EAP reimbursement criteria are developed, please refer to the main EAP webpage . To assist physicians applying for exceptional access, the ministry has developed a standard form . Use of form is not mandatory but does facilitate provision of all relevant information . Where applicable, please ensure that all relevant clinical information is provided demonstrating that the patient meets the reimbursement criteria. Note: The dosage form and strength of the product that has been approved for reimbursement consideration are those that have been approved by the Committee to Evaluate Drugs (CED) . In most cases, these are the dosage forms and strengths submitted to the CED by the manufacturer for consideration, however, it may not be inclusive of all dosage forms and strengths available through the manufacturer. 5 Biosimila r Policy and the Reimbursement of Biologic Originators through The Exceptional Access Program (Until March 30, 2023 then Refer to the Biosimilar Switch Policy) Reimbursement for Remicade\u00ae, Enbrel\u00ae, Humira\u00ae, Rituxan\u00ae, and Copaxone\u00ae (not a biologic but a complex molecule included under this policy) through the Ontario Drug Benefit (ODB) program is provided only for eligible ODB recipients who are treatment experienced on a case -by-case basis. All patients must meet specified initiation criteria and renewal criteria associated with the treatment depending on the duration of use of the biologic by the patient . This requirement must be met irrespective of whether the drug was originally funded through a private health insurance plan, a clinical trial, compassionately by another payer, accessed in another country or jurisdiction, or paid for out-of-pocket and it is intended to optimize consistency and equity of funding for Ontarians in accordance with the evidence- review process es. Patients who are treatment na\u00efve to the biologic are funded for the biosimilar version for its Health Canada approved indications. The biosimilar version of these drugs can be accessed as a limited use benefit upon meeting specified criteria for their Health Canada approved indications . If a request does not meet the LU criteria on the ODB formulary, case- by-case consideration may be provided through the EAP. Patients must be provided with a new prescription and meet the Limited Use Criteria or Exceptional Access Program criteria to be publicly reimbursed for either the biologic originator or its biosimilar versions . The biosimilar version is generally available for all its Health Canada approved indications on the ODB formulary as a limited use benefit. Additionally, requests for a biologic for indications where Health Canada has not granted notice of compliance for the biologic originator or the biosimilar versions, if approved for funding through a case -by-case process, will be granted access to the biologic originator and the biosimilar versions. Please visit the Ministry website to view the more detailed information pertaining to each biologic originator/biosimilar announcement in the Executive Officer Communication Notices. Frequently Asked Questions pertaining to each biologic/drug at the time of implementation are also found on the Ministry website. http://www.health.gov.on.ca/en/pro/programs/drugs/opdp_eo/eo_communiq.aspx You can find the limited use criteria associated with funded biosimilars on the e- formulary or the latest version of the Ontario Drug Benefit Formulary. The searchable electronic formulary is available at the following URL on the Drugs and Devices Division's website: https://www.formulary.health.gov.on.ca/formulary/ 6 Biosimilar Switching Policy (Effective March 31, 2023) The Ontario government is expanding its biologic drug coverage policy to further promote the use of bi osimilars funded through the Ontario Drug Benefit (ODB) program. As a key health system partner, the Ministry of Health (\"the ministry\") is seeking support from pharmacists in the implementation of this policy. These changes support the Ministry's objectiv es of creating a modern and sustainable drug system that continues to offer high- quality treatment, while allowing the government to fund more new drug therapies, bring innovation to the health care system and continue its work to deliver better, connected patient care. What are the changes in drug coverage for biologics? In general, effective March 31, 2023, the ODB program will start transitioning As new biosimilars enter the Canadian market, these biosimilars and their corresponding originator biologic drugs may be included as part of this policy change. Effective December 29, 2023, coverage for these originator biologic drugs through the ODB program will not be available for patients and the ODB program will only provide coverage for the biosimilar version of these drugs for all ODB program recipients, wi th limited exemptions (see below). In general, for ODB program recipients who are already on these biologic drugs, there is up to a 9- month transition period (see below for more information). Note: The ministry is aware of the ongoing Admelog shortage. The ministry will continue to monitor the situation. P rescribers will be expected to transition patients once the supply issues are resolved. The ministry will continue to communicate with healthcare providers . This biosimilars switching policy does not apply to coverage outside of the ODB program, including private drug plans and prescriptions paid out -of-pocket. However, the biosimilar switching p olicy will apply to patients transitioning from other coverage types to the ODB program; such patients who are on originator biologic drugs subject to the biosimilar switching p olicy will need to transition to a biosimilar version to receive coverage for these biologic drugs under the ODB program, with exemptions. 1 Glatect\u00ae and Copaxone\u00ae are non-biologic complex drugs (NBCDs), however, the biosimilars switching p olicy will apply to their funding. As a result, in this document, references to an originator biologic include Copaxone\u00ae and references to a biosimilar the biosimilar switching policy . No biosimilar is available for this strength. 7 Transition period ODB program recipients on any of the drugs listed above will be required to transition to a biosimilar version to continue receiving coverage for their medication under the ODB program, unless they meet a medically necessary exemption. A transition period of up to nine months, beginning March 31, 2023, will be granted for ODB program recipients (including existing Exceptional Access Program (EAP) recipients) to provide an opportunit y for patients and their health care professionals to discuss biosimilar transition. EAP approvals for Copaxone \u00ae, Enbrel\u00ae, Humira\u00ae, Remicade\u00ae or Rituxan\u00ae expiring between March 31, 2023, and June 29, 2023, will be extended to June 30, 2023. The purpose of this extension is to give prescribers adequate time to contact their patients and discuss the transition to the biosimilar version or to determine if the patient may require a medically necessary exemption. Patients with EAP approvals for Copaxone \u00ae, Enbrel\u00ae, Humira\u00ae, Remicade\u00ae or Rituxan\u00ae expiring after June 29, 2023, will be required to transition to a biosimilar by the expiry date of their EAP approval OR December 28, 2023, whichever is earlier, in order to continue receiving ODB program coverage for these biologics . Prescribers are being asked to contact their patients to discuss transitioning to a biosimilar version of their medication and will need to write a new prescription. Prescribers should access the biosimilar for their patients on the ODB Formulary by using an eligible Limited Use (LU) code as applicable. Medically Necessary Exemptions for Formulary Biologics Medically necessary exemptions to this policy may be granted on a case- by-case b asis through the EAP. Note that patients are generally expected to trial at least two biosimilars of the originator biologic before a request to the EAP will be considered to resume funding of the originator product. D uring the transition period of March 3 1, 2023, to December 28, 2023, prescribers with patients requiring medically necessary exemptions to this policy for Lantus\u00ae, NovoRapid\u00ae, and Humalog\u00ae may include the corresponding temporary LU codes on their prescriptions, but only if the patient is currently established on the originator biologic . As of December 29, 2023, the temporary LU codes will be removed and any medically necessary exemptions for Lantus \u00ae, NovoRapid\u00ae, and Humalog\u00ae will need to be submitted to the EAP for case -by-case consideration. Prescribers are encouraged to submit EAP requests as soon as possible during the transition period to avoid a gap in coverage. As of December 29, 2023, access to Enbrel\u00ae and Humira\u00ae for plaque psoriasis will be discontinued and that indication will be removed from the ODB Formulary. Requests for patients requiring medically necessary exemptions to this policy for Enbrel\u00ae or Humira\u00ae for plaque psoriasis will need to be submitted to the EAP. 8 Table of Contents ANEM IA .......................................................................................................................... 16 Darbepoetin ................................................................................................................ 35 Fidaxomicin (May be accessed through the telephone request service) ..................... 38 Isavuconazole ............................................................................................................. 97 Obeticholic Acid ..........................................................................................................

Preamble: A confirmed diagnosis of atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) is required for eculizumab funding. The information below is to provide clinicians with context for how a diagnosis of aHUS will be assessed for funding consideration. Details to address these issues should be provided in the funding request. While some patients may already have a confirmed aHUS diagnosis, by clinical history and/or genetic testing, the majority of patients presenting with thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) have no prior diagnosis of aHUS. For most patients presenting with a TMA, it is not possible to confidently separate aHUS from the vast majority of other conditions causing TMA until after appropriate testing and treatment have occurred. The majority of patients who have TMA suffer from Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP) (30- 40%), or a secondary form of TMA (e.g., pregnancy, HIV, collagen vascular disease, drugs, malignancy, stem cell transplant, malignant hypertension) (> 50%), or hemolytic uremic syndrome due to a Shiga toxin (>5%). In most cases, patients who suffer from TTP will have an ADAMTS -13 of less than 10%. If TTP has been ruled out and any secondary causes have been treated and the patient still has a persisting unexplained TMA with ADAMTS- 13 10%, the patient would be presumed to suffer from aHUS. Patients who present wi th ADAMTS- 13 of 10% and who are unresponsive to plasma therapy (>4 plasma exchanges) and do not have a known secondary explanation would also be presumed to suffer from aHUS. In the absence of a confirmed diagnosis of aHUS, there is nothing in these criteria that changes the clinical expectation for appropriate use of plasma exchange/plasma infusion in the management of patients presenting with TMA. Initiation Criteria A patient must meet all three of the following criteria to obtain funding for initial t reatment with eculizumab: 1. Confirmed diagnosis* of atypical DOSAGE FORM/ STRENGTH: 10 mg/mL (300 mg per vial) 64 a. non- diss -13 activity 10% on blood samples taken prior to plasma exchange or plasma infusion (PE/PI); Note: If the sample for ADAMTS -13 was not collected prior to PE or PI, platelet counts > 30 x 109/L and eGFR < 50 mL/min/1.73m2 at TMA presentation will be accepted as predictive of ADAMTS- 13 10% in TMA patients . In this case, measurement of ADAMTS -13 can be taken 1- 2 weeks following the last PE. The ADAMTS -13 result must be provided within 30 days of commencement of eculizumab and at least 1 week after the last PE. A one- month interim funding for eculizumab will be provided. AND c. STEC -negative test in patients with a history of bloody diarrhea in the preceding two weeks; AND d. Other diagnoses and causes of TMA must be ruled out, as per preamble. 2. Evidence of ongoing active and progressing TMA as defined by: a. Thrombocytopenia (platelet count <150 x 109/L) that is not explained by some other cause including secondary TMA; AND hemolysis as indicated by the documentation of two of the following: red blood cell (RBC) fragmentation (schistocytes) on the blood film; low or absent haptoglobin; or lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) above normal; OR b. Tissue biopsy confirming TMA in patients who do not have evidence of platelet consumption and hemolysis. Note: Review by external clinical expert may be required to assess requests for patients with ongoing TMA that may not clearly meet the above criteria. 3. Evidence of at least one of the following documented clinical features of active organ damage or impairment: a. Kidney impairment as demonstrated by one of the following: o A decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) or a rise in serum creatinine (SrCr) of >20% in a 10 mg/mL (300 mg per vial) o SrCr > upper limit of normal (ULN) for age or eGFR < 60mL/min in patients who have no history of pre- existing renal impairment (i.e., who have no baseline eGFR measurement); OR o SrCr > the age- appropriate ULN in pediatric patients (subject to advice from a pediatric nephrologist); or o Renal biopsy; OR b. Onset of neurological impairment related to TMA (e.g., visual field defect, hemiparesis, sensory loss, asymmetric limb weakness, confusion, loss of consciousness/coma, new onset seizure). Note: Patients who have extra- renal complications related to TMA (e.g., TMA -related cardiac impairment, TMA -related gastrointestinal impairment, or TMA -related pulmonary impairment) will be reviewed by an external clinical ex pert. Continuation Criteria (at 6 months) After six months of eculizumab therapy, a further six month of funding will be considered if the patient demonstrates treatment response, defined as: Hematological normalization (platelet count, LDH, haptoglobin); AND An improvement or stabilization of eGFR (or SrCr); AND Stabilization of neurological or extra- renal impairment if these complications were originally present. Continued treatment with eculizumab will not be funded beyond six months if a patient has experienced treatment failure, defined as: Dialysis -dependent at six months, and failed to demonstrate resolution or stabilization of neurological or extra- renal complications if these were originally present; OR On dialysis for four of the previous six mo nths while receiving eculizumab and failed to demonstrate resolution or stabilization of neurological or extra- renal complications if these were originally present; OR 66 Eculizumab Brand(s): Soliris DOSAGE FORM/ STRENGTH: 10 mg/mL (300 mg per vial) Worsening of kidney function with a reduction in eGFR or increase in SrCr 25% from baseline. Approval duration: 6 months Continuation Criteria (at 12 months): 1. Ongoing treatment response as defined in the 6- month continuation criteria; AND 2. The patient has limited organ reserve defined as: Significant cardiomyopathy, neurological, gastrointestinal or pulmonary impairment related to TMA; or Grade 4 or 5 chronic kidney disease (eGFR <30mL/min). (Note: Patients who are dialysis - dependent with no significant extra- renal manifestations persisting are not considered). There may be other exceptional circumstances where the patient has a high risk of recurrence and in whom consequences of a relapse are significant (e.g., complement Factor H genetic mutation, multiple clinical presentations of active TMA). These will be reviewed on a case- by-case basis by an external clinical expert. For patients in whom a pause in therapy is recommended, funding will be left in place for 3 months so that eculizumab can be quickly restarted upon evidence of recurrence per recommencement criteria. Approval duration: 12 months Recommencement Criteria: A patient previously diagnosed with aHUS and who responded to treatment with eculizumab and has not failed eculizumab is eligible to restart eculizumab if the following clinical conditions are met: Significant hemolysis as evidenced by presence of schistocytes on the blood film, or low or absent haptoglobin, or LDH above normal; AND EITHER Platelet consumption as measured by either 25% decline from patient baseline or thrombocytopenia (platelet count FORM/ 10 mg/mL (300 mg per vial) 67 TMA -related organ impairment (e.g., unexplained rise in serum creatinine with onset of urine dipstick positive for hemoglobin) including on recent biopsy. Note: 1. Raised LDH alone is not a sufficient reason to recommence eculizumab, but thrombocytopenia with one marker of hemolysis (such as raised LDH, presence of schistocytes, or low/absence of haptoglobin) is an accepted reason to recommence. 2. Kidney transplantation/dialysis is not a contraindication to recommencement. A patient who becomes eligible to restart eculizumab, in accordance with the above criteria, will be assessed every 6 months for treatment response or failure. Approval duration: 6 months Patients undergoing kidney transplantation: For patients with a confirmed aHUS diagnosis who are undergoing kidney transplantation, eculizumab funding will be provided for the time period immediately prior to (or at time of) transplant.

Th e TRS offers prescribers (i.e. physicians and nurse practitioners) another way to submit EAP requests for a group of selected drugs. This document provides a list of the drugs and their funding criteria that are considered through the TRS. In most cases , the request will be assessed during the call and a funding decision provided to the caller by the end of the call. In general, approvals will be processed within one business day turnaround. Prescribers (or their delegates) are encouraged to review the reimbursement criteria for the drug being requested before calling the service to ensure that all of the necessary information is available during the call. Callers who wish to submit a request for drug products and indications not currently available through TRS will be asked to fax the request to EAP. If your request is approved, the prescriber will receive a response letter notifying him/her of the funding decision. The EAP response letter will list the specific drug, drug identification number (DIN) or product identification number (PIN), strength and dosage form that is considered for funding. Prescribers and pharmacists are responsible to ensure that funded products are provided to avoid unnecessary out -of-pocket costs to the patient. Note that not all generic brands are funded or interchangeable (on- formulary or off -formulary). You can also refer to the formulary for a list of the most updated interchangeable drugs products. The Ministry reserves the right to change the list of drug products at its sole discretion.
