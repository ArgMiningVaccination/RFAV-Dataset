Increasing attention paid to the ancillary \"nursemaid\" cells Microglia Astrocytes Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) Clear, colorless fluid occupying subarachnoid space and ventricular system around and inside the brain, spinal cord Produced by ependymal cells in choroid plexus Cushions/buffers cortex Provides basic mechanical and immunological protection to the brain inside the skull Vital to cerebral autoregulation and blood flow 5/3/2021 3Basic Functions of CSF Buoyancy Protection Chemical stability* Removes metabolic waste from CNS through BBB, allows for homeostatic regulation of neuroendocrine factors Waste removal* Flows throughout ventricles and absorbed back into bloodstream Prevention of brain ischemia -related to ICP and blood perfusion Why focus on CSF? Gives us meaningful information about the brain behind the BBB Measuring biomarkers is critical to understanding pathology in living people Important for ruling out other pathologies such as MS, infection, etc. Changes in biomarkers typically occur before symptom onset Well studied in millions of people across disease spectrum Not ethnically diverse samples! Significant sensitivity to diagnose AD (~90%): Amyloid levels typically low Tau and phospho -tau elevated Decent specificity to rule out AD (~70 -80%) Could have prodromal AD? Lumbar Puncture (LP) No anticoagulation (Aspirin 81mg is OK) Outpatient procedure takes about 30 min Lidocaine to numb the skin People typically recover in 2 -24 hrs Monitor for headaches 5/3/2021 4Biomarkers \"A defined characteristic that is measured as an indicator of normal biological processes, pathogenic processes, or responses to an exposure or intervention, including therapeutic interventions\" -FDA-NIH Reliable indicators of presence of disease Combination of fluid and imaging (current) Challenges: Patients may be reluctant to have LP Insurance may deny covering \"fancy\" imaging Timing -the disease process has already begun by the time these abnormal biomarkers are discovered A/T/N Classification 7 major biomarkers of interest in ADRD research A: value of -amyloid Either amyloid PET or CSF A -42 T: value of tau Either tau PET or CSF phospho -tau N: -PET , structural MRI, or CSF total tau Each category is either (+) or ( -) Example: Individual results would appear 5/3/2021 5Microglia \"First responders\" Small with \"thorny\" processes which can touch neighboring neurons Can transform into macrophages to clear debris, waste Clear A and tau Monitor health of neurons by detecting injuries to neurons Astrocytes Star-shaped glial cells Cover nearly all capillaries in CNS Support BBB Keep toxins out of brain Provide nutrients to neurons Repair tissue after injury Regulate neuronal communication by recycling neurotransmitters released during synaptic transmission Regulate external chemical environment by removing excess ions Biomarkers of Synapse or Neuronal Loss Neurofilament Light Chain ( NfL) very sensitive to AD onset Released into extracellular space when neurons degenerate Neurogranin (Ng) Post -synaptic protein concentrated in dendritic spines, hippocampus Elevated early in disease progression Localized at epicenter of pathogenic events in AD 5/3/2021 6Biomarkers of Inflammation and Microglia \"Dysfunction\" \"Chicken or the egg\" Part of original pathogenesis? Or reaction to amyloid and tau deposition? Soluble TREM2 Triggering Receptor Expressed on Myeloid Cells 2 Expressed on microglia in the brain Regulates immune cell activation after ligand binding (including APOE and A ) Regulates cytokines activation YKL-40 Glycoprotein expressed in astrocytes and microglia Plays a role in inflammation and tissue remodeling Biomarkers of Related Disorders TAR DNA -Binding Protein 43 (TDP -43) Present in up to 50% of AD cases Main feature of FTD and ALS Alpha -synuclein Key component of Lewy Bodies, Parkinson's Disease, multi -system atrophy (MSA) Involved in pre -synaptic signaling Vascular Damage and BBB Vascular damage is large component of AD Microvascular damage often seen (Mixed -dementia) Key Point Although we cannot control our genetics or history, we can control blood pressure, diet, exercise Aggressive BP control to prevent microvascular damage! American Heart Association 5/3/2021 7Observational Studies No intervention Pro: generally lower time commitment, no new drugs or s/e, great for \"healthy controls\" Con: no change to disease trajectory May include: Collection of body fluids (LP) Imaging (MRI, PET -CT) Cognitive testing EEG Wearable technology ( FitBit )Interventional Studies Testing investigational drug/device Pro: may benefit patient, feeling of hope Con: false hope, may receive placebo, can be time -intensive, strict I/E criteria May include: Oral, IV, or SQ medications Placebo vs. \"active\" drug Activities from observational studies New research on old drugs Thinking outside the box New drugs are expensive and time -consuming to develop How can we repurpose already , play Lumosity games, answer questions about their sleep, mood, etc. Great way to determine whether a drug helps an individual Double -blind multi -crossover design allows for participant to serve as their own control 5/3/2021 8BCG Vaccine Pilot Study Bacillus Calmette -Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) has \"off -target\" effects Bladder cancer Type 1 Diabetes Influences regulatory T -cells (Tregs) of the innate immune system Can BCG increase neurotrophins and decrease neurotoxins? Activity Screening Visit Baseline Visit/ BCG Vaccine 1 BCG Vaccine 2 Outcome Visit <-28days Day 1 Day 28 +14 days Day 84 \u00b15 days BCG Vaccination x x Vaccination Site Monitoring x x x Safety Lab Tests3 x x Blood Draw for Biomarkers4 x x x COVID -19 Testing5 x Fasting Lumbar Puncture for Biomarkers4 x x Describe Skin Lesions Induration: 2 -4 weeks after vaccine Pustule formation: 5 -7 weeks Scar formation: 2 -3 months Importance of Diversity in Research Most studies include primarily white patients Skewed towards more affluent patients How does this influence our data? We don't know how incomplete the picture is Without representation, drugs that could help diverse patients may not \"perform\" well enough 5/3/2021 9Trusting Relationships Crucial to develop trusting relationships with the community Working against challenges of institutionalized racism and history of mistreatment by the medical community Takes time but it's worthwhile! Community service that can be sustained Meet people where they are -church, grocery store, community centers thank you Lisa Quinn, PhD, AGACNP -BC, OCN Email: LQuinn@mghihp.edu "}
