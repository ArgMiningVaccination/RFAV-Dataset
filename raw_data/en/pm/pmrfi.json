Where a district boundary line divides a lot at the time such line is adopted, the regulations for the less restricted portion of such lot shall extend not more than twenty-five (25) feet into the more restricted portion, provided the lot has frontage on a street in the less restricted district. Further, the exact location of where the line crosses the property shall be determined by the Plan Administrator. F. The vacation of streets and roads shall not affect the location of such district boundaries. G. When the Plan Administrator cannot definitely determine the location of a district boundary by such center lines, by scale or dimensions stated on the Official Zoning Map, or by the fact that it does not clearly coincide with a property line, the Administrator shall refuse action and the Plan Commission shall interpret the location of the district boundary with reference to the scale of the Official Zoning Map and the purposes set forth in all relevant provisions of this Ordinance. H. Any ruling of the Plan Administrator pertaining to the district boundaries may be appealed to the Board of Zoning Appeals. I. Where a discrepancy exists between the depictions on the Official Zone Map and the text of a le - gal description accompanying an ordinance for zone map change duly adopted by the City or Town Council, the text of the legal description shall control.3-5 Article Three: Zone Map3-1.8 Zoning of Newly Annexed Land All real property annexed into the incorporated areas of Fulton County, Indiana, after the effective date of this Ordinance, shall be considered zoned the same District as the most appropriate District of the prop - erty requested to be annexed. The most appropriate district shall be determined by the Plan Administra - tor. Any ruling of the Plan Administrator pertaining to the most appropriate district may be appealed to the Board of Zoning Appeals. In those instances in which the Owner of real property proposed for annexation into the incorporated areas of Fulton County desires annexation only if the zoning of the real property is zoned to a District other than that determined to be the most appropriate District, such Owner may file a petition for zone map change which would identify the real property and the requested District. The legislative body of the incorporated area shall consider the request for annexation and zone map change at a combined hearing and shall determine the annexation question and zone map change under a single combined vote. The Plan Commission and the legislative bodies of Fulton County shall have all powers delegated to them by Indiana Code 36-7-4 et seq., and this Ordinance in determining the zone map change.3-6 Fulton County Zoning Ordinance Article Four Zone Districts3-2 Fulton County Zoning Ordinance4-3 Article Four: Zone Districts 3-4 Fulton County Zoning OrdinanceAG District 4-1.1 \"AG\" District Intent, Permitted Uses, and Special Exception Uses District Intent The \"AG\" (Agriculture) District is intended to provide a land use category for agricultural activities. The provisions that regulate this land use district should protect, promote and maintain areas in Ful - ton County for farming operations. Non-agriculture uses that are located within this zoning district may not object to any permitted agriculture use, whether such uses currently exist, are enlarged, or change in the future to another agricultural use.

A site development plan showing existing and proposed structure locations and existing and proposed land grades. d. Elevation of lowest floor (including basement) of all proposed structures. D. As required by state law, if the site is located in the floodway, the petitioner must receive per - mission from IDNR to do any excavation, deposits, construction or obstruction activity . a. The floodway is defined by the National Flood Insurance Program flood boundary and floodway map. b. If the site is known to be or is potentially in the floodway the plan administrator shall require the applicant to forward all pertinent plans and specifications to IDNR and apply for a permit for construction in a floodway. This includes land preparation such as filling, 5-19 Article Five: Development Standards grading, clearing, and paving, etc. undertaken before the actual start of construction of the building. c. No action shall be taken by the plan administrator until a permit has been granted by IDNR granting approval for construction in a floodway, or IDNR issues a letter stating the pro - posed activity is not within the floodway and/or under its jurisdiction. d. The plan administrator may issue a Location Improvement Permit but only if the other pro - visions in this section (FP-01) have been met. E. If the site is in the floodway fringe, the petitioner may receive a Location Improvement Per - mit for the permitted uses discussed in \"A\" of this section.

All other provisions in this section (FP-01) shall be complied with. b. All structures (finished floor elevation) are required to be constructed, two (2) feet above the regulatory flood plain elevation. Fill cannot be used to achieve this requirement. F. Under no circumstance shall there be a net loss of flood water capacity. No development shall be permitted which acting alone or in combination with existing or future similar works will cause any increase in the elevation of the regulatory flood. G. The Fulton County Board of Zoning Appeals when hearing variance requests from this section of the Ordinance shall consider the following in addition to the criteria set forth in this ordi - nance: a. The potential damage to belongings of all those that may be affected by a flood not just the property or building owner. b. The increased flood hazard to other structures and properties in the surrounding area that may be caused by building the proposed structure. c. Whether the site is subject to more frequent flooding than the 100-year flood. d. Whether there are other options for locating the structure. e. The applicant shall demonstrate the necessity of the particular use or structure within the floodplain. 5-1.10 Home Occupation Standards (HO) HO-01: Home Occupation #1: The intent of the Home Occupation #1 provisions are to allow minimal business practices within certain Zoning Districts.

For this reason, this Article has been generated to provide the rules, policies and regulations that apply to these buildings, structures, lots, and uses referred to as Legal Nonconforming. 8-1.2 Distinction Between Illegal Nonconforming and Legal Nonconforming A building, structure, or lot which was constructed or is being used without an approved Building Permit, Location Improvement Permit or approval from the BZA or Plan Commission is considered illegal nonconforming. An illegal nonconforming property shall be subject to actions and penalties allowed by this Ordinance and all other applicable County law and shall be altered to conform with all applicable standards and regulations of this Ordinance. Further, an illegal nonconforming build - ing, structure, lot or use is created at the fault of the owner, tenant or property manager. Legal Nonconforming differs from Illegal Nonconforming in that the reason for the nonconformance is caused by the enactment of a Zoning Ordinance or a change to the Zoning Ordinance. The build - ing, structure, lot or use has not changed, but due to the enactment of a Zoning Ordinance or a change in the Ordinance, the property no longer conforms to the policies and standards of the Zoning District in which the property resides. When this situation occurs, the property is deemed Legal Nonconform - ing or another term commonly used is \"Grandfathered.\" 8-1.3 Nonconforming Buildings, Structures, and Uses of Land Any continuously occupied, lawfully established structure, building, or uses of land prior to the effective date of this Ordinance, or its subsequent amendments, that no longer meets the develop - mental standards due to reasons stated below shall be deemed a Legal Nonconforming Building(s), Structure(s), or Use of Land.

Maximum Lot Coverage, c. Minimum Main Floor Area, d. Minimum Finished Floor Area, e. Height, f. Bufferyard, g. Parking, h. Accessory Structures/Buildings, and j. Any other provision of this Ordinance that is applicable to the building, structure, or use of land. A legal nonconforming building, structure, or use of land may continue provided that it remains the same or fits within the below described tolerances: A. Any legal nonconforming building(s), structure(s), or use(s) of land shall not be enlarged or altered in a manner that increases its nonconformity, but any building(s), structure(s), or use(s) of land, or portion thereof, may be altered to decrease its nonconformity.8-4 Fulton County Zoning Ordinance B. Any legal nonconforming building(s) or structure(s) which is damaged or destroyed by more than seventy-five percent (75%) of its fair market value shall thereafter conform to the regulations of the district in which it is located. The above stated seventy-five percent (75%) of the fair market value does not include any damage or destruction that is self-imposed. Primary residential structures and churches are exempt from the seventy-five percent (75%) rule. However, if the structure is rebuilt the nonconformity cannot increase (i.e. must have same ground floor square footage or less). a. The Gross Floor Area and the Maximum Building Height devoted to the Legally Established Nonconforming Use shall not be increased, except as such increase is required to comply with other applicable Federal, State or Local regulations (i.e., minor enlargements to accommodate ADA Accessibility Guidelines or current Building Codes). C. If a building or structure is moved for any reason, for any distance, it shall thereafter conform to the provisions of this Ordinance. 8-1.4 Front, Side and Rear Yard Setback Exceptions The minimum Side and Rear Yard Setback requirements for a Lot containing a Single Family or Two Family Dwelling in a Residential District shall be subject to the following exceptions: A. A Legally Established Nonconforming, detached, Accessory Garage may be reconstructed on an existing foundation even though such reconstruction would not comply with required Side or Rear Yards, provided such reconstruction does not interfere with a Vision Clearance Area or encroach into any Right-of-Way. B. A Legally Established Nonconforming Single Family or Two Family Dwelling (including decks and porch attributes) may be enlarged or extended one time along a Legally Established Nonconforming Front, Side or Rear Yard provided that the lineal footage of such enlargement or extension does not exceed fifty percent (50%) of the lineal footage of the original dimension of the Single Family or Two Family Dwelling along that front, side, or rear setback, provided such enlargement or extension does not interfere with a Vision Clearance area or encroach into any Right-of-Way. None of such exten - sions described may get closer than the original footprint to the existing property line. 8-1.5 Nonconforming Lots of Record All legally established and recorded lots prior to the effective date of this Ordinance, or its subsequent amendments, that no longer meet the lot standards listed below shall be deemed a Legal Nonconforming Lot of Record. A Legal Nonconforming Lot of Record no longer meets one or more of the following lot standards of this Ordinance. a. Lot Area, b. Lot Width, c. Lot Depth, d. Lot Frontage, and e. Any other provision of this Ordinance that is applicable to Lots. A. Legal Nonconforming Lots of Record may be built upon only if the proposed use is permitted and all development standards of the applicable Zoning District of this Ordinance are met. 8-1.6 Nonconforming Uses of Structures, Land, or Structures and Land in Combination Any continuous, lawful use of structures, land, or structures and land in combination established prior to the effective date of this Ordinance or its subsequent amendments that is no longer a permitted use in the district where it is located shall be deemed a Legal Nonconforming Use.

In the case of a legal nonconforming use of structure, the structure may be expanded up to a total of twenty percent (20%) of the floor area on the date of adoption of this Ordinance. Any expansion(s) equaling twenty percent (20%), or less, of the total floor area existing on the date of adoption of this Ordinance shall conform to all applicable development standards, unless a variance of developmental standards is received from the Board of Zoning Appeals. With the exception that if the expansion will create additional parking or loading requirements than the previous use, such new use will comply with the requirements of the development standards of this Ordinance, unless a variance from de - velopmental standards is granted by the Board of Zoning Appeals. Any expansion(s) equaling more than twenty percent (20%) of a structure used in conjuction with a legal nonconforming use, must then conform to all of the regulations within the Fulton County Zoning Ordinance. (i.e. Zone District permitted uses, special exception uses, development standards, etc.); otherwise B. No existing structure devoted to a legal nonconforming use shall be enlarged, expanded, increased, extended, constructed, reconstructed, moved, or structurally altered except as to change the use of the structure to a use permitted in the district in which it is located or as otherwise specified in this Article; and C. No building or structure shall be constructed in connection with an existing legal nonconforming use of land, until such time that the building or structure conforms with the Fulton County Zoning Ordi - nance. D. Any legal nonconforming use of a structure may be extended throughout any parts of a building which were plainly arranged or designed for such use at the effective date of this Ordinance or its sub - sequent amendments, but no such use shall be extended to occupy any land outside the building. E. If no structural alterations are made, a legal nonconforming use of structure, or structure and land in combination, may be changed to another legal nonconforming use, provided that the zoning adminis - trator shall make specific findings that the proposed use is equally appropriate or more appropriate to the district than the existing legal nonconforming use. With the exception that if the new use requires more parking or loading area than the previous use, such new use will comply with the requirements of the development standards of this Ordinance, unless a variance from developmental standards is granted by the Board of Zoning Appeals. F. If a legal nonconforming use is discontinued or abandoned for two (2) years, except when govern - ment action impedes access to the premises, any subsequent use of such land, structure or land and structure shall conform to the provisions of this Ordinance. G. When a legal nonconforming use is superseded by a permitted use, it shall thereafter conform to regu - lations of the district , the legal nonconforming use may not thereafter be resumed. H. Where a legal nonconforming use applies to a structure and land in combination, removal or destruc - tion of the structure shall eliminate both the nonconforming use of the structure and the land. Destruc - tion is defined as damage of more than seventy-five percent (75%) of its fair market value at the time of destruction. I. When a mobile home is legally nonconforming due to the size and type of structure, it may only be replaced by a structure that conforms with its zoning district. 8-1.7 Repairs and Maintenance The following applies to legal nonconforming structures or buildings, and legal nonconforming uses of structures, or structures and land in combination: A. Work may be done for ordinary repairs or replacement of walls, heating, fixtures, wiring, or plumb - ing; under the condition that the cubic content existing when the structure became nonconforming shall not be increased. B. If a structure or portion of a structure were to become unsafe or condemned due to lack of repairs 8-6 Fulton County Zoning Ordinance or maintenance, and is declared by an authorized official to be unsafe or condemned due to physical condition; the building or structure shall be restored, repaired or rebuilt within six (6) months of the declaration. If the improvements have not been made within the six (6) months, all future improve - ments must conform to all standards and regulations within this ordinance. C. If a building or structure becomes unsafe or unlawful due to physical condition and is razed, the build - ing or structure shall be rebuilt in conformity with the district in which it is located. D. Nothing in this Section shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening, repairing, or restoring to a safe condition of any building or structure or part thereof declared to be unsafe by any official charged with protecting public safety upon order of such official. 8-1.8 Avoidance of Undue Hardship.
