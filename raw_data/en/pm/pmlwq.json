Historically, the inundation of floodplain w etland s has been viewed as negatively impacting flora and fauna and as a hazard to humans (Resh et al. 1988). In fact, m assive engineering e fforts have been undertaken to regulate floodplain inundation. However, recen t studies have revealed that inundation is an essential interaction between the river and its f loodplai n that enhances biol ogical productivity and maintains diversity (Junk et al. 1989, W ard et al. 1999, Bayley 1995, Sparks 1995, Tockner et al. 2000, Benke 2001). The high productivity and bi odiversity characteristic of rive rine wetlands is due, in large part, to the m any-fold increase in aqua tic area that occurs upon inundation (Junk et al. 1989, Bayley 1995). The lateral \"puls e\" of flood water carries nutrient-r ich subsidies between the river and its floodplain, and has been postulated to driv e productivity of fish an d invertebrates in the river channel (Junk et al. 1989, Bayley 1995, Benke 2001). The nature of pulses into floodplains will chang e depending o n clim ate an d the size and position of the r iver in the wate rshed (Tockner et al. 2000). In the low-gradient rivers of th e southeastern U.S., the pattern of flooding and drying (i.e. the hydroperiod) changes char acter along a longitudinal gradient of river discharge throughout a waters hed, with headwater-associ ated floodplains flooding less predictably and for shorter durations, and with floodplains in lower reach es flooding more predictably and for longer durations (Bed inger 1981, Benke 2001) (Fig. 1, Table 1). Aquatic invertebrates in floodplain wetlands function as important interm ediaries between basal resources and higher trophic levels, and are an essent ial food resource for birds, 1 amphibians, fish and terrestrial insects (Ross and Baker 1983, Batzer and W issinger 1996, Hering and Plachter 1997, O'Connell 2003). Seve ral studies have shown that floodplain invertebrate production can be or ders of m agnitude higher than invertebrate production in the associated channel (Gladden and Smock 1990, Benke 2001), indicating the im portance of floodplain invertebrates to overall ecosystem proce sses. One of the prim ary factors affecting invertebrates in floodplain wetlands is hydroperiod (Gladden and Sm ock 1990, Sm ock 1999, Whiles and Goldowitz 2001). In part, the pattern of flooding and drying in floodplains determ ines the life history and physical adaptati ons of invertebrates that can inhabit them (Gladden and Sm ock 1990, Huryn and Gibbs 1999, Smock 1999, W issinger 1999). Therefore, it is likely that as the character of hydroperiod changes along the grad ient of river discharge in a watershed, the inver tebrate ass emblages will also change. Recently, attem pts to assess the ecolo gical importance of floodplain wetlands have revealed a lack of infor mation on their basic ecology, and have prom pted a call for em pirical studies at the landscape level (Bayley 1995, Johnson and Richardson 1995, W ard and Tockner 2001, Tockner and Stanf ord 2002). The objective of this study was to de scribe invertebrate assem blages in floodplain wetlands of a southeastern U.S. watershed from the headwaters to the lower reach es. Results will help to generate a th eoretical fram ework to explain how lateral flood pulses along a lon gitudin al gradie nt. Furth ermore, since the watershed used for this study was not m anaged for flood control and had natural flood pulses and intact floodplain com plexes, the data gathered wi ll be useful as referen ce data for assessing flood regim es in regulated rivers. 2 METHODS Study Region Study sites were located in stream s and rive r floodplains of the Altam aha watershed of Georgia (Fig.1). The headwaters of the Altam aha River Basin are locat ed in north-central Georgia, and the river's waters flow through the Piedm ont physiograp hic province onto the Atlantic Coastal Plain of south east Georgia. The m ajor rivers in the upper watershed are the Oconee and Oc mulgee Rivers, which converge to for m the Altam aha in the lower reaches. Two large d ams do occur alon g the m ainstem of th e Oconee River. However, these dam s are not managed for flood control, and downstream floods ha ve not been affected by dam s. Therefore, flood pulses are allowed to inunda te downstream floodplain wetlands in a near-natural m anner. The lower Ocm ulgee and the entire A ltamaha flow uni mpounded for a distance of about 480 km . Floodplains of the Altamaha River alone span an area greater than 150 km in length and range between 2 and 10 km in width (TNC and USEPA 2000) . They contain som e of Georgia's last rem aining bottom land hardwood forests and cypr ess swamps. As is typical in southeastern riparian system s, the floodplains associated with this watershed are low-lying and flat (gradient of about 0.2 m km-1) (Mitsch and Gosselink 2000, Sm ock 199 9), and exhibit a strong seasonal hydrology . Although monthly variability in precipitation is sm all (ranging from 6 - 13 cm per month), low evapotranspiration ra tes in winter cause floodplains to become inundated, while higher evapotranspiration rates in the summ er and spring usua lly lim it inundation. In the context of this study we considered standing water on the floodplain to constitu te inundation, even when the floodplain was not completely flooded. 3 Study Sites We located nine sites in backwater swa mps in the Altam aha watershed, beginning in the headwaters of the Oconee River near Athens, GA, and ending near the mouth of the Altam aha River just above the upper extent of tidal influenc e (Fig. 1). S ites were chosen along a gradient of river discharge (Table 1) a nd numbered consecutively, with Site 1 being associated with the lowest river discharge, and Site 9 with the grea test. All sites were loca ted on protec ted natura l areas (county, state or federal preserves, or wildlife m anage ment areas). Rainfall in the central part of Georgia averages around 122 cm per year (NOAA 30 yr data set). A verage river discharg e typically ranges from 35 to 137 m3 s-1 in the Oconee (Sites 5 and 6) and 318 to 386 m3 s-1 in the Altam aha (Sites 7, 8 and 9) (Table 1). Year 1 of our study (2002) was near the end of a 4 year drought, and precipitation was lower than average at 117 cm . River discharge was correspondingly low - about 65 % below average in the Oconee and 68 % below average in the Altam aha (Table 1). The second study year (2003 ) was wetter, with a greater than average annual ra infall of 130 c m. River discharg e was also greater - about 35 % above average in the Oconee and 42 % above average in the Altam aha (Table 1). Sampling Methods Invertebrate Sampling. We focused our sam pling efforts on backswam p habitats (low lying areas b ehind the natu ral levee) becau se these we re the only ar eas tha t reliably re tained water between m ajor flooding events. Once floodplain s becam e inundated, sites were sam pled every 4 - 6 weeks until they dr ied. Sam ples were colle cted only w hen ther e was standing w ater, and therefore no sam ples were taken when floodplains were dry. We sa mpled from January to May of 2002 (Year 1) and from Nove mber 2002 to July 2003 (Year 2). 4 A Hess sampler (860 cm2, 500 \u00b5m mesh, W ildlife Supply Co., Buffalo, NY, U.S.A.) was used to quantitatively sample invertebrates in the benthos and wate r column. W ater and sedim ents were swirled inside th is large corer and forced through the attached collection net. Four sub-samples were collected random ly at each site on each sampling date, and com bined into single com posite samples. These were pr eserved in 95% ethanol, an d return ed to the lab where they were rinsed through standard sieves (1 mm and 0. 3 mm ) and divided into > 1 mm and < 1 mm aliquots. All sam ples were sub-samp led, and invertebrates were rem oved from the debris under a dissecting m icroscope. Invertebra tes were counted, m easured and identified to lowest possible taxon (order, fam ily or ge nus), using keys in Pennak 1989, Peckarsky et al. 1990, Stehr 1991, Thorp and Covich 1991, Eppler 1996, and Merritt and Cumm ins 1996. We measured the lengths of all invertebrates, and used published length-m ass regression models (Benke et al. 1999, Hodar 1996, Sabo et al. 2002) to estim ate biom ass. However, length-m ass regres sion models were not available f or seve ral taxa, and in these c ases we substitu ted a published regression for an inverteb rate with a sim ilar m orphology. Environmental Variables. Water qu ality m easurem ents were collected du ring each in verteb rate sampling visit. W e used hand-held m eters to measure tem perature, pH, town, MD, U.S.A.) to determ ine nitrate and phosphate levels . River discharge for S ites 4 - 9 was obtained from United States Geological Survey wa ter gauge records (www. water.usgs.gov), and Sites 1 - 3 w ere monitored using visu al estimates by study personnel. In addition, floo dplain inundation was recorded and convert ed to percent of sam pling visi ts where inundation occurred per site per year. W e visually determ ined whet her overbank flooding had occurred by assessing water color - water entering floodplains from river channels during floods is colored by 5 suspended clay (rust or chalk colored), while standing water f rom rainfall or groundwater lacks sedim ent staining and is either clear or darkly stained by humic com pounds. Statistical Analyses Environm ental variables were checked for norm ality using the Kol mogorov-Sm irnov test and transform ed where necessary. Patterns of environm ental cha nge across sites (1 - 9) were evaluated using a Spearm an Ranks Correlation test. A Chi -square test was used to detect differences in hydroperiod am ong re aches, by asse ssing the percent of sampling visits with inundation and with overbank flooding. Our m ain objective was to describe patterns of change in invertebra te assemblages alo ng the upstream -downstream gradient. As such, we first pa rtitioned the s ites into groups based upon their sim ilarity of invertebrate distributions, using a hierarch ical, erative analysis with a Sorenson (Bray-Curtis) di stance m easure and a flexible beta group linkage method ( = - 0.25) (McCune and Grace 2002). B oth year s of the study were treated separately in the cluster analyses, and site s were designated by their site num ber followed by a 1 or 2 to indicate study year (e.g. Site 8,2 designated floodplain Site 8 in Y ear 2). We then ran two-way ANOVAs to exam ine total abundance and biom ass in each cluster, and u sed a pairwis e multiple comparison procedure (Tukey Test) to evaluate si gnificant results. To help assess why sites were separating into clus ters, we used a non-m etric m ultidim ensional s caling (NMS) analysis that p roduced axis sco res that were us ed in m ultiple forward regression s of invertebrate m easures against environm ental variables. To characterize clusters, first indi cator sp ecies analys is (Dufrene and Legendre assess which taxa were useful in differen tiating particular clusters. This analysis takes 6 into account the frequen cy and relative abundance of each tax on in pre-d efined groups (in th is case our clu sters) and produces ind icator values for each taxo n ranging from 0 (non-indicato r) to 100 (perfect indicator). Indicat or values were evaluated for statistical significance (p < 0.05) using a Monte Carlo permutation test with 1000 it erations, and only those taxa with significant indicator values were reported. Taxa were consid ered to differentiate clusters for which they had the highest indicator value (see McCune and Gr ace 2002 for detailed description of indicator species analysis). Next we identif ied taxa th at occurred only in a sing le cluster (unique taxa), and finally, we determ ined which ten taxa had the greatest abunda nce and standing stock biom ass in each clus ter. Cluster, NMS and indicator species analyses were com pleted using PC-ORD Version 4.1 (MJM Software Design, Glenden Beach, OR, U. S.A.). ANOVAs, Tuke y Test, Spearm an Rank Correlation and Sigm aPlot 2000 Version 6.0 0 (SPSS, Inc.). Chi square analyses were computed using Microsoft Xcel. For param etric tests, both abundance and biom ass data were log 10 (x+1) transform ed to approxim ate norm al dist ribution. Rare species (those that occurred only once) were not used in analyses (final n = 63). All statistical an alyses were con sidered significant at p < 0.05. 7 RESUL TS Hydrological and physico-chemica l characterization of sites The dries t sites in the wa tershed we re Sites 1 and 2 in the upper reaches (Table 2). Although we never detected significa nt inundation at Site 1, som e sampling visits in the first year occurred imm ediately following m ajor rain events, and we were able to collect sam ples in pools of standing rainwater. Return visits indicated that water persisted for only hours or days. In Year 2, visits to Site 1 did not coincide with ra ins and we never found standing water. In Year 1, Site 2 had significant standing water on the January sample date, but was dry thereafter, and in Year 2, this site was flooded in March but was dr y by April. Neither S ite 1 nor Site 2 was ever inundated by stream water flowing over the bank s, and the lim ited flooding that occurred was from rainfall or groundwater. Sites 3, 4 an d 5 in the m id-reaches of the watersh ed becam e flooded in Novem ber of Year 1, and retained water until J une. In Year 2, these sites firs t flooded in January and retained water until August. Site 3 received overbank flo oding in the second year, but not the first, while Sites 4 and 5 received overbank flooding in both study years. In the lower reaches, Sites 6 and 7 becam e inundated in January of Year 1, but Sites 8 and 9 did not flood until March. All 4 sites were dry by either May or June. In Year 2, Sites 7, 8 and 9 flooded in November, while S ite 6 did no t flood until January. All four sites dried by August. W e did not detect overb ank flow at Site 6 in either year, and rainfall on the floodplain was the only source of inundation. In Year 1, Sites 7, 8 and 9 were inundated only by rainfall and received no overbank flooding; however, in Year 2, all three of these sites were extensively flooded by river water. 8 Hydroperiod differences am ong reaches were significant in term s of both percen t inundation ( 2 = 21.7, df = 4, p < 0.001) and overbank flooding ( 2 = 7.03, df = 2, p < 0.05), with Sites 1 and 2 being drier than expectation and Sites 3, 4 and 5 receiving more overbank flooding than expectation. Spearm an Ranks Correlation an alysis indicated that electrical conductivity (Yr 1: r = 1.00, p < 0.01; Yr 2: r = 0.95, p < 0.01), phosphate levels (Yr 1: r = 0.65, p = 0.05; Yr 2: r = 0.67, p = 0.06) and water tem peratur e (Yr 1: r = 0.84, p < 0.01; Yr 2: r = 0.70, p = 0.05) all increased progressiv ely from the upper to the lo wer reach es of the watershed (Table 2). Neither nitrate nor pH leve ls changed in a predictable fa shion along the floodplain gradient, although nitrate levels were high ly variable (Table 2). Thou gh not significan t, conductivity levels declined from Year 1 to Year 2, presum ably as a resu lt of dilution f rom increase d rainf all. Macroinvertebrate as semblages We collected invertebrates from 90 taxonom ic groups (Appendix). Overall density averaged 113,778 individuals m-2, and standing stock biom ass (dry m ass, DM) averaged 6,188 m g DM m-2. The most taxono mically Cyc lopoida, Chiron omidae, Nem atoda, and Acari w ere the m ost abundant taxa, contribut ing 9, 6, 6, and 5% of the respectively. Dytiscid ae, Chironom idae, Oligochaeta, and As ellidae had th e most standing stock b iomass, contributing 7, 6, 5, and 5%, respectively. Community analyses Cluster analyses of both invertebrate abunda nce and standing stock biom ass separated the 9 sites into 3 groups corresponding to their positions in the w atershed (Figure 2). Sites 1 and 2 9 constituted an upper reach cluster, Sites 3, 4 and 5 constituted a m id-reach cluster, and Sites 7, 8 and 9 constituted a lower reach cluster. There were two anom alies in the g roupings. In the abundance analysis, S ite 8 in Year 2 clustered with the m id-reach sites; and in the b iomass analysis, Site 6 in both years and Site 2 in Year 2 clustered together in their own grouping (Fig. 2). There w as no significant difference in total abundance or biom ass between clusters (Fig. 3). NMS ordinations supported th e results from the cluster analyses in term s of both abundance and standing stock biom ass (Fig. 4). When sites were arrang ed in ord ination space based on co mmunity sim ilarity, the upper, m id- and lower reach clu sters rem ained evident. For the ordination based on abundance, we chose tw o axes that accounted for 92% of variation among sites. The first axis explained 80% of the variation and had a signif icant correlation with degree of inundation (Table 3). This axis sepa rated the drier, upper re ach cluster from the wetter, m id- and lower reach clu sters. The s econd axis, exp laining 12 % of variation, had a significan t correlation with conductivity, and sep arated the lo wer reach cluster, with h igher conductivity, from the upper and m id-reach cl usters, which had lo wer conductivity. In the ordination of invertebrate biom ass, two axes explained 73% of variation am ong sites (Fig. 4). It should be noted that conductivity was correlated with both NMS Axes 1 and 2 (Table 3), suggesting that the conductivity gradient was m oving from low in the bottom left corner of the ordination, to high in the upper right corner (Fig. 4). The first axis in the biom ass ordination accounted for 18% of variation and wa s correlated to nitrate and conductivity (Table 3). This axis separated the upper and undefine d clusters, which had lower conductivity and nitrate levels, from both the m id-reach cluster (with higher conductivity a nd higher nitrate levels) and the lower reach cluster (with higher conductiv ity and lower nitrate levels). The second axis explained 55% of variation a nd was correlated to conductivity and phosphate. It separated the 10 upper reach cluster (with lower c onductivity and phosphate levels) from the lower reach cluster (with high er conductiv ity and phosphate levels). The m id-reach and und efined clusters had interm ediate conductivity and phosphate levels. Characterization of invertebra te assemblages in clusters Upper reach cluster (Sites 1 and 2) . Mean invertebrate abundanc e in the upper reach cluster was 61,552 invertebrates m-2, and average standing stoc k biom ass was 1,682 mg DM m-2. There were no taxa that were significant indicators of this cluster, nor we re there taxa that were unique to this cluster. However, Lum bricidae, Aedes , Harpacticoida and terrestrial Em pididae were numerically dom inant only in th e upper reach cluster (F ig. 5a). The rest of the abundant taxa were also common in the downstream clusters . Cantharidae, Bibi onidae and Em pididae comprised a m ajor portion of the biom ass in th e upper reach cluster only, while the rem aining taxa with high biom ass also had biom ass nstream (Fig. 5b). The anom alous biom ass clustering of Site 2 in Year 2 with Site 6 in both years was m ost likely due to an unusually high biom ass of Culicidae and Ca mbaridae o ccurring in both sites (Fig. 4b). Mid-reach cluster (Sites 3, 4, and 5) . The m id-reach clus ter had a m ean density of 176,633 invertebrates m-2 and a m ean standing stock biom ass of 4,785 m g DM/m-2. Taxa that were indicators of this clus ter in 4). Chironom idae and Elateridae were also indicators of this cluster in term s of biom ass. Several flow-dependent fam ilies were unique to the erically dom inant and Leptophleb iidae, Ephem eridae, and Elateridae dom inated standing stock biom ass only in this cluster (F ig. 5d). Lower reach clusters (Sites 6, 7, 8 and 9) . Invertebrate density in the lower reach cluster averaged 73,393 invertebrates m-2 and average standing stoc k biom ass wa s 8,544 m g DM m-2. Indicators of this cluster were Dytiscid ae and ass only) (Table 4, Fig. 4). Taxa that were unique to th is clus ter included the ter restria l myriapods, Scolopendromorpha Dytiscid beetles were dom inant in term s of abundance and biom ass only in this cluster (Fig. 5e,f), and Planorbidae was dom inant in ter ms of biom ass only in th is clus ter. As m entioned above, Site 6 clustered with Sites 7, 8 and 9 in term s of abundance, but clustered with Site 2 in Year 2 in term s of biom ass, proba bly becaus e of m osquitoes and crayfish. W e are unsure why Site 8 in Year 2 did no t cluster w ith the other lo wer reach s ites in term s of abundance. However, the NMS analyses indicated th at this site bordered the lower reach cluster in ordin ation space. Annual variation In general, collections from Years 1 and 2 fr om Sites 1 through 6 s ub-clustered together, indicating that annual va riation am ong those sites was less im portant than spatial variation (Fig. 2). However, for Sites 7, 8 and 9, collections from Years 1 and 2 did not form sub-clusters, indicating that tem poral factor s were more im portant there. In addition, tw o-way ANOVAs indicated a significant difference in biom ass be tween Years 1 and 2 (Fig. 3, p = 0.021, F = 1, 11) which was prim arily driven by higher biom ass in the upper and lower cl usters during Year 2. 12 DISCUS SION Our hypothesis that floo dplain invertebrate communities wo uld change p redictably along a longitudinal gradient of river discharge was supported by this study. W e found that distinct invertebrate assem blages occurred in the uppe r, middle and lo wer reach es of the Altamaha watershed. However, we had further postulate d that invertebrate comm unities would be prim arily inf luenced by f lood pulse characteristic s which would increase in predictability and duration as they m oved downstream. This study suggests that the true relationship between floodplain inundation, p osition in th e watersh ed and inverteb rates is m ore com plex. We found that floodplains can becom e at least partially inundated even without overbank flow and that habitat flooded only by rainfall or groundwater supported vibrant invert ebrate communities. Further, the predictability of overbank flow did not necess arily increase as pulses m oved downstream. Nevertheless, the idea that the character of fl oodplain invertebrate communities varies greatly throughout watersheds has im portant implications to the ecology and m anagem ent of floodplain habitats. Upper reach floodplains As expected, the floodplains associated with headwater stream s were the driest. The two sites in th e upper re ach were dom inated by terrestrial taxa, su ch ted l fly larvae. These organism s were pr obably able to survive the very short periods of inundation by burrowing into the soil and rem aining relatively inactive until the s ites dried (Sm ock 1999). However, despite the very limited inun dation in these floodplains, two aquatic taxa, Aedes mosquitoes harpacticoid crustaceans, were abundant. 13 Aedes are ch aracterized by rapid life cycles of about 10 days from egg to adult, which m ight enable them to com plete developm ent befo re drying of the floodplain occurs (Horsfall et al. 1975, Sha man et al. 2002). Harpacticoid copepods can also develop rapidly, and have also been found dom inating the floodplain of a Virginia headwater stream that was inundated unpredictably during storm events (Gladde n and Sm ock 1990). The presence of Aedes and harpacticoids is in concordance with Jenkins and Boulton's conclusion about dryland lakes in Australia, th at weak con nectiv ity du ring flooding will result in an aquatic fauna dom inated by drought resistant organism s (Jenkins and Boulton 2003). Mid-rea ch floodplains Contrary to our original hypothe sis, the m id-reaches, rather than the lower reaches, were the m ost predictably inundated. Sites 3, 4 and 5 were inundated on all sampling visits in both years, and overbank flooding occurred at Site 3 in the second year and Sites 4 and 5 in both years. There is som e evidence from Pennsyl vania (Cole and Brooks 2000) that groundwater dominated wetlands in floodplains flood very predictably. In our study, sites in th e mid-reach were all relatively close to the toe-slope and may well have been influenced by groundwater. A combination of overbank flooding and groundwater di scharge m ay explain the predictability and extent of inu ndation in th e mid-reach floodplain compared with the lower reach habitats. The fauna of the m iddle reaches was dom inated by longe r-lived aquatic taxa (a sellids, m ayflies aquatic oligochaetes), although some terrestrial organism s (elaterid beetles and m ites) were still common. We found that fam ilies dependent on wa ter flow, such as riffle beetles an d som e mayflies, were comm on only in these floodplains, which m ight suggest a strong connectivity to the river. Several m ayfly fa milies (C aenidae, Leptophleb iidae and k nown to 14 migrate between lotic and lent ic habitats (Gladden and Smock 1990, Huryn 2002). Mayfly occurrance has been also been linked to the predictability (Huryn 2002) and perm anen ce (Lillie 2003) of floodplain inundation. Low er reach floodplains While flooded less predictably than the m id-reaches, floodplains of the lower reaches were characterized by more extensive and widespread overbank flooding, when flooding occurred. Surprisingly, even during the extens ive overbank f looding of Y ear 2, there was little evidence of riverine invertebra tes com ing into the floodplains. Instead of being dom inated by river-derived invertebrates as in the m id-reaches , the fauna in the lower reaches ost of which persis t in wetlands after they dry. A potentially im portant feature of the lower reach floodplains was the presence of large numbers of Dytiscid ae. These predators com prised a large percentage of overall abundance in the lower reach, and dom inated thes e habitats in term s of biom ass. This was surprising because, in ponds and lakes, the presence of fish has been shown to preclude the presence of large-bodied, active invertebrate predators, such as dytiscids (B ennett and Stream s 1986, Blois-Heulin et al 1990, W ellborn et al. 1996, Corti et al. 1997). During the extensive overbank flooding in the second year of the study, it is lik ely that fish were present in the floodplain at the same tim e we collected large num bers of dytiscid beetles. However, fish ente ring floodplains in the southeastern US are usually small (larval form s, dim inutive taxa) (Ross and Baker 1983, O'Connell 2003), and may not consum e the beetles (Corti et al. 1997). Alternatively, the increased turbidity during overbank flooding m ay protect beetles from predation. However, it 15 seem s likely that both fish and invertebrate pred ation a re importan lower reach Environmental on invertebrate dis tribution Based on multip le regressions be tween NMS axes and our en vironm ental variab les, higher conductivity seem ed to be associated wi th higher invertebrate biom ass and abundance in the lower reaches of the waters hed. In rivers, this variable has been positively linked to increased urbanization (Om eto et al. 2000) and negatively linked to m acroinvertebrate biotic integ rity (Roy et al. 2003). However, a link between ur banization and invertebrates seem s unlikely in floodplains o f the Altam aha because land-use in the lower reaches tends towards lumber and agricu lture, while urban ization is more comm on in the upper reaches. The progressive downstream increase in conductivity m ay sim ply reflect an overall increase in water- borne m aterials (organic and inorganic sedim ents, nutrients) and this change m ay affect invertebrates. This m ay partly explain the la rger annual variation in invertebrate com munity structure in the lower reaches, since floodplains were inundated by ra inwater in the first year, but by overbank flow in the second year. Implica tions The im portance of floodplain habitats is now wi dely accepted. However, inform ation is still lacking on their basic ecol ogy. Although floodplain invertebrate s are an im portant part of riverine ecosystem s, very little is known about their comm unity st ructure or their contribution to ecological processes. This study was am ong the first to describe a pattern of change in floodplain inverteb rate communities at a waters hed level. Our study ind icates that th e character 16 of invertebrate comm unity structure vari es greatly am ong floodplains, with headwater floodplains being inated by rapidly-developing invertebrates, by an influ x of inve rtebrates from the river, and with the lower reaches bein g dom inated by wetland taxa with d esiccation res istant stages. Water reso urce policy m akers should take this variability in to account when determ ining flood regim es in regulated rivers, and should prescribe flooding th at mimics the natural character for a given watershed position. 17 LITERATURE CITED Bayely, P.B. 1995.
