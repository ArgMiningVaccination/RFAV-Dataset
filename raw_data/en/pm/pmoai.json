Contrary to false information that seems to be the foundation of these mandates, the currently available COVID-19 Shots have not received FDA approval and remain under an emergency use authorization (Comirnaty is currently not available). Also, the mRNA COVID-19 shots do not prevent infection, nor do they prevent transmission. The federal government has granted companies like Pfizer and Moderna immunity from liability if something unintentionally goes wrong with their vaccines. In February, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar invoked the Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act. The 2005 law empowers the HHS secretary to provide legal protection to companies making or distributing critical medical supplies, such as vaccines, unless there's willful misconduct by the company. The protection lasts until 2024. So for next several years, these companies cannot be sued for money damages in court over injuries related to the administration or use of products to treat or protect against Covid. It is preposterous to mandate an experimental shot, which it is proving to be an ineffective, to someone not wishing to comply. If said person has an adverse reaction there is no liable entity. The vaccine injured are responsible for all medical expenses associated with a vaccine injury whether they wanted the vaccine or not. It is also startling that natural immunity is not even being considered. It seems science is being ignored in favor of Big Pharma profits. There are more than 145 current Peer-Reviewed and published research studies that demonstrate that Natural Immunity to infection from Sars-Cov-2 is far superior and much longer lasting than each of the current Emergency Use Authorized ONLY (Not FDA Approved) Covid-19 shots. Links to all 91 studies are easily found at this link at Brownstone Institute. Science should not be ignored when making decisions to inject or provide experimental drug therapies that have NOT been proven safe or effective. When it comes to children and citizens I ask you please consider the overwhelming science showing superiority to natural immunity over artificial immunity of all COVID 19 shots: https://brownstone.org/?s=natural+immunity+to+Covid A report on the CDC website dated 8/18/2021 shows actual heart damage and inflammation caused by COVID19 shots within one week of 2nd shot occurred 5-20 times more often than the CDC expected, for all age groups. The risk of heart damage called Myocarditis is proven to be higher from the effects of injury from the Pfizer Covid Shots than heart disease created by an actual COVID-19 infection. Myocarditis is listed as known side effects on the FDA created FACT SHEETS for the Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines. You can find these fact sheets at FDA.gov. Myocarditis alone is normally extremely rare in children and teens. The data shown on the CDC website reporting Myocarditis events in teens and adults after receiving 2nd Pfizer COVID-19 vaccines, should be adequate information to stop government over reach to mandate any Covid vaccines. The FDA data discussed is early data, occurring within days or weeks of vaccination. We do not know what adverse effects these vaccines will have long term, as long term safety studies have yet to take place. This is the first time any mRNA vaccines has been introduced into the human body and once injected cannot be removed . To force the citizens of Maine to participate in an experiment that could result in unknown health consequences in the future is unconscionable. Please protect and preserve the rights of all citizens to make their own decisions regarding Covid vaccination. Informed consent is not possible without long-term safety studies. Informed consent is paramount and both an ethical and LEGAL requirement for any medical procedure including vaccination. There can be no mandate where informed consent is required. "}
