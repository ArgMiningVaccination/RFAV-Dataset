Watch the conference video [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4F80YRUR8cGgznOs4UJLDOb2m97Xl4cZ). Slides from each presenter are linked below under each presentation's summary. The COVID-19 pandemic. Systemic oppression. Political upheaval. Human rights abuses. Increased mental health need. Climate impacts. Collective trauma. These are just a few of many national and global crises facing our world today, which have taken a unique existential toll on psychotherapists and spiritual care providers who are on the frontlines of offering support. When we as caregivers face burnout, compassion fatigue, and personal losses, it can be incredibly challenging to continue to be emotionally present, responsive, and effective in our professional roles. This free online conference (October 28th, 9am - 4pm EDT), supported by a grant from the Peale Foundation, brings together leaders in mental health and spiritual care to: - Identify the psychological, emotional, relational, and existential impacts of companioning others amidst suffering - Explore personal capacities and contextual factors that can help caregivers metabolize these impacts and thrive in their work - Discover systemic pathways to resilience, justice, and holistic well-being Continuing Education (CE) Credits: - 5.5 credit hours for Psychologists - 5.5 credit hours for Social Workers - 5.5 credit hours for Marriage and Family Therapists The Danielsen Institute is approved by the American Psychological Association to sponsor continuing education for psychologists.

Racial injustice and trauma have significant impact on a sense of identity and well-being. This presentation will focus on the impact of racial trauma as well as on strategies within and outside of the mental health professions that can promote individual and collective healing and empowerment. Specifically, I will explore how to address racial injustice and trauma through conducting culturally informed research and psychotherapy, engaging with communities to raise awareness regarding traumatic stress and mental health issues shaped by injustice, and helping communities to mobilize their strengths that facilitate healing and foster meaning-making and hope. In order to illustrate these approaches, the presenter will draw on recent research with Indian Americans and involvement with mental health education within Hindu communities in the United States. Learning Objectives Participants will: - Identify how racism and racial trauma impact individuals and communities. - Describe how mental health professionals and spiritual leaders can collaborate to provide meaningful resources to individuals coping with racial trauma and other forms of injustice. - Examine the complexities of collaborating with communities whose approach to trauma and mental health may differ from that of mental health professions.

Click here for a link to the presentation slides: Existential Overwhelm and the Value of Nurturing Questions over Time: Implications for Metabolizing Vicarious Trauma and Moral Distress to Promote Resilience Shelly Rambo, Ph.D. School of Theology Boston University Abstract: What does it mean to be not just physically, but also existentially overwhelmed and fatigued? Many helping professionals report this phenomenon in the face of overwhelming stressors, losses, and caregiving needs of the last several years, and a growing body of literature explores compassion fatigue, vicarious trauma, moral injury, and burnout as potential occupational hazards. This presentation suggests that existential inquiry\u2014nurturing big questions over time\u2014may be vital to countering these risks. Drawing from existential, philosophical, and spiritual perspectives, the presenter will explore these topics in conversation with one of Rev. Howard Thurman's persisting questions\u2014how does the human spirit accommodate itself to desolation? Thurman's pursuit of this question over decades of his life served not only as a source of personal consolation, but also a means of fostering collective healing. Moving beyond individualistic and productivity focused frameworks for provider well-being, this presentation will explore the relevance of existential perspectives in promoting adaptive meaning-making and resilience. Learning Objectives Participants will: - Identify and describe the unique personal impacts of their caregiving work on their experience of self, others, the world, and the sacred. - Critically reflect on the role of existential inquiry as potentially vitalizing and sustaining to their work as helping professionals. - Explore the contributions of spiritual and philosophical traditions as part of cultural competence and holistic provision of care.

Therapist burnout is a significant predictor of client outcomes and therapists' retention in the field. In this presentation, the salient literature on therapist character strengths that are associated with preventing burnout and promoting therapist flourishing will be provided. We will have an engaging, experiential session for therapists to deeply engage the material. Learning Objectives Participants will: - Identify three ways in which therapist burnout manifests within their practice. - Develop strategies to promote character strengths to avoid burnout and promote flourishing. - Examine relational strategies that fit with their context and needs in order to support ongoing professional development.

Click here for a link to the presentation slides: Cultivating Cultural Fortitude: Acts of Interpersonal Courage in Times of Uncertainty Karen Tao, Ph.D. Department of Educational Psychology The University of Utah Abstract: Patient-provider interactions and healthcare workplace dynamics are often influenced by individuals' cultural frames of reference (e.g., religion, race, sexuality, social class), involving intricate negotiations between what we say and how it is received. Inevitably, there are moments where intention and impact do not align, and result in interpersonal ruptures (e.g., microaggressions; racism). In the current sociopolitical climate, these ruptures create seemingly irreparable rifts, which compounded by an overburdened healthcare system, increases psychological and physical stress for providers and staff. Our individual responses to these interactions often include minimizing the critical incident, publicly calling out a person or their behavior, or cutting off relationships. In this presentation, we consider a different approach by using a tool based on the concept of Calling In. Calling In (visit the work of: Loretta Ross & Ngoc Loan Tran) refers to a compassionate stance we can take when experiencing or witnessing a cultural rupture within our communities. It involves a balance of humility and cultural fortitude. Cultural Fortitude is broadly defined as cognitive, emotional, physiological, and relational strength in the face of psychological discomfort, which can spark motivation and courage to move toward interpersonal repair and healing. This presentation will consider how concepts from Calling In and Cultural Fortitude may open possibilities for healing communities to foster deeper connections, take care of each other, and to flourish. Learning Objectives Participants will: - Identify the three roles within a Calling In situation (e.g., witness, deliverer, receiver). - Recognize how the concept of Cultural Fortitude can be utilized within interpersonal rupture-repair situations. - Identify at least one situation the concept of Calling In and Cultural Fortitude can be applied within their own healing community.

Wang, Ph.D. School of Psychology and Marriage and Family Therapy Fuller Seminary Abstract: This presentation will explore the contributions of psychology and religion/spirituality towards a more nuanced understanding of the relationship between human and spiritual flourishing. Theoretical and empirical literature on the spiritual and holistic flourishing of current and future religious leaders will be reviewed and provide a context for a presentation of recent findings from a John Templeton Foundation funded 3-year longitudinal program of research involving over 1,500 individuals affiliated with 18 Roman Catholic, Mainline Protestant, Evangelical, Historically African American, Episcopal, and Orthodox seminaries. Drawing from analysis of data collected both before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, the presenter will draw out practical and empirically-informed pathways towards holistic well-being\u2014even within contexts of mass trauma and prolonged challenge and distress. Learning Objectives Participants will: - Identify at least three empirically informed predictors and correlates of spiritual and human flourishing. - Describe at least three empirically informed predictors of burnout during the COVID-19 pandemic. - Critically reflect on at least two ways in which spiritual well-being, character/virtue, and mental/emotional well-being Martoni, M., Russo, V., & Colombo, L.

Click here for a link to the presentation slides: Seeking Well-Being in Territories of Despair: Relational Strengths for Practitioner Formation Steven J. Sandage, Ph.D., LP The Albert & Jessie Danielsen Institute Boston University Abstract: This presentation will utilize the relational spirituality model (RSM; Sandage, Rupert, et al., 2020) to interpret empirical research on risks for burnout and trauma and pathways toward well-being for therapists and spiritual care providers. The relational development emphasis of the RSM will serve to frame key individual, interpersonal, organizational, and wider sociocultural diversity factors that form potential risks and resources for helping professionals in the current United States context. The challenges to relational ecologies of care provision often include multi-dimensional existential anxieties activated by suffering and trauma exposure, systemic forms of injustice, and ambiguities for seeking formation-based training and professional growth. Relational strengths for practitioner formation in professional communities will be highlighted along with strategies for countering three common risk dynamics (i.e., over-functioning, reactivity to conflict and difference, hiding the self) that impede holistic well-being. Learning Objectives Participants will: - Describe three key evidence-based risk dynamics for burnout and trauma among helping professionals. - Identify four relational strengths of individuals and organizations that can promote well-being among helping professionals. - Analyze well-being risk and resource factors based on key tenets of the relational spirituality model.
