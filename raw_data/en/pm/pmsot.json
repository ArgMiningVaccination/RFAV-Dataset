Cancer survivors and those afflicted with terminal disease rely on rehabilitation to optimize quality of life and maintain dignity. Rehabilitation takes a holistic approach integrating multiple key concepts. First, an approach that is \"patient-centered\"\u2014 tailored to the patient's individualized situation, needs, and wants. The patient (and their family) is the leader of the team and carefully honors the patient's wishes. Communication is key to ensuring that the healthcare team is up-to-date with a patient's goals and the potential evolution of those goals across the cancer continuum. Second, a \"goal-oriented\" technique should be used for rehabilitation. Goals should be measurable, achievable, concrete, and typically focus on function and/or quality of life (QOL), thus allowing communication between the patient, caregiver, and the healthcare team. Hope should be maintained when discussing goals; however, it is also important to be realistic and discuss alternatives that maintain dignity. Third, rehabilitation that employs an \"interdisciplinary team approach.\" Common goals are paramount. Unlike tradiAnnals tional multidisciplinary teams, which strive to achieve specialty-oriented tasks, interdisciplinary team members work together to meet the patient's goals as well as the objectives for their individual disciplines. Group communication, creativity, and humility are compulsory characteristics of team members needed to achieve these goals. Fourth, in most cases, \"active participation of the patient\" is necessary for rehabilitation. At times, the family may learn how to safely care for their loved one at the end of their life. However, during the majority of the cancer continuum, rehabilitation requires active engagement of the patient and family to partake in education, therapy, and display carry-over of newly acquired skills. There is a partnership between the healthcare team and patient; the patient takes on the onus of self-management. [2](#b2-arm-22036)]. Definitions are listed in [Fig. 1](#f1-arm-22036), which illustrates the integral role of rehabilitation in optimizing QOL. This review will analyze impairments, activity restrictions, and participation limitations in cancer patients and reveal the benefits of rehabilitation in mitigating disabilities. EPIDEMIOLOGY OF CANCER DISABILITY [3](#b3-arm-22036), [4](#b4-arm-22036)]. Thus, patients live longer with more years of cancer-related disability. In 2020, cancer caused 208.3 disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), as estimated by the Global Burden of Disease Cancer [ [5](#b5-arm-22036)]. Impaired activities of daily living (ADLs) and mobility, as well as higher self-reported pain scores, were noted in cancer survivors over 55 years old compared with controls [ [6](#b6-arm-22036)]. Improving survival rate is insufficient without also optimizing QOL for cancer survivors. Patients with lymphedema may have an impaired QOL. Approximately 200 million people are affected by lymphedema worldwide [ [7](#b7-arm-22036)]. WHICH PATIENTS SHOULD BE REFERRED FOR CANCER REHABILITATION AND WHEN? [Table 1](#t1-arm-22036)). As early as possible, clinicians should ask, \"Has your function changed?\" Given the complexity of cancer and chronic illness, a preventive and comprehensive strategy for disability and illness should be employed. Throughout the continuum of cancer, survivors are concerned about fatigue, overall health, pain, fitness, and social and emotional functioning [ [8](#b8-arm-22036)]. Early in the disease, anxiety may be the most concerning symptom that is typically accompanied by the disruption of routines. Patients with cancer in the treatment phase, additional impairments, including nausea, fatigue, and sleep disturbances, may arise. Referral to cancer rehabilitation should occur if there is pain, fatigue, impaired ADLs and/or mobility. Additional guidelines that indicate site-specific referral recommendations have been published [ [9](#b9-arm-22036)]. [10](#b10-arm-22036)]. Research has shown that education and exercise before treatment can reduce morbidity and decrease length of hospital stay [ [11](#b11-arm-22036)]. In patients with vestibular schwannomas, preoperative vestibular training improves Patients with the poorest endurance/lowest anaerobic threshold benefit the most from preoperative rehabilitation [ [13](#b13-arm-22036)]. [14](#b14-arm-22036)]. IMPAIRMENTS Pain [15](#b15-arm-22036)]. Function is intimately correlated with the severity of pain, and this was demonstrated in 216 patients with metastatic cancer [ [16](#b16-arm-22036)]. Fatigue [17](#b17-arm-22036)]. Exercise can reduce cancer-related fatigue [ [18](#b18-arm-22036)]. Emotions and social and economic status can have negative impact on fatigue [ [19](#b19-arm-22036)]. Cancer-related fatigue can be reduced by optimizing sleep quality; however, increasing \"rest\" is not helpful [ [20](#b20-arm-22036)]. Cognitive impairment and delirium [21](#b21-arm-22036)]. About 50% of the time, delirium may be reversible and due to manageable and identifiable causes [ [22](#b22-arm-22036)]. Appropriate diagnosis is needed to determine the appropriate treatment, and there are numerous causes of delirium in patients with cancer. Research on bone marrow transplant patients has demonstrated risk factors in pre-transplant patients with higher blood urea nitrogen, magnesium, and alkaline phosphatase levels, and lower cognitive/physical function [ [23](#b23-arm-22036)]. [23](#b23-arm-22036)]. The clinician must also consider metabolic factors. Fever and sepsis often cause acute delirium, and dehydration and uremia frequently contribute to this condition. Hypoxia and hypoglycemia are additional factors that can be easily assessed. [24](#b24-arm-22036)]. Many of these reports on cognitive difficulty may be related to fatigue. Mood disorders [25](#b25-arm-22036)]. Anxiety is common and may be related to poorly controlled pain, abnormal metabolic states, or medication-related adverse effects. Patients may also experience post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in response to cancer diagnosis and treatment. PTSD is an anxiety disorder that develops after an extremely stressful event, such as life-threatening illness. Within 5 years of diagnosis, between 10% and 15% of cancer survivors may meet the PTSD [ [26](#b26-arm-22036)]. Neurologic impairments Hemiplegia [27](#b27-arm-22036)]. [28](#b28-arm-22036)]. Rehabilitation efforts focus on the patient's neurological and functional status, coexisting medical problems, and tolerance of physical activity. For patients who have had a stroke or traumatic brain injury, goal setting should be appropriate to the individual's physical, cognitive, and behavioral status and should include early planning for post-acute rehabilitation care. Paraplegia and tetraplegia [29](#b29-arm-22036)]. Spinal cord metastases produce a clinical syndrome characterized initially by pain in 90% of cases, followed by weakness, sensory loss, and sphincter dysfunction. Weakness is present in 74% to 76% of patients, autonomic dysfunction is present in 52% to 57% of patients, and sensory loss is present in 51% to 53% of patients [ [30](#b30-arm-22036)]. Speech/swallowing/nutrition [31](#b31-arm-22036)]. Bone tumors and amputations [32](#b32-arm-22036)]. If a patient is deemed at risk of a pathological fracture, they should not bear weight on the affected structure, pending an orthopedic consultation. [33](#b33-arm-22036)]. Soft tissue impairments associated with cancer diagnoses [34](#b34-arm-22036)]. The use of manual lymph drainage and compression garments is effective in controlling edema. When applied early in the course of treatment, before the development of a significant volume increase (e.g., >250 mL increase in the arm), lymphedema can be reversed [ [35](#b35-arm-22036)]. Traditionally, patients with lymphedema have been told not to lift weights. However, new data show that not only does weightlifting not worsen lymphedema, but it may also be beneficial [ [36](#b36-arm-22036)]. [37](#b37-arm-22036)]. This process is associated with vascular permeability, inflammation, and the release of proinflammatory cytokines (e.g., interleukins and transforming growth factor-), and continues well past cessation of radiation therapy. Physical therapy is particularly important for maintaining range of motion. Splinting may also be helpful in certain cases. The use of antifibrotic agents for the treatment of this condition has shown promise [ [38](#b38-arm-22036)]. [39](#b39-arm-22036)]. Bladder and bowel management Sexual function [40](#b40-arm-22036)]. Erectile dysfunction is a common adverse effect of prostatectomy, hormonal therapy, and radiation therapy in prostate cancer patients. Surgery for colorectal cancer often leads to sexual dysfunction in men, and gynecological cancers often produce changes in vaginal sensation, structure, and lubrication. However, 63.5% of patients with cancer who received brief sexual counseling reported improvement [ [41](#b41-arm-22036)]. ACTIVITY LIMITATIONS Activities of daily living [42](#b42-arm-22036)]. In patients with advanced-stage cancer, the percentage of caregivers with a high level of psychological distress varied from 41% to 62%, directly depending on the functional status of the patient [ [43](#b43-arm-22036)]. [Fig. 2](#f2-arm-22036)) can help patients perform everyday tasks. To improve feeding independence among patients with cancer who have upper limb neurologic dysfunction, Chinese researchers used positioning, feeding aid support, and upper limb support, and significantly improved function during a 3-week treatment intervention [ [44](#b44-arm-22036)]. Homebased occupational therapy interventions produce a high level of patient and caregiver satisfaction, thereby reducing the burden of care. Exercise for patients with cancer [45](#b45-arm-22036)]. Meta-analyses [ [46](#b46-arm-22036)] suggests that for adults with a variety of cancer diagnoses and who are receiving a variety of exercise interventions, exercise improves physical function, QOL, and cardiorespiratory fitness, and decreases cancer-related fatigue [ [47](#b47-arm-22036)- [49](#b49-arm-22036)]. The majority of these studies employed aerobic exercise, ergometry and walking programs, and occasionally, aquatic therapies. [Table 2](#t2-arm-22036)outlines the contraindications for exercise. Physical modalities Durable medical equipment PARTICIPATION RESTRICTIONS Family and social relationships [50](#b50-arm-22036)]. In one study of 121 patients with cancer, caregiver QOL was significantly correlated with the social/family and functional dimensions of patients' QOL; physical and emotional dimensions did not correlate [ [51](#b51-arm-22036)]. Cancer also can place a significant economic burden on families. Cost considerations play a large role in patient decision-making regarding cancer treatment, especially among the poor. Vocational rehabilitation [52](#b52-arm-22036)] conducted phone interviews with 1,433 cancer survivors 1 to 5 years after diagnosis. More than half quit work during the first year after cancer diagnosis, but three-quarters of those subsequently returned to work. A projected 13% had indefinite work disability. Survivors of central nervous system, head and neck, and stage IV blood and lymph malignancies had the highest risk of quitting work. [53](#b53-arm-22036)] studied 235 cancer survivors in the Netherlands and found that fatigue levels strongly predicted inability to return to work. Participation in recreation [54](#b54-arm-22036)]. Significant improvements in self-esteem, selfefficacy, and anxiety were observed. Adults benefit as well. For example, 11 small studies have shown that Tai Chi Chuan, an Asian mind-body practice, has beneficial effects in cancer survivors [ [55](#b55-arm-22036)]. Transportation [56](#b56-arm-22036)] showed that patients receiving chronic, stable opioid analgesic therapy could drive safely. Patients with cerebral dysfunction resulting from a tumor, paraneoplastic effects, or treatment adverse effects should be evaluated for their ability to drive safely before they are allowed to return to the road. Welldefined off-road driver evaluation tools are available. ONCOLOGIC "}
