Email: tdesilva@mrc.gm Word count: 5000 Abstract The burden of influenza in Africa is significant and under -appreciated. While surveillance has increased , our understanding of seasonal influenza vaccine performance remains limited . We conducted a systematic review, using PRISMA guidelines (PROSPERO CRD42017058107 ), on the efficacy, effectiveness and immunogenicity of influenza v accines in populations within Africa with the aim of identif ying key data gaps to help direct future research. We searched Embase, Medline, Global Health and Web of Science for published studies fro m database inception to May 9th, 2018 . Unpublished studies were identified by searching Clinical Trials.go v and the Pan-African Clinical Trial Registry and by contact ing experts with in the field. Human studies which reported influenza vaccine immunogenicity, effectiveness and effica cy were included. The quality of each study was assessed using the GRADE framework. 1746 articles were assessed and 2 3 articles included : six maternal immuni sation , 6 child immunisati on, three elderly immunisation and 8 other articles. Only three studies were of high quality and many studies were under -powered . All studies came from only six African countries (16 from South Africa), highlighting the need for data from a broader range of African populations. The majority of studies focused on effectiveness or efficacy against laboratory confirmed in fluenza with limited data on severe outcomes. Several factors known to interfere with influenza immunization, such as malaria, HIV and malnutrition were under -represented in this review and require further study. Signi ficant gaps exist in our understan ding of influenza vaccine performance across all WHO h igh risk groups in Africa . Introduction The impact of influenza on African populations and health systems is under -appreciated. Influenza cause s approximately 300,000 -650,000 deaths per year with the highest mortality rates seen in sub-Saharan Africa .1 The per capita influenza -associated hospitalisation rate in children <5 years is estimated to be 174 per 100,000 /year in Africa compared to 53 per 100,000/ year in Europe .2 Influenza surveillance in 15 African cou ntries (2006 - 2010 ) showed the overall proportion of influenza positivity was 21 \u00b77% in influenza -like illness (ILI) cases and 10 \u00b71% in severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) .3 A combination of poor nutrition and socioeconomic conditio ns, higher prevalence of co-infections (E.g. HIV, tuberculosis , Streptococcus pneumoniae ) and limited access to healthcare , may contribute to seasonal influenza infections play ing a greater role in respiratory disease -related morbidity and mortality in Africa than in high income countries (HIC) .4 In 2012, the WHO Stra tegic Advisory Group of Experts recommended influenza vaccination programmes focusing on key high -risk groups :5 pregnant women, children aged 6-59 months, individuals with specific chronic illnesses, the e lderly a nd health care workers. Despite the se recommendations , by 2014, only three African countries (of 47 WHO member states) had seasonal influenza vaccine policies : South Africa, Algeria and Morrocco .6 While the reasons for this are multifactorial (including health economic) , there is a lack of knowledge regarding influenza vaccine performance in African population s and no systematic review has been pu blished. Previous examples such as rotavirus and oral polio vaccines sho w that efficacy and immunogenicity data from HIC are no t always transferrable to low and middle -income countries ( LMICs).7 Several factors such as year -round transmission of influenza within the tropics ,8 high HIV prevalence and reduced maternal antibody transfer with malaria infection9 could influence vaccine performance . We have carried out a systematic review of the current literat ure to identify key data gaps in the efficacy, effectiveness and immunogenicity of influenza vaccine s in African populations and help shape future research priorities. Methods The study was conducted using PRISMA guidelines and registered with PROSPERO (CRD42017058107). Search strategy and selection criteria Published articles were identified by searching Emba se, Medline, Global health and Web of Science using the following strategy: (influenza OR flu) AND (vaccin* O R immuni#ation OR Influenza Vaccines [Subject heading]) AND OR effect* OR immune* OR OR protect*) AND (Africa OR Africa [Subject heading] OR each African countr y [defined by United Nations]). A full list of included countries is shown in the Appendix. Databases were first se arch on the 17th of January 2017 and an updated search carried out on the 9th of May 2018. Unpublished trials were identified by searching Clinicaltrials.gov and the Pan -African Clinical Trial Registry. Experts within the field were contacted. References within identified studies were reviewed fo r additional articles . All studies which assessed influenza vaccine efficacy , effectiveness or immunogenicity (definitions below) in populations within African countries , were included. No studies were excluded based on year , language or quality . Purely descriptive obs ervational studies were excluded, as were animal immunogenicity studies . Definitions , data extraction and quality assessment Vaccine efficacy is defined as a relative reduction in influenza risk after vaccinat ion determined by a randomi sed controlled trial (RCT) . Effectiveness denotes a relative reduction in odds of influenza associated with vaccination in an observational study. Immunogenicity is used to mean the immune response to influenza vaccination. Two authors (BL and EPA) carried out the follow ing methods independently. Titles and abstracts were screened for relevance. Ful l articles were reviewed against inclusion and exclusion criteria. Data from inclu ded trials were extracted: population, design/methodology, participant numbers, type of vaccine , and key findings (vaccine efficacy /effectiveness with confidence intervals and/or haemagglutination inhibition titres ). Data were inputed into a table created in Microsoft Word. Vaccine efficacy or effectiveness studies were group ed and evaluated as per WHO high risk groups .5 Immunogenicity outcomes were summarised together. The limitations and quality of each study w ere assessed using the GRADE framework10 and used to identify populations lacking high quality studies. Discrepancies with data extraction and quality assessment were settled by discussion and co nsensus. A meta -analysis would be carried out if greater than two studies from the same WHO high risk group5 were identified which shared similar populations, interventions, comparison a nd outcomes. Result s Study selection and characteristics Titles and abstracts of 1746 published articles were screened (Figure 1) and 68 full-text articles were assessed for eligibility. Of these, studies were excluded due to a lack of efficacy, effectiveness or immunogenicity data (23), presence of duplicate data (18), data from a non -African countr y (1) and lack of influenza vaccine usage (3). 23 studies were included (Supplementary table 1) .11-33 Studies varied by study design , vaccine type (inactivated influenza vaccine, IIV3; live attenuated influenza vaccine, LAIV) and study population (Table 1). 16 were from South Africa ,11-14,16 -19,23,25,27 - 32 two each from Gabon21,22 and Kenya,20,26 and one study each from Mal i15,33 Senegal24 and The Gambia .33 The following study populations were identified: pregnan t women ( 6 studies ), children (6), elderly (3) , HIV-Positive adults (1), healthcare worker s (1) and all age groups (6). Study design included RCTs (12 studies), case -control studies (6), and cohort studies (1). Vaccines used included IIV3 ( 17 studies ), LAIV (3), both and a monovalent inactivated pandemic H1N1 vaccine (1) . Articles were evaluated in detail after grouping by WHO high -risk population .5 A summary of vaccine efficacy and effectiveness from each study is shown in figure 2. A meta - analysis was deemed unsuitable due to the low number of studies sharing a similar population, intervention , comparison and outcome . Influenza vaccination in pregnant women One RCT from South Africa11 and one from Mali15 evaluated influenza vaccination in pregnant women , with three studies reporting secondary analyses fr om the South Africa RCT12-14 and one study reporting a secondary analysis from both RCTs (Supplementary table 1 ).31 A single centre , randomised, double -blind placebo -controlled trial including -infected pregnant w omen (60% on HAART at enrolment, median CD4 count 393 \u00b75 cells/mm3) was conducted in South Africa .11 The influenza attack rate in HIV -infected placebo recipients was higher than in HIV -uninfected placebo recipients (17 \u00b70% vs to 3 \u00b75%). The per-protocol vacci ne efficacy against all reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT -PCR) -confirmed symptomatic influenza was 54.4% (95% CI 19 88\u00b78, P=0\u00b702) for HIV -infected women. Infants born to HIV -uninfected women had a per - protocol vaccine efficacy against RT-PCR-confirmed symptomatic infection of 45 \u00b76% (95% CI 2\u00b74, 69\u00b77, P = 0 \u00b704) at six months of age compared to 42\u00b73% (95% CI -96\u00b79, 83 \u00b71, P=0\u00b752) in HIV -exposed - uninfected infants . No impact of vaccination on birthweight, clinical febrile illness or ILI was seen , although the study was not powered for these outcomes. An extended follow up study12 of the HIV -uninfected women failed to show statistically significan t protective efficacy against RT-PCR-confirmed symptomatic influenza during the following season . No power calculation for vaccine efficacy in the extended period was reported , which included only a subset of participants . A secondary analysis of the HIV -unexposed infants showed that vaccine efficacy against RT-PCR-confirmed symptomatic influenza was 53\u00b79% (95% CI 10 \u00b74, 77\u00b74, P=0\u00b702) at 16 weeks of age, with no statistically s ignificant protection at > 16-24 weeks .13 A furthe r analysis of the HIV -unexposed infants demonstrated that maternal immunisation reduced hospitalisation for all -cause acute lower respiratory ( 95% CI 7 \u00b70, 81\u00b70, P=0\u00b7032) during the first 90 days of life .14 The vaccine efficacy against severe infant pne umonia over the first 180 days of life was 43% (95% CI 0 , 67, p=0 \u00b705).31 Results from a multi centre, active -controlled, observer -blind RCT in HIV -uninfected pregnant women conducted in Mali15 showed similar results . The vaccine efficacy against all RT-PCR- confirmed symptomatic influenza was 76 \u00b76% (95% CI 28 \u00b74, 94\u00b78) for women during pregnancy 70\u00b71% (95% CI \u00b70, 89\u00b71) in the six-month post -partum period . Cumulative per-protocol vaccine efficacy against all RT -PCR-confirmed symptomatic influenza in infants was 70\u00b72% (95% CI 11 \u00b73, 91\u00b71) during the first four , decreasing to 37 \u00b73% (95% CI 7\u00b76, 57\u00b78) by six months of age. No difference was seen in the birthweights between vaccine groups , although the study was not powered for this outcome . A secon dary analysis of this trial reported a vaccine efficacy against all- cause severe infant pneumonia in the first 180 days of life of -17% (95% CI -67, 19, P=0.39) .31 Influenza vaccination in children Four studies were identified which reported vaccine efficacy (3) or effectiveness (1) of influenza vaccination in children (Supplementary table 1 ).19,20,23,24 A multicentre , double -blind , placebo - controlled RCT in healthy children aged 6 to <36 months from South Africa, Brazil , and Argentina23 investigated the efficacy of LAIV (Ann -Arbor backbone , Medimmune ). Data from the South African participants (n=277) was obtained via personal communication wi th authors of a meta -analysis analysing country -stratified data (Chris topher Ambrose, personal communication).34 This data generated an efficacy estimate for two LAIV doses of 87% (95% CI 64, 95) for prevention of culture - confirmed symptomatic influenza in South Africa . There are no country -stratified demographic data available on factors such as nutritional statu s or ethnicity, which may be important to assess the generalisability of these findings to other African populations . The e fficacy of one dose of Russian -backbone LAIV (Nasovac -S\u00ae, Serum Institute of India P vt Ltd ) among healthy children in Senegal aged 2 to 5 years was reported recently .24 This single centre, randomised, double -blind, placebo -controlled study was designed assuming a 6% influenza incidence. Per-protocol vaccine efficacy was 0.0% (95% CI -26\u00b74, 20\u00b79) influenza strains CI 25.0) for all vaccine -matched were pdm09H1N1) against RT- PCR-confirmed symptomatic influenza . The overall attack rate was 18% and vaccine -matched strain attack rate 8-9%. Most vaccine -unmatched isolates were influenza B ( Victoria lineage ) viruses. The absence of immuno genicity measurements to investigate the lack of efficacy observed was a major limitation of this study. Madhi et al. (2013)19 conduc ted a randomised, double -blind trial comparing two doses of IIV3 with placebo in HIV -infected children aged 6 to 59 months in South Africa. The per -protocol vaccine efficacy (culture and/or RT -PCR-confirmed symptomatic influenza ) was not significant ly different from placebo at 24\u00b77% (95% CI -64\u00b77, 66\u00b74). This may, in part, be explained by the antigenic drift observed in the dominant circulating H3N2 strain. Although the lack of efficacy could be explained by poor IIV3 immunogenicity in an HIV -infected population, the study was also underpowered . The required sample size of 4 20 to detect 50% reduction in influenza was based on a n assumed attack rate of 20% , whereas the observed attack rate in placebo recipi ents was only 10%. Vaccine effectiveness (against RT -PCR-confirmed symptomatic influenza ) of IIV3 in children aged 6 months to 10 years was estimated from a test negative case -control study in Kenya.20 The study was undertaken during a 3 -year period where the Kenya Medical Research Instit ute/Centers for Disease Control -Kenya and Kenyan Ministry o f Health offered free influenza vaccine to children in two low-income rural and urban settings . Approximately 35% of all eligible children were vaccinated (2 doses IIV3 if aged <9 years). Patients attending with symptoms meeting pre -defined ALRI/ILI criter ia were tes ted for influenza using RT -PCR. Controls were matched for ag e, date of sample and study site. Effectiveness estimates were controlled for the interval between symptom onset to sample collection. The combined results for the 3 -year study found a vaccine effectiveness of 48 \u00b74% (95% CI 31 \u00b75, 61 \u00b72). The overall effectiveness was 50\u00b72% (95% CI 24 \u00b79, 66\u00b79) in 6 months olds and 46 \u00b72% (95% CI 19\u00b72, 64\u00b72) in 5 to <10 -year olds. The main limitations of the study are those inherent in the test -negative case control design , which include possible differences between those seeking health care for ALRI/ILI and the general population. HIV testing was not routi nely performed. 1% of subjects were known to be HIV -infected, with overall adult HIV prevalence 17% and 14% in the rural and urban setting respective ly. Only medically -attended cases of ALRI/ILI were included , thereby missing community -managed cases . Nevertheless, this study provides the most robust IIV3 vaccine effectiveness estimates to date in African children and includes data from two diverse and economically deprived s ettings. Influenza vaccination in elderly adults Three studies have assessed the efficacy or effectiveness of influenza vaccines in elderly adults , all conducted in South Africa (Supplementary table 1 ).16-18 The two randomis ed trials16,17 were conducted in community -dwelling ambulatory adults 60 years , where approximately 70% of participants were white. Both trials included the use of LAIV, which is unlicensed for adults >49 years in the US A, and thought to be less effective than IIV3 among elderly adults based on observational data .16 A randomis ed, double -blind, placebo -controlled study16 showed 21 with 52 CI 32 \u00b71, 67 \u00b72) efficacy against A/H3N2 strains and no efficacy against influenza B strain s (- 10\u00b71%, 95% CI -113\u00b70, 42 \u00b77). Although the reason for the poor performance against vacci ne- matched influenza B strains is not clear, seroconversion to the influenza B vaccine component was lower than to A/H3N2 (figure 3). Vaccine efficacy was no t significantly different between participants aged 60 -69 years and those >70 years old. A randomised, open -label trial compared the relative efficacy of IIV3 and LAIV in adults 60 years17 against culture -confirmed symptomatic influenza . The study was powered on an assumed influenza attack rate of 8%, with non -inferiority between the two arms. The incidence of influenza was much lower than expected at 0\u00b79% in LAIV and 1\u00b75% in IIV3 arms . As such , the study was significantly underpowered and no robust conclusions were possible . Finally, a retrospective nested case -control study in adults 65 ye ars registered in a private medical funding organis ation assessed influenza vaccine effectiveness against hospitalisation for acute respiratory conditions, non -elective cardiovascular disease, or all -cause death .18 Altho ugh not explicitly stated, participants presumably received IIV3 , as to our knowledge LAIV was not available for routine clinical care in South Afric a. Each c ase presenting with any of the primary endpoints were matche d (by case identification date) to four randomly chosen controls from the same cohort and vaccination status ascertained from health records to calculate vaccine effectiveness . After adjustment for a number of confounders (e.g. comorbiditi es, age, gender), influenza vaccination was associated with a statistically significant reduction in the combined primary outcome measures by 19 \u00b73% (95% CI 3 \u00b71, 32 \u00b79) and all -cause alone by 23 \u00b76% (95% CI 1 \u00b70, 41\u00b70). However, a post hoc sensitivity analysis suggest ed that a healthy user bias in the likelihood of receiving influenza vaccine could potentially explai n the vaccine effectiveness estimates seen. Influenza vaccination in other populations HIV-infected a dults : In addition to the studies above including HIV -infected subjects , a double -blind, randomised, single centre, placebo -controlled trial of IIV3 in HIV -infected adults aged 18 -55 years was performed in South Africa (Supplementary table 1 ).25 Participants had either been on first -line antire troviral therapy (ART) for 3 months or were ART -na\u00efve with a CD4+ count >100 cells/\u00b5l. Vaccine efficacy (against culture and/or RT -PCR-confirmed symptomatic influenza ) was 75\u00b75% (95% CI 9 \u00b72, 95 \u00b76) for strains a non-significant 73 \u00b73% (95% CI -1\u00b72, 95 \u00b72) for vaccine -matched strains. No significant reductions in ILI or ARI was seen . The study was underpowered as 312 participants per study group were required to detect a 30% reduction in influenza , assuming an attack rate of 40% in the placebo arm. Onl y 255 and 251 participant s were recruited to the IIV3 and placebo arms respectively and only 4 \u00b77% of placebo recipients developed influenza. Healthcare personnel : A prospective c ohort study was carried out in healthcare personnel across five Kenyan hospitals (Supplementary table 1 ).26 Participants were asked about vaccination status during a monovalent pdm09 H1N1 influenza vaccination campaign. The study controlled for month of follow up, gender, age, hospital location and contact with patients. The study failed to find an association between vaccination and reduced incidence of acute respirato ry illness, work days missed, or RT-PCR- confirmed influenza. As only 2/531 specimens tested detected pdm09 H1N1, low circulating levels of pdm09 H1N1 may explain the negative findings . Miscellaneous populations : Four test -negative case -control studies were identified from South Africa whi ch estimate vaccine effectiveness across all age groups (Supplementary table 1 ).27-30 All originated from the same research team , using a network of general practitioners based in all provinc es of South Africa ( ~90% within private healthcare centres). Patients presenting with an ILI had a throat and/or nasal swab tested for influenza by viral culture or RT-PCR. Influenza positive patients were classified as cases and influenza negative patients as unmatched controls. The first study estimated vaccine effectiveness between 2005 and 2009.27 Age-adjusted effe ctiveness was (95% CI -21\u00b75, 60 \u00b71) in 2009 . Details of vaccine and circulating strain match are shown in supplementary table 1 . The authors adjusted for age but no additional confounders. During 2009 , the number of samples which each sentinel site could se nd was limited to five per week due to limited laboratory testing capacity. Sample selection was at the practitioner's discretion, which could have introduced selection bias. McAnerney et al .29 estimated vaccine effectiveness between 2010 and 2013 and adjusted for age , underlying medical conditions and seasonality. Adjusted vaccine effectiveness was 54 \u00b72% (95% CI 2 \u00b74, 78\u00b76) in 2010, 57 \u00b71% % CI in 2011, 38 \u00b74% CI -71\u00b77, and 87 \u00b72% (95% CI 67 \u00b72, 95\u00b70) in 2013. The vaccine effectiveness in 201428 and 2015,30 adjusting for age, underlying medical conditions and seasonality , 43\u00b71% 76\u00b75) respectively . The years of poor vaccine effectiveness w ere mainly related to antigenic drift resulting in vaccine and circulating strain mismatch, although small sample size in some years may also have contributed. As the data are from primary care settin gs, vaccine effectiveness against severe influenza is not included. Finally, as sentinel sites are priv ate health care facilities where <20% of the South African populatio n seek healthcare, the generalis ability of these findings may be limited. Studies assessing immunogenicity of influenza vaccin es Twelve studies were identified that evaluated influenza va ccine immunogenicity,11-13,15 - 17,19,21,22,25,32,33 the majority of which focus ed on haemagglutination inhibition (HAI) titres, considered at present to be the gold standard immune correlate of protection following immunisation .35 This is, however, primarily true following IIV3 and not LAIV (which does not induce potent serum HAI responses) , and where a clear correlate of protection is not yet established . Figure 3 shows G eometric Mean Fold Rise (GMFR) following vaccination for studies where this is reported or can be calculated . Two studies evaluated IIV3 immunogenicity in pregnancy .11,15 Pregnant women in South Africa mounted robust HAI titres following vaccination to all strains (Figure 3). In Mali, only HAI responses to pdm09H1N1 (HIV-negative women ) are reported , which were higher than those seen to pdm09H1N1 in South African HIV -negative women (GMFR 14 \u00b79 vs 6 \u00b79). The me an age at enrolment was similar in the two studies (24 \u00b77 vs 26 \u00b72 years), but gestational age at enrolment was highe r in Mali than in South Africa (32 \u00b76 vs 26 \u00b78 weeks). Pre-vaccination geometric mean titres (GMT) to pdm09H1N1 were 30 \u00b70 in South Africa and 20 \u00b79 in Mali. The reasons for this GMFR difference is unclear, but highlights the potential for variable responses in diffe rent African populations . Transfer of influenza -specific antibodies to infants following maternal immunisation and durability of this immunity was explored .11,13,15 In South Africa, HIV-unexposed children had higher HAI geometric mean titres (GMT) than HIV -exposed uninfected children 48 \u00b72), H3N2 (41 \u00b74 vs \u00b74) and influenza B (86 \u00b77 vs 50 \u00b70) at 7 days after birth . Both groups had significantly higher titres than placebo recipients. Follow up of the HIV -unexposed children in the first 6 months13 showed rapid waning of HAI GMTs to all antigens, with the proportion of children with HAI 1:40 dropping from 78 \u00b73% (pdm09H1 N1), 56 \u00b76% (H3N2) and 81 \u00b71% (influenza at birth to 39 \u00b75%, 19 \u00b71% and 40% respectively by 16 weeks. Similar observations were found in Mali ,15 where HIV -unexposed children had HAI GMT to pdm09H1N1 of 141 \u00b76 at birth, 39 \u00b70 at 2 -3 months and 33 \u00b77 at 4 -5 mont hs of age. The impact of helminths on IIV3 immunogenicity was evaluated in Gabon , in children aged 7 to 12 years21 from rural and semi -urban settings. Although exact HAI titres are not provided, children from semi -urban set tings had significantly higher HAI responses (H1N1 and influenza B) than those from rural areas. The presence of helminths was associated wi th poorer immun ogenicity . A follow up study22 failed to show a significant effect of albendazole on HAI respons e to IIV3, although the study was po wered for a much higher helminth burden than observed . Serum HAI increases following LAIV in elde rly adults from South Africa were low, in keeping with previous studies of LAIV (Figure 3).16,17 HAI responses to IIV3 were lower in individuals aged 70 years compared to those aged 60 - 69 years .17 The impact of HIV infection on IIV3 immunogenicity in both adults and children in South Africa is explored in three studies .11,19,25 HAI titre GMFR in HIV+ve pregnant women was <50% of the GMFR seen in HIV -ve pregnant women ( 2.9 vs 6.9, 2.4 vs 6.0 and 3.2 vs 10.0 for pdm09H1N1, H3N2 and influenza B respecti vely, figure 3). Adults on ART had significantly higher seroconversion rates than ART-na\u00efve patients to all antigens (Figure 3). HIV - infected chil dren aged 6 - 35 months had significantly lower seroconversion rates th an those aged 36 - 59 months to H3N2 (34 \u00b78% vs 70 \u00b76%), with similar trends for H1N1 (39 \u00b71% vs 58 \u00b78%) and influenza B (34 \u00b78% vs 47\u00b71%). Two immunogenicity studies focused on antibody re sponses other than HAI.32,33 A study of healthy white South Africa n students investigated anti-haemagglut inin and anti -neuraminidase antibody rises (single radial disc diffusion) following inactivated and live vaccine s.32 Anti-haemagglu tinin responses were observed in >60% of individuals and were similar in all vaccine groups . Anti- neuraminidase responses were identified in a greater proportion of inactivated vaccine recipients (p<0.05) . The second study focused on Natural Killer cell responses to IIV3 in The Gambia .33 Anti- IIV3 IgG concentrations were significantly boosted by vaccination in children (2-6 years old) and young adults (20-30 years old) but not in older adults (60 -70 years old). Conclusions and future directions Our systematic review identified only 23 published studies evaluating efficacy, effectiveness or immunogenicity of influenza vaccines in Africa . As such, we did not exclude studies based on limitations in methodological design , to provide a complete pictur e of the available data. Due to the heterogeneity in study design, age group and vaccin e type, a meta -analysis of these data are not possible. Several RCTs were underpowered, due to over -estimates of influenza attack rates, highlighting the importance of r obust influenza incidence data to inform study design and sample size calculations. Improved influenza surveillance systems would help provide this, as well as a means to calculate vaccine effectiveness following influ enza vaccine rollout . Other reasons why several studies failed to produce conclusi ve results include antigenic drift and unpredictability of dominant circulating strains each year . Estimating required sample sizes based on individual strain attack rates could avoid a loss of power d ue to antigenic drift, as it is unusual for all strains to drift significantly in one season . Quadrivalent vaccines containing both B -Yamagata and B -Victoria lineages should ideally be used to further minimise vaccine mismatch. No studies specifically add ressed the impact of time of vaccination and influenza seasonality on vaccine performance . In contrast to temperate climates , countries in Africa experience year -round transmission or exhibit several peaks of transmission (some coinciding with rainy season s).8,36,37 Vaccine strategies such as biannual influenza vaccination need further consideration .38 As the timing of vaccine availability is currently dictated by requirements for temperate countries, more data are required on the suitability of these vaccine formulations for contemporaneous strains in the tropics . Several other factors likely to effect influenza vaccine performance were under -represented . Placental malaria infection and maternal hypergammaglobulinaemia are known to effect placental antibody transfer9 and the impact of these conditions on maternal immunisation strategies should be studied. The impact of factors such as HIV, malnutrition and TB a lso require further study to understand the effect on influenza vaccination. While it is difficult to draw firm conclusions about the relative effectiveness of influenza vaccines in HIC and L MIC from the data currently available, the most comprehensive effectiveness data (from South Africa)27-30 shows a similar range when compared with USA effectiveness data from the same years ( Appendix ).39 Our review also highlights the need to obtain data f rom a broader range of African populations, with 1 6 of the 2 3 studies performed in South Africa. Even with in these studies, se veral were performed in groups that may not be representative of the wider socioeconomic makeup in the country . Given the genetic and environmental heterogeneity acro ss Africa , further studies to explore any regional variation in vaccine efficacy are important. Studies should include immunogenicity measures to provide insight into any findings observed. While s ome studies we identified measured serum HAI to assess IIV3 immunogenicity, LAIV studies should include measures of mucosal antibody and systemic T -cell responses as LAIV likely protects via multiple mechanisms. Our own ongoing study of LAIV in Gambian children (NCT02972957) hopes to shed light on the reasons for the poor LAIV efficacy in Senegal.24 The majority o f studies used laboratory -confirmed influenza illness as a primary outcome and no strong conclusions c ould be drawn for severe outcomes such as hospitalisa tion, medically - attended pneumonia or mortality. These outcomes are important for policy decisions on the implementation of future influenza vaccine programmes40 and demonstrati on of mortality benefit following vaccination is a criterion for GAVI investment .41 The reduction in all -cause ALRI and severe infant pneumonia following maternal immunizati on in South Africa is encouraging but clearly more data are required .14,31 The only two studies of LAIV efficacy in African chi ldren have provided dramatically contrasting results .23,24 It is possible that the recent lack of efficacy in S enegal seen is unique to the pdm09H1N1 strain and simply mirrors the poor effectiveness of LAIV against pdm09H1N1 observed in the USA .42 If ongoing efforts to improve this LAIV component a re successful, further RCTs would be warranted in African populations given the greater efficacy of LAIV seen in children when compared to IIV3 in previous studies .43,44 Furthermore, lower manufacturing costs compared to IIV3 (partly as less antigen is required therefore allowing more doses per egg) and less need for trained healthcare personnel to deliver an intranasal vaccine make LAIV particular ly suitable in Africa . The potential for successful LAIV rollout to provide indirect benefit by reducing transmission to unvaccinated vulnerable populations (shown recently i n the UK )45 should also be assessed . Data are also not available on how best to immunise 6 month s - 2- year old children, an age group that responds poorly t o IIV3 and are outside the licence for LAIV use. The results are awaited of a safety and immunogenicity study comparing MF59TM-adjuvanted IIV3 with standard IIV3 (NCT01819155) in Senegalese children aged 6 to 71 months . The lack of any robust IIV3 efficacy data in the elderly is str iking. Even in HIC, standard IIV3 are only modestly immunogenic due to immunosenescence .46 The use of MF59 -adjuvan ted IIV3 and high dose IIV3 have emerged as two strategies to enhance the i mmuno genicity and efficacy of influenza vaccines in this high -risk group .47,48 To our knowledge, there are no ongoing studies of these vaccines in Africa and should be the focus of future studies in elderly populations. With the increasing burden of cardiovascular disease in LMIC , the potential for influenza vaccination to prevent stroke and heart disease is also important to consider. An ongo ing multi centre RCT of influenza vaccine to prevent adverse vascular events (R CT-IVVE, NCT 02762851) aims to include adults aged 18 years from several African sites with study completi on estimated in 2020. Another benefit of influenza vaccination may be reduction of pneumococcal pneumo nia. The importance of influenza in the pathogenesis of pneumococcal pneumonia was d emonstrated by the reduction of virus -associated pneumonia in an RCT of Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine (PCV ) in South African children .49 Furthermore, the reduction in all -cause infant ALRI following maternal immunization , despite negligible influenza dete ction in placebo recipients , supports an impact of influenza vaccination on reducing bacterial pneumonia .14 An RCT of combined influenza vaccine and PCV in several high risk groups would be valuable , especially in the context of increasing pneumococcal disease due to non -vaccine serotypes. The lower immunogenicity of IIV3 in HIV -infected patients in HIC is also reflected in the few stud ies from Africa, although due to the increased susceptibility t o influenza in these individuals, the benefits of vaccination are greater. As ART -treated individuals mount higher immune responses to IIV3 than ART -na\u00efve patients , increasing ART rollout could improve vaccine performance. With the high burden of HIV infection in many African countries, new vaccine strategies to enhance immunogenicity are required , for example, the use of high -dose o r adjuvanted vaccines . Results are awaited from a systems vaccinology study of IIV3 in H IV-infected individuals in Uganda (NCT01916759) that may provide mechanistic insight int o how best to do this. Such studies are important in informing rational design of new vaccines suite d to the population in need. The most robust data available at present to guide influenza vaccination programmes is in pregnant women. Two RCTs11,15 have demonstrated the efficacy of IIV3 in reducing influenza in pregnant women and their infants, although for the latter group , vaccine efficacy was only significant in HIV -unexposed infants . Protection for infants via maternal immunisation is especially important given the high influenza -related morbidity and mortality in infants <6 months50 and the lack of a licensed vaccine in this age group. N evertheless, both serum HAI and efficacy waned rapidly by four months of age, so alternative strategies are require d to increase titres in pregnant women and durability of infant protection . Future studies will a dditionally need to focus on the cost-effect iveness, feasibility and acceptabili ty of maternal immunis ation in line with the deliberations for other vaccines applicable in pregnancy. A recent analysis in Mali showed that such a programme would be cost -effective in most settings if vaccine can be obtained, ma naged and administered for $1\u00b700 per pregnant woman .51 Ideally health economic analyses should take into account a wider range o f potential benefits: impact on bacterial pneumonia, indirect benefit s due to reduced transmission, impact on antibiotic use ,52 although more data are required to inform these aspects . Furthermore, as the burden of influenza is high in Africa, even imperfe ct vaccine effectiveness can lead to a greater number of absolute cases prevented and significant public health benefit. Finally, as countries in Africa establish influenza immunisation programmes, i t is vital that this is done alongside increased capacity for influenza surveillance , so ongoing vaccine effectiveness can be monitored over time.
