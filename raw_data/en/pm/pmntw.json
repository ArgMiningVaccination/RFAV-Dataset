Better yet, this post won't just cover seasonal bugs, I will also give you the fundamentals you need for everyday life using natural remedies. Interested? Let's get into my guide on a complete all-natural medicine cabinet! The Complete Guide to a Natural Medicine Cabinet As a child whenever I caught a cold, had overactive allergies, or had scraped knees and elbows my mom would always reach for conventional remedies like Tylenol, Benadryl, Neosporin, and other over-the-counter medications. Little did she know, most of the \"remedies\" she was giving us had unpronounceable ingredients and more side effects than they were worth. As a way to lighten the toxic burden on our bodies as well as save you time, money, and peace of mind, I'm going to list my top resources for staying well all year round. Now, I'm not saying that conventional medicine has no place; it most certainly does! However, what I would like to show you is that there is a multitude of safe and natural alternatives that do a fabulous job aiding the body in healing itself without nasty side effects. How to Begin Building your Natural Medicine Cabinet First and foremost, if you go out and buy all of these things now it's going to be expensive. My advice is to buy these things only as you need them. It's also a great idea to shop around in order to find the best deal available.
