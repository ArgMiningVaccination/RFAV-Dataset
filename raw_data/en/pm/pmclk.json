Osteopathy Pregnancy is synonymous with changes in the body and osteopathy can relieve many pregnancy-related ailments and possible pain for mothers-to-be as well as babies. This gentle method can soothe the mind and body during and after pregnancy and if the newborn experiences any pain or discomfort. Acupuncture Acupuncture, as a branch of traditional Chinese medicine, aims to regulate the enegetics balance. During and after pregnancy, acupuncture helps to prevent or treat various ailments (anxiety, nausea, digestive and venous disorders, ...) and has the great advantage of being an alternative to medication, often contraindicated during this period. You can book an aromatherapy session in addition to an acupuncture session. Aromatherapy Aromatherapy is the use of aromatic compounds extracted from plants, (also called essential oils), for medicinal purposes. Aromatherapy is part of the field of phytotherapy (medicine based on plant extracts and natural active ingredients). You can book an aromatherapy session in addition to an acupuncture session. You also have the option of asking our midwives about the use of aromatherapy in the delivery room. These services offered by our clinic are reserved for our patients from the beginning of pregnancy until eight weeks after delivery.
