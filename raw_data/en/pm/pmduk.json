At RWJBarnabas Health, we're proud to be a key part of the effort to get the vaccine into the arms of all eligible people in New Jersey. We also remain committed to fighting the spread of the disease. That's why we join with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in urging everyone, whether vaccinated or not, to continue with the simple precautions we know are effective in preventing the spread of the coronavirus: Wear a mask. Stay at least six feet apart from people who don't live with you and avoid crowds. Wash your hands thoroughly and often; use a hand sanitizer if soap and water aren't available. The reason for this continued caution: In some cases, COVID-19 vaccines may protect against severe infection, but may not necessarily prevent mild or asymptomatic infection. If this is the case, an infected person could still spread the virus. At Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital Hamilton, we continue to fight COVID-19 by providing vaccinations to staff and community members who meet New Jersey criteria with a convenient, efficient process. With so many questions arising about COVID-19 vaccines, we are working diligently to provide as much information as possible in print, online and on the air to all consumers. Our priority is to ensure that everyone has the answers they need to make an empowered decision about the vaccine. When it's your turn, we encourage you to take whichever vaccine option is available to you\u2014and feel confident doing so. It will take all of us working together as a community to minimize the ongoing effects of COVID-19. Together, we can protect friends, family and neighbors and end this pandemic. Yours in good health,Let's Beat COVID-19 Healthy Together | 2 | Spring 2021 RWJUHH_Memo_Spring21_Final.indd 2 3/16/21 2:53 PMTo learn more or to make a vaccination appointment, visit www.rwjbh.org/covid19 .\"At the outset, we knew we would be helping with the COVID-19 vaccination effort,\" says John Bonamo, MD, MS, Executive Vice President and Chief Medical and Quality Officer at RWJBarnabas Health (RWJBH). \"But we weren't aware just how much the state would be relying on healthcare systems to make this happen.\" Just as they did when the pandemic first hit, the experts at RWJBH rose to the challenge. \"We opened our first vaccine clinic the week the vaccine came out in December,\" he recounts. \"Then we opened clinics at each of our 11 acute care hospitals.\" RWJBH is also administering the vaccine at the Middlesex County megasite in Edison, which it runs; the former Sears in the Livingston Mall; RWJBarnabas Health Arena in Toms River; Brookdale Community College in Monmouth County; and smaller clinics, including in Bayonne and in the Greenville section of Jersey City. \"We're also assisting municipal efforts in four counties\u2014Ocean, Somerset, Essex and Monmouth\u2014 by providing some or all vaccinators for their clinics,\" Dr. Bonamo says, \"and we're partnering with the state, the National Guard and others. In addition, we've applied for more vaccination sites for physician offices.\" As of mid-March, RWJBH had already vaccinated approximately 150,500 people and was vaccinating more at the rate of 2,000 a day at its hospitals and 4,000 a day at the Edison megasite. However, Dr. Bonamo says that number will increase significantly as vaccine availability does. \"We're ramping up,\" he says. \"We're in this to get it done.\" By summer, Dr. Bonamo says, vaccine supplies will make it available to all who want it. The challenge will shift to making sure everyone who's eligible chooses to be vaccinated. DISPELLING FEARS \"Many people started out with 'vaccine hesitancy'\u2014they wanted to see how other people did with the vaccine first,\" says Dr. Bonamo. \"As they saw others feeling good about having had the vaccine, they became more open to it.\" That led to the clamor for vaccination appointments the state saw in the winter. Vaccine hesitancy persists, however. \"There's understandable mistrust, especially in the black community, born of all the social inequity and healthcare injustice that has happened over the years,\" he says. \"We're working hard to dispel that with all kinds of outreach and town halls being done by healthcare professionals of color.\" Older adults should prioritize getting the vaccine, Dr. Bonamo says. \"The years they have are precious, and many seniors who got COVID-19 did not do well,\" he says. \"Often, that's because they have at least one other comorbidity\u2014diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, kidney disease, lung disease or obesity\u2014that contributes to their risk.\" Dr. Bonamo emphasizes that his message isn't just for certain groups, but for everybody who's eligible for the vaccine. \"Get vaccinated,\" he says. \"That's it. It's safe, it's smart, it's advanced science and it's the right thing to do to protect yourself and your family.\" JOHN BONAMO, MD AS AVAILABILITY INCREASES, EXPERTS HAVE ONE STRONG MESSAGE FOR THE PUBLIC: GET THE SHOT.VACCINATING NEW JERSEY Healthy Together | PB | Spring 2021 RWJBarnabas Health | RWJBH.ORG | 3 System_CovidVaccine_Spr21_Final.indd 3 3/17/21 11:35 AMCLASSES FOR HEALTHY LIVING In-person classes will be limited in size and held at the RWJUH Hamilton Fitness & Wellness Center.

With the right treatments, they can live full, productive lives, says Jill Giordano-Farmer, DO, MPH, director of the Parkinson's Disease & Movement Disorders Program at The Center for Neurosciences at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital (RWJUH) Hamilton. Here, she explains how she cares for patients. What is your treatment philosophy? I form partnerships with patients so I can have ongoing discussions with them about these chronic neurologic conditions. Patients' needs change throughout the course of the diseases. How has the pandemic changed the way you're caring for patients? I'm providing routine follow-up care and seeing new patients via telemedicine and office visits. I can get 90 percent of the information I need just by observing patients. I can see a person's tremor, stiffness and balance when he or she walks. For a new patient, I can gather information about the person's medical history, symptoms and past medications. I can also ask him or her to perform certain movements to assess joint stiffness. How are patients treated? Parkinson's disease is due to a deficiency of dopamine, a brain chemical. Patients do best with a combination of medication, rehabilitation and exercise. Injections of botulinum toxin can relax a person's muscles, and surgical treatments can improve tremor and stiffness.

To connect with one of NJ's top cardiovascular specialists, call 888.724.7123 or visit www.rwjbh.org/heart .Everyone experiences an increased heart rate at some point. You exercise, and your heart rate increases. You become frightened or stressed, and your heart beats faster. You might experience the increased heart rate as a skipped beat, a flutter or a pounding in your chest. \"A temporary increase in heart rate has many causes,\" says David Dobesh, MD, Chief of Cardiac Electrophysiology at Jersey City Medical Center and a member of RWJBarnabas Health Medical Group with offices in Jersey City and West Orange. \"Emotional stress, physical stress, psychological stress, even things like caffeine, nicotine, too much alcohol or fever. Your body is performing a complex balancing act with your pulse.\" A lesser-known but common source of increased heart rate is medication, including some kinds of over-the- counter medicines and certain prescriptions. \"People should be aware that some medicines dobriefly increase your heart rate,\" says Dr. Dobesh, \"and usually those episodes are not something you should be concerned about.\" POSSIBLE CAUSES Common medications that may increase heart rate for a short period of time include: Decongestants, specifically those that contain pseudoephedrine, a stimulant. \"If the decongestant has a capital 'D' at the end of its name, it contains this ingredient,\" says Dr. Dobesh. Some inhalers for asthma, emphysema or COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). Theophylline, an oral asthma medication. Medications for ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder). Diuretic medications (used to help prevent fluid retention) could result in dehydration, says Dr. Dobesh. Some blood pressure medications may inadvertently lower blood pressure too much. \"If your pressure is very low from either dehydration or overmedication, the body will respond by increasing the heart rate to compensate,\" he explains.\"Some medications carry warning labels about increased heart rate but in practice this side effect is unusual,\" Dr. Dobesh says. \"These include certain antidepressants and also thyroid medications, which will not usually increase heart rate if they're taken at the recommended dose.\" Similarly, herbal supplements such as ginseng, valerian root and orange bitters should not increase heart rate when taken in normal doses, he says. While a short-term increase in heart rate from medication or emotional or physical stress is normal, increased heart rate that lasts for a long time is not. \"If you're repeatedly feeling symptoms of a racing heartbeat that make you uncomfortable, tell your doctor,\" advises Dr. Dobesh. \"Further testing may be appropriate.\"WHAT IS TACHYCARDIA? For most people, a heart rate between 60 and 100 beats per minute (bpm) is normal. When your heart beats more than 100 bpm for reasons unrelated to physiological stress, that's known as tachycardia, from the Greek words for \"swift\" and \"heart.\" If increased heart rate is a concern, basic testing, such as an electrocardiogram or blood work, can be done to determine whether you should be referred to an electrophysiologist\u2014a cardiologist who specializes in heart rhythms. The electrophysiologist will look for possible types of tachycardia that are caused by an abnormality of the heart itself and can affect how well the heart pumps blood. Examples include atrial fibrillation (AFib), atrial flutter and supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). A wide range of treatments may be considered, including lifestyle changes, medications and medical and surgical procedures.

But what does it mean for a patient? \"For a cancer patient, the question of where to be treated can be terribly confusing. The NCI designation tells a layperson that the institution is among the top centers in the country for delivering cancer care and performing research,\" says Steven K. Libutti, MD, Senior Vice President, Oncology Services, for RWJBarnabas Health (RWJBH) and Director, Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey\u2014the state's only NCI-Designated Comprehensive Cancer Center.

THE PATH TO A PRESTIGIOUS DESIGNATION This year marks the 50th anniversary of the National Cancer Act, which established the NCI Cancer Centers program. Out of the thousands of U.S. facilities that have cancer programs, just 51 are NCI-Designated Comprehensive Cancer Centers. The NCI designation is a grant that brings significant dollars to the Rutgers Cancer Institute and has a positive economic impact on the state of New Jersey. Rutgers A RARE T-CELL LYMPHOMA Ling Jin needed treatment for a rare and aggressive form of T-cell lymphoma, requiring high-dose chemotherapy and radiation treatments in preparation for an allogeneic stem cell transplantation, sometimes referred to as a bone marrow transplant. As she underwent chemotherapy, a lymphoma was discovered behind her eye, which was resolved through brief and highly targeted proton beam therapy. After an extensive database search, an appropriate donor for bone marrow cells was found, and last June, Ling had a successful stem cell transplant at Rutgers Cancer Institute.BREAST CANCER WHILE PREGNANT Breast cancer survivor Liz Tague found out she was pregnant\u2014and soon after, learned that her breast cancer had recurred. After consulting with an oncologist in New York, Liz opted to have her treatment closer to home, guided by Rutgers Cancer Institute and RWJBarnabas Health. Following a lumpectomy and chemotherapy, Liz gave birth to a healthy son. Now it was time to consider radiation therapy to prevent further recurrence. Her doctors proposed proton beam therapy, which can be precisely targeted to spare previously irradiated tissues. Three years later, Liz is back to work as a teacher and enjoying family time with her toddler.STAGE 4 KIDNEY CANCER Jim Gritschke was fit and active, but weight loss and sharp pains in his right leg led him to an orthopedic surgeon. The diagnosis: a large tumor on his kidney from metastatic renal cell carcinoma, which had spread to his pelvis.

Libutti, MD Healthy Together | 10 | Spring 2021 RWJBarnabas Health | RWJBH.ORG | 11 System_CancerNCI_Spr21_final.indd 11 3/16/21 11:32 AM, BEING AWARE OF THE SYMPTOMS CAN KEEP YOU OR A LOVED ONE SAFE. of misdiagnosis,\" says neurosurgeon Anil Nanda, MD, MPH, Senior Vice President of Neurological Services for RWJBarnabas Health and Chairman, Department of Neurosurgery, for Rutgers-New Jersey Medical School and Robert Wood Johnson Medical School. \"We have seen an increase in ruptured aneurysms during the COVID-19 pandemic. This may be because people have been less active during this period, perhaps gaining weight or not controlling high blood pressure,\" he says. People who may have warning signs of an aneurysm often neglect them, assuming they'll simply go away, he says. In addition, many people have avoided seeking care because of fear of going to a hospital during the pandemic. \"The classic symptom is a severe headache\u2014one that feels like the worst headache of your life,\" Dr. Nanda explains. \"Not every headache is an aneurysm, of course, and most of the time it's not anything serious. But if you have this terrible headache along with neck stiffness, and bright light bothers you, you should go to the Emergency Department to have it investigated.\" ADVANCED TREATMENTS Aneurysms can be diagnosed by a CT (computed tomography) scan, which uses X-rays to determine whether blood has leaked into the brain. Doctors may also order an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging), which uses computer- generated radio waves to create detailed images of the brain. Other diagnostic tests include About one in 50 people in the U.S. has a brain aneurysm\u2014a \"balloon\" of blood protruding from an artery. The majority of these will never burst or even require treatment. For those whose aneurysms do burst, however\u2014approximately 30,000 people each year\u2014the consequences can be devastating, leading to brain damage, stroke or death. \"We want to raise awareness about aneurysms because some studies have shown that almost a quarter of people who have a ruptured aneurysm die because BRAIN ANEURYSMS: WHAT TO KNOW ANIL NANDA, MD Healthy Together | 12 | Spring 2021 RWJBarnabas Health | RWJBH.ORG | 13 System_BrainAneurysms_Spr21_final.indd 12 3/16/21 11:37 AM, a cerebral angiography, which is performed by passing a catheter (a long, flexible tube) from the groin artery to inject a small amount of contrast dye into the neck and brain arteries, and a cerebrospinal fluid analysis, which measures chemicals that indicate bleeding in the brain. \"If we do determine there is an aneurysm, whether it's ruptured or in danger of bursting, we look at the risk factors and determine the appropriate course of action. If surgery is indicated, we'll get our team together and perform it within 12 to 24 hours,\" says Dr. Nanda. \"For years, a procedure called clipping was the only way to fix an aneurysm,\" he explains. In this procedure, a craniotomy is performed to create an opening in the skull and then a small metal clip is placed on the aneurysm to stop the blood flow. \"Clipping is still the best solution for some cases,\" Dr. Nanda says. \"Today, however, the mainstay of treatment is coiling. We can thread the catheter through a groin artery to place a coil on the aneurysm, and there is no need to open the skull.\"TEAM OF EXPERTS Decisions about treatment are made on a case-by-case basis. \"We have a multidisciplinary team at RWJBarnabas Health and Rutgers,\" says Dr. Nanda. \"We have neurologists, neurosurgeons, a neuropsychologist, a neuroradiology team and endovascular specialists, all providing input about what will be most effective for the patient. We're like a special forces team, able to come together quickly. The patient gets 10 experts for a problem immediately, which is a huge advantage.\" Nurse practitioners, neurology nurses and neurophysiology technologists round out the care team. \"Another benefit of being part of a large system is that we have the advantage of research, clinical trials and education,\" Dr. Nanda says. \"We can do what we call translational research, meaning we take basic research that's being done on stroke and translate it into the clinical realm. It's a bench-to-bedside approach where we can really improve the condition of patients.\"WHAT IS A BRAIN ANEURYSM? A cerebral (brain) aneurysm is a weak spot on a brain artery that balloons or bulges out and fills with blood. If it bursts, it spills blood into the surrounding tissue, an event that's called a hemorrhage. Brain cells, deprived of oxygen, begin to die, and the patient may have a stroke.

We don't want to see our patients develop life-threatening issues like encephalitis from measles or meningitis from Haemophilus influenzae type B, which are prevented by safe, routine childhood vaccinations.\" \"Parents have been hesitant to bring their children to doctors' offices or clinics for fear of exposing them to COVID-19,\" explains Patricia Whitley- Williams, MD, a pediatric infectious disease specialist at the Bristol-Myers Squibb Children's Hospital at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital and Division Chief of Allergy, Immunology and Infectious Diseases at Rutgers- Robert Wood Johnson Medical School. \"However, these offices are following all the recommended guidelines fromthe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,\" Dr. Whitley-Williams says. \"Offices are sanitized in between patient appointments, plastic barriers are up, patients and visitors are checked for fever and masks are worn.\" (For children, wearing a mask is recommended over the age of two years.) \"Pediatricians' offices have protocols in place to keep well children and sick children apart,\" adds Dr. Hasan. \"Some set aside special time periods just for vaccinations. Many places require that people check in over the phone and wait outside in their cars. Patients and families then are brought straight into the office, so there's no exposure to other people in a waiting room.\" Parents who have safety concerns should contact their pediatrician's office to ensure that proper safety measures are in place, the doctors advise. FOLLOW THE SCHEDULE Timing is important when it comes to childhood vaccinations, Dr. Hasan says. \"Please don't put off having your child vaccinated because you think it's better to space the shots out,\" she says. \"The schedule of vaccines has been carefully determined to minimize risk and get the best response for each age.\" The recommended schedule for routine childhood vaccinations can be found at www.cdc.gov/vaccines. Expectant mothers should get the Tdap vaccine to protect the baby against pertussis, sometime between the 27th and 36th weeks of pregnancy, the CDC recommends. \"That vaccine has been a game changer for protecting vulnerable newborns,\" Dr. Hasan says. One vaccine many parents are eager to explore for their children is the one for COVID-19, Dr. Hasan says. \"I can't tell you how many calls we get about that,\" she says. \"We're eagerly awaiting the results of trials so we have safety data for the younger age groups, particularly for vulnerable populations such as those with kidney, heart or lung disease.\" In the meantime, routine childhood vaccinations should proceed as advised by your pediatrician. \"Parents and guardians should be assured that these vaccines have been proven to be safe and effective,\" says Dr. Whitley-Williams, \"and they save lives.\"To find a pediatrician at RWJBarnabas Health, call 888.724.7123 or visit www.rwjbh.org/doctors .UZMA HASAN, MD DON'T DELAY ROUTINE VACCINATIONS THAT WILL KEEP YOUR CHILD SAFE FROM PREVENTABLE DISEASES.WHY CHILDHOOD VACCINATIONS CAN'T WAIT PATRICIA WHITLEY-WILLIAMS, MD Healthy Spring 2021 System_PediatricVaccin_Spr21_final.indd 14 3/16/21 11:39 AMAt Children's Specialized Hospital, we provide world-class care for children and young adults who face special health challenges across the state of New Jersey and beyond.

A competitive athlete, Olivia had been training for the Age Group Triathlon World Championships in August 2015 when she crashed her bike while riding at 27 miles per hour. The impact of the crash left Olivia suffering from a broken nose, a torn gluteus maximus and several strains in her legs. Though her injuries healed with time, her pain continued and got progressively worse. Finally, Olivia was diagnosed with Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS), a form of chronic pain that develops after an injury but gets worse over time. While CRPS is not well understood, it's thought that high levels of nerve impulses are sent to the affected site. Olivia tried several outpatient therapies, but her pain persisted, leaving her unable to do most social or physical activities. Even walking to the car after a therapy session was an ordeal. After researching other avenues for treatment, Olivia learned about the four-week Inpatient Chronic Pain Management Program at CSH. \"I was searching for a way to get my life back to normal,\" says Olivia. \"During the initial evaluation, they asked me what my goals for the program were, and the first thing that I said was that I wanted to race again.\" She entered the program in January 2016. WILL TO WIN During her time at CSH, Olivia learned techniques for moving in a way that would help her manage the pain. Her natural competitiveness came out during timed activities like learning how to step in and out of a tub, or going for a walk outside. \"I always strived to beat my time from the day before,\" she recalls. Swimming, aquatic therapy and group and individual psychotherapy helped her learn to desensitize herself to pain and function normally. After four weeks, Olivia was feeling more in control of her CRPS\u2014and ready to get back to her senior year of high school. By the end of that year, she had been accepted into a prestigious university and was back to competitive sports. In 2019, nearly four years after her accident, Olivia competed in the Age Group Triathlon World Championships, the same competition she'd been training for when she crashed her bike. Olivia recalls the moments before the competition began: \"I remember thinking, 'I can't believe I'm actually here!' And that's when it all hit me: There's no way I would have been able to do it if it weren't for my time at Children's Specialized Hospital. The treatment I got there gave me the chance to live out my dreams.\" For more information about Children's Specialized Hospital, call 888.244.5373 or visit www.rwjbh.org/childrensspecialized.A COMPETITIVE ATHLETE ACHIEVES HER DREAMS THANKS TO AN INNOVATIVE PAIN MANAGEMENT PROGRAM.A RACE AGAINST PAIN An RWJBarnabas Health facility Hard work at the Inpatient Chronic Pain Management Program enabled Olivia to compete in triathlons again.

Over the 22-year history of the partnership, RWJBH has hosted regular health fairs, blood drives and food drives, and has provided information on how community members can get access to key health services and screenings. Somerset Patriots players have benefited, too: RWJBH provides sports medicine services to keep players on the field of play. For kids, the Somerset Patriots, in partnership with the health system, created the Hit a Home Run Program. Featuring former pitcher Nate Roe, the education program for schools (delivered virtually this school year) is designed to teach young children how to eat healthier, make smarter lifestyle choices, be a good teammate and friend and understand the importance of exercise. FRIENDS IN NEED The Somerset Patriots team has been a stalwart supporter of RWJBH. Last summer, the organization raised more than $16,000 for the RWJBarnabas Health Emergency Response Fund to help support healthcare professionals as they served communities during the COVID-19 pandemic. The money was raised in a variety of ways, including online auctions, merchandise sales of T-shirts and face masks, a pop-up shopping event and drive-in movies at TD Bank Ballpark. \"We are so grateful to the Somerset Patriots for their continued support of our hospital and our community throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, from donations of food for our staff to hosting blood drives and holding events to benefit our Emergency Response Fund,\" says Tony Cava, President and CEO of Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital Somerset, a pillar of healthcare throughout Central New Jersey. \"Their ongoing support helps ensure that our community has access to the comprehensive healthcare services they need.\" A SOURCE OF PRIDE RWJBH employees, many of whom live locally, take great pride in the partnership, attending games and participating in group events.

Attendees received an email with a link to a video presentation entitled \"Beyond the Looking Glass.\" RWJUH Hamilton President and CEO Richard Freeman, Cancer Center staff members and the co-chairs of the event, Lisa Freeman and Ilana Gutierrez, were featured in the video. \"The purpose of the video was to paint a picture of our Cancer Center and everything it offers\u2014not only the clinical expertise but also all of the Holistic Services and the benefits they provide to patients,\" says Jessica Alleman, Director, Foundation and Development. Registration was free, and attendeeswere encouraged to donate to the Cancer Center's Holistic Programming. The event was a success; it raised more than $45,000. This year, We vs. C will be held in person on June 19 at the Brick Farm Tavern in Hopewell. A NEW TWIST ON THE GALA The innovative \"Gala in a Box\" was held on Friday, November 6. Attendees purchased boxes, which started at $250 for dinner for two. Each box included gift cards to a local restaurant and a local liquor store, a bottle of sparkling cider dipped in chocolate, a cocktail menu, coasters and napkins, and Spotify and Pandora playlists. The evening included a brief video presentation. More than 100 boxes were sold, and 10volunteers traveled more than 550 miles to hand-deliver them to people's homes, reports Alleman. Some attendees bought boxes and chose to donate them to hospital staff members, points out Alleman.

Their meals together sealed their bond as mothers, community members and friends. When they lost a member of the group to ovarian cancer in November 2019\u2014warm, spirited and driven Melissa McCormack, who was just 50\u2014the women changed the group's name to Melissa's Brigade. The nonprofit is now the Mercer County chapter of Lisa's Army, an organization that provides personalized care packages to comfort men, women and children battling cancer. MELISSA'S LEGACY The Cancer Center at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital (RWJUH) Hamilton recently began a partnership with Melissa's Brigade. Each month, nurses and doctors at RWJUH Hamilton nominate two cancer patients to receive comfort care packages that resemble the one Melissa cherished during her treatment for ovarian cancer. Valued at about $650, each package includes a collection of comforting and useful items, such as inspirational cards, an Apple iPad or Beats headphones, an iTunes gift card, journal and pen, \"queasy pops\" to help with nausea, shawl, cozy socks, puzzle books and a reusable drink bottle. For Melissa's Brigade, the packages represent the best of the woman who now fuels their efforts. \"I feel she's here with us, smiling and saying, 'Alright, girls, you've got this,'\" says Melissa's Brigade executive chair Sue Diefenbach. \"We all needed to continue to have some pieceof her, and we all identify these comfort care packages as that piece,\" says Amy K. Schuler, the group's RWJUH Hamilton chair. \"I think Melissa would be proud and honored and would see this as a beautiful way for us to stay together.\" A PARTNERSHIP FOR PATIENTS Launched in 2020, the Brigade's efforts are closely tied to those of Lisa's Army, which was created in memory of ovarian cancer patient Lisa Loonstyn-Golden. When Melissa received a Lisa's Army comfort care package during her treatment, she swooned over its contents with her Breakfast Club friends on a video call that left a lasting impression. \"It was such a bright moment,\" recalls Schuler. \"Melissa was so excited that people had thought of her, and she had all these wonderful items she needed.\" Captivated by the group's compassion and generosity, Melissa and her friends attended a Lisa's Army fundraising event in October 2019, just weeks before Melissa's death. Her friends have carried the torch ever since. The Brigade's formal kickoff event was a 5K walk/run held in October 2020. Afterward, the group decided to partner with RWJUH Hamilton Cancer Center. \"As a group, we toured the Cancer Center and felt it spoke to our mission, from the state-of-the-art equipment to the staff members' passion for patients,\" says Diefenbach. Cancer Center director Amy German, RN, also considers the partnership a great fit. The Center has a holistic program, which aims to support patients in body, mind and spirit. \"The comfort care packages will help patients get through their treatment,\" says German. \"2020 was a challenging year, and cancer treatment can be a lonely time. I think the comfort care packages are exactly what patients are looking for. They're like a hug.\" RWJUH Hamilton patients' reactions to the comfort care packages range from smiles to grateful tears. \"I've received notes expressing their appreciation,\" says Schuler. \"With the pandemic, patients often can't have anyone in the treatment room with them. This is another way they feel cared for and comforted.\" Melissa's Brigade hopes to provide more comfort care packages. \"If Melissa had won her battle against cancer, I believe she would have started this movement herself,\" says Schuler. \"We have a lot more comforting to do in Mercer County.\" RWJBarnabas Health and Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital Hamilton, in partnership with Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey\u2014the state's only NCI-Designated Comprehensive Cancer Center\u2014provide close-to-home access to the most advanced treatment options.

Healthy Together | 20 | Spring 2021 Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital Hamilton | RWJBH.ORG/HAMILTON | 21 Healthy Together | 20 | Spring 2021 RWJUHH_SportsMed_Spr21_Final.indd 20 3/16/21 3:11 PMHOW A YOUNG PERFORMER REBOUNDED FROM A SERIOUS KNEE INJURY. It was 48 hours before the opening night of her high school musical, Broadway's \"Newsies,\" and Kelsey Fischer, dance captain of the show, was performing a high-energy jazz number during rehearsal. Suddenly, she felt and heard an ominous pop in her right knee. \"I couldn't feel my knee,\" recalls Kelsey, 18, of the February 2020 incident. \"My leg felt paralyzed, from my hip to my ankle. I had to get off the stage, out of the lights and disconnect from the sound system so no one could hear me cry.\" Kelsey's parents took her straight to the Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital (RWJUH) Hamilton Emergency Department, where X-rays were taken. It turns out she had torn her anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), a structure that stabilizes the knee. She was fitted with a knee brace to stabilize the joint. It would take two weeks for severe swelling\u2014a common side effect of ACL tears\u2014to sufficiently subside for an MRI scan to confirm the diagnosis. A WELCOME COMPROMISE While Kelsey could walk, albeit with a limp, her ability to dance would be jeopardized unless she had ACL reconstruction surgery, says Michael R. Duch, MD, the RWJUH Hamilton orthopedic surgeon who treated her. But Kelsey wanted to put off the procedure until after she'd participated in three milestones\u2014 prom, graduation and her senior dance recital. With her parents' blessing, the two struck a compromise: Kelsey could hold off on surgery as long as she continued to wear a knee brace over the next few months. Dr. Duch performs between 20 and 40 ACL reconstructions each year and treats patients of all ages. He knew Kelsey could get by with a knee brace in the short term. \"I was comfortable with Kelsey's decision,\" he says. Kelsey was grateful. \"Dr. Duch was really understanding,\" she recalls. \"He always called me a rock star. He reassured me that my knee would go back to normal, like nothing had ever happened.\" TIME FOR HEALING For Kelsey, there was a silver lining to the COVID-19 pandemic. Since school and dance classes were held virtually, she had the opportunity to concentrate on healing. It also meant that she could have surgery sooner, since her long-awaited milestone events were cancelled. In a 35-minute, same-day procedure last June, Dr. Duch performed the surgery. Six months of physical therapy followed. Kelsey walked on a treadmill, rode a stationary bike and did weight and resistance training to restore her range of motion and strengthen the muscles surrounding her knee. She completed therapy in December 2020. Both surgeon and patient are thrilled with Kelsey's recovery. \"She can go back to doing whatever she wants,\" says Dr. Duch. Now a freshman majoring in psychology at The College of New Jersey (TCNJ), Kelsey spent the fall semester learning virtually. She's eager to try out for TCNJ's dance group when in-person auditions are held. \"This experience has given me a greater understanding of the human body,\" she says. \"If I don't feel well, I don't try to power through like I used to. I understand this is my body's way of telling me to slow down.\"BACK TO THE DANCE FLOOR Learn more about The Orthopedic & Spine Institute at RWJUH Hamilton and schedule your consultation.

A common disorder is sleep apnea, in which a person temporarily stops breathing many times during the night due to an airway blockage. A CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure) machine increases air pressure in your throat so your airway doesn't collapse while you're sleeping. It's the gold standard treatment for sleep apnea, but there are alternatives, says Dr. Frank. Here are several ways to cope with the condition: MANDIBULAR ADVANCEMENT DEVICE Oral appliance therapy can help prevent the tongue from flopping backward and obstructing the airway. A dentist can create a mandibular advancement device, which covers the top and bottom teeth. Over the course of one to three months, the device moves the tongue and lower jaw forward while you sleep, which opens the airway and prevents snoring and sleep apnea. ADDRESSING STRUCTURAL PROBLEMS A thorough exam of the nose, back of the nose and throat can help identify structural factors that may contribute to snoring or sleep apnea, says Dr. Frank. These include a deviated septum, large tonsils and nasal polyps. Treating these problems can help reduce the severity of sleep apnea, points out Dr. Frank. WEIGHT LOSS \"Weight loss is important,\" says Dr. Frank. \"Fat pushes against the sides of the throat and narrows the airway. Also, abdominal fat pushes against the diaphragm, the only muscle that supports breathing during REM sleep.\" Studies show that obese people experience severe drops in oxygen levels during REM sleep, explains Dr. Frank. If you lose weight, the airway will open more and the diaphragm will work better. \"A 10 percent weight loss can reduce sleep disturbances by 50 percent,\" says Dr. Frank. For some, bariatric surgery is a good solution. INSPIRE You might have seen the TV commercials for Inspire, a pacemaker-like device for people with sleep apnea. This device is implanted under the skin near the top of the chest. A sensor detects when the tongue is too relaxed and sends an electrical charge to it, preventing it from obstructing the airway. This device also helps to restore tone in the muscle of the tongue, says Dr. Frank. A \"sleep endoscopy,\" in which an ear, nose and throat specialist examines the back of the throat, can determine whether you're a good candidate for Inspire. Start to sleep better!

For more information, call 609.584.6550 or visit www.rwjbh.org/hamiltonpfac . Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital (RWJUH) Hamilton's goal is to deliver safe, comprehensive and compassionate healthcare. To do this, the hospital needs feedback from the community. So, in 2016, RWJUH Hamilton formed a Patient and Family Advisory Council (PFAC). \"We want to keep patients and family members connected with the hospital, informed and respected,\" says Jill S. Anderson, MBA, MBB, PMP, Vice President, Patient Experience, RWJBarnabas Health. At RWJUH Hamilton, six PFAC members meet monthly for one hour. All are active volunteers at the hospital and have been patients or have family members who have been patients in the past two years. \"We embrace their input,\" says Anderson. \"They provide feedback based on their experiences.\" Hospital employees approach PFAC members with specific concerns and ask for their recommendations. For instance, the director of ambulatory surgery attended a PFAC meeting and asked the group for their recommendations on how to get patients to fill out surveys. Sometimes, PFAC members approach the hospital with their own concerns. For instance, one person said, \"I noticed there's no visible sign to the elevator,\" so a sign was added. Members also pointed out that it was difficult to read the communication boards in patient rooms, so the font was enlarged. Listening and applying recommendations from the voices of our patients and families improve the quality of care and patient experience. SERVING ON COMMITTEES In 2018, all RWJBarnabas Health hospitals instituted their own PFACs. Across the system, members participate in patient rounds, during which they visit hospitalized patients, and provide feedback on patient education. They also serve on quality and safety committees, including Bioethics, Quality, Infection Control, Patient Falls, Safety, Pediatric and Palliative Care. Some PFAC members have joined the LGBTQ Business Group andHand Hygiene Task Force. Last year, PFAC members started to participate in biweekly calls with Epic, the system's new Electronic Health Record vendor. They have been providing input into the marketing plan for MyChart, the new patient portal. Looking ahead, specialty PFAC groups may form to serve Spanish-speaking patients, Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey and NICUs. PFAC members appreciate the fact that their voices are heard. Says one member: \"Prior to this, I would send back the patient survey and never know if my comments were addressed. Now I know the hospital administration and PFAC members are...working on issues that affect all of us. I am forever grateful for the opportunity to be a member.\"The impact of the RWJUH Hamilton Patient and Family Advisory Council can be seen throughout the hospital.
