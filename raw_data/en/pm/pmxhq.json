To that end, I am grateful for the support of all those who helped me conceptually, methodologically, analytica lly, financially, and emotionally over the last nine months. I would like to thank my dissertation committee ch air and advisor, Michael Fagen, for his guidance and encouragement, his willingness to indulge my aggressive and somewhat overly ambitious timelines, and his abilit y to read my stress level and diffuse it with sound advice and just the right amount of s arcasm and humor. I would also like to thank the other members of my dissertation committe e who have not only been invaluable in helping me think through quandaries a nd offering insightful feedback, but who have been a genuinely wonderful group of people to work with throughout this process. Many thanks also go to Anne Buffington for not onl y being \"the back up to my back up\" digital voice recorder but an amazingly ob servant and insightful notetaker during all 12 of my focus groups. They would not ha ve been nearly as fun or successful without her generous support. I also have to thank Leona Quist, my dedicated and enthusiastic research assistant, for her help in th e coding process. Although I am prone to hyperbole, it's not oversta ting it when I say that I literally could not have done this research without the help of my focus-group participants, all of iii ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS (continued) whom offered insightful and often brilliant contrib utions to my work. And while I feel certain that few, if any of them, will search the U IC library for this dissertation, I hope they know how much I appreciated their willingness to participate, their generosity, and their thoughtfulness. I also hope they approve of t he pseudonyms I have given them. I am also grateful and humbled to have received se veral awards to support my time and this work financially: the UIC Dean's Sch olar Award, the UIC Chancellor's Award, and the New York Community Trust's Fahs-Beck Dissertation Grant. Last but certainly not least, I would like to than k my family and friends for their incredible support and their (at times potentially feigned) interest in my research. None of this would have been possible without my amazing husband Andy who has been my thought partner, emotional supporter, and cheerlead er throughout this process and my daughter Audrey whose smiles and hugs have filled m e with joy and helped me rebound from some particularly long days sitting at my comp uter.

Although most cases cle ar on their own, some strains of HPV can develop into a more serious infection. While th ere is no cure for HPV, two vaccines have been approved to prevent the strains of HPV th at cause more than 70% of cervical cancer and 90% of genital warts. Both males and fem ales ages 9 -26 are eligible for the vaccine. Shortly after becoming available, both vac cines were marketed to the public through television, magazine, and Internet ads and framed as cervical cancer prevention, largely avoiding discussion of the viru s itself in order to evade STI-related stigma and improve uptake of the vaccine. The purpo se of this research is to examine the influence of the media on parental and adolesce nt decisions to get the HPV vaccine. Many different, often competing factors play a rol e in an individual's decision to vaccinate oneself or one's child against a disease. In the United States most recommended routine immunizations are given to chil dren. The HPV vaccine, however, is a bit different as it is targeted at an age rang e that extends across the spectrum of adolescence and into young adulthood. Therefore, un like most childhood vaccines where the parent is the primary decision-maker and legally responsible for granting consent, most of the HPV vaccine eligible populatio n (those ages 18-26) will make their own decisions about vaccine uptake. In addition, ad olescents under 18 years old, especially those ages 15-17 also likely have input into vaccine decision-making along with their parents. When considering vaccine uptake , decision-makers, both parents of xi SUMMARY (continued) eligibles and vaccine-eligibles themselves, can be influenced by a number of factors: policy recommendations at the federal, state, or lo cal level, healthcare providers, underlying personal beliefs, and various external f actors. Of the external factors, media may be the most important among the HPV vaccine-eli gible population because of the amount they consume on a daily basis. Media coverage includes both media exposure and me ssage framing. Media exposure is simply whether or not someone has viewe d content and how much. Message framing refers to how content is presented in the media. While message framing has a distal effect on vaccine decision-mak ing, it may serve to influence underlying adolescent or parental beliefs that have been shown to predict vaccine decision-making: (1) perceived susceptibility, (2) perceived barriers, (3) perceived severity, (4) perceived norms, and (5) self-efficac y. These beliefs have been shown to have a proximal effect on HPV vaccine et al., 2010); therefore, if media can influence one's underlying beliefs, then in turn, it may have an ef fect on behavioral intention, the behavior itself, or both. This study examines the r elationship between message framing and these underlying beliefs. Shortly after approval by the Food and Drug Admini stration (FDA), both vaccine makers, Merck and GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), launched a dvertising campaigns to market their products. In the last few years, advertising has become a considerable source of information about the HPV vaccine among vaccine-eli gibles and xii SUMMARY (continued) their parents; therefore, exploring the content of the ads, as well as what information the audience derives from them, is decidedly important. The purpose of this research was to explore the relationship between message framing in the media and HPV vaccine decision-making behavior. This study examined how p harmaceutical ads influence parental and adolescent beliefs about HPV and the H PV vaccine through two research questions: (1) how have the direct-to-consumer ads framed the HPV vaccine? and (2) how does this framing influence vaccine decision-ma kers? These questions were answered through discourse analysis and focus group s. Discourse analysis was used to understand how the ads were framed and how this fra ming reflects and shapes social norms about HPV and the HPV vaccine. Focus groups w ere used to capture vaccine decision-maker reactions to eight direct-to-consume r HPV vaccine ads. Pre- and post- surveys were also used within the focus-group sessi ons to measure knowledge change as a result of watching the ads. Research findings are presented in a series of three manuscripts: the first paper focuses on the overarc hing themes generated through discourse analysis; the second examines vaccine dec ision-makers' knowledge change before and after watching the vaccine ads; and the third maps underlying belief constructs to the themes from the discourse analysi s and focus groups. 1 I. INTRODUCTION Several prominent health behavior theories suggest that media coverage is one of many external factors that has a distal influenc e on behavior. Colloquially, media coverage refers to whether or not an issue is featu red on television, radio, film, or the Internet; or in newspapers, magazines, music, or ot her forms of communication. However, for the purposes of examining media's role in influencing health behavior, how the issue is framed , not if it is covered, is most important. For example, simp ly discussing the link between a heart attack and smok ing in the media is not enough to influence behavior; media coverage would have to ma ke the issue salient to a certain audience and recommend a solution. Portraying heart attacks as common among male smokers of a certain age may prime viewers who fit that description to think they are at higher risk and potentially undertake the proposed solution. Personal underlying beliefs mediate the relationsh ip between message framing and health behavior. While this may seem simple, th e nature of the health behavior often complicates it. For example, while most peopl e can agree that preventing serious illness is important, there is significant debate a bout how to do it. Vaccines have proven controversial since they were first introduced in t he 1800s (Sturm et al., 2005). While they have a long track record of preventing and oft en eliminating disease from the population, vaccines are still met with skepticism and doubt in the United States. Therefore, if the health behavior in question is va ccine uptake, message framing may need to be carefully considered. When the media cov erage focuses on a vaccine that 2 protects against a stigmatized condition like an ST I, the issue gets even more complicated. Such is the case with the HPV vaccine. Currently, HPV is the most common STI in the Unite d States. Although most cases clear on their own persistent HPV can develop into a more serious infection. The virus is most commonly associated with cervical can cer though there is evidence that it can cause cancer at multiple sites or present as ge nital warts. There is no cure for HPV. However, two vaccines, Merck's Gardasil and GlaxoSm ithKline's Cervarix, have been approved to help prevent several strains of the inf ection. After licensure, both companies developed advertising campaigns to market their products. These ads can be seen on television (TV), in magazines, and on th e Internet. Some of the TV ads in particular have become controversial because of the way they frame the vaccine as preventing cervical cancer and largely avoid discus sing the virus itself, or how it spreads. This approach seems to have been used to e schew the inherent stigma associated with STIs and improve uptake of the vacc ine. The purpose of this research was to examine the influence of the media on parent al and adolescent beliefs about getting the HPV vaccine. More specifically, this re search was guided by the following overarching research questions and sub-questions: 1) How have the direct-to-consumer ads framed the H PV vaccine? What information is highlighted and made salient? What information is omitted and downplayed? To what extent do the ads target certain underlying beliefs about getting the HPV vaccine? 2) How does this framing influence vaccine decision -makers? 3 How does decision-maker knowledge change based on m essage framing? How does the message framing resonate with vaccine decision-makers? These research questions were examined through two methods: discourse analysis and focus groups. This study helps to expl ain media's distal influence on HPV vaccine uptake by exploring whether the message fra ming influences some underlying beliefs more than others and if its influence varie s depending on the decision-maker. Understanding media's influence is important for se veral reasons. First, it helps improve our understanding of how best to frame other STI va ccines in the pipeline to ensure maximum uptake. Second, it sheds light on what need s to be undone to improve male vaccine uptake. Third, it allows us to understand w hether the HPV vaccine should be framed differently to improve all future uptake. 4 II. BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE A. The Human Papillomavirus 1. Epidemiology The human papillomavirus is a family of more than 150 small DNA viruses that infect epithelial cells leaving its own geneti c material in the host cell's chromosomes. Of these, more than 40 strains are sex ually transmissible and easily spread through direct skin-to-skin contact during v aginal, anal, or oral sex. In fact, HPV is the most common STI in the United States: an est imated 79.1 million Americans are currently infected with HPV, with another 14.1 mill ion new cases each year. Of these new infections, almost half occured among those age d 15-24 years old (Satterwhite et al., 2013). Because HPV is not a notifiable disease , prevalence and incidence data are primarily from clinic-based populations. A study co nducted by Dunne et al. (2007) of pre-vaccine HPV rates found that 26.8% of females a ges 14-59 (or 24.9 million people according to 2000 US Census numbers) tested positiv e for HPV DNA. Infection was highest among those ages 20-24 (44.8%) with an over all prevalence of 33.8% in 14-24 year olds. These data translate to 7.5 million fema les, higher than previous estimates of 4.6 million in this age group. This study also reve aled that HPV prevalence increased with each year of age from 14-24. The main risk fac tors associated with HPV infection appear to be young age at sexual debut and high num ber of sexual partners (Kim et al., 2011; Rotelli-Martin et al., 2011; National Cancer Institute [NCI], 2012). 5 2. Sequelae Although HPV is asymptomatic and typically clears on its own within two years of exposure, persistent infections can have m ore serious sequelae. Low-risk types of HPV can develop into genital warts while h igh-risk types can lead to cancer. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC ) (2012) estimates that 24,900 cases of HPV-associated cancers occur each year: 70 % in women and 30% in men. The virus causes nearly all cases of cervical cance r and almost all anal cancer (90%). It has also been linked to 65% of vaginal, 50% of vulv ar, and 35% of penile cancer (De Vuyst et al., 2009; Parkin and Bray, 2006). Recent studies also suggest that about 60% of oropharyngeal cancers are caused by HPV (Kreimer et al., 2005). Of these HPV- related cancers, cervical in women and oropharyngea l in men are the most common types with approximately 12,000 and 5,700 new cases diagnosed each year, respectively (CDC, 2012; NCI, 2012). At present, ce rvical cancer has the highest disease burden of the HPV-related cancers; however, estimates suggest that annual incidence of head and neck cancer will surpass cerv ical cancer rates by 2020 (Chaturvedi et al., 2011). Of the 15 high-risk types of HPV, two strains \u2014 HPV 16 and HPV 18 \u2014are the most oncogenic, causing 15,000 cases of cancer in w omen and 7,000 cases in men each year in the United States. These two strains c ause more than 70% of all cases of cervical cancer in the United States and close to h alf of all vaginal, vulvar, and penile cancers. HPV 16 is even more significant in anal ca ncer, causing nearly 85% of all cases. Beyond the anogenital cancers, HPV 16 alone is responsible for more than half of the cancers diagnosed in the oropharynx (NCI, 20 12; Chow et al., 2010; Watson et 6 al., 2008). Of the low-risk strains, HPV 6 and HPV 11 are responsible for roughly 90% of genital warts (CDC, 2012). Given HPV causes nearly all cervical cancer, it is important to briefly summarize patterns of incidence and mortality in the United S tates. As of 2007, 247,180 women were living with cervical cancer or had had a cervi cal cancer diagnosis but subsequently overcome the disease (SEER, 2010). Data from 2010, suggest that 12,200 women in the United States were diagnosed with cervical canc er (SEER, 2010). In the same year, 4,210 women died from the disease. Data collected b y SEER from 2003 -2007 suggest that Hispanic women had the highest incidence rate of cervical cancer (12 per 100,000), followed by Black women (10.1 per 100,000). These r ates are higher than other groups and significantly higher than the rate for all wome n in the United States (8.1 per 100,000). Mortality rates for women with cervical c ancer also vary by race/ethnicity but do not follow the pattern of incidence. Black women have the highest mortality rate at 4.4 per 100,000, almost double the rate of all wome n (2.4 per 100,000). This rate is also twice that of White women and Asian/Pacific Islande r women (2.2 and 2.1 respectively). With mortality rates of 3.4 per 100,000 for America n Indian/Alaska Natives and 3.1 per 100,000 for Hispanics, both groups have higher mort ality rates than all women. 3. Screening Screening for HPV is not typically conducted becaus e the virus is highly prevalent, often clears on its own, and cannot be t reated. Of the HPV-related diseases that can develop from a persistent infection, cervi cal cancer is the only one that is routinely screened for by clinicians in the United States. Pap tests help to detect 7 precancerous cells and cervical abnormalities that have developed as a result of a persistent HPV infection. The virus can be detected through a DNA test of the same type of cervical sample but can only tell a clinici an whether or not HPV is present and is not a screening for cervical cancer itself. Because of the ubiquity of HPV, the HPV DNA test is not recommended for women under 30 and is t ypically used in conjunction with the Pap test in women over 30 years old. There is n o routine screening recommended for other HPV-related cancers or genital warts. Thi s means that while both men and women can get HPV, there is no way to screen men fo r the infection. Although there is no treatment for HPV, there are two vaccines curren tly available that prevent the most prevalent strains of the infection. 4. Prevention: the vaccines Currently there are two highly efficacious vaccin es available for prevention of HPV. Because HPV is an STI, ideal administration for both vaccines is before sexual debut. The first approved vaccine was Merck's Garda sil, a quadrivalent vaccine (HPV4) that protects against two high-risk strains, 16 and 18, and two low-risk strains, 6 and 11. As previously noted these strains account for most cases of HPV-related cancer and nearly all genital warts. The HPV4 vaccine does not contain viral DNA and is not infectious. Clinical trials reveal that the vaccine is highly immunogenic, safe, and effective in both females and males ages 9 through 26. Data suggest that antibody responses are highest among those 9 to 15 years old . While studies examining the duration of the vaccine are still ongoing, it is th ought to last for at least 5 years (Brady et 8 al., 2012; CDC, 2007). The vaccine is administered by intramuscular injection as a three-dose series given with in a 6 month period at 0, 2, and 6 months. In 2006, Gardasil was licensed for use in females ages 9 -26 for the prevention of cervical cancer, genital warts, and certain precanc erous and dysplastic lesions including cervical adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS), intraepithel ial neoplasia grade 2 and 3 in the cervix (CIN), vulva (VIN), and vagina (VaIN), and C IN grade 1 (FDA, 2006). In September 2008, the license was extended for preven tion of vaginal and vulvar cancer (FDA, 2009). The following year, in October 2009, G ardasil was approved for use in boys and men ages 9 through 26 for the prevention o f genital warts. Most recently it was approved for prevention of anal cancer in Decem ber 2010 (FDA, 2010). It is not currently licensed to prevent non-anogenital cancer s such as those that affect the head and neck. Gardasil is highly efficacious and protec ts against 98% of CIN grade 2 or 3 and AIS and 100% of vaginal and vulvar cancer. It i s also 99% effective against genital warts caused by HPV 6 and HPV 11 (CDC, 2007). In October 2009, a second HPV vaccine was approved by the FDA. GlaxoSmithKline's (GSK) Cervarix is a bivalent vacc ine (HPV2) that protects against high-risk strains HPV 16 and HPV 18. It does not in clude the two low-risk strains 6 and 11 that cause 90% of genital warts. Like the quadri valent vaccine, Cervarix is also highly immunogenic, safe, and well tolerated in fem ales ages 9 through 26 with antibody responses highest in girls 9 -15 years old. Initially, this vaccine was only appr oved for females ages 10 -25 for the prevention of cervical cancer, CIN grade 1 and 2, and AIS (FDA, 2009). In July 2011, Cervarix was approved fo r use in females as young as 9 years old (FDA Approval letter, 2011). Efficacy of Cervarix against CIN grade 2 and 3 9 and AIS was 93% in females ages 15 through 25 years . Protection against HPV strains not included in the vaccine (but closely related to HPV 16 and HPV 18) was also elevated and found to be 37% (CDC, 2010). Both vaccines have been recommended by the CDC's A dvisory Committee on Immunization Practice (ACIP) for routine use in spe cific populations. Figure 1 shows the evolution of ACIP recommendations in the United Sta tes. Gardasil is recommended for both females and males ages 11 to 12, in order to v accinate before sexual debut, as part of the adolescent immunization platform, but c an be started as early as 9 years old per physician discretion. In addition, ACIP recomme nds that females 13 to 26 and males ages 13 to 21 who have not been immunized pre viously, or who have not received all 3 doses, complete the vaccine series. Men ages 22 to 26 may receive the vaccine but ACIP did not find a recommendation for this group to be cost effective (CDC, 2011). Routine use of Cervarix in girls ages 11 -12 and as a catch-up vaccination for females ages 13 -26 is also recommended by ACIP (CDC, 2010). Receivi ng an ACIP recommendation is important in terms of vaccine fin ancing. The vaccines are expensive compared to other vaccines ($130/dose or $390 for t he complete series) and are available through private physicians as well as pub lic clinics. 10 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 June October October Quadrivalent \u2014Routine, females 11 or 12 aand 13-26 year olds who have not been previously vaccinated Quadrivalentor Bivalent \u2014 Routine, females 11 or 12 aand 13- 26 year olds who have not been previously vaccinated Quadrivalent \u2014Routine, males 11 or 12 aand 13-21 year olds who have not been previously vaccinated May be given, males 22-26 bQuadrivalent \u2014May be given, males 9-26 Figure 1 .

Bivalent (HPV 16 and 18) includes Cervarix. a Can be given starting at 9 years old per physician discretion. b For MSM and immunocompromised males, recommended t hrough age 26. Adapted from Cullen (2012). 11 Vaccines are considered one of the single greatest achievements in public health. They have the potential to protect both vac cinated and unvaccinated persons alike. However, in order for a vaccine to protect a n entire population, enough people within that population must have immunity to the va ccine preventable disease (VPD). When a critical proportion of a population is vacci nated against a certain infectious disease it lowers the risk of infection for the pop ulation as whole, including those who have not been vaccinated. This is known as herd imm unity. For the HPV vaccine, the rate of vaccination needs to be about 80% -85% for herd immunity to work. Therefore, increasing the uptake of any vaccine is important i n protecting populations against VPDs. While Gardasil and Cervarix are a huge step f orward in HPV prevention (and by extension site-specific cancer and genital wart pre vention), the uptake for the HPV vaccine has not \"demonstrated the same strong and s teady increases over time like the increases . . . seen following the introduction of other vaccines\" (CDC, 2010). In 2011, for the third year in a row, the increase in HPV va ccine coverage is half of that shown for other vaccines among 13 -17 year olds, including tetanus-diptheria-pertussis and meningococcal conjugate vaccine (CDC, 2012). Intere stingly, missed-opportunity data from the same survey show that if the HPV vaccine w as given every time the dTap and MCV4 shots were given that coverage would be about 80%, right around the herd immunity level. According to the 2011 National Immunization Survey (NIS) data, rates were lower among younger girls, indicating that females are not getting vaccinated at the recommended age of 11 or 12 years old. Among 11 -12 year olds, only 15% had received at least one dose in 2010, 10% had receive d two doses, and a mere 6% had 12 received all three doses. Data from 2011 show that 53% of 13 -17-year-old females had received one dose and 35% had completed the series and gotten all three doses (CDC, 2012). These data also show some interesting demogr aphic trends in regards to series completion. While a higher percentage of Hispanic a nd Black females received the first dose of the vaccine, far fewer received all three d oses. As the efficacy of the vaccine is highest after all three doses, getting the full ser ies is important, especially among groups who already have the highest incidence and m ortality rates of cervical cancer. Whites were more likely than Hispanics or Blacks to receive all 3 doses of the vaccine. Data from 2011 show that for females, 43% of 19 -21 year olds and 21.5% of 22 - 26 years old had received at least 1 dose of the HP V vaccine. Rates of vaccination among 19 -26 year old females increased steadily from 2009-20 11 but are still low. The largest increase was reported among women aged 19-2 1 years (14.9%) which may reflect healthcare-provider influence and social no rms about HPV vaccination (CDC, 2013). Male uptake is considerably lower than female uptak e, with only 8% of eligibles having received one dose. Only 1% of males had rece ived all 3 doses. While these rates are still very low, it is an increase from 20 10 when rates of uptake of 1 dose hovered around 1% (CDC, 2012). Males 19 -26 also had low rates of uptake in 2011: only 2.8% of males 19 -21 and 1.7% of males 22 -26 had received at least 1 dose of the HPV vaccine (CDC, 2013). Male rates are expected to be lower than female rates because this group was more recently approved to re ceive the vaccine. Understanding HPV vaccine decision-making may help to improve int erventions and approaches to increasing vaccine uptake. 13 B. A Conceptual Model of Vaccine Decision-Making Improving HPV vaccine uptake rates requires an und erstanding of vaccine decision-making. Many different, often competing fa ctors play a role in an individual's decision to vaccinate against a disease. While this study focuses on the influence of media on adolescent and parental decisions to get t he HPV vaccine, it is important to examine the broader landscape in which the decision is made. In the United States most recommended routine immunizations are given to infants and young children. The HPV vaccine, however, is a bit different as it is r ecommended for an age range that extends across the spectrum of adolescence and into young adulthood. Therefore, unlike most childhood vaccines where the parent is the sole decision-maker, most of the HPV vaccine-eligible population (those ages 18 -26) will make their own decisions about vaccine uptake. This is important because conceptua lizing the inputs into vaccine decision-making behavior must account for both pare ntal and personal underlying beliefs. When considering vaccine uptake, decision- makers, both parents of eligibles and vaccine-eligibles themselves, can be influenced by a number of factors: policy recommendations at the federal, state, or local lev el; healthcare providers; underlying beliefs; and a number of external factors. Adapted from Sturm, et al. (2005), Figure 2 frames this discussion by illustrating how these va rious components relate to each other and ultimately influence HPV vaccine decision-makin g. 14 Underlying Personal or Parental Beliefs Perceived Susceptibility Perceived Barriers Perceived Severity Perceived Norms Self-efficacy Policy Recommendations CDC/ACIPrecommendation National-level policy mandates State-level policy mandates School-entry vaccination requirements Professional organization recommendation External Factors Demographics Stigma about sexually transmitted infections (STI) Media Coverage (exposure and message framing) Cultural attitudes about vaccines Cultural attitudes about sex Intention to Vaccinate Vaccine Uptake Vaccine Decision-Making See Figure 3 Healthcare Provider Health provider attitude Vaccine recommendation Access to provider Availability of vaccine Figure 2: Conceptual Model of HPV Vaccine Decision-Making. Adapted from Sturm et al., 2005. 15 1. Policy recommendations Policy recommendations work in a truly top-down fas hion, as illustrated by their placement in Figure 2. They influence both he althcare providers and decision- makers' underlying beliefs. The policy recommendati on process starts immediately after FDA approval when it is reviewed by the ACIP. Appoi nted by the US Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), ACIP is comprised of 14 experts on vaccinology, immunology, pediatrics, internal medic ine, nursing, family practice medicine, virology, public health, infectious disea se, and preventive medicine, as well as one consumer representative. Eight ex-officio me mbers and 30 non-voting members also attend the thrice-annual meeting of the commit tee at CDC. Members of ACIP cannot have links to vaccine makers while serving o n the committee. Charged with providing advice on vaccine practice to the CDC, AC IP develops written recommendations for routine administration of vacci nes to children and adults in the civilian population. Each recommendation includes: age of vaccine receipt, number of doses, time between doses, precautions, and contrai ndications. While the recommendations come from ACIP, CDC ultimately sets the schedule of vaccination and has the final say; ACIP votes and passes \"provi sional\" recommendations but they do not become official until they are approved by t he director of the CDC and published in the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR) . The CDC/ACIP recommendation then trickles down to other parts of government and influential professional organizations. An ACIP recommendation is important in terms of va ccine financing and access. All vaccines that have received an ACIP recommendat ion for routine use are covered 16 under the federal Vaccines for Children (VCF) progr am which is funded by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and admini stered through the CDC. The program provides free vaccines to anyone under the age of 18 who is Medicaid eligible, uninsured, underinsured, or an American Indian/Nati ve Alaskan (CDC, 2011). Vaccines are bought by the CDC at discounted rates and suppl ied to state and local health departments who provide them to private doctors and public clinics registered as VCF providers. Although not currently mandated to do so , health insurance plans are more likely to cover vaccines that are recommended by AC IP as well (Shen et al., 2009). The Affordable Care Act requires new group and individu al plans to cover all ACIP recommended vaccines one year after the recommendat ion without cost-sharing requirements (HHS, 2012). Vaccines that receive a recommendation by ACIP may also be more likely to have state-level legislation behind it. For example , after Gardasil received ACIP recommendation in 2006, 41 states and the District of Columbia introduced legislation to require the vaccine, fund its use, or educate the p ublic about it. While only half were actually enacted, greater attention was focused on the vaccine after its ACIP recommendation. In 2007, the governor of Texas trie d and failed to enact an executive order to require all sixth-grade girls entering sch ool to receive the vaccine. The increased attention by state legislatures could aff ect an individual's underlying beliefs about the importance of the vaccine (National Confe rence of State Legislators [NCSL], 2012). Beyond raising awareness of the vaccine, two legislatures actually passed school vaccine mandates. Virginia and the District of Columbia both have laws requiring the HPV vaccine for school entry. 17 Finally, national professional organizations like the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), American Academy of Family Physic ians, American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology, and American Medical Ass ociation work with ACIP as non- voting liaison representatives who bring additional expertise to committee meetings. These organizations typically endorse ACIP recommen dations once they are published. This is important on two levels. Patients and healt hcare consumers often do their own research on vaccines and other health issues and lo ok to these organizations to guide their health decisions. Second, healthcare provider s are members of these professional organizations. If, for example, AAP recommends all males and females 11 -26 get the HPV vaccine, pediatricians will be more likely to s tock it and discuss it with their patients, which is a significant factor in vaccine decision-making. 2. Healthcare providers Within the main conceptual model, healthcare provid ers are guided by policy recommendations but they also directly influ ence the underlying beliefs of the decision-maker. In the case of the HPV vaccine, who the decision-maker is depends on age: for those under 18 it will be a parent or guar dian and for those 18 -26 it will be the vaccine-eligibles themselves. Both types of decisio n-makers seem to be strongly influenced by their healthcare providers, particula rly regarding newly developed vaccines. In their review of the vaccine literature , Sturm et al. (2005) found that the best predictor of parental acceptance was healthcare-pro vider attitude about and recommendation for a particular vaccine. More recen t studies examining the HPV vaccine suggest the same thing: physician recommend ation is a strong predictor of 18 vaccine uptake. Gerend et al. (2009) found that par ents with vaccinated daughters were more likely to have received a recommendation about the vaccine from their healthcare providers, underscoring the importance of physician advice. Similarly, Reiter et al. (2009) found that parents who received a recommenda tion by their physician had stronger intentions to vaccinate. When examining young adults as the decision-makers , Rosenthal et al. (2011) found that women 19 -26 were \"overwhelmingly\" more likely to get the HPV vaccine if they discussed it with a physician. Further, the au thors found that women who received a \"strong\" recommendation by their healthcare provi der were four times more likely to get the HPV vaccine than those who received a recom mendation that was not perceived as \"strong.\" Gerend and Shepherd (2011) f ound that physician recommendation had a significant effect on several underlying beliefs of vaccine-eligible young women associated with uptake (self-efficacy a nd subjective norms) and intention (cost, benefits, and susceptibility). In addition, a national survey looking at early adoption and knowledge of the HPV vaccine found tha t discussion with a doctor or nurse was a strong predictor of vaccine uptake and that 77% of respondents identified healthcare providers as their most trusted source f or medical information (Caskey et al., 2009). 3. Underlying personal and parental beliefs In their original conceptual model of factors influ encing parental decision- making, Sturm et al. (2005) rely heavily on the Hea lth Belief Model (HBM) to explain the parental and personal beliefs that affect vaccinati on decisions. In Figure 2, some HBM 19 constructs remain (perceived susceptibility, percei ved barriers, perceived severity) but have been combined with one from the Theory of Plan ned Behavior (TPB) (self- efficacy) and one from the Integrated Behavioral Mo del (IBM) (perceived norms). Constructs from HBM, TPB, and IBM work well togethe r in a conceptual model because they have several commonalities: they all theorize health behavior at the individual level, are guided by value and expectancy beliefs, and assume that behavior is rational and deliberate (Gerend and Shepherd, 2011; Glanz et al., 2008). These key similarities make intuitive sense when applied to HPV vaccine be havior as illustrated in Figure 2. A main difference between HBM, TPB, and IBM is that t he latter two health theories posit that behavioral intention, not the underlying belie fs themselves, are the best predictor of behavior. Figure 2 shows intention to vaccinate as an immediate antecedent of vaccine uptake. Most studies examining HPV vaccine behavior have f ocused on vaccine acceptability \u2014willingness to vaccinate oneself or one's child. A review of these studies found a significant relationship between acceptabil ity and most HBM constructs including perceived susceptibility, perceived benef its, perceived barriers, and physician recommendation as a cue to action (Brewer and Fazek as, 2007). A few studies have examined predictors of HPV vaccine uptake and found that subjective norms, perceived barriers, perceived susceptibility, and a physician 's cue to action are associated with HPV vaccine uptake (Brewer et al., 2011; Rosenthal et al., 2011; Reiter et al., 2009; Allen et al., 2009). A recent study by Gerend and S hepherd (2011) tested and compared both HBM and TPB to see which was a better fit in accurately predicting behavior. They also tested a combined model. Result s from this study suggest TPB 20 outperformed HBM in overall goodness of fit. Howeve r, the combined model suggested that five constructs, three from HBM (perceived sus ceptibility, safety concerns, and perceived severity) and two from TPB (subjective no rms and self-efficacy) predict HPV vaccine intention. This study also found that inten tion to vaccinate was the strongest predictor of HPV vaccine uptake. Some of the findin gs from the Gerend and Shepherd (2011) study are reflected in the Figure 2 model. As discussed in the previous two sections, underly ing personal and parental beliefs are influenced by healthcare provider recom mendation and attitudes about the HPV vaccine and the larger policy recommendations b oth directly and indirectly. These underlying beliefs are also influenced by external factors as described in the next section. As shown in Figure 2, underlying personal and parental beliefs are the central components in the model: they filter most of the ot her influences and are the only constructs that have a proximal effect on vaccine d ecision-making as a whole and intention to vaccinate in particular. A more detail ed illustration of the HBM, TPB, and IBM constructs included in this model, their relati onship to other constructs, and predictability of HPV vaccine decision-making can b e found in Figure 3 and are discussed elsewhere in this paper. 4. External factors Finally, there are a host of external factors that likely have a proximal effect on underlying beliefs and thus a distal effe ct on health behavior. While the list of external factors invariably changes depending upon the health behavior in question, in the case of HPV vaccine uptake, it likely includes, at a minimum, demographics, stigma 21 about STIs, media coverage of the vaccine, cultural attitudes about vaccines, and attitudes about sex. Demographics have an effect on many different types of health behavior, and vaccination is no exception. For exam ple, low socioeconomic status (SES) is often associated with limited access to he althcare. An individual may face any number of issues when seeking healthcare: they may not have a primary care provider; they may lack health insurance and/or be otherwise unable to pay; they could have limited means of transportation. These SES-related difficulties could influence underlying beliefs around perceived barriers which in turn could have an effect on vaccine decision-making. Specific to the HPV vaccine, an individual's views on STIs are likely to affect decision-making as well. If a decision-maker attach es a high level of stigma to STIs, this could affect their underlying beliefs about getting the HPV vaccine. In particular, this is likely to affect an individual's perceived suscepti bility. If they think that only certain types of people get STIs and they do not see themselves a s that type of person then they may believe they are at low risk despite what level of susceptibility their actual behavior may imply. This belief may in turn lead them to go unva ccinated. Theoretically, stigma can also work to encourage vaccine uptake. If an indivi dual believes that getting an STI carries a high level of stigma, then not getting the HPV vaccine could result in a social sanction. In this example, stigma has an effect on one's perceived norms (or their belief about what ought to be done and what others like th em are doing) and thus may lead to vaccine uptake. Stigma's relationship to underlying personal and parental beliefs is very complex and likely both positive and negative. 22 Media coverage of vaccines may also influence unde rlying personal and parental beliefs. The direction of association is likely bas ed on how messages are framed in the media. The proximal relationship between media cove rage and underlying beliefs as well as the distal relationship between media and v accine decision-making are the focus of this paper and discussed in-depth in the next se ction. Attitudes, both about vaccines and sexual activity , may have an influence on underlying beliefs and thus vaccine decision-making . Some individuals \u2014and even larger segments of society \u2014are dubious of vaccines for any number of reasons, from religious beliefs about medical intervention to the theories about the number of vaccines given in childhood to ideas about vaccines causing other conditions as a side effect. Regardless of the specific concern, these anti-vacc ine attitudes have strong influence on personal and parental beliefs. While this holds for all immunizations, attitudes about sex are more specific to the HPV vaccine. Because t he HPV vaccine prevents an STI, cultural attitudes about sex will likely influence a parent's belief about their child's susceptibility. For example, parents who do not wan t to think about their child becoming sexually active in the future may not deem the vacc ine necessary based on perceived risk. Similarly, cultural attitudes about sex can a lso influence adolescent beliefs about their own susceptibility: those guided by religious or personal values about only having one lifetime partner or waiting until marriage to h ave sex may not consider themselves at risk for an STI. 23 C. Media Coverage as a Key External Factor This paper argues that media coverage is a key ext ernal factor that influences underlying personal and parental beliefs about the HPV vaccine. Media coverage, or more precisely, message framing can be viewed (much like a physician recommendation) as a cue to action. Figure 3 illust rates the distal relationship between media coverage and vaccine uptake. Briefly, media c overage, which includes both media exposure and message framing, influences five specific underlying beliefs (perceived susceptibility, perceived barriers, perc eived severity, perceived norms, and self-efficacy) that have a proximal impact on vacci ne decision-making. Media coverage is the key external factor in this model because th e vaccine-eligible population consumes it at incredible rates. On average, adoles cents (ages 8 -18) spend more than 7.5 hours per day with media, whether it's TV, the Internet, music, print, or video games. Since youth often use more than one form of media a t a time (called \"media multitasking\") they actually view nearly 11 hours o f media content in that 7.5 hour time frame (Kaiser Family Foundation, 2010). Television is by far the most-used media with adolescents watching an average of 4.5 hours per da y. The total amount of media exposure per day has increased over a 10-year perio d: 7.5 hours in 1999, 8.5 hours in 2005, and 10 hours and 45 minutes in 2009. Of those ages 8 -18, 11 -14 years old, closely followed by 15 -18 year olds consumed the most media per day, 11 ho urs and 53 minutes and 11 hours and 23 minutes respectively . Another 2010 report suggests that in a typical day, youth spend 2 -3 hours watching TV: 2.8 hours for those 13 -17 and 2.3 hours for those 18 -24 (Harris Interactive, 2010). This study also sugg ests that youth spend a considerable amount of time online with dai ly consumption of the Internet 24 increasing with age. Youth ages 13 -17 and young adults ages 18 -24 spend 3.5 and 4.5 hours of their day online respectively. Roughly two -thirds of all those ages 13 -24 reported having used the internet to watch videos. 25 Underlying Personal or Parental Beliefs External Factor: Media Coverage Intention to Vaccinate Vaccine Uptake HPV Vaccine Decision-Making Perceived Barriers Perceived Susceptibility Perceived Norms Self-efficacy Message Framing Media Exposure Perceived Severity Figure 3 . Conceptual model of relationship between media cov erage and HPV vaccine uptake. Based on data and concepts from de Visser et al., 2 011, Gerend and Sheperd, 2011, and Bleakley et al., 2009 . 26 Media coverage can be thought of as two distinct co nstructs: media exposure and message framing. Media exposure is simply wheth er or not someone has viewed content and how much. The data about adolescent med ia use pertain to media exposure. If an adolescent watches television or li stens to the radio they are exposed to media. Message framing refers to how content is pre sented in the media. As Figure 3 illustrates, media exposure only has a relationship with message framing: one must be exposed to media in order to view a message frame. However, message framing serves to influence the main underlying adolescent or pare ntal beliefs that often predict vaccine decision-making: perceived susceptibility (the exte nt to which someone believes they are/their child is at risk for HPV); perceived barr iers (potential roadblocks that could prevent someone from getting the HPV vaccine includ ing access, cost, or beliefs about safety); perceived severity (how serious the conseq uences of not getting vaccinated could be); perceived norms (beliefs about what othe rs think they should and what others like them are doing capturing injunctive and descri ptive norms); and self-efficacy (the perceived ability to control the behavior and the o utcome). Framing theory suggests that the way in which info rmation is presented can influence how a person thinks about a particular is sue. Message frames provide a way for people to understand complicated issues by defi ning the problem, suggesting a cause, and recommending a solution. Framing involve s two main components: selection (highlighting what is important and what the audien ce should pay attention to) and salience (making pieces of information noticeable, meaningful, or memorable to the audience). By selecting the right information and e levating an issue's salience, framing increases the probability that audiences will recei ve the information, discern its 27 meaning, and then process and store it in their mem ory (Entman, 1993). In addition, media frames often reflect the wider public discour se on certain issues and, if the frame is dominant enough, influence public opinion. Throu gh selection and salience, framing can also prime audiences to be more accepting of ce rtain ideas and perspectives (Kahneman and Tversky, 1984). The term \"framing\" is used fairly inconsistently i n the literature. However, two types of framing appear to be most relevant to heal th behavior: attribute framing and goal framing (Levin et al., 1998). Attribute framin g measures the basic process of evaluation between two choices by presenting a sing le attribute of an object, event, or behavior in a positive or negative way. In general, attributes are judged more favorably when framed in a positive way. However, if people h ave a strong personal involvement in the issue being framed (they know someone who ha d the vaccine and got HPV anyway) or if they have a moral belief attached to the issue (e.g., people should only have one lifetime partner therefore there is no nee d to get a vaccine to prevent an STI) they may be less susceptible to attribute framing e ffects. Goal framing is slightly different. It suggests th at the impact of the message depends on whether it stresses the positive consequ ences of performing an action or the negative consequences of not performing that sa me action. In general, framing studies have found that a negatively framed message , emphasizing losses, tends to have a greater impact on a given behavior than a co mparable positively framed message emphasizing the gains. The negative framing may be especially persuasive when actions are seen as being \"socially undesirabl e\" because the greatest perceived regret should be associated with suffering a loss a s a result of doing something that 28 goes against social norms. However, studies examini ng health behavior specifically suggest that gain-framed messages are more effectiv e for prevention behavior, like vaccinations, while loss-framed messages are better for disease detection behavior, like screenings (Rothman et al., 2006). This contradicti on is interesting in the present case as it suggests that both loss and gain framing of t he HPV vaccine may work depending on the target audience. Although there has been quite a bit of research ex amining what types of frames are most effective for different types of health be havior, few studies have examined what information should be included in these messag es and what underlying beliefs mediate the effects of message framing. Of the exis ting literature, data suggest that loss-framed messages increase perceived susceptibil ity of a disease (Gerend et al., 2008) as well as self-efficacy with regards to perf orming a health behavior (Meyerowitz and Chaiken, 1987). Additional research is needed t o further clarify the effects of message framing, specifically, the influence of gai n- and loss-framed messages on health behavior, not just attitudes and intentions (Gallagher and Updegraff, 2012). Figure 3 hypothesizes that message framing influen ces underlying adolescent and parental beliefs but does not specify what type of framing (loss versus gain) is most effective or what information should be included in these messages, both of which are beyond the scope of this research. The present stud y aims to explore the relationship between message framing and underlying beliefs abou t the HPV vaccine. Additionally, Figure 3 suggests that if message framing does infl uence beliefs, tapping into some may be more important than others. For example, of the beliefs shown to predict intention to vaccinate, which is often an immediate antecedent to vaccine behavior, only 29 perceived norms and self-efficacy are directly asso ciated with vaccine uptake. Therefore, identifying message frames that have the potential to increase self-efficacy or influence perceived norms may be most helpful in promoting vaccine uptake. D. Advertising the Vaccine Shortly after FDA approval, both Merck and GSK lau nched advertising campaigns to market their vaccines. In the last few years, advertising has become a considerable source of information for the HPV vacc ine. Various studies have found that youth as well as parent decision-makers have gotten a lot of information about the HPV vaccine from pharmaceutical ads. Exploring how pare nts learned about the HPV vaccine, Cates et al. (2010) found that pharmaceuti cal ads were the most-often cited information source (64% of respondents). Similarly, another study by Hughes et al. (2009) found 83% of parents/guardians had heard of the vaccine through drug company ads. Youth and young adults eligible for the vaccin e have also reported hearing about it through direct-to-consumer ads. Caskey et al. (2009 ) found that 66% of female respondents ages 13 -26 reported that Gardasil commercials were their pr imary source of information regarding the HPV vaccine. More rece ntly, Katz et al. (2011) reported that 59% of college males surveyed also cited commercial s as their primary source of information. Finally, another recent study found yo ung women ages 16 -20 reported TV ads as one of the best ways to encourage uptake of the vaccine (de Visser et al., 2011). As advertising seems to be one of the main sources that vaccine decision-makers use to get information about the HPV vaccine, exploring the content of the ads, as well as what information the audience derives from them, is decidedly important. 30 1. Vaccine framing studies Several pre-vaccine studies looking at vaccine acce ptance examined how best to frame the forthcoming HPV vacc ine. First, using goal-framing theory, Gerend and Shepard (2007) looked at the rel ative effectiveness of gain-versus loss-framed messages in promoting acceptance of the HPV vaccine. Consistent with goal-framing hypotheses, this study found that a lo ss-framed message, one describing the costs of not getting vaccinated, was more effec tive in terms of HPV vaccine acceptance than a gain-framed message, or one expla ining the benefits of vaccination. However, this difference was only significant among women who reported having engaged in risky sexual behavior and felt they were at higher risk of contracting HPV. These findings suggest that risky behavior is \"soci ally undesirable\" and that not getting vaccinated could lead to an outcome (like getting a n STI) that goes against social norms. Two other studies focused on how framing affects i ntention to vaccinate. Leader et al. (2009) compared message recall and vaccinati on intention of individuals based on how the HPV vaccine was described. In this study, t he authors found that women were most likely to report an intention to vaccinate whe n the vaccine was described as preventing cervical cancer only and available at li ttle or no cost. In addition, they found that well over 60% of respondents in each randomly assigned group were able to recall that the vaccine prevented cancer, while the majori ty of respondents failed to accurately remember whether they read information about STI pr evention or the potential risk of sexual promiscuity. These findings suggest that how the vaccine was framed as well as monetary cost may have an effect on vaccine intenti ons. 31 Similarly, Sperber et al. (2008) found that women from the rural South were more likely to vaccinate their daughters if the vaccine was framed as preventing cervical cancer. In this study, interest in the vaccine was high regardless of the frame as 80% of mothers suggested they would vaccinate their daught ers against cervical cancer, 76% against genital warts, and 70% against HPV. However , the difference in intention to vaccinate against cervical cancer and HPV was stati stically significant (p<.001) as was the difference between HPV and genital warts (p<.00 1) suggesting that framing the vaccine as preventing HPV may be least effective in terms of increasing uptake. The authors suggest that differences in the message-fra ming effect may be linked to perceived susceptibility of risk for each condition . Although not stated by the authors, it seems possible that perceived severity may also be at play here as cervical cancer and genital warts are sequelae of HPV. In addition beca use HPV is largely transient and always asymptomatic, it is likely seen as less seri ous than cervical cancer and genital warts. The notion that the HPV vaccine should be framed as preventing cancer was also bolstered by a 2007 CDC report. In this qualit ative study, Friedman and Shepeard looked at the best way to communicate about the HPV vaccine and found that the public commonly associates \"promiscuity,\" \"infidelity,\" \"s hame,\" \"guilt,\" and \"embarrassment\" with STIs. These findings suggest that because of S TI-related stigma, framing should highlight the vaccine's potential to prevent cancer , not HPV, in order to maximize uptake. While most of these studies have focused on messag e framing and vaccine acceptance or intention among women, there have rec ently been some studies focusing 32 on men. A 2010 study by McRee et al. suggested that men were more likely to report willingness to vaccinate if the vaccine was framed as preventing cancer. The authors cited perceived severity of disease as the main med iator between framing and willingness. A 2010 review of the literature found that when framed as protecting against cervical cancer and genital warts, HPV vaccine acce ptability was high in studies of male college students (74% -78%) but much lower in community samples (33%). Fur ther, messages about cervical cancer prevention in female partners did not resonate with males or parents of sons (Liddon et al., 2010). The se are interesting findings given the fairly recent recommendation of the HPV vaccine for males and the ubiquitous framing of the vaccine as an antidote to cervical cancer. 2. Stigma and the human papillomavirus Findings from the Friedman and Shepeard study are c onsistent with other research on HPV-related stigma. McCaffery et al. (2 006) examined the psychological and social impact of testing for oncogenic HPV. Sev eral themes emerged from interviews with women who tested positively for HPV , two of which are directly relevant to the notion of stigma. First, women used words li ke \"dirty,\" \"cheap,\" and \"nasty\" to describe how their positive test results made them feel (p. 171). These reactions suggest connotations of promiscuity as related to H PV's mode of transmission. Importantly, feelings of stigma and shame were not seen among women who were unaware that HPV is an STI. Second, because of the guilt and shame many women felt about their diagnosis, most reported that they felt significant anxiety about disclosing it to their partners and family and planned to discuss the possibility of cancer with their 33 loved ones and downplay or omit information about H PV or how they got it. This second theme suggests that discussing cancer is less stigm atizing than talking about (or having) an STI. A study by Perrin et al. (2006) also looked at wom en's emotional reactions to an HPV diagnosis. This study found that there was a co nsiderable amount of confusion around HPV in women who had positive test results. After clinicians gave them information about HPV's sexual transmission, emotio nal responses were found to be associated with stigma, fear, self-blame, powerless ness, and anger. Finally, Waller et al. (2007) examined the differences in women's expe cted responses to a positive HPV test using a quasi-experimental design study. These authors found that knowledge of how HPV is transmitted was significantly associated with stigma and shame, and that women respond similarly to HPV as they do to other STIs. This study also found that knowledge of HPV's high prevalence in the populatio n was associated with less intense feelings of stigma and shame, thus indicating that information about HPV's prevalence may have a \"normalizing effect\" that could lead to decreased stigma around the virus. Collectively, these studies support the notion that STIs, including HPV, are indeed stigma-laden and that marketing the HPV vaccine in a way that downplays HPV's sexually transmissible nature and highlights its ca ncer-prevention potential may maximize uptake. Despite what the controversy may suggest, the HPV vaccine is not the first immunization to prevent an STI. The first dose of v accine to prevent Hepatitis B is routinely administered to newborns before they even leave the hospital or within a few days of birth, with the second dose given at 1 -2 months old and the third between 6 and 34 18 months of age. Hepatitis B is spread through blo od and other body fluids and is considered an STI. Nevertheless, uptake of the Hepa titis B vaccine is considerably higher than that of the HPV vaccine. In 2010, full coverage was almost 92% among the recommended age group (children ages 19 -35 months), considerably higher than that of the HPV vaccine (CDC, 2011). The difference in u ptake could be due to the relative length of time each has been available or the fact that the Hepatitis B vaccine is given at the same time as many other childhood vaccines duri ng well-baby check ups. However, it must be noted that this vaccine may have seen hi gher uptake rates because Hepatitis B is not popularly thought of as an STI and most pe ople do not know how it is contracted. 3. Summary Research has shown that key decision-makers (eligib le youth and their parents) have gotten a lot of information about the HPV vaccine from TV ads, regardless of whether media is their preferred sour ce of information. Therefore, studying what information is being presented and how it is b eing framed is important in understanding what parents and young adults know ab out the HPV vaccine and the role message framing plays in vaccine decision-making. P re-vaccine framing studies suggest several things about framing the vaccine as preventing cervical cancer. First, this framing may increase vaccine intention by targ eting certain underlying beliefs such as perceived susceptibility, perceived costs, and s ubjective norms. Second, minimizing STI-related stigma is important for increased uptak e, perhaps especially for parents considering the vaccine for their 11 and 12 year ol ds. And finally, cervical cancer 35 prevention does not resonate with male vaccine-elig ibles, even as a way to protect their female partners. Collectively, these studies sugges t that message framing is important and that it may have an effect on parental and adol escent underlying beliefs in regards to uptake. Studying the HPV vaccine commercials the mselves will help partially explain media's distal influence on vaccine uptake. E. Exploring the Influence Most studies exploring message framing and the HPV vaccine have examined the effect of message framing on acceptability (Ger end et al., 2008; Gerend and Shepherd, 2007; Sperber et al., 2007) and intention to vaccinate (Lechuga et al., 2011; Bigman et al., 2010; Leader et. al., 2009). More re cently, a couple of studies have also looked at the effects of message framing on vaccine uptake (Gerend and Sheperd, 2011; Jurskova et al., 2011). A significant gap in the literature still exists, however. Future studies need to examine the effect of framin g on underlying beliefs that are shown to be significant predictors of uptake. The p resent study aims to help fill this gap by exploring the relationship between message frami ng and underlying beliefs. Examining what the HPV vaccine ads communicate and how the target audience interprets them improves our understanding of how m edia influences underlying beliefs about the HPV vaccine and provides a guide for how future communications can be framed to improve vaccine uptake and increase knowl edge about HPV. Improving vaccine uptake and knowledge about HPV is important because of the virus's causal relationship with cervical, anal, vaginal, vulvar, penile, and oropharyngeal cancers, as well as genital warts. In addition, because HPV is an STI, a better understanding of how 36 to effectively communicate about a stigmatized cond ition in the media may serve as a model for how to frame future STI vaccines as well as STI prevention more broadly. 37 III. METHODS The purpose of this research was to explore the re lationship between message framing in the media and HPV vaccine decision-makin g behavior. This study examined how pharmaceutical ads influence parental and adole scent beliefs about HPV and the HPV vaccine through two important research question s: (1) how have direct-to- consumer ads framed the HPV vaccine? and (2) how do es this framing influence vaccine decision-makers? These questions were broke n down into several sub- questions and answered by two different methods: di scourse analysis and focus groups. Table I illustrates the relationship between the re search questions, methods, and constructs as conceptualized in Figure 3. Table II defines these constructs more specifically. Adapted from Creswell's (2003) typology, this stud y uses a sequential transformative strategy: a two-phased approach in w hich data are collected in two distinct phases and integrated at the interpretatio n stage. Using two different qualitative methods, this study examines eight direct-to-consum er HPV vaccine ads. First, discourse analysis was used to examine how the ads frame the HPV vaccine and to what extent this framing both reflects and influenc es prevailing attitudes about sexual health. Using the conceptual model as the lens thro ugh which to view the commercials, the discourse analysis also explored which underlyi ng beliefs are targeted in the ads. Next, the same eight ads were shown to focus groups of vaccine decision-makers (males and females ages 15 -26 and parents of youth ages 11 -17) to explore their reactions to the content as well as how their knowl edge of HPV and the HPV vaccine 38 changed as a result of watching the ads. The focus- group activities included a pre- survey and a post-survey as well as a group discuss ion. Table II crosswalks the constructs from Figure 3 with the individual data c ollection methods used in this research. The following section explains the discou rse analysis and focus-group activities in more detail. 39 TABLE I METHODS CROSSWALK Main Research Question Sub-Research Question Data Collection Method Constructs Discourse Analysis Focus Group How have the direct-to-consumer ads framed the HPV vaccine?

Discourse Analysis Discourse is a form of social practice. It includes \"spoken or written language use\" as well as \"other types of semiotic activity ( i.e., activity that produces meanings), such as visual images (photography, video, diagrams ) and non-verbal communication (e.g., gestures)\" (Fairclough, 2000, 309). Discours e is always comprised of social identities, social relations, and systems of knowle dge and beliefs and thus \"makes its own small contribution to shaping these aspects of society and culture\" (Fairclough, 2000, 309). If language use captures societal norms of the time, then media texts such as books, television, and movies from a specified p eriod are akin to cultural artifacts and provide a record of \"the 'big' ideas operating and evolving in a culture\" (Thomas, 1994, 686). We can use discourse analysis to examine medi a texts as cultural artifacts. Discourse analysis is a qualitative technique used to examine media content in a variety of different texts. It examines language us e as defined above, but more importantly, it explores the \"dialectical relations hip\" between language and society. According to Fairclough (2000), \"language is a soci ally and historically situated mode of action, in a dialectical relationship with other fa cets of the social . . . it is socially shaped, but is also socially shaping\u2014or socially constituti ve. Critical discourse analysis explores the tension between two sides of language use, the socially shaped and the socially constitutive\" (309). The purpose of discourse analy sis is to examine a text \"not only as form, meaning, and mental process, but as complex s tructures and hierarchies of interaction and social practice and their functions in context, society, and culture\" (van Djik, 1997, 6). For the purposes of the present stu dy, discourse analysis was used to examine how the HPV vaccine has been framed in tele vision vaccine ads and how this 42 framing reflects and at the same time influences th e target audiences' understanding of and attitude towards the vaccine specifically and s exual health more broadly. Theory behind discourse analysis contends that \"lan guage both mediates and constructs our understanding of reality . . . [and] can shed light on the creation and maintenance of social norms, the construction of pe rsonal and group identities, and the negotiation of social and political interaction\" (S tarks and Brown, 2007, 1374). By framing the HPV vaccine in a very specific way, the ads construct a \"reality\" for the audience that may or may not be real. This suggests that the HPV vaccine ads have the potential to shape the audience's understanding of who should get the vaccine and who is at risk for cervical cancer, for example. Examin ing the dimensions of this framing can help us to understand why the public knows the HPV vaccine can prevent cervical cancer but has less knowledge about the virus itsel f. Discourse analysis will also help to clarify why certain groups of people may feel more or less susceptible to HPV and cervical cancer, thus partially explaining why some demographics of people are more or less likely to get the vaccine. According to Fairclough (1995), analyzing the disc ourse of any text \"involves an alteration between twin, complementary focuses, bot h of which are essential: communicative events and the orders of discourse\" ( 56). A communicative event is the unit of analysis. Discourse analysis examines the r elationship between the three dimensions of a communicative event: the text, the discursive practices of a community, and the sociocultural context of the event. The tex t can be virtually anything that uses language (spoken, written, or non-verbal cues) to p roduce meaning (Fairclough, 2000). The discourse practice includes how the text is pro duced and how it is consumed within 43 the community. The sociocultural practice can be de fined as the immediate situational context of the communicative event or its wider con text like the economical, political, or cultural landscape in which it exists. We can exami ne a communicative event within the context of its orders of discourse, or how language is organized and used within society (referred to as genre ) and what social practice or point of view it repr esents (known as discourse ). By examining a communicative event through the l ens of its orders of discourse, we can understand the ways in which it i s \"normative, drawing upon familiar types and formats . . . and creative, using old res ources in new ways\" (Fairclough, 1995, 56). 1. Sample selection For the purposes of this study, the communicative e vent is the HPV vaccine commercial where the media text is defined as both the spoken and written language (the actual words used) and the visual lan guage (images of people, activities, places) used in the commercials. A total of nine di rect-to-consumer TV commercials for the HPV vaccine have been identified by the princip al investigator (PI) but only eight were available for viewing in the public domain at the time of this study. Therefore the sample consisted of the eight advertisments that we re available on YouTube at the time of analysis (Table III). The ad that is no longer p ublicly available for viewing was created by GSK and showed a woman sitting in a cafe waiting for her friends to arrive only to find out via text that they aren't coming because o ne of them found out she has cervical cancer. 44 TABLE III DESCRIPTION OF EIGHT HPV VACCINE ADS BY MANUFACTURE R a Titles were given by author and may not reflect act ual name of the ad. b Descriptions provided by the author through disco urse analysis.Company (Product) Title a Description b Merck (Gardasil) I chose (mothers and daughters) Mothers tell audience all the reasons why they chos e to vaccinate their daughters while doing mother-daught er bonding activities I choose (young women) Young women tell audience w hy they chose to vaccinate themselves One less (mothers and daughters) Mothers and daughters tell audience why getting vac cinated is a good idea and how it could make them become \"one less woman affected by cervical cancer\" while participat ing in mother-daughter bonding One less (young women) Young women and teenagers t alking about how they could be \"one less statistic\" while participating in a varie ty of physical activities What if?

Data collection In this study, discourse analysis was used to exami ne HPV vaccine commercials, analyzing the actual words used in eac h advertisement along with the nonverbal cues (lighting, music, colors, people, an d tone of voice) amid the sociocultural and discursive practices of the audience, or how pe ople think and talk about HPV. It also considered the orders of discourse and analyze d the ads within the context of pharmaceutical advertising logic whether the commer cials drew upon a normative or creative view of cancer and STI prevention, and if this view helped reinforce or restructure prevailing feelings about both conditio ns. Media discourse analysis was conducted by repeatedly watching the communicative texts and observing the language and production elements used to better understand w hat is being conveyed. Coding involved identifying themes in the text, not labeli ng parts of the text to be quantified later as with a content analysis. Discourse analysis is an iterative and inductive p rocess of decontextualization and recontextualization (Ayers et al., 2003) and is used to \"distill textual data to a set of categories or concepts from which the final product can be drawn\" (Starks et al., 2007, 1375). In order to do this rigorously, media texts must be examined through a theoretical framework. Framing theory guided the di scourse analysis of the HPV vaccine ads. Frames help audiences comprehend compl ex topics, like the HPV vaccine, by highlighting certain details to make them more s alient and downplaying other information. When using framing theory to explore t hese ads, two points are important to consider. First, the way an issue is framed in a media text is often reflective of how society at large views the topic, thus harkening ba ck to Fairclough's notion that 46 language is socially shaped and socially constituti ve. Therefore understanding how the HPV vaccine is framed in the ads may shed light on societal attitudes towards it. Moreover, understanding how this topic is situated in society will allow for discussion of how sexual health more broadly is viewed: as a pred ominantly female responsibility that should not be candidly discussed as a complex medic al reality but rather repackaged as something more politically palatable and otherwise tidy. Second, when examining the framing, it is also impo rtant to recognize who produced the text in order to better understand why certain dimensions of the issue are highlighted and others are not. In the case of the HPV vaccine commercials, the media texts were created by advertising companies, people who are in the business of selling ideas and products. Therefore, when examining the f raming of the ads, one must also incorporate advertising logic to guide the analysis . This discourse analysis used framing theory to distill the vaccine ads into thematic fra mes that collectively show how the information highlighted and downplayed in the ads s erved to sell vaccines and bolster the pharmaceutical companies' bottomlines while als o reinforcing the prevailing attitudes about sexual health. This analysis was also guided by a combination of c onstructs from health behavior theories, including the HBM, TPB, and the IBM, thought to influence HPV vaccine intention or uptake (de Visser et al., 2011 ; Gerend and Sheperd, 2011; severity; perceived norms; and self-efficacy. To run this discourse ana lysis, I watched all of the ads repeatedly each time noting observations about how the ads targeted these five underlying beliefs. These contructs were operationa lized along four dimensions: (1) 47 tone , in terms of language, overall orientation as well as audio/visual cues; (2) audience , defined as who the ad is speaking to and who is b eing portrayed in it; (3) agency , or who the ad suggests has the power to prevent t he infection; (4) frame , or what information was highlighted about HPV and HPV- related diseases and what was downplayed. I also examined each ad within the cont ext of its orders of discourse, noting how the language used reflected the organiza tional properities of advertising (genre) and the specific point of view it represent s (discourse). This analysis also included observations about ways in which the ads w ere normative , adhering to the traditional advertising format and thus reinforcing established hierarchies and power dynamics, and creative , restructuring these relationships. 3. Analysis Each commercial was reviewed individually and obser vations about these four dimensions and the orders of discourse were no ted. Ads were viewed repeatedly until no new observations were noted and data reach ed saturation to better understand what each communicates regarding tone, audience, ag ency, frame, and genre and by extension, the underlying beliefs they represent. A fter observing each ad individually, all ads for the same product were compared. Themes foun d in Merck ads were then compared to themes found in GSK ads. Finally, overa rching themes were identified across all ads (Ayres et al., 2003). 48 B. Focus Groups After examining the commercials through discourse analysis, this study explored the same vaccine ads from the perspective of the de cision-makers. The focus-group component of this study examines how vaccine decisi on-maker knowledge changed based on the message framing used in the ads, the e xtent to which the ads targeted underlying beliefs about getting the HPV vaccine an d how, if at all, these beliefs resonated with vaccine decision-makers. Focus groups were first used in World War II to exa mine morale and propaganda (Morgan, 1997). Shortly thereafter, they were used in marketing research to assess people's responses to radio broadcasts. However, fo cus groups were not used in academic research until the 1980s (Krueger and Case y, 2009). The purpose of a focus group is to gain understanding of a particular grou p's opinion on a certain topic (C\u00f4t\u00e9- Arsenault and Morrison-Beedy, 2005). Focus-group in terviews are used for a variety of purposes. Lunt and Livingston (1996) suggest that f ocus groups can be used to better understand how audiences make sense of and distill meaning from what they see on TV. They are often used to explore decisions made i n a social context (Patton, 1990) and for exploring knowledge and experiences to bett er understand not only what people think but how they think (Kitzinger, 1995). All of these suggested uses make focus groups an appropriate format for discussing HPV vac cine ads. Focus groups relied on a parallel/simultaneous mixe d-method design to collect quantitative and qualitative data at the same time (Tashakkori and Teddlie, 1998). Focus-group data (qualitative) and survey data (qua ntitative) were collected simultaneously from the same sample in a single-pha se study in order to generate 49 numerical and narrative data about the same phenome na (Creswell, 2008): how vaccine decision-maker knowledge changed based on t he ads. This approach is illustrated in Figure 4. The focus-group data also explore reactions to the ads more broadly. The sample consisted of males and females ages 15 -26 and parents of children ages 11 -17. Table IV illustrates how the data collection in struments measure the main constructs being explored in this research . 50 Data Results Synthesis Focus Group/Interviews (Qualitative) Survey (Quantitative) Knowledge about HPV Pre-ads Post-ads Knowledge about HPV vaccine Findings Figure 4 . mixed-methods approach. 51 TABLE IV CONSTRUCT-INSTRUMENTATION CROSSWALK Construct Question(s) Instrument Media Exposure Has anyone seen ads for the HPV vaccine?

Data collection The focus-group work consisted of six main componen ts and collected both qualitative and quantitative data (Figure 5). First, all participants were given a pre- survey upon arrival to the focus group to collect d ata on their baseline knowledge of HPV and the HPV vaccine before viewing the HPV vacc ine ads during the focus-group session. Beyond collecting baseline data, the pre-s urvey also served to assess group effects of the focus groups and collect data on vac cine receipt and intention that contributes to our understanding of the relationshi p between underlying beliefs and intention or uptake. Second, participants discussed what they knew or what they had heard about HPV and the HPV vaccine with other memb ers of the focus group (pre-ad discussion). Third, participants watched the eight direct-to-consumer HPV vaccine ads from the discourse analysis (Table III). Two groups (males and females aged 15 -17) were unable to watch one of the ads (\"Music Video\") because of technical difficulties. Ads were watched consecutively without discussion i n between. Fourth, participants completed a post-survey to measure short-term knowl edge change based on message framing in the ads. The post-survey was given befor e discussing the ads with the group to capture the influence of the message frame only and not potential group effects. Fifth, participants discussed their reactions to the ads, both in terms of what they learned and the extent to which the ads resonated with them (po st-ad discussion). Finally, after the post-ad discussion, the moderator provided factual information about topics discussed and answered participant questions (fact reveal). E ach component is discussed in detail below. 57 Pre-Survey Pre-Ad Discussion Post-Ad Discussion Fact RevealWatch Ads Post-Survey Figure 5. Mixed methods process used to collect data during focus groups. Ovals = quantitative method; rectangles = qualitati ve method; diamonds = study component. a. Pre-focus-group questionnaire A brief, anonymous, self-administered, pen-and-pape r survey was given to all participants (Appendix A). Questionnai res took less than five minutes to complete and contained questions to gather data abo ut HPV vaccine receipt, intention to vaccinate, and knowledge of HPV and the HPV vacc ine. Gathering these data established participant baseline knowledge prior to seeing the commercials and engaging in the focus-group discussion. 58 b. Focus-group session Focus groups are semi-structured conversations, led, but not controlled, by a facilitator. Discussion guides aid the facilitator in moderating the conversation but must necessarily be flexible enoug h to allow the facilitator to ask clarifying or probing questions based on comments, thoughts, or ideas of the participants. It must also be broad enough to allow participants the freedom to respond and interact with one another. Questions should beg in broad and move toward the specific (C\u00f4t\u00e9-Arsenault and Morrison-Beedy, 1999). Krueger and Casey (2009) recommend about 12 questions per 1 -2 hour focus-group session but others suggest using fewer in order to cover all topics and still have ample time for all participants to share their thoughts (Patton, 1990; C\u00f4t\u00e9-Arsenault and Morrison-Beedy, 1999). Similar but separate discussion guides were used for parent s and vaccine eligibles (see Appendix B). The focus-group sessions aimed to gene rate discussion of the following ideas: Pre-knowledge and attitudes about HPV and the HPV v accine What did participants know about HPV prior to watc hing the ads? What did participants know about the HPV vaccine p rior to watching the ads? Had participants seen HPV vaccine ads before the f ocus group? Post-knowledge and attitudes about HPV and the HPV vaccine What did participants know about HPV after watchin g the ads? What did participants know about the HPV vaccine a fter watching the ads? Had participants seen HPV vaccine ads before the f ocus group? 59 Discussion of HPV vaccine commercials How did the ads target the participants' perceived susceptibility of HPV? How did the ads target the participants' perceived barriers to getting the HPV vaccine? How did the ads target the participants' perceived severity of HPV? How did the ads target the participants' perceived norms about HPV and the HPV vaccine? How did the ads target participant self-efficacy i n regards to getting the HPV vaccine? Which ads were most compelling? Why? The PI of this study served as the focus-group mod erator for all 12 sessions. The same notetaker also attended all 12 sessions and se rved as a second set of eyes and ears. The moderator and the notetaker debriefed eac h focus-group session immediately afterward (C\u00f4t\u00e9-Arsenault and Morrison-Beedy, 2005) and documented their observations separately shortly thereafter. Data an alysis began with these debriefings and continued through the formal process detailed b elow. c. Post-focus-group questionnaire A brief, anonymous, self-administered, pen-and-pape r survey was given to all participants directly after watching t he HPV vaccine ads during the focus- group discussion. A separate questionnaire was give n to parents and vaccine-eligibles. (See Appendix C). The post-focus-group questionnair es helped to assess the extent to which participant knowledge changed immediately aft er watching the HPV vaccine ads. Questionnaires took no longer than 10 minutes and g athered the following data: 60 Knowledge Same questions as in pre focus-group questionnaire to compare whether ads and discussion changed short-term knowledge Vaccine behavior and exposure history HPV vaccine uptake history HPV vaccine future intention Reasons for HPV vaccine uptake/abstinence Receipt of other vaccines Exposure to ads previous to focus group Demographics Age Sex Race/ethnicity Highest grade level completed Religious affiliation (Y/N) Political affiliation. 2. Sample A stratified purposive sampling design was used t o recruit 45 participants (Coyne, 1997; Patton, 1990). A total of 12 qualitat ive interviews were conducted. Eleven focus-group sessions were held at the University of Illinois (UIC) School of Public Health and one was conducted at the Illinois Caucus for Ad olescent Health (a Chicago community-based organization). Group size varied si gnificantly and consisted of 1 -10 people. The target sample size for this study was 7 2, yielding an average of six people per focus group. This number is commonly suggested in the literature to ensure that the group is large enough to obtain a variety of opinio ns but small enough to allow each person to contribute in a meaningful way (Krueger a nd Casey, 2009; Morgan, 1997). In the end, 77 people were recruited and confirmed to participate in this study; however, only 57% of those who said they would attend actual ly participated. To be eligible for the study, participants needed to fall into one of two categories: males and females 61 ages 15 -26 or parents of a male or female child ages 11 -17. Groups were stratified to maximize homogeneity within the groups based on cog nitive development, sex, and role (parent or vaccine-eligible) (C\u00f4t\u00e9-Arsenault and Mo rrison-Beedy, 1999). Of the 12 sessions, six were held for parent groups (n=15) an d included 10 mothers (three discussing sons, seven discussing daughters) and fi ve fathers (three discussing sons, two discussing daughters). The other six sessions c onsisted of males and females between the ages of 15 and 26 or \"vaccine-eligibles \" (n=30). There were only two sets of parent-child dyads who participated in the focus groups: a 15 -17 year old male and his mom and a 15 -17 year old female and her mom. Table V describes t he sample. TABLE V FOCUS GROUPS BY DECISION-MAKER ROLE, AGE, AND SEX Parents of 11 -12 year olds Parents of 13 -14 year olds Parents of 15 -17 year olds 15 -17 year olds 18 -21 year olds 22 -26 year olds Total Females 4 2 3 10 4 6 29 Males 3 1 2 3 2 5 16 Total 7 3 4 13 6 11 45 While youth ages 15 -17 are not technically vaccine decision-makers, it was important to include them in the research for two m ain reasons. First, adolescents have the highest rates of STIs. Nearly half of the 19 mi llion new STI cases each year are among young people aged 15-24 (Weinstock et al., 20 04). A recent study examining the prevalence of STIs among this population sugges ts that nearly 40% of sexually 62 experienced girls ages 14 -19 had one of the five most common STIs (gonorrhea, chlamydia, trichomoniasis, HPV, Of these STIs, HPV was by far the most common, with 18.3% of participa nts yielding a positive test result at the time of the study. In another study examining t he prevalence of HPV, researchers found that the virus affects one-third of adolescen t females, or roughly 7.5 million females in this age group (Dunne et al., 2007). Con ducting research about influences on a behavior that protects against an STI needs to include the entire range of those who have the highest rates (e.g., 15 -17-year olds). Second, adolescents are at the greatest risk of contracting an STI because of incr eased biological susceptibility based on age and development, increased risky sexual beha vior, and limited access to healthcare (CDC, 2008). Examining how media influen ces their underlying beliefs and their understanding of HPV and the vaccine (a prote ctive behavior) is important. 3. Recruitment Recruitment took place from September -December 2012. Announcements explaining the study were posted on v irtual message boards including Facebook, Craigslist, the Neighborhood Parents Netw ork, and Research Chicago. The recruitment process also involved word-of-mouth rec ruiting as well as a degree of snowballing: the recruitment flyer was emailed to U IC group listservs and sent to other points of contact the PI thought may fit, or know p eople who fit, the eligibility criteria. Points of contact received the emailed recruitment flyer and were encouraged to forward it on to others they thought may be interes ted in participating in the research. At a minimum, points of contact included colleagues, f riends, and other acquaintances 63 from the following organizations: Asian Health Coal ition, Illinois Caucus for Adolescent Health, Teach for America, and UNO Charter Network. Announcements invited individuals who were interes ted in participating to call or email research personnel. The announcement included pertinent details about the research study and eligibility criteria and was app roved by the UIC Institutional Review Board. (See Appendix D). The PI conducted a brief e ligibility screening of potential participants by phone or email as part of the recru itment process. If a participant met inclusion criteria the PI scheduled them into the a ppropriate focus group (e.g., for their age, sex, decision-maker role). At that time, the f ollowing information was collected: (1) contact phone number or email address in case of ca ncellation/rescheduling of the focus group; (2) name of participant; (3) age of va ccine-eligible; (4) sex of vaccine eligible; and (5) decision-maker role (e.g., parent or vaccine-eligible). Information about the focus-group location and transportation (train and bus options) was also given to participants. Each participant was sent an informat ion sheet about the focus group after recruitment. Reminders were sent by email to all pa rticipants one week before, the day before, and the day of the focus group. Participant s without email addresses were reminded by phone. Informed consent was obtained from each participan t age 18 and over upon arrival for the focus group. Assent was obtained fr om participants ages 15 -17. Parental permission was obtained for participants ages 15 -17. Parents were allowed to submit their permission by email, mail, or in person befor e the focus groups. Each session was audio-recorded and transcribed. All participants we re given a $20 Target gift card after 64 the 90-minute focus-group session. Consent, assent, and permission forms can be found in Appendix E. 4. Focus-group data analysis Audio recordings of the focus groups were transcrib ed verbatim by a professional transcription service and subsequently reviewed and verified by the focus- group moderator. All participants were given pseudo nyms by the moderator before uploading the transcripts to Atlas/TI, a software p rogram for managing and analyzing qualitative data (Muhr, 2012). A description of the data analysis components follows. a. Coding Transcripts were coded in Atlas/TI by two research assistants: coder A and coder B. Each coded six transcripts. Th e initial coding guide was developed around the conceptual model hypothesizing the relationship between message framing and five underlying beliefs illustr ated in Figure 3. Codes were specified as components of an overarching family. A fter coding one transcript, the coders met with the PI to discuss any issues encoun tered and suggest changes to the coding guide (Hruschka et al., 2004). Using the upd ated coding guide, both coders finished coding their batch of transcripts. Coders were instructed to segment data into \"ideas\" with each quotation consisting of a complet e idea, either from one person or an exchange between focus-group participants. Memos we re used to explain why certain codes were used and to provide context to the quote that was not captured within the highlighted text; for example, which clip the respo ndent was referring to if they did not 65 state it. The coding guide went through four versio ns and was amended after several rounds of coding. The final coding guide can be fou nd in Appendix F. After all of the transcripts had been coded, coder A reviewed 10% of coder B's codes and vice versa. The moderator also coded one transcript from each coder as an additional reliability check. Inter-rater reliabili ty between the two coders was low. However, inter-rater reliability between coder A an d the moderator was satisfactory: 80% overlap. Based on these checks, coder A was ask ed to re-code coder B's other four transcripts. All transcripts used in the analy sis were coded by coder A. The moderator conducted one final inter-rater reliabili ty check on 10% of coder A's transcripts and the overlap level was the same. All discrepancies were examined by the moderator who made the final decision as to which c ode was accurately applied based on having been in the focus groups, her subject-mat ter expertise, and familiarity with the coding guide and conceptual model. Most of the disc repancies seemed to be the result of coder fatigue and not systematic coding error. b. Qualitative analysis Focus-group debrief write-ups guided much of the an alysis and provided a starting point for theme generation. Dat a were analyzed in two separate parts. First, all message-framing codes were querie d using Atlas/TI's Query Tool (a search tool in which Boolean connectors can be used to construct complex search strings involving multiple codes). All pre-ad codes were examined together and explored for themes about what focus-group participants knew before watching the ads. Quotes about pre-ad HPV knowledge were coded separately fr om pre-ad vaccine knowledge. 66 Themes about what participants as a whole knew abou t HPV and the HPV vaccine before watching the ads were documented. At this po int, each case (one focus group) was examined to see the variability and commonaliti es across groups. The same process was used to examine the post-ad codes. Afte r both pre-ad and post-ad codes were examined separately, they were compared to see how knowledge had changed before and after watching the ads. The second part of the analysis was conducted on t he underlying belief families (norms, severity, susceptibility, self-efficacy, ba rriers). First, all of the codes assigned to one family were queried and the attached quotations were examined to see if there were any emerging themes across focus-group discuss ions. After all of the code families were analyzed separately, themes from each of the code families were compared to see if any of the themes were captured by more than one underlying belief family (Friese, 2011). 5. Survey data analysis Surveys were administered before and after particip ants watched the eight HPV vaccine ads. All data were entered into Excel f or cleaning and coding. Descriptive statistics were calculated in Excel to summarize th e sample. To check the normality of the distribution, a Shapiro-Wilks test was conducte d. Because the pre- and post-data were normally distributed, I used a paired t test t o analyze total knowledge change by participant. McNemar's test was used to calculate p re- and post-knowledge change by survey question. McNemar's exact test was used for samples less than five. Significance level was set at p<.05. All data were analyzed using Stata 11.0. 67 C. Strengths and Limitations This study has several strengths. First, it uses a creative and appropriate mixed- methods design to explore media's distal influence on HPV vaccine decision-making. Discourse analysis was used to examine the HPV vacc ine ads themselves \u2014how the vaccine has been framed and if any of these frames target underlying beliefs that predict vaccine intention and uptake. Findings from the discourse analysis were used to inform the focus-group discussions that examined ho w the framing changed decision- maker knowledge of HPV and the HPV vaccine, and the extent to which the beliefs targeted by the ads resonated among vaccine decisio n-makers. Most discourse analyses conclude with theme generation and do not go on to explore their findings through subsequent methods; therefore, this approac h is not only unique but contributes to an important gap in the methodological literatur e. Second, this study addresses several gaps in the HP V-vaccine framing literature. Most studies have examined theoretical message fram ing and have not looked at how the vaccine has actually been framed. In addition, few studies have explored the effects of framing on underlying beliefs that appear to be predictive of vaccine uptake and/or intention. This study does both. Finally, at the ti me of this writing, only one study (Leader et al., 2011) had examined actual HPV vacci ne ads. In that study, however, researchers only looked at one television ad for Ga rdasil to gauge understanding and reaction to presented messages and information amon g female adolescents. The present study examined a range of different televis ion ads and measured reactions of not only females but males as well, an as-yet under studied group when it comes to the HPV vaccine. In addition, this study also involved parents of female- and male-eligibles, 68 a third group of people that have been and will con tinue to be included in the target audience for these commercials. Third, this study systematically examined the overt and latent content of the ads and how they influence attitudes and behaviors abou t HPV vaccines. While Malkowski (2013) explored the narrative discourse of a differ ent Gardasil campaign (a pamphlet- based communication called \"My Voice\"), to my knowl edge there have not been any studies examining the content of these particular a ds. This research also has several limitations. First, this study used a small purposive sample. While this sampling method is app ropriate for a qualitative investigation, the results of this study are not re presentative of the entire population of vaccine decision-makers. Second, participants knew that the purpose of the focus group was to give feedback on the ads. Therefore, they ma y have given greater thought to the content of the ads than they would have in a non-re search setting. Third, some factual information about HPV was necessarily given in the informed consent documents that could have affected pre-knowledge levels. Finally, although the moderator did not answer questions about HPV or the vaccine during fo cus groups or interviews, and participants were asked to fill out post-tests imme diately after viewing the ads, responses may have been influenced by what other re spondents said during pre-ad discussion. 69 IV. MANUSCRIPTS Findings from this research are presented in a seri es of three manuscripts and collectively address the two questions that guided this study. The first paper in the series uses discourse analysis to examine how direc t-to-consumer ads frame the vaccine: the extent to which information has been h ighlighted and downplayed in order to maximize vaccine uptake and thus profit. This an alysis also reveals which underlying beliefs are targeted by this framing. Addressing re search question 1, the first manuscript provides insight into how the HPV vaccine is framed and sheds light on societal attitudes toward it specifically, and sexual health more broadly. The second manuscript uses a mixed-methods approach to explore how the fr aming of the ads changed vaccine decision-maker knowledge about HPV and the HPV vaccine. Relying on the focus-group and survey data, paper two addresses th e second research question and suggests that the framing changed vaccine decision- maker knowledge and that the messages therein served to clarify some and confuse others based on their previous knowledge and confidence. The third paper is the mo st integrative of the manuscripts and not only addresses both research questions, but maps the focus-group data onto the discourse analysis themes by way of the five un derlying belief constructs that conceptually guide this research. 70 A. Manuscript 1: \"When Sex Doesn't Sell: Marketing the Human Papillomavirus Vaccine\" 1. Summary Human Papillomavirus (HPV) is the most common STI i n the United States. It typically clears on its own within two y ears of infection. Therefore, while the majority of sexually active people will contract HP V at some point in their lives, most will not have long-term consequences. However, some stra ins of persistent HPV can develop into a more serious infection and cause eit her genital warts or cancer. Although HPV is often associated with cervical cancer it can also lead to anal and oropharyngeal cancers. Over the past seven years, two companies h ave developed vaccines to prevent several common strains of HPV. While this i s an exciting development in public health, it is also a case study in message framing as both companies have marketed their vaccines not as STI prevention but as an anti dote to cervical cancer. The present study uses discourse analysis to examine how eight direct-to-consumer ads have framed the HPV vaccine. Both framing theory and a c ombination of constructs from relevant health-behavior theories guide this analys is and provide the framework in which to understand what the highlighted and downpl ayed information in these ads suggest about social norms around cancer and HPV sp ecifically and sexual health more broadly. 71 2. Introduction Although the old adage would have us believe otherw ise, sex doesn't always sell. When it's portrayed as glossy and perf ect it does, but when it results in an infection, it creates discussion and fear, as oppos ed to an increased profit margin. So how does a pharmaceutical company market a vaccine that prevents an STI? An illustration of this came in 2006, when the FDA app roved the first vaccine to protect against HPV. In order to avoid STI-related stigma, the makers of the vaccine launched a marketing campaign branding it an antidote to cervi cal cancer and skimming over what the vaccine actually protects against: a sexually t ransmitted virus. Given the stigma around STIs, and the fact that vaccine administrati on is recommended before sexual debut, framing the vaccine as protecting against ca ncer likely makes it more publicly palatable and even desirable: who doesn't want to p rotect themselves or their children from cancer? When a second company brought their HP V vaccine to market, their TV ads framed the issue in the same way. In order to s ell more vaccines, both companies have attempted to bypass any discussion of STIs and focus solely on how their products can prevent cancer. Without a doubt, HPV v accines are exciting public health advances for both STI and cancer prevention. Howeve r, the question remains: what does framing the vaccine as cervical cancer prevent ion communicate about HPV and cancer specifically and the nature of sexual health more broadly? a. Human papillomavirus With more than 40 strains that can be contracted th rough sexual activity, HPV is the most common STI in the United States. Both men and women can 72 get HPV and subsequently transmit it to their sexua l partners. The main risk factors associated with HPV infection appear to be young ag e at sexual debut and high number of sexual partners (NCI, 2012; Kim et al., 2011; Ro teli-Martins et al., 2011). While most sexually active people will contract it at some poi nt in their lives, the majority will not develop HPV-related diseases. However, some strains of persistent HPV can develop into a more serious infection and cause either geni tal warts or cancer. Although the virus is most commonly associated with cervical can cer, HPV can also cause anal, vaginal, vulvar, penile, and oropharyngeal cancers. High-risk HPV types can develop into cancer including HPV 16 and HPV 18, which caus e more than 70% of all cervical cancer cases in the United States (NCI, 2012). Two low-risk strains, HPV 6 and HPV 11, cause 90% of genital warts (Garland et al., 200 9). Pap tests are used to detect pre- cancerous cells and cervical abnormalities. While a DNA test can detect HPV, clinical guidelines only recommend screening for women over the age of 30 during a regular Pap test. The prevalence of HPV is highest in women under 30 (Dunne et al., 2007); however, because of the high rate of clearance and lack of treatment for HPV, screening is not recommended for this group. There is no routine screening for other HPV-related cancers or genital warts. This means th at while both men and women can get HPV, there is no way to screen men. Condoms do not always protect against HPV infection but there are vaccines available that can prevent the most prevalent strains. b. Vaccines on the market Two different HPV vaccines are currently on the ma rket in the United States. In 2006, the FDA approved Merck's Ga rdasil which protects against HPV 73 6 and 11, two strains that cause 90% of genital war ts, and HPV 16 and 18, which cause 70% of cervical cancer and nearly half of all vagin al, vulvar, and penile cancer. One strain, HPV 16, is responsible for more than 85% of anal cancer. Beyond anogenital cancers, HPV 16 also causes more than half of the c ancers diagnosed in the oropharynx (NCI, 2012; Chow et al., 2010; Watson et al., 2008). Initially only approved for females 9 -26, Gardasil was approved for use in males 9 -26 in October 2009. Around the same time, the FDA approved a second vac cine, GSK's Cervarix, which protects against HPV 16 and 18 for use in females 1 0 -25. Both vaccines provide coverage for the two most common high-risk strains of the infection. Because HPV 6 and 11 cause 90% of genital warts, Gardasil has bee n shown to benefit males as well as females. The CDC's ACIP currently recommends Gar dasil for routine vaccination in both females and males ages 11 and 12, in order to vaccinate before sexual debut, as part of the adolescent immunization platform but ca n be started as early as 9 years old per physician discretion. In addition, ACIP recomme nds that females 13 -26 and males ages 13 -21 who have not been immunized previously, or who h ave not received all three doses, complete the vaccine series. Men ages 22 -26 may receive the vaccine but ACIP did not find a recommendation for this group t o be cost effective (CDC, 2011). Routine use of Cervarix in girls ages 11 -12 and as a catch-up vaccination for females ages 13 -26 is also recommended by ACIP (CDC, 2010). c. Message framing Framing theory suggests that how information is presented can influence the way a person thinks about a particula r issue by highlighting certain details 74 and downplaying others. Frames provide a way for pe ople to understand complicated issues by defining a problem, suggesting a cause, a nd recommending a solution (Entman, 1993). Framing involves two main component s: selection (highlighting what is important and what the audience should pay attentio n to) and salience (making pieces of information noticeable, meaningful, or memorable to the audience). By selecting the right information and elevating an issue's salience , framing increases the probability that audiences will receive the information, discern its meaning, and then process and store it in their memory (Entman, 1993). In addition, med ia frames often reflect the wider public discourse on certain issues and, if the fram e is dominant enough, influence public opinion. Through selection and salience, framing ca n also prime audiences to be more accepting of certain ideas and perspectives (Kahnem an and Tversky, 1984). Since the development of the HPV vaccine, several s tudies have examined its framing (Bigman et al., 2010; Gerend and Shepard, 2 009; Leader et al., 2009; Sperber et al., 2007) all of which shed some light on why G ardasil and Cervarix are being framed as cervical cancer vaccines and why there ha s been little focus on HPV or its sexual transmission. The findings of these studies suggest that people are more likely to say they intend to vaccinate if the vaccine protect s against cervical cancer, as opposed to an STI and if the effectiveness of the vaccine i s framed positively. Further, findings of several of these studies suggest that perceived sus ceptibility may moderate acceptance and thus needs to be considered when designing mess ages. Finally, at least one study suggests that people are more likely to remember me ssages about cancer prevention as opposed to STI prevention. 75 Most studies exploring message framing and the HPV vaccine have examined the effect of message framing on acceptability (Lid don et al., 2010; Gerend et al., 2008; Sperber et al., 2007; Friedman and Shepeard, 2007; Gerend and Shepherd, 2007) and intention to vaccinate (Lechuga et al., 2011; Bigma n et al., 2010; Leader et al., 2009). More recently, several studies have looked at the e ffects of message framing on vaccine uptake (Gerend and Sheperd, 2011; Jurskova et al., 2011). These studies suggest that framing the vaccine as preventing cerv ical cancer may: (1) increase vaccine intention by targeting certain underlying b eliefs such as perceived susceptibility, perceived costs, perceived severity, and subjective norms; (2) minimize STI-related stigma thus increasing uptake; and (3) not resonate with male vaccine-eligibles, even as a way to protect their female partners. Collectivel y, these studies suggest that message framing is important and that it may have an effect on parental and adolescent underlying beliefs. d. Gaps in the literature The framing studies and focus-group research ref erenced above support the approach taken by Merck and GSK: highli ght cervical cancer prevention and downplay the link between cancer and an STI. This a pproach makes sense for two reasons. First, the vaccine is a great achievement in public health: it prevents the two strains of HPV that cause 70% of all cervical cance r. Increasing acceptability and uptake of the vaccine is clearly a good thing. Seco nd, publicly discussing the link between an STI (HPV) and cervical cancer may stigma tize people who have or have had cervical cancer. The inherent stigma around STI s could lead to decreased rates in 76 HPV and cervical cancer screenings. So, arguably, f raming these vaccines as fighting cervical cancer could minimize stigma of cancer pat ients. However, at the time of this writing, none of the available literature analyzes the framing of the ads themselves. This paper examines eight publicly available direct-to- consumer ads to better understand how the HPV vacci ne has been framed; which aspects have been selected and made salient and whi ch have been downplayed; how this framing simultaneously reflects and shapes soc ial norms. 3. Methods a. Discourse analysis Discourse includes \"spoken or written language u se\" as well as \"visual images (photography, video, diagrams) and n on-verbal communication (e.g., gestures)\" (Fairclough, 2000, 309). Language use is both shaped by and reflective of the society in which it exists; therefore, social i dentities, social relations, and systems of knowledge and belief are always embedded in discour se. Media texts like TV ads can act as cultural artifacts that capture and document the social norms of a given time period or \"the 'big' ideas operating and evolving i n a culture\" (Thomas, 1994, 686). We can use discourse analysis to distill meaning from these cultural artifacts. Discourse analysis is a qualitative technique us ed to examine a text \"not only as form, meaning and mental process, but as complex st ructures and hierarchies of interaction and social practice and their functions in context, society and culture\" (van Djik, 1997, 6). According to Fairclough (1995), ana lyzing the discourse of any text \"involves an alteration between twin, complementary focuses, both of which are 77 essential: communicative events and the orders of d iscourse\" (56). The communicative event is the unit of analysis. A communicative even t is comprised of the text (anything that produces cultural meaning), the discursive pra ctice (how the text is produced and how it is consumed within the society) and sociocul tural practice (the immediate situational context or its economic, political or c ultural landscape). Discourse analysis examines the relationship between these three dimen sions of a communicative event. We can examine a communicative event within the con text its orders of discourse, or how language is organized and used within society ( referred to as genre) and what social practice or point of view it represents (kno wn as discourse). By examining a communicative event through the lens of its orders of discourse, we can understand the ways in which it is \"normative, drawing upon famili ar types and formats . . . and creative, using old resources in new ways\" (Fairclough, 1995, 56). b. Analysis In this study, the communicative event is an HPV vaccine commercial where the media text includes spoken and written language as well as visual language (images of people, activities, plac es) used in the ads. Although nine HPV vaccine television ads were originally identifi ed for the sample, only eight were available for viewing at the time of analysis: thre e were created by GSK and the other five by Merck. All eight ads were viewed on YouTube in fall 2012 (Table III). The present study uses framing theory and a combina tion of health behavior constructs to analyze the vaccine ads. Message fram es help audiences understand complicated issues by highlighting certain details and downplaying others in an effort to 78 make the information more salient. Framing in the m edia both shapes and reflects social norms. Examining the framing used in these a ds will allow us to glimpse how society views not only the HPV vaccine, but sexual health more broadly. In order to understand why certain dimensions of the issue are highlighted and others are not, who produced the text must be considered during discour se analysis. Because the HPV vaccine commercials were created to sell a product advertising logic was also used to guide the analysis. Finally, this study also draws on a combination of constructs from health behavior theories, including the HBM, TPB, and the IBM, thou ght to influence HPV vaccine intention or uptake (de Visser et al., 2011; Gerend and Sheperd, 2011; Bleakley et al., 2009): perceived susceptibility (the extent to whic h someone believes they are at risk for HPV or its sequelae); perceived barriers (potential roadblocks that could prevent someone from getting the HPV vaccine); perceived se verity (how serious the consequences of not getting vaccinated are); percei ved norms (beliefs about what others think they should do and what others like th em are doing); and self-efficacy (the perceived ability to control the behavior and the o utcome). To run this discourse analysis, I viewed all of the ads multiple times and observed them with an eye towards these five underl ying beliefs. Since these beliefs are conceptual, I operationalized them along four d imensions: (1) tone , in terms of language, overall orientation as well as audio/visu al cues capturing perceived susceptibility and perceived severity; (2) audience , defined as who the ad is speaking to and who is being portrayed in it reflecting perceiv ed norms; (3) agency , or who the ad suggests has the power to prevent the infection enc ompassing self-efficacy; (4) frame , 79 or what information was highlighted about HPV and H PV-related diseases and what was downplayed, covering perceived barriers, percei ved susceptibility, and perceived severity. Additionally, I observed each ad within the context of its orders of discourse, considering the genre and discourse . Because the communicative events in this study are advertisements, they are \"rooted in the orders of discourse of commodity production, distribution, and consumption\" (the gen re) but also have elements of the medical institution (discourse) and must be examine d within this context (Fairclough, 1995, 63). This analysis also included observation about ways in which the ads were normative , reinforcing boundaries and relationships in socie ty and creative , redrawing these lines. Ads were viewed repeatedly until no ne w observations were noted and data reached saturation. 4. Discussion All vaccine ads were viewed multiple times to bet ter understand how they targeted certain underlying beliefs. After noting o bservations about each individual ad, all ads for the same product were compared. Themes found in Merck ads were then compared to themes found in GSK ads. Finally, four overarching themes were identified across all ads (Ayres et al., 2003). a. Prevention and disruption While most of the ads mentioned the acronym HPV, that is not what they were about. All eight ads were about cervical cancer, either preventing it or 80 imagining what a future with the disease would be l ike. Most of the ads conformed to the traditional direct-to-consumer ad structure, th e normative commercial, and showed young women speaking directly to the camera, someti mes with their mothers, about why they chose to get the HPV vaccine. Much like ot her ads that market other sexual health products, like condoms or herpes treatment m edication, the tone of these ads was rather positive: if you get the HPV vaccine you don't need to worry about cervical cancer. As several of the mothers in the ads noted, \"It's about prevention.\" These ads looked and felt like typical pharmaceutical ads wit h the side effects, contraindications, and warnings listed on the bottom of the screen and described by the vaccinated girls and young women portrayed in the ad. The other half of the ads were a bit darker and more narrative, unlike most drug commercials. These ads didn't always mention the HPV vaccine they were promoting but all acknowledge d that there is a way to prevent cervical cancer. One of these more creative commerc ials, produced by GSK, lets you in on a phone conversation between two good friends, o ne of whom reveals that their third mutual friend is \"a mess\" because she just found ou t she has cervical cancer and \"doesn't think she will be able to have kids.\" The ad closes with a black screen and the words: \"But there are ways to prevent it. Talk to y our doctor\" followed by \"Cervical Cancer. Closer than you know.\" This commercial impl ies an air of fear and sadness: cervical cancer can happen to anyone, even people c lose to you, and could impact fertility. No one is safe. Overall, it was a fairly even split between the mo re optimistic and pessimistic ads. Regardless of the tone of these commercials, a ll of the ads suggest that cervical cancer is a \"disruption\" to the lives of young wome n. This message was both explicit 81 and implicit in the normative commercials through l ines like \"my dreams don't include cervical cancer.\" These ads followed the template o f other direct-to-consumer ads by showing young women being active and enjoying life\u2014 playing sports, shopping, baking, sewing, drinking tea, and bonding with their mother s\u2014implying that getting the vaccine will protect these happy scenes and prevent any dis ruption. In the creative ads, the message was more implicit. For example, another one of GSK's commercials opens with a beautiful couture-clad young women lounging on a settee reading a book when she notices little glimmers of light moving through her home traveling up the stairs. When she follows these beautiful glimmers she notic es a perfume bottle at the end of the hall. As she approaches the bottle the music is light and warm but as she gets closer she notices the bottle is labeled \"cervical cancer.\" The music stops, her hopes and dreams are shattered. Then a voice says: \"maybe it's unfair to get your attention this way, but nothing's fair about cervical cancer. \" A third ad from GSK shows women strutting confidently in an open loft space to the lyrics \"I know where I'm headed if I want it I'll get it. You can't stop me I'm a woman on my way.\" But the music does stop and so do the beautiful young women. When the words \"cervi cal cancer\" appear in red on the wall, the women turn to look at it in surprise and shock. The narrator notes that \"nothing should stop young women\" and as the wise voice deta ils Cervarix the music begins to play and the women begin to dance synchronously. In both genres, normative and creative, cervical cancer has disrupted or has the potential to disrupt the lives of young women. The ads also remind the audience that there are ways to prevent this possible disruption. The main difference between the two gen res is the setup: optimistic commercials begin by talking about preventing the d isruption, while the pessimistic 82 commercials focus on how the disruption could look and then suggest asking your doctor about how to prevent it (e.g., getting the v accine). Vaccines prevent diseases. Even still, choosing to \"sell\" prevention is an interesting approach. While the Affordable Care Act will change things, traditionally, the US healthcare system has not rewarded prevention. M any people are uninsured or underinsured and don't have access to preventative services and some payers do not cover all preventive care services. Similarly, many people lack a primary-care provider or have other access issues based on environmental barriers. In general, our focus is primarily treatment and not prevention. In many way s people are rewarded for being ill, as ours is a very reactive system: prevention is no t always covered by insurance but if someone is ill enough to present in the emergency r oom the hospital has to treat them. Most drugs on the market are also reactive: take th is pill and it will treat your disease. However, because all of the commercials have both a prevention and disruption message, the marketing approach is logical. The dis ruption theme allows the drug companies to \"prescribe\" a fix to the problem of ce rvical cancer \"drawing upon familiar types and formats\" (Fairclough, 1995, 56) and adher ing closely to the organizational properties of advertising. Even though the product is a vaccine that is preventative, the commercials still frame cervical cancer as a proble m, something that disrupts the lives of young women; therefore the vaccine \"prevents the disruption\" of cervical cancer. The distinction between treatment and prevention is oft en blurred in the public discourse about health. These ads perpetuate this haze by tur ning a prevention message into a treatment message, a framing that both drug compani es and consumers are far more comfortable and familiar with, making even the seem ingly creative ads fairly normative. 83 Unfortunately, reinforcing the confusion between pr evention and treatment may result in people using the vaccine incorrectly expecting it t o treat the HPV they already have. b. Fueling fear The second overarching theme is the obvious down playing of HPV in favor of highlighting cervical cancer. The typic al discourse around STIs is vastly different than that of cancer. Having an STI denote s something about the moral fiber of the person; it's stigmatizing (Goffman, 1963). Some times the discourse around STIs even suggests that whoever has one somehow deserves it by labeling the person (primarily a woman) a \"whore\" or \"slut.\" Some adver tising for herpes medication reflects this stigma by having people in the ads whisper abo ut their diagnosis but also show the same individuals enjoying their lives in happy part nerships in an effort to conceal their status. Having cancer, on the other hand, elicits s ympathy and feelings of \"unfairness.\" There is nothing you can do to prevent it. It can h appen to anyone. No one deserves it. Because of this discourse alone, framing the vaccin e as preventing cancer makes sense. However, by downplaying HPV these ads necess arily ignore all pertinent information about the virus (like transmission, ris k factors, transience, and genital warts) in favor of cancer, painting a rather bleak and oft en unrealistic picture of long-term outcomes, prevention, and prevalence. Ultimately, b y highlighting cervical cancer, these ads intentionally fuel the fear that the very word ignites. Downplaying the fact that cervical cancer is caused by an STI essentially precludes any of the ads from addressing HPV transm ission, risk factors, and prevalence. While many of the ads note that cervica l cancer is caused by HPV, none of 84 them explicitly say how someone can get HPV in the first place: through sexual contact. Only one ad even hints at this fact. In Merck's \"Wh at If\" commercial, an ad exploring life's possibilities, the narrator asks \"what if yo u meet someone? What if he likes you too? What if he gives you HPV? What if it doesn't g o away?\" This language makes it clear that HPV is communicable and that you can get it from your partner but never actually says that it is a sexually transmitted inf ection. This omission shrouds transmission in mystery thus increasing fear about getting cancer: can it just come out of nowhere? Is it \"closer than you know\" like the c ommercials state? Similarly, there is no mention of risk factors for cervical cancer. As all cervical cancer is caused by HPV, only people who are sexual ly active are at risk and even among those who are sexually active, there are diff erent risk profiles for contracting HPV. Studies examining risk factors for HPV and cer vical cancer suggest that the more partners a person has the higher their risk of bein g exposed to HPV (Roteli-Martins et al., 2011). By framing the vaccine as preventing ce rvical cancer and downplaying HPV, the ads suggest that all women have the same risk o f developing cervical cancer and should harbor the same amount of fear. By focusing on one possible outcome of HPV, and not the virus itself, the ads do not address its prevalence or transience, which may mitigate anxiety about cervical cancer. Instead of noting the fact that most sexual ly active people will be exposed to HPV at some time in their lives and that it typical ly goes away on its own, the ads fuel the fear of cancer by focusing on extreme long-term outcomes of not getting the vaccine. At least one ad from each company suggests that there is a strong chance that if you get cervical cancer you won't be able to hav e children. Merck's \"What If\" ad asks 85 the audience: \"what if years later your HPV turns i nto cervical cancer? What if you have to have surgery to remove it? What if you might not be able to have kids? What if you got really, really sick?\" This line of questioning is accompanied by images of surgical implements, adorable babies, and a woman who has lo st her hair sitting in a chemo chair. One of the ads from GSK bolsters this idea b y letting the audience in on a phone discussion between two friends about their mutual f riend Kate and her recent cervical cancer diagnosis. The setting is visually bleak, in dicating the seriousness of the situation. The viewer only sees one of the friends on the phone. She is standing outside on the front porch in a sweater on a gray and snowy day as she whispers into the phone that Kate \"thinks she might not be able to have kid s\" to which the second friend exclaims \"but she's only 25!\" This exchange is the main text of the commercial, obviously explaining to the audience that young wom en who get cervical cancer will likely have their dreams of having a family crushed . Moreover, these ads not only suggest that HPV and/or cervical cancer can cause i nfertility but that the progression from one to the other is quick. Both implications a re misleading. Neither HPV nor cervical cancer can directly cause infertility. If a persistent HPV infection eventually develops into cervical cancer, it will likely requi re treatment. There are several options for treating cervical cancer depending on the stage of the disease. One of the treatment options is a hysterectomy. If a woman has a hystere ctomy then she will no longer be able to bear children. Further, both ads show young women being diagnosed with cervical cancer. While young women certainly can an d do develop cervical cancer, these ads make it seem like women in their twenties are the majority of cervical cancer incidence. However, SEER data suggest that from 200 3 -2007 most cases of cervical 86 cancer were diagnosed in women between the ages of 35 and 44 years old and that the median age of diagnosis was 48. In order to promote the vaccine as primary prevent ion for cervical cancer, these commercials gloss over some key facts about early d etection and screening for cervical cancer as well. Many of the normative commercials n ote that continuing regular cervical cancer screening is important but they never tell t he audience why: A Pap test, not the vaccine, is primary prevention for cervical cancer. The vaccine is primary prevention for HPV infection that can lead to cancer. Early detect ion and screening is extremely important because cervical cancer is very slow grow ing and highly treatable if found early. Often, Pap tests alert healthcare profession als and patients to abnormal cells that are precursors to cancer, and not cancer itself. Th e earlier abnormal cells are identified, the easier it is to remove them and stop them from developing into cancer. Even if a follow-up to a Pap test shows that cell abnormaliti es are cancerous, the earlier the cancer is detected the higher the survival rate. By focusing on the vaccine as primary prevention, these ads contribute to the growing pub lic confusion about screening guidelines and recommendations, raising its salienc e and making it seem like the only way to protect oneself against cervical cancer. Finally, while many of these commercials use incide nce and mortality rates of cervical cancer to frame the issue, they avoid disc ussion of the true prevalence of cervical cancer compared to other cancers, and the fact that cervical cancer is not the only possible outcome of HPV. Without knowing anyth ing else about cervical cancer, watching these commercials could be terrifying, whi ch, as discussed, is likely the purpose. Most of them show the same statistics, \"ev ery 47 minutes another woman is 87 diagnosed with cervical cancer\" and \"each year thou sands of women learn they have cervical cancer.\" While these statistics are true, the ads decontextualize them: Is that a lot of women compared to other cancers? Is cervical cancer a significant cause of death for all women in the United States? The answer to b oth of these questions is no, though it is not offered by the ads. Cervical cancer is di agnosed far less often than breast, lung, colon, or ovarian cancers, as well as many others. This low incidence rate is largely because of screening and early detection efforts in the United States, something downplayed in the ads. While the most recent projec tions suggest that a little more than 4,200 women died from cervical cancer in 2010 (SEER , 2010), this figure is far lower than that of other causes of death. Even when this number is compared to other cancers, cervical cancer mortality is still quite l ow in the United States. Beyond failing to put cervical cancer statistics i nto context, these ads also neglect to mention all of the possible outcomes of HPV. Because these ads focus exclusively on cervical cancer prevention they fail to mention other site-specific cancers, all of which can be caused by the same two strains of HPV the vaccine protects against. In addition, HPV can cause genital warts; however, as genital warts are inextricably linked to an STI, mentioning this possible outcome would only serve to remind (or alert) the audience to the fact that HPV is sexually trans mitted. In several of the normative commercials, the audience is told that the vaccine can protect against \"other HPV diseases\" but those are never enumerated. Finally, while HPV can lead to several unfortunate outcomes, most of the time the virus cl ears on its own and goes away without ever being noticed. Only one commercial ack nowledges this fact. 88 While it makes marketing sense for the vaccines to be framed as preventing cervical cancer, in doing so the drug companies onl y highlight one potential outcome of HPV. This framing avoids discussion of HPV, prevent ing the commercials from addressing what causes cervical cancer, how someone can get it, who is most at risk, and how common it is, all of which would potentiall y mitigate the fear of cervical cancer. As it stands, the tone and frame of the ads maximiz e the perceived severity and susceptibility by decontextualizing prevalence rate s and focusing on extreme sequelae thus fueling the fear of cancer. c. The face of the vaccine By and large, all of these commercials suggest t hat anyone can get cervical cancer. This is actually true. Any woman can get cervical cancer. However, the reality of who actually gets cervical cancer, and later, who dies from cervical cancer is not reflected in the faces shown in these commercia ls. While many of the HPV vaccine commercials highlight women and girls of various ra ces and ethnicities, the majority of the women featured in these ads are White. Off scre en, however, cervical cancer actually affects a disproportionate number of Black and Hispanic women. The data from SEER (2010) show that Hispanic women have the highe st incidence rates of cervical cancer (12 cases per 100,000 women) followed by Bla ck women (10 per 100,000 women). This means that these two groups are diagno sed with cervical cancer most often. The rates for Black and Hispanic women are m uch higher than rates for all women combined (8 per 100,000). Looking specificall y at mortality rates, Black women have the highest rate of death from cervical cancer at 4.4 deaths per 100,000 women, 89 almost double the rate of all women (2.4 per 100,00 0). This rate is also twice that of White and Asian/Pacific Islander women (2.2 and 2.1 respectively). While these data suggest that there are significant health dispariti es when it comes to cervical cancer, they are not reflected in the advertisements. Looki ng at the commercials alone, one could assume that cervical cancer mostly affects Wh ite women, thus the panoply of White faces in the ads. The question remains, why d on't the images of women and girls in these commercials match the faces of those who a re actually at highest risk? One likely explanation for this is that White women and girls are actually the target audience for these commercials because this group is more li kely to have a regular source of healthcare, get cancer screenings, and receive chil dhood or routine vaccinations than other groups (Agency for Healthcare Research and Qu ality, 2013; Kaiser Family Foundation, 2012). Because of this, White women are more likely to actually talk to their healthcare provider about the vaccine as well as re ceive it. Therefore, these ads seem to be targeted at those who are most likely to get the vaccine, and not necessarily a diagnosis of cervical cancer. Another, perhaps more generous, explanation for th is misalignment is that Merck and GSK were afraid of stigmatizing groups who have higher rates of cervical cancer and therefore focused on a group (White women and g irls) who are less often affected. This explanation is consistent with the literature that suggests stigma can be perpetuated in the media when those portrayed as ha ving a condition or being at risk for a disease are representative of those who are stere otypically known for the condition (Wang, 1998). However, this explanation seems less plausible when applied to cervical 90 cancer, which is not historically a stigmatized con dition. If the ads had focused more on HPV, this argument would be more persuasive. d. Where the boys are: the feminine frame Watching these ads it is pretty clear where the boys are: they are almost nowhere to be found. These commercials take on a feminine frame, one that very nearly excludes men and boys from the narrativ e entirely. All of the normative ads show young women as strong and in control of their lives: they choose to be \"one less woman affected by cervical cancer,\" \"one less stati stic\"; they choose to get vaccinated, or their mothers choose to get them vaccinated. The women and girls featured in these ads are active and happy. They play sports, pursue hobbies, bond with their mothers, and support each other. Even in the creative commer cials, women are strong, supportive, and independent. The absence of men ind icates that women do not need men to tell them what to do, to support them, or to help them. The HPV vaccine gives women, girls, and mothers the power of prevention, or at least the opportunity to talk to their doctor. This approach is very reminiscent of those utilitized by pharmaceutical companies to market other sexual health products, a s empowerment is a central theme in direct-to-consumer advertising for herpes treatm ent prescriptions and erectile dysfunction medication. Only one commercial prominently features men. Merc k's \"What If\" commercial shows several different men: four boyfriends who ha ve given their partners HPV (which later turns into cervical cancer), and the surgeon who helps to remove the cancer. Interestingly, this commercial has darker, more mas culine tones than some of the other 91 ads. The ad begins with a comfortable pace, upbeat music, and light colors. It is previewing what one's life could be like \"if.\" As t he ad progresses, however, and the \"what if\" becomes meeting a guy, the music becomes more serious, the cadence quicker, and the colors darker. The inclusion of me n in this commercial is important and striking; however, even though they are included in this ad, they appear in the female narrative almost as interlopers, the person who gav e the promising young women HPV and eventually cervical cancer. They also shatter t heir dreams of having adorable babies. They are there to support them after they g ive them HPV, but they slowly disappear after the cervical cancer diagnosis. By t he time the viewer sees a woman having chemotherapy she is all alone. The subtext i s abundantly clear: cervical cancer takes everything away and women are left to fight o n their own. Therefore, the inclusion of men in this ad leaves the audience wondering wha t their role really is or should be. So what does this lack of maleness say about HPV a nd cervical cancer? One could derive from these texts that cervical cancer is a female-only issue and that because men do not have cervixes, they aren't invol ved in or even aware of the realities of cervical cancer. The lack of maleness in these c ommercials essentially suggests that men should not and do not have a place in this narr ative. When maleness is inserted into the narrative the connotation is negative. Ano ther interpretation of the exclusion of men from these ads is that women alone should carry the burden of protecting themselves against HPV and cervical cancer. Women a re the ones who get HPV and they are the ones who will suffer the consequences if it turns into cervical cancer. However, both of these readings are incorrect: men absolutely have a role in this narrative. They can contract HPV and give it to the ir partners, as the \"What If\" 92 commercial implies, but they can also support their partners, daughters, mothers, sisters, and friends who may be diagnosed with cerv ical cancer. Excluding men from the overall narrative is problematic, not just beca use it downplays the fact that men get HPV (which can lead to anal, penile, and head and n eck cancer, as well as genital warts) and that they can pass it to their partners, but because the HPV vaccine is now routinely recommended for males, which means they h ave a significant role to play in protecting themselves and their partners against HP V and, by extension, several types of cancer and genital warts. To be fair, these ads were created before boys and young men were able to get the HPV vaccine; however, the lengths to which these ads go to exclude men is significant regardless of whether ma les can get the vaccine or not. This lack of maleness certainly reflects prevailing ideas about the fairer sex being responsible for their own sexual and reproductive h ealth, with little to no contribution from their opposite-sex partners. In these ads, wom en are empowered to \"choose to be one less\" but they are also disempowered as they al one carry the burden of protection. Men are mostly absent from the narrative and when t hey are included they give the women HPV and slowly disappear from view as the pro gnosis gets worse. Perhaps including males in these ads would have been contro versial, something the marketing is desperately trying to avoid. It's hard to sell some thing that challenges social norms. However, perhaps showing more male faces in these a ds would have suggested that when the vaccine was approved for boys and young me n it was important for them to get it, not only to protect themselves but for thei r partners too. One has to wonder if Merck has painted themselves into a proverbial corn er with this narrative and how it has affected male uptake of their vaccine. 93 5. Conclusions All media messages are framed. Framing helps the a udience know what is important and relevant. In reviewing the HPV vaccin e commercials for Gardasil and Cervarix, four overarching themes were evident, hel ping us understand their orientation beyond their cervical cancer-prevention framing. Co llectively, these themes all target perceived susceptibility of cervical cancer by high lighting that all women are at risk. Only half of the themes rely on perceived severity (Prevention and Disruption and Fueling Fear); self-efficacy (Prevention and Disrup tion and Where the Boys Are); and perceived norms (The Face of the HPV Vaccine and Wh ere the Boys Are) to reach the audience. Not surprisingly, these ads downplay perc eived barriers of getting the vaccine as a way to increase audience's perceived self-effi cacy and generally make the idea of purchasing this vaccine easy and accessible. Taken together, these themes largely reflect how society views sexual health: a female b urden that is best discussed with hushed tones and knowing nods and often results in a punishment, in this case, cervical cancer. By framing the HPV vaccine as cervical canc er these ads highlight the benefits of vaccine receipt for girls and young women and do wnplay any information about its sexual transmission, all in an effort to present th eir product in a tidy package that any consumer would eagerly purchase. Future research in this area should focus on how t his media framing affects the vaccine-eligible population's understanding of cerv ical cancer and HPV. In order to understand this issue in-depth, it would be interes ting to show these ads in a series of focus groups of vaccine-eligible males and females (ages 15 -26) and parents of vaccine-eligible girls and boys (ages 11 -17). These focus groups could explore the four 94 themes identified in this discourse analysis regard ing what the ads communicate about cervical cancer and HPV, what information they felt was noticeably missing, who is most at risk for cervical cancer, and what role, if any, men and boys play in this issue. Further, focus groups could help explore how future ads and media coverage of the vaccine can help improve knowledge and underlying b eliefs about HPV and cancer prevention. 95 B. Manuscript 2: \"Clarity or Confusion: What Do Pare nts and Young People Learn from Human Papillomavirus Vaccine Ads ?\" 1. Summary The Human Papillomavirus (HPV) is the most common STI in the United States. There are two vaccines that help prevent tw o strains responsible for the majority of HPV-associated cancer. One vaccine also protects against two additional strains that cause almost all genital warts. Knowledge about HPV and its sequelae has increased considerably since the introduction of the first va ccine in 2006. Several studies have found that direct-to-consumer ads are the biggest s ource of information about HPV and the vaccine in the United States; however, little r esearch has been conducted to examine what the target audience learns from these ads. This study used a mixed- methods approach to explore how vaccine decision-ma ker knowledge changes as a result of watching eight direct-to-consumer ads. Qu alitative and quantitative methods were integrated to more comprehensively understand knowledge change among this population. Findings suggest that watching ads did result in changes in knowledge, but whether it provided greater clarity or greater conf usion depended on baseline knowledge. 2. Background a. Human papillomavirus With approximately 79 million people currently in fected, HPV is the most common STI in the United States (Satterwhite e t al., 2013). It is easily transmitted through direct skin-to-skin contact during vaginal, oral, and anal intercourse. Although 96 90% of HPV infections clear on their own within two years, some persistent cases can lead to various types of cancer and genital warts. The cervix is the most common site of cancer associated with HPV but the virus can lead t o vaginal, vulvar, anal, penile, and oropharyngeal cancers as well. In addition, HPV cau ses for all cases of genital warts and nearly all cases of cervical and anal cancer. T wo vaccines on the market can help protect against several common strains of the virus . b. The vaccines In 2006, the FDA approved the first HPV vaccine i n the United States. Merck's Gardasil protects against HPV 6 and 11, two strains that cause 90% of genital warts and HPV 16 and 18, two strains that c ause the majority of cervical and anal cancer and nearly half of all vaginal, vulvar, and penile cancer. While Gardasil can be started as early as nine years old per physician discretion, it is recommended for females and males ages 11 -12 in order to vaccinate before sexual debut. The A CIP also recommends that females ages 13 -26 and males ages 13 -21 receive the complete vaccine series. While men ages 22 -26 are licensed to receive the vaccine, ACIP did no t find a recommendation for this group to be cost eff ective (CDC, 2011). In fall 2009, a second vaccine, GSK's Cervarix was approved by the FDA. Cervarix protects against two strains of HPV, 16 and 18, and is recommended f or routine vaccination in girls ages 11 -12 and as a catch-up vaccination for females ages 1 3 -26 (CDC, 2010). Cervarix is not currently licensed for males. 97 c. Sources of information and knowledge Prior to the approval of a vaccine, knowledge ab out HPV was quite low (Tiro et al., 2007). In the last few years, how ever, awareness of and knowledge about HPV and the vaccine has increased (Hughes et al., 2009; Sandfort and Pleasant, 2009). Various studies have found that pharmaceutic al ads were the most-often cited information source among vaccine-eligible males and females as well as parents of vaccine-eligible youth (Katz et al., 2011; Cates et al., 2010; Hughes et al., 2009; Caskey et al., 2009). A recent study suggested that awaren ess of HPV was higher in the United States than in the United Kingdom or Australia, lik ely because of the ubiquity of pharmaceutical ads (Marlow, 2013). Looking at knowl edge of HPV and sources of information, Almeida et al. (2012) found that vacci ne-eligible women and parents who reported advertisements as their only source of inf ormation had lower knowledge of HPV than those who cited getting information from n on-advertisements or advertisements plus another source. Groups that rep orted only getting information from ads were less likely to have received or intend to receive the vaccine, suggesting that the most utilized source of information may contrib ute to awareness but not knowledge or uptake. d. Purpose of study Though recent studies have shown that advertiseme nts are the most commonly cited source about HPV, at the time o f this writing, only one published study (Leader et al., 2011) had examined audience r eactions to these HPV vaccine 98 direct-to-consumer ads. The present study seeks to address this gap in the literature by exploring the following research question: how do T V ads change knowledge about HPV and the HPV vaccine? 3. Methods This study uses a mixed-methods approach involving survey questions and focus-group interviews to examine participants' understanding of HPV and the HPV vaccine before and after viewing eight HPV vaccine direct-to-consumer ads. Participants were males and females age 15 -26 (vaccine-eligibles) and parents of 11 - 17 year olds. The particular style of method mixing is known as a parallel/simultaneous mixed-method design (Figure 4), meaning that \"the q uantitative and qualitative data are collected at the same time and analyzed in a comple mentary manner\" (Tashakkori and Teddlie, 1998, 47). This approach is useful when in tegrating convergent results in order to develop a more complete understanding of a pheno menon, as in the present study. It differs from other mixed-methods designs in that da ta are collected in a single-phase study and both methods are equally valued. Figure 5 illustrates the procedures used to collect the data. a. Sample and recruitment This study used a purposive sample of vaccine de cision-makers: males and females ages 15 -26 and parents of males and females ages 11 -17. A total of 45 people participated in 12 focus groups held b etween October 2012 and December 99 2012. Groups were stratified by age (11 -12, 13 -14, 15 -17, 18 -21, 22 -26), sex of vaccine-eligible (male, female), and decision-maker role (parent, vaccine eligible). Six parent groups (n=15) included 10 mothers (3 discuss ing sons, 7 discussing daughters) and 5 fathers (3 discussing sons, 2 discussing daug hters). The other six sessions consisted of vaccine-eligibles: males and females a ges 15 -26 (n=30). Only two vaccine- eligibles had parents who also participated in focu s groups. Participants were initially recruited online through virtual message boards and word-of-mouth. Interested participants called or emailed research personnel a nd were screened for eligibility as part of the recruitment process. Interested partici pants who met the inclusion criteria were enrolled into the appropriate focus group. All enrolled participants were sent information sheets by email or mail prior to the fo cus-group meeting. All recruitment materials were approved by the UIC Institutional Re view Board. Informed consent was obtained from each participan t age 18 and over upon arrival for the focus group. Assent was obtained fr om participants ages 15 -17. Parental permission was also obtained for participants ages 15 -17. Each session was audio- recorded and transcribed. All participants were giv en a $20 gift card after the 90-minute focus-group session. b. Focus groups Twelve focus groups were conducted in Chicago, Il linois either at the UIC School of Public Health (n=11) or a communi ty-based organization (n=1). The same moderator and research assistant facilitated a ll focus groups. A separate but 100 similar discussion guide was used for parents and v accine-eligible groups. After discussing previous knowledge of HPV and the HPV va ccine (\"pre-ad discussion\") participants were asked to watch eight vaccine ads (Table III). Two groups (males and females aged 15 -17) were unable to watch one of the ads (\"Music Vid eo\") because of technical difficulties. Ads were shown consecutivel y without discussion in between. Participants discussed their reactions to the ads i ncluding what they learned about HPV and the HPV vaccine (\"post-ad discussion\"). Ads wer e selected from those publicly available on YouTube. After the post-ad discussion, the moderator provided factual information about topics discussed and answered par ticipant questions (\"fact reveal\"). c. Pre/post survey Participants were asked to complete a brief, anon ymous, self- administered, pen-and-paper survey before the discu ssion began (\"pre-survey\") and directly after watching the HPV vaccine ads (\"post- survey\"). Pre-questionnaires gathered data about knowledge of HPV and the HPV va ccine and vaccine receipt. Post- questionnaires contained the same knowledge questio ns but also asked about reasons for vaccination/non-vaccination, plans for future v accination, and demographics. d. Data analysis Parallel analysis of two types of data (qualitati ve and quantitative) provides a richer understanding of the study variab les and their relationships 101 (Tashakkori and Teddlie, 1998). In the present stud y, qualitative and quantitative data were initially analyzed separately, as described be low, then integrated and synthesized. i. Qualitative data Based on established methods of qualitative rese arch, data analysis began immediately after each focus group w ith a meeting between the moderator and notetaker to debrief the discussion. Additionally, the moderator and notetaker wrote up their individual notes and obser vations after each session (C\u00f4t\u00e9- Arsenault and Morrison-Beedy, 2005). Audio recordin gs were transcribed verbatim by a professional transcription service. Transcripts wer e reviewed by the moderator and uploaded to Atlas/TI, a qualitative data analysis p rogram (Muhr, 2012). A coding guide was developed based on the focus-gro up session format and helped categorize data into pre- and post-ad discus sion as well as topic. All transcripts were coded in Atlas/TI by a research assistant (\"co der\") in accordance with this coding guide. After coding one transcript, the coder met w ith the moderator to discuss issues encountered and suggest changes to the coding guide . The coding guide went through four versions and was amended after several rounds of coding. After all transcripts were coded by the primary coder, the moderator coded a 1 0% subsample of the transcripts as an inter-rater reliability check yielding an 80% agreement. All discrepancies were examined by the moderator who made the final decisi on as to which code was accurately applied. 102 Theme generation began during the post-session debr iefs and continued through the coding process. Quotes that corresponded with p re-ad discussions were assigned pre-knowledge codes; those relating to discussion a fter watching the ads were coded as post-knowledge. All pre-ad codes were examined toge ther and explored for themes about what focus-group participants knew before wat ching the ads. Quotes about pre- ad HPV knowledge were coded separately from pre-ad vaccine knowledge. Themes about what participants as a whole knew about HPV a nd the HPV vaccine before watching the ads were documented. At this point, ea ch case (one focus group) was examined to see the variability and commonalities a cross groups. The same process was used to examine the post-ad codes. After both p re-ad and post-ad codes were examined separately, they were compared to see how knowledge had changed before and after watching the ads. ii. Quantitative data Surveys were administered before and after parti cipants watched the eight HPV vaccine ads. All data were en tered into Excel for cleaning and coding. Descriptive statistics were calculated in E xcel to summarize the sample. To check the normality of the distribution, a Shapiro- Wilks test was conducted. Because the pre- and post-data were normally distributed, a paired t test was used to analyze total knowledge change by participant. McNemar's te st was used to calculate pre- and post-knowledge change by survey question. Significa nce level was set at p<.05. All data were analyzed using Stata 11.0. 103 4. Results Across all participants, the vast majority had hea rd of HPV (91%) and the vaccine (84%) prior to attending the focus group or interview. Vaccine uptake among participants was not nearly as high. Of those who h ad heard of the HPV vaccine, only 33% reported getting at least one dose for themselv es or their child. Only female participants and mothers of girls reported having g otten it for themselves or their children. Almost two-thirds of respondents had seen a TV ad for the HPV vaccine prior to the focus group. Participant characteristics are summarized in Table VI. Qualitative and quantitative data findings are synthesized belo w. 104 TABLE VI FOCUS-GROUP PARTICIPANT CHARACTERISTICS Parents (n=15) Vaccine Eligible (n=30) Total (n=45) Sex Females 10 67% 20 67% Males 33% 3 16% 3 10 29% 3 3 13% Other 0 0% 1 3% 1 2% Education Less than 8th 0 0% 0 0% 0 0% Some high school 0 0% 10 33% 10 22% High school degree/GED 3 20% 7% 11% Some college 7 47% 8 27% 15 33% 2 year college degree 0 0% 1 3% 1 2% 4 year college degree or higher 5 33% 9 30% 14 31% Previous exposure Heard of HPV 15 100% 26 87% 41 91% Heard of HPV vaccine 12 80% 26 87% 38 84% Received at least 1 dose of HPV vaccine 3 20% 12 40% 15 33% Received complete HPV vaccine series 2 13% 7 23% 9 20% 105 a. Baseline knowledge In the focus-group discussions, participants ofte n had difficulty articulating what they knew about HPV and the HPV v accine. Knowledge and ability to discuss HPV and the HPV vaccine varied greatly by g roup and often by individual participants within groups. One participant explain ed his knowledge as \"very vague . . . sort of background noise,\" which aptly described ot her groups' knowledge as well. Table VII shows what respondents knew before watching the ads. i. Human papillomavirus While almost all participants seemed to know how HPV was transmitted, they often lacked confidence in their answers: \"it's classified as an STD, right?\" or \"VD or herpes or syphilis. Like that. Th at's what pops in my mind.\" Although their confidence may have been low in discussion, s urvey data reveal that 98% of participants accurately knew how HPV was transmitte d prior to viewing the ads. While knowledge that females could get HPV was universal, far fewer were aware that males could also contract the virus. Many participants wh o thought that boys and men could get HPV also noted that it was \"asymptomatic\" in ma les or that it \"can be transmitted by either sex but . . . [the] health consequences wou ld be felt by women and not men.\" Both survey and focus-group data gathered before pa rticipants viewed the ads indicate that participants saw HPV as quite common. In the surveys only 13% thought that HPV was \"not very common,\" and in pre-ad focus -group discussions the vast majority of respondents described HPV as \"very comm on.\" However, further probing 106 suggested that \"very common\" had many definitions, from \"top five sexually transmitted infections\" to \"like 80% of sexually active people or something have it\" to \"70-something [%]\" to \"like more than a quarter of the population .\" Beyond definitions of \"very common,\" several groups mentioned they thought HPV was \"on the rise\" because more and more people, including their doctors, seemed to be talking about it. The connection between HPV and cervical cancer seem ed to be common knowledge in pre-ad discussions, aligning with pre- test data (98% of respondents accurately answered a question about HPV causing ce rvical). However, knowledge about other types of cancer was less common. Less t han half of respondents reported that HPV could cause \"many types\" of cancer on the pre-survey and even fewer were able to identify a non-cervical type. About half th e groups seemed to know that HPV was associated with genital warts or \"some sort of sore.\" Complementing this finding, survey data revealed that 64% of participants thoug ht that HPV could cause genital warts prior to viewing ads in the session. ii. The vaccine When asked to explain what they had heard about the vaccine, several people commented on the number of shots in the series (three), the company who created one of the vaccines (Merck) or the name of one vaccine (Gardasil). They also recalled seeing ads for an HP V vaccine or having discussed it with their physicians. Specific knowledge of the vaccine appeared to be the result of having had the vaccine or having discussed it with a healt hcare provider in the past. 107 Of the nine questions asked at baseline, only one was discussed in focus groups: who is eligible for the HPV vaccine. Survey data revealed that 80% of participants thought that both males and females co uld get the vaccine; however, discussions revealed uncertainty on this point. Kno wledge about age range also varied. Some reflected on their own age group or that of th eir child by hazarding a guess of \"maybe puberty age,\" \"teenagers, 3 and \"nobody under 16.\" Others offered thoughts on age-range eligibility ba sed on what their doctor had told them about their own eligibility or gave estimates based on more general awareness that \"they want you to get it before you are sexual ly active.\" Still others gave extreme estimates like age \"16 to 90\" or indicated that the re wasn't an age restriction at all. 108 TABLE VII FOCUS-GROUP KNOWLEDGE BEFORE AND AFTER WATCHING HPV VACCINE ADS Pre Correct Post Correct Difference P value^ Knowledge # (%) # (%) # (%) HPV Can be transmitted through oral, anal, and vaginal sex [TRUE] 43 (96) 45 (100) 2 (4) 0.500 Is not very common [FALSE] 39 (87) 43 (96) 4 (9) 0. 289 Can be treated with antibiotics [FALSE] 26 (58) 26 (58) 0 (0) 1.000 Can cause cervical cancer [TRUE] 44 (98) 44 (98) 0 (0) 1.000 Can cause many types of cancer [TRUE] 20 (44) 23 (51) 3 (7) 0.648 Can cause genital warts [TRUE] 29 (64) 28 (62) -1 ( -2) 1.000 Only females can get HPV [FALSE] 30 (67) 32 (71) 2 (4) 0.791 If a woman has a normal Pap smear she doesn't have HPV [FALSE] 33 (73) 38 (84) 5 (11) 0.179 HPV Vaccine Can prevent cervical cancer [TRUE] 26 (58) 35 (78) 9 (20) 0.049* Prevents against all types of HPV [FALSE] 21 (47) 35 (78) 14 (31) 0.004* Both males and females can get the HPV vaccine [TRUE] 36 (80) 27 (60) -9 (-20) 0.049* Can cause cervical cancer [FALSE] 30 (67) 35 (78) 5 (11) 0.302 Can cause HPV [FALSE] 37 (82) 40 (89) 3 (7) 0.508 People who are vaccinated no longer have to use condoms [FALSE] 44 (98) 44 (98) 0 (0) 1.000 Lasts forever [FALSE] 31 (69) 31 (69) 0 (0) 1.000 If a woman gets the HPV vaccine she still must get a regular pelvic exam and Pap smear [TRUE] 23 (51) 42(93) 21 (42) 0.000* Mean Total Correct Score 12.1 (66.6) 13.4 (74.4) 1.3 (7.7) 0.001* + *Statistical significance at p <.05. ^McNemar p value (exact test used when sample <5). + Paired t test. 109 b. Post-knowledge Table VII shows knowledge change after watching t he HPV vaccine ads. Overall knowledge (change in mean score of cor rect responses) increased by almost 8% and was statistically significant (p=.001 ). Looking at knowledge change by individual question, participants seemed to learn m ore about the HPV vaccine than the virus itself. i. Human papillomavirus Although not statically significant, there was s ome HPV knowledge change after viewing the ads. Most partic ipants knew that HPV was sexually transmitted before viewing the ads but many were co nfused afterward about why the ads didn't explicitly mention this fact. As one fat her of a teenage son noted, \"they didn't really get into the depth of explaining exactly how it's transmitted.\" Most participants agreed that only one of the ads \"hinted\" that HPV w as sexually transmissible but that \"they didn't really come out and say anything.\" Sim ilarly the vast majority agreed that one ad suggested that HPV was an STI because it sai d \"something like what if you find a guy and what if he gives you HPV.\" As another par ticipant joked, \"you can't just like give it to [a girl]. Like, here's a box with HPV in it\" so it must be spread through sex. Other groups noted that it \"just broadly\" confirmed their previous knowledge about transmission, and that there was \"nothing more spec ific than that about what type of sexual activity.\" 110 Many participants were confused about where HPV \"co mes from\" and whether sex was the only mode of transmission. After viewin g the ads participants across several groups felt that while HPV was sexually tra nsmissible it could also be hereditary or \"something that just happens.\" As one mother of a young daughter noted, \"I think you can get it like you get breast cancer . . . . It j ust seems like it. I don't know. Because basically . . . the majority of the commercials are telling you to just be safe. You can prevent it. You know what I mean? There's only one [ad] that was sexual.\" However, despite this confusion, the post-test survey reveal ed that 100% of respondents (up from 96% before the ads) thought HPV was sexually transm itted after viewing the ads. For some, the ads seemed to reinforce the notion th at males can get HPV but that it doesn't necessarily affect them. As one par ticipant noted, men \"don't have any . . . there's no side effects. It doesn't really affect them unless, yeah. And then they give it to their partner and they're like, oh, sorry. Yeah. I didn't know. There's no way to screen me. So. Sorry.\" Similarly, a mother of a teenage so n noted that \"boys won't get cervical cancer from HPV [but can get] vaccinated so that wh en they become sexually active they won't give it to a partner.\" Others indicated that they \"didn't know that men get it\" while still others pondered the question \"so if guy s can give it to girls that must mean that guys have it?\" Knowledge about cervical cancer remained the same ( 98% pre-post) but the post-ad discussion revealed that those who were unc lear about the connection between HPV and cervical cancer became more confident in th eir knowledge. As one mother noted, \"HPV leads to cervical cancer. That's what I understood. That's the confusion 111 that I had, that I didn't know whether these are re lated or not. But from [the ads], I understood that cervical cancer happens from one of the HPVs.\" While the ads seemed to reinforce the idea that there is a relationship between HPV and cervical cancer, details about the connection were not always clear: \"HPV is just so open-ended [in the ads]. They just want you to jump automatically to t hink about cervical cancer.\" Cervical cancer was the primary HPV-related outcome mentioned in the post-ad discussion. Genital warts and other cancers were on ly brought up in the post-ad discussion to express confusion based on previous k nowledge. As a mother of a teenage daughter explained after watching the ads, \"I kind of had a question mark like, okay, what are the other things that [HPV] causes? I didn't know if it was genital warts or what else.\" To that end, survey data showed a sl ight dip (2% decrease) in knowledge about genital warts after watching the ads. Despite the lack of discussion about other cancers, survey data show that knowledge about othe r types of HPV-related cancer increased, although not significantly. Finally, dis cussions revealed that the ads may have inaccurately introduced the idea that infertil ity is a possible outcome of HPV. While this was not discussed in the pre-ad session, many respondents noted that the ads informed them that women \"might not be able to have kids\" or could become \"barren\" as a result of HPV. Survey data indicate there was an increase in knowl edge about HPV prevalence after watching the ads. This is an interesting find ing as the ads themselves do not mention HPV prevalence. When asked how common they thought HPV was, many participants cited statistics about cervical cancer in post-ad discussions suggesting that 112 they may have been confused by the incidence rates given in the ads. One mother of an adolescent son noted that the ads \"said something a bout . . . oh goodness. Everyday 30 women find out they have HPV . . . it seems like a lot. I mean, less than, you know, more than once an hour, somebody finds out they hav e it. You know?\" Several groups recognized their confusion and admitted not being a ble to remember if the statistics in the ads were about cervical cancer or HPV. Only one group, females ages 22 -26, clearly remembered that the incidence rates present ed were for cervical cancer while lamenting the fact that HPV is \"really really commo n\" but the ads \"just talked about, like, the percentages of women with cervical cancer.\" ii. The vaccine The post-survey data indicate that the ads influ enced knowledge about several aspects of the vaccine. The most significant change in knowledge was about the need to continue annual pap smears and pelvic exams after receiving the HPV vaccine (42% increase, p <.001). As one mother of a teenage daughter reflected, \"I liked the [ad] where the lad y said . . . you still have to have your annual pap smears. So that . . . I think that was v ery good information so that people didn't walk away thinking that I [got the vaccine] once or three times and now I'm just good to go.\" Similarly, knowledge about the vaccine not preventing all types of HPV also increased (31% increase, p <.001). Recall of this d etail was evident across all of the focus groups as people explained that the vaccine \" only prevents certain types\" of HPV and that \"it's not always a sure thing; that it's n ot going to totally prevent it.\" Finally, 113 there was a significant increase in knowledge about the vaccine protecting against cervical cancer (20% increase, p=.049). After watching the ads, participants were able to i dentify the age range of those licensed to get the HPV vaccine and in many cases w ere able to recall that the information was in \"the fine print\" or that it was \"just a flash at the bottom.\" Participants were still very unclear as to whether only women co uld get it or if men could get it too. This confusion was evident in the post-survey data as knowledge about who could get the vaccine actually decreased after seeing the ads (20% decrease, p=.049) as well as in the post-ad discussion. Males (18 -21 and 22 -26) in particular expressed uncertainty about their eligibility status after watching the a ds noting that \"pretty much all of them make me want to get it. Cause if you can prevent so mething then, yeah, you should try to. My only thing is still can guys get [the vaccin e]?\" and \"I still don't know if get [the vaccine] or not . . . not from these commerci als. I learned that I can give [HPV] though and you better be afraid.\" Females (15 -17 and 18 -21) were also unclear about whether males could get the vaccine. Parents who kn ew that males could get the vaccine in the pre-ad discussion remained confident of this fact after watching the ads. 5. Discussion This study examines how TV ads change vaccine deci sion-maker knowledge both qualitatively and quantitatively. Us ing a mixed-methods design allowed me to answer the same research question from two di fferent approaches measuring specific knowledge change as well as examining the depth of that knowledge. 114 a. Knowledge change Participants were asked to watch eight direct-to- consumer ads about the HPV vaccine. The purpose of these ads is to promote and sell a pharmaceutical product, not raise awareness of a co mplicated STI. Therefore, not surprisingly, significant knowledge change was only seen on questions about the vaccine, not the virus. After watching the ads, kno wledge increased on three important aspects of the HPV vaccine: its potential to preven t cervical cancer, its inability to prevent all types of HPV, and the necessity for wom en to continue getting Pap smears and pelvic exams after vaccination. Post-ad discuss ions reflected these knowledge increases as participants openly discussed these to pics and confirmed that these messages were received. While knowledge seemed to increase on several impor tant features of the vaccine, knowledge about who could get the HPV vacc ine actually declined. In the pre- survey and pre-ad discussion, the majority of parti cipants correctly reported that both males and females could get the vaccine. After watc hing the ads, however, significantly fewer people understood this to be true. This trend makes sense given the context of the ads. First, while one of the vaccines (Gardasil ) is approved and even recommended for some males, the Merck ads were created during a time when males were not approved to get the HPV vaccine. Second, three of t he ads viewed were for Cervarix, a vaccine that is only available for females. This de crease in knowledge suggests that these ads were so specifically targeted that it con vinced respondents that only females were currently eligible to get the vaccine. This fi nding suggests that in order to 115 successfully reach male vaccine-eligibles, health e ducators and public-health professionals must try to undo some of the effects of this messaging and figure out ways to communicate not only male eligibility but r elevance as well. b. Knowledge confidence After watching the ads, the groups who knew a bit more in the pre- ad discussion (and those who noted learning about i t from a doctor in particular) seemed to be less confused after the ads, suggestin g the ads explicated a few concepts for them. In general, their previous knowledge of H PV and the HPV vaccine did not waver but they often had questions about why certai n details (like sexual transmission, timing of the vaccine, and male vaccination) were o mitted from the ads. This was particularly clear in vaccine eligible women ages 2 2 -26 who had the highest levels of accurate knowledge and overall awareness of HPV and the HPV vaccine. For groups that had high levels of knowledge and confidence in the pre-ad discussion, the HPV vaccine ads seemed slightly clarifying. Groups with less knowledge in the pre-ad discussion and those that had a hard time specifying what they knew found the ads \"inter esting\" or \"informative\" at first reaction, but had difficulty articulating what they had learned. In addition, these groups tended to only process the information presented in the ads and in many cases assumed that if facts were omitted or downplayed th ey must not be true or relevant. As one father noted, the ads \"mentioned specifically c ervical cancer and you can sort of then imply from that that the virus must not cause other types of cancers.\" Details from 116 the ads were often mixed up or confused during reca ll\u2014especially the distinction between HPV (a virus) and cervical cancer (a potent ial outcome of the virus) and statistics about cervical cancer diagnosis. For sev eral groups, the more they \"learned\" from the ads, the more questions they had. In other words, the more they thought about the information presented the more confused they be came. Participants in these groups often questioned the origin of HPV and suggested th at HPV could be contracted through a wide variety of pathways including but no t limited to sexual contact. This confusion seemed to stem from the fact that the ads only featured women (reflecting who was able to get the vaccine at the time). For g roups that had lower levels of knowledge and confidence in pre-ad discussions, the vaccine ads introduced more questions they could not answer. 6. Strengths and limitations This study has two major strengths. First, it goes beyond the traditional mixed-methods approach that uses qualitative and qu antitative data in a multiphase study. Instead, this study integrates qualitative a nd quantitative paradigms at many levels of the research process (Tashakkori and Tedd lie, 1998; Creswell, 1995). Second, ads are a huge source of information for vaccine de cision-makers. To date, only one other study has examined what these ads communicate or what vaccine eligibles learn from them. Leader et al. (2011) examined one direct -to-consumer advertisement among female adolescents. The present study examined eigh t ads and included all decision- makers (female and males 15 -26 and parents of youth 11 -17). 117 In addition to its strengths, this study also has s everal limitations. First, this study used a small purposive sample; therefore it is not representative of the entire population of vaccine decision-makers. Participants in this st udy likely had a higher level of knowledge than the general population or some perso nal interest in the topic. Second, some factual information about HPV was necessarily given in the informed consent documents that could have affected pre-knowledge le vels. Finally, although the moderator did not answer questions about HPV or the vaccine during focus groups or interviews, and participants were asked to fill out post-tests immediately after viewing the ads, responses may have been influenced by what other respondents said during pre-ad discussion. 7. Conclusions This study examined how pharmaceutical ads for Gar dasil and Cervarix changed vaccine decision-maker knowledge about HPV and the HPV vaccine. Data suggest that knowledge improved in many areas after watching the direct-to-consumer ads but more importantly they reveal that the messa ges therein served to clarify some and confuse others based on their previous knowledg e and confidence. This confusion could have unanticipated adverse outcomes as some i ndividuals may have a false sense of security and perceive their risk of HPV an d its sequelae to be low or non- existent. Eligible males seemed to be particularly confused by the ads due to their focus on females, which may partially explain the lower r ate of uptake among this population. For the purposes of communicating HPV prevention in the future, public-health 118 professionals need to reframe the vaccine for a lar ger target audience \u2014highlighting the high prevalence of HPV, non-cervical cancer sequela e such as genital warts and head and neck cancer, and who is now eligible for the va ccine. As the vaccine is now approved and recommended for males and females, mes saging needs to make HPV more salient for both groups. 119 C. Manuscript 3: \"As Seen on Television: A Qualitative Examination of Human Papillomavirus Vaccine Ads\" 1. Summary The Human Papillomavirus (HPV) is the most common STI in the United States and can cause genital warts as well a s cervical, anal, and oropharyngeal cancers. Two vaccines are currently a vailable to prevent several strains of HPV. Both vaccines help prevent two stra ins responsible for the majority of HPV-related cancer. One also protects a gainst two other strains that cause almost all genital warts. Research suggests t hat framing the HPV vaccine as cancer prevention may increase vaccine uptake am ong key decision-makers (males and females ages 18 -26 and parents of youth 11 -17) by targeting certain beliefs about getting the vaccine. However, researc h about how the HPV vaccine has actually been framed has not yet been conducted . This study uses a mixed- methods approach, involving discourse analysis and focus groups of vaccine decision-makers, to examine eight direct-to-consume r HPV vaccine ads. This approach allowed me to analyze the same media text from two different perspectives to gain a more comprehensive understan ding of how the ads frame the HPV vaccine, what underlying beliefs they targe t, and how decision-makers react to them. Findings from the discourse analysis were confirmed and elaborated on by the focus groups: the ads frame th e HPV vaccine as cervical cancer prevention and target many underlying belief s such as perceived susceptibility, perceived severity, and perceived n orms. While many of the underlying beliefs targeted by the ads resonated wi th vaccine decision-makers, 120 the overall framing of the vaccine should be change d to include both females and males. 2. Background a. Human papillomavirus Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the most common sex ually transmitted infection (STI) in the United States. O f the estimated 14 million new cases each year, nearly half are among those aged 1 5 -24 years old (Satterwhite et al., 2013). The virus is spread through direct s kin-to-skin contact during vaginal, oral, and anal intercourse. Most HPV infec tions go away on their own within two years. However, in some cases, HPV can d evelop into genital warts or cancer. Cervical cancer is most often associated wi th HPV but the virus can also lead to vaginal, vulvar, anal, penile, and orophary ngeal cancer. In addition, HPV is responsible for all cases of genital warts and n early all incidence of cervical and anal cancer. While there is no cure for HPV, th ere are two vaccines on the market that help prevent the most common strains of the virus. b. The vaccines The FDA approved the first HPV vaccine, Merck's G ardasil, in 2006. This quadrivalent vaccine prevents four st rains of HPV: 6 and 11 (responsible for 90% of genital warts) and 16 and 1 8 (which cause 70% of cervical cancer and nearly half of all vaginal, vul var, and penile cancer). In addition, HPV 16 alone is responsible for more than 85% of anal cancer and more than half of all cancers diagnosed in the orop harynx (NCI, 2010; Chow et 121 al., 2010; Watson et al., 2008). Gardasil is licens ed for use in males and females ages 9 -26. However it is routinely recommended for females and males ages 11 -12 as part of the adolescent immunization regimen, as well as females ages 13 -26 and males ages 13 -21 who have not been immunized previously, or who have not received all three doses of the vaccine se ries. Men ages 22 -26 may receive the vaccine, but it is only recommended for men who have sex with men (MSM) and others at high risk in this age group (CD C, 2011). A second vaccine, GSK's Cervarix, was approved in fall 2009 and prote cts against HPV 16 and 18. This bivalent vaccine is recommended for routine va ccination in girls ages 11 -12 and as a catch-up vaccination for females ages 13 -26 (CDC, 2010). Cervarix is not approved for males. c. Advertising as a main source of information Shortly after FDA approval, both Merck and GSK la unched advertising campaigns to market their vaccines. In the last few years, direct-to- consumer ads have become a major source of informat ion about the HPV vaccine both for youth and parent decision-makers. Cates et al. (2010) investigated how parents learned about the HPV vacc ine, and found that pharmaceutical ads were the most commonly cited inf ormation source (64% of respondents). Similarly, another study by Hughes et al. (2009) found that 83% of parents had heard of the vaccine through drug compa ny ads. Youth and young adults eligible for the vaccine have also reported hearing about it through such ads. Caskey et al. (2009) found that 66% of female respondents age 13 -26 122 reported Gardasil commercials as their primary sour ce of vaccine information. More recently, Katz et al. (2011) reported that 59% of male college students surveyed cited commercials as their primary source of information. As advertising seems to be one of the main sources that decision-m akers use to get information about the HPV vaccine, it is important to explore t he content of the ads, as well as what audiences derive from them. d. Message framing Message frames provide a way for people to under stand complicated issues and can influence a person's vie ws on a particular issue. Framing involves highlighting important details the audience should pay attention to and downplaying other information (\"selection\") and making certain pieces of information noticeable, meaningful, and memorable t o the audience (\"salience\"). By selecting particular information and elevating its salience , framing helps audiences process the information, understand its m eaning, and store it in their memory (Entman, 1993). Media frames often reflect a nd influence public opinion on certain issues (Kahneman and Tversky, 1984). Recent studies have examined the effect of message framing on HPV vaccine acceptability (Liddon et al., 2010; Gerend et al., Friedman and Shepeard, 2007; Gerend and Shepherd, 2007 Sperber e t al., 2007), intention to vaccinate (Lechuga et al., 2011; Bigman et al., 201 0; Leader et al., 2009), and vaccine uptake (Gerend and Sheperd, 2011; Jurskova et al., 2011). These studies suggest that framing the vaccine as prevent ing cervical cancer may 123 influence parental and adolescent beliefs about the HPV vaccine and minimize STI-related stigma. However, some of these studies also indicate that this framing does not resonate with all vaccine decision -makers, especially males. e. Vaccine behavior Most studies examining HPV vaccine behavior have focused on vaccine acceptability, meaning the willingness t o vaccinate oneself or one's child. A review of these studies found a significan t relationship between acceptability and most HBM constructs including per ceived susceptibility, perceived benefits, perceived barriers, and physici an recommendation as a cue to action (Brewer and Fazekas, 2007). A few studies have examined predictors of HPV vaccine uptake and found that subjective nor ms, perceived barriers, perceived susceptibility, and a physician's cue to action are associated with HPV vaccine uptake (Allen et al., 2009; Brewer et al., 2011; Rosenthal et al., 2011; Reiter et al., 2009). Another study by Gerend and S hepherd (2011) found that intention to vaccinate was the strongest predictor of HPV vaccine uptake. It also found that a combination of five constructs, two fr om the TBP and three from HBM were most predictive of vaccination intention: subjective norms, self- efficacy, perceived severity, perceived susceptibil ity and safety concerns. f. Purpose of the study Research conducted before HPV vaccine licensure suggests that framing the HPV vaccine as cancer prevention m ay target certain underlying 124 beliefs about getting the vaccine and increase inte ntion to vaccinate among key vaccine decision-makers (Leader et al., 2009; Sperb er et al., 2008). However, research has yet to examine how the vaccine has act ually been framed. The present study aims to address this gap in the liter ature by examining the following research questions: (1) how do direct-to- consumer ads frame the HPV vaccine? (2) To what extent do the ads target five underlying beliefs about getting the HPV vaccine (perceived susceptibility, perceived barriers, perceived severity, perceived norms, and self-efficacy)? (3) How do these underlying beliefs resonate with vaccine decision-makers? 3. Methods This study uses a mixed-methods approach, which in Creswell's (2003) typology would be characterized as a sequent ial transformative strategy \u2014 a two-phased approach in which different types of d ata are collected and analyzed at different time points, and then integra ted at the interpretation stage. While traditionally used in studies that combine qu alitative and quantitative methods, this approach can also be used for multi-m ethod qualitative research. The present study uses two different qualitative me thods to explore the latent content of eight direct-to-consumer HPV vaccine ads (Table III). First, discourse analysis was used to explore how the HPV vaccine ha s been framed across vaccine ads and how this framing may reflect and at the same time influence vaccine decision-makers' attitudes towards the vacc ine specifically and about sexual health more broadly. Next, the same ads were shown to focus groups of 125 vaccine decision-makers (males and females ages 15 -26 and parents of youth ages 11 -17) to gauge their reactions to the content. The da ta from each were analyzed separately. Later, findings were integrate d by mapping focus-group themes onto the thematic findings of the discourse analysis. The following sections describe each method in detail. a. Discourse analysis Discourse is defined as \"spoken or written language use\" and \"other types of semiotic activity (i.e., activi ty that produces meanings), such as visual images (photography, video, diagrams) and non-verbal communication (e.g., gestures)\" (Fairclough, 2000, 309). It refle cts and reinforces what is happening in society at any given time and is often documented in media texts such as books, television, and movies. We can use d iscourse analysis to examine media texts as cultural artifacts, \"explori ng the tension between two sides of language use, the socially shaped and the socially constitutive\" (Fairclough, 2000, 309). The purpose of discourse analysis is to examine a t ext \"not only as form, meaning and mental process, but as complex structur es and hierarchies of interaction and social practice and their functions in context, society, and culture\" (van Djik, 1997). Using Fairclough's (2000) framewo rk for critical discourse analysis, we can examine a communicative event with in the context of how society uses language, or its \"orders of discourse. \" This approach involves examining the relationship between the three dimens ions of a communicative 126 event: the text (anything that uses language to pro duce meaning), the discursive practices of a community (how the text is produced and used), and the sociocultural context of the event (the immediate s ituational context of the communicative event or its wider context like the e conomic, political, or cultural landscape in which it exists) (Fairclough, 2000). B y examining a communicative event through the lens of its orders of discourse, we can understand its genre: the ways in which it is \"normative, drawing upon fa miliar types and formats . . . and creative, using old resources in new ways\" (Fai rclough, 1995, 56). In this study, discourse analysis was used to exami ne HPV vaccine commercials (the communicative events) analyzing th e actual words used in each advertisement along with the nonverbal cues (t he text), the production elements of the ads and how advertising is consumed in the culture (the discursive practice) and how HPV and the HPV vaccin e is viewed within broader society (the socioculture practice). The communicat ive event was also examined within the context of its orders of discourse: phar maceutical advertising logic. b. Focus groups Lunt and Livingston (1996) suggest that focus gro ups can be used to better understand how audiences make sense of and distill meaning from what they see on television. To that end, this stud y used focus groups to explore audience reaction to eight direct-to-consumer HPV v accine ads. All focus groups were conducted in Chicago, Illinois either at the U IC School of Public Health (n=11) or a community-based organization (n=1). The same moderator and 127 notetaker facilitated all focus groups. Separate di scussion guides were used for the parents and vaccine-eligible groups, but there was a considerable amount of overlap in their content. Focus-group participants were asked to watch eight vaccine ads and discuss their reactions. This study used a purposive sample of vaccine deci sion-makers: males and females ages 15 -26 and parents of males and females ages 11 -17. Focus groups were divided by age of vaccine-eligible (11 -12, 13 -14, 15 -17, 18 -21, 22 - 26), sex of vaccine-eligible (male, female), and de cision-maker role (parent, vaccine eligible). A total of 45 people participate d across 12 focus groups held between October 2012 and December 2012. Of the 12 s essions, six were held for parent groups (n=15) and included 10 mothers (t hree discussing sons, seven discussing daughters) and five fathers (three discu ssing sons, two discussing daughters). The other six sessions consisted of mal es and females between the ages of 15 and 26 or \"vaccine-eligibles\" (n=30). Participants were initially recruited online throu gh virtual message boards and word-of-mouth. Interested participants called o r emailed research personnel and were screened for eligibility as part of the re cruitment process. Those who met the inclusion criteria were enrolled into the a ppropriate focus group (e.g., for their age, sex, decision-maker role). All enrolled participants were sent information sheets either by email or by mail prior to the focus-group meeting. All recruitment materials were approved by the UIC Inst itutional Review Board. Informed consent was obtained from each participant age 18 and over upon arrival for the focus group. Assent was obtained fr om participants ages 15 -17 as 128 was parental permission. All participants were give n a $20 gift card after the 90- minute focus-group session. c. Data analysis To analyze the data in this study, I drew on a co mbination of constructs from HBM, TPB, and IBM that may influenc e HPV vaccine intention or uptake (Figure 3). The constructs examined were: pe rceived susceptibility (the extent to which someone believes they are at risk f or HPV or its sequelae); perceived barriers (potential roadblocks that could prevent someone from getting the HPV vaccine); perceived severity (how serious t he consequences of not getting vaccinated are); perceived norms (beliefs a bout what others think they should do and what others like them are doing); and self-efficacy (the perceived ability to control the behavior and the outcome). T hese constructs guided the discourse analysis and development of the focus-gro up coding guide. i. Discourse analysis This study uses framing theory and a combination of health behavior constructs to analyze the vaccine a ds. First, using framing theory, it is important to recognize who produced t he text in order to better understand why certain dimensions of the issue are highlighted and others are not. Therefore, when examining the framing of the a ds, I used advertising logic to guide the analysis: these ads are framed to increas e profit margins and sell not only a product, but the idea of prevention as a sou nd investment in the future. 129 Second, ads were examined for inclusion of the five belief constructs noted above. These five constructs were operational ized along four dimensions and each ad was viewed for: (1) tone , in terms of language, overall orientation as well as audio/visual cues; (2) audience , defined as who the ad is speaking to and who is being portrayed in it; (3) agency , or who the ad suggests has the power to prevent the infection; (4) frame , or what information was highlighted about HPV and HPV-related diseases and what was downplayed. I n addition, I observed the genre of each ad to examine the orders of discourse and see if they were normative (like typical drug ads) or creative (unli ke traditional direct-to-consumer advertising approaches). Ads were viewed repeatedly until no new observation s were noted and data reached saturation. All vaccine ads were viewe d multiple times to better understand how they reflected these dimensions. Aft er analyzing each ad individually, all ads for the same product were com pared. Themes found in Merck ads were compared to themes found in GSK ads (Ayres et al., 2003). ii. Focus groups Data analysis began immediately after each focus - group session with a meeting between the moderator and notetaker to debrief about the discussion. Additionally, the moderator a nd notetaker independently wrote up their notes and observations after each se ssion (C\u00f4t\u00e9-Arsenault and Morrison-Beedy, 2005). Audio recordings of the focu s groups were transcribed verbatim by a professional transcription service. T he moderator reviewed all 130 transcripts and assigned aliases before uploading t hem to Atlas/TI, a software program for managing and analyzing qualitative data (Muhr, 2012). All transcripts were coded in Atlas/ TI by a resear ch assistant (\"coder\") in accordance with a pre-established coding guide. The initial coding guide was developed around the conceptual model hypothesizing the relationship between message framing and five underlying beliefs illustr ated in Figure 3. After coding one transcript, the coder met with the PI to discus s any issues encountered and suggest changes to the coding guide. The coding gui de went through four versions and was amended after several rounds of co ding. The text in each transcript was segmented into discrete passages, wi th each segment capturing one complete \"idea\" \u2014i.e., a cohesive narrative from one person or an ex change on a given topic among two or more focus-group part icipants. (In Atlas/TI these segments are called \"Quotations.\") The Memo functio n in Atlas/TI was used to explain why certain codes were used or to provide c ontext to the quote that was not captured within the highlighted text \u2014for example, which clip the respondent was referring to if they did not state it. After al l transcripts were coded by the primary coder, the moderator coded a 10% subsample of the transcripts as an inter-rater reliability check yielding 80% agreemen t. The moderator resolved all discrepancies and decided which code was accurately applied. Theme generation began during the post-session debr iefs and continued through the coding process. Atlas/TI's Query Tool ( a search tool in which Boolean connectors can be used to construct complex search strings involving 131 multiple codes) was used to extract and analyze gro ups of passages on similar topics. 4. Results The discourse analysis revealed that all eight of the direct-to- consumer ads framed the HPV vaccine as a method of cervical cancer prevention. By framing the vaccine as preventing ce rvical cancer, these ads attempt to downplay the sexual transmission of HPV and highlight the extreme and potentially devastating long-term consequences of the virus. Because cancer is universally feared, this framing helps the vacci ne become more salient and appeal to a larger swath of the target audience, in cluding parents who do not want to think about their daughters becoming sexual ly active. By avoiding discussion of sex and primarily featuring women in these ads, the framing also reflects social norms about sexual health: women mu st shoulder the burden of protection and endure the long-term consequences si lently and alone. Overall, focus-group discussions reflected many of the thematic findings of the discourse analysis and offered additional insig hts into the latent content. Participants noted that the ads blurred the relatio nship between HPV and cervical cancer in a concerted effort to focus on the seriou sness of the latter as communicated through stark statistics, severe image ry, and emotionally charged fear appeals. Because most participants knew that H PV was an STI prior to watching the ads, the downplaying of sexual transmi ssion was noticeable and largely distracting for participants. Participants viewed ads through their own 132 experience and identity and responded to ads from a relatively personal perspective. Females tried to see themselves in the ads and with a few exceptions reported that they felt represented in t he ads on the basis of sex, age, and race. Males felt either excluded from or blamed for female misery by the ads. The considerable lack of males in these ads suggest ed to most participants that this was a female issue only and while males could give their female partners cervical cancer, women alone were responsible for p rotecting themselves and dealing with the consequences. Using the discourse analysis themes as a framework , the following sections integrate findings from both methods to an swer my research questions: how the eight direct-to-consumer ads have framed th e HPV vaccine, to what extent the ads targeted five underlying beliefs, an d which beliefs resonated with the vaccine decision-makers. The full discourse ana lysis can be found elsewhere. Table VIII maps the five underlying beli ef constructs, discourse analysis themes, and focus-group reactions. The fol lowing are four overarching themes that emerged from this analysis \u2014themes that integrate findings from the two phases of the study. 133 TABLE VIII MAPPING OF UNDERLYING BELIEFS, DISCOURSE ANALYSIS T HEMES AND FOCUS-GROUP REACTIONS Underlying Beliefs Discourse Analysis Themes Focus-group Reactions Prevention and Disruption Fueling Fear The Face of the HPV Vaccine Where the Boys Are Perceived Susceptibility X X X X All women are at equal risk for cervical cancer Males can't get HPV/sequelae Cancer comes out of nowhere Perceived Severity X X Cancer is scary HPV can cause infertility HPV can make women really sick Women deal with cancer alone Perceived Barriers No mention of cost or access Side effects seemed typical Perceptions of vaccine safety were influenced by personal experience rather than ads Perceived Norms X X Boys are to blame Token diversity Self-identify in various ways Self-Efficacy X X Women and parents have the power of prevention Getting the vaccine seems easy 134 a. Prevention and disruption Discourse analysis revealed that ads were evenly divided between those that were optimistic and light, much like a typical or normative pharmaceutical ad, and those that were pessimistic and dark, a decidedly more creative direct-to-consumer approach. Regardless of the tone and genre, the common subtext informs the audience that a cervical cancer diagnosis comes out of nowhere (perceived susceptibility), shatters dreams and disrupts the lives of young women (perceived severity). Luckily this d isruption can be prevented by getting the HPV vaccine and girls and women \"have t he power to choose\" (self- efficacy). Pharmaceutical ads typically follow a fa miliar template: show the problem and suggest how a certain drug can fix it. Each genre uses a prevention template to advertise the HPV vaccine, but the orie ntation is different. Optimistic commercials talk about how the vaccine could preven t cervical cancer (a future disruption). The pessimistic ads graphically illust rate this future disruption and then recommend the vaccine as a \"cure\" for it. Thes e ads also perpetuate the confusion in the public discourse between treatment and prevention by turning a prevention message (the vaccine protects against HP V and by extension cervical cancer) into a treatment message (the vaccine is th e prescription for cervical cancer). This works for the drug companies because they know how to sell treatment, as well as consumers who exist within th e US healthcare system that historically rewards treatment over prevention. Focus groups immediately noticed that certain ads were \"dark and sad\" or \"negative\" while others were \"positive\" and \"lighth earted.\" Moreover, focus-group 135 participants understood the subtext of the ads: cer vical cancer is disruptive. As Evan, a 21-year-old male noted: \"well, I guess that 's how [cervical cancer] attacks people. It comes out of nowhere. So you're just living your life and then you're diagnosed with cervical cancer. They use it in a way to get women's attention . . .[but] that's also how it happens in life.\" Taking this idea one step further, others discussed the notion that it made t hem \"think about the consequence\" of what happens if you don't \"get your self immunized\" particularly in the darker, more creative ads. As Puja, mother o f an adolescent daughter put it, \"basically I thought the ad was trying to give you the message that your life can be completely changed if HPV happens or cervical ca ncer happens, so think about the vaccination, which can prevent . . . thi s pause and you can continue your life.\" This theme was also observed in the mor e positive ads as well. Lisa, mother of an adolescent son reported \"the message I got was showing the . . . you know, parents and daughters enjoying life. To m e, indirectly it said, you know, enjoy life. You take the vaccine, it will kee p going this way.\" While participants understood the ads focused on p revention and disruption, this did not preclude them from being c onfused about the distinction between prevention and treatment. Many comments mad e throughout the focus groups suggested there was confusion about this. As one mother of a teenage daughter noted, in one of the ads \"everything was k ind of poppy and sensational and then the picture just kind of went to blah . . . it just went downhill and then it came back up . . . their life went back to being ok ay after they got the vaccine.\" 136 This comment suggests that the vaccine can treat th e disruption of cervical cancer, as the advertisers intended. b. Fueling fear Because of the cancer prevention frame, these ad s intentionally downplay some pertinent information a bout HPV, including transmission, risk factors, non-cervical cancer seq uelae, and primary prevention recommendations. Details about an STI often spark f eelings of disgust (Smith, 2007), an emotion that is hard to sell. Highlightin g and decontextualizing cervical cancer incidence and prevalence (perceived suscepti bility) and inaccurately suggesting that HPV and cervical cancer can directl y lead to infertility (perceived severity), however, ignites fear that can be turned into profit. Fueled by seemingly bleak statistics, serious music, and seve re images, the cancer frame paints a frightening picture of what could happen ( perceived severity) to women who don't get the HPV vaccine, making uptake more s alient. Focus-group participants were keenly aware that th e ads talked about cervical cancer and not HPV and many noted that the ads \"made it seem like it was all the same thing.\" As Julia, a 19-year-old fe male, noted: \"in the middle [of the \"What If\" ad], I guess that's when she got HPV and then she got cervical cancer afterwards. I feel like it was kind of blurr ed so that it makes it seem like HPV does that to you. Like it does, but it's just t hey're two different things that weren't distinguished the way I would have liked th em to be.\" While most groups questioned why HPV's sexual transmission was largel y omitted, they did not fully 137 appreciate that other details like risk factors, ge nital warts, and primary cancer prevention was also downplayed; nor did they unders tand that the vaccine framing necessitated the highlighting of cervical c ancer at the expense of other information. The message framing in the ads not only highlighte d cervical cancer, it both targeted the audience's perceived severity and instilled a perception of severity through the dark tone of the ads making th e issue more salient. This fear framing was very compelling to them and often left them feeling both emotionally moved and \"kind of manipulated.\" For some, hearing the word cancer was enough to inspire fear and \"make the alarm start ri nging.\" Parents reacted especially strongly to the notion of cancer in the ads suggesting that \"when you hear the word 'cancer' it's shocking,\" \"no matter w hat kind of cancer, it is serious. Anything that says cancer is just, it's a red flag, \" and \"the minute you say cancer, it's like we know how bad cancer is.\" Many vaccine- eligibles, however, noted cancer was abstract to them and felt \"far away\" or \"futuristic.\" For some people, it was the images of cancer that struck them the hardest. This seemed especially true of male vaccin e-eligibles and parents of sons. As Peter, the father of a teenage son suggest ed: [The ad where] the woman was in the hospital and sh e had a shaved head . . . you know, I think that's an image that people can relate to. Most people have known at least one person \u2014a friend or a relative \u2014who's had some sort of cancer, so . . . so it was just up the re a few seconds, but that's all I think they needed to do. It stuck with me. 138 This image also resonated with Lisa, the mother of an adolescent son: Yeah, when they showed her up in the stirrups, you know. When they went to the extreme of [showing] a healthy young la dy at the beginning and then she was all sick. You know . . . in the ch air with that IV connected to her. And I'm sure everyone who has [ca ncer] doesn't go through the extreme but they're just showing how ba d it can get. Evan, 21, remembered the same image: \"one of the gi rls . . . she was bald and sickly. She was plugged up to IVs. Like that imager y was pretty . . . serious.\" Beyond the language and images, the ads used stati stics to communicate the severity and ubiquity of cervical cancer. These statistics \"seemed like a lot\" for some but after contextualizing the numbers, the y lost their impact for most groups, including 15 -17 year old males: Charlie: I mean, that's a lot but it's not a ton. Roberto: When you first hear it, it sounds like a l ot. But then when you think about it, it's not that much. Jack: I mean, it's still a lot of people, but that is out of 300 million or so Americans. So it's a lot, but it's not like every s ingle person you see walking down the street or anything. Still others remained unimpressed given the broade r context of cancer. As Kelly, a woman in her early 20s noted, \"there's oth er cancers that have higher prevalence rates . . . I'm pretty sure only . . . I mean, 11,000 is a lot a year, but [not] like compared to, you know, breast cancer.\" c. The face of the vaccine While these ads intentionally show a diverse gro up of women (simultaneously targeting perceived norms and perceived susceptibility), 139 proportionally, they do not reflect the groups most affected by cervical cancer (both in terms of diagnoses and mortality). While A frican American and Hispanic women have the highest mortality and incidence rate s respectively (NCI, 2012), most of the women and girls seen in the ads are Whi te, which may be indicative of the market segment they are meant to target. One likely explanation for this is that White women and girls are actually the target audience for these commercials because this group is more likely to ha ve a regular source of healthcare and health insurance, get cancer screeni ngs, and receive childhood or routine vaccinations (Agency for Healthcare Rese arch and Quality, 2013; Kaiser Family Foundation, 2012). Because of this, W hite women are more likely than other groups to actually talk to their healthc are provider about the vaccine as well as receive it (CDC, 2012). Therefore, these ads are targeted at those who are most likely to get the vaccine, and not necessa rily a diagnosis of cervical cancer. Focus-group discussion about who was portrayed in the ads and the extent to which participants identified with them v aried significantly. As Karen, a college student noted, \"by putting in different rac es in the commercial, it means this is all women . . . it's how you know you're in cluded in this demographic.\" With the exception of sex, there was little discussion a bout what the inclusion or exclusion of certain groups of people meant. Only t wo mothers made observations along these lines. Most astutely, one mother wondered: \"the one where they women . . . I n oticed there are about six women. There are two African Americans. So I wonder ed if when it comes to 140 people who have it, if that's the scale of, you kno w, how many African Americans out of the group have it? That's what I wondered ab out, if they are showing an accurate representation of people who actually have HPV.\" In general, respondents tried to see themselves in these ads and identify with at least one of the faces shown. Since the ads showed purposefully diverse females, most of the vaccine-eligible women and sev eral of the mothers with daughters in the focus groups were able to identify themselves or their daughters based on age, race, or situation. As Olivia, a fema le college student noted: There are things [the ads portrayed] like, yeah, I want to go to college. I want to travel. I was getting into it. I was like t hinking in the back of my head, oh, I have to fill out my passport and all th is stuff. And then all of the sudden it's just like \"cancer\" . . . and she was yo ung, too. Like she was our age, which was . . . just like unsettling. She was just like our age. She had a boyfriend that's our age. And like I don't know. It was unsettling. Not all women identified with what they saw, howev er. Hispanic women in particular reported having a difficult tim e identifying with the ads. As Isabella, a parent, nervously told the group, \"I do n't see myself there. There were no Hispanic people [in the ads]. I see that th ey focus on some groups, like [Lisa] said, like African Americans. But I don 't see Hispanics there. So . . . I don't see myself in there.\" Julia, 19, echoed thi s sentiment, \"besides the fact that they were like young females with their moms, I didn't feel like I saw myself in them. Cause they represented African Amer icans, Whites, and Asians. But I didn't see any Hispanics. So I was ju st kind of like, oh, that's not me.\" Other people felt excluded from the ads based on their sexual orientation, with one woman in her twenties noting \"the biggest thing that 141 bugged me about [the ads] is just like obviously th e commercials are really geared towards, like, straight people.\" Finally, at least one person suggested that the ads didn't speak to her because everyone i n them \"seemed pretty upper middle class.\" d. Where the boys are: the feminine frame The female narrative is so dominant in these ads that men are almost entirely excluded from the ads. In most of the ads, women are empowered to \"choose to be one less\" (self-efficacy ) but they are simultaneously disempowered as they alone carry the burden of prot ection. When men are included in the ads they give the women HPV, which quickly turns into cervical cancer, and the men slowly disappear as the prognos is gets worse. Because the ads have framed the vaccine as preventing cervical cancer and not HPV, the female narrative is logical but inaccurate. Excludi ng men from the ads speaks directly to perceived susceptibility. This is probl ematic because men can get HPV (which can lead to anal, penile, and head and neck cancer, as well as genital warts) and pass it to their partners. In addition, men and boys can now get the Gardasil vaccine, which means they should be includ ed in the narrative to increase perceived norms around protecting themselv es and their partners against HPV and, by extension, cancer and genital w arts. To be fair, these ads were created before males were able to get the HPV vaccine; however, the lengths to which these ads go to exclude men is sig nificant regardless of whether males can get the vaccine or not. 142 Focus-group participants were very quick to notice the lack of males in the HPV vaccine ads. Isabella, a mother of an adolescen t son noted \"I think they have to focus on boys. I have boys, so I'm worried that, you know, that they can get some diseases, too. . . . That piece is missing .\" Participants noted that the ads portrayed HPV as a \"female virus\" or \"female pr oblem,\" making the \"HPV vaccine seem irrelevant or unnecessary\" for guys. A lmost all male participants and parents of males noted that they would \"tune ou t\" these ads if they were on. As Roberto, a 15-year-old male noted, 'I don't thin k from the commercials that I would consider getting the vaccine. Just because it wasn't even geared towards men at all. It was all women.\" The most interesting finding from the focus groups , however, was the idea that ads actually blame men for giving their female partners cervical cancer. Participants used words like \"culprit,\" \"transmitte r,\" \"bad guy,\" and \"villain\" to describe the men shown in the one ad featuring them . Males around the same age as the guys in the \"What If\" ad seemed to take this portrayal personally. As Evan, 21, reflected: [The ad] started off on like a happy note and then out of nowhere it was like this guy's photo and then it was like 'what if you get HPV?' So like it kind of just made guys seem like villains or someth ing. So it kind of made me think, like, okay, you don't want to hurt your p artner, so . . . I mean, even though he did it unintentionally. But if someo ne gives their partner HPV, pretty much you could destroy them from having children. So I don't know . . . when that happened, it made me think, li ke, man, I should get [the vaccine] to protect her . . . cause everything 's all happy and then it's like what if he gives you HPV? Like that could be me, I don't want to be the villain that like hurts . . . cause just in gen eral no one wants to do that, but you could be put in that position. 143 Males were also quick to notice that the men portr ayed in the \"What If\" ad fade away as the woman grows sicker. Echoing the di scourse analysis, Chad, 26, noticed: So when they were falling in love in the hammock, i t's all great. But then when she's like in the chemo chair, the guy was now here to be seen. Which to me is like, okay, if you don't get the vac cine, you might get HPV. And then you will no longer be desirable. And you w ill no longer . . . there's no men in your life. Which honestly is a very subtl e thing that I noticed, but I thought that was just kind of weird. They're in l ove and now she's alone and bald and in a chemo chair. She looks miserable, you know? So . . . They could have shown him like holding her hand. Yo u know, like being there when he's old and gray. He's still with her. But like, no. You're all by yourself and no one loves you. Peter, a father of a teenage son, remembers the ad the same way: In the one ad . . . she meets the Prince Charming, the dark-haired guy, they go off together . . . [then] he gives her the virus. Okay. But the message of that commercial was, well, she should get the vaccine. Okay. Why not have a double message there? 'You've gotta to get the [vaccine], too, so you don't get . . . give her the cancer.' I mean, that's not at all present in this. I mean, he gives her the virus and then he disappears. Then it shoots to her in the hospital. And that's i t . . . maybe he's at the bedside there, but in terms of the impression . . . he's not there. Then she gets sick and, yeah, he's gone. Peter recognizes that the ads put the burden of pro tection on women and suggests a viable way to add males to the narrative . Following on from this suggestion, David, 26, noted that the ads would hav e been more effective if they were more like \"the herpes commercials [where] ther e's always a partnership. There's always a couple. We're fighting together. I think those are a little bit more effective than the Gardasil and all of them that ma ke it look like it's just about girls . . . and that guys are the villains.\" 144 Finally, confirming findings from the discourse an alysis, the lack of males in the ads made several participants reflect that w omen are ultimately responsible for protecting their own sexual health. Commenting on the \"What If\" ad that hints at HPV's sexual transmission, Rachel, the mother of a teenage daughter noted, \"I think that I do like the idea of it being . . . coming to the forefront that men are the carriers. And it kind of gets you . . . it helps, I think, as a woman to make you more responsible for your body. \" But Dahlia, a woman in her mid-20s, had a very different reaction to this implication: \"it's so annoying it's my responsibility. Dang it.\" 5. Discussion Based on the conceptual model in Figure 3 this stu dy addressed three interrelated research questions. First, it id entified how direct-to-consumer ads frame the HPV vaccine. Discourse analysis and f ocus groups revealed that the HPV vaccine was framed as cervical cancer preve ntion. This framing necessarily highlights the severity of the disease relying on generalized fear associated with cancer to make the issue more salie nt among audiences. Highlighting cervical cancer also allowed the ads t o focus on the female narrative of health in an effort to both empower women and mo thers to get the vaccine and feature a diverse range of faces in the ads to sugg est that all women and girls are at risk. The cancer prevention angle also avoid s the implication that parents must consider their child's future sexual health, s omething parents of young adolescents may prefer. But framing is more than ju st what is selected and made 145 salient, it is also about what is downplayed. Throu gh cancer framing, the ads downplay many pertinent facts about HPV (transmissi on, risk factors, transience, other sequelae) leaving more room in the ads to fue l audience fear about the perceived severity of cancer as well as their own p erceived susceptibility. The downplaying of transmission, in particular, allowed advertisers to focus solely on the female narrative and all but exclude men and bo ys from seven of the eight ads. The lack of men was among the strongest themes in both the discourse analysis and the focus groups. In addition, this study examined the extent to whic h the message framing in the ads targets five underlying beliefs and how these constructs resonate with vaccine decision-makers (Table VIII). Of these beli efs, perceived susceptibility is the most pervasive across the discourse analysis th emes as well as the most resonant among vaccine decision-makers. The ads not only suggest that cervical cancer comes out of nowhere but they tell the audie nce that it's \"closer than you know.\" Since the ads almost exclusively feature wom en and mothers with daughters, not surprisingly, perceived susceptibili ty seemed to be split by sex in focus groups. Women and parents with daughters felt more at risk for cervical cancer. Their perceived susceptibility for HPV was not fully discussed as ads prompted participants to think mostly about cervica l cancer. Because males are virtually absent from the ads, males and parents wi th sons were confused about whether HPV affected them and didn't find the cervi cal cancer prevention message in the ads relevant to them. 146 When ads targeted perceived norms, it was almost al ways in conjunction with perceived susceptibility: showing diverse, hea lthy women engaging in a variety of activities. The images make the audience understand that any woman can get cervical cancer, including them. Interestin gly, women tried to identify with something or someone in the ads. People self-identi fied in various ways. They felt included or excluded for different reasons. Ma les had a difficult time identifying with the ads and almost unanimously fel t blamed by them. While perceived severity is only found in half of the the mes, it is present in all of the ads. The main message is clear, if you don't get th e vaccine you will get cancer and end up alone. The severity of cancer was convey ed through images (a woman who has lost her hair receiving chemotherapy) , statistics (\"every 47 minutes another woman is diagnosed\"), storyline (\"s he doesn't think she will be able to have kids\"), and tone (dark music, drab col ors, sad expressions). Perceived severity of cancer, not necessarily HPV, was felt very strongly by focus-group participants. Infertility as well as th e portrayal of a young woman getting sick very much resonated across all groups. Emotional responses to these ads based on perceived severity of cancer wer e almost always through the lens of the participant's personal experience. Not surprisingly, many of the ads targeted self-eff icacy and downplayed perceived barriers. Half of the ads directly told t he audience that they \"had the power to choose\" suggesting that women and mothers could control both the behavior and the outcome. Other ads cued the viewer to \"talk to your doctor\" making vaccine decision-makers understand that ther e was something relatively 147 easy they could do to prevent cancer. All focus gro ups recognized that the ads made it seem like getting the HPV vaccine was an ea sy thing to do. However, they also recognized that the ads did not mention c ost, access, or safety of the vaccine, confirming the discourse analysis finding that ads downplay perceived barriers. 6. Strength and limitations This study has two major strengths. First, it uses a mixed-methods approach that is well suited to the research questi ons being explored. By using two different qualitative methods, discourse analys is and then focus groups, to examine the same text (HPV vaccine ads), this study offers a more complete analysis of the latent content of the ads than usin g a single method. Second, ads are a huge source of information for both parents a nd those eligible to get the vaccine, but relatively few published studies have systematically examined their overt and latent content or how they influence cons umers' attitudes and behaviors around HPV vaccines. While Malkowski (201 3), explored the narrative discourse of a different Gardasil campaign (a pamph let-based communication called \"My Voice\"), to my knowledge there have not been any studies examining the content of these particular ads. Additionally, only one other study (Leader et. al., 2011) has examined reactions to an HPV vaccine ad. In that study, female adolescents were asked to provide feedback on one d irect-to-consumer ad (\"One Less\"). The present study goes beyond Leader et al. (2011) by examining eight 148 different ads and including all possible decision-m akers (female and males 15 -26 and parents of youth 11 -17) in the focus groups. This study should be viewed in light of its limitat ions. First, as is typical of qualitative studies, this investigation used a smal l purposive sample; therefore feedback on the ads is not representative of the en tire population of vaccine decision-makers. Second, although the moderator was careful to remain neutral and not lead the discussion, participants knew that the purpose of the focus group was to give feedback on the ads. Therefore, t hey may have given greater thought to the content of the ads than they would h ave in a non-research setting. 7. Conclusions Both the discourse analysis and focus groups sugges ted that HPV is a female virus and that women are ultimately res ponsible for protecting their own sexual health and dealing with the burden of th e consequences, often alone. Despite the nearly unanimous reaction that the ads were framed to highlight HPV vaccine as only relevant for women, many men and pa rents of boys suggested that males could very naturally be inserted into th e ads to make the narrative more inclusive, something that should be considered in future HPV vaccine ads. This reaction supports the findings of a recent stu dy that suggested parents of pre-teenage sons wanted to see racially diverse ima ges of sons and parents in motivational vaccine ads (Cates et al., 2012). Whil e these suggestions may expand the target audience for the ads and increase resonance among all vaccine decision-makers, ads would also need to com municate potential 149 outcomes of HPV that affect males (e.g., head and n eck, anal, and penile cancer, as well as genital warts) as other research has sho wn that males and parents of sons are not motivated to get the HPV vaccine in or der to protect female partners alone (Liddon et al., 2010). In addition, these seq uelae need to be highlighted so that the narrative includes the MSM population, a g roup at high risk for HPV who received an extended recommendation for getting the vaccine by ACIP. Analysis revealed that these ads highlighted cancer and downplayed HPV and its sexual transmission in an attempt to circum vent the stigma attached to STIs. This may have made logical sense when marketi ng the vaccine at a time where knowledge about HPV was relatively low. Howev er, almost all focus-group participants in this study knew that HPV was sexual ly transmitted prior to watching the ads. Therefore, not mentioning HPV's s exual transmission in the ads was not only confusing but distracting for focu s-group participants: by intentionally downplaying how HPV is spread, vaccin e ads may have increased the taboo around its sexual transmission and, by ex tension, perpetuated stigma. Future advertising should also address HPV's sexual transmission and highlight its prevalence helping to normalize the virus and p ossibly alleviate some of the surrounding stigma (Waller et al., 2007). 150 V. CONCLUSION The HPV vaccines are an important public health too l. Both vaccines help to prevent strains of the most common STI in the Unite d States and the cause of many different types of anogenital cancers, as well as h ead and neck cancers. One of the vaccines, Gardasil, also protects against the two s trains that cause 90% of genital warts. Preventing HPV means reducing the disease bu rden of this STI as well as its potential sequelae. Unfortunately, HPV vaccination rates in the United States are considerably lower than that of other vaccines as w ell as the Healthy People 2020 goals (series completion for 80.0% of females aged 13 -15). Data from NIS show that 53% of females ages 13-17 had received one or more doses, and 35% of females in the same age group had received three or more doses in 2011. While recommendations suggest that 11 -12 years of age is the ideal time for administratio n, NIS data also show a statistically significant increase in vaccine uptak e with every year from age 13 -17. This trend suggests that, despite the recommended age of vaccination, parents may be getting their daughters vaccinated according to the ir own timeline, likely corresponding with when they expect their daughters to become sex ually active. Rates of vaccination dip after the age of 18, with 43% of females 19 -21 years of age and 21.5% of females 22 -26 years of age receiving one or more doses of the HPV vaccine in 2011 (CDC, 2013). Male vaccine rates are expected to be lower than fe male rates given the length of time the vaccine has been licensed for this popu lation and when it received routine recommendation status, and they are. Only 8% of mal es ages 13-17 received one or 151 more doses, and only 1% of males in the same age-ra nge group received three or more doses of the HPV vaccine (CDC, 2012). Males 19 -26 also had low rates of uptake in 2011: only 2.8% of males 19 -21 and 1.7% of males 22 -26 had received one or more doses of the HPV vaccine (CDC, 2013). These rates s uggest that we have a way to go to reach herd immunity levels (80% -85% of the recommended population). According to a recent review of the literature by E tter et al. (2012), many factors likely contribute to these low rates, including lac k of healthcare provider recommendation, beliefs about not being at risk, in stitutional barriers (Liddon et al., 2012), negative attitudes about the vaccine, and la ck of information (Guerry et al., 2011). Addressing these factors will undoubtedly re quire a multi-pronged approach including but not limited to several of those shown in Figure 2: policy level recommendations, healthcare providers, and media. Although the first two of these influences are beyo nd the scope of this research, they need to be expanded upon here. Policy recommen dations to improve uptake are already in place: ACIP routinely recommends the HPV vaccine for both females and males ages 11 -26 and 11 -21 (and MSM 22 -26), respectively, which should trickle down to other policy-level recommendations and infl uence beliefs about the vaccine. However, it is also important to point out that sta te-level policies, primarily those at the school-level should be considered for improved upta ke. Several studies have shown that school-based promotion initiatives can achieve higher rates of vaccination (Gold et al., 2011; Skinner and Robbins, 2010). School manda tes have also been shown to increase vaccination rates of other vaccines and co uld have the same effect on HPV vaccine rates (Dempsey and Schaffer, 2010). In addi tion, these types of policy 152 recommendations could influence underlying beliefs about the vaccine by sending a strong message to parents and adolescents about the importance of this vaccine and their risk of infection. Presumably, these types of policies would also have an effect on vaccine decision-maker information and reduce insti tutional barriers. Healthcare-provider recommendation has been shown t o be one of the most influential factors in vaccine uptake (Gerend et al ., 2009; Reiter et al., 2009). However, while receiving this information from their healthc are providers may be preferable, most adolescents and parents appear to hear about the va ccine from the media first (Rand et al., 2011; Caskey et al., 2009). Further, a content analysis of patient-provider discussions revealed that, on average, patients and parents do not ask questions or indicate their level of knowledge about this vaccin e (Goff et al., 2011). Taken together, this may mean that healthcare providers have to go out of their way to clarify information their patients have previously heard or reframe the vaccine for them in order to highlight its importance and the patient's risk factors. Healthcare providers need to talk to patients and parents about HPV and the vacc ine, stressing who is at risk for HPV, who can get the vaccine, and how vaccination w ell before sexual debut is best. Reactions to how the vaccine has been framed in the media may have important implications for ways to increase vaccine uptake, e specially as they relate to reasons for non-vaccination such as lack of information about t he vaccine and beliefs about not being at risk. The present study found that eight d irect-to-consumer TV ads have framed the HPV vaccine as cervical cancer preventio n, reflecting and perpetuating social norms about sexual health: females must prot ect themselves against disease \u2014 and sometimes their partners \u2014or suffer the consequences alone. This framing 153 contributed to short-term knowledge change and impr essions about HPV, cervical cancer, and the vaccine. According to focus-group p articipants, the ads suggested that all women are at risk for cervical cancer, tapping into their perceived susceptibility and targeting a universal fear of cancer. This framing resonated with parents of daughters and some females ages 15 -26. However, adolescents and young adults also note d that cancer felt \"futuristic\" and that the threat of mor e immediate outcomes (like genital warts) may be more salient among their age group. V accine decision-makers were keenly aware that the ads downplayed HPV transmissi on and, by extension, excluded men and often found this omission distracting and c onfusing. These findings suggest that undoing the previous cervical cancer preventio n framing may help improve the salience of this vaccine and encourage broader upta ke, especially among males. Clear, consistent communication about the HPV vacci ne is key and will require work on all three of these levels. Going forward, w e need to make the vaccine salient to a wider target audience, thus reflecting the most r ecent recommendations. One approach may be to highlight three aspects currentl y downplayed in the vaccine framing: HPV transmission, prevalence, and all pote ntial outcomes. Parents may be reluctant to think about their children becoming se xually active. Therefore, more clearly articulating how HPV is transmitted will allow for a more open discussion of the best time to vaccinate and why the recommendation is set in adolescence. Vaccine trends already suggest that parents are factoring sexual d ebut into their decision-making so there seems little reason not to open the lines of communication around this point. Focus-group parents in the current research also re flected on trying to figure out the \"right time\" to vaccinate based on their suspicions of their child's sexual activity. 154 Discussing transmission also provides clarity about who is at risk for HPV and highlights that although it has been framed as a fe male-only concern, males can get HPV, pass it on to their partners, and develop a ra nge of HPV-related diseases. This approach is undoubtedly controversial but allows fo r the opportunity to normalize HPV, make its prevalence known, and illustrate that almo st everyone is or will be at risk of contracting it. Finally, vaccine decision-makers need to understand that persistent HPV is linked to many outcomes, including anal and orophar yngeal cancers and genital warts, not just cervical cancer. Focusing attention on oro pharyngeal cancer is important for two reasons. First, it reemphasizes that both males and females are at risk. Second, it reflects current and future trends in HPV-related c ancers. Research by Chaturvedi et al. (2011) suggests that if current incidence trends of HPV-related oropharyngeal cancers continue, they will surpass annual cervical cancer rates by 2020. Additionally, as the present research suggests, bringing more attention to genital warts as an outcome of this extremely common STI may resonate more strongl y with older adolescents who have not been vaccinated yet, and who currently sho w lower rates of uptake. Returning to where this study began, framing is an important part of how we communicate, both on an interpersonal level as in p atient-provider discussions and a broader media communication level. Frames help indi viduals and larger audiences understand complex topics, like HPV, by highlightin g what is important and what is salient. If done well, message framing can influenc e underlying beliefs and lead to certain behaviors. The purpose of this research was to better understand the current framing and examine the extent to which it resonate d with vaccine decision-makers. 155 Future studies should explore and test alternative messages and framing that include some of the recommendations above and appeal to dif ferent segments of the target audience. 156 CITED LITERATURE Allen, J.
