N1 - Publisher Copyright: \u00a9 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature. PY - 2023 Y1 - 2023 N2 - Purpose of Review: This study aims to review how complementary and integrative medicine (CIM), defined as therapies utilizing nutrition, physical activity, herbs, supplements, mind-body therapies, homeopathy, and other non-traditional therapies, can address the prevention, treatment, side effects, and recurrence of kidney cancer. This review discusses advances and discoveries in research, gaps in research, current debates on the subject, and directions for future research. We queried Ovid MEDLINE and PubMed databases using the search terms kidney cancer, integrative medicine, integrative oncology, nutrition, supplements, treatment, prevention, and therapy. Searches were limited to integrative medicine and integrative oncology. We reviewed CIM therapies related to prevention, treatment, side effect mitigation, and recurrence of kidney cancers. Recent Findings: Search results yielded 211 studies, of which 87 were relevant to this review. Studies related to CIM and kidney cancer were clustered into themes, including nutrition, physical activity, supplements, mind-body therapies, and alternative therapies. Summary: This review provides a foundation for utilizing the principles of integrative medicine in the prevention of and care for patients with kidney cancer and the need for further focused research on the effectiveness of CIM in kidney cancers.
