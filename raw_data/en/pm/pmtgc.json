There are a few things you can do to keep your pet away from your plants. - The most obvious one is putting the plants out of reach. A high [plant shelf](https://www.modandmint.com/how-to-decorate-plant-shelf/)or plant stand. Another great option is to hang the plant high enough so your cat can't get to it. - Grow some cat grass indoors for your cat. It is safe, but be aware that it can also cause your cat to vomit. This helps to get hairballs out. Exactly the purpose of eating plants in the first place.

If the worst-case scenario happens and your pet has eaten a lot from a toxic plant, contact your veterinarian or local [Animal Poison Control Center](https://www.aspca.org/pet-care/animal-poison-control) asap.
