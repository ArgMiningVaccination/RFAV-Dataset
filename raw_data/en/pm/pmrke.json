These proceedings are based on the discussion and interactive question and answer session conducted by a mult idisciplinary panel of researc hers, clinicians, and advocates and an invited audience of journalis ts, blood cancer patients and fam ily members, research donors and other members of The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society community. Executive Summary This is an extremely exciting ti me in the field of blood cancer research and treatment. In just the past year alone there has been remark able progress in treatments for patients with mul tiple myeloma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia, j ust to name two, and emerging ap proaches in immunotherapy and precision medicine that a re showing great promise. Advancing blood cancer treatments and cures also means advancin g the science and treatment of other types of cancers and certain chronic diseases as well. Si nce 2000, more than 40% of all the newly FDA approved cancer drugs were approved first for blood c ancer and many are now used to treat other forms of cancer and non-malignant diseases. At the same time, the death rate from certain blood cancers rem ains stubbornly high , with treatment protocols that haven' t changed in decades. C learly, there's muc h work still to be done in understanding the genetic underpinnings of blood cancers and fi nding new ways to correct or block those defects. The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society (LLS), the leading global organ ization dedicated to advancing blood cancer cures and access to treatment, is on the frontline s of fighting blood cancers and helping patients to access lifesav ing treatments and cures. Wit h a firm belief that changing outcomes depends on collaboration and the s haring of ideas and knowledge , LLS convened the country's leading experts in bl ood cancer research and treatment, along w ith representatives from the biopharmaceutical industry and pat ient advocacy, to explore the state of blood c ancers from their unique perspectives. Laura Landro, assistant managing editor and columnist for The Wall Street Journal , and a chronic myeloid leukemia survivor, ser ved as moderator of the roundtabl e. She engaged the panelists in a lively conversation that focu sed on several key areas: The role of collaboration among research institutions in findi ng new treatments fo r blood cancers. Advancements in precision m edicine and the impact it will have on the development of cancer treatments. Venture philanthropy as a model that can drive discovery and d evelopment of new treatments. Ways to address cos t and access to new drugs and other cancer treatments. The need to involve the patient's perspective when creating pa tient reported outcome measures. The following are moderator and panelist remarks, as well as re sponses from a lively Q&A, as recorded during the roundtable . These have been lightly edited for clarity. A video of the roundtable also can be accessed at https://youtu.be/2U-I3GV0FVA . 4 Laura Landro, Assistant Managing E ditor and Columnist, The Wall Street Journal As a survivor and as a journa list, I am fascinated by all of th e research affecting blood cancers. When I w as diagnosed nearly 25 years a go, it was a very different world. For CML , a bone marrow transplant was rea lly the only curative option, and drugs like Gleevec were still a long way o ff. Not only that, as a patient it was virtually im possible to get information. Th ere was no Internet as we know it today and no way to get information. It was very difficult to find medical literature. Cl early, a lot has changed. I think I'm as interested in this topic as an ac tivist patient. The reason I started The Wall Street Journal column \"The Informed Patient \" is because it is really important, as patients, to unders tand what's happ ening, to read the biomedical literature to the extent that it applies to your specific situation and to try to keep up with the latest research developments. I regularly plough th rough medical journals and t he American Society of Hematology abstracts to learn abou t the latest findings. Our panel represents, in a wa y, the blood canc er spectrum, from researchers to industry to clinicians to patients. I am going to ask each of them to tell us what the y believe to be the state of blood cancers, including t he most exciting thi ngs that have happened in the last year. Introduction 5 Louis DeGennaro, Ph.D., President and CEO, The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society It's never a good time to get c ancer but it's a phenomenal time to be fighting it. We're finally seeing the value in the investment that the count ry made in the Human Genome Project in the late 1990s and the early 2000s. Tha t investment is really providing value in cancer and in the blood cancers. New technologies and new methods of fi nding pathways, targeting tho se pathways, developing new therapies, new moda lities that just really didn' t exist before - this is what makes it so exciting. The pharmaceutical industry has stepped up in a tremendous way as well. There are over 900 dr ugs for cancer in clin ical development, an d nearly 300 of them for blood cancers. This is the result of the partnership between academic science driving the early discoveries and underpinnings of the causes of the diseas e paired with sign ificant pharmac eutical industry output in the development of new drugs. Patient-focused groups have had a bit of an epiphany, and they' re applying for-profit industry best practices to how they operate. T his includes organizational str ucture that leads to more efficient and effective deployment of donor dollars and ways of communica ting that provide more robust connections with pati ents. Volunteer health agencies and patien t advocate groups are recognizing for the first time the key role that they can play in bringing together the entire ec osystem around the development of new therapies for patients. Organizations like T he Leukemia & Lymphoma Society can bring together academic re search, the regulatory agencies, the payers, the pat ients, and the pharmaceutical industry in a way that can promote collaboration and yield an acceleration of new therapies. Chapter 1: Progress and Promise in Fighting Blood Cancers 6 Kenneth Anderson, M.D., Program Director, Jerome Lipper Multiple Myeloma Center and Le Bow Institute for Myeloma Therapeutics, Institute Physician , Dana-Farber Cancer Institute ; Kraft Family Professor of Medicine, Harvard Medical School I've worked at Dana-Farber Cance r Institute for more than 35 ye ars on a disease called multiple myeloma, which , when I started out, was a fatal bone marrow cancer and people died in only a few months . Now it's often a c hronic illness in many patients, and su rvival has extended at least three- to fou r-fold, with much more promise in the future. So the question is, why focus on blood cancers? Just to remind everyone, the first t reatment of blood cancer\u2014for cancer in general\u2014was in the blood cancer acute lymp hoblastic leukemia (ALL). The principles of how we use convent ional chemotherapy were all est ablished in blood cancers. It's only appropriate that blood cancers, a s a model system, can now lead the way towards progress much more generally in cancer. In that regard, there are two tr ends that have re ally made a di fference. What happened in multiple myeloma in the last year? Ever ything did. In the past 12 years we have had 16 FDA approved treatments; but in the last y ear, we've had seven new treatment s in multiple myeloma and four new drug classes, an indoor world record in multiple myeloma. What's the significance of that ? It's obvious. Patients are goi ng to do much, much better as a consequence, forevermore. The r eason it happened is the transla tion of science from the bench to the bedside, an unprece dented knowledge of t he mechanisms of ca ncer that are occurring inside of the cancer cell at the leve l of the genes, what we call epigene tics. Secondly, an understanding of the microenvironment; we've been able to make model systems targeti ng not only the cancer cell directly but also targeting t he mechanisms that allow that tumo r cell to live and grow and survive in the bone marrow. Besides this precision medicine emphasis is t he huge emphasis o n immune therapies understanding what it is in the host that may help us to restore the ability of the patient to reject his or her cancer. Precision medicine and immunother apies are, to me, the most exc iting trends for the future. How progress is being made is akin to a team sport. The team in cludes those that do academic research, both laborat ory and clinical. The second members of t he team are the biotech and pharmaceutical companies. The funder s of research, which includ e LLS and National Institutes of Health and other sources, are part of the team as are the regul ators, who often are not given enough credit. I must single out the FDA in terms of blood cancers bec ause they could not have been more proactive. It's not an exaggeration to say that we would not ha ve had this progress if the FDA had not had patients as their first p riority and worked double time to allow seven approvals in one year to happen. Finally, besides the investigat ors, biotech and pharma, funders of research, and regulators, the most important part of the team are t he patients who are our heroes and inspirations. That is a winning team. I think if we can apprecia te the progress we've made toge ther in the past and figure out how we can make this progress count f or patients, the future is eve n brighter than what we've seen in the recent past. Chapter 2: Moving Faster From Bench to Bedside Through Collaboration 7 Ross L. Levine, M.D., Member, Human Oncology and Pathogenics Program, Attending Physician, Leukemia Service, Department of Medicine and Laur ence Joseph Dineen Chair in Leukemia Research, Memorial Sl oan Kettering Cancer Center; Professor of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medical College I am a leukemia clinician and rese archer at Memorial Sloan Ketter ing. I decided to work on leukemia bec ause when I was a fellow at Dana Farber in Dr. Anderson's department in 2002, v irtually every patient I to ok care of who had leukemia died of t heir disease. And almost all of them died in the year that I took care of them as a trainee . That just didn't feel right; it didn't feel like a successful outcome for almost anybody. It created a sense in ma ny of us who were entering our careers of urgency, of impatienc e - the idea that we needed to do better and we needed to do better fast. For me, the tremendous moment occ urred when I was still in trai ning in Boston. I was involved in a collaborative effort through which we discovered mutations in a gene called JAK2 in a set of chronic leukemias and which we knew nothing about, and thus we were abl e to discover a new target. We worked with industry partners and academic part ners and conduct ed clinical trials to test new drugs. A drug was approved six years la ter\u2014from a discovery in 2005 to a drug in 2011. That for me, really whetted my appetite to be part o f the solution for a much bigge r group of patients with more difficult to treat diseases. So the question I asked myself is , \"how do things look right no w? How do they look for us as a field?\" I think the exciting thi ng for me is the idea that thes e individual examples\u2014and I was so fortunate at an early point in my career to be part of that\u2014wer e occasional examples. Every year or two we make a discovery and we fi nd a drug that we tailor to su bsets of patient s. Going to the American Society of Hematology ( ASH) meeting this year and walk ing around the room, there was the potential for similar discove ries in every corner of the me eting and at every lecture and every poster. It's not about finding one dr ug or one solution for all our patients, but that young, smart, engaging people and groups are finding new targets. They're nom inating new ideas, and these opportunities are just exploding in front of us. The challenge is, how do we then take this k nowledge, which is telling us that we're not treating one leukemia but many different flav ors, and how do we match that w ith lots of new drugs that work in many different ways? The exciti ng thing about ASH this year was that we're seeing success. We're seeing examples where drugs, if they're tailored to the right t arget and the right group of patients, can have massive improvements in outcome. More e ffective. Less toxic. They work in new ways. How do we take these successes and build on them and work toget her? Break down the walls. Whether you're a pati ent or a doctor or a r esearcher or a regul atory expert or at a biotech or large pharmaceutical company , how do we all break down the walls? I w as just really encouraged more than anything at ASH a t the dialogue, the i dea that everybody i s in this together. There's this incredible sense that we can ac tually all work together. To me, the thing I go home with when I'm on the plane for a meet ing like that is the sense that we're at a moment where there's discoveries and a willingness to work together to leverage those discoverie s. I really believe the time is now.Chapter 3: A Shared Sense of Urgency to Find New Therapies 8 Rena Conti, Ph.D., Assistant Profe ssor of Health Policy at The University of Chicago , Department of Pediatrics, Section of Hematology/On cology, and Department of Public Health Sciences I'm an economist at The University of Chicago, and my expertise is on drug pricing and availability. I think the thing that's happened in the past year in my world is that cancer treatment availability, affordability and, frankly, toxicity has become a major issue for patients, their insurers, their employ ers, and their families. Spending on cancer treat ment has exploded. It's high in terms of level but really it's the growth in spending that is worrisome to us all. This growth in spending is outpacing all other spending on dr eaded diseases that a re much more commo n, such as heart disease and diabetes. They also are outstri pping wage growth in the United States. The media and various politicians have been stoking the fire of outrage over cost. Much, but not all of this concern has focused on dr ug pricing. I think the averag e cost of treating a patient with leukemia is currently around $120,000 per year. It's almost as if affordability is a microcosm of the larger discontent of corporations getting rich and the little g uy is paying. Amid the media circus, there's so mething real here. I think the key fact is the following: the average median income in the United St ates is $51,000 per household. Th at is nine percent lower than its peak in 1999 and is at the same l evel as when President Reagan was in office. The recovery from the last recession has not trans lated into higher wages, and my colleague has just recently published a study suggesting that w e are experiencing a hollowi ng out of the middle class. As my mother also reminds me, fo r those elderly folks living on a fixed income, Social Security remains a major source if not the major source of income. These s eniors are livi ng on a monthly budget of approximately $1,000. W hat this means in practice is that patients are every day in this very uncomfortable pos ition where they have to face trade-offs between affording their cancer treatment and dealing with all o f the other expenses they have in their lives. We are just at the beginning o f understanding what financial to xicity really means, both in terms of its causes but also in terms of its consequences. I believe tha t only with systematic examinations of both causes and consequences can we identify potential policy s olutions that families, employers, insurers\u2014even drug c ompanies\u2014should be able to get behind to bo th make sure that patients can access these incredible miracle breakthroughs of scientific pro gress, but also no t kill incentives to innovate and bring the next G leevec into the world. Chapter 4: The Financial Toxicity of Cancer Treatment and Care 9 Michael Ybarra, M.D., Senior Director of Alliance Development, PhRMA I am an emergency physician, a lthough I want to bring the persp ective of the pharmaceutical industry as well . I work on the policy and advoc acy side at PhRMA, the trade associat ion in Washington D.C. We all experience the personal a spects of canc er and blood canc er. It's something that's affected my fam ily as well, som ething that act ually led my dad to pursue medicine. He is one of three children but his younges t brother passed away in 1958 from acute l ymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). In 1958 the survival rate was roughly thr ee percent for ALL, and in 2010 no w we're living in an age where it's 92% survival rate. That was somet hing that clearly impacted his decision to go in to medicine and led to a whole family of doctors, i ncluding myself, all pursuing di fferent specialties but really understanding that pati ents do have unmet needs. I can say that in my work at PhR MA with public policy professio nals working with our member companies, we all have that goal. W e all go to work every day b ecause we want to sustain a policy environment that allows for innovat ive therapies. That doesn't mean we don't recognize everything that's being talked about in the news. About a year ago we worked with T he Leukemia & Lymphoma Society on a quarterly medicines and development report. That report fo cused on blood cancers. It fo und that there are nearly 300 medicines in development, with abou t 250 medicines in developme nt in the pharmaceutical pipeline to treat blood cancers. If you want to look at just the science , it's monoclonal ant ibodies that target PD1 in order to treat Hodgkin's l ymphoma, new treatments for ha iry cell leukemia, antibodies for multiple myeloma, tyrosine kinase inhibitors for AML. There's i ncredible science going on. The value is clearly there. I th ink the ALL exam ple is the perf ect one. We were three percent in 1964. We're at 90% now. That does n't mean that there is not unm et need, and that doesn't mean that there are not issues. As it pertains to cost, we focus on the access and affordability issues. The things that we go to work fo r are to make sure that patient s can afford to not leave their medicine at the pharmacy count er. It doesn't benefit any of us when a patient doesn' t leave with it. I still see patients on a weekly basis and it 's something that I deal with and have to talk to my patients about. We have to follow up and make sure that we pick ed the right medicine for their insurance plan, that the co-paym ents are affordable to them; an d if they are not affordable, we have to troubleshoot and work through that. That's one of the very c hallenging parts of being a physician. I can only imagine it's even harder if you're a specialist in h ematology/oncology because my prescribing patterns are much d ifferent for a different set of medical problems. We realize that financial burde n is there and a lot of that is augmented by the c hanges that have occurred in the last five years with the Affordable Care Act. F ive years ago most patients in this country did not have a deductibl e; most patients paid a fixed c o-payment for their prescription medicines. So now we're at a time where our companies have brou ght to market incredible therapies Chapter 5: Pursuing Drug Development While Ensuring Patient Access 10 that are intended for a very sma ll patient population, on the g rand scale of drugs of the 1990s which were intended for a large number of patients in the country. Ma ny people at some point are going to be on a statin, for example. These new medicines are incredibl y targeted. They take incredib le science to bring them to market. They're for a small patient popul ation. That-coupled with the f act that now patient s are faced with very high out of pocket costs because their pl ans are designed in such a way tha t they have to meet a certain deductible --they have to get to that deductible, and so they go to the pharmacy counter and they have to pay hundreds of dollars out of pocket. If you're o n a fixed income, that is clearly a challenge. We recognize the financ ial burdens and we advocate f or things that will hopefully make medicines more affordable for patients so they will be able to have the medicine that can hopefully bring a cure. Just to put the overall cost i n context, in 2014 spending on ca ncer medicine was roughly one percent of all healthcare spending. For an extremely, obviously very si ck population, this i s high stakes medicine. This is incredibly im portant. In terms of solutions, we want to be a part of the solution. We think innovation is part of t he solution. Targeted therapies that work for patients are a good investment. If we know the therap y is going to work for that sp ecific patien t, that is a good investment. We really believe in the competitive market and we want to make sure that patients benefit from the competitive ma rket, and are able to benefit fr om the negotiations that our companies have with pharmacy benefit managers. Generic and brand com petition help k eep spending in check. We t hink that insur ance should be adequate and should be a ffordable, and we wan t to make sure tha t patients are not subject to excessive cost sharing. We've all experienced that. I personall y have experienced that when medical claims, hospitalization, are mor e expensive than prescription m edicines. We've all been there. Our member companies have stepped up to the plate in terms of p atient assistance programs. Partnership for Prescription Assi stance (PAP) is PhRMA's overar ching patient assistance program. We've helped almost 10 million peopl e access their medicines ju st through PAP alone. 11 Susan Love, M.D., M.B.A., Chief Vis ionary Officer, Dr. Susan Love Research Foundation I have a unique pers pective because I spen t most of my career a s a breast cancer surgeon. I started out a t Dana Farber. I was at UCLA. I' ve done research. I'm an author and an advocate and a general rabble-ro user. Then all of a sudden about three and a half y ears ago, I was diagnosed w ith acute myeloid leukemia (AML). I was f eeling perfectly fine. I had a r outine blood test and got called back. \"Come righ t back to the hospital. You have 30% blasts in your blood.\" I'm a breast cancer surgeon. I couldn't even remem ber what blasts were. I'm driving back to the docto r's office asking myself, \"W hat does that mean?\" I ended up being hospita lized and I had chem otherapy, which fai led me. We often say you failed chemotherapy. I say, \"No, chemother apy failed me.\" We sometimes lose track of that. I ended up with a bone marrow transplant from my younger sister, who is 12 years younger, so I figure that gives me a new lease in life. It was a very humbling and eye-ope ning experience. I was really amazed at what a crude way to treat a disease that really has n't changed since I was in train ing in medical sc hool when I graduated in 1974. It's really treated about t he same way as it was then, which is high dos e chemotherapy and then try to recover by giving y ou a transplant. It's like the r adical mastectomy. We've gone a lot further in breast cancer in te rms of figuring out targeted ther apies in different ki nds of breast cancer but in some ways you could ar gue that the bone marrow transplan t is the original immunotherapy because of the graft versus leukem ia effect. In some ways it's really archaic, and in some ways it's novel and moving forward. The really big surprise to me o f the whole experience was what I call the collateral damage. When you're a doctor looking at a pat ient with cancer you compare th em to the people who died, and you're patting yourself on the back for having done such a grea t job. When you're the patient, you're comparing yourself to how you we re before. You're acutely aware of the price you've paid to be here. You're happy to be here bu t you're very aw are of the peri pheral neuropathy and the chemo- brain and all the other cons equences, which we euphemistically call side effects . But they're not side effects. Side effects are temporary. That's like throwing up when you get chemo. These are permanent. It's more like you're in a car crash and you get you r car fixed but that passenger door never opens the same away again as it did when it was new. That 's how your body is afterwards. As we're making more progress in treating these cancers, we hav e to start paying much more attention to the collateral dam age. Not just acknowledging it b ut also doing resear ch on it because maybe the same precision medici ne that's allowing us to direct some of our treatments more precisely may be able to tell us w ho's more susceptible to a ce rtain side effect or consequence. We never really look at that. We shoul d be starting to look at whe ther people who have dementia in their family get more chemo-brain. M aybe if you have restless legs yo u get more peripheral neuropathy because you have some k ind of nerve issue. M aybe there's a gene tic marker that c ould predict that. Chapter 6: The Collateral Damage of Cancer Treatment 12 Both in the breast cancer world a nd now as an advocate in the L LS world, there's a movement to do patient reported outcomes. My co mplaint about this is that the patient reported outcomes are coming from questionnaires developed by doctors or res earchers for pat ients to fill out. There are only the questions that the doctors know about or are interested in and they miss the things that actually are happening to the patient. We've got to start asking patient s directly so they can really be patient reported outcomes. What are the things that are bothering t hem and interfering with their l ives? We're trying to do this with my non-profit foundation on b reast cancer but it's something that I would advise everybody in pharma and research to be thinking about a s well. Otherwise we're goin g to save all t hese lives and our statistics will look great but t he patients will be feeling ter rible and not that functional. That's not what we want. 13 Erin Zammett Ruddy, Author, Blogger, Survivor I am a patient survivor. I wa s diagnosed 14 year s ago when I wa s 23 with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML ). I didn't have any symptoms. I went in and had a blood test, and they c alled me back. A bone marrow biopsy confirmed that I had CML. Hearing you have canc er at 23 is obviously devastating, but thi s was November of 2001, which was six months a fter Gleevec was approved by the FDA. It actually was a really good time to be fighting CML because I wa s able to get right on the drug. I went to Oregon Health and Sciences Univers ity and met Brian Druker and his colleague, M ichael Mauro. They were runnin g trials at the time to see if they could make Gleevec more effi cient, so I wound up doing a trial combination of Gleevec and Ara-C injections that I gave mysel f. I was terrible at it and I hated it but it was a small price to pay. I wound up doing really well. Gleevec was being touted as a mi racle drug, and for me it was a miracle. Within a little over a year of my diagnosis I was in complete molecular remission. I was li ving a normal life. I really didn't have major side effects at all but lit erally on the same day that Dr . Mauro called me to say that I was in remission, my sister called and told me that she had been diagn osed with Hodgkin's lymphoma. She was 27 at the time and seven months pregnant. We were back to square one and t here is no magic pill for Hodgk in's lymphoma. So she went through the grueling treatmen t, chemo and radiat ion while she w as pregnant and then after. She relapsed after ten m onths and went into Me morial Sloan Ketterin g and spent a month there having a bone marrow transplant. It was a cra zy time for all of us, for our family, but she did incredibly well. The little boy that she was pregnan t with is now a whip-smart s eventh grader and the star of his baseball team. She was able to hav e two more kids post-transpla nt and they're all fantastic. She's doing great. As for me, I have three childr en and I was able to stop Gleevec three different times to have them. I was one of the first people to do this so I do communicate a lot now with people wh o want to go off the drug and have babies. I work ed very closely with Dr. Druker and Dr. Mauro. We thought about it and made the decision to do i t. I went off for about ten months each time and my c ancer never came back. Those little mini experim ents, as we refer to them, are w hat led me to make the decision a few months ago to join a discontinuation trial that they're running at Memorial Sloan Kettering. Michael Mauro has since moved fr om OHSU to Memorial Sloan Kette ring, which worked out well for me, so I didn't have to go to Oregon anymore to see him. In November, 14 years almost to the day that I was diagnosed, I took my last dos e of Gleevec and what I hope will be my last dose of Gleevec. I'm a writer and I wrote an article where I talked about grappling with the decision. G leevec was so good to me. I owe m y life to Gleevec. I know how lucky I am to have had a pill to treat m y cancer. I didn't have to go t hrough what so many other people have gone through, what my sister wen t through. So I rea lly grappled with it. I felt like I was looking a gift Chapter 7: The Patient Perspective: Life After Successful Treatment 14 horse in the mouth. I didn't have too many side effects to spea k of. In the article, I said it was like breaking up with a great guy. \" Hey Gleevec, it's not you, it's me.\" I was at Memorial Sloan Ketteri ng yesterday and I had my third blood test, so it's month three since I've been off. The name of the st udy is the LAST study, Life Af ter Stopping TKIs. It' s exciting to be a part of this trial. I feel like I was part of the original Glee vec story 14 years ago and now to be part of what could be the next chapter, I'm excited. I felt I owed it t o myself to see what life is like off of medication and to the cancer co mmunity to see if this could be the next step. I will say that the past 14 years have been very lucky for my s ister and me. We know that there are a lot of people who aren't as lucky , which is why I have devote d my life to LLS and to being around people who are doing the same thing. It's an honor. 15 John Byrd, M.D., D. Warren Brown Chair of Leukemia Research; Professor of Medicine and Medicinal Chemistry and Director, Division of Hemat ology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State Unive rsity Wexner Medical Center I'm a hematologist and a physici an scientist tha t does most of his science in the clinic and in the bedside . My area of research is chroni c lymphocytic leukemia, and I'm drifting back now to acute myeloid leukemia. I'll introduce CLL and then go to what I think are the most exc iting things that have happened this year and the promises to come. CLL is t he most common adult leukemia in terms of prevalence and there's not a curative therapy for this. For decades, there was not an effectiv e therapy\u2014we h ad chemotherapy , but it palliated the disease. It didn't prolong survival. At about the same time Gleevec was coming into the clinic for C ML, there was the fi rst targeted drug tested in CLL called rituximab . We were blessed to be part of t he team that introduced that in CLL and combined it with chemotherapy . We want to get rid of chemot herapy in CLL. We want to prolong survival in a meaningful way. A s ignificant thing that came for th this year were three publications published in the journal Blood that showed that when you add ri tuximab, a targeted therapy, t o chemotherapy in a subset of CLL patients you c an potentially cu re their disease. A 14 year follow up showed no CLL after receiving th is combination, so that's a str iking finding. Unfortunately, I hear what Dr. Love said about the after effect s because when you look at the long- term follow up of this treatment i n the patients that were cure d of their CLL, they were left with a high frequency of secondary c ancers that ultimatel y compromised thei r potential to ge t on with life and stop worrying about another cancer . That really emphasizes the importance of moving forward with other approaches. The second group of targeted ther apies for CLL was Bruton's tyr osine kinase or The first trials with ibrutinib started in 2009 , which we didn't think was going to work because, unlike CML, CLL doesn't have a single target. Every one said it was unlikely tha t one precise medi cine was going to work. I heard that from 1997 wh en I started as an attending phy sician. In fact, ibrutinib threw away t hat doubt. It started in trials in 2009. We saw dram atic responses in very refractory CLL patients ta king a pill once a day and often coming from hospice. I am here as the person that's treated 300 or more patients with this drug and h ave heard patients say this drug not only gave them their lives back but it made them feel the way t hey did before CLL. For some of the patients that were in the early trials, it also set them up to have more money while they were living with CLL because they saw the dr ug was effective and they bough t stock in the company. That brings us to now. Where do we get to with ibrutinib in 201 5 and beyond? There was a very exciting study presented at the annual ASH meeting describing t he RESONATE-2 study, which looked at ibrutinib as a first- line therapy vers us chlorambucil , which is the first chemotherapy used in CLL. It's not very good, but they looked at this in elderly pat ients. Of course, ibrutinib beat the socks Chapter 8: Advancements in CLL 16 off of chemotherapy. Very favor able side effects. Very favorabl e outcome. Improved survival. All the endpoints that doctors look at. What I found most inspiring abou t that study is an analysis tha t's very similar to analyses that I've seen with CML. Patient s can go on a pill, and they have to stay on a pill. We're not quite wrestling with the question of s topping ibrutinib yet, but we're already talking about doing i t in patients that have done real well. They can liv e potentially as long as they would without CLL. That same story has been true with Gleevec, and so that was a very inspiring fi nding. The long-term follow-up is not s howing a lot of t he \"chemo-brai n\" side effects and other bad side effects. In fact, it's showing that these targeted drugs may ma ke the immune system work better. Why is that exciting? Because we've heard a lot of excitement a bout immune therapies, the checkpoint inhibitors, the CAR T-cells. In fact, these drugs ma ke the CAR T-cells, which could have the potential to cure CLL, work even better. CLL has taught us that targeted therapies can work across a disease if y ou have a good drug and you have a target that spares normal tissue. Looking forward in this disease, we're seeing the same second generatio n medicines that may take away some of the side effect s of ibrutinib. We heard about acalabrut inib and other targeted drugs where we might be able to give two or three targeted or immune therap ies together to put patients in complete remission and cure them o f the disease without chemoth erapy's long-term adverse events. 17 Laura Landro : It's very encouraging to hear ab out all the collaboration that' s going on, to know that there are big groups worki ng on AML. We all know that ther e's another big blood cancer collaborative going on in the c ountry, another moonshot. Also, to hear how the FDA has been so cooperative. I actually just reviewed a book by Dr. Vince DeVita, which is i n many ways the opposite of everything that's been said. No one collabor ates. It's all institutions tr ying to get their ow n papers published and get their own drugs out there and that the FDA process for doin g this is totally flawed and needs to be completely overhau led. I'm curious with some of the folks th at are dealing with this at the comprehensive cancer centers. I s that wrong? Is that changing? Is that the way it w as and is it better now, particularly in the blood cancers? Dr. Byrd : Having seen the FDA at work with ibrutinib, which was so impact ful to patients, every day that drug wasn't approved pati ents were going to die. So the FD A worked hand-in-hand with the pharmaceutical companies. I've been warned not to say this beca use they're in the government and they could get in trouble. They w orked when they weren't suppos ed to be working to make this drug available and to communicate. T here are some barriers that they have because they have to work within the law. Changing the law o f how drugs get approved is g oing to help them work, but they get the blame and they're really tr ying to approve good drugs. We h eard that as well for acute leukemia. Dr. Anderson : I also want to cheer for the FDA . What's happened at the level of the FDA\u2014and it has changed\u2014is a recognition of a whole new field called regula tory science, so that those who work at the FDA are every bit as motivated to make progress for patients. What this regulatory science field means is that they learn about the diseases. They learn about what would be a good clinical trial to s how, on the one hand, efficacy and, on the o ther hand, lack of side effects. Once a drug looks promising, t hey work double time to make sure that this gets a very rapid review. We have new breakthrou gh status at the FDA . Part of the excitem ent is now that we have these new targeted agents in all of the blood cancers, t he endpoints that were relevant even the last year or two in terms of how long people live without active cancer are not so useful anymore to try to develop a new medicine. People are living many, many years. That's a wond erful outcome. If you have a new medicine and you want to get i t approved in blood cancer and yo u're working in tech, biotech or pharma, we can't wait. Most importantly, the patients can't wait. With blood cancers, our goal in clinical tr ials is to identify new biomarkers so we can better predict whether a patient is go ing to survive 10 or 15 years and then connect those pati ents with the most e ffective therapies. The FDA could not be more passionately and personally committ ed to patients with blood ca ncers. Ms. Landro : Well, that's interesting to hear. A s I said, it seems to me eve rything gets approved in Europe first. Dr. Ybarra : I just want to add the industry perspective here, which is in a greement. I tend to be a glass half-full person. We are working collabor atively but ther e are always ways t hat we could break down more barriers. Industry does p lay a key role in trying to build bridges with academia. The funding piece is really critica l. The biopharmaceutical industr y's contribution to the funding of Chapter 9: Questions and Answers 18 research is really importan t. Grant writing and grant requests are clearly important from the NIH, but the industry is abou t $51 billion per year in R&D spending. Tha t's really critical. In terms of ways that we could im prove the process, just breaki ng down barriers and improving the clinical trials, we are active i n the regulatory process for de veloping and validating biomarkers. A clear and transparent regulatory framework and incorporation of more diverse dat a sets could be helpful. Dr. Levine : I just want to pick up on the ot her question you asked, which w as the issue of silos that Laura mentioned in reference to D r. DeVita, who has had as big an impact on patients with lymphoma as probably anybody in th e history of the disease; we should not forget his impact on the development of modern chemother apy for Hodgkin's disease. The reality is that we all re cognize that in academia, any indu stry, and any job, t here's an aspect of feeling the need for individual accomplishment. That is part of what makes this country great. None of us wants to ever discourage people from wanting to do the be st they can. The mantra that I believe more and more and wha t I see happening over and over ag ain is the idea that if what we do has impact\u2014if we do it together , there's more than enough credi t and success to go around. What I see are more and more examples of all kinds of fl avors, differe nt academic institutions that didn't work together before, differen t companies working together, exa mples of public and private partnerships. This idea that when success becomes likely it cre ates a culture where the end result for everybody's individual career s and for our patients is much , much greater than if we went out by ourselves. I think that, combined with the idea of big data, we need to no t just look at our 20 patients in our center that have AML in the past six months but develop data se ts and ask what happens not just at Memorial Sloan Kettering or Da na-Farber or Ohio State, but w hat happens in a private practice around the corner from Memorial Sloan Kettering that treats as many AML patients as we do. By combining our forces to understand what we learn from every pat ient we treat, we're going to learn a lot more. It's going to take time. It's some thing that many of us really believe in, that LLS has been pushing us to do. I really be lieve that that's a cul tural change that's already occurring and has to continue to occur. It's some thing that we have to c ontinue to talk about ve ry openly because it's something that we have to push ourselves, all o f us, to continue to do better. Dr. Love : I think that's true, but I think one of the things we're going to have to do too is make the rewards be rewards to teams and not individuals. When the prize s are all to individuals\u2014as are tenure and promotions \u2014all the rewards are still individual-base d. If we're really going to be able to incorporate that teamwork, we' re going to have to change the re ward system. Ms. Landro : This gets into the i dea of venture philanthropy. There are a lo t of interesting things going on in that field, but people are certainly skeptical abou t it. You see things i n other diseases like the Alzheimer's Drug Discovery F oundation. That is the original \"we're just going to give money to people who are working on the discovery of d rugs.\" Is that a mo del that fits into your thinking about the future of blood cancers discovery? Dr. Anderson : I absolutely think so. Part o f this issue about who gets credit , is honestly, to me, a real discussion, but i t's kind of an empty discussion until som eday these diseas es are cured. Then we can actually give credit, es pecially to the patients who enr olled in the trials. To be honest, the system right now for developing a new medicine from the bench t o the bedside really needs improvement. The idea that Dr. Levine or Dr. Byrd and I or othe rs in biotech and pharma are trying 19 to do new science and find a new ta rget is absolutely real. The entrepreneurial spirit in that regard is a good thing. Much of it is goi ng on in the U.S. When you find a new target and it's validated in preclinical systems, our syste m is that it then goes from the b ench to the bedside. Honestly, until recently the idea woul d be we would find a target and then we w ould look around the world and hope that there was a biotech or big pharmaceutical t hat had a drug already or would put in the commitment to try to help make it. That still goes on, and I don' t want to at all downplay the rol e of biotech and phar ma because it's essential in order to take this scientific advance and, as I li ke to say, make it count for patients in terms of improving diagnosis , prognosis, or treatment. I want t o sing the praises of Dr. Louis DeGennaro and The Leuk emia & Lymphoma Society. In this model of venture philanthropy, the idea is that now when a new finding comes along and Dr. Levine or I or Dr. Byrd finds something novel that we can move closer to the bedside than ever before; it can happen through a program called the Therapy Acceleration Program. Through this venture philanthrop y prototype, medicines can be m ade. We're involved in a very wonderful, successfu l effort now with LLS that, when that medic ine becomes successful, will put funds back into LLS. This will be a machine that will keep maki ng sure that the new good ideas that are rigorously validated actua lly get to patients. We're doing similar efforts now with a vaccine that also looks quite awesome. Just a s you've heard about in terms o f the wonderful science around precision medicine and immunotherapies, we do not need to be th inking about credit; that's the last thing we need to be thinking about. We need to be thinking abou t how we can make sure at this unprecedented time in science tha t we keep the promise that we made to patients, that we take the best science and make sure we get advances to them at the bedsi de most quickly. That is a very innovative program that LLS is leading. I want to really thank them for that effort. Dr. DeGennaro : I mentioned there had been an epiphan y in the not-for-profit wo rld. I think this is part of it. Charities that are i nvolved in funding research in diseases have recognized that in order to really succeed in their mission , the mission being new therapie s for patients, cures for patients, they need to be involved acro ss the entire spectrum of the process o f actually getting those drugs to patients. It's not just supporting academic research. There's a vital component that the industry is involved in, and t hat's part of it. It's also interplay with the Food and Drug Administration. The reality is, as a not-for-profit, we have an entr\u00e9e to the FDA to provide t hem with unbiased information and education in a way that many folks don't. That's an important part of our role; likewise, wi th regulators and, of course, with patients as well. When you begin to thin k about the entire ecosystem of bringing a therapy, potentially a cure, to patients there's a true role for organizations like LLS in d oing that. Venture philanthropy is certainly a part of it, and we're proud to be a leader in that arena. We're proud to be a leader around that entire ecosystem. I can't help but be struck by t he tremendous advances in scienc e that we're di scussing. There's great opportunity in the futu re. Yet we heard a lot about acces s issues. I think it's important to note that if patients don't have acce ss to these lifesaving therapie s none of us in the room have done our jobs. Ms. Landro : I was talking with Ms. Ruddy ear lier about the co sts of these d rugs. When I had a bone marrow transplant it cost a quar ter of a million dollars in 199 2. I don't know what it's up to now, and later, when I had to take Gleevec for a relapse, it was a $30 c o-pay. I think Ms. Ruddy, you said that yours was $50. As a patient wit h insurance you don't think abou t these things as much, but, as 20 you've said, Dr. Conti, that's v ery much a problem for many peo ple. We're privileged to have been able to have these therapi es without those concerns. What is the solution? There are ways people can get help, but i s it enough and wha t model can you take to do all this great biom edical research, invest all this money, and then get access. What are the things that we can do for this? Dr. Conti : The price of bone marrow transpl ant actually hasn't changed, wh ich is good news. But I think there are a couple of i ssues. The first is that although there's a lot of focus on the cost of the drugs, that is not the only componen t of cost that patients are feeling. Specifica lly, we just published a study suggesting that it's also the site of care that really determines how much pat ients are actually facing in terms of out of pocke t costs, because academic medica l centers and ot her consolidated institutions frankly, charge higher prices. Those prices trickl e down to what patients actually have to pay out of pocket. We know that this is an issue, bu t we actually don't know how b ig of an issue it is. While we've heard a lot of stories about access bei ng an issue, t here has been no national systemati c examination of exactly how many pati ents and what proporti on of patients facin g specific diagnoses are actually having trouble with paying for t heir drugs or paying for their treatment more generally. Exactly what types of treatments are they bei ng offered financial assistance for, and what types of treatments they are not being offered finan cial assistance for? We also don't know what the conseque nces are for patients facin g this type of toxicity. For example, we don't know whether for specif ic patients they are selling th eir house or their car or borrowing money or taking money out of thei r kids' education fund to affo rd this therapy. We need to know that so we can actually th ink about solutions. Then, finally, we don't really know how patients trade off thes e things. It is entirely possible that patients in their last months o f life are very willing to spend all of the rest of the money they have for a cure or for even a handful o f months to be with their childre n and grandchildren. My colleagues and I are partnering with LLS to examine what the contours of f inancial toxicity are. We're very excited about that. Ou r guiding principle is the following: the re are really no bad actors in the system. There are just a lot of differ ent actors who make a lot of mone y off the healthcare system as it exists now. That includes physicians, hospitals, pharma, insurers and others. All of these institut ions are acting on t he current incentives that they face. If we change the incentives and make patient affo rdability the central focus or a central value I think we will be able to find some attainable solutions t hat will actually move this bal l forward. Dr. Love : I want to add that it's not just d rug costs, as Dr. Conti point ed out, but it's also getting the test, the follow-up test, the x -rays, the scans, the whatever. All of those add up. Sometimes we focus just on the cost of drugs, bu t the MRI that you're getting for follow up or the PET scan or whatever is also just as expensive. Dr. Conti : Absolutely, and the nature of wor k is changing. There are a lot of people who are consultants or who are day laborers now, so missing that day of work to take your mother to the hospital for the nth test that they need\u2014 Dr. Love : Which they may really not need, but it's just our habit to do. 21 Dr. Conti : Those are real costs , and those costs need to be figured in and really understood so we can actually think about where t he rubber is meeting the road i n terms of affordabilit y. Maybe it's not the treatment itself but it's a ll the care surrounding the trea tment. Ms. Landro : Obviously, this is universal for a ll cancers. I'd like to steer it back just to the blood cancers for a moment. I was thin king often\u2014and I'm sure that as leukemia survivors you get these calls as well\u2014somebody calls me and says my friend has been dia gnosed with leukemia. I'll ask, what kind? Because it 's either okay you're going to be fine or it's going to be r eally a tough road. I guess the question is w hy has the prognosis for some been so mu ch better? In CLL I know for many years people didn't even treat i t sometimes. It would just be a long smoldering dis ease that went on. In CML you went from bone marrow transplants to Gleevec and oth er drugs like it. In AML there are treatments, but often they fail. W hat are we missing here in ge tting better treatments? Why is there not the revolution in AML that t here has been in multiple myelo ma or CML? I think most people don't understand that t he blood cancers are so many different o nes, and some are kind of refractory to treatment. Dr. Levine : The way I see the challenge in AML is that it's a very unique d isease and opportunity because if you look at it from t he lens of a scientist, if you look at it from the lens of a doctor, if you look at it from the lens of a pat ient, we know that it's not on e disease. We know that it's probably between 10 and 20 dist inct diseases that we lump together using very crude tools and we call it AML. That is important because even a disease like breast cance r where we recognize there's heterogeneity, it's probably, if y ou believe the scientists, fo ur or five distinct subgroups. AML, which is rarer and more complex a nd where there's more urgency to treat, is 20 subtypes. How do we recognize t hose 20 subtypes accu rately and quickly so that we can actually tell a patient within days of treatment that \" you don't just have AML; you hav e this kind of AML , and this kind of AML needs this kind of treatment.\" The challenge in front of us is how do we put the rubber to the road? Right now in the clinic, we' ve been using the same drugs for more than four decades. We're using them in all 20 subtypes. We all know , whether we know all of the different nuances of the genomes, that that makes no sens e. I thought it was really exci ting at ASH that we're seeing examples in big and small trials of tailoring treatments to dif ferent subtypes. That's the era we're entering. In AML, I really believe the good news is that between the 20 s ubgroups, the different players, the different genes, the different pat hways, we actually know a tre mendous amount. I'm not saying we don't need to do more sequencing, but we actually can take an a malgam. There's a lot of data out there. I think we're actually at a great moment in AML where we need to just break down the walls and begin. We need to stop thinki ng of it as one disease and st art building the infrastructure to identify the subgroups i n real practice and ma tch them up with drugs. If we don't start doing it, we're not doing a service for anybod y. To me, that's the challenge in front of us. AML is the perfect disease test for the precisi on medicine concept. Dr. Byrd : I would agree with what Dr. Levin e said and just want to add th at you can understand the biology and that there are 20 s ubtypes, but if you still have t he therapies that are v ery similar to what were used 40 years ago, you're not going to make a lot of progr ess. I think the ex citing thing right now is that we're at a point wher e for all of those different s ubtypes of AML we have drugs that can rationally be directed toward a h ypothesis. In this group, is t his drug going to work, produce a meaningful benefit, and have a quick answer doi ng a study in 10 or 15 patients initially versus 300? Moving on, if a drug doesn't initi ally work but can subsequentl y generate impressive data, we will hopefully be able to go to the FD A and say, \"Yes, we have a win ner.\" 22 Taking this approach really embodies thinking about developing drugs differently. One has to almost throw out the concept of a Phase III study, where you treat hun dreds and hundreds of patients and randomize to a drug that you al ready know works well to somethi ng you don't know if it works well, because it's going to take a lot o f time. A lot of patients are going to die with the disease while you're completing that study with a ve ry effective drug. I think we're at a point in precis ion medicine where we can do that. AML is the best disease to do it in. Dr. Levine : The other corollary or net effect if we begin to embrace that a pproach is the cost of doing the trials to get a drug approved can pot entially be redu ced dramatically. W e always talk about the need to recover the investment that we make in developing d rugs when we talk about the price of drugs. This idea that one thi ng we need to do is talk frankl y about how can we reduce the cost of getting a drug approv ed because the coro llary of that should be \u2014and I believe is\u2014that then the cost of using that drug after appr oval should decrease. If we all ta lk about that as bei ng a goal and not just a net effect of unexpect ed benefit, then we raise the dial ogue and bring this issue up earlier in the process and not just a fter the drug is approved. Dr. Conti : I'm a naysayer on that argumen t. Fundamentally, the costs of R& D have nothing to do with the prices that are set fo r drugs. They'r e not connected. We know that the costs of or the prices of drugs are not connected to how much it costs to make that ad ditional vial or that additional pill, but all the costs of development. T hey might as well not exist when a pharmaceutical company is actually pricing the drug. Pharma ceutical compani es have every incentive to profit maximize. What I mean by that is that they price based on the willingness of pay ers to pay for these therapies. If we change the willingness to pay for these therapies, prices will come down, but if we change the cost of R&D I don't expect that p rices will go down. Dr. Anderson : The real cost that we're talki ng about is for patients. The cos t is whatever number you want to call it, but its sev en to ten or some outrageous nu mber of years to take what looks like a promising lead and get it to approv al to patients. That's the c ost we're talking about. I think that's really the promise of precision medicine. To do a selected tria l of an agent that's highly likely to work in a small number of patients and save not only financial costs , but saving mont hs and years for patients. I will remind everyone that Gleev ec was probably one of the fir st examples of precision medicine. The approval came on a Phase I trial. There was no need to do a Phase II and Phase III trial. Ms. Landro : By the way, that was very much dri ven by extreme patient activi sm. Dr. Anderson : I think it's a critical part of the process. Ms. Landro : We wrote all about it in The Wall Street Journal . Dr. Anderson : That is more important today than ever. The other thing in prec ision medicine\u2014and you read about the moons hot on precision m edicine\u2014it's actually the right medicine for the right patient at the right time, but it' s not as simple as let's just give one medicine to this patient at this time. It includes the immune ther apies. It includes combination s\u2014so not only one medicine but a second medicine given in combination to pre vent the escape rout e that the cancer is going to try to use to resist the first medica tion. I think what we're getting at is precision medi cine is going to allow for the pooling of data for rare diseases, which is necessary i f we're going to define the subsets in already rare orphan diseases. W ith a community of data we will be able to deliver on the promise, whether it be a comb ination of targeted medicines or an immune therapy, to deliver on the promise of taking the science and maki ng it count for patients. 23 Ms. Landro : One of the things that we haven 't talked about is the idea of w hen therapies no longer work\u2014patients have become resi stant or the medication has faile d you. People do become resistant to Gleevec, and then of course ther e were other drugs that were lined up right behind that. I know at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer C enter where I had my transplant, th ey often see pati ents for whom Gleevec and other dr ugs stopped working. T hen they come back fo r transplants. I'm sort of curious about the i dea of bone marrow transplants. They aren't talked about as much as many of the drugs. We know that t hey're still out there. It's a pretty rough thing to go through, though I know they're working on mini transplants and less toxic ways to use the immune system. Is that still a promising area? Are you still thinking about transplant ation as a key c omponent of these blood cancers? Dr. Byrd : Transplantation for AML is pro bably the best therapy we have ri ght now. The problem is\u2014and we just looked at 1,600 patients, a data set carried fro m the late 1990s to now\u2014only about 15 to 20% of patients are getti ng to transplant. There are a va riety of reasons for that. The therapy we give before breaks them down to a point where you can't get them into shape for transplant. There's insurance. There's donors . But what's exciting is that we're at a point where there's really no patient that you shouldn't be abl e to find a donor for, especia lly if they have a brot her, sister or child. Ms. Landro : That has amazingly evolved, yes. Dr. Byrd : The biggest promise I see for th is is it allows you to say, as soon as the pat ient comes in the door, we're going to take that patient to transplant. Th is is going to be your donor, and you're going to be able to get more pat ients to transplant. I looked a t targeted agents as well, they offer great opportunity to integrate wi th this because if you can giv e somebody a pill that puts their disease in remission and doesn't m ake them have to stay in the hospital for 28 days, that's a lot cheaper, they're in goo d shape going into t he transplant, and t hey're going to do better. There's still a lot of work being done in trans plant and other types of cellu lar therapies that have come from that. Dr. Levine : Stem cell transplantation is par t of an emerging area that's bu ilding on the success of transplantation by using immune cells to treat blood cancers - this can be a bone ma rrow transplant using stem cells or a patient's own T-ce lls or even antibodies that recruit T-cells; there are a variety of modifications of the transpl ant regimen. The idea that the i mmune system is exquisitely active and able to kill blood cancer cells and in many cases cure patients is really a modality we want to use and improve and optimize and make a part of an integrated appro ach. One of the exciting things about it is the idea that it give s the potential for cure. We w ant to get patients to these exciting new immune modalities earlier on in t herapy because, whenever we ca n, we want people to get therapies and then be done, as you heard about earlier about stopping Gle evec. We don't want, when possible, to have patients main tained on drugs if they don't ne ed them, with the ca veats that there may be long term effects even i f they're off therapy. I think o ne of the exciting th ings about transplant is the idea that we have patient s that get these therapies and then a year or two years later are off therapy and doing really well. It is something that we hadn't s een and I think it is really an exciting time. Now the question is, how do we extend the paradigm, more diseases, earlier on in therapies, access, and how do we do this no t just at rarified cancer cente rs but in a broad s pectrum of patients everywhere, not just in t he U.S. but worldwide? Dr. Byrd : We were talking about venture philanthropy, and the cellular th erapy that Dr. Levine is talking about, the CAR-T cells, is something tha t nobody though t would work. So it is not the pharma companies that kept this alive so it could blossom into a thera py that works across all cancers, its LLS supporting Carl June's initial work with the CAR-T cells at The University of Pennsylvania. So it 24 gets back to part of what we're talking about here: the importa nce of LLS in supporting these early therapies that expand to a lo t of other types of cancers. Dr. Anderson : The transplant therapy idea is so exciting. Getting a stem cell transplant from a brother or a sister or an unrela ted donor wor ks because you get the person's new immune system that rejects the cancer; in A LL and other settings this has led to cure. It's just w e haven't been able to do it from inside the pati ent, him or herself, before. This is a case where we are lear ning from our colleagues in sol id tumors about the concept of the checkpoint inhibitor. The idea is that the immune system is und er this elegant system of regulatory control and there's a camouflage PDL1 on the tumor that interac ts with something called PD1 on the immune effector cell that i s programmed to kill that tumor, and it is a brake when those two molecules interact. If you take the brake off with checkpoint i nhibitors in melanom a and lung cancer, and other solid tumors - wonderful results have been achieved. It is happening now in blood cancers too. The reason I mention it is the t eam combination approach. We ha ve immunomodulatory drugs, especially in myeloma, that work by turning on the patient's im mune system. We have antibodies, as Dr. Levine mentioned, that ta rget the tumor cells and then t hey recruit the patient's own immune system to selectively reject t hem. We have checkpoint inhibitor s that take the brakes off the immune system. We have vaccines and we h ave cellular therapies. But th e exciting thing is when you use them in combinations. And we're doing this with LLS with a vacc ine in combination ; in early data it looks like you can get a memor y immune response in the patie nts themselves against their own cancers. Just to make sure everybody app reciates the significance of tha t, if you get vacci nated for tetanus or smallpox or whatever else, the reason you never get that diseas e if you're exposed is your immune system remembers and rejects it. What if we could do that in a patient against his own cancer? Why is it so good? It's potent, it's s elective and it 's adaptable. All of our blood ca ncers keep changing, that's how they resist treatmen t; no matter what, they're conti nually evolving. The genetic component is very complicated to start with and it get s worse over time, and the disease recu rs. But the immune system is honestly very poten t and adaptable, so it can adapt. You get a cold today, you get better. You get an earache next week, you get better. Maybe, just maybe , the immune system can outsmart blood cancers. Ms. Landro : As a patient, I always had the advantage of bei ng a journalist and being able to get information and having friends who were scientists. Ms. Ruddy, I think you were probably pretty sharp about all the information you had to get. We have that na tural instinct to dig, and we have connections. I'm curious on your thoughts about this as someone who has been your o wn advocate, you've advocated for others, y ou've written about this. What ca n scientists do to make it easier for patients to advocate for themse lves, to keep up with all these things and to know what they should be asking about? I'm not sure that m ost cancer patients ever he ar of some of these things or that there are clinical trials avail able. What would you advocate fo r in that case? Ms. Zammett Ruddy : When I was diagnosed, it was November. I was working at Glamour Magazine at the time. The December issue had a story in i t with an image of two hands with a pile of orange pills. The headline was \"These Wo men Knew They Were Dying; Then a New Drug Saved Their Lives.\" The magazine I was worki ng at had just run a story abou t Brian Druker and the original Gleevec trials. I just got the ch ills. It was so crazy. I came back and Glamour Magazine helped me. I got on a plane the next day to O regon. So yes, I was very luc ky. I still hear from people all the time that were diagnosed and they rea ch out to me a lot through soci al media. 25 But I think tha t what still is so crazy to me is that people go to the doctor that treat ed their mother's breast cancer to treat them for CML . I say \"No. Go to a special ist for your kind o f cancer!\" There are so many great advocacy groups on Facebook and soc ial media, and that's a great p lace for them. I know a lot of doctors now do ge t out there and talk about these things. I'm in a treatment-free remission group. It has people from all over the world and ther e is some really i nteresting sharing going on. I think that's what's so great and I always tell peop le to do that. It sounds like you're not going to get the best information on the Internet. That's alway s the first thing y ou tell people, \"Don't go on the Internet. Don't Google your disease when you're diagn osed.\" Ms. Landro : Right. Of course, everybody has to do that now. Ms. Zammett Ruddy : I always guide people to LLS. How many times have I called the people at LLS to say \"I have a friend who was diagnosed. She lives in San Francisco.\" Connecting them. We are curing more people. We are getting people to that next step , so talking about it right upfront\u2014I remember being in the doctor's office, my mom asking about kids . I was so embarrassed that she brought it up but here I am 14 year s later with three kids. I t hink it's presenting the whole picture and talking to patients not just about curing the cancer but al so about the whole life and what could come next. Ms. Landro : Exactly, the collateral damage that Dr. Love talked about, for a young woman diagnosed with a blood cancer and facing a transplant or massiv e doses of chemot herapy. I lost my fertility. It's no secret. At t he time they were just beginn ing to offer IVF. Now they can offer to save ovaries. I think there's more of tha t collateral damage th at people are thin king about. Let's think about that life afterwards. Dr. Love : I would ask that as we've got a ll these new exc iting approaches and new exciting drugs that we really do collect true patient-reported outcomes, not j ust the side effect s we think are going to happen, so that we can also do precision medicine on the col lateral damage. I'm sure that there are single-nucleotide polymorphism s (SNPs) or something that wi ll predict who is going to get peripheral neuropathy. We really haven't put much science into looking at tha t because not enough people have lived long enough. But now that we're having all th ese successes, we really have to pay attention to that as well. Dr. Ybarra : Expanding clinical trial opportuni ties is key because right now too few people think about and enroll in clinical trials. T hat may be a part of the settin g where you're getti ng your care but there are a number of clinical trials t hat do happen in the community . So that is an opportunity. And, to Dr. Love's point on patient-report ed outcomes, t hat's definitel y something that the industry is very interested in integrating earlie r in the clinical trial process . On the back end, where we are worried about value and deliverin g high value care, making sure patients are getting the right val ue; making sure that we're me asuring that, and we have quality measures that reflect value tha t actually matters to patients. It is really interesting to think about when I ask my patients, what do you want to get out of today's visit? It is a different setting in the emergency department, of cour se, but it's always eye-openin g to see what it is people are looking for. Dr. Love : It's never what you think. Dr. Ybarra : It's never what you thin k. Absolutely right. 26 [Addressed to Dr. Conti by audience member: Wh at should be done about oral parity when it comes to the cost of medications?] Dr. Conti : It's clear that patients are fa cing very high copayments attach ed to oral cancer drugs, including those that are treating multiple myeloma and other bl ood cancers. A number of states have passed oral parity legislat ion to try to reduce the costs that patients are facing out of pocket. However, there's some perversit y attached to that. Some of the states did not pass legislation that made sure that insurers didn't rai se the prices that patients f ace for both oral dr ugs and the infused drugs. Some states had the fore thought to actually craft legisl ation that did that. Unfortunately, right now for many of the drugs that a re treating blood cancers, the states are very uneven in what they guarantee in terms of affordab ility to their patients. Dr. DeGennaro : This is an area that LLS is ve ry concerned about and very activ e in. We've been very active in the states that have passed the proper legislati on making sure, in coalition with other organizations, the right tenets ar e being brought into the legi slation at the right time. We've heard a lot about the development of new oral therapies. In an intere sting way, we're getting to the point where someday the pharmacist w ill be the frontline of cancer ca re as we advance those oral therapies. It really speaks to getti ng the legislation right an d building the business model correctly so that patients have access to those drugs. Dr. Conti : I agree, and it's entir ely possible that pharmacists are actual ly on the frontlines of thinking about this financial toxicity i ssue and what to do about it. Th inking creatively about how we can actually use that point of care to assess which patients are ac tually having difficulty and what resources are out there is an important part of the solution. [Addressed to Dr. DeGennaro and Dr. Byrd by audience member: Is there something that's come back from the FDA indicating that, as y ou test precision medicine therapies for AML, that they would consider an approval after a phase II trial with 10 or 20 patients? To Dr. DeGennaro: What, if anythi ng, is LLS doing to try to speed that regulatory process, and what are we doing to support precision medicine for AML?] Dr. Byrd : The FDA, in the talks that I'v e had with them, has said that th ey want to move good drugs forward to approval as quickly as possible. The reason I think\u2014 and this is my opinion\u2014that a lot of drugs have failed in AML is bec ause they have very modest benef it and a lot of toxicity. The FDA has shown in a lot of other dis eases when you have drugs that a re very targeted, where you don't need a statistician to tell that i t's a very active drug and it beats the pants off of e verything else, the FDA does want to move those forwar d. It's not just in AML. I be lieve it's in all cancers, blood and solid tumor. Dr. DeGennaro : LLS has been at the forefront of p recision medicine since the m id-1990s. Someone mentioned Gleevec being the firs t among precision medicine appr oaches. The development of that drug changed the paradigm of how physicians and scientists thin k about treating cancer. Suddenly you could use a drug to attack the cancer and leave the good ce lls of the body alone. That's precision medicine. We've been at the forefron t of that, and it 's actually heartwarming to know that today, we're beginning to apply t hose same tenets to many other blood cancers and, as was just mentioned by Dr. Byrd, to many o ther forms of cancer as well. With respect to the FDA, the role that we're playing is as educ ator. We can't influence the FDA nor should we, but we can provide, a s a third-party, neutral, credi ble, up to date information about the state-of-the-art medicine and sci ence in the blood cancers. And frankly, the unme t medical need that patients face. What are the pati ent issues? The FDA, I'm very p leased to say, has been very open to 27 meeting with us, gaining that understanding from us, and, in fa ct, even meeting wi th patients through us as well, to hear directly fr om patients about what their exp ectations are. [Addressed to the panel by audience member: I'm a survivor of NHL with lymphoma. I was on two vaccine trials and failed in the early 2000s but I am still alive thanks to rituxan. At the table today is every representative except the fe deral government. In the team approach, what can each player here do to increase the coh esive effort to promote clinical trials? With only five or ten percent of trials (filled), there' s got to be a way to incentivize trials, maybe a government contribution, tax benefits, pharm a contribution, academic contribution.] Dr. Love : As a former practicing physici an, I think it's the physicians t hat are the barrier more than the patients becaus e when you talk to pati ents they're often ve ry happy to participate, in my experience. It's the physicians that don't want to bother, that it's easier to just do things the way they've always done it. Or they'r e afraid they'll have to lose the patient to another center that's doing the trial whereas they could k eep doing the same thing. This is certainly true in breast cancer, and I would bet it's also probably tr ue in the blood c ancers as well. We've focused a lo t on educating the public, and they're pretty far al ong. But we haven't done as mu ch in educating and figuring out ways to incentivize or to somehow ge t the physicians into the pool. Dr. Byrd : I think it comes back to what we were talking about, costs in v alue-based care. You're looking at the numer ator to denominator of all patients. If you look at patients that are cared for at comprehensive cancer c enters down to people in private practice , the frequency of patients going on clinical trials goes down and t he outcome\u2014survival\u2014of patients, as measured by the gold standard, goes down. There's been published work on t hat and the complexi ties are many. For the doctor that's in private practice, i t takes a lot of time to put someb ody on a clinical tri al, to counsel them, to fill out the toxicity forms, to s ee them for their extra visits , to meet with the monitors. And in our clinical trial system there' s not enough funding for that. Agai n, I'll come back to LLS. They support clinical scholars t hat pay people that wan t to be focused on pu tting patients on clinic al trials. It's part of their salary to facilitate t heir ability to do that. The doc tors have to feed their fa milies as well, so it's a very complicated issue both ways. Ms. Landro : Certainly, I will say that looking at clinicaltrials.gov, years ago you could never find out about a clinical trial on your o wn. You can go online now and a ctually do some really sophisticated searches. Now, I know not all pat ients are doing that but if th ey could find a way to get that word out there a little more I think tha t would give people a little mor e self-advocacy. Dr. Levine : I'll just put in one plug again for LLS that maybe we haven't t alked about, and it's something that you asked earlier , about how to navigate the sys tem. One aspect that LLS is probably at the vanguard of in cancer medicine is that they hav e people who sit at telephone banks whose job is to actually help pat ients find trials and doctors. There are very few ot her cancer specific foundations who, on a free basis , have people sitting waiting t o help you go through that process. I think one thing we need to do as doctors and patients and fou ndations and pharma is get that message out there. There actually is an incredibly ro bust infrastructure that LLS has been providing for a long time that is being utilized by many but c ould be utilized by many more. I think that patient s need to understand that they have many options. They have many people who actually are experts at navigating the system, who are waiting to hel p them. I think the more we can d o to get the word out about that aspect the more the system benefits. 28 Ms. Zammett Ruddy : For what the patients can do, I th ink that joining clinical tri als when you can is important. I know that a trial al ways sounds like it's your las t chance, and it's not like that. There are so many trials out there that are not just because everything e lse has failed. In my experience, I was ready to join this trial a year ago. This is a trial where you just stop taking your drug. It's very simple. In order to get tha t through at Memorial Sloan Kettering, it to ok a really long time. I could have gone off my drug with just Dr. Mauro ; I didn't have to do it through a trial setting. But i t was important to Dr. Mauro and it was importan t to me as an advocate, and so I d id it. There's more visits. There's ridiculous surveys that were def initely not created by patients . \"Can you run ten miles without difficulty?\" I'm not sur e how that's important. But I do think it's important to spread the word about trials a nd to join them when you can. They're not scary. I was in a trial for the first 18 months. I loved th at extra care and having people ask me questions constantly and wanting to know a ll of that. Now, I do n't want to answer those questions as much as in the beginning, but I think just talking about it as much as you c an is helpful. Dr. Love : One of the things we've done in breast cancer is we have an Arm y of Women (AOW) through my foundation. It's abou t 400,000 people wi th and witho ut a breast cancer diagnosis, who have signed up to get e-mails about studies. Researchers come t o us with their studies. We charge them our cost. Our scientific adv isory committee reviews the st udy and if it is appropriate we send a summary of the study out to eve ryone in the AOW. We don't mat ch anybody, but send it out to everybody because sometimes the study is in Oregon and you're s ending it out to somebody in Florida but their sister lives in Oregon or their friend. Every time we send out the st udies they virally get sent out further. We've been ve ry successful at recruiting for a lot of research and also letting the public know what research i s being done. By sending the e-m ails out to everybody, everybody hears about the different studies that are going on and realize s that things are happening. There are ways you can increase the knowl edge out there and have people b e more inclined to participate in studies. [Addressed to the panel by audience member: My question goes back to the access issue. I live in one of the 11 states that haven't pas sed parity legislation, Pennsylvania. How would you bridge the gaps between legislators who want to attack cost from the bigger perspective and patients who need access to treatment? A nd with generic or biosimilar versions now starting to be approved, is that going to play a role in how this moves forward?] Dr. Ybarra : Medicines are unique because t hey do go generic. You have a med icine on the market that's transformative, and after a certain period of time it's going to go generic. There is always that market change. I want to make sure eve ryone knows we do work collaboratively o n a policy level, and we're trying to do more. Particularly in this ti me of intense change, where the system has changed fundamentally in the last five years and we've had an incredi ble change in the s cience, our advocacy effort is to really make sure that patients have a ccess. And it's not just legislat ors, it's also advocating and working with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) to take a hard look at some of these formularies and make sure that patients have reasonable out of pocket costs and that there aren't formulary design issues formula ries that create barriers to acc ess, not just for canc er but even for a disease like HIV. There's obviously more work to be done on the advocacy front. I t's something we're working on to the extent possible, we are ta lking about this value driven hea lthcare system. And that is going to mean having conversations wit h payers moving forward. 29 Key Points of Consensus Consensus emerged from the divers e group of panelists around th e collaboration that is occurring across the ecosystem between sci entists, academics, pharmaceuti cal companies, regulators and advocacy groups. Panelists also fo cused on the big role precisi on medicine has played and will continue to play on the devel opment of cancer treatments. Overa ll, the panelists recommended that the following actions be ta ken to advance blood cancer res earch, treatment and advocacy: Collaboration must continue ac ross the board in order to advan ce the development of treatment and suppo rt patient care. A focus on precision medicine w ill continue to positively impa ct the development of cancer treatments. There needs to be a continued focu s on the issue of patient ac cess and affordability. Enabling patients to assist in generating patient reported out comes will help with overall patient care during and following treatment in order to improve quality of life. Venture philanthropy will cont inue to be an important part of the drug development ecosystem. # # # "}
