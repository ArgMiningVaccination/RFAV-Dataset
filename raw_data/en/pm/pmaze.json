Call the First Impressions Welcome Team at 1-833-848-8729 , TTY: 711 , Monday to Friday, 8 a.m. to 9 p.m. ET, except holidays. What is a deductible? When applicable, a deductible is the amount of money you pay for health care services before your plan starts paying. After you reach your deductible, you will still have to pay toward your cost share for services . Certain plans have no deductible and will cover your health care services from the start . Other services will be covered by your plan before you reach the deductible. For more details, please see the Benefits Charts included in this guide. What is a copay? When applicable, a copay is a fixed dollar amount that you pay for covered services . A copay is often charged to you after your appointment . What is coinsurance? When applicable, coinsurance is the percentage of a covered health care cost that you would pay after you meet your deductible, while the plan pays the rest of the covered cost . If you have not yet met your deductible, you pay the full allowed amount. What is a primary care provider (PCP)? A primary care provider (PCP) is a general practice doctor who treats basic medical conditions . Primary care doctors do physicals or checkups and give vaccinations . They can help diagnose health problems and either provide care or refer patients to specialists if the condition requires. They are often the first doctor most patients see when they have a health concern . What is an annual out-of-pocket maximum (or Max OOP)? One feature of Medicare Advantage is the Max OOP . It is the maximum total amount you may pay every plan year for your covered health care costs, including copays, coinsurance and deductibles. Once you reach the Max OOP, you pay nothing for your covered health care costs until the start of the next plan year . Not all medical costs are included or subject to the annual out-of-pocket maximum . To learn more details and what services are covered by this plan, please see the Benefits Charts included in this guide. How is inpatient care different from outpatient care? Inpatient care is medical treatment that is provided when you have been formally admitted to the hospital or other facility with a doctor's order . If you are not admitted with a doctor's order, you may be considered an outpatient, even if you stay in the hospital overnight . Outpatient care is any health care services provided to a patient who is not admitted to a facility . Outpatient care may be provided in a doctor's office, clinic, or hospital outpatient department . What are preventive care and services? Preventive care and services help you avoid an illness or injury . Common examples of preventive care are immunizations and an annual wellness visit . Any screening test done in order to catch a disease early is considered a preventive service . Advice or counseling, such as nutrition and exercise guidance, is also an example of preventive care and services .
