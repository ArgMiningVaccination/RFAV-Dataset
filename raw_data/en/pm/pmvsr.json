Topical Collection Mind-Body Approaches that are Revolutionizing the Health Field Editor Peta Stapleton, PhD Associate Professor, Faculty of Society and Design, Bond University, Australia [Website](https://research.bond.edu.au/en/persons/peta-stapleton) | [E-Mail] Research Interests: complementary and alternative medicine/integrative medicine; energy psychology; health psychology; eating disorders; obesity Topical Collection Information There is mounting evidence for the role of the mind in disease and healing and recent years have seen a greater acceptance of mind-body medicine. These approaches are commonly used to treat a variety of chronic health conditions, including depression and anxiety, and offer a potentially more accessible and acceptable alternative to conventional mental health treatment for disadvantaged individuals, who may not otherwise receive mental health treatment. These approaches are a diverse group of health care practices focused on the relationships among the mind, body, brain, and behavior that are not currently considered a part of conventional medicine. The National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health lists the following as mind-body practices: acupuncture, massage, meditation (including mindfulness meditation), movement therapies, relaxation (breathing exercises, guided imagery, and progressive muscle relaxation), spinal manipulation, t'ai chi or qigong, yoga, healing touch, and hypnotherapy (www.nccam.nih.gov). Mind-body approaches are among the most commonly used complementary health approaches, and they continue to increase in popularity. This special edition examines evidence for the efficacy of these interventions that are revolutionising the health and medical field: specifically mind-body approaches for several mental and physical health symptoms, functioning, self-care, and overall quality of life.
