Bacteria can be found virtually everywhere in the environment. These single celled organisms have been isolated from the highest mountains and the deepest depths of the sea, at all ranges of temperatures and pH. Many of the trillion types of bacteria are helpful. They are instrumental in the cycling of nutrients in soils and help to maintain a steady balance in the ecosystem both on land and in water. They play important roles in human health as well, assisting with the digestive process, production of certain nutrients in the intestinal tract and in helping the immune system to fight off pathogenic organisms. Pathogenic bacteria, however, are responsible for a multitude of disease conditions. These organisms infect a number of organs and systems in the body, for example: Campylobacter, Salmonella and Escherichia coli affect mainly the gastrointestinal tract and are most commonly associated with food poisoning. Streptococcus bacteria affect the mouth, nose, throat and upper respiratory tract. Lyme disease is caused by the spirochete bacteria Borrelia burgdorferi and affects mainly the skin and musculoskeletal system. Cholera, tuberculosis, typhoid fever, bacterial pneumonia, tetanus, otitis media and cystitis are additional examples of bacterial infection. While antibiotics are sometimes necessary, homeopathic treatment for bacterial infections holds many advantages over conventional treatment with antibiotics: 1) Does not promote the evolution of resistant stains 2) No immuno-suppression caused by the destruction of beneficial gut microflora 3) Supports the body's natural ability to resolve bacterial infections Bacteria-Tox is a powerful homeopathic detoxifier homaccord specifically designed to assist in the resolution of bacterial infections.
