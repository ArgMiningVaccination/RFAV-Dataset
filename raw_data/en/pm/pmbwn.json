{"title": "COVID-19 Vaccination Information Reminder for TCM Practitioners and Acupuncturists", "author": null, "url": null, "hostname": null, "description": null, "sitename": null, "date": "2021-09-23", "cleaned_text": "In recent weeks, the College has received a number of inquiries regarding COVID-19 and vaccinations. We continue to monitor the government's COVID-19 guidance and will provide updates as required. The College expects our members to comply with the recommendations and directives from the health authorities regarding practices during COVID-19. The College recognizes that we continue to operate in a unique and challenging environment. We thank our members for their continued commitment to the delivery of safe, ethical and competent care to the people of Ontario, and to protect one another by stopping the spread of COVID-19. As a reminder: - Vaccination is outside of the TCM scope of practice [1](#footnote1). As such, practitioners should not be advising patients about vaccinations. For example, if a practitioner is asked about the efficacy of the COVID-19 vaccines or other vaccinations, they must tell the patient that they cannot provide this information and advise the patient to speak to a regulated health professional whose scope of practice allows them to provide the information (e.g., family physicians, nurses, etc.). - Information that a practitioner provides in their professional capacity must be factual, accurate, easily verified, independent of personal opinion, and within their scope of practice. - Practitioners should not use their position as regulated health care providers to share their personal opinions with patients. For example, it is expected that in their professional capacity, practitioners not express or promote anti-vaccination sentiments or misinformation that contradicts evidence-based public health advice. It may be difficult for patients and the public to discern when the practitioner is representing themselves as a regulated health professional or not. Improper or ill-informed guidance may confuse patients and, in the interest of protecting the public, may be deemed unprofessional conduct. - When using social media, practitioners are advised to follow the same rules that would apply to any other forms of communication, that is, by maintaining professional boundaries and communicating respectfully, accurately, and professionally. Publicly communicating or making statements contrary to the information provided by public health authorities (e.g., promoting anti-vaccination sentiments, anti-masking, anti-lockdown and/or promoting unproven therapies for treating or preventing COVID-19) are inappropriate, potentially harmful, and could result in an investigation by the CTCMPAO and/or disciplinary action, where warranted. - Members are reminded that even when they are communicating on a personal or closed social media account, their comments and opinions may still be viewed as that of a regulated health professional. - It is expected that as regulated health care providers, members follow the directives and guidance from the Ministry of Health and Public Health Ontario on issues related to COVID-19, immunization and public health in general. Members who are found to be practising contrary to College expectations and public health directives may face consequences, such as a College investigation that may result in a referral to the discipline committee. - Performing a procedure on tissue below the dermis and below the surface of a mucous membrane for the purpose of performing acupuncture. - Communicating a traditional Chinese medicine diagnosis identifying a body system disorder as the cause of a person's symptoms using traditional Chinese medicine techniques.
