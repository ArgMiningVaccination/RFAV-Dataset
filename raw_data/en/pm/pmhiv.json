From concentrating on genetic traits and immunology to nutrition and meat quality to health and welfare of poultry, our scientists provide vital research for the nation and world.", "sitename": "Department of Animal Science", "date": "2023-03-29", "cleaned_text": "The focus of the Lamont lab is to elucidate the genetic and genomic architecture controlling complex biological traits, especially those related to fitness and resistance to disease, by applying contemporary technologies to the study of unique populations of chickens. Her research focuses on molecular genetics of poultry immunology, disease resistance, skeletal composition, body composition, and meat quality. The Bobeck lab's work focuses on the interaction of nutrition and the immune system. We use cell culture, ex vivo cells and tissues, and whole animal studies in poultry and mice to answer questions related to bioactive components of feedstuffs. Dr. Bobeck's projects range from basic digestibility work to immunometabolism, and we continually work to mechanistically link immune system changes to performance, health, welfare, and sustainability within the poultry industry. She additionally collaborates with Dr. Anna Johnson's lab to promote welfare, sustainability, and productivity in meat birds. The Ahn lab research focus is 1) how to improve or maintain the quality and safety of poultry meat products and 2) separation of functional components from egg yolk and white and add values to the egg components. Dr. Johnson's poultry research involves collaborating with Dr. Bobeck's lab to focus on broiler chicken well-being through studying novel environmental enrichment methods and validating animal-based behavior and welfare measurements. The aims of projects are to implement enrichment that can increase broiler feed efficiency to decrease feed inputs and maximize production, thereby increasing sustainability, while enhancing the environment of meat-type chickens in order to to promote physical activity and overall animal well-being. Dr. Richard S. Gates serves as the Director of the Egg Industry Center. He holds the Iowa Egg Council Endowed Professorship and has appointments in the departments of agricultural and biological engineering and animal science at Iowa State University. His research focuses on controlled environment systems in agriculture, with an emphasis on biological and physiological responses and interactions between animals and the environment. He also has studied animal welfare, precision livestock farming and post-harvest loss measurements. His extension work focuses on the application of research to air emissions and their mitigation, odor and siting issues, livestock environmental control systems, and livestock heat stress reduction. Dr. Maro's lab focuses on economics of the egg industry, egg cost of production and prices and projections of egg production and prices. he provides meaningful marketing and statistical information to the industry in the form monthly reports including flock and price projections. Dr. Dawn Koltes focuses her research efforts on understanding the underlying effects of environment and genetics on intestinal health, nutrient absorption, and overall energy utilization in broilers, layers, and turkeys. Her current research focuses on factors that impact intestinal tract permeability, intestinal microbial communities and their interaction; how intestinal tract permeability and microbes differ between different housing types in layers; effects of selection pressure for meat or egg production on the intestinal tract; and effects of feed ingredients on performance, intestinal tract permeability, and intestinal microbial communities in broilers, layers, and turkeys. Dr. Dekkers focuses on genetics of disease (New Castle Disease) and use of genomics in poultry breeding programs. "}
