The most important element of this change has been to align responsibility with authority at the divisional level, mimicking the relationship of Dean to Chair, at the departmental level between Chair and Chief. The Department has now gone through an ex tensive financial reporting redesign, engaging and achieving buy -in at all levels of the institution, which has dramatically reduced the complexity of the financial analyses and reporting for the Department and Divisions, separating operating activities fr om programmatic activities. These financial philosophies are a direct result of some of our improved clinical and research metrics. The Department has continued to improve our patient care documentation. In addition to improving care, our department wo rk RVU per c linical FTE increased 4% over the prior year which is a reflection of the improved documentation. Our research and contract total awards have consistently topped $30 million for the last 4 years (includes extramural awards received by DoIM Faculty in the UNM Cancer Center, UNM Center for Infectious Diseases, and Department faculty located at Albuquerque VA Medical Center). Faculty salaries on extramural sources grew 27% from the prior year, without institu tional -wide salary increases. The Department c ontinues to cafefully manage its resources , and a chieved a positive operating margin in FY 2010 . Clinical & Translational Science Center \u2014Accelerating HSC Research The UNM Clinical and Translational Science Center (CTSC) was funded on July 1, 2010, achieving the institution's goal of becoming one of the 60 Academic Science Centers in the country to achieve such a designation. This prestigious center is designed to transform the institution by serving as an effective academic home for clini cal and translational science, by training the next generation of clinical and translational investigators, and by improving the health of New Mexicans through ground -breaking multidisciplinary research. Several Department of Medicine faculty members played key leadership roles in the attainment of this award, as summarized below: - Pope Moseley, MD, as co -Director of the Clinical Research Unit (CRU) and Leader of its Regional Collaborative Network (RCN), - Mark Burge, MD, as deputy Director of the Cen ter, - David Schade, MD, as Director of the Core laboratory, - Mark Schuyler, MD, as Instructor for the Masters Degree in Clinical Research, - Akshay Sood, MD, as an accomplished Mentored Career Development Scholar. Congratulations to this team for a mo mentous achievement! 2 Robert Hromas, M.D., P rofessor and Division Chief of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Deputy D irector, Clinical Affairs and Translational Research at UNM Ca ncer Center, has been awarded NIH ARRA grant for Trans poase Metrase in Leukemic Decatenation. The funding will assist in hiring a post -doc fellow to further enhance research in the decatenation ability of Metnase that is down regulated by auto -methylation. This grant will provide funding for a previous study from NIH that had been cut from the original five years to four. An additional year will enhance research capabilities in finding better methods for treatment of bladder and lung cancer. Robert Hromas, M.D. Professor and Divison Chief of Hemtalogy/Oncolo gy, Department of Internal Medicine has been awarded NIH ARRA grant for FY 2009 -10 for Transposase Protein Metnase in Etoposide Resistance in the amount of $311,249.00 . Robert Hromas, M.D. Professor and Divison Chief of Hemtalogy/Oncology, Department of Inter nal Medicine has been awarded NIH ARRA continuation grant for FY 2009 -10 for Transposase protein Metnase in Etoposide Resistance in the amount ot $305,925.00. Robert Hromas, M.D. Professor and Divison Chief of Hemtalogy/Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine has been awarded NIH ARRA supplement grant funding for Transposase Protein Metnace in Leukemic in the Professor and Divison & Preventive Medicine in the Depa rtment of Internal Medicine h as been awarded NIH ARRA Administrative Supplement grant funding for FY 2009 -10 for Solar Exposure and Melanoma Survival in the amount of $147,045.00. Claire Verschraegen, M.D., P rofessor, De partment of Internal Medicine in the Division of Hematology/Oncology, D irector, Translational Therapeutics, Cancer Research and Treatment Center, has been awarded supplemental ARRA funding. The title of the grant is New Mexico - Based Community Clinical Oncology Program. Focus of the supp lemental grant is to hire a researcher who will delve into the role of physicians in recruiting minority patients to cancer clinical trials (CCTs). One of the underlying factors is that the State of New Mexico citizens (1.9 million) that are composed of 4 2% Hispanic and 10% Native American, with 50% of all citizens living in rural areas have disproportionate cancer health disparities. The New Mexico Minority -Based Community Oncology Program (NM MBCCOP) purpose is to build community capacity for clinical re search through cancer education and outreach programs and to overcome significant socioeconomic and cultural barriers to increase access and accrual to NCI sponsored cancer treatment and prevention clinical trials. The research intervention will have the f ollowing aims: 1) to understand the barriers to patients referral to CCTs by physicians from the physicians perspective; 2) to examine the relationship between physicians' perception of referral to patients to CCTs and their actual referral rate; 3) to und erstand the barriers to patients' referrals to CCTs by physicians from the patients' perspective and; 4) to design and pilot -test an intervention that 3 would increase referral of patients, including minority patients, to CCTs by physicians. This will be a 3 year study. Thomas Ma, M.D., Ph.D., Professor and Divison Chief, Gastroenterology & Hepatology in the Department of Internal Medicine has been awarded NIH ARRA grant funding for FY2009 -10 for Autophagy and Crohn's Disease in the amount of $103,315.00.

The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) has announced the award of a three -year grant to Project ECHO (Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes), a New Mexico program that uses evidence -based medicine and interactive technology to bring sorely ne eded specialty care to patients living in rural and underserved areas who are suffering from serious, complex chronic conditions. The RWJF grant is supporting a replication of the ECHO model, beginning with the University of Washington in Seattle, and the expansion of the model to treat other common chronic and complex diseases, including diabetes, substance abuse and mental health problems, asthma, rheumatology, chronic pain, and high -risk pregnancy. Akshay Sood, CTSC Scholar and associate professor, Divi sion of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, has received a funding for a NIH K23 grant. The grant funding is for Obesity -related Host Susceptibility for Asthma in Women. Dr. Sood is a clinically trained pulmonologist who is embarking on a career in tra nslational research and affiliated with UNM HSC CTSC Office. The exploratory K23 grant research area is considered a high priority by NIH. It is envisioned that the study may help define the mechanistic basis for the relationship between obesity and asthma , which will significantly assist in developing treatments and preventing this disease. The First Annual Research Day Awards Ceremony was held September 18 , 2009 . Claire F. Verschragen, M.D., Professor, Department of Internal Medicine in the Divison of 4 Hematology/Oncology, D irector, Translational Therapeutics, Cancer Research and Treatment Center was recognized for her Excellence in Clinical Research .

The U.S. United States Distance Learning Association (USDLA) recently presented its 2010 International \" 21st Century Award for Best Practices in Distance Learning\" award to the University of New Mexico's Project Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes (Project ECHO) for its innovative healthcare program that helps provide care of chronic and complex diseases in rural and medically underserved areas of New Mexico. Dr. Dennis Villareal has accepted the Department of Health and Human Services invitation to serve as a member of the Clinical and integrative Diabetes and Obesity Study Section, Center for Scientific Review for at 4 year term. Members are selected on the basis of their demonstrated competence and achievement in their scientific discipline as evidenced by the quality of research accomplishments, publications in scientific journals, and other sig nificant scientific activities, achievements and honors. The Department of Internal Medicine had the following faculty member recognized in the Albuquerque Magazine as being the Top Doctors of 2009 -10 in his specialty: George Comeerci, M.D., General Int ernal Medicine. A total of 40 UNM physicians were nominated in their discipline. 5 Hashimoto: Medicine, Music, Making a Difference Distinguished Professor Fred Hashimoto, a saxophone playing 35 -year veteran of the School of Medicine, still gets the call when someone is sick, even though he's semi -retired. He also responds to the calls when it's a social ill that needs addressing. Hashimoto is a general internist Back in the olden days, the general internist was a specialist to aspire to because y ou have to know a lot about everything. I like it, he said. Coming to UNM, he said, I started out as a workhorse, taking care of specialists' patients who needed general care. Hashimoto worked to develop and direct urgent care and primary care programs. About four years ago he became chief of staff, giving him the opportunity to lead and get involved in university -wide issues. Even before that he was actively engaged in Faculty Senate and served on the Corrales City Council. Athletic activism Hash imoto fought first to save the 25 -yard pool in Johnson Center. They thought about taking out the pool and using the space for a floor facility. I told them we needed to keep it in case anything happened to the Olympic pool, he said. I stood outside John son Center in my swimsuit and towel gathering more than 1,100 signatures. Roger Wrolstad [director, Recreational Services], and the others changed their minds. He dove into another issue: fighting elimination of men's swimming, gymnastics and wrestling, all in the name of Title IX, the federal mandate to provide equal opportunity to women in athletics in higher education. He argued that the intent of Title IX is to provide equal opportunity, not equality of numbers. The programs were still cut, but Hashim oto's efforts didn't go unnoticed. Stories appeared in the Chronicle of Higher Education and NCAA News Hashimoto also took on the New Mexico State Legislature when they considered dumbing down entrance requirements for athletes, he said. I went to their meeting - I even put on a suit and tie, and I never do that. I took faculty with me to sit at the hearings. The bill got tabled and died. Healthy habitats Hashimoto took on drinking and driving, working to lower the blood alcohol levels determining inebriation. On campus, he took up the no smoking cause. It just didn't seem right to walk out of the hospital and have to pass through a cloud of cigarette smoke to walk to the cancer center, he said. He said quality of care is his big push. I want t o improve patient satisfaction while also making this a better work place for faculty and staff, he said. He noted that UNM patient satisfaction wasn't ranked highly, so he pushed for it. By recognizing individuals, we can offer incentives to improve, h e said, noting it was something he could do as chief of staff. Back on sax But what about that saxophone? Is that really Hashimoto playing with other musicians at Hanging of the Greens? It is. Hashimoto's mother was a music major who expected all he r children to play an instrument. His first notes were blown on a clarinet, but he quickly moved to sax. I didn't really like the bleeding pig, bullfrog sound of the sax - I wasn't a fan of jazz, blues or swing at the time, he said. He also had to practi ce in the basement in Chicago in winter. So he left his musical aspirations in the basement. About seven years ago, PBS ran a Ken Burns series on jazz. Hashimoto decided to give it another chance. He had to go back to Chicago to 6 move his mother into an ass isted living facility. Down in that basement was his clarinet, warped, and his sax. Once equipped with a new reed, it sounded like the same old bullfrog, he said. Wilmer (Bill) Sibbitt, MD, P rofessor, Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Rheumat ology, has been cited in Nature Reviews/Rheumatology, October 2009, for conducting a study utilizing his RFD (reciprocating procedure device) syringe, which was developed at the HSC and is now marketed and sold through Avanca Medical Devices, a start -up co mpany located in Albuquerque. Sibbitt randomly assigned 148 patients with rheumatoid arthritis or osteoarthritis to receive intra -articular injections guided either by ultrasonography or by palpation. Notably, ultrasonography guided injections were much le ss painful than palpation guided procedures with 60 percent fewer patients in the former group reporting significant procedural pain. This is quite a remarkable finding and has not been previously reported, despite clinical ultrasonography being available for 50 years, said Sibbitt. The study does not address the issue of cost -effectiveness in the routine use of ultrasonographic needle guidance as the investigators themselves acknowledge. Longer outcome studies with extensive cost -benefit analysis are nec essary to determine the long -term benefit of sonographic guidance. Sibbitt's original study is published in the Journal of Rheumatology Does Sonographic Needle Guidance Affect Clinical Outcome of Intraarticular Injections? Sibbitt, et Devo n Neale, and Leonard Noronha have been selected to participate in the Medical Education Scholars (MES) Program at the University of New Mexico from September 2010 through May 2011. Dr. Diane Klep per has been elected as a new 2010 -11 Board Member of the La Tierra Sagrada Society (LTSS) a University of New Mexico School of Medicine program to provide medical students with financial assistanc e, fellowship and volunteerism through membership . Dr. L ee Brown has been elected to the new Board of Trustees for The Greater Albuquerque Medical Association (GAMA) for 2010. Remembering Joseph V. Scaletti, Ph.D., July 22 , 1926 - March 8, 2010 Joseph V. Scaletti, Ph.D. was a true trailblazer. Know n for hi s integr ity and a soft -spoken, down -to-earth manner , he would immediately put people at ease \u2014a natural gift that served him well. At a Memorial Service on May 8, 2010 on UNM North Campus, Joe was recognized and remembered for his many contributions to t he UNM School of Medicine (SOM) . Dr. Scalett i traded his tenured position at the University of Minnesota for a make -shift l ab in a converted 7 -Up bottling plant to help undertak e the challenge of creating a ne w medical sc hool at UNM as one of our fou nders. He received a federal grant to organize the Allied Health Sciences Program, known as Diagnostic & Therapeutic Medicine. This addressed an urge nt need to train all member of the healthcare team, (e.g., physical therapists, occupational therapists, radiologic technologists, ets.) to better serve rural NM communities. 7 As the 1st Vice President of Research, he established the Ri o Grande Research Corridor, a collaborative partnership linking the major state univers ities and national laboratories. He led the creation of the 163-acre UNM R esearch P ark on the South Campus, now the Scie nce & Technology Park and home to the Center of High Technology Materials. Through his Rural Health Interdisc iplinary Program, he established problem -based learni ng teams who spent two months each summer stud ying and working at rural clinics throughout the state. He chaired a task force that developed the model using advanced technology to support and educate rural healthcare providers \u2014the beginning of telemedicine and distance learning in NM. Dr. Scaletti worked with Dr. Sanjeev Arora securing federal funding f or Pro ject ECHO (Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes). Through the use of technology, ECHO bridges the gap between urban healthcare specialist s and providers in rural settings. Dr. Scaletti was posthumously awarded the UNM School of Medicine's Legacy Award, which honored his innovation and creativtity. Dr. Arti Prasad, Director and founder of the UNM Center for Life , was recently hono red by the Albuquerque Journal with the SAGE 20 Women Making a Difference Award, an award the Albuquerque Journal's SAGE magazine is giving in honor of its 20th anniversary. The award recognizes 20 women whose accomplishments have had the greatest impact i n New Mexico over the past 20 years. The 20 winners were featured on the cover of the November issue of SAGE. Dr. Prasad was selected for the health category. The Paul Bartlett R\u00e9 Peace Prize rec ognizes UNM stu dents, alumni, fac ulty, staff or retiree s who meet that challenge. The 2010 awardee is Arti Prasad , M.D., Section Chief of Intergrative Medicine in the Division of General Internal Medicine and found ing Exec utive D irector of UNM's Cen ter for Life, and Peace Talks Radio, cre ated and pro duced in part by UNM alumni and staff. Paul R\u00e9 is rec ognized inter nationally for pro moting world peace and har mony through his art. At a recent award cer emony, R\u00e9 said peace making has mul tiple dimen sions, inter nal and external peace, con flict res olution and con flict prevention. That bal ance is cen tral to the Cen - ter for Life at the UNM Health Sci ences Cen ter. Inter nal peace trans lates into exter nal peace, Prasad said. The UNM Cen for Life uses inte grative m edicine, incor porating an array of ancient and modern tech niques to treat peo ple with a wide range of health issues. Prasad said inte grative medicine is focused on the har mony of mind, body and spirit. It cre ates more coher ence within the person and within their care. The cen ter pro vides not only a ser vice but a vision. The UNM Cen ter for Life acts as a microcosm of what our future can be, Prasad said. In his vision state ment for the prize, R\u00e9 said, When we thor ough ly inte grate peace into all of our thoughts and actions, our life becomes a work of art. That's a famil iar les son to lis teners of Peace Talks Radio.

SIGNIFICANT DEVELOPMENTS DURING THE ACADEMIC YEAR Graduate Medical Education - The University of New Mexico's Department of Internal Medicine Residency Program had a successful recruiting season and match. Six preliminary positions were filled, all from the University of New Mexico. Four Neurology preliminary positions were filled: one from UNM, one from a US school, one from India and one from Grenada. Twenty categorical positions (10 from US schools a nd 10 International) were filled. The wide diversity of schools represented includes the Mid -West (U Illinois), the Southeast (UT Houston, UT Galveston, U North TX Osteopathic); the East (Drexel U), the West (U Nevada, U Colorado, Touro U Osteopathic, Western U Osteopathic). International medical schools represented are in Australia, Dubai, Ecuador, India, Israel, Jordan, and Pakistan. The wide range of medical schools that supply residents to us continues to enrich the diversity of our program. - Of the 2009 -10 graduating class, 5 are slated to practice general internal medicine or as hospitalists (3 in New Mexico), 2 are our own Chief Medical Residents, 1 is our Primary Care Chief Resident, and 12 will pursue subspecialty training in various medical subspecialties, 6 at UNM. Of the chief residents, 2 will practice as hospitalists and 1 will pursue subspecialty training. The subspecialty programs chosen by our departing residents include Critical Care (UNM, Scott & White Hospital in Texas), Endocrinol ogy (UNM and U Florida), 40 Gastroenterology UT Southwestern, Ochsner, and Vanderbilt). - Our graduates have a cumulative pass rate of 77% for the ABIM certifying exam for 20 07 through 2009 . - Awards were presented at the annual Spring Awards Banquet to the following residents and faculty. All recipients were chosen by ballot by the residents. Intern of the Year Patrick Rendon, MD Resident of the Year (3 -way tie) Frank Courmier, MD Scott Helberg, MD Rishi Menon, MD Laurent T. Visconti Teaching Fellow of the Year Shaddi Battah, MD William R. Hardy Teaching Physician of the Year J. Rush Pierce, MD - The House Officer Research Award for 2009 -10 was presented to Ihab Alomari, MD. - International electives, both clinical and research rotations, were provided for five residents in Saipan, Kenya, Pakistan, and India. - An annual survey of all residents was again conducted. The information gathered will be used to improve the program. Of particular concern are computer availability at UH, quality of call rooms at the VA, and availability of Chief residents. - Duty hour entry program was changed to www .tsheets.com with the housestaff text - messaging their duty hours or entering them via web browser. Duty hour entry compliance is excellent. The software also allows us to do real time monitoring of duty hours. - The Office of Education continues to track compliance on a daily basis and follow up on the causes of any suspected violations. Weekly duty hour reports are being sent to the GME office, head hospitalists, involved faculty, and Dr. Moseley for review. - With the assistance of the faculty at both institutions, 30 hour violations have been dramatically reduced, so much so that only extreme patient care situations have resulted in 30 hour violations of only a few minutes. There have been no 80 hour violations since adopting our new duty hour policy. - Wards at UNMH changes based on resident feedback: 1) a second as -needed non -resident service operates October to March to assist with the busy winter season. 2) The morning overflow has been taken by the non -resident service(s). - Wards at VA changes to meet RRC requirements: the team cap was decreased to 20 - Cardiology at UNM changes based on resident feedback: 41 1) team rounds on the post call resident's patients first, then that resident is excused to complete his/her work to meet duty ho ur requirements. - Cardiology at VA changes based on resident feedback: 1) call was taken by interns or residents in a q4/5 frequency 2) critical care admissions after 7pm were covered by the VA -MICU team. - Thursday School continues to be a success in t erms of gathering 60% of the residents for committed didactic time free from clinical duties. - A weekly board review conference was conducted for the third year residents to assist in their board preparation April to July. This conference was proctored b y the Program Director, the Associate Program Directors and many of the subspecialty fellows. - Journal Club has successfully been altered to a small group format in which there is a resident discussion leader and a faculty mentor present in each small gro up. - The House Officer Scholarly Activity Committee continued to be successful under the direction of chair Michelle Harkins, MD. Potential mentors and research projects were identified. Assistance was provided to residents in connecting with a suitabl e mentor for their interests. - House officers continued to be productive in their research and scholarly activities. - Resident Portfolios have been created which are maintained in the Office of Education and provide a road map of the resident's resid ency experience. - Evaluations of residents by faculty have been closely monitored and the completion rate has improved to greater than 97% - To gain more resident input into the quality of the residency program, the Resident Voice group was created in w hich residents and the program director could discuss issues related to the residency. - The program and the hospitalists created an Internal Medicine Wards Council which formally reviews changes to the policies and procedures involved with inpatient ward s medicine at UNM; this has successfully improved communication and truncated decision making for an important service for our program. - The program conducted the first faculty annual evaluation of the residency program. The survey revealed that faculty would like more feedback on their teaching. As a result of the survey, when positive or negative feedback on resident evaluation of faculty is received by the Office of Education, that feedback is sent to the faculty member (if anonymity of the resident can be preserved). Additionally, summative evaluation reports are sent to Division/Section Chairs when requested. - The program began resident practice based learning and improvement projects in the outpatient clinics. The goal is to teach the residents how to inquire into the quality of their own medical practice and systematically improve upon it.

SIGNIFICANT PLANS AND RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE NEAR FUTURE 1. We anticipat e a successful ACGME site visit August 25, 2010. The accreditation status should be available to us by mid January 2011. 2. The didactic lectures in Thursday School will be augmented to focus on board preparation in the following manner: - Thursday schoo l topics will be based on an internal medicine text which ensures that topics required for the boards are covered. - Thursday school curriculum is on a 12 -18 month cycle to allow all residents to have 2 opportunities to hear each topic before the end of re sidency. - Quizzes based on board review questions are conducted at the beginning of each Thursday school, based on the topics presented that day - Assigned readings from an Internal Medicine text are assigned each week based on the topics presented that d ay. 3. In ongoing efforts to improve the ratio of service to education, the department anticipates the following changes: - Cardiology has a non -resident service at UNMH to take post -cath and CHF patients. - VA Hospital: non -resident medicine service ta kes patients who are no longer of teaching interest but must remain in the hospital. - UNM Wards: a new wards system has successfully decreased work hours and eliminated the risk for 30 hour duty violations. - UNM Wards: a second seasonal non -resident serv ice to start October 2009 through March 2010. - UNM Hematology/Oncology: rotates the resident with two weeks on each service to provide them with a clinical experience in both fields. 4. Recommendations for future changes which will improve the education al experience of the internal medicine housestaff are: - Nocturnal faculty presence in both the ICU and ward experiences will provide more education for the residents as well as supervision - Increasing utilization of non -resident services with a goal of d ecreasing dependence on residents for service. 5. The Office of Education will continue its scrutiny of service obligations at both UNMH and VAMC with the goal of bringing about the most favorable service vs education ratio for residents. 6. The Program Director and Chief Residents will maintain surveillance of on -call facilities at the VA as renovations proceed in order to insure that RRC requirements are met. 7. The website for the residency office will again be upgraded under the direction of the Department webmaster, with input from the residents, in order to provide an optimal recruiting tool for the program. 45 8. Resident evaluation of faculty completion rate will be focu sed upon to ensure that faculty receive feedback on their teaching and role mod eling. These evaluations will be compiled and given to Division Chairs when requested. 9. The rotation directors will be given a summary report of the rotation evaluations from the residents on an annual basis or when requested so long as anonymity of th e residents can be preserved. 10. The program will review the curriculum to ensure it continues to be a timely, up to date document that guides the education of our residents. 11. To augment our teaching program we will designate one morning report at bo th hospitals ethics morning report, one morning report a month at the VA neurology morning report, and one morning report at UH professionalism morning report.

Staff - Denise Kelly, Medical Residency Coordinator, left the department in January 2010. UNDERGRADUATE MED ICAL EDUCATION 46 FACULTY AND STAFF Bronwyn Wilson, M.D., Professor, Director of Undergraduate Medical Education and Director of Phase III Comprehensive Ambulatory Medicine Ed Fancovic, M.D., Associate Professor and Phase II Clerkship Director Deepti Rao, M.D., Assistant Professor and Associate Clerkship Director Yvonne Dalton -Etheridge, M.D., Assistant Professor and Assistant Phase II Clerkship Director of at VAMC Melissa Cordero, Administrative Assistant III A. SIGNIFICANT DEVELOPMENTS DURING THE ACADEM IC YEAR Phase I: 50 DoIM Faculty were tutors in Phase 1 tutorials 8 DoIM Faculty were preceptors in Foundations of Clinical Practice Dr. Cynthia Arndell (GIM) Piloted the Introduction to Public Health for Medical Students course for the first two week s of medical school as part of the new Public Health Certificate program. Phase II Internal Medicine Clerkship: Curriculum Updates - Post-discharge rounds - a new collaboration with Pharmacy students was piloted and then instituted for the clerkship. Medic al student and pharmacy student teams visit a patient after discharge in the patient's home to review discharge medications and other needs. They then present their findings and give information to the patient's primary care provider. - Phase 2 practical ex am was deleted from the clerkship because of overlap with Assessment and Learning Phase 2 OSCEs. - The clerkship provides a didactic lecture series covering general Internal Medicine topics. These lectures take place every Tuesday afternoon for one hour. - The clerkship offers students direct observation by an expert faculty member as they conduct a typical inpatient encounter. Afterwards, the faculty member provides the student with formative feedback. - Students round with a palliative care and/or medical et hics expert and discuss issues pertaining to death and dying. This is a unique opportunity for students to explore and reflect on end of life care. 47 - Students are expected to maintain a strong commitment to professionalism throughout the clerkship. There is also a process in place to address student concerns about other members of the team if unprofessional activities are observed. Evaluation Updates - The Internal Medicine Clerkship assures that students receive formal feedback in a timely fashion. Currently , the Internal Medicine Clerkship is divided into 2 4 -week inpatient blocks at each of the 2 inpatient sites (University Hospital and the VAMC). The Clerkship director(s) meet with each of the ward teams midway during each of the 4 - week inpatient blocks an d conduct a PRIME evaluation session. The clerkship director(s) then meet individually with each student to discuss the evaluation, and to design a learning plan to improve the student's performance. Thus the students receive mid -block assessment for each 4-week period with the opportunity to build on their competencies as well as to improve their summative evaluations. - The clerkship director reviews the PRIME evaluations for each student at the end of the clerkship and assigns a grade based on a standardiz ed grading scale utilized by all the clerkships. The tutorial leaders grade the students based on a standardized protocol. The shelf board is graded based on a scale that correlates the student's percentage to a numerical grade designation. Final grades a lso include participation in the Post - Discharge Experience. - Phase 2 work hour violations are documented electronically on STROLS by medical students during weeks 2 and 6 of the rotation. The clerkship director promptly reviews any work -hour violations. T he clerkship director subsequently contacts the students and their ward teams directly to see if the violations are the result of the ward teams then these issues are addressed directly with them. If the violations are the result of neglect by the students then this results in a deduction from their professionalism grade. Phase III Students : Curriculum Updates : - Dr. Deepti Rao instituted a new curriculum for the Sub -Interns. She is working with other Sub -Internship Directors at the SOM level to standardiz e objectives for this rotation across disciplines. The curriculum will include Bat Cave interactive simulation teaching experiences including hands on procedural instruction, as well as lectures on common topics and communication issues. - PRIME sessions ha ve been added for the Phase 3 students in order to provide feedback midway through their rotation. - Dr. Wilson continued in role as DoIM Director of the Phase 3 Comprehensive Ambulatory Medicine rotation - The MICU rotation at the VAMC was discontinued due to staffing changes. Advising and Mentoring: - Annual Residency Advisement party for students interested in pursuing internal medicine as a career, hosted by Dr. Chang in June 2010. 48 - Mentoring/advisement sessions are held with students interested in pursuing a career in internal medicine by Clerkship and Residency director(s). - Clerkship director(s) meet with medical students interested in Internal Medicine categorical positions to write Departmental Letters in August 2010. - Dr. Betty Chang will interview medical students interested in Internal Medicine positions and provide career advisement and encourage program selection in October 2010. Career choice of students : Match Year Number of graduating students choosing IM residencies 2006 17 2007 12 2008 11 2009 11 (Data reported by Dr. Eve Espey) - 12 UNM graduating medical students chose to begin their residency training in internal medicine. Four are categorical and eight are preliminary year residents at UNM. Faculty Development initiatives : New Hospita list orientation - The second Hospitalist orientation was held for new faculty members on February 19, 2010. The orientation included an overview of hospital history and organizational structure, clinical and educational expectations, a tour, and computer t raining. - A GroupWise shared folder was created with various types of information ranging from City of Albuquerque Rapid Ride schedules, UNM PopeJoy Hall ticket information, UNM Lobo Card cash deposit handout, and much more. This was then posted on the Hospitalist WIKI site so all faculty could access this information. B. SIGNIFICANT PLANS AND RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE NEAR FUTURE Phase I: - Continue the initiative to better track Educational Teaching Efforts for Phase I - II was implemented ensuring that t he required departmental allocation of 306 weeks of service is met. We continue to work with the data management team at the UME office to make sure we are accurately recording DOIM Faculty teaching efforts. We continue to encourage and monitor participa tion in Tutorials and Foundations of Clinical Practice. 49 Phase II Clerkship : - After review of shelf board performance in different knowledge areas, there will be revision and expansion of the didactic lectures to encompass more ambulatory content and a gr eater diversity of subspecialty topics. The current OSCE skill stations will be revised as well. - Continue to monitor and respond to the impact that Resident Hour restrictions and the new call schedule has on our students. We need to make sure that the st udents have adequate exposure to a variety of Internal Medicine patients. - Dr. Rao is instituting a Best Practices in Teaching on the inpatient wards series for hospitalists. She is collaborating with Dr. Menon in instituting physical exam rounds for the students. - Explore how to integrate an outpatient Internal Medicine experience into the clerkship. - Continue collaboration with other Phase II Clerkship Directors to improve standardization across clerkships. - On-going evaluation of clerkship curriculum and orientation session for Phase II students. - Continue electronic monitoring of numbers and types of patients seen by students, and continue to develop a plan to ensure that all students meet the minimum clerkship expectations. - Continue to identify opportunit ies for direct observation of students, and provide faculty training for this effort. Phase III: - Dr. Rao will continue to monitor and institute changes in the Sub -Internship curriculum. She is also going to investigate how to incorporate BAT CAVE training for procedures into the curriculum. Faculty Development : - New Hospitalist Faculty Nuts & Bolts Lecture Series to include teaching skills development and opportunities, research skills development and opportunities, planning for promotion, and Mentorshi p to start this year. - New Office for Faculty Development and Diversity for the Department to begin on July 1, 2010. Dr. Bronwyn Wilson will be the Vice Chair, and will recruit for a Director of Diversity. She will continue to oversee the Office of Unde rgraduate Medical Education. C.

AWARDS: - There were 19 faculty members serving as Principal Investigators who received 60 awards totaling over $7.6 million ma de for projects submitted through other departments within the School of Medicine, including the Cancer, Research & Treatment Center, the Center for Infectious Disease & Immunity, the Clinical Trials Center, and the New Mexico Tumor Registry. - There were 22 faculty members' servings as Principal Investigators, with appointments in the Department, who applied for federal stimulus package funding through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA). Total funding requested was $19,626,169. To date, 7 of the faculty have received funding totaling $2,031,812. - ARRA funding for 5 DoIM faculty that submitted through the department totaled 6 awards made, for a yearly amount awarded of $782,392. 53 - ARRA funding for 3 faculty members with appointments in the de partment that submitted proposals outside of DoIM received 5 awards made, for a yearly amount awarded of $1,249,420. DOIM FACULTY WITH VA APPOINTMENTS: - Faculty with DoIM joint appointments at the VA receiving funding through the Biomedical Research Instit ute of New Mexico (BRINM) totaling $7,675,022. This funding included a total in excess of $3.2 million dollars from NIH, over $2.1 million dollars from pharmaceutical companies, $1 million startup funding from BRINM, $65.5 thousand from internal UNM fundi ng, and over $1 million from other sources. CTSC/ECHO CLINICAL INVESTIGATORS PROGRAM: - There were four junior faculty members that successfully completed the CTSC/ECHO Clinical Investigators' Program during this fiscal year. The scholars that completed th e program were Mary Ramos from the Department of Pediatrics, Jess Schwartz from the Department of Surgery, and both Isaac Tawill and Bryan Upham from the Department of Emergency Medicine. - The CTSC/ECHO Clinical Investigators' Program, under the auspices of the Office of Research, awarded a $10,000 grant to CTSC scholar, Arpad Zolyomi, MD, Department of Anesthesiology, for his work on the Bacterial Contamination in the Operating Room'. TRAVEL FUNDS: - The Office of Research provided $13,398 to support travel by 7 fellows and 7 residents presenting 10 abstracts at national and regional meetings including eight presentations at the AFMR Western Division meetings at Carmel, CA in January 2010. RESEARCH: - The Office of Research maintained the database of contract and grant applications submitted and awards made, and produced needed reports as required. - The Office of Research maintained the department's inventory of (wet and dry) laboratory space and provided information for requests for lab space for new faculty members. - The Office of Research provided financial incentives to the department's members of the Human Research Review Committee to attend a total of 43 meetings of this IRB totaling $2,600 for the year. - A total of 94 awards, submitted through the departmen t, were made to 38 faculty members of the department as Principal Investigators of record. The distribution of the numbers of proposals submitted and awards received by funding agency is shown in Figure 1 below. 54 - A total of 86 proposals and 60 awards , submitted through the School of Medicine in the Cancer, Research & Treatment Center, the Center for Infectious Disease & Immunity, or the New Mexico Tumor Registry were made to 22 faculty members who have an appointment in the department and served as th e Principal Investigator of record. See Figure 2 . 55 - As is evident, federal funding continues to be the principal source of extramural funding for the Department of Internal Medicine. Of the 136 proposals submitted in 2009 -10, 55 proposals (40%) d irectly requested federal funds totaling $13,098,235, almost 58% of all funds requested. The bulk of these federal funds were requested from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) \u2014 30 proposals (22%) requested $8,617,081 (38% of all funds requested). In addition, requests directly to NIH and other federal agencies by faculty in the department submitted 22 proposals (16%) requesting $2,261,937 (10%) in the form of sub-awards. The agencies offering these sub -awards are generally themselves funded by NIH or other federal agencies. Thus, requests for federal funds most likely account for 68% of all funds requested and 73% of all funds received for projects with faculty members of the Department of Internal Medicine as the Principal Investigator for the project . - The primary sources of funding continued to be federal sources accounting for approximately 56% of the funds received for projects with Principal Investigators who are faculty members in the Department of Internal Medicine. The distribution by the type of funding agency of the amounts requested in proposals and the amounts received in awards is shown in Figure 3 for faculty submitting through the department and Figure 4 for department faculty who submitted through other School of Medicine departments. 56 57 - Of the 222 proposals submitted by faculty members of the department, 136 proposals with 59 faculty members as principal investigators were submitted through the Department of Internal Medicine. Of the remaining 86 proposals, 61 were submitted through the Cancer Research and Treatment Center (CRTC); 13, through the Center for Infectious Disease and Immunity (CIDI); 11, through the New Mexico Tumor Registry (NMTR); and 1 through the Clinical Trials Center. - Of the 136 proposals submitted through the Dep artment of Internal Medicine, 98% were processed through the Office of Research. Figure 5 shows the number of proposals processed through the Office of Research since the fiscal year 1999 -2000 (FY00). As can be seen, proposals processed through the Office of Research since that period has increased by 43%. The effect of the creation of the Center for Infectious Disease and Immunity (CIDI) is also evident. This alternative path for submission reduced proposals submitted through the Office of Research by 16% . - - The Biomedical and Research Institute of New Mexico (BRINM) reported that DOIM faculty received funding from a number of sources. Figure 6 provides the agencies and dollar amounts awarded for each sponsor. 58 - DOIM faculty with VA joint a ppointments received over $7.6 million in funding for their research endeavors. The following listing outlines the details of this funding. 59 - Proposals processed by the Office of Research are reviewed to verify compliance with the policies and procedure s of UNM/HSC as well as those of the sponsoring agency. Principal Investigators are notified of errors and omissions and instructed to rectify them before the proposal is forwarded to the HSC PreAward Office in the Financial Services Division for final rev iew prior to submission. - In FY10, Christine Pacheco provided substantial assistance to the department faculty submitting proposals for funding including the faculty who successfully submitted electronic proposals through Grants.gov. This assistance includ ed preparation of internal and agency budgets and forms, liaison with the funding agency and proposed sub awardees of UNM, assistance with cost -share budgets, forms and approvals, preparation of Memoranda of Understanding, and other facets of application preparation as appropriate. - To support its efforts to assist faculty members seeking and administering external funds the Office of Research kept current on appropriate internal and external opportunities, policies, and procedures. Toward this end, Ms. Pac heco, attended 60 monthly meetings of the Research Administrator's Network and the Financial Services LEARN group, teleconferences conducted by the National Council of University Research Administrators, and attended the NCURA Leadership Development Conferenc e, regional and national meetings of the National Council of University Research Administrators (NCURA). She co -presented a workshop on Understanding Conflict and Conflict Management and co -presented a session on Effective Meetings: Producing Results at the NCURA Region VI/VII regional meeting in Newport Beach, California. Ms. Pacheco led a discussion group on Understanding Conflict and Conflict Management and co -presented a session on Tools and Tips for the Department Research Administrator: Break ing Bad Faculty Habits at the NCURA National Meeting in Washington, DC. Ms. Pacheco also participated as a panelist for NCURA's Departmental Administration Neighborhood Online Chat in April 2010 entitled, Departmental & Central Administration: Critical Roles and Communication. - Peer reviewed research proposals and awards play a significant role in the department. In the year past, 29 faculty members of the department served as Principal Investigators on projects that received 60 peer -reviewed awards tota ling $11,819,327.

NIH made 43 awards totaling $14,983,343 for projects with department faculty members as the Principal Investigator or Project Director. These awards were 23% of the awards received and provided 49% of the extramural funds suppor ting projects with members in the department as the Principal Investigator or Project Director. - The second largest source of support in FY10 was from pharmaceutical companies and other industry sources. There were 65 industry sponsor awards that provided a total of $6,357,031 in extramural support. These contracts provided 36% of the awards and 20.8% of the funds supporting projects with department faculty members as the Principal Investigator or Project Director. - During FY10, contracts with state and lo cal government agencies provided faculty, with appointments in the department, the third largest source of extramural funding. Eight contracts with state and local agencies provided a total of $1,240,760, which constituted 4% of extramural support. - The fou rth largest source of support was from subawards. Twenty -eight subawards provide a total of $2,072,121 in extramural support. These subawards provided 15.5% of the awards and 6.8% of the funds supporting projects with department faculty members and the P rincipal Investigator or Project Director. Subawards to the department are almost invariably made by institution with a primary award from NIH or another federal agency such as HRSA or AHRQ. - Other federal agencies include HRSA and AHRQ. In FY10, departme nt faculty were awarded a total of 23 awards that provided a total of $4,577,835 in extramural support. This funding provided 12.7% of the awards and 14.9% of the funds supporting projects for faculty with assignments in the department. 78 - On the assumption that subawards pass through federal funds combining NIH awards, subawards, and direct awards of other federal funds shows that 54% of the awards and 73% of the support for projects in the Department of Internal Medicine are federal in origin. - As shown in Figure 7 , both the requested and awarded F&A for proposals applied for by faculty through the department appears to have dropped slightly in FY10. With a 4% decrease from last year in requested F&A and a 29% decrease from last year in awarded F&A dollars. - The Office of Research maintained its database of contract and grant applications submitted by, and awards made to, faculty members of the department. Reports of activity were periodically provided to the department's Chair, Administrator, and Division Chiefs. Other reports were provided as requested by the department's Chair, Administrator, or faculty members. - The Office of Research's Contract and Grant Administrator, Ms. Pacheco monitored data posted by NIH. NIH's posting of awards made was periodically checked against institutional data to ensure the accuracy of the data reported by NIH. As any errors were detected, corrections were sent to NIH and the data monitored to ensure that these corrections were properly entered. 79 CLINICAL & TRANSLATIONAL SCIENCE CENTER: - The CTSC/ECHO Clinical Investigators' Program, under the auspices of the Office of Research, made another Large Grant for Research award of $10,000. These grants are used to jump -start research projects for junior faculty who are participating in the CTSC/ECHO Clinical Investigators' Program. The award is utilized for grant writing expenses; expenses associated with research projects conducted by the faculty member, a resident, or a student, or to enhance the resea rch infrastructure of the department. During the past fiscal year, $10,000 was awarded to Dr. Arpad Zolymoi, from the Department of Anesthesiology and Critical Care, to offset his research project in the area of Bacterial Contamination in the Operating R oom'. - During FY10, the Office of Research provided partial support for seven fellows and seven residents to present fourteen abstracts at regional or national meetings. Travel grants of up to $1,000 were made to these fellows and residents. The fellows we re Drs. Lina E. Aguirre and Jeffrey Stanley (Pulmonary/Sleep Medicine). The resident awards were made to Drs. Ihab Alomari (Office of Education), Cristina Arriens (Office of Education), (Gastroenterology), and Moustafa Youssef (Office of Education). Fellows presented four abstracts and residents presented three abstracts at the AFMR Western Division Meetings in Carmel, CA. The fellows awarded presented one abstracts at the American Society of Nephrology - Rena l Week conference in San Diego, the 30th Annual Dialysis Conference in Seattle, and the Associated Professional Sleep Societies Conference in San Antonio. The residents presented on abstract at the American Thoracic Society International Conference in New Orleans, and three abstracts at the Digestive Disease Week in New Orleans. The Office of Research provided a total of $13,397.73 to support travel to these meetings. - The Office of Research cooperated with the Clinical Trials Center in providing clinical trials service for the faculty of the Department of Internal Medicine. During the past year, usage by the department's faculty accounted for 95% of the Clinical Trials Center's activity. In FY10, there were ten faculty that utilized the Center. - The Offic e of Research supported the Clinical and Translational Science Center (CTSC)\u2014formerly known as the General Clinical Research Center (GCRC) by providing administrative support to the CTSC and conducts the CTSC Clinical Investigators' Program \u2014formerly known as the GCRC Scholars' Program. During this year, the Office of Research's Sr. Contract and Grant Administrator, Christine Pacheco, recorded the minutes of the monthly meetings of the CTSC Advisory Committee. Drafts of the minutes were distributed to membe rs of the committee for comment and the amended draft was presented for formal approval at the next meeting of the CTSC Advisory Committee. - The Office of Research conducted the CTSC/ECHO Clinical Investigators' Program \u2014formerly known as the GCRC Scholar's Program \u2014that continues to provide excellent opportunities for scholars to enhance their clinical research skills under the direction of experienced clinical researchers and staff expert in areas related 80 to conducting research and presenting the findings. During FY10, four scholars were active in the CTSC/ECHO Clinical Investigators' Program. These junior researchers were drawn from a broad range of departments of the Health Sciences Center \u2014 Department of Anesthesiology, Department of Emergency Medicine, Dep artment of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Department of Pediatrics, and the HSC Library and Informatics Center. The Office of Research administratively supported the program by scheduling monthly meetings, processing reimbursements to the participating mentor s, and managing the grant selection process. - During FY10, four investigators successfully completed the program and one participant withdrew because of other commitments. New members were not recruited to fill the vacancies in the program. At the end of FY 10, 2 scholars were active in the program. - The value of the CTSC/ECHO Clinical Investigators' Program is evidenced by the fact that since entering the program, participating young investigators have succeeded in securing funding to support their projects a nd in publishing their results. Dr. Jennifer Taylor -Cousar, a recent graduate of the program in the Department of Internal Medicine, recently received the 2009 Cystic Fibrosis Research, Inc. (CFRI) Professional of the Year Award. The award recognizes her dedication in providing and directing a Cystic Fibrosis (CF) Center at UNMH, the only CF center in the state. During the past fiscal year, 2 active scholars and graduates of the program received 10 awards of extramural funds totaling $119,118 to support t heir projects. This brings the total amount of extramural funding received, by 59 total funded participants in the program, to just over $17 million since the program began eleven years ago. - Both the number of scholars with publications and the average nu mber of publications per scholar increased dramatically after the scholars entered the CTSC Clinical Investigators' Program. Though 2006 \u2014the last year for which data is available \u2014prior to entering the program, 19 of the participants had a total of 86 publications; 59 scholars had no publications. After beginning the program, 47 of the 78 scholars have published a total of 362 publications. The number of published scholars more than doubled and the average number of publications per published scholar incre ased from 4.5 to 10.6. OTHER ACTIVITIES: - Beginning in June 2000, the department started providing financial incentives to its representatives on the Human Research Review Committee to attend these committee meetings to review protocols involving research on human subjects. During this year, the Office of Research monitored attendance by the department's representatives and requested reimbursement when the faculty member had attended at least five meetings of this IRB. During FY10, four faculty members rece ived incentives for attending a total of 41 HRRC meetings. - Through the use of bulletin boards and e -mail notices, the Office of Research keeps faculty and staff apprised of new developments in the Office of Research, the Pre - Award Office, other HSC offices , and NIH and other funding agencies. The office also disseminates information on new opportunities to obtain funds from sources outside the University of New Mexico. Faculty members are encouraged to discuss 81 any difficulties or obstacles they face when co nducting research activities. This allows the Office to act as a liaison between the HSC Pre -Award Office, the Financial Services Division, other faculty, and staff to facilitate the progress of the department's research activity. B. PLANS AND RECOMMENDA TIONS FOR THE NEAR F UTURE - Continue to assist faculty and administrative staff with federal electronic submission via Grants.gov. - Keep current with University and agency policies and procedures affecting research and funding by attending meetings of th e Research Administrators Network, the National Council of University Research Administrators, and the National Institutes of Health. - Inform departmental faculty and staff of changes in policies and procedures affecting both conducting research and securin g funds to support it. - Monitor research activities \u2014contract and grant proposals and awards \u2014 by division and -report the results to the department's chair, administrator, and division chiefs.

SIGNIFICANT DEVELOPEMENTS DURING THE ACADEMIC YEAR UNM - The clinical efforts of the division continue to expand and contribute to the Department of Medicine's bottom line. The four cost centers comprising the current product line - cardiac rehab, heart station, cath labs and clinics - each demonstrated significant increases in clinical activity compared to FY'09. Specifically, u sing the UNMH activity metrics (stats), our heart station (non -invasive imaging, stress testing, Holter monitor, ECG) increased by 16%; the invasive cath labs (comprising both coronary angiographic and electrophysiologic studies and interventions) increase d by 15%; the clinics (5 ACC and Medical Arts) increased by 30%. Overall, the Product Line demonstrated a 10% increase in clinical activity. - Additions to several of these programs deserve special note. - Dr. Robert Taylor has been appointed Medical Director of the Heart Station and echo lab, effective July, 1, 2009. Among the important tasks of this position are continuing quality improvement initiative, echo lab certification, creation of, and integration with, a clinical database; and finally training of ou r fellows. - Dr Mel Peralta has been appointed Medical Director of the in -patient on 7S. This unit not only serves as the geographic home for most cardiology patients at UNMH, but also as the focus of the division's main initiative in the area of quality and outcomes assessment in cardiovascular disease. Building on our successes in the AHA GWTG -CAD initiative, the division's efforts have now turned to the area of heart failure. Dr Peralta will thus serve not only as the overseer of the educational and qua lity improvement efforts on 7S, but will be the division's point person for the upcoming TJC site visit (see below) for advanced certification of the in -patient heart failure program. - The now 1 -year-old cath labs, under Dr Ricciardi's capable direction, continue to grow in volume and stature. UNM door to balloon times for patients presenting with ST elevation acute myocardial infarction continue to rank in the top decile of UHC member institutions. Kudos to Drs Ricciardi, Sheldon and Osborn for not only initiating this effort 4 years ago, but maintaining it over these years. Cath lab stats for FY '10 are 112% of FY'09. - The EP program, under Dr Shmuel Inbar, has also exhibited significant growth in activity and clinical presence. Despite his role as the provider of EP services at UNM, Dr Inbar has grown the outpatient clinic by over 200% and cath -lab based EP activity by 173% of FY'09. Clearly, additional help at the faculty and technical support level will be needed to support further increases in activ ity. - On the professional side (UNM Medical Group), total RVUs increased from 47, 688 in FY'09 to 57, 716 in FY'10 (+21%); charges increased from $7.93 million (FY'09) to 101 $8.56 million in FY'10 (+7.9%); collections increased from $1.61 million (FY'09) to $1.92 FY' 10 (+19%). Evolution of the UNMH \"Product Line\" Given the priority assigned at the national level, and the local level here at UNM,, to Quality and Outcomes, their assessment and improvement, a significant change in direction of the (p reviously exclusively) clinical Product Line to a more focused effort towards obtaining TJC advanced certification in heart failure is taking place. Building on our success in the AHA GWTG program, we have dedicated much effort over the past year to organ ize a truly inter -disciplinary effort (http://hsc.unm.edu/som/medicine/cardiology/HeartFailure.shtml ). Under the direction of Dr Laskey, this effort has included extant division al providers - Drs. Taylor, Vos and Voyles at the faculty level and PA Sanchez and NPs Mayo, Hawkins and Miranda at the mid-level level - along with key administrative personnel from the UNMH office of Quality (Cathy Jaco, RN) and nursing (CNO, Sheena Fergu son, RN), faculty members from Family Medicine and Hospitalist Medicine, dietary/nutrition services and pharmacy service (special thanks go to Lauren Silus for her untiring efforts in this regard). The level of support from nursing, notably Melissa Johnso n, RN on 7S, and extending to other units within UNMH, has been truly astonishing and underscores the institution - wide approach to this disease. We are looking forwarded to the TJC visit in mid - September and getting the go -ahead to proceeding with the ext ension of this effort to the post-discharge, out -patient arena. NMVAMC The cardiology division at the VA hospital has made great strides this year in augmenting its clinical and research strength. -Dr Michael West, staff electrophysiologist, was hired in June, 2010. -Dr Richard Snider was hired in 2009 as a full -time staff cardiologist. We remember Rick from his time as a fellow here at UNM several years ago and he now returns with a focus on teaching and education. Welcome back Rick! -Dr Ratliff has con tinued to serve on several VA Cooperative Trials groups and is a member of the steering committee of an upcoming VACT study -With Dr Charlton's renewed dedication to informatics and outcomes, the cardiovascular research effort at the NMVAMC should continue to grow. Dr Charlton will be collaborating with the VA -based outcomes group and will be able to access the VA database for fellow -initiated research efforts. -Last, but certainly not least, a sincere thank you to Dr Icenogle for keeping the wheels on the bus these past few years. With his dedicated work ethic and his over -arching goal of maintaining an all -around academic program at the VA, Dr Icenogle may now see the fruits of these hard -earned efforts. 102 B. SIGNIFICANT PLANS AND RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE NE AR FUTURE - The division continues to recruit additional faculty in the areas of general/preventive cardiology, heart failure and cardiovascular imaging. - Plans are again underway for the construction of a new multi -modality out -patient facility; this facili ty will house all divisional out -patient activities including heart failure, cardiac rehab, state -of-the-art cardiac echo, peripheral vascular disease diagnosis and management, and nuclear cardiologic testing. - The division's commitment to cardiovascular ou tcomes will continue with obtaining TJC certification in heart failure in late 2010 and continued participation in the GTWG program (currently we are Gold Award recipients for several years running) The structural heart disease program, a collaborative eff ort between adult and pediatric cardiology, will continue to grow, particularly with the availability of percutenous valve technology. Given the number of patients in the adult congenital heart disease program with late sequelae of RVOT surgeries performed in early childhood, this technology will have substantial impact. C. EDUCATION/TEACHING Fellowship Program developments and updates - The fellowship program continues to expand training opportunities. The adult congenital heart disease in tandem with the pe diatric congenital heart disease program provides a unique opportunity to observe the continuum of disease in this enlarging patient group. This same rotation also includes exposure to new modalities for CV imaging, e.g., CT and MR, particularly as they re late to structural heart disease. The dedicated EP rotation at UNMH provides for one -on-one interactions, on a structured basis, with a geographic full-time faculty person. With invasive EP services now available at UNMH, fellows are expected to participat e in the decision -making and conduct of these procedures. - After 9 years of dedicated efforts, and excellent results, Dr. Gerald Charlton will step down as Fellowship Program Director on December 31, 2010. Dr. Mark Sheldon has accepted this role going for ward. For Jerry, this is perfect time to return to the practice of cardiology and for Mark, this represents substantial opportunity to consolidate his career goal as clinical educator at UNM. Our sincere best wishes to both! a.

OUTSIDE PROFESSIONAL ACTIVITIES OF FACULTY/ST AFF MEMBERS Community Outreach Dr Laskey continues to work with the New Mexico Chapter of the American Heart Association. These efforts have led to expanded involvement at the national level as well in matters relating to health policy and health care del ivery. Dr Laskey was President -elect of the chapter for FY '09 - '10 and assumes the role as President for FY '11, 12. As a result of this activity, the chapter will see further integration of the stroke and cardiovascular programs . Beginning as a research p roject with Jude Gabaldon in 2009, a collaborative program involving the cardiology division, the NM chapter of the American Heart Association and the Albuquerque public school system was initiated with the goal of educating high school students in CPR. Grant support from Medtronic, Inc has allowed this effort to be remarkably successful to date. Current cardiology fellow Nate Boyer has taken this program into several Albuquerque high schools and has been very well received. Based on the success of this pi lot program, we now plan to expand this effort to all high schools in the APS system. The success of the program is being tracked with a dedicated data collection form and it is hoped that the results will elucidate strengths and weaknesses of health care education efforts in New Mexico. Dr. Achrekar has a monthly health and wellness column titled \"The Good Doctor\" in the Albuquerque Local IQ Magazine, which has distribution to over 300,000 people in the community. His column has been running since early 2008 and topics have ranged from How to find a primary care doctor to How to lower your cholesterol. This venue provides readers an open forum in which to ask health related questions to Dr. Achrekar a UNM faculty member. 108 DIVISION OF ENDOCR INOLOGY 109 DIVISION OF ENDOCRINOLOGY ANNUAL REPORT: JULY 1, 2009 - JUNE 30, 2010 DAVID S.

SIGNIFICANT DEVELOPMENTS DURING THE ACADEMIC YEAR The following highlights activities of the Division during the 2010 fiscal year. Education - The Division of Epidemiology and Biostatistics has continued to actively teaching Medical Students the basics of epidemiologic study design and basic biostatistics during the year. This program further expands into the c ore medical school curriculum, led by Dr. Charles Wiggins. - Dr. Marianne Berwick has led the epide miology educational program in the CTSA's Master's of Science in Clinical R esearch this academic year and Dr. Huining Kang and Dr. Sang -Joon Lee have led the biostatistics educational program in the same venue. - A proposal was submitted to HRSA to fund a re sidency training program in preventive medicine with Dr. Kesler as PI and director. At the close of the fiscal year, the division received notice that an award is anticipated with a July 2010 start. Research - Faculty in the Division were involved in a bro ad array of research endeavors in areas that include cancer, environmental, and occupational health (see faculty grant support). - New faculty during this time period is Cristina Murray -Krezen who was previously a biostatistician for the EMMES Corporation in Rockville, Maryland, a scientific consulting firm. - The division managed a contracts and grants portfolio totaling approximately 1.2 million dollars, excluding those grants managed by contracts and grants personnel in the Cancer Center and the New Mexico Tumor Registry. Grants awarded in the Cancer Center to Division Faculty total approximately 2.2 million dollars. Clinical/Service - Four primary faculty in the Division had clinical responsibilities: Dr. Kesler focused in the area of Environmental/Occupat ional Medicine; Richard Hoffman, focused on screening for colorectal and prostate cancer; Glen Murata, focused on Health Services Research, and Ellen Yee, focused on screening issues. The last three have appointments at the VA with their primary home in t he Division of Epidemiology and Biostatistics. - One additional, secondary faculty member also had clinical responsibilities: Dr. Herman (Geriatrics). - As the fiscal year drew to a close a finalist was selected and an offer made to a candidate to replace Dr. Wagner in Employee Health. 118 B. SIGNIFICANT PLANS FOR THE FUTURE (FY10) Education - Dr. Linda Cook and Dr. Marianne Berwick are spearheading an effort to develop a Ph.D. concentration in epidemiology in the BSGRP program. Research Refinement of the organi zational structure for cancer prevention and outreach is expected to take place the hiring of faculty in Molecular Epidemiology and Cancer Health Disparities. The Division expects to partner with others in the UNMHSC community to pursue grant funding in the area of health disparities. C.

MA, M.D., PH.D. PROFESSOR OF MEDICIN E, CELL BIOLOGY AND PHYSIOLOGY CHIEF OF GASTROENTER OLOGY AND HEPATOLOGY A. SIGNIFICANT ACCOMPLISHM ENTS AND DEVELOPMENTS During the past academic year (July 1, 2009 - June 30, 2010), Gastroenterology (G.I.) and Hepatology Division has made many important and significant advances in all academic areas including research, clinical, and educational activi ties. The G.I. Fellowship Training Program has been greatly upgraded with important changes further emphasizing education and training. The research programs have been greatly enhanced with increases in grant funding and expansion of the basic science re search program, and the divisional clinical productivity has remained at a very high level during the review period. The UNM G.I. Division research investigators had an outstanding year as evidenced by over 47 research publications and over $15.5 million dollars in total NIH, VA, and federal government supported research funding. Education For the eighth year in a row, top two percentile of the fellowship applicants were matched into our fellowship program. This emphasizes the highest quality of fellows in our training program and is further evidence of the excellent progress the Division has made in providing an excellent training program. The G.I. fellowship training and education program has been completely overhauled during the past seven years to op timize the training and education experience of the G.I. fellows and rotating Residents. During the past eight years, the total fellowship positions have been increased from 5 to 12 positions. The increase in the number of fellowship positions has decrea sed the clinical service burden and increased the training opportunity. The gastroenterology teaching conferences have been revised and upgraded. Thursday afternoons (3 - 4 hours) have been designated strictly for educational conferences. The core curricu lum conferences are held on a weekly basis and cover the core topics in gastroenterology. The weekly core curriculum module is moderated by a faculty member having an expertise in the selected disease topic. Over the three year fellowship training progra m all relevant core topics in G.I. are covered. In addition, Journal Club, Research conferences, monthly clinical case conferences, and bi -weekly G.I./Radiology/Surgery combined conferences are held to discuss any interesting or difficult clinical cases a nd relevant clinical topics. For the monthly G.I. Grand Rounds, world -renowned experts in various G.I. diseases are invited to provide insight into the latest advances in treatment of G.I. diseases. Additionally, six to eight research experts are invited throughout the year to discuss the latest advances in G.I. Research. The UNM G.I. Fellowship program is a dynamic program always looking for ways to improve the training 132 process. The stated goal of the Gastroenterology Division is to have the best G.I. Fellowship training program in the country. Clinical The clinical productivity of the G.I. Division remains at a very high level. All of the faculty continues to have clinical productivity above the top 10th percentile based on clinical RVUs. The total c linical billing for the 2009 -2010 academic year was $7,402,477 (compared to $6,570,601 for 2008 $5,603,258 for -2004; 200 2- 2003; and $2,517,000 for 2001 -2002). The total G.I. Division revenue generated for the 2009 - 2010 academic year was $2,031,516 (compare d to $1,941, 960 for 2008 -2009; $1,659,557 for 2007 2002 -2003; and $640,000 for the 2001 -2002). Thus, the overall clinical productivity of the G.I. Division remains outstanding. Research With the arrival of Dr. Thomas Ma as the Division Chief in January, 2002, there has been a major expansion of basic and clinical research programs. Recent additions of Dr. Henry C. Lin (clinician and lab scientist with expertise in translational research in the fields of intestinal motility and transit) as the Ch ief of G.I. Section at the VAMC further strengthen the expanding G.I. research program. The total research funding in G.I. Division exceeds $15.5 million in research funding. As a comparison, the total research funding in 2000 -2001 academic year was zero. Thus, the growth in research funding has been outstanding. There were over 47 publications from the Division during the academic year. Several faculty have international reputation in research and serve on key national research grant study sections. Dr. Ma serves as Chair of VA Merit Review Board and member of NIH study sections, Dr. Boedeker serves as a member of NIH study section and Dr. Lin serves on a NIH study section. The research program and research opportunity for the G.I. fellows have also b een greatly expanded during the past three and a half years. All G.I. fellows have been provided with minimum of 6 months of protected time for research and given an opportunity to pursue both clinical and basic science research. There is also a dedicate d academic track with 18 months of protected research time. With greater emphasis and opportunity for research involvement, all second and third year G.I. fellows have participated in important research projects and have presented abstracts at a national or regional scientific meeting. B. SIGNIFICANT PLANS AND RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE NEAR FUTURE A major goal for the G.I. Division in the upcoming year is to expand on the improvements achieved during the last academic year in education, research, and clinical activities. A top 133 priority of the Division is to continue expansion of G.I. endoscopic procedure area. Recently, Center for Digestive Diseases was opened, which provides state -of-the-art clinical care in digestive diseases. One of the top priorities of t he Division continues to be Faculty recruitment. Since the demand for G.I. services remains very high, recruitment of new Faculty remains an important priority. The goal for the upcoming year is to recruit 2 new faculty at UNMHSC and 1 new faculty at the VAMC. An important goal for the Division is to continue to increase funding in both clinical and basic research in the new academic year. During the last four years, a major initiative in the complete re -hauling of the education program was undertaken. The new changes have made a huge impact in the fellowship training program. Full implementation of education activities will continue to occur in the 2010 -2011 academic year and beyond. C.

As for the HSC, we in GIM take our mission to care for the poor very seriously and currently lead the country in how we train medical students to understand the needs of the poor. This is an active are a of educational development in GIM, lead by Dr Cynthia Arndell, and our goal is to train doctors with an enhanced sense of compassion and social justice. FY10 Accomplishments 1. Continuation of Phase I Social Determinants of Health Course (2 sessions) as we ll as the Homeless Panel Discussion/interview (1 session) in Foundations of Clinical Practice . 2. Development and piloting of Health Equity: Introduction to Principles of Public Health Course . This 2 week course was piloted on 24 students in 2009 (with very p ositive reviews) and will be required of all entering Phase I students in 2010. 3. Development and piloting of Post Discharge Home Visit Experience (medical and pharmacy students) for IM Clerkship . Focus is on health literacy and cultural diversity. 4. Developme nt and piloting of Street Medicine Elective - collaborative undertaking between HSC (CON, COP, SOM) and community homeless health clinics/respite shelters ( e.g HCH, Barrett House) to give students hands on experience in street medicine. Primary Care - Working in a public medical center has its challenges but also opportunities. Caring for people of diverse backgrounds and at times desperate circumstances keeps us grounded in the need to not only treat all individuals compassionately but also safely and efficiently. It is now recognized that new systems of care utilizing new technologies, new administrative structures for decision -making, and new team -based approaches have tremendous potential to revolutionize how we care for people. In Primary Care, Drs Fritch, Leverence, Adolphe, and Voss are harnessing the energies of a diverse array of departments, services, and clinics across the institution to develop an innovative Patient Centered Medical Home - truly our own version of Health System Reform. 147 FY10 Accomplishments Patient Centered Medical Home - have worked closely with UH Administrators. o Invited TransforMed Consultants to review our readiness and strategic plan. o PCMH Conference 3/9/10 - attended by 110 staff & providers o Appointed PCMH Program manage r o Created PCMH strategic plan. o Created Committee to measure Outcomes. o Created Guidelines Task Force o Received NCQA Level 1 PCMH certification (first practice in New Mexico) Integrative Medicine - The tremendous advances in western medicine over the past ce ntury have also come with a growing awareness of its deficiencies. Human's experience suffering - not kidneys or livers; prevention is worth more than a pound of cure; and ultimately the patient is the healer and we as providers are merely the coaches. Thi s new orientation is essential to any true health system reform and we are fortunate to have the visionary Dr Arti Prasad lead the University of New Mexico in becoming a premier academic integrative center. Please see attached Integrative Medicine Annual R eport. Hospital Medicine - The Section of Hospital Medicine has had an eventful year with increases. We have had a continued increase in census levels and have added 5 faculty members and 1 mid-level . We had 1 mid -level move to another department and 1 d eployed to Iraq. Our most significant efforts and achievement this year have been in the development and use of our online collaborative area (wiki) at www.unmhospitalist.pbworks.com . Our goal has be en complete transparency in our processes and development of new material through participation of all of our members. Our website, which is accessible by everyone, has all of our policies and procedures including resident handbooks and references. It currently has 292 unique web-pages and 333 articles and files uploaded. It is heavily used by faculty and residents in every area of our functioning. We have continued to grow our leadership team adding roles in director for research (Dr Rush Pierce) and D irector of Process Improvement and Standard Work (Dr Jason Cohen.) We supported Dr Cohen in receiving additional training in Lean Processes and have been working with the medical group to develop inpatient projects. We have also begun work towards devel oping our research goals . We submitted 7 posters this year and had 4 accepted at national conferences. With Dr Pierce's guidance we have established mentorship models for research and have made connections with the IRB and other resources at UNM. We hav e established goals for producing research as well as mentoring residents for each faculty member. We have focused our quality activities around 4 areas: VTE prophylaxis, Glycemic Control, Infection Control, and Care Transitions. Workgroups are active in all of these areas and among 575 hospitals we were identified as a Top 10 Hospital in Glycemic Control. We are addressing hand washing and have seen MD compliance increase; we are starting projects around prevention of central line infections and standard s for Foley catheter placements on the medicine 148 wards. We continue our work on Care Transitions, having developed standardized discharge paperwork and now working on discharge to other facility processes. We have established weekly Best Practice Meetings that are well attended by faculty and residents (including VA MC) and covering common inpatient processes with the goal of standardizing practice. All of our lectures are recorded and available online at unmhospitalist.pbworks.com/best -practices -schedule . The goal of each meeting is the development of a protocol or process to ensure adherence to best practices and these are listed on the wiki. Professionalism - Dr Bronwyn Wilson developed new Clinician Educator promotion criteria which were approved by t he executive committee of DoIM. These criteria delineate the scholarship necessary for CE faculty to demonstrate excellence while they also respect and preserve the unique role these faculty play. Dr Leverence developed and piloted a Professionalism Survey to assist in the new CE promotion process as well as the TJC Professional Practice Evaluations. Dr Leverence also lead the development of a shared goal and decision making policy among UH administrators and SOM Medical Directors. This is being piloted in Ambulatory care. B. SIGNIFICANT PLANS AND RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE FUTURE Education - GIM Faculty will continue their very active role in medical education. We are developing an Ambulatory Care component in our IM Clerkship. We will journey through our first year of the new Integrative Medicine and Primary Care Residency tracks. Dr Pierce has also been chosen to assist in the development of a Preventive Medicine residency track. Poverty Medicine - 1. Continue above initiatives including implementing the Post DC Home Visit Experience and Street Medicine Elective . 2. Fully implement the Health Equity: Intro to Principles of Public Health Course as well as develop evaluative component. 3. Apply for HRSA and other grant funding. Primary Care - Within the PCMH initiativ e we plan to further develop our processes and systems and apply for level 3 NCQA PCMH recognition. Lean Process methodology will be applied. We have recently decided on quality, clinical, access, and survey Outcome Measures and will create a dashboard to not only monitor our progress in these important domains but also publish our findings. Hospital Medicine - Over the coming year we are planning for the future including expansion of our consultative service and development of plans to provide night time c overage. As our service continues to expand, we anticipate further faculty hiring and are planning for integration with Sandoval County. We also plan to re -initiate our discharge clinic and are interviewing for this position, we may also expand into pre -op consultations. 149 Professionalism - Continue work and expand on HSC shared goal and decision making policy. Participate in Lean Process (Dr Leverence, Dr Fritch, and Dr Cohen). Apply new CE Promotion Criteria. We have also recently implemented a monthly Pr ofessionalism Morning Report which has been very well received - we will continue to develop this. C.

SIGNIFICANT DEVELOPMENTS DURING THE ACADEMIC YEAR, 2009 -2010 Research The Division organizes and supervises all clinical oncology research for the UNM Health Science Center. In CY2009, the Division administrated 327 UNM Cancer Center (UNMCC) protocols, of which 114 studies were therapeutic/interventional trials. These therapeutic trials are also open within the New Mexico Cancer Care Alliance, and thus 173 accrue not only at UNM but also at numerous affiliated community sites. The Division supervised 434 ac cruals on therapeutic trials, with an additional 90 therapeutic accruals supervised by the Division at the community affiliate sites. Oncology accruals to all types of trials supervised by the Division were 1236 in CY 2009, compared to 633 in CY2005, 577 i n CY2004, 230 in CY2002. Of patients accrued to therapeutic clinical trials in CY 2009, 66% were women, 6% were Native Americans, and 35% were Hispanics. The Division published 45 peer -reviewed papers last year, in high quality journals such as the Jour nal of Clinical Oncology (citation impact 15.4), or Blood (citation impact 10.9). This compares to 41 papers published in FY 2008/9. The Division held $2.68 M in total extra -mural research grants in FY2009/10 academic year. Dr. Hromas obtained one new RO1 grant in DNA repair. Dr. Verschraegen holds an MB-CCOP grant from the NCI. Drs. Verschraegen, Patt, Jones, Bauman, Garcia, Lee, Libby, and Royce hold multiple extra -mural pharmaceutical grants listed below. The Division continues to play a key leade rship role in developing the flow of translational science from laboratory to clinic and back again that is essential for the NCI P30 CCSG to the UNM Cancer Center. The P30 was successfully renewed in 2010 with an outstanding score. Clinical Service The UNM CC is one of 61 NCI -designated cancer centers in the US. The Division supervises all cancer care at the UNM Cancer Center, with Division faculty chairing the UNM HSC Oncology Committee, the policy setting body of the HSC, and serving as Oncology Phy sician in Chief for the UNM Hospital. The Division saw 3577 new cancer patients in CY 2009 at the UNM Cancer Center main clinic, and approximately another 480 new cancer patients at outreach clinics in Lovelace downtown and at Las Cruces. This is comp ared to 25 89 total new cancer patients in 2004 and 1200 in 2000. Thus, in 8 years the number of new cancer patients seen at UNM has gone up significantly. This represents over 40% of the total number of new cancer patients in the state of New Mexico. The D ivision supervised 145,000 out -patient visits in CY 2009 at all its clinic sites, up from 20,000 in 2000. Dr. Rabinowitz serves as the UNM Cancer Center's Out -Patient Clinic Director, and Dr. Lauer is the overall Executive Medical Director for oncology eff orts at the Cancer Center. He also is on the UNM Hospital Executive Medical Board, and serves as the Chair of the Oncology Committee for the UNM HSC. The Division in 2009/10 had responsibility for directing Hematology and Medical Oncology care in the Lovelace Sandia Health Care System, which comprises three area hospitals, Lovelace Downtown, Lovelace West Mesa, and Women's Hospital. This effort continues currently. This system's out -patient Hematology -Oncology clinic was re - organized, key personnel ret ained and others recruited. A new in -patient Hematology - Oncology service was created for Lovelace, and the Division supervi ses a system -wide call schedule . 174 There are 8 multi -disciplinary clinics at the UNM Cancer Center main out -patient clinic, which i s directed by Dr. Rabinowitz. Seven of these are led by members of the Division. These are in breast (led by Dr. Royce), lung (led by Dr. Jones), GI (led by Dr. Lee), hematologic malignancies (led by Dr. Libby), gynecologic malignancies (led by Dr. Muller of Ob -Gyn), GU (led by Dr. Rabinowitz), Radiation Oncology (led by Dr. Schroeder), and Phase I trials (led by Dr. Verschraegen). These continue to function at a high level in the Cancer Center. Such clinics routinely include medical oncology, clinical trials coordinators, surgical oncology, radiology, and radiation oncology. The Division provides the leadership for these multi -disciplinary clinics. These multi -disciplinary clinics also have cognate clinical working groups that prioritize clinical trials and stimulate translational research in collaboration with the basic scientists of the Cancer Center. The Division continues to supervise the Hematology -Oncology in -patient service at UNM Hospital, with Dr. Lee serving as the Medical Director of 5 East, the Oncology Floor, and Dr. Jones serving as Medical Director of 3 East, the Hematology Floor. One of the major clinical accomplishments this year was the successful integration of the oncology care contract with Christus St. Vincent's Hospital in S anta Fe into the Division. This clinic is staffed by Drs. Shaheen and Ferkazad. A research nurse has been hired and clinical trials have been opened there at that site. The Division is organized into 7 Sections, Hematologic Malignancies/Stem Cell Transp lantation led by Dr. Libby, Gastrointestinal Malignancies led by Dr. Lee, Aerodigestive Tumors, led by Dr. Jones, Breast Cancer led by Dr. Royce, Radiation Oncology led by Dr. Liem, Experimental Therapeutics led by Dr. Verschraegen, and Genitourinary Cance r led by Dr. Rabinowitz. This last year the Division successfully moved into the new UNM Cancer Center out - patient clinic building. The new Cancer Center out -patient clinic building will restructure and maximize patient flow, in order to maintain the di sease -specific clinics of the Division. The new building has increased check -in and check -out stations, and increased chemotherapy capacity. The Division successfully integrated the new section of Radiation Oncology into the Division with the move into the new building. This new building has a fully functional and completely integrated electronic medical record system tied to patient scheduling, lab ordering, and chemotherapy system. Thus, the new out-patient building is completely paperless. Education There are currently 4 Hematology -Oncology Fellows in the training program. The fellowship is a mandatory three total years, with a required basic or laboratory research component, with board eligibility in both Hematology and Oncology. This past year we had the fellowship reviewed by the ACGME, and it was given a full 5 year accreditation. We requested a fifth position for FY2009/10 from the ACGME, and this request was granted. However, we have not yet filled that position. So we anticipate that there will b e a fifth fellow in 2010/11. Given the enormous growth of the oncology program at UNM, 175 both in clinical care and in research, there should be an increased educational opportunity for Hematology -Oncology Fellows here at UNM. The Division continues to or ganize the Thursday noon Clinic Clinical Oncology Research Conference (led by Dr. Verschraegen), the Wednesday morning Oncology Journal club (led by Dr. Rabinowitz) , the Wednesday morning didactic fellow/resident lecture series, the Tuesday afternoon UNM -wide ACOS -required Tumor Board (led by Drs. Mangalik and Lee), the Monday afternoon NCCN guidelines lecture, and the monthly City -Wide Hematology Meetings (led by Dr. Libby). The Division continued to distribute to all Residents, Medical Students, and Fe llows that rotate through any oncology clinic or ward the Pocket Hematology -Oncology: Everything You Need to Know at Your Fingertips. This was been updated in 2007, and is available also on the web. The Division holds two didactic educational lectures pe r week for residents and fellows on topics in Hematology -Oncology, one Monday afternoon at 4 PM (NCCN guidelines), and the other Wednesday morning at 7:00 AM (Basics of Hematology -Oncology). Administration Dr. Ian Rabinowitz continues to serve as UN M Cancer Center Out -Patient Clinical Director, and Dr. Libby is the Director of Stem Cell Transplantation for UNM hospital and the Cancer Center. Dr. Lee is Medical Director of 5E in UNMH, the oncology in - patient ward. Dr. Lee also serves on the Pharmacy a nd Therapeutics Committee of UNM Hospital. Dr. Jones is Medical Director of 3E of UNM Hospital, and both he and Dr. Lee sit on the UNMH Medical Directors Committee. Dr. Hromas was recently asked to join another NIH Study Section in his new research area, DNA repair. The new study section is Radiation Therapeutics and Biology (RTB). He continues as Deputy Director of the UNM Cancer Center, and as Director of the Clinical Research Committee, which supervises all clinical oncology research at the HSC. He i s also on the American Society of Hematology Program Committee, and is the Scientific Program co -Chair in 2010 for the annual meeting. He chaired NIH Review Panels for a Program Project grant, for the Stem Cell Niche RFA from the NHLBI, and for the Special Emphasis Panel on the Hematopoietic Stem Cell. Drs. Verschraegen, and Jones served on the NIH Loan Repayment Study Section. Dr. Verschraegen is the Director of Experimental Therapeutics, the Phase I trials arm of the Cancer Center. She is also Dire ctor of the NCI Minority -Based Community Clinical Oncology Program in the UNM Cancer Center. She and Dr. Ginossar received a large supplement to this grant to study minority accruals to clinical trials. Dr. Jones is the Director of the Clinical Protocol and Data Management Shared Resource of the Cancer Center, the administrative office that organizes clinical oncology research. Dr. Royce completed her 3 year term as Chair of the Protocol Review Committee of the UNM Cancer Center, which reviews all UNM on cology clinical protocols for scientific merit and feasibility. Dr. Bauman took over as Chair of that committee this year. Dr. 176 Bauman also leads the new Head and Neck Clinical Working Group. Dr. Verschraegen is the Director of Experimental Therapeutics, wh ich is the Phase I clinical Trials effort, which will be responsible for building an early phase cancer drug development program at the Cancer Center. She also sits on several leadership committees nationally, including the Gynecologic Malignancies Committ ee of ASCO, the major clinical oncology society. Dr. Lauer was also named to the Practice Committee of ASCO this year. Dr. Jones is the Medical Director of the New Mexico Cancer Care Alliance, which brings cutting edge clinical trials to the communi ty. Dr. Verschragen is Chair of the Education Committee of the Alliance. Dr. Lyons continued his directorship of the Signature Program in Infectious Disease of the UNM HSC. Dr. Lauer is the Executive Medical Director of the Cancer Center, and has replace d Dr. Hromas as Oncology Physician -in-Chief for the UNM Hospital. He also now Chairs the Oncology Committee for the UNM HSC, and serves on the Executive Medical Committee of the UNM Hospital. B. SIGNIFICANT PLANS AND RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE NEAR FUTUR E Research Last year clinical research was designated as an area for improvement in anticipation of the renewal of the NCI P30 CCSG. That area was markedly expanded, as described above, and the P30 was successfully re -funded, with an outstanding score. T he goal this year in clinical trials is to improve the efficiency of opening the trials, and in improving the financial arrangements with sponsoring outside entities. Thus, the Division is working the UNM Human Research Review Committee and the WIRB, the t wo major clinical trial review bodies for the Division, to improve speed of protocol review. In addition, the next year will see a major effort in translating UNM science to clinical trials in oncology. There are several areas that this will take place i n, most notably the translation of Dr. Hromas' discovery that the HIV inhibitor raltegravir can potentiate cisplatin by Dr. Bauman. There will be several institutional trials started this year that test the addition of several herbal supplements to various cancer regimens. However, translating novel drugs discovered at UNM to clinical trials remains a complex goal. This clinical trial effort is coordinated by Dr. Verschraegen in Experimental Therapeutics. The challenge for this year is to define 2 -3 spec ific agents that have come from the UNM Cancer Center laboratories that can be translated into Phase I -II clinical trials. Several key targets have been identified, Metnase (from Dr. Hromas' lab) and GPR30 (from Dr. Prossnitz). There are small molecule inh ibitors of these targets in hand. Animal studies are under way to test these inhibitors. One of the Metnase inhibitors appears to significantly increase the efficacy of cisplatin in a murine human lung cancer xenograft model. 177 A major goal of Divisional research is always to increase the number of extra -mural peer - reviewed basic or translational research grants. Dr. Hromas was able to obtain funding for a third new RO1 grant on DNA repair. This grant received the highest score for that study section, and was funded for a full 5 years. However, as a Division there are really only a few extra -mural funded investigators. The goal will be to mentor some of the junior faculty towards peer -reviewed funding. Dr. Bauman will submit an R21 to the NCI for the clini cal trial on potentiating cisplatin in head and neck cancer. Dr. Hromas will submit an NIH NEXT grant to develop the small molecular inhibitors of Metnase. Dr. Shaheen submitted a KO1 award that was funded just recently, under the mentorship of Dr. Hromas. He will also submit an R21 on the role of a novel DNA repair component he has recently discovered. Dr. Garcia will submit an R21 on cancer -induced thrombosis, and Dr. Williamson will submit an R21 on preventing DNA repair in cancer cells after chemotherap y. Dr. Singh will submit a LSS special fellow grant on a novel component of the homologous recombination DNA repair pathway. Clinical Service This year there are three major goals for the Division's clinical service. First, we were awarded the contrac t for oncology service at the St. Vincent's Hospital in Santa Fe, and two new oncologists were hired to provide that service (Shaheen and Fekrazad). However, a third oncologist will be needed there, to cover for vacations and professional leave, and this w ill have to be recruited. While a research nurse has been recruited, and clinical trials opened there, we would like to increase the number of patients accrued to clinical trials at that site. The next major goal for the Division for this year is to sta bilize the Las Cruces outreach clinic. We have recruited one of two oncologists needed there, Dr. Adler. However, we need one more oncologist to be recruited at that site. In addition, the clinical research enterprise needs to be rebuilt there. This will e ntail recruiting a new research nurse at that site. The third major goal is to prepare for the new Sandoval County UNM hospital. This will ultimately entail recruitment of additional clinical faculty. The goal of this expansion is the creation a state -wide cancer care network. We will continue the marketing plan for cancer care at UNM to take advantage of the major accomplishments recently. We will continue to carefully negotiate strategic partnerships with other hospitals and insurance plans in the state . The Division has in the past and will in the future take on additional clinical work load in efforts to expand market share. Once market share is increased additional faculty will be hired to continue this additional clinical care. The Division now super vises cancer care for over 40% of all cancer patients in the state. Education We will seek to i ncrease the clinical trials research training for the Hematology -Oncology fellows. A new required rotation has been added to the fellowship curriculum that is devoted to formal training in clinical research. We will strengthen and formalize the education efforts for residents and fellows on the UNMH Hematology -Oncology in - patient service. We will continue the significant efforts in didactic lectures for Fell ows in 178 Hematology -Oncology and Internal Medicine residents for board review. We also have established a Monday afternoon lecture on cancer care by NCCN guidelines. Administration The major goal for this next year is to redefine the roles of the clinic d irectors, in regards to the cancer center. The administrative structure of the Division has not kept up with the growth of the cancer center clinical operations. Thus, integration of the new roles of the Divisional clinical leadership with the new outreach clinics is a major focus for this year. C. APPOINTMENTS TO FACULTY Clinical Faculty James Lin, MD (VA) Sagus Sampath, MD William Thompson, MD (He rejoined the faculty after 1 year of private practice) William Adler, MD Research Faculty Tamar Ginos sar, PhD D. SEPARATION OF FACULTY Three radiation oncologists separated from the faculty to go into private practice in Albuquerque at Radiation Oncology Associates, where they had practiced prior to joining NM. These are Drs. Paul Anthony, Lisa Berle, and Kutub Khan. In addition, Dr. Richard Lyons left to lead a large infectious disease institute at Colorado State University. While his research faculty (Drs. Lovchik, Wu, and Rushton) remained at UNM, they left our Division for one that was more appropr iate for their research interests in infectious disease. Finally, Dr. Richard Dahl took a tenure track faculty position in the Cancer Center at Notre Dame; he was on the research faculty track here. E. PUBLICATIONS FOR THE DIVISION OF HEMATOLOGY/O NCOLOGY There were 45 papers published by members of the Division in the 2009/10 academic year. This compares to 41 in 2008/9. Some publications are listed twice below to provide credit to distinct faculty members who are co -authors, but are not counted twice in this total. Of note, two articles from Dr. Hromas' group were featured on the cover of the major Hematology journal, Blood.

BANKHURST, M.D. PROFESSOR OF MEDICINE CHIEF, DIVISION OF RHEUMATOLOGY A. SIGNIFICANT ACHIEVEMENTS DURING THE ACADEMIC YEAR - We continue to run the Division of Rheumatology with two full time UNM physicians and two full time VA physicians who constitute the divisional attending staff at UNM, VAMC, IHS -PHS (Albuquerque), Carrie Ting ley Juvenile Arthritis. This staff is an attempt to respond favorably to the new managed care initiatives and accommodate promptly any consultations from the General Medicine staff or elsewhere at the University. Unfortunately, we will need further resour ces to meet these goals. Aside from its extensive educational and clinical program, the Division continues to have the research activities supported by in excess of $1,000,000 of external funding from the federal government and the pharmaceutical industry . The Division published 14 abstracts and manuscripts during the past year. - The Division hosted its 9th Annual Rheumatic Disease Conference in Santa Fe, New Mexico. The conference was held during the weekend of April 30, 2010 - May 1, 2010. There were ov er 62 providers in attendance from around the state of New Mexico, Colorado and Texas. Speakers at the conference included Roy Altman, MD, UCLA, John Cush, MD, Baylor Research Institute, Dan Clauw, MD, University of Michigan, Robert Wortmann, Dartmouth Me dical School, Larry Moreland, MD, University of Pittsburgh, and Leonard Noronha, MD, University of New Mexico. Conference fees were paid with restricted educational grants. B. SIGNIFICANT PLANS AND RECOMMENDATIONS - The overall objective for the D ivision in 2010 -11 is to incorporate the physician - extender (NP) and plan to provide more timely service to patients with rheumatic conditions. We have worked extensively with the Advanced Access team to accomplish this goal. In addition, we will stri ve to continue the level of excellence in teaching, clinical care, and research. We have achieved a level of excellence over the years in teaching, clinical care and research. - The Division is seeking to a 4th fellow. A presentation was made before the r ight sizing committee last year. The decision will be made by hospital officials on or before November, 2010. - The Division lost its mid -level provider during July, 2010. It is difficult to find mid -level providers because of the low salary offered by the hospital. The Division is still searching for a replacement. The wait times for a clinical appointment have increased from 7 months to almost 10 months. - The Division has also presented Dr. Lee Brown with a business plan setting out the pros and co ns of adding a second mid -level and attending to the Division. At best the 253 Division would lose $20,000.00 on the hiring of these individuals at worst, the loss would be $70,000.00. Financial support from the hospital has been solicited. - The rheumatolog y portion (RAP, Rheumatology Access Program) of the ECHO project continues to grow with an expansion of cooperative sites to 12. - Accordingly, the specific goals are as follows: o Education: - To continue to expand the state -wide RAP program. - To continue to see k funding for the Endowed Chair. o Research: - Continue to expand our external support for the research activities of the Division. Dr. Wilmer Sibbitt was a Co -PI on an NIH RO1 research grant to study the effects of inflammation (lupus) on the heart. The PI was Dr. Carlos Roldan. Dr. Bankhurst continues his clinical research on RA with 2 pharmaceutical companies. o Clinical/Service: - The staff is poised to respond promptly to the clinical needs of managed care systems in the milieu of change in the health d elivery system. - Dr. Bankhurst has initiated a telemedicine clinic with First Choice, Bernalillo County's low cost health care provider. This model of subspecialty service can potentially be extended to rural areas throughout the state. C. APPOINTMENTS T O FACULTY/STAFF Jaya Sheela Amaram has joined the division as a Clinic Coordinator. Ms. Amaram will be with the division on a term basis and is assisting the division with making improvement to clinical billing and scheduling. Clyde Sanchez, NP left the division for a higher paying position with the State of New Mexico. D. OUTSIDE SPONSORED RESEARCH - Arthur D.
