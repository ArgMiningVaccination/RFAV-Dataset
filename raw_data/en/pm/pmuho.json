If the body was a village, your bloodstream would be its 'river of life'. Your blood is responsible for delivering oxygen and nutrients throughout the body to the cells. When targeted nutrients and other natural substances are introduced into the blood by trained professionals during IV therapy, your body can function better. You're actually improving the body's natural metabolic function and detoxification systems, improving your energy levels and even treating chronic disease. You perform better in exercise and you recover from illnesses quicker. So...what's the best way to get those all-important nutrients where they need to be? The best method is IV Therapy, i.e. intravenous therapy. Can't I just take a pill? Many people count on pills (oral supplements) to increase their nutrient intake, and it does provide some benefits, but it can't compare to the quick and efficient power of IV treatments. IV therapy puts the nutrients or therapeutic substances directly where they can do the most good and can achieve much higher blood concentrations of the nutrients. Also, some nutrients, such as glutathione, are not easily absorbed by mouth. What are the benefits? IV therapy is a powerful form of treatment for a variety of conditions, from muscle spasms to migraines. It's being used to effectively treat fibromyalgia, anxiety, arrhythmias, atherosclerosis and multiple sclerosis. People suffering from upper respiratory infections and other infections also benefit from IV therapy. There are specific IV treatments designed to reduce cravings and withdrawal symptoms for various addictions. It's used to treat macular degeneration, liver inflammation, fluoroquinolone toxicity and numerous other symptoms and conditions. And of course in gastrointestinal disorders, when there is deficient nutrient absorption, IV therapy is key to replenish much-needed nutrients. Cancer Treatment Aggressive cancer treatment, i.e. chemotherapy, while potentially beneficial, has numerous side-effects that can affect both health and quality of life. It is not uncommon that the toxic effects of chemotherapy are so severe that they are life-threatening, thus requiring patients to stop the therapy. Using IV therapy to administer high doses of Vitamin C has been shown to reduce this toxicity, decreasing infections, bone marrow toxicity, liver and pancreatic toxicity, gastrointestinal toxicity, and dermatological toxicity. This may, therefore, allow patients to continue with their needed chemotherapy. In addition, high dose vitamin C has been shown to be synergistic with radiation therapy and with many types of chemotherapy, improving the cancer-killing effects. Finally, high-dose vitamin C has also been shown to have an anticancer effect on its own, causing the death of cancer cells and slowing tumor growth. The blood concentration of vitamin C attained via IV therapy is much higher than that attained via oral vitamin C. So high, in fact, that IV vitamin C acts as an oxidant, not an antioxidant. This oxidative function is selectively lethal to many cancer cells, but not to the healthy cells of the body. IV glutathione treatments help reduce and repair the neuropathy from radiation and chemotherapy. Rehydration Athletes often use IV therapy before an event to improve performance, and they may use an after-competition rehydration and nutrient regimen to hasten recovery and provide vital nutrients to depleted cells. I provide a comprehensive IV therapy menu to help support immune function, improve energy, treat a variety of illnesses and reduce symptoms, as well as naturally calm the nervous system, decrease muscle inflammation, treat addiction and so much more.
