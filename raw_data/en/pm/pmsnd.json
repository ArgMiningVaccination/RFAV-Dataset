And while Western culture certainly is influenced by seasonal aspects, TCM goes much deeper. At the heart of Traditional Chinese Medicine lies the Five Element cycle which symbolizes the continuity and stages of life. Each season, and its corresponding element, represents a stage of development. Spring, aligned with the Wood element, is the first in the cycle and signifies creation - birth, life and its subsequent evolution. The rest we took in the winter allows us the energy to build and rebuild again. The energy that hibernated and germinated during those cold, dark days can now take shape. And as the amount of daylight increases, so too does the active and outward Yang energy, which will reach its pinnacle in the summer. For some, this increase in rising Yang energy can be overwhelming. Take stock and pace yourself accordingly, it's okay to take it slow. Consider this a time for a fresh start, like a breath of fresh air. To get things flowing break out, get some sun, loosen up, and move. Speaking of fresh air and movement, the climate associated with spring is Wind. As an \"agent of change,\" Wind is known to bring new ideas and rearrange old ones. Let it. A Season of Creating and Creativity One of the most amazing aspects of humanity is our creativity. It's the [driving force of our evolution](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/culture/article/creative-spark-augustin-fuentes-evolution). Spring's Wood energy relates to the building, brainstorming and planning of any creative idea. This energy also represents the action aspect of bringing an idea to life (with winter's Water element as the source of ideation). This planning adds the necessary substance, direction, and spark to any creative endeavor. Questions to consider: What ideas have lain dormant over the last few months? Where can I direct my creative energy? What do I need to do in order to see my vision come to fruition? A Season of Emotional Release Spring can be one of the best times of the year to move through personal and emotional challenges. This is because the season is ruled by the Liver and Gallbladder. The Liver is responsible for the smooth flow of blood and emotions throughout the body. It's also known to be most affected by stagnant emotions and stress. On the other hand, the Gallbladder is responsible for storing and excreting bile (what to keep vs. what to let go of) and governs decision-making, planning, dreaming, inspiration, and assertiveness. Combined, these organs can influence an emotional release and breakthrough, which perhaps many of us are needing as we process the days behind us and the days ahead. Tend to your liver and gallbladder by being mindful of what you're eating. Consider this time a bit of a detox: eat fresh greens, drink lots of water, stay away from caffeine and alcohol, etc. Also, the gallbladder loves to move. Take walks outside or bend like a tree in the wind with [3 movements your Gallbladder will love](https://mendacupuncture.com/movement-your-gallbladder-will-love). Adding a bit of activity will help to stir up stagnation, allowing you to work through emotions that may have been suppressed or unexpressed. Put a \"Spring\" Back in Your Step The spring season makes it possible to shed what no longer serves and to find more joy and lightness in life. Consider some of the following: - With warmer and more temperate weather, try to get outdoors as much as possible. - Increase movement with walking, dancing, qigong, yoga, etc. - Get in the dirt and start a flower, herb or vegetable garden. - Catch up with an old friend. - Do some spring cleaning around the house (even just a room or drawer). - Try something new or be a bit spontaneous. - Forgive as much and as often as you can. - Walk barefoot to help feel grounded and reconnected with the season. - Schedule an acupuncture session to get things moving in the right direction. It's also okay to expect a bit less of ourselves than in previous spring \"energy surges.\" While we may be leaving the \"emergency state\" of things, we must honor that we are not yet even post-trauma. Our bodies may feel depleted and easily overwhelmed or agitated for some time. Be easy on yourself and trust yourself to know what you need and crave with each new season ahead.
