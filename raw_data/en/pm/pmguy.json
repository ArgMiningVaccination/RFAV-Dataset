They are designed to provide information and assist decision -making. They are not intended to define a standard of care and should not be construed as one. Neither should they be interpreted as prescribing an exclusive course of management. This Clinical Practice Guideline is based on a systematic review of both clinical and epidemiological evidence. Developed by a panel of multidisciplinary experts, it provides a clear explanation of the lo gical relationships between various care options and health outcomes while rating both the quality of the evidence and the strength of the recommendations. Variations in practice will inevitably and appropriately occur when clinicians take into account the needs of individual patients, available resources, and limitations unique to an institution or type of practice. Every healthcare professional making use of these guidelines is responsible for evaluating the appropriateness of applying them in the setting of any particular clinical situation. These guidelines are not intended to represent Department of Veterans Affairs or TRICARE policy. Further, inclusion of recommendations for specific testing and/or therapeutic interventions within these guidelines doe s not guarantee coverage of civilian sector care.

Introduction The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and Department of Defense (DoD) Evidence -Based Practice Wor k Group (EBPWG) was established and first chartered in 2004, with a mission to advise the \"...Health Executive Council on the use of clinical and epidemiological evidence to improve the health of the population across the Vete rans Health Administration and M ilitary Health System,\" by facilitating the development of clinical practice guidelines for the VA and DoD populations. [1] This clinical practice guideline (CPG) is intended to provide healthcare providers with a framework by which to evaluate, treat, and manage the individual needs and preferences of patients with diabetes mellitus (DM), thereby leading to improved clinical outcomes. The first VA/DoD CPG for the Management of Diabetes Mellitus, based upon earlier iterations in 1997 and 2000, was published in 2003. [2 ] It established a risk stratification approach for setting individualized target goals based upon life expectancy, comorbid conditions, patient preferences, and abs olute benefits and potential risks of therapy. [2] It also emphasized the r isks of hypoglycemia. In 2010 , the VA and DoD published a CPG for the Management of Diabetes Mellitus (2010 DM CPG), which was based on evidence reviewed through June 2009 . Since the release of that guideline, a growing body of research has expanded the general knowledge and understanding of DM. Follow -up of major clinical trials of intensive therapy, as well as advances in physiological, behavioral, nutritional, and pharmacological research have led to the emergence of new strategies to manage and treat pa tients with DM. Consequently, a recommendation to update the 2010 DM CPG was made and the update to the 2010 DM CPG was initiated in 2015 . The updated CPG includes evidence -based recommendations and additional information on the management of DM. It is int ended to assist healthcare providers in all aspects of patient care , including diagnosis, treatment, and follow -up. The system -wide goal of evidence -based guidelines is to improve the patient's health and well -being by guiding health providers , especially in primary care, to the management pathways that are supported by evidence. The expected outcome of successful implementation of this guideline is to: Emphasize shared decision -making to establish patient goals Assess the patient's situation and determine , in collaboration with the patient , the treatmen t m ethods to achieve the goals. Reduce the risk of preventable complications while improving quality of life (QoL). II. Backgroun d A. Description of Diabetes Mellitus Diabetes mellitus is a disease caused by an absolute or relative insulin deficiency resulting in hyperglycemia. Type 1 DM (T1DM) is due to insulin secretion deficiency not resulting from insulin resistance, while type 2 DM (T2DM) is due to insulin resistance that can eventually also result in insulin secretion deficiency. The insulin resistance resulting in T2DM is thought to be due to excess adiposity, especially central distribution of adiposity, but can be due to other factors, such as corticosteroid treatment or Cushing's syndrome. Gestational di abetes (GDM) is DM present during pregnancy. Other more unusual types of DM also exist, such as maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY), latent VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in Primary Care April 2017 Page 6 of 160 autoimmune d iabetes o f adult ( LADA) and t hose r elated t o pancreatic d isease o r acromegaly, but the current g uideline is f ocused o n T2DM.

In the absence of unequivocal hyperglycemia with acute metabolic decompensation, one of these two tests should be done on different days. 3 Using a clinical laboratory (not a p oint-of-care) methodology standardized to the National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program (NGSP) An oral glucose tolerance testing (OGTT ) is most commonly done to diagnose gestational diabetes . VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in Primary Care April 2017 Page 7 of 160 Patients with one or more of the following risk factors are at higher risk for T2DM: Age 45 years Family history (first -degree relative with DM) Member of a high -prevalence population (e.g., African American, Hispanic American, Native American, Asian American, Pacific Islander) Prediabetes (HbA1c 5.7% [39 [7], or IF G on previous testing)1 H ypertension (blood pressure 140/90 mmHg or on therapy for hypertension )1 Hi gh-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL -C) level < 35 mg/dL a level > mmol/L)1 H istory of cardiovascular disease (CVD)1 O verweight (body mass index [BMI] 25 kg/m2 or 23 kg/m2 in Asian Americans )1 A bdominal obesity1 W omen polycystic ovar y syndrome (PCOS)1 H istory of GDM or history of delivering babies weighing > 9 lbs (about 4 kg) Other clinical conditions associated with insulin resistance (e.g. , severe obesity, acanthosis nigricans) Physical inactivity /sedentary lifestyle Patients using antipsychotics or statins B. Epidemiol ogy and Impact The prevalence of diabetes is increasing around the world, mostly due to the increase in obesity and sedentary lifestyles.[ 8] The number of Americans with diagnosed DM has increased four-fold between 1980 and 2014. [9] In the United States (U.S.) , a total of 29.1 million people, or 9.3% of the population, have DM (type 1 or type 2), of which 21 million are diagnosed and 8.1 million are undiagnosed. [10] In the military population enrolled in the Military Health System (MHS), the prevalence of diagnosed DM ranged from 7.3% to 11.2% in 2006 and from 8.3% to 1 3.6% in 2010.[ 11] Although the p revalence among Active Duty Service Members remained stable, a significant increase was observed over time among Non -Active Duty Serv ice Members. [11] In 2010, the prevalence among Non -Active m ilitary men and women were 15.0% and 13.3% respectively for those aged 45 -64 years, 32.9% and 26.9% respec tively for those aged 65 -74 years, and 31.5% and 25.7% respectively for those aged 75 years and older. [11] According to the Veterans Health Administration (VHA), nearly one in four Veterans (1.6 million individuals) who are receiving care from the VA has DM. Veterans 65 years and older comprise 70% of those with diabetes, reflecting the older age distribution of this population. [12] 1 Associated with insulin resistance VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in Primary Care April 2017 Page 8 of 160 DM can cause microvascular complications such as retinopathy, nephropathy , and neuropathy as well as macrovascular complicati ons, including heart disease, stroke , and peripheral vascular disease.[ 13] In addition to the complications of T2DM, conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD ), substance use disorder (SUD), and depression can affect the management of DM . For guidance on how to addr ess those comorbidities, s ee the respective VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline s for the Management of COPD, SUD an d Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) .2,3,4 DM is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the U.S. It is associated with a two -fold to four -fold increased risk for atherosclerotic CVD , resulting in substantial morbidity and mortality from coronary events. For the management of CVD risk factors, refer to the VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline s for the Management of Hypertension, Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD ), and Dyslipidemia.5,6,7 The total costs of diagnosed DM in the U.S. were $245 billion in 2012, including $176 billion for direct medical costs and $69 billion in reduced productivity. [14] Direct costs in the VHA and MHS are not known. III. About this Clinical Practice Guideline This guideline represents a significant step toward improving the treatment and management of patients with DM in the VA and DoD . As with other CPGs , however, challenges remain, including evidence gaps, the need to develop effective strategies for guideline implementation and to evaluate the effect of guideline adherence on clinical outcomes. This guideline is inte nded for VA and DoD healthcare practitioners including physicians, nurse practitioners, nurses, physician assistants, dietitians/ nutritionists, diabetes educators, pharmacists, and others involved in the care of Service Members or Veterans with DM. As elab orated in the qualifying statement on page one, this CPG is not intended to serve as a standard of care. Standards of care are determined on the basis of all clinical data available for an individual patient and are subject to change as scientific knowledg e and technology advance and patterns evolve. This CPG is based on information available by March 2016 and is intended to provide a general guide to best practices. The guideline can assist care providers, but the use of a CPG must always be considered as a recommendation, within the context of a provider's clinical judgment and patient values and preferences, for the care of an individual patient.

This document provides information regarding the process of developing guidelines, including the identi fication and assembly of the Guideline Champions (Champions) , and other subject matter experts from within the VA and DoD, known as the Work Group, and ultimately, the development and submission of a new or updated DM CPG. The Champions and Work Group for this CPG were charged with developing evidence- based clinical practice recommendations and writing and publishing a guideline document to be used by providers within the VA/DoD healthcare systems. Specifically, the Champions and Work Group members for this guideline were responsible for identifying the key questions (KQs) of the most clinical relevance, importance, and interest for the management of patients with DM . The Champions and the Work Group also provided direction on inclusion and exclusion criteria for the evidence review and assessed the level and quality of the evidence. The amount of new scientific evidence that had accumulated since the previous version of the CPG was also taken into consideration in the identification of the KQs. In addition, the Champions assisted in: Identifying appropriate disciplines of individuals to be included as part of the Work Group Directing and coordinating the Work Group Participating throughout the guideline development and review processes The VA Office of Quality, Safety and Value, in collaboration with the Office of Evidence Based Practice, U.S. Army Medical Command, the proponent for CPGs for the DoD, identified two clinical leaders as Champions for the 201 7 DM CPG. Leonard Pogach, MD, MBA is the C hampion from the VA and Maj Jeffrey A. Colburn, MD i s the Champion for the DoD. Maj Colburn replaced the previous DoD C hampion who left the Work Group after the in- person Work Group meeting in June 2016 due to a conflict of interest (COI). The Lewin Team, including the Lewin Group, Duty First Consulting, ECRI Institute, and Sigma Health Consulting, LLC, was contracted by the VA and DoD to support the development of this CPG and conduct the evidence review. The first conference call was held in December 2015, with participation from the contracting officer's repres entative, leaders from the VA Office of Quality, Safety and Value and the DoD Office of Evidence Based Practice, and the Champions. During this call, participants discussed the scope of the guideline initiative , the roles and responsibilities of the Champions, the project timeline, and the approach for developing and prioritizing specific research questions on which to base a systematic review (SR) about the management of DM . The group also identified a list of clinical specialties and areas of expertise that are important and relevant to the management of DM, from which Work Group members were recruited. The specialties and clinical areas of interest included endocrinology , internal medicine, nutrition, pharmacy , health education, nursing, medical management, ambulatory care , and family practice. The guideline development process for the 201 7 CPG update consisted of the following steps: 1.Formulating and prioritizing KQs 2.Conducting a patient f ocus group 3.Conducting the SRVA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in Primary Care April 2017 Page 10 of 160 4. Convening a face -to-face meeting with the Champions and Work Group members 5. Drafting and submitting a final CPG about the management of DM to the VA/DoD EBPWG Appendix A provides a detailed des cription of each of these tasks. a. Grading Recommendations The Champions and Work Group used the Grading of Recommendations Assessme nt, Development and Evaluation ( GRADE ) system to assess the quality of the evidence base and assign a grade for the strength for each recommendation. The GRADE system uses the following four domains to assess the strength of each recommendation: [15] Confidence in the quality of the evi dence Balance of desirable and undesirable outcomes Patient or provider v alues and preferences Othe r implications, as appropriate, e.g.,: Resource u se Equity Acceptability Feasibility Subgroup considerations Using this system, the Champions and Work Grou p determined the relative strength of each recommendation (Strong or Weak). A strong recommendation indicates that the Work Group is highly confident that desirable outcomes outweigh undesirable outcomes. If the Work Group is less confident of the balance between desirable and undesirable outcomes, they give a weak recommendation. They also determined the direction of each recommendation (For or Against). Similarly, a recommendation for a therapy or preventive measure indicates that the desirable consequen ces outweigh the undesirable consequences. A recommendation against a therapy or preventive measure indicates that the undesirable consequences outweigh the desirable consequences. Using these elements, the grade of each recommendation is presented as part of a continuum: Strong For (or \"We recommend offering this option ...\") Weak For (or \"We suggest offering this option ...\") Weak Against (or \"We suggest not offering this option ...\") Strong Against (or \"We recommend against offering this option ...\") The grade o f each recommendation made in the 201 7 DM CPG can be found in the section on Recommendations . Additional information regarding the use of the GRADE system can be found in Appendix A . VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in Primary Care April 2017 Page 11 of 160 It is important to note that the GRADE system grades the strength of recommendations based on four domains \u2014(1) confidence in the quality of evidence ; (2) balance of benefits and harms ; (3) patient values and preferences ; and (4) other con siderations, which can include resource use, equity and acceptability. Most other grading systems, such as U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), use only two domains \u2014(1) certainty of net benefit and (2) magnitude of net benefit (i.e., balance of benefits and harms). Thus, differences in recommendations across guidelines may reflect differences in the grading system used as well as differences in the evidence reviewed and/or how the strength of the evidence is evaluated by the Work Group. b. Reconciling 2010 Clinical Practice Guideline Recommendations Evidence -based CPGs should be current, which typically requires revisions of previous guidelines based on new evidence, or as scheduled, subject to time -based expirations. [16] For example, the USPSTF has a process for refining or otherwise updating its recommendations pertaining to preventive se rvices. [17] Further, the inclusion criteria for the National Guideline Clearinghouse specify that a guideline must have be en developed, reviewed, or revised within the past five years. The DM Guideline Work Group focused largely on developing new and updated recommendations based on the evidence review conducted for the priority areas addressed by the KQs. In addition to those new and updated recommendations, the Guideline Work Group considered, without complete review of the relevant evidence, the current applicability of other recommendations that were included in the previous 2010 DM CPG, subject to evolving practice in to day's environment. A set of recommendation categories was adapted from those used by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). [18,19] These categories, along with their corresponding definitions, were used to account for the various ways in which previous recommendations could have been updated. In brief, the categories took in to account whether or not the evidence that related to a recommendation was systematically reviewed, the degree to which the recommendation was modified, and the degree to which a recommendation is relevant in the current patient care environment and withi n the scope of the CPG. Additional information regarding these categories and their definitions can be found in Appendix A . The categories for the reco mmendations included in the 201 7 version of the g uideline can be found in the section on Recommendations . The categories for the recommendations from the 2010 DM CPG are noted in Appendix F. The CPG Work Group recognized the need to accommod ate the transition in evidence -rating systems from the 2010 DM CPG to the current CPG. In order to report the strength of all recommendations using a consistent format (i.e., the GRADE system ), the CPG Work Group converted the USPSTF strengths of the recom mendation accompanying the carryov er recommendations from the 2010 guideline to the GRADE system. As such, the CPG Work Group considered the strength of the evidence cited for each recommendation in the 2010 DM CPG as well as harms and benefits, values and preferences, and other implications, where possible. The CPG Work Group referred to the available evidence as summarized in the body of the 2010 DM CPG and did not re -assess the evidence systematically . In some instances, peer -reviewed literature publishe d since the 2010 DM CPG was considered along with the evidence base used for that CPG. VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in Primary Care April 2017 Page 12 of 160 Where such newer literature was considered when converting the strength of the recommendation from the USPSTF to the GRADE system, it is referenced in the discussion tha t follows the corresponding recommendation, as well as in Appendix E. The CPG Work Group recognizes that, while there are practical reasons for incorporating findings from a previous SR, previous recommendations, [20 ] or recent peer -reviewed publications into an updated CPG, doing so does not involve an original, comprehensive SR and, therefore, may introduce bias. c. Peer Review Process The CPG was developed through an iterative process in which the Work Group produced multiple drafts of the CPG. The process for developing the initial draft is described in more detail in Drafting and Submitting the Final Clinical Practice Guideline . Once a near- final draft of th e guideline was agreed upon by the Champions and Work Group members, the draft was sent out for peer review and comment. The draft was posted on a wiki website for a period of 14 business days. The peer reviewers comprised individuals working within the VA and DoD health systems as well as experts from relevant outside organizations designated by the Work Group members. External organizations that participate d in the peer review included the following: Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, U.S. Food and Drug Administration (F DA) Coverage and Analysis Group, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Geisel School of Medicine , Dartmouth College Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) National Institute o n Aging, National Institutes of Health (NIH) Office of Rural Health Policy, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) The VA and DoD Leadership reached out to both the internal and external peer reviewers to solicit their feedback on the CPG. Revi ewers were provided a hyperlink to the wiki website where the draft CPG was posted. For transparency, a ll reviewer feedback was posted in tabular form on the wiki site, alon g with the name of the reviewer . All feedback from the peer reviewers was discussed and considered by the Work Group. Modifications made throughout the CPG development process were made in accordance with the evidence. B. Summary of Patient Focus Group Methods and Findings When forming guideline recommendations, consideration should be give n to the values of those most affected by the recommendatio ns. Patients bring perspectives, values , and preferences into their health care experience, and more specifically their DM care experience, that vary from those of clinicians. These differences and the variability between patients ' perspectives can affect decision making in various situations, and should thus be highlighted and made explicit due to their potential to influence a recommendation's implementation. [21,22] Focus groups can be used as an effici ent method to explore ideas and perspectives of a group of individuals with an a priori set of assumptions or hypotheses and collect qualitative data on a thoughtfully predetermined set of questions. VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in Primary Care April 2017 Page 13 of 160 Therefore, as part of the effort to update this CPG, VA and DoD Leadership, al ong with the DM CPG Work Group and Lewin , held a patient focus group on March 8, 2016, at the VA Puget Sound Health Care System - American Lake Division in Tacoma, Washington . The aim of the focus group was to further the understandi ng of the perspective of patients receiving treatment for DM within the VA and/or DoD health care systems. The focus group explored patient perspectives on a set of topics related to management of DM in the VA and DoD healthcare systems, including patients' knowledge of DM treatment options, views on the delivery of care, patients' perspective on their needs and preferences, and the impact of DM on the ir lives . It is important to note the focus group was a convenience sample and the Working Group recognizes the limitations inherent in the small sample size. Less than 10 people were included in the focus group consistent with the requirements of the federal Paperwork Reduction Act, 1980. The Work Group acknowledges that the sample of patients included in this focus group may not be representative of all VA and DoD patients receiving treatment for DM. Patient perspective and input provided , while invaluable , is not generalizable given the broad characteristics of various key demographic groups of persons with DM. Further, time limitations for the focus group prevented exhaustive exploration of all topics related to DM treatment in the VA and DoD and the patients' broader experiences with their care. Thus, the Working Group made decisions regarding the priority of topics to discuss at the focus group. These limitations, as well as others, were considered throughout the use of the information collected from the discussion for guideline development. Recruitment for participation in the focus group was managed by the Champions and VA and DoD Leadership, with assistance from coordinators at the facility at which the focus group took place. The following concepts are aspects of care that are important to patients that emerged from the discussion. These concepts were n eeded and important parts of the participants' care and added to the Work Group's understanding of patient values and perspectives. Additional details regarding the patient focus group methods and findings can be found in Append ix D . DM CPG Patient Focus Group Concepts A. Using shared decision -making, consider al l treatment options and develop a treatment plan based on the balance of risks, benefits, and patient -specific goals, values, and preferences. B. Guide patients on the self -management of their DM and glucose monitoring, including benefits and risks, and their expectations. C. Educate and involve family caregivers and co -workers in accordance with patient preferences regarding core knowledge of DM management. D. Within and between VA and DoD healthcare systems, work with appropriate providers to ensure continuity of high -quality care and timely referral to an endocrinologist. E. Create a support system for patients with DM such as online groups, chats, other support groups, and diabe tes education classes to enhance involvement and support among patients with DM. C. Conflict of Interest At the start of this guideline development process and at other key points throughout, the project team was required to submit disclosure statements to reveal any areas of potential COI in the past 24 months. Verbal affirmations of no COI were used as necessary during meetings throughout the guideline VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in Primary Care April 2017 Page 14 of 160 development process. The project team was also subject to random web -based surveillance (e.g., ProPublica) . If a project team member reported a COI (actual or potential), measures were in place to mitigate the introduction of bias into the guideline development process. Identified COIs would be reported to the Office of Evidence Based Practice and disclosed t o the EBPWG in tandem with their review of the evidence and development of recommendations. The EBPWG and the DM CPG Work Group would then determine whether or not action, such as restricting participation and/or voting on sections related to the conflict or removal from the Work Group, was necessary. If deemed necessary, action to mitigate the COI was taken by the Champions and Office of Evidence Based Practice, based on the level and extent of involvement. In order to mitigate the risk of bias while maxi mizing the contributions of those with expertise in a specific area of DM, the Champions asked Work Group members to disclose relevant relationships during related guideline development discussions. Members with potential COIs contributed to the discussion s related to their particular areas of expertise as well as the overarching guideline document in order to ensure differing viewpoints and experienc es were adequately represented. The initially appointed DoD Champion disclosed a COI at the in -person meetin g and VA and DoD Leadership determined the COI would preclude him from continuing his role on the DM CPG Work Group. Maj Jeffrey A. Colburn , already a DM CPG Work Group member, was selected as the new DoD Champion. The work on the guideline when the initia l DoD Champion was present was reviewed and steps were taken to ensure that no biases were introduced and that the initial work on the DM CPG with the former DoD Champion did not negatively affect the objectivity of the DM CPG development. D. Scope of this C linical Practice Guideline Regardless of setting, any patient in the VA/DoD healthcare system s should be offered access to the interventions that are recommended in this guideline after taking into consideration the patient's specific circumstances. This CPG is designed to assist providers in managing or co -managing patients with T2 DM. Moreover, the patient population of interest for this CPG is adults who are eligible for care in the VA and DoD healthcare delivery systems , which includes Veterans , deploye d and non -deployed Active Duty Service Members , and their adult family members , and retirees and their beneficiaries or dependents . This CPG does not provide recommendations for the management of DM in children , adolescents , or pregnant/nursing women . The literature review encompassed interventional studies (primarily randomized controlled trials [RCTs]) and observational studies published between January 2009 and March 2016, and targeted nine KQs focusing on the means by which the delivery of healthcare c ould be optimized for patients with DM. KQ7 required updated searches through June 14, 2016. The selected KQs were prioritized from many possible KQs. Due to resource constraints, a review of the evidence in all important aspects of care for patients with DM was not feasible for the update of this CPG. For example, treatments specific to obese patients, such as bariatric surgery, are not addressed in this CPG but are addressed in the VA/DoD VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in Primary Care April 2017 Page 15 of 160 Clinical Practice Guideline for Screening and Management of Overwe ight and Obesity (VA/DoD Obesity CPG).8 E. Highlighted Features of this Clinical Practice Guideline The 201 7 edition of the VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in Primary Care is the fourth update to the original CPG. It provides practice recommendations for the care of patients with DM. A particular strength of this CPG is the multidisciplinary stakeholder involvement from its inception, ensuring representation from the broad spectrum of clinicians engaged in the treatment and management of patients with DM. The framework for recommendations in this CPG considered factors beyond the strength of the evidence, including balancing desired outcomes with potential harms of treatment , the potential for variation in patient values and preferences , and other considerations such as resource use and equity . Applicability of the evidence to VA/DoD populations was also taken into consideration. A structured algorithm accompanies the guideline to provide an overview of the reco mmendations in the context of the flow of patient care and clinician decision making and to assist with training providers. The algorithm may be used to help facilitate translation of guideline recommendations into effective practice. F. Shared Decision -makin g and Patient -centered Care Throughout this VA/DoD CPG, the authors encourage clinici ans to focus on shared decision -making (SDM). The SDM model was introduced in Crossing the Quality Chasm, an Institute of Medicine (now the National Academy of Medicine) report, in 2001. [23] It is readily apparent that patients with DM, together with their clinicians, make decisions regarding their plan of care and target glycemic range ; however, these patients requi re sufficient information to be able to make informed decisions. Clinicians must be skilled at presenting their patients with understandable and actionable information regarding both individual treatments and levels and locations of care . Therefore, the VA /DoD CPG recommendations are intended to promote SDM and be patient -centered. VA/DoD CPGs encourage clinicians to use SDM to individualize treatment goals and plans based on patient capabilities, needs, goals, prior treatment experience , and preferences. G ood communication between healthcare professionals and the patient is essential and should be supported by evidence - based information tailored to the patient's needs. Use of an empathetic and non -judgmental (versus a confrontational) approach facilitates d iscussions sensitive to gender, culture, and ethnic differences. The information that patients are given about treatment and care should be culturally appropriate and also available to people with limited literacy skills. It should also be accessible to people with additional needs such as physical, sensory, or learning disabilities. Family involvement shou ld be considered if appropriate, especially in elderly patients. [24] When properly executed, SDM [25,26 ] may decrease patient anxiety, increase trust in clinicians, [27] and improve treatment adherence. [28] Improved patient -clinician communication can be used to convey openness to discuss any future concerns. As part of the patient -centered care approach, clinicians should review the outcomes of previous self - change efforts, past treatment experiences, and outcomes (including reasons for treatment drop -out) 8 See the VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for Screening and Management of Overweight and Obesity.

Lastly, they should inv olve the patient in prioritizing problems to be addressed and in setting specific goals regardless of the selected setting or level of care. G. Implementation This CPG and algorithm are designed to be adapted by individual healthcare providers with considerat ion of local needs and resources. The algorithm serve s as a tool to prompt providers to consider key decision points in the course of an episode of care. Although this CPG represents the recommended practice on the date of its publication, medical practic e is evolving and this evolution requires continuous updating based on published information. New technology and more research will improve patient care in the future. The CPG can assist in identifying priority areas for research and to inform optimal allo cation of resources. Future studies examining the results of CPG implementation may lead to the development of new evidence particularly relevant to clinical practice.

Algorithm This CPG includes an algorithm which is designed to facilitate understanding of the clinical pathway and decision -making process used in mana gement of DM. The use of the algorithm format as a way to represent patient management was chosen based on the understanding that such a format may promote more efficient diagnostic and therapeutic decision making and has the potential to change patterns o f resource use. Recognizing that some clinical care processes are non -linear, the algorithm format allows the provider to follow a simplified linear approach in assessing the critical information needed at the major decision points in the clinical process, and includes: An ordered sequence of steps of care Relevant observations and examinations Decisions for consider ation Actions to be taken A clinical algorithm diagrams a guideline into a step -by-step decision tree. Standardized symbols are used to display each step in the algorithm and arrows connect the numbered boxes indicating the order in which the steps should be f ollowed.

General Approach to T2DM Care Recommendation 1. We recommend shared decision -making to enhance patient knowledge and satisfaction. (Strong for | Reviewed, New -added) Discussion SDM is the process by which the patient and family in conjunction with the prov ider of care come to an agreement about a plan of care and treatment. Key principles include the patient/family readiness, provision of benefits and harms of all options in understandable tools, and incorporation of preferences. [25,26] SDM includes eight steps: 1) Ask - identify Issues; 2) Prioritize - explore what the patient wants; 3) Assess - look for barriers to the SDM; 4) Advise - benefits, risks of patient choice; 5) Acknowledge - criteria of the basis for the decision; 6) Assist - explore the options; 7) Make the decision; and 8) Evaluate - how did the choice work? Be prepared to review and revisit as needed. Is the patient satisfied with the outcome? [25] Confidence in the quality of evidence was high regarding SDM for improving patient s' knowledge, satisfaction and engagement with their treatment plan. [30-32] A prescribed type of approach to SDM is not well defined in the literature for individual patient groups and represents a research gap in this area. Patient preference must be a consideration. However, the studies utilized for this recommendation noted pa tients may have varying responses to their clinical providers when approached to engage in SDM processes. Patients that are diagnosed with DM may respond differently to SDM depending on personal goals, life experiences, and coping strategies. [ 30-32] SDM should not be used just for a patient with stable glycemic controls ; it should be used to assist those patients that may not be able or willing to make those lifestyle changes and decisions that affect their health condition at any time duri ng the course of their disease. This should include, at a minimum, diagnosis, difficulties in management, and times of transition or development of complications. [32] Shared understanding is critical to the SDM process. Health coaching and motivational interviewing strategies can assist clinicians to understand patients' perceptions, values and beliefs regarding their condition, treatment and self -management options, particularly when patients appear to be reluctant to fully participate in decisions and care. Studies indicate there may be other approaches that use health coaching and motivati onal interviewing approaches to promote medication compliance /adherence and follow through. Using motivational interviewing techniques can make it easier to understand the specific level of patients' perception of the disease process and their comfort level discussing this process. Motivational interviewing is one of the techniques that may be used in the process of SDM. It provides a communication skill which may be lacking in some patient arenas. When a provider uses motivational interviewing skills it ma y increase the dialogue between provider and patient thus developing a trust level more rapidly and more effectively. Sharing healthcare decisions requires a healthcare system which supports the process, and patients, providers, and healthcare team members who are encouraged to share decisions. The benefits of SDM usually outweigh the harms with increase in patient satisfaction and treatment \"buy -in\" regarding the ways and methods to reach that particular goal or treatment plan. [30 ] When patient preferences are considered, it reinforces a trusted therapeutic relationship and creates \"good -will\" as a shared responsibility for patient health outcomes. VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in Primary Care April 2017 Page 24 of 160 SDM may be time intensive as the provider has to create an environment of consideration and goal formation. Clinical training in these communication skills may be a win as research indicates that patients most likely to participate in this SDM process are comfortable speaking with their providers and have some level of knowledge of their specific disease process. [33] Our challenge is to help patients understand how they can successfully manage DM and partner with their providers and healthcare teams to share their goals and preferences to individualize healthcare decision s. Providing system supports, SDM tools, and assuring that providers and teams can use patient -centered communication skills will increase patients' willingness to share decisions. These factors are the key to SDM. Recomm endation 2. We recommend that all patients with diabetes should be offered ongoing individualized diabetes self -management education via various modalities tailored to their preferences, learning needs and abilities based on available resources. (Strong for | Reviewed, New -replaced) Discussion Diabetes Self- Management Education (DSME) and Diabetes Self -Management Support (DSMS) provide a framework involving a collaborative, on -going, interactive process focusing on the patient with DM to gain knowledge, modify behavior, and successfully manage the disease. The process requires ongoing interactive information -sharing between the diabetes team and the patient. The goal of diabetes education in SDM is to ensure the patient has sufficient knowledge and skills to achieve the treatment goals they agreed upon with their healthcare provider. Participants in the patient focus group emphasized the importance of DSME and that understanding diabetes is important for self- manage ment of the disease. A strong message from the focus group was that clinicians need to account for the specific circumstances (e.g., cognitive impairment, changing life situations, culture/belief system) of each patient, have detailed knowledge about the various treatment options, and plan accordingly for each patient. The reviewed literature acknowledged the value of DSME -DSMS to facilitate patient management, improve patient outcomes, as well as reduce overall diabetes -related costs. DSME is differentiated from traditional education which is didactic and tends to be delivered in lecture format only. [34 ] DSME as described in the literature is a dynamic process that provides knowledge and self -management ski ll- building activities based on individual needs, attitudes, beliefs, and ever- changing life situations. [34,35] The content of DSME varied between studies, but the following topics were consistently covered during study interventions: knowledge about diabetes and treatment options, medications, nutrition, exercise, hypoglycemia, monitoring of glucose and HbA1c, psychosocial and behavioral components, risk reduction, foot care, smoking cessation, chronic complications, and sick day management. [ 35-39] DSME may be delivered vi a various modalities, including group sessions/discussion, telephone, web - based technology, multimedia presentations, teach -back, and role play. The reviewed literature addressed various modes of delivery and varied in the content of educational materials and time allotted for the intervention (varied from 1 to >20 hours), as well as the specific population subgroups that were studied. Due to wide variability in the evidence reviewed, the Work Group classified the VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in Primary Care April 2017 Page 25 of 160 confidence level for the quality of evidenc e as low. Most studies favored group DSME over usual care (individual visit with primary care provider). [34,36,40] When comparing different modalities of providing DSME, the evidence identified positive patient outcomes for DSME delivered in group settings, individual settings, or using technology -based sys tems (e.g., telephone, internet). [38,41,42] Pillay et al. concluded that the greater the time spent with the patient was associated with improved outcomes and there is a need to provide DSME, DSMS, and/or behavioral programs to assist with lifestyle change. [40] DSME -DSMS may be provided individually or in a group, based on available resources. Group -based DSME -DSMS is cost -effecti ve and provides foundational support for individuals with diabetes to meet and discuss common issues. [34,36 ] Individual education can be time and resource intensive, but should be considered especially for individuals with special needs (e.g., cognitive issues, hearing or sight impairment). While the evidence did not favor group over individual DSME, individua ls with poor glycemic management benefitted more from individual interventions than those with good glycemic management. [ 39] A combination of group and indi vidual DSME -DSMS may be effective in providing general information and developing personalized goals/treatment plans more efficiently. Success of DSME in the literature was dependent on program intensity and the delivery personnel or format. [34 ] DSME -DSMS was shown to require substantial contact time and a support component to train individuals in self- care skills. Tailoring DSME to ethnic minorities was shown to be beneficial. [35] Resources to provid e DSME will vary greatly and may be limited at some facilities due to inadequate staffing or lack of trained personnel. When DSME is not easily available, refer to the network based on your organization's policies. Other options may include community -based programs, web -based education, or phone applications. [43] This Work Group studied one SR ,[43] one network meta -analysis, [40] and three RCTs [37,38,44] in an effort to evaluate the effectiveness of tec hnology -based DSME programs to aid in guiding this recommendation. In the SR by Pal et al. , technology -based DSME was significantly more effective at six months ( -0.2%, 95% CI : -0.4 to - 0.1), however, the effect diminishe d over time and was shown to not b e significant beyond six months ( -0.1%, 95% CI : -0.3 to 0.1). [43] Patients who received technology -based DSME reported greater self- efficacy at six to 18 months rela tive to patients in the control group. Tang et al. assessed the effectiveness of internet- based DSME in a group of 415 patients with an average age of 54 years. [44] Internet -based DSME was associated with greater HbA1c reductions at six months (internet- based: Mean Difference [ MD] -1.32 ; usual care [ standard -of-care treatment with reminders for annual laboratory tests and screenings ]: MD - 0.66, p <0.001); however, at 12 months follow -up, these differences lost statistical significance (internet- based: MD - 1.14; usual care: MD - 0.95 , p=0.133). However, treatment satisfaction at 12 months was greatest in patients who received internet- based DSME relative to patients who received usual care (p <0.001). [44] In summary, the reviewed research demonstrated that internet- based DSME is comparable to the traditional in -person group DSME class for improvement in HbA1c outcomes. VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in Primary Care April 2017 Page 26 of 160 The individuals who participated in the patient focus group shared similar and intertwined goals and preferences, including maintaining their current work, minimizing treatment side effects, maintaining a functional life, and improving QoL. A key suggestion made by the focus group participants was to create a formal support system for patients with diabetes such as web -based , online chats, or other types of support groups and diabetes education classes to enhance inv olvement and support. Incorporation of online learning into the DSME model appears to allow expansion of options for individual learners with diabetes who may prefer an online program over an in -person group program. Online learning allows the learner to e ngage in topics of personal interest and reinforce concepts by repeating online classes during asynchronous, flexible times. It also allows learners, family members, and co -workers the ability to acquire needed information without taking time away from the ir work schedule. The literature supports using alternative delivery systems of DSME to provide support and maximize learning while presenting core curriculum. The goal of an internet -based strategy is not to replace group or individualized DSME programs b ut to allow adult learners the ability to flexibly engage and invest in their diabetes care needs. DSMS is a recent concept as of this CPG update, and not yet consistently defined or supported in the literature. Broadly defined, DSMS is the notion of ongoing support of the individual after receiving DSME. While the literature reviewed did not specifically address DSMS, programs that provided ongoing support (e.g., periodic follow -up, evaluating and re -establishing goals, support groups) showed better outcom es after the initial educational intervention than isolated educational events. [34-36 ] As stated, DSME is a dynamic, on -going process where educational needs will vary and fluctuate with changes to medication regimens, medical conditions, and life situations. [34,35] Positive patient outcomes, such as improved HbA1c levels, increases in physical activity, emotional stability, and decreased BMI typically peaked at three to six months; but without ongoing support programs in place, the benefits will likely decline. [ 40,43] This was further validated by the patient focus group who advocated for on -going support to enhance self -mana gement. The expectation, then, should be to use SDM to reassess patient treatment goals and educational needs. Ideally, this should be conducted at each visit and addressed accordingly using education resources available to the medical treatment facility. Evidence shows that self -management training is effective, but most reviews called for further research by way of well- designed and long- term studies. Computer -based diabetes self -management interventions have limited evidence supporting their use and mor e research is needed for design, delivery and effectiveness. There is also a need to identify effective modalities (e.g., internet, satellite) to provide education in areas where an educator is not available. Recommendation 3. We suggest offering one or more types of bidirectional telehealth interventions (typically health communication via computer, telephone or other electronic means) involving licensed independent practitioners to patients selected by their primary care provider as an adjunct to usual patie nt care. (Weak for | Reviewed, New -replaced) VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in Primary Care April 2017 Page 27 of 160 Discussion Available telehealth studies were limited and heterogeneous in design and outcome ; telehealth had a different meaning in each study. Moreover, most studies looked at telehealth as an adjunct to usual care . Tildesley et al. conducted a small study in which 46 patients were randomized to an internet- based glucose monitoring system (IBGMS) uploaded every two weeks to a secure, commercially available website plus conventional care with endocrinology or to convention al care with endocrinology only. [45] There was a statistically significant decrease in HbA1c for the IBGMS group (a djusted HbA1c difference - 1.3%) compared to the control grou p (adjusted HbA1c difference -0.1%) for up to six months of follow - up. However , patients were returned to conventional care after six months and the effect was not sustainable at the 12 -month mark. Luchsinger et al. , the only large study in the evidence base (N=2 ,169), evaluated registered nurse ( RN) case management telehealth versus usual care in patients age d 55 years. [46] The intervention included a home telemedicine unit with a web -enabled computer and modem connection to an existing telephone line. Patients i n the telehealth interven tion had statistically significant sustained reductions o f HbA1c over five years of follow -up, but the difference in HbA1c reduction was not clinically significant ( telemedicine: mean 7.09 \u00b1 0.06 95% CI: 0.12 to 0.46). Two other studies involved primary care providers utilizing telehealth. Holbrook et al. (N=511) evaluated a web -based diabetes tracker shared between patient s and their primary care providers .[47] There was a statistically significant improvement in HbA1c, but not in quality of life, in the intervention group compared to the control group. Wakefield et al. (N=108) evaluated the effectiveness of short -term targeted use of remote data transmission on treatment in patients who had out of range HbA1c measurements. [ 48] Transm itted data was reviewed by the clinic RN and if issues were identified, they were shared with the provider. There was no significant difference in changes in HbA1c from baseline to six months of follow -up. Pacaud et al. compared three models of education a nd communication support in newly diagnosed patients (N=68): web static (virtual appointments using asynchronous communication) versus web interactive (electronic communication and virtual appointments using synchronous and asynchronous communication) vers us a control group (face -to-face education, both synchronous and asynchronous). [ 49] There w ere no overall significant difference s among the three groups. The evidence review focused on the comparative effectiveness of telehealth requiring physician interaction or supervision versus standard pa tient management in improving T2 DM- relat ed outcomes. However, only three of the five studies identified involved physician interaction and the quality of this evidence was graded as low. One study evaluated patient education only vi a telehealth. [49] Another study , graded as moderate quality, utilized a RN for case management. [46] Based on the evidence, the Work Group determined a team approach incorporating all licensed independent providers was warranted , which is reflected in the recommendation language . In summary, data on telehealth outcomes were variable from no benefit to some statistically significant , but clinically insignificant benefits. Yet, no single study showed harm associated with telehealth ; outcomes were either neutral or a little to moderately beneficial. Conf idence in the quality of the evidence regarding the effectiveness of diabetes telehealth educatio n and support is limited. Improvements were seen in HbA1c when patients ha d the ability to upload glucose monitoring device VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in Primary Care April 2017 Page 28 of 160 data for review by the RN case manager or provider. Dedication of this resource to high -risk elevated HbA1c populations may help control outcomes where utilized . B. Glycemic Control Targets and Monitoring Recommendation 4. We recommend setting an HbA1c target range based on absolute risk reduction of significant microvascular complications, life expectancy , patient preferences and social determinants of health. (Strong for | Reviewed, New -added) Discussion Consensus suggests that, for summarizing evidence, estimates of absolute risk , rather than relative risk should be consistently provided for both benefits and harms or burdens. [50-52] The scientific basis for presumed benefits and harms derive s from th e absolute differences in achieved mean updated HbA1c levels (not a single point in time) between i ntervention and control groups and meaningful outcomes in clinical trials over a time period of many years. As a clinical example on how framing of trial r esults differs, we use the results from the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study 33 (UKPDS) which showed that the major benefit of lowering HbA1c from 7.9% (average) to 7.0% (average) over 10 years for recent onset disease was prevention of advanced microvascular complication, predominantly laser photocoagulation (absolute risk reduction [ARR] was 3.1/100 persons treated for 10 years). [53] The ARR of any microvascular complication w as 5.0/100 and the number needed to treat was 19.6. The relative risk reduction was a 37% decr ease in risk for microvascular complications and was continuous and without a threshold. [53,54] However, the ARR for each 1% reduction in HbA1c was less at lower levels of initial HbA1c. The microvascular benefit was sustained fo r 10 years after the trial was completed, although the average HbA1c values converged in the treatment groups. [55] There were three major trials conducted in th e 2000s that tested the hypothesis that intensive glycemic control (target goal of <7%) improved cardiovascular outcomes in patients with T2DM. Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) [56], Veteran Affairs Diabetes Trial (VADT) [57], and Action in Diabetes and Vascular Disease: Preterax and Diamicron Modified Release Controlled Evaluation (ADVANCE) [58] trials were conducted to answer the question of the macrovascular benefit of intensive control in patients with diabetes of longer duration. Over the course of the randomized trial fram e of the studies, there was no cardiovascular benefit in ADVANCE or VADT and there was increased mortality in ACCORD, leading to early termination of the study. After 10 years of follow -up, patients in VADT had 8.6 fewer major cardiovascular events but no survival benefit. [57] There was no cardiovascular benefit in the long -term follow -up of subjects in ADVANCE.[ 58] However, a microvascular benefit was observed during the follow -up period. For ADVANCE, the in- trial reductions in the risk of end stage renal disease (ESRD) (7 v ersus 20 events, hazard ratio [HR]: 0.35, p=0.0 2) persisted after 9.9 years of overall follow -up (29 v ersu s 53 events, HR : 0.54, p <0.01). These effects were greater in earlier- stage CKD (p=0.04) and at lower baseline systolic blood pressure levels VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in Primary Care April 2017 Page 29 of 160 (p=0.01). The effects of glucose lowering on the risks of death, cardiovascular death, or major cardiovascular events did not differ by levels of kidney function (p > 0.26). [58] These studies have established that the microvascular benefit of intensive control in patients who were older th an those enrolled in the UKPDS with longer duration of diabetes was less than in the UKPDS study. Macrovascular benefits were not observed. These studies establish that intensive co ntrol in an older population with established disease should not be routinely implemented. Three SRs have examined the effect of intensive glycemic control compared to standard/conventional glycemic control in managing adults with T2DM and the recommendat ions in this guideline are consistent with the individual RCTs and follow -up studies .[59-61] Three medications \u2014metformin, empagliflozin, and liraglutide \u2014have demonstrated a medication - specific benefit on cardiovascular outcomes in patients with T2DM at high risk for cardiovascular events. [62-64] However, while each of these medications lower average blood glucose, the mechanism remains unknown and the improved cardiovascular outcomes cannot be ascribed to intensive glycemic control. In recommending a target HbA1c goal for an individual patient, the clinician should tak e into account the patient's diabetes status ( e.g., new onset, intermediate duration, long standing) , diabetes complications , and an estimate of the life expectancy of the patient. We recommend that physicians discuss the magnitude of expected benefit usin g principles of ARR or number nee ded to treat, not relative r isk. The aforementioned studies can provide an order of magnitude of expected benefit, especially in older adults. [53-61 ] Additionally, c omorbid conditions and social determinants of health that could impact harms need to be assessed. Patient preferences for a target range are dependent upon individual assessments o f the risks and benefits of tighter glucose control as well as the use of medications to control hyperglycemia and impact upon lifestyle. SDM is a key process in setting HbA1c target ranges, as discussed in Recommendation 1 . We reco mmend a target HbA1c ra nge rather than an all or none Hb A1c target value for several reasons: 1) The clinical trials upon which the benefit of glycemic control is based use an updated HbA1c value over time; this cannot be generalized to maintaining an HbA1c v alue less than any single level. 2) Additionally, a single HbA1c measurement even from a high quality laboratory has a range around it (i.e., coefficient of variation [CV]). In many laboratories, sequential HbA1c values that are within 0.5% HbA1c are not sig nificantly different unless the is less than 3%, ideally 2%.[65] Comparing HbA1c tests performed in different clinical laboratories introduces another source of error, as does use of point -of-care testing, w hich tends to have higher CV than laboratory assays. 3) There may be racial differences between estimated a verage glucose (eAG) and HbA1c values in patients with T2DM based upon 7 -point glucose testing. [66] 4) Disease states that alter red blood cell turnover may falsely raise or lower HbA1c values discordant with actual blood glucose levels. VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in Primary Care April 2017 Page 30 of 160 Recommendation 5. We recommend developing an individualized glycemic management plan, based on the provider's appraisal o f the risk -benefit ratio and patient preferences. (Strong for | Reviewed, Amended) Discussion The most effective diabetes treatment plan is individualized to the patient. The benefits and risks of therapy are different for each patient, depending upon the individual's medical, social, psychological status, and personal goals and preferences. Understanding the patient's goals, lifestyle, and preferences helps the provider and team work collaboratively with the patient to create a personalized diabetes care plan that integrates the patient's values and preferences into the provider's assessm ent of the risk- benefit ratio. [26 ] Thus, the risks of a proposed therapy are balanced against the potential benefits. The partnership between the patient, provider, and healthcare team optimally begins at the time of initial diagnosis. The provider and team should stress that although diabetes is a serious condition, the patient can successfully manage it with attention to medications, diet, and physical activity. The other important part of this initial message is that there are a number of ways that diabetes can be successfully treated and that the best treatment plan is one that meets the patient's needs and preferences so that the patient will be more likely to take steps to successfully manage his or her diabetes e ach day. Patients should be encouraged to work with their provider and team to share decision making regarding glycemic targets, therapies, and goals of treatment. [31] Given the limited time available for visits, the healthcare team can gain useful information to help them tailor the risks and benefits of possible treatment plans to the individual patient. Given these considerations, the Work Group advocates for an individualized approach based on the patient's absolute risk for developing microvascular complications balanced against known comorbidities, projected life expectancy, presence or absence of pre -existing microvascular complications, the risk of polyphar macy with attendant drug -drug interactions, exposure to medications with limited post -marketing experience, the risk of and ability to perceive hypoglycemia, possible benefits to other comorbidities (such as beneficial effects on weight or hyperten sion), a nd patient preferences. [67] Recommendation 6. We recommend assessing patient characteristics such as race, ethnicity, chronic kidney disease, and non -glycemic factors (e.g., laboratory methodology and assay variability) when interpreting HbA1c, fructosamine and other glycemic biomarker results. (Strong for | Reviewed, New -added) Discussion If the provider suspects the HbA1c to be discordant from the patient's true level of glycemia, the provider should collect and interpret actual glucose levels to inform clinical decisions. Many factors affect the measurement of HbA1c besides the level of glycemia. [68] Some of these are well established. For example, since HbA1c is dependent upon duration of erythrocytes exposure to glucose , conditions that alter erythrocyte life span will affect the measured level of HbA1c. [69,70] Iron deficiency anemia, which prolongs red cell life and exposes the cell to glucose for a longer period of time , is associated with false elevations of HbA1c. [71] In contrast, conditions that reduce red cell life span ( e.g., hemolytic VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in Primary Care April 2017 Page 31 of 160 anemia) may result in falsely low HbA1c levels. A variety of other conditions may result in alterations in HbA1c measurement ( e.g., CKD) . Hemoglobin variants can result in either falsely elevated or falsely lowered HbA1c, depending on the specif ic assay used. [4,5,72] In addition, oral hypoglycemic agents (metformin or sulfonylureas) may alter the relationship between blood glucose levels and HbA1c, although the clinical significance is unclear. [73] There are racial/ethnic differences in HbA1c levels for a given level of glycemia. African Americans have, on average, about 0.4% higher HbA1c levels than Whites and this difference cannot be explained by measured differences in glycemia or sociodemographic factors, clinical factors, access to care, or quality of care. Racial differences were reported among participants in t he Diabetes Prevention Program. Despite having co mparable measures of glycemia, African Americans had significantly higher HbA1c levels (6.2%) than Whites (5.8%). [6] Racial differences have also been reported in patients with longer duration of diabetes. In the A Diabetes Outcome Progression Trial (ADOPT), baseline HbA1 c levels adjusted for age, sex, and BMI were 0.7% higher in African Americans (8.0% \u00b1 1.1) than Whites (7.3% \u00b1 0.8) despite comparable fasting glucose levels (153 mg/dL v ersu s 151 mg/dL). [74 ] Whether these differences are of sufficient magnitude to alter therapy (e.g., use different HbA1c target levels depending upon race ), is still a matter of controversy. [75,76] Further research is required to determine if racial/ethnic differences in HbA1c vary depending on the level of glycemic control, its clinical significanc e, and most importantly, implications for therapy. In light of this, the VA/DoD DM CPG continue s to recommend that a new diagnosis of diabetes be based upon a confirmatory fasting blood glucose level 126 mg/d L if the initial HbA1c value is between 6.5% an d 6.9%. How and where the HbA1c level is measured can also affect the result because of intra- laboratory variation (the variation in test accuracy and precision) and inter- laboratory variation (variation related to using different methodologies for the tes ts themselves). The National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program (NGSP) not only establishes standards but also reports on intra -laboratory variation, typically expressed as CV. Of particular note is that p oint-of-care measurements of HbA1c (e.g., fingerstick HbA1c tests) tend to have higher levels of CV, indicating that they may produce less accurate results. An analytical CV 2% will produce a 95% pro bability that a difference of 0.5% HbA1c between succes sive patient samples is due to a significant change in glycemic control (when HbA1c is 7% [53 mmol/mol]). [65] Therefore, using HbA1c for diagnosis and treatment requires a highly accurate methodology of a degree n ot required by regulation and that may vary among laboratories. Consequently, providers and patients need to be aware that HbA1c results can differ based upon laboratory factors as well as clinical factors. Assessing the impact of these patient characteris tics and non -glycemic factors that affect HbA1c levels allows for better individualization of management. For example, treatment decisions based upon HbA1c alone without consideration for glucose monitoring may result in unnecessary initiation or intensification of therapy. Thus, we recommend that treatment goals involve target ranges for HbA1c rather than levels above or below a specific target value for most persons with diabetes. This approach may avoid unnecessary intensification of medication due to random fluctuations within the range VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in Primary Care April 2017 Page 32 of 160 related to laboratory variation. This recommend ation allows for individualized treatment plans and is consistent with patient values. Data on other markers are lacking and continuous glucose monitoring is out of the scop e of this CPG. Recommendation s 7. We recommend an individualized target range for HbA1c taking into account individual preferences, presence or absence of microvascular complications, and presence or severity of comorbid conditions (See Table 2 ). (Strong for | Reviewed, New -replaced ) 8. We suggest a target HbA1c range of 6.0 -7.0% for patients with a life expectancy greater than 10 - 15 years and absent or mild microvascular complications, if it can be safely achieved (See Table 2 ). (Weak for | Reviewed, New -replaced ) 9. We recommend that in patients with type 2 diabetes, a range of HbA1c 7.0 -8.5% is appropriate for most individuals with established microvascular or macrovascular disease, comorbid conditions, or 5 -10 y ears life expectancy, if it can be safely achieved (See Table 2 ). (Strong for | Reviewed, New -added) 10. We suggest a target HbA1c range of 8.0 -9.0% for patients with type 2 diabetes with life expectancy <5 years, significant comorb id conditions, advanced complications of diabetes, or difficulties in self- management attributable to e.g., mental status, disability or other factors such as food insecurity and insufficient social support . (See Table 2 ). (Weak for | Reviewed, New -replaced ) Discussion A substantial body of evidence demonstrates a direct relationship between glucose control and microvascular complications (e.g. , retinopath y, neuropathy, nephropathy). Hig her levels of HbA1c carry greater risk of c omplications and lowering HbA1c prospectively reduces risk .[53,64,77] The relationship between HbA1c and the risk of microvascular complications is continuous, and may accelerate with HbA1c levels >9%. [78] There is no app arent threshold above which b enefits are not accrued by lowering HbA1c. However, in contrast to the relative risk of reduction of microvascular complications, which remains constant across HbA1c levels, the ARR is less at lower levels of mean achieved HbA1c than at higher levels. [ 54] Conversely, there are no data on the lower limit for achieved HbA1c , albeit there are strong data on the risks of hypoglycemia, as HbA1c is targeted to near no rmal levels for patients receiving insulin. [59] Lower levels of HbA1c (closer to 6%) may be reasonable in patients treated with metformin alone. Microvascular complications develop over an extended period of time. Thus, the subset of individuals with longer life expectancy and absent or mild microvascular complications (e.g ., early background retinopathy, microalbuminuria, mild neuropathy) are most likely to benefit from tig ht HbA1c control (i.e., 6.0 -7.0%), see Table 2 . VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in Primary Care April 2017 Page 33 of 160 Diabetes also confers substantial risk of CVD , but there is no evidence that lowering HbA1c to <8.5% reduces mortality, although it reduces the risk of non -fatal m yocardial infarction ( MI).[79] Indeed , in clinical of patients treated to HbA1c levels <7% [ 79-81], not only was there no benefit on CVD risk but one trial showed increased mortality during the course of the RCT.[80] Consistent with these findings, three SRs comparing intensive and conventional glucose control showed no significant differences in all- cause mortality or death from CVD, but did demonstrate significant risk reduction for microvascular complications such as nephropathy, retinopathy, a nd lower extremity amputation. [59-61] In some circumstances, aggressive glucose management may cause harms due to medication therapy . This is particularly true for patients with T2 DM treated with insulin. Intensive glucose control significantly increases the risk of severe hypoglycemia (e.g. , requiring help from another person) by two - fold when compared to conventional control. Follow -up of ACCORD study patients for a median of 8.8 years showed a significant 20% increased relative risk of death from cardiovasc ular events with intensive glycemic control, but the absolute risk difference of 0.13% per year was minimal, compared to standard , glycemi c control .[82] Intensi ve control is also assoc iated with increased weight gain. [81] It remains unknown if the risk/benefit ratio for intensive glucose control will differ with newer medications and/or extend to i nclude macrovascular benefits. However, the FDA does provide clinical alerts regarding complications of individual or classes of medications for complications including osteoporosis, congestive heart failure, urinary tract infections, dehydration, and acute kidney injury, among others. The risk of complications may be exacerbated by underlying comorbid condition s. Safely achieving intensive control requires attention to the risk factors for hypoglycemia. In addition to the higher risk of hypoglycemia with specific drugs (insulin and sulfonylureas ), factors associated with risk of hypoglycemia include advanced age (especially >75 years ), cognitive impairment, and chronic renal insufficiency (including causes unrel ated to diabetic nephropathy). [83-85] Addition al factors associated with hypoglycemia risk include lack of appropriate glucose monitoring, inadequate diabetes education, lack of family and social support systems, and food insufficiency. As a result of these factors, some patients may have life expectancies exceeding 10 years , yet be considered for less intensive glycemic control. The results of recent trials of intensive glycemic control evaluating cardiovascular outcomes can help to inform the target HbA1c range of a patient population that is unlikely to benef it from intensive control (HbA1c 6.0 -7.0%). Three major intensive control studies were designed to evaluate cardiovascular outcomes (ACCORD [56], VADT [ 57], and ADVANCE [ 58]), but varied somewhat in study populations, definition of intensive control, and intervention strateg ies. Nonetheless, the overall results did not show a reduction in macrovascular disease outcomes with intensive glucose control, while it did show a significantly increased risk of hypoglycemia. The target HbA1c in the standard control arm in ACCORD was 7 .0-7.9%, in ADVANCE the achieve d HbA1c was 7.3%, and in VADT the achieved HbA1c in the standard control group averaged 8. 4%. By considering the severity of diabetes complications, comorbid conditions, and estimation of life expectancy, clinicians can recommend a glycemic target range to be discussed with the individual patient. This is especially important for patients who would not have been candidates for the RCT because of decreased life expectancy, significant comorbid conditions, and social determinants of health that place them at greater risk for adverse events from medication therapy. VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in Primary Care April 2017 Page 34 of 160 Newer therapeutic options have been introduced since these major trials were completed, and further research is needed to understand which populations may benefit from the effects of newer therapies on macrovascular disease outcomes and/or lower HbA1c targets. In summary, the reviewed evidence support s a clinically significant benefit from intensive glycemic control ( HbA1c 6.0 -7.0%) in individuals with longer life expectancy, short duration of diabete s, and absent or mild microvascular complications. Life expectancy estimates are not always reliable, but can be estimated based on information discussed between patients and providers such as functional status, history of multiple recent hospitalizations, organ failure (advanced renal disease, liver disease, or heart failure), cancer diagnoses and their treatment plans, and advanced medical directives. For most patients with established microvas cular or macrovascular disease, comor bid conditions, or less t han 10 years life expectancy , it is reasonable to achieve a target HbA1c between 7 .0-8.5% , after discussion of the risks and benefits , see Table 2 . For patients with a life expectancy <5 years, the upper limit of HbA1c should reflect the need to avoid symptoms of hyperglycemia. As discussed in Recommendation 6, HbA1c is influenced by many factors, including age, race/ethnicity and anemia/hemoglobinopathies. In considering upper target levels, especially fo r individuals with comorbid conditions and limited life expectancy, the Work Group balanced benefit, safety, and preferences , and set that level at 9.0%. Preferably, decisions on intensification of therapy should be based on glucose levels and not HbA1c values. Additionally, there should be consideration of hyperglycemic and hypoglycemic symptoms, and patient preferences, especially regard ing initiation or change in insulin dosage. The overarching purpose of th ese four recommendation s is to move away from a one-size-fits-all approach , to individualized treatment plans and HbA1c target range that are tailored to a patient's unique characteristics and goals of care. The target range should be reviewed at least annually, or as a result of a request by the patie nt or healthcare team, or as a result of changes in the patient's medical status. VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in Primary Care April 2017 Page 35 of 160 Table 2: Determination of average target HbA1c level over time 1,2,3,4,5,12 Major Comorbidity6 or Physiologic Age Microvascular Complications Absent or Mild 7 Moderate 8 Advanced 9 Absent* > 10 -15 years of life expectancy6.0-7. 0% 7.0-8. 0% 7.5-8. 5% *Progression to major comp lications of diabetes is likely to occur in individuals with longer than 15 -20 years of life expectancy. Therefore, goal ranges are more beneficial early in disease in younger individuals, or healthier older adults with a longer l ife expectancy. Without s ignificant side effects, including but not limited to hypoglycemia. Further reductions may be appropriate, balancing safety and tolerability of therapy . HbA1c laboratory c onsiderations: 1 Based upon the NGSP reference standard. Clinicians need to obtain information regarding the CV from the methodology used at their site. As an example, an HbA1c of 8.0% from a laboratory with a CV of 3% would be within a 7.76 -8.24% range 13 out of 20 times (1 standard deviation), and would be between a 7.53 -8.47% range 19 out of 20 times (2 standard deviations). 2 The HbA1c range reflects an \"HbA1c average goal\" over time. Intensification or relaxation of therapy should be undertaken based upon individual clinical circumstances and treatment options. 3 A medication change in response to a single HbA1c test that encompasses the \"goal\" is discouraged, especially if it is discordant with self -monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) results. 4 African Americans, on average, have higher HbA1c levels than W hites and this difference cannot be explained by measured differences in glycemia. Caution is recommended in changing medication therapy based upon HbA1c results, especially for patients on insulin therapy, without correlation with SMBG results. 5 For all of the above reasons, the V A/DoD DM CPG does not recommend the use of estimated average glucose. Comorbid illness considerations: 6 Major comorbidity includes, but is not limited to, any or several of the following active conditions: significant CVD , severe CKD , severe COPD , severe chronic liver disease, recent stroke, and life -threatening malignancy. 7 Mild microvascular disease is defined by early background retinopathy, and/or microalbuminuria, and/or mild neuropathy. 8 Moderate microvascular disease is defined by pre -proliferative (without severe hemorrhage, intra -retinal microvascular anomalies (macroalbuminuria) and/or demonstrable peripheral neuropathy (sensory loss). 9 Advanced microvascular disease is defined by severe non -proliferative (with severe hemorrhage, IRMA, or neuropathy (e.g., gastroparesis, impaired sweating, orthostatic hypotension). 10 Major co morbidity is present, but is not end-stage and management is achievable. 11 Major co morbidity is present and is either end -stage or management is significantly challenging. This can include mental health conditions and substance/opioid use. Social determinant considerations: 12 Social determinants of health, including social support, ability to self -monitor on insulin, food insufficiency, and cognitive impairment need to be considered. Additional ly, side effects of medications and patient preferences need to be considered in a process of shared decision -making. VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in Primary Care April 2017 Page 36 of 160 Recommendation 11.We suggest that providers be aware that HbA1c variability is a risk factor for microvascular and macrovascular outcomes. (Weak f or | Reviewed, New -added) Discussion HbA1c variability refers to variation in glycemic control over the long -term as assessed by measurement of HbA1c , not the day -to-day variation in blood glucose levels. A variety of measures of HbA1c variability were use d including the standard deviation (SD) (how much values differ from the group mean) and also as a CV ( the ratio of SD to the mean ). An SR of 13 studies found consistent associations between HbA1c variability and micro - and macrovascular complications and mortality in T1DM and T2DM.[ 86] The association was greatest with mortality. However, the quality of evidence was low because of high risk of bias due to concerns regarding the small number of studies for analyses, the observational nature of the studies, retrospective design of some studies, unclear or short follow-up periods, and lack of adjustment for some potential confounders. Notably , the number of HbA1c meas urements per patient ranged from three to a median of 79 and follow -up pe riods were similarly variable. More recently, a retrospective study involving V eterans ( N >50,000) showed a similar association with mortality as well as MI and stroke ov er a mean period of 3.3 years. [87] Although HbA1c variability is an independent predictor of adverse health outcomes compared to mean HbA1c alone, there is insufficient information to make any statement about a causal effect of HbA1c variability on these outcomes. Thus, it is unknown whether reducing HbA1c variability will have beneficial or adverse effects. Further research is necessary to ass ess whether HbA1c variability would be useful clinically for risk stratification and whether it might be a valuable therapeutic target. The benefits of assessment of HbA1c variability outweigh the harms , and data from the patient focus group and elsewhere indicate that there is an interest among patients to have more information about DM management and optimal treatment. There are implications for resource use and feasibility related to the effort required to obtain the necessary data to calcul ate the degr ee of variability. There may be particular implications for DoD due to changes related to deployment ( operations tempo [ OPTEMPO] ). Further research is required to determine the best measures of HbA1c variability and practical means to communicate them, wh ether or not there is a dose-response relationship of magnitude of variability or exposure to variability, and most importantly whether intervention s to reduce HbA1c variability affects outcomes. C. Non-p harmacological Treatments Recommendation 12.We recommend offering therapeutic lifestyle changes counseling that includes nutrition, physical activity, cessation of smoking and excessive use of alcohol, and weight control to patients with diabetes (See VA/DoD CPGs for obesity, substance use disorders, and tobacco use cessation). (Strong for | Not Reviewed, Amended)VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in Primary Care April 2017 Page 37 of 160 Discussion All patients with diabetes should be given lifestyle counseling. Lifestyle changes counseling is indicated for all diabetes patients and should include nutrition guidance , physical activity, ce ssation of smoking and excessive use of alcohol, and weight control. [88-91] Based on the VA/DoD Obesity CPG, the definition of comprehensive lifestyle intervention is, \" interventions that comb ine three critical lifestyle components (i.e., dietary, physical activity and behavioral components) and i nclude at least 12 intervention sessions o ver a 12 -month period (See Recommendations 7, 10, 18, 23, 24, 31 and Appen dix G in the VA/DoD Obesity CPG9). The confidence in the quality of evidence for this recommendation is moderate and the benefits of therapeutic lifestyle changes counseling outweigh the harms/burden of implementing it. Among the included studies in the Aj ala et al. SR, three of the diets were compared to standard or control diet (high protein diet versus standard protein diet, low er carbohydrate diet versus control diet, and Mediterranean diet versus control diet) ; the others compared one diet to a differe nt diet (Ameri can Diabetes Association [ADA] diet versus ADA plus peanuts d iet, Atkins d iet versus ADA d iet, high -protein diet v ersus low protein d iet, low er carbohydrate d iet v ersus control d iet, low fat d iet v ersus low glycemic load d iet, Mediterranean d iet v ersus control d iet, vegan and v egetarian diets v ersus conventional d iabetes diet ). Only two of the diets were effective in weight management. [92 ] A referral to a dietitian to support dietary changes should occur. [93] There are benefits beyond glycemic control. The only harm identified is a potential increased risk of inj ury with physical activity. A patient's preferences and current level of health and comorbidities will vary and therefore must be taken into consideration. The medical nutrition therapy (MNT) process consists of distinct, interrelated steps: Nutrition Asse ssment: The registered dietitian nutritionist ( RDN ) collects and documents information such as food or nutrition -related history; biochemical data, medical tests and procedures; anthropometric measurements, nutrition -focused physical findings and client history. Diagnosis: Data collected during the nutrition assessment guides the RDN in selection of the appropriate nutrition diagnosis. Intervention: The RDN then selects the nutrition intervention that will be directed to the etiology of the nutrition proble m and aimed at alleviating the signs and symptoms of the diagnosis. Monitoring/Evaluation: The final step of the process is monitoring and evaluation, which the RDN uses to determine if the patient/client has achieved, or is making progress toward, the planned goals. Resource considerations include the cost of d iabetic nurse educators, RDNs , and behaviorists. It is also expensive, inconvenient, and time consuming for patients to adhere to therapeutic lifestyle changes. Resource availability to achieve goals varies (e.g., access to a smoking cessation class). Other factors, such 9 See the VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for Screening and Management of Overweight and Obesity.

For the management of obesity, in particular bariatric surgery, see the VA/DoD Obesity CPG .10 For smoking cessation and alcohol use , see the VA/DoD CPG for Treating Tobacco Use and Dependence and the VA/DoD SUD CPG .11,12 Further research studies are required to address sustainability over the long -term (greater than five years) . Research is also needed on effective methods to implement the interventions. Recommendation 13.We recommend a Mediterranean diet if aligned to patient's values and preferences. (Strong for | Re viewed, New -added) Discussion The ideal distribution of the three main food components, carbohydrates, proteins and fats, remains unclear. Dietary recommendations for improving glycemic outcomes often have focused on individual macronutrients, specifically carbohydrate reduction. Although carbohydrate reduction is well researched as a strategy for glycemic control, recent studies have focused on overall dietary patterns and the link to chronic disease control, prevention, and treatment . As such, a Mediterranean -style dietary pattern has been shown to be effective in improving glycemic control, delaying the time to first pharmacological intervention, in addition to reducing cardiovascular risk factors and weight in individuals with T2DM .[92 ] Despite known variation in the cuisine of Mediterranean countries, certain characteristic features are commonly used to describe a traditional Mediterranean diet: high intake of vegetables, fruits, nuts, unrefined grains, and olive oil; moderate intake of fish and poultry; low or moderate intake of wine; and low intake of red meat, processed meat, dairy, and sweets. In a meta -analysis of nine RCTs, Huo et al. found that a Mediterranean diet significantly reduced HbA1c and fasting glucose levels in patients with T2DM. [94 ] A similar SR by Esposito et al. found a 0.47% reduction in HbA1c favoring a Mediterranean diet compared to usual care or a low -fat diet.[ 95] A Mediterranean diet has also been linked to improved cardiovascular outcomes and weight loss. Huo et al. found a significant reduction in total cholesterol and triglyceride levels and increased HDL -C in those following a Mediterranean diet along with an average of weight loss of 0.29 kg.[94 ] Only three of the reviewed studies were based on the U.S. population and the availability of foods commo nly consumed as part of a Mediterranean diet may be perceived as difficult or challenging for 10 See t he V A/DoD C linical P ractice G uideline f or Screening a nd Management o f Overweight an d Obesity.

To improve compliance, MNT should be aligned with the patients' values and preferences and focused on attainable and sustain able dietary modifications. Although a Mediterranean diet has shown to improve glycemic control, weight, and cardiovascular outcomes in patients with T2DM more research is needed evaluating the effects and availability of the diet in the U.S. population, particularly in the VA and DoD. Recommendation 14. We recommend a nutrition intervention strategy reducing percent of energy from carbohydrate to 14 -45% per day and/or foods with lower glycemic index in patients with type 2 diabetes who do not choose the Medi terranean diet. (Strong for | Reviewed, New -added) Discussion A variety of dietary interventions have been shown to be effective for reducing HbA1c and other risk factors associated with complications of T2DM. There is increasing evidence that a low er carbohydrate diet improves glycemic control and leads to reduction in diabetes medication. [93,96 ] A low er carbohydra te diet was shown to achieve a greater reduction in triglycerides and increases in HDL -C in some studies suggesting the lower carbohydrate diet may be effective in reducing cardiovascular risk in patients with T2DM. [96] While the bodies of evidence for Mediterranean diet and lower carbohydrate dietary approaches showed their effectiveness in patients with T2DM, the evidence in support of the Mediterranean diet was mo re uniform and robust than that for the lower carbohydrate dietary approaches. Therefore, we recommend the Mediterranean diet be offered first to patients. However, depending on patients' values and preferences, those who do not prefer the Mediterranean di et are offered lower carbohydrate dietary approaches. During the VA/DoD Work Group analysis of multiple nutrition intervention strategies evaluating variable percentage of kilocalories (k cals) from carbohydrate, it was clear to the Work Group that in every study meeting GRADE requirements, the nutrition intervention strategy with a lower percent of energy coming from carbohydrate resulted in improved clinical surrogate markers. These markers included, but were not limited to HbA1 c, self-monitoring of blood glucose ( SMBG) values, post -prandial blood glucose , weight, reduction in pharmacological agent requirements, improved lipids, and improved blood pressure. While the Work Group is aware of the differences between the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics' (AND ) and our recommendations, our approach was based on our recent SR of the literature and considerations specific to the VA/DoD populations. An SR of 20 RCTs compared dietary interventions including low er carbohydrate and low glycemic index diets. [92 ] Evidence showed both dietary interventions improved glycemic control. The majority of the lower carbohydrate diets reviewed comprised between 14 -45% of energy from carb ohydrate and 25 - 28% from protein. Another study, an RCT by Fabricatore et al. , demonstrated that a Calorie -restricted, low glycemic index diet reduced HbA1c and promoted weight loss. [97]Improvement of glycemic control is independent of weight loss with low er carbohydrate diet s. Low glycemic index diets provide patients with another alternative. VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in Primary Care April 2017 Page 40 of 160 In a 16 -week trial, Yancy et al. showed that a low carbohydrate, ketogenic diet resulted in improved glycemic control and discontinued or reduced diabetes medication for most participants. [98] It was noted in this study that patients using a low carbohydrate ketogenic diet should be under close medical supervision or be capable of self -adjusting medication. Evidence for a very low carbohydrate ketogenic diet is increasing both for T2DM and weight loss. Low er carbohydrate diets, especially th ose containing less than 70 grams carbohydrate per day , should be planned carefully to assure proper nutrition with the assistance of a dietitian. Protein and fat replaces carbohydrate in a low er carbohydrate diet , which raises concern that increased dietary protein could cause deterioration in renal function in patients with advanced renal disease. Pedersen et al. compared a high protein diet to a standard protein diet which showed no evidence that increased protein intake (90 -120 grams protein per day, 30% of energy from protein) had any adverse effect on renal function in patients with mild renal impairment (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] > 40 mL/min/1.73 m 2).[99] This recommendation allows for meal planning options to account for patient preferences. The patient focus group expressed the desire for providers to take into consideration patient treatment preferences. Utilizing SDM may benefit patients when initiating a dietary intervention. We suggest diet ary education and behavior al counseling be facilitated by a RDN .[91 ] Studies show improved glycemic control and weight loss when intensive behavioral counseling and increased physical activity are combined with dietary interventions (see the VA/DoD Obesity CPG13).[93,96] There is no consensus on the definition of a low carbohydrate diet. Dietitians can offer low er carbohydrate options specifically tailored to the patient's needs, ensuring nutritional adequacy, and work with providers for timely adjustments of diabetes medications. For patients following a low er carbohydrate diet and who are taking hypoglycemia agents, management by an interdisciplinary team, including a dietitian, is recommended. The quality of the ev idence reviewed for this recommendation was low due to wide definition of components, imprecision, and limited duration and follow -up. Dietary intervention studies tend to compare diet versus diet rather than comparing diet versus control. Carbohydrate re duction and low glycemic index are suggested dietary options in which the benefits outweigh harms. Adherence to these dietary interventions may be expensive, inconvenient, and time consuming for patients with T2DM. Family member preferences affect the level of success of dietary interventions. A referral to a RDN may facilitate patient education and promote a more effective dietary intervention. These guidelines do not completely address the role of protein as a macronutrient in patients with mild renal dis ease. [99 ] However, the progression of advanced CKD (Stage 3 -4) might be delayed by protein r estriction of 0.6 -0.8 g/kg/d (s ee the VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Chronic Kidney Disease in Primary Care [VA/DoD CKD CPG]14). 13 See the VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for Screening and Management of Overweight and Obesity.

Available at: ht tp://www.healthquality.va.gov/guidelines/CD/ckd/ VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in Primary Care April 2017 Page 41 of 160 The VA/DoD population presents unique challenges of feasibility and acceptability of diet and lifestyle changes. Further research to determine new strategies that maximiz e adherence is needed for this population. Future research is needed to study the long- term effects of dietary modifications and specifically the implementation of a low glycemic index diet outside of the research setting. We did not address MNT in conjunc tion with pharmacotherapy because of lack of evidence. Research comparing initiating nutrition therapy as a first -line therapy versus pharmacotherapy is needed . D. Inpatient Care Recommendation 15. We recommend against targeting blood glucose levels < 110 mg/dL f or all hospitalized patients with type 2 diabetes receiving insulin. (Strong against | Reviewed, Amended) Discussion Hyperglycemia during hospitalization is associated with adverse outcomes independent of diabetes. Importantly, glucose lowering interventio ns have been shown to reduce morbidity and mortality in some critically ill populations. Most of the controversies in this setting have centered on the ideal and exact glucose target for hospitalized patients, as well as which populations would derive bene fit from glucose lowering interventions. Evidence to support \"tight\" glycemic control (80 -110 mg/d L) remains insufficient. Randomized trials examining glycemic control and/or insulin therapy are limited to the study of hospitalized patients with severe illness ( e.g., intensive care unit [ ICU], acute myocardial infarction ( AMI), acute stroke). In the Normoglycemia in Intensive Care Evaluation -Survival Using Glucose Algorithm Regulation (NICE -SUGAR) study, a blood glucose target of 180 mg/d L or less resulted in lower mortality ( odds ratio [ OR]=1.14) than did a target of 80 to 110 mg/d L in which hypoglycemia was more frequent (OR =14.7). [100 ] This data is often extrap olated to the inpatient setting at large, though there have been no controlled trials conducted in other settings evaluating \"tight\" control outcomes. The Efficacy of Volume Substitution and Insulin Therapy in Severe Sepsis (VISEP) trial was a four- arm study examining both fluid resuscitation and \"tight \" glycemic control (80 -110 mg/d L) in ICU patients with severe sepsis. [101] The trial was stopped early due t o high rates of hypoglycemia (17% v ersu s 4%). It is important to note that only 30% of the studied patients had a prior diabetes diagnosis ; presumably , hyperglycemia in the remainder of the patients was of a different process (e.g., stress hyperglycemia of critical illness), though the results seem to suggest that targeting lower glucose levels with insulin in the ICU can result in concerning rates of hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia is the most common complication associated with aggressive inpatient glycemic control, and is one of the leading adverse outcomes limiting the quality of trials addressing the benefits of intensive glycemic control. [100,102 ,103] In a meta -analysis by Griesdale et al., among the trials that reported hypoglycemia, the pooled relative risk with intensive insulin therapy was 6.0 (95 % CI: 4.5 to 8.0).[104] Severe and multiple hypoglycemic episodes are associated with increased risk of death in ICU patients. [105] VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in Primary Care April 2017 Page 42 of 160 While lower glucose levels might physiologically result in benefit, it can be logistically challenging to achieve them without risking hypoglycemia . In recent publications on the topic and in common clinical practice there is a greater appreciation of risk of harms from hypoglycemia. For these reasons and due to evidence suggesting harm with lower glucose levels, the Work G roup strongly recommend s 110 mg/d L as the lower limit for inpatie nt control. Advancement in glucose monitoring technologies , such as continuous glucose monitors (CGM) , may improve the capability to safely target lower glucose levels ; however, performance of these devices in acutely ill hospitalize d patients is not well studied. Recommendation 16. We recommend insulin be adjusted to maintain a blood glucose level between 110 and 180 mg/dL for patients with type 2 diabe tes in critically ill patients or those with acute myocardial infarction. (Strong for | Reviewed, Amended) Discussion Many of the trials examining insulin therapy in the hospital have specifically studied glucose -insulin - potassium (GIK) infusions with little or no regard to the glucose level or treatment of hyperglycemia. This is particularly evident in studies o f patients with AMI. SRs have generally found that GIK interventions do not improve outcomes especially if glucose lowering is not a goal. [103, 106-108] Moderate levels of glycemic control have not been well studied. One of the earliest randomized trials of insulin therapy after AMI that predates more rigoro us standards, the Diabetes Mellitus Insulin -Glucose Infusion in Acute M yocardial Infarction (DIGAMI) trial, was able to demonstrate reduced mortality rates with glucose lowering <180 mg/d L.[109] Among the patients with admission blood glucose levels 200 mg/d L who received the glucose -lowering intervention, mortality at one year decreased by 29%. A 58% relative reduction in hospital mortality in the intervention group was observed for the pre -defined sub - group of patients who were insulin na\u00efve and low cardiovascular risk, but not for the intent -to-treat group. Nevertheless, since the intervention arm of DIGAMI included three months of intensive insulin therapy after discharge, it was not possible to discern whether the reduction in long -term morbidity and mortality was due to inpatient treatment, outpatient treatment, or the combination. DIGAMI -2 was designed to resolve this issue, but was not successful in achieving this primary goal due to insufficient power, and again, the inability to reach treatment goals. [110] As standards of care have improved over the years, it has become increasingly difficult to design a study in which the control group is sufficiently more hyperglycemic th an the intervention group to demonstrate a difference in outcome. The mean glucose at 24 hours of the control group in the DIGAMI - 1 study was 211 mg/d L.[109] In contrast , the mean glucose of the control group in the recen t NICE- SUGAR trial was 144 mg/dL . This has several implications . First, trials such as NICE -SUGAR are examining the effects of \"tight\" glycemic control versus \"good\" glycemic control, not poor glycemic control , and therefore the absence of treatment benefit ob served cannot be used to justify hyperglycemia in the hospital setting. Second, a narrower gap between glucose levels in both groups requires a larger sample size, such as that of NICE -SUGAR, to have sufficient power to observe a significant benefit. VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in Primary Care April 2017 Page 43 of 160 Othe r important differences among inpatient insulin therapy trials include variable glucose targets and unknown glycemic variability . For instance, a mean glucose of 140 mg/d L in one trial may represent an average of many hypoglycemic and hyperglycemic episode s which may have markedly different effects on outcome s than what is observed in another trial where mean glucose is 140 mg/d L with little SD . Such information is not provided by most trials and this lack of information also limits the interpretation of SRs that cannot account for these differences. Similarly, there are differences in protocols among trials. This includes frequency and method of glucose measurement. Trials where glucose is measured infrequently may underestimate the rate of hypoglycemia whi ch could significantly impact outcomes. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that point -of-care testing, although the most practical method, is often inaccurate in critically ill patients. Lastly, it is important to note that while much of the controversy and attention has focused on the ideal glucose target, there are many ways in which the care of hospitalized individuals with diabetes and hyperglycemia can be improved. There is a growing body of literature examining the types and methods by which antidi abetic agents are applied in the hospital. [111- 114 ] While the methods to achieve glycemic target were not systematically reviewed as part of the literature re view, we note that in the studies reviewed, patients in the ICU were often treated with an insulin drip if their glycemia was above 180 mg/dL. Glucose target considerations: In order to identify potentially harmful hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia, blood glu cose monitoring may be ordered in hospitalized patients with diagnosed DM and/or hyperglycemia (blood glucose > 180 mg/d L) on admission. There is no evidence to support a given frequency of monitoring. Therefore, the frequency of monitoring should be based upon clinical judgment taking into account the management of diabetes, the reason for admission, and the stability of the patient. Treatment goals should be periodically reassessed based upon patient specific factors, including changes in the patient's hea lth status, adverse drug reactions, and patient preferences. Relative indications for raising the target glycemic goal include inability or unwillingness to adhere to a more intensive regimen, or an unacceptable risk of hypoglycemia relative to anticipate d benefits of near -normal glycemia. If the target range remains appropriate but has not been reached, the provider and patient should identify the reasons why the target has not been achiev ed and take appropriate action. Recommendation 17. We recommend agains t the use of split mixed insulin regimen for all hospitalized patients with type 2 diabetes. (Strong against | Reviewed, New -added) Discussion Split mixed insulin regimen is a twice -a-day insulin injection regimen with a fixed amount of mixed neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH) insulin ( intermediate -acting insulin ) and regular insulin. This insulin regimen requires consistent meal times and compositions to avoid hypoglycemia. Only two small studies VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in Primary Care April 2017 Page 44 of 160 could be identified to evaluate the effectiveness of split mixed insulin regimen versus basal -bolus insulin for hospitalized patients. It is important to note that the overall quality of evidence from these two trials is low to very low due to small sample sizes, poorly matched treatment arms, and concerns about gene ralizability to more broadly representative populations, including the VA/DoD patient population. Bellido et al. enrolled a total of 72 patients to compare split mixed to basal- bolus, with early termination of the trial due to increased risk for hypoglyc emia in the split mixed treatment group. [115] Variations between the baseline patient characteristics and meal plans make this evidence difficult to generalize to other patient populations, but the potential harm due to hypoglycemia is important to consider . Umpierrez et al. compared the use of a basal -bolus insulin regimen to a split mixed insulin regimen in 130 patients. [116] Rates of hypoglycemia did not significantly vary between treatment groups in this study. In both of these studies, baseline blood glucose and HbA1c did not vary between treatment groups, mean d aily blood glucose measurements did not significantly vary between groups, and there were no differences between treatment groups according to length of hospital stay. [115,116] These studies did not identify any benefit of using the split mixed insulin regimen over a basal- bolus insulin regimen for hospitalized patients. Split mixed regimens require consist ent meal plans in order to avoid hypoglycemia, which is difficult to provide in the hospital. In conclusion, due to the potential harms of split mixed insulin and lack of any demonstrable benefit over basal- bolus insulin, we recommend against the use of sp lit mixed insulin in hospitalized patients. Recommendation 18. We suggest a regimen including basal insulin and short -acting meal time or basal insulin and correction insulin for non -critically ill hospitalized patients with type 2 diabetes. (Weak for | Review ed, New -added) Discussion Key factors to consider in devising a glucose control strategy are pre -hospital total daily dose of insulin, calorie and carbohydrate intake, other factors that can decrease insulin sensitivity ( e.g., physiologic stressors, cortic osteroids) or increase insulin sensitivity ( e.g., renal failure, liver failure), and ease of implementation. The physiologic human pancreas constantly secretes some \"basal\" insulin while fasting, and releases a \"bolus\" of insulin to cover the glucose load associated with food intake to maintain euglycemia. In patients with insulin deficiency ( e.g., T1DM , long -standing T2DM , pancreoprivic diabetes), providing these modes of insulin action and adding a \"pre -meal supplemental correction\" insulin to cover for unanticipated glucose elevations will best replicate this physiology with intermittent subcutaneous insulin. This is referred to as a basal- bolus plus correction regimen. Basal- bolus plus pre -meal correction regimens are underutilized in the hospital, possibly due to their complexity, provider fear of hypoglycemia, and poorly established patient home total daily insulin dose. Thus, many patients are prescribed correction insulin only, dosed based upon a number of units assigned to treat a pre -specified gluc ose range on a scale or table called sliding scale insulin (SSI). While sliding scale only regimens may be easiest to start, in surgical patients , utilization of basal- bolus over SSI alone reduced the risk of post -surgical complications. [111 ] VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in Primary Care April 2017 Page 45 of 160 In terms of ease, a simple basal insulin dose plus pre -meal correction scale may seem more approachable to providers and is supported by a single study in which general me dical and surgical patients with T2DM treated with diet, oral antidiabetic agents, or low -dose insulin at home were shown to have similar glycemic control and frequency of hypoglycemic events on a basal- bolus plus correction versu s basal- bolus regimen . Both regimens resulted in better glycemic control and in fewer treatment failures than did the use of SSI alone. [117] Another practice that requires more study i s the application of before -bed correction insulin. In a single RCT, before -bed correction did not improve pre -breakfast fasting glucose levels, overall glycemic control, length of hospitalization, or hospital complications. While before -bed correction did not lead to increased rates of hypoglycemia, this study was underpowered for this outcome, and the risks from hypoglycemia, added complexity, and increased nursing workload suggest that routine use of before - bed correction should not be used. [114] Recommendation 19. We suggest providing medication education and diabetes survival skills to patients before hospital discharge. (Weak for | Reviewed, Amended) Discussion Although inpatient DSME is recommended by t he Joint Commission, there is relatively little high quality supporting evidence for this recommendation. There are several potential times that DSME educators might target to provid e care for patients with DM : at diagnosis, annually (to assess education, nutrition, and emotional needs), when new complicating factors influence self -management, and when transitions in care occur. [118] Diabetes care in the outpatient setting involves significant patient engagement, including dietary considerations, physical activity, home glucose testing, and medication management. The inpatient setting may provide an opportunity for provi ding education regarding self -management skills, including strategies (\"survival skills\") for addressing hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia, SMBG , and sick day management . Theoretically, providing education on self- management of diabetes could impact the overa ll quality of care. Conversely, the inpatient setting might not be ideal for providing such education. The patient will likely have competing medical concerns which precipitated the hospital admission, and the inpatient stay is frequently fast -paced and in volves procedures and testing. Thus, it is also possible that such training would be ineffective because patients would be unable to reliably engage and comprehend the care management recommendations. Observational studies suggest that there may be some b enefit from inpatient DSME , but this evidence is prone to bias given the nature of the study. [119] One small RCT examined the effect of inpatient DSME on outpatient outcomes for up to a year .[120] Although most outcomes (patient satisfaction, hospital readmission, and glycemic control at 12 months) were not different between intervention (multi - disciplinary diabetes education) and control (usual care), there was an improvement in HbA1c at 12 months for insulin na\u00efve patients who received the intervention . Despite being an RCT, this study was limited due to small sample size and imprecision, and was judged to be of very low quality evidence to support inpatient diabetes education. Another RCT compared patients who received diabetes education from a pharmac ist prior to discharge to usual care .[121] The primary outcomes were medication VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in Primary Care April 2017 Page 46 of 160 adherence (using refill data) at three months and glycemic control at four months a fter discharge. Patients receiving the intervention had greater medication adherence and better glycemic control at follow -up. However, this study was of low quality due to methodological issues and high dropout rate ; the overall evidence to support inpati ent diabetes education was very low. There are significant gaps in the evidence to support recommendations for inpatient diabetes education. There is inadequate evidence to assess which patients with diabetes might benefit most from inpatient education ; there are no high quality studies that have assessed for patient harms. Nonetheless, we suggest providing medication education, and basic information and skills ( \"survival skills \") to patients before discharge. Although the strength of evidence for this reco mmendation is low, it is likely that benefits outweigh harms or burden. E. Selected Complications Recommendation 20. We recommend performing a comprehensive foot risk assessment annually. (Strong for | Not Reviewed, Amended) Discussion A foot risk assessment is r ecommended on an annual basis. A complete foot risk assessment includes: [122] Evaluation of the skin: breakdown, callus, erythema, Evaluation for elevation, dependent rubor, pitting edema, and pedal pulses Evaluation for foot and/or nail deformities, trauma Prior history of ulcers or amputations Evaluation of patient's footwear and socks There are no harms associated with a diabetic foot risk assessment. It also offers the opportunity to reinfo rce the importance of regular foot exam by the patient. Patients with diabetes are at risk for developing peripheral neuropathy with loss of sensation. Patients who develop peripheral vascular disease or ESRD are considered high -risk for developing a foot ulcer. [122-124] There are moderate resources needed to accomplish this task, primarily the mini mal cost of the monofilament and added time at the appointment. Protective and prophylactic foot care and early detection of any deformity or skin breakdown may prevent the development of ulcers and risk of amputation. A person who has had a foot ulcer is at life - long risk of further ulceration. [122-124] Peripheral vascular diseases are associated w ith diabetic bilateral amputation. Preventative foot care programs should focus on peripheral vascular assessment to identify patients at risk and on the development of timely intervention strategies. [125 ] VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in Primary Care April 2017 Page 47 of 160 The tensile strength of mature scar tissue is about 80% of original tissue strength, thus increasing the chance of developing further ulceration. The patient should therefore be questioned about foot ulcer history. Further research is required to determine the effectiveness of patient/primary care team sensation testing as part of self- management and if this increased engagement decreases the frequency of poor foot outcomes. Recommendation 21. We recommend referr ing patients with limb -threatening conditions to the appropriate level of care for evaluation and treatment. (Strong for | Not Reviewed, Amended) Discussion The confidence in the quality of evidence for this recommendation is low. However, clinical observations on the natural course of untreated limb -threatening conditions suggest that the equipoise necessary to obtain stronger evidence, such as RCTs , does not exist, and recommendations therefore need to be based on lower levels of evidence. T he practice of referring patients with limb -threatening conditions is supported by the W ork Group , which conclu ded that the benefits most likely strongly outwe igh any potential harm for the patient. [122] Additionally, most patient s are expected to value an expert evaluation and opinion on a limb -threatening condition ; therefore, patients ' values and prefere nces are unlikely to vary significantly . There are, however, cost considerations associated with utilizing more specialty care and potential resource and equity issues regarding the availability of these specialists in smaller and remote communities. With these considerations , and considering that this is a recommendation carried forward from the previous version of the guideline, the W ork Group felt that it was appropriate to maintain a strong recommendation. In the unfortunate circumstances when amputatio n is necessary, clinicians may want to refer to the VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Rehabilitation of Lower Limb Amputation (VA/DoD Lower Limb Amputation CPG) .15 Below is a non -exhaustive list of conditions that should prompt the primary care pr ovider to consider a timely referral to a specialist. Systemic or Ascending (Worsening) Infection Limb -threatening conditions could include signs and symptoms of systemic infection including gas gangrene, ascending cellulitis , and lymphangitis or gangrene. Although infection is not always clinically apparent, common signs and symptoms include perilesional warmth, erythema, purulent drainage, odor, and involvement of bone. Pain may or may not be present. There may or may not be lymphangitis and lymphadenopat hy, and fever and white blood cell count may or may not be present. Sudden loss of glycemic control often heralds serious infections. [126] 15 See the VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Rehabilitation of Lower Limb Amputation. Available at: http://www.healthquality.va.gov/guidelines/Rehab/amp/ VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in Primary Care April 2017 Page 48 of 160 Vascular Compromise Absence of palpable pedal pulses - Examine the patient to determine presence of dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses. Absen t pulses and signs of acute ischemia (e.g., rest pain associated with dependent rubor with pallor , palpably cold extremities) warrant urgent referral to a vascular surgeon. Acute ischemia or rest pain -Evidence of arterial insufficiency: lower limb pain at rest, dusky/blue or purple/black color, gangrene, or cold extremity. Pain in the toes or forefoot may be relieved by dependency of the limb. Assessment is needed for prompt vascular/surgical intervention. Patients with acute arterial occlusion will presen t with pain, pallor, pulselessness, paresthesia, and/or paralysis. [126] Claudication - Severe claudication is determined by pain in the thigh or calf that occurs when walking less than one block and is relieved by rest. Foot Ulceration Cutaneous erosion with a loss of epithelium that ext ends to or through the dermis can involve deeper tissue and is characterized by an inability to self- repair in a timely and orderly manner. [122,127 -130] Puncture Wound A puncture wound is a lesion through the epidermis, dermis, and any other tissues caused by a piercing or penetrating object. Pa tients with diabetes with puncture wounds can quickly develop severe limb - threatening complications. Ingrown Toenail Ingrown toenail presents as a nail plate that has pierced the surrounding periungual tissue with associated erythema and drainage or an are a of thick or discolored callus. The primary care provider should consider referral to a podiatrist for excision of infected ingrown nails, especially in the case of high -risk patients. [131] Hemorrhagic Callus w ith or w ithout Cellulitis h emorrhagic callus with or w ithout cellulitis should be promptly referred to a foot care specialist for complete evaluation and treatment. The provider must determine if the cellulitis may be associated with callus tissue or necrotic tissue that may obscure an underlying ulceration or deeper infection. The callus tissue must be debrided to properly assess the extent of an underlying ulceration and possible deeper , more serious infection. Necrotic tissue must also be debrided to help eradicate the infection and determine the full extent of the infection. Further research is required to better compare outcomes in patients being seen by specialists versus primary care for non -urgent conditions, such as ingrown toenails. Recommendation 22. We recommend a retinal examination (e.g., dilated fundus examination by an eye care professional or retinal imaging with interpretation by a qualified, experienced reader) be used to detect retinopathy. (Strong for | Not Reviewed, Amended) VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in Primary Care April 2017 Page 49 of 160 Discussion The quality of the eye examination is a critical factor in the ability to detect early retinopathy . Thus, only qualified eye care professionals or trained readers using validated imaging techniques should be utilized for retinopathy screening and surveillanc e. Ophthalmoscopy should be performed through dilated pupils using high magnification and stereo viewing. Fundus photography is also highly sensitive in detecting clinically significant retinopathy and , when combined with interpretation by an ex perienced reader, may exceed the sensitivity of ophthalmoscopy in retinopathy detection. Non -mydriatic digital retinal imaging (i.e., fundus photography through a non -dilated pupil) also provides excellent sensitivity. [132] In some cases small pupils and/or media opacities will cause image degradation .[133] The combinati on of non - mydriatic digital retinal imaging with referral to an eye care specialist for patients in whom image quality is sub -optimal is an appropriate screening strategy as it can achieve a high level of sensitivity in the detection of retinopathy. In som e cases, selective use of mydriatic eye drops to facilitate improved image quality will enhance the diagnostic utility of digital retinal imaging . Recommendation 23. We suggest screening for retinopathy at least every other year (biennial screening) for patien ts who have had no retinopathy on all previous examinations. More frequent retinal examinations in such patients should be considered when risk factors associated with an increased rate of progression of retinopathy are present. Patients with existing reti nopathy should be managed in conjunction with an eye care professional and examined at intervals deemed appropriate for the level of retinopathy. (Weak f or | Not Reviewed, Amended) Discussion Patients with an acute change in vision or a change in ocular function should be urgently referred to an eye care provider. Symptoms such as blurring or loss of vision, severe pain or light sensitivity, double vision, distortion, floaters, or light flashes may indicate a serious ocular problem. Such complaints require urgent referral to an eye care provider. Visual symptoms clearly associated with fluctuations in blood glucose should be distinguished from those that are not as the former will typically resolve as glycemic control is improved. Nevertheless, it is pruden t to seek consultation with an eye care provider in all instances where there has been a sudden change in vision. Pregnancy may be associated with rapid deterioration of existing retinopathy and a higher risk of progression to vision threatening disease. A woman with pre -existing diabetes who becomes pregnant should be examined at the time of diagnosis and if she has greater than minimal retinopathy, repeat examinations should be performed at four to six week intervals. Proliferative retinopathy or clinically significant macular edema should be treated promptly. Those with less severe retinopathy should be monitored closely throughout their pregnancy (i.e., during each trimester). In the absence of an eye examination within the previous 12 months, patients who are pregnant should have an expedited appointment for a retinopathy evaluation. In addition, regardless of the timing of the last eye examination, the patient's eye care provider should be notified of the pregnancy. [134 ] Patients with newly diagnosed T2 DM may have had several years of sub -clinical or clinical diabetes prior to being diagnosed. Retinopathy can develo p during this time and up to 40% of patients will have VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in Primary Care April 2017 Page 50 of 160 evidence of diabetic eye disease at the time their diabetes is diagnosed. Although the prevalence of vision threatening retinopathy at the time of diagnosis is very low, there is a 3 -4% prevalence of proliferative retin opathy within the first few years of disease. Consequently, it is recommended that patients with new onset T2DM who have not had a dilated eye examination within the prior 12 months should have one performed within six months. [135] The inability of symptoms alone to accurately predict the presence or severity of retinopathy necessitates regularly scheduled retinal examinations for patients with diabetes. Some p atients will remain retinopathy -free for several years, but the course of diabetic eye disease cannot be reliably predicte d for a given individual. Risk factors for progression of retinopathy include: poorly controlled HbA1c (e.g. , >9.0 %), rapid substa ntial HbA1c improvement (a decrease of approximately 2% or greater over <6 months), insulin use, the presence of microvascular disease including pre -existing retinopathy, nephropathy or cardiac autonomic neuropathy, longer duration of disease, hyperlipidem ia, and poorly controlled bloo d pressure (e.g. systolic >160 mmHg). In light of these associations, it is prudent to perform more frequent retinal examinations in such patients. Clinicians should exert caution in extending biennial examinations to patients with factors associated with a higher likelihood of retinopathy progression .[135,136 ] Retinopathy of any level can progress rapidly over the course of a year and occasionally even mild retinopathy will progress to proliferative retinopathy within that time frame. As follow -up intervals shorter than 12 months may be indicated for some of these individuals, patients with retinopathy who have not had a retinal exam within the previous year should be referred for an expedited retinal evaluation. Patients who have previously undergone laser therapy have already reached the stage of vision threatening diabetic eye disease. [135] These patients require close follow- up and in the absence of information to the contrary should be considered at high risk for v ision loss and receive an expedited examination if they have not had one within the previous year. Duration of disease is most strongly associated with retinop athy in individuals with T1 DM. The prevalence of proliferative retinopathy approaches 30% after 1 5 years of diabetes and may rise to as much as 50% after 20 years. Although the prevalence of proliferative disease is lower in T2DM , the prevalence of any retinopathy approaches 75% in insulin -treated patients with longer duration of diabetes and the prev alence of proliferative retinopathy may exceed 20%. Different patients may exhibit separate and unique rates of retinopathy development or progression, but the likelihood of ocular involvement increases with duration of diabetes. [137] Recommendation s 24. We recommend that all females with pre- existing diabetes or personal history of diabetes and who are of reproductive potential be provided contraceptive options educ ation and education on the benefit of optimizing their glycemic control prior to attempting to conceive. (Strong f or | Not Reviewed, Amended) 25. We recommend that all females with pre- existing diabetes or personal history of diabetes who are planning pregnanc y be educated about the safest options of diabetes management during the pregnancy and referred to a maternal fetal medicine provider (when available) before, or as early as possible, once pregnancy is confirmed. (Strong f or | Not Reviewed, Amended) VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in Primary Care April 2017 Page 51 of 160 Discu ssion Hyperglycemia in pregnancy results in significantly elevated risks of both fetal and maternal harm ; many routine medications used in T2DM are contraindicated during pregnancy. Achieving glycemic control with recommended medications before pregnancy may prevent adverse outcomes and is encouraged whenever possible. [138] This can be best achieved through a coordinated effort between the patient, family, and care providers encompassing the patient's desires, lifestyle, advanced planning, and personal beliefs. Because of the high -risk nature of pregnancy complicated by diabetes and the need for intensive multidisciplinary monitoring and patient support, refe rral of women with diabetes to an expert high -risk perinatal team at the earliest possible opportunity must be considered as the standard of care. Ideally, such a referral should be made during the period of planned conception. While intervention studies w ill not be available to prove improved outcomes with diabetes management, significant fetal and maternal complications, including death and fetal demise, have been consistently associated with increasing HbA1c. As a result of these adverse outcomes, achiev ing a pre -pregnancy HbA1c of <7.0% is optimal. For further reference, please see the VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for Management of Pregnancy [VA/DoD Pregnancy CPG] 16). Fetal complications Neonatal hypoglycemia Maternal complications that occur at above average rates in diabetic pre gnancies include :[138] Preeclampsia Hypertension Preterm labor Need for cesarean section In addition to providing intensive glycemic control, the clinic ian overseeing the management of pregnant women should: [138] Prescribe supplemental folic acid and a dietetic regimen to ensure appropriate caloric intake during pregnancy Screen for autoimmune thyroid disease, hypertension, and kidney disease 16 See the VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for Management of Pregna ncy.

Pharmacological Therapy When individualized glycemic goals are not achieved with nonpharmacological therapy such as diet and physical activity, adjunctive therapy with medications is indicated (see Recommend ation 5 for a discussion of evidence regarding glycemic control). The magnitude of the reduction in HbA1c necessary to achieve goals should be considered when choosing medications and when assessing hypoglycemia risk, weight gain, patient preferences, administration burden, and cost (see Recommendations 4 and 7). For treatment of DM in obese patients, see the VA/DoD Obesity CPG .17 Considerations The evidence for pharmacological treatment options for T2DM was not systematically reviewed as part of this guideline update; therefore, formal recommendations could no t be made. The rationale to not systematically review the evidence for pharmacothera py was that the evidence in this area is rapidly evolving and therefore any recommendations made may be outdated during the lifetime of this guideline. In lieu of recommendations, the following considerations are offered based on usual care and recent SRs performed by other groups. Where applicable, users of this guideline are asked to refer to their respective agencies for guidance/criteria on the use of pharmacotherapy for T2DM that are based on the most current evidence. The following considerations are based on usual care and SRs performed by other groups: 1.When selecting an agent, consideration must be given to efficacy, contraindications, drug interaction s, co morbidities, and potential side effects. Discuss with patient s the various treatment options and arrive at a shared treatment plan. (See Appendix B ) 2.Insulin should be considered as initial therapy in any patient with hyperglycemia with significant symptoms, if ketosis is present, and in newly diagnosed or previousl y unrecognized T 1DM . 3.M etformin should be as the unless there are contraindications. 4.In patients with metformin intolerance or contraindications, other drug classes can be considered. These include (not in order of preference) : alpha -glucosidase inhibitors (AGIs), sulfonylureas (SU), and thiazolidinediones (TZDs). 5.When initial therapy no longer provides adequate glycemic control, addition of a second- line agent from another class rather than substitution is usually necessary. Substitution can be reserve d for intolerance/adverse effect to a drug . Combination of two anti- hyperglyc emic drugs has the benefit of reducing hyperglycemia by working on different mechanisms that causehyperglycemia (refer to Figure 1 ). Some agents are not generally used in combination or have not been studied in combination (re fer to Appendix C ). Although the evidence is clear on the relative efficacy of the various medications, their usage needs to be guided by clinical considerations. 17 See the VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for Screening and Management of Overweight and Obesity. A vailable at: http://www.healthquality.va.gov/guidelines/CD/obesity/VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in Primary Care April 2017 Page 53 of 160 6. Addition of basal insulin to existing regimen should be cons idered, particularly if the desired decrease in HbA1c is not likely to be achieved by use of combination therapy. 7. Patients and their families should be instructed to recognize and confirm their understanding of signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia and its m anagement. 8. Given that new studies and FDA alerts will be published subsequent to the release of th is guideline, clinicians should refer to the criteria for use published by the VA Pharmacy Benefits Management program (VA PBM) and the Department of Defense Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee (DoD P&T).

Summary of the Evidence - Monotherapy and Non -Insulin Two -Drug Combination Therapy Three SRs by the A gency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) have evaluated the comparative effectiveness and safety of diabetes medications. [140-143] The most recent review includes publications through December 2015. The evidence supports metformin as a first -line agent to treat T2DM based on its benefit -to-risk profile. A summary of the findings of the AHRQ reviews are summarized below. a.Reduction in HbA1c When used as monot herapy, metformin, SUs, TZDs, and repaglinide produced a similar reduction in HbA1c of about 1%. The -glucosidase inhibitors and nateglinide reduced HbA1c to a lesser extent (approximately 0.5%). [140] The DPP -4 inhibitors were found to be less effective in lowering HbA1c compared to SU and metformin with treatme nt were not included in the monotherapy assessments. The product labeling does not recommend t he GLP -1 agonists as first -line therapy; however, they hav e been studied as monotherapy. Comparative trials with dulaglutide and once -weekly exenatide showed reductions in HbA1c comparable to metformin and pioglitazone and greater than sitagliptin. [144,145 ] Another trial showed greater reduction in HbA1c with liraglutide com pared to glimepiride in patients VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in Primary Care April 2017 Page 55 of 160 who were either diabetes treatment na\u00efve or who were on prior SU at half- maximal dose. [146] As monotherapy, the average HbA1c reduction with the SGLT2 inhibitors is less than 1%. In a comparative study, empagliflozin was found to be comparable to sitagliptin. [147] Metformin plus a second a gent provided additional HbA1c lowering, ranging from 0.4 % to 1.0% over metformin alone .[141-143] Comparisons of various two -drug -based regimens show similar reduction DPP -4 inhibitors (treatment difference : 0.65%). [142,143] b. Weight SUs, TZDs, and meglitinides are associated with weight gain , while the GLP -1 agonists and SGLT2 inhibitor s are associated with weight loss. Metformin, DPP -4 inhibitors, and -glucosidase inhibitors are generally considered to be weight neutral. Direct comparison among the drugs associated with weight gain show the increase in weight is similar between SU s and meglitinides and less than TZDs. Among the weight neutral drugs, weight loss favored metformin compared to DPP -4 inhibitors. [141-143] c. Hypoglycemia SUs have a greater risk for hypoglycemia as monotherapy than metformin, TZDs, DPP -4 inhibitors , and GLP-1 agonists. In two -drug combination treatment comparisons, the risk of hypoglycemia with metformin + SU was greater than metformin + risk of was similar between metformin monotherapy and two -drug regimens SU and TZDs had minimal effect on systolic and diastolic blood by 3 -5 mmHg compared to metformin, SUs, and DPP -4 inhibitors. e. Adverse Effects Metformin, GLP -1 agonists, and acarbose are associated with more GI side effects (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) than SUs, TZDs, and DPP-4 inhibitors. [140-143] The SGLT2 were not included in the comparisons, but are typically not associated with increased GI side effects. f. Lipids The TZDs are associated with increase in low -density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL -C) and metformin is associated with decrease in LDL -C. The SUs, DPP -4 inhibitors, acarbose, and repaglinide have little effect on LDL -C. In comparative analyses, metformin decreased LDL -C level s relative to SU s, DPP -4 inhibitors, and TZDs.

The addition of a TZD to dual therapy further decreased HbA1c (treatment difference : -0.94%, 95%CI : -1.18 to -0.70), but increased weight (estimated treatment difference: 2.72 kg, 95%CI : 1.45 to 3.99). The addition of a SU to dual therapy further decreased HbA1c (treatment difference : -0.59%, 95%CI : -0.90 to -0.28), but increased weight (estimated treatment difference: 3.23 kg, 95%CI : 1.56 to 4.90). The addition of insulin to dual therapy further decreased HbA1 c (treatment difference : -0.91% , 95%CI : -1.13 to -0.69), but increased weight (estimated treatment difference: 2.34 kg, 95%CI : 1.18 to 3.50). Direct comparison of non -insulin containing triple therapy regimens There are few head -to-head trials comparing non- insulin conta ining triple therapy regime ns. Most trials compared a third agent as add- on to metformin + SU . All treatments provided additional HbA1 c lowering; however, differences between treatments were relatively small. The impact on weight favored those drugs that are known to cause weight lo ss.

The GLP -1 agonists in combination with insulin were not addressed in the 2010 DM CPG and a brief summary of the evidence is provided. An SR and meta -analysis of 15 studies ( N=4,348) of at least eight weeks duration a ddressed combination use of GLP -1 recept or agonists and basal insulin. [155] the addition of a GLP -1 agonist to basal insulin compared to basal insulin alone. Both treatment groups allowed the use of oral agents. Four studies compared a GLP -1 agonist to mealtime insulin. All patients had background basal insulin with or without oral agents . The primary endpoints were change in glycemic control, hypoglycemia, and weight between baseline and end of intervention . GLP- 1 agonist and basal insulin combination treatment compared to other anti -hyperglycemic treatments showed a mean reduction in HbA1c of 0.44% (95% CI : -0.60 to -0.29), increased likelihood of achieving target HbA1c < 7% (relative risk : 1.92, 95% CI : 1.43 to 2.56), did not have an impact on the risk of hypoglycemia (0.9 9, 95% CI : 0.76 to 1.29) and a mean reduction in weight of -3.22 kg (95% CI : -4.90 to -1.54). Limitations of the study included the long-term durability of the treatment (mean 24.8 weeks); potential risk of bias with some studies having open -label design and pharmaceutical industry funding; differences in GLP- 1 agonist preparation (short -acting, twice -daily formulations, intermediate once -daily products, and long- acting weekly drugs); long -term durability, safety, and side effects of GLP -1 agonists have n ot been established; and the ideal timing for the start of treatment in the clinical course of the disease.[ 155] VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in Primary Care April 2017 Page 59 of 160 Table 5: Insulin: Summary of Pharmacokinetics [139, 156-161 ] Insulin Onset Peak (bolus) Insulin Rapid -Acting Insulin aspart NovoLog: 0.2 to 0.3 h r NovoLog Mix 70/30: 10 to 20 mins NovoLog: 1 to 3 hrs NovoLog Mix 70/30: 1 to 4 hrs NovoLog: 3 to 5 hrs NovoLog Mix 70/30: 18 to 24 hrs Subcutaneous: 81 min (NovoLog); 8 to 9 hrs (NovoLog Mix 70/30) Appearance: clear; covers insulin needs at the time of the injection Insulin lispro Subcutaneous: 0.25 to 0.5 hr Subcutaneous: 0.5 to 2.5 hrs Subcutaneous: 5 hrs Subcutaneous: 1 hr, IV: 51 to 55 mins Insulin glulisine 5 to 15 min s 1.6 to 2.8 h r <5 hrs IV: 13 mins, Subcutaneous: 42 mins Short -Acting Regular insulin Subcutaneous: 0.5 h r, IV: 10 to 15 min s Subcutaneous: 3 hrs U 100: 4 to 12 h rs; U 500: up to 24 h rs IV: 17 min s, Subcutaneous: 86 to 141 mins Appearance: clear; covers insulin ne eds for meals eaten 30-60 mins Basal Insulin Intermediate -Acting Insulin isophane (NPH) 1 to 1.5 hrs 4 to 12 hrs 14.5 hrs 4.4 hrs Appearance: cloudy; covers insulin needs for about half the day or overnight.

Cardiovascular Outcomes Trials a. DPP -4 Inhibitors and Cardiovascular Outcomes The long- term cardiovascular safety trials for saxagliptin ( Saxagliptin Assessment of Vascular Outcomes Diabetes Mellitus [SAVOR] ), alogliptin ( Examination of Cardiovascular Outcomes with versus Standard of Care [EXAMINE ]), and sitagliptin ( Trial Evaluating Cardiovascular Outcomes with Sitagliptin [TECOS ]) were conducted in patients with T2DM who had a history of , or were at high risk for , cardiovascular events. The results showed that there was no increase or decrease in the primary endpoint (com posit e of cardiovascular death, nonfatal MI, or nonfatal ischemic stroke) between the DPP -4 inhibitors and placebo. [162-164] A secondary endpoint from the SAVOR trial found a higher risk of hospitalization for heart failure in patients receiving saxagliptin relative to placebo ( HR=1.27 1.51, p=0.007 ). Post -hoc analyses of SAVOR found that patients with Class 3 or 4 heart failure, or eGFR < 60mL/min were at a greater risk for hospitalization for heart failure. Hospitalization due to heart failure was not a predefined endpoint. In the EXAMI NE trial for alogliptin, a post -hoc analysis found a numerically higher risk of hospitalization for heart failure in patients receiving alogliptin relative to placebo (HR=1.19, 95%CI : 0.90 to 1.58, p=0.220) . A secondary endpoint in the TECOS trial found that the rate of hospitalization for heart failure did not differ between sitagliptin and placebo (HR=1.0 , 95%CI : 0.83 to 1.20 , p=0.98 ). It is unknown if true differences exist between agents as trials did not directly compar e one agent to another and study populations and methodology differed. However, two large observational studies found the risk for hospitalization for h eart failure was not greater with saxagliptin compared to sitagliptin. [165,166 ] The long- term trial for linagliptin ( Card iovascular Outcome Trial of Linagliptin Versus Glimepiride in Type 2 Diabetes [CAROLINA ]) is ongoing and expected to be completed in 2019. This is the first comparative trial evaluating linagliptin and glimepiride in patients who have early T2DM and increased cardiovascular risk or established complications. The labeling for saxagliptin and alogliptin state that the risks and benefits of saxagliptin or alogliptin should be considered prior to initiating treatment in patients at a higher risk for he art failure. Observe patients for signs and symptoms of heart failure during therapy. Advise patients of the characteristic symptoms of heart failure and to immediately report such symptoms. If heart failure develops, evaluate and manage according to curre nt standards of care and consider discontinuation of saxagliptin/alogliptin.

[168] There was no significant difference between pioglitazone and placebo in the primary endpoint (composite of all -cause mortality, non-fatal MI [including silent MI ], stroke, acute coronary syndrome, leg amputation, coronary revascularization, or revascularization of the leg ) (HR=0.90, 95%CI: 1.02 p=0.095) secondary endpoint (composite all -cause mortality, non-fatal MI, and stroke) showed a significant reduction in events with pioglitazone compared to reported more often with pioglitazone (10.8%) than placebo (7.5%). Hospitalization for heart failure was also reported more frequently with pioglitazone (5.7%) than placebo (4.1%). Another large trial ( Insulin Resist ance Intervention after Stroke [ IRIS]) compared pioglitazone to placebo in patients with insulin resistance who had had a recent ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA). There was a significant reduction in the primary ou tcome (fatal or nonfatal stroke or MI ) and Miti gation Strategy (REMS) for rosiglitazone -containing medicines was removed by the FDA after determining that data from the Rosiglitazone Evaluated for Cardiac Outcomes and Regulation of Glycaemia in Diabetes ( RECORD ) trial did not show an increased risk of MI. The long- term cardiovascular trial for rosiglitazone ( RECORD) was a randomized, multicenter, open- label, non - inferiority trial. Patients with T2DM ( N=4,447) who were receiving metformin or sulfonylurea and had VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline f or the Management o f Type 2 Diabetes Mell itus in Primary Care April 2017 Page 63 of 160 inadequate glycemic control were randomize d to add -on rosiglitazone or placebo (control group). The primary end point was hospitalization or death from cardiovascular causes. Results showed non -inferiority of rosiglitazone compared to placebo. The primary endpoint occurred in 321 patients in the r osiglitazone group and 323 patients in the control group over the 5.5 year follow up period (HR= 0.99 , 95% CI : 0.85 to 1.16). Additional results showed non -inferiority for cardiovascular death (HR=0.84 , 95% CI : 0.59 to 1.18), MI (HR=1.14, : 0.80 to 1.63), and stroke (HR=0.72 , 95% CI : 0.49 to 1.06). There was no significant difference between rosiglitazone and the control group regarding MI and death from cardiovascular causes or any cause. Similar to pioglitazone, heart failure leading to hospitalizat ion was reported more often with rosiglitazo ne compared to placebo (HR=2.10, 95% CI : 1.35 to 3.27). c.GLP -1 Receptor Agonists and Cardiovascular Outcomes Liraglutide is the first of the GLP -1 class to show cardiovascular benefit (Liraglutide Effect and Actio n in Diabetes: Evaluation of Cardiovascular Outcome Results [LEADER ] trial) in patients with T2DM and high cardiovascular risk.[62] Lixisenatide with T2DM patients who had MI or who had been hospitalized for unstable angina, did not show cardiovascular benefit in the Evaluation of Lixisenatide in Acute Coronary Syndrome [ELIXA] t rial.[ 170] The primary composite outcome in the liraglutide study (LEADER) was a time -to-event analysis of the first occurrence of death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal MI, or nonfatal stroke with a primary hypothesis of non -inferiority to placebo. The liraglutide group had significantly fewer patients with the primary outcome (HR =0.87, 95% CI: 0. 78 to 0.97 , p <0.001 for non -inferiority; p=0.01 for superiority) . The rate of death due 95% CI: 0.66 0.74 to 0.97, p=0.02) was lower in the liraglutide group than in the placebo group. There were non -significant reduction in the rates o f nonfatal MI, nonfatal stroke, and hospitalization for heart failure in the liraglutide group versus the placebo group. The primary composite end point of the lixisenatide study (ELIXA) was cardiovascular death, MI , stroke, or hospitalization for unstable angina. Lixisenatide showed non -inferiority to placebo in the primary end- point event (HR =1.02, 95% CI: 0.89 to p<0.001) but did not show superiority ( p=0.81). The two groups showed no significant differences in the rate of hospitalization for heart failure (HR in the lixisenatide group= 0.96, 95% CI: 0.75 to 1.23) of death (HR =0.94, 95% CI: 0.78 to 1.13). Other cardiovascular safety trials with the GLP -1 class are ongoing (See Table 7 ).

SGLT2 Inhibitors and Cardiovascular Outcomes One long- term prospective cardiovascular outcomes trial has been completed with a SGLT2 inhibitor to date. The Empagliflozin Cardiovascular Outcome Event Trial in Ty pe 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients (EMPA - REG OUTCOME) trial evaluated the time to first event of cardiovascular death, non- fatal MI, or non -fatal stroke in patients randomized to empagliflozin or placebo. [63] The primary composite outcome was statistically significant for patients in the empagliflozin group compared to placebo with a 32% relative risk reduction (2.6% ARR ) in death from any cause in the pooled empagliflozin group. The number needed to treat was 39 patients for three years to prevent one death. In terms of death fro m cardiovascular causes, empagliflozin showed a 38% relative risk reduction (2.2% ARR). To prevent one death from cardiovascular causes, 45 patients would need to be treated for three years. A predefined secondary outcome (composite of the primary outcome plus hospitalization for unstable angina) was also statistically significant in the empagliflozin arm revealing a 35% relative risk reduction (1.4% ARR) in hospitalization for heart failure. Seventy -one patients would need to be treated for three years to prevent one hospitalization. Of note, 77% of patients were taking statins concomitantly. This study only included patients with a high risk of CVD and did not include patients without CVD .[63 ] Other cardiovascular safety trials with the SGLT2 inhibitor class are ongoing (See Table 8 ).

Knowledge Gaps and Recommended Research During the course of guideline development, the Work Group identified important areas for future research to assist in the next DM CPG update. Evidence shows that DSME is effective but most reviews called for further research by way of well- designed longitudinal studies. Research on comparative effectiveness of in -person versus technology - based education is needed. I nvestigation of effect ive modalities of DSME to provide education in areas where an educator is not available is also of interes t. Three major intensive control studies of target HbA1c were designed to evaluate cardiovascular outcomes (ACCORD [56], VADT [ 57], and ADVANCE [58]). Newer therapeutic options have been introduced since the se major trials w ere completed, and further research is needed to understand the effects of inten sive control with newer therapies on macrovascular disease outcomes. Further research is also required to determine whether HbA1c varies with racial/ethnic differences depending on the level of glycemic control, their clinical significance, and most importantly, implications for therapy. More research is required to determine the best measures of HbA1c variability and practical means to communicate them, whether or not there is a dose-response relationship for magnitude of variability or exposure to variab ility and , most importantly , whether intervention s to reduce HbA1c variability affect outcomes. There is a gap in research studies on therapeutic lifestyle counseling for all patients with T2DM that address sustainability over the long- term (greater than f ive years) and effective methods to implement interventions. VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline f or the Management o f Type 2 Diabetes Mell itus in Primary Care April 2017 Page 66 of 160 Although a Mediterranean diet has been shown to improve glycemic control, weight, and cardiovascular outcomes in patients with T2DM, more research is needed to evaluate the effects and availability of the diet in the U.S. population, particularly in the VA and DoD populations . The VA/DoD population presents unique challenges regarding feasibility and acceptability of diet and lifestyle changes. Further research to determine new strategies that maximize adherence is needed for this population. Research is also needed to study the long- term effects of dietary modifications and specifically the implementation of a low glycemic index diet outside of the research setting. This CPG does not address MNT in conjunction with pharmacotherapy due to lack of evidence. Research comparing initiating nutrition therapy as a first-line therapy versus pharmacotherapy is needed. Advancement in glucose monitoring technologies such as CGM s may improve the capability to safely target lower glucose levels, however, performance of these devices in acutely ill hospitalized patients is not well studied. Another practice that requires more study is the application of before -bed correction insulin for non -ICU hospitalized patie nts with T2DM . There are significant gaps in the evidence to support recommendations for inpatient diabetes education. There is inadequate evidence to assess which patients might benefit most from inpatient DM education and there are no high quality studi es that have assessed for patient harms. Further research is required to determine the effectiveness of patient/lay person sensation testing as part of foot care self- management and if this increase in patient engagement decreases the frequency of poor fo ot outcomes. More studies are required to better compare outcomes of patients with limb - threatening conditions being seen by specialists versus primary care providers for non -urgent conditions, such as ingrown toenails . VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in Primary Care April 2017 Page 67 of 160 Appendix A: Evidence Review Methodo logy A. Developing the Scope and Key Questions The Champions, along with the Work Group, were tasked with identifying KQs to guide the systematic review of the literature on DM. These questions, which were developed in consultation with the Lewin team, addres sed clinical topics of the highest priority for the VA and DoD populations. The KQs follow the population, intervention, comparison, outcome, timing and setting (PICOTS) framework for evidence questions, as established by the AHRQ . Table A -1 provides a brief overview of the PICOTS typology. Table A -1. PICOTS [177 ] P Patients, Population, or Problem A description of the patients of interest. It includes the condition(s), populations or sub- populations, disease severity or stage, co -occurring conditions, and other patient characteristics or demographics. I Intervention or Exposure Refers to the specific treatments or approaches used with the patient or populati on. It includes doses, frequency, methods of administering treatments, etc. C Comparison Describes the interventions or care that is being compared with the intervention(s) of interest described above. It includes alternatives such as placebo, drugs, surg ery, lifestyle changes, standard of care, etc. O Outcome Describes the specific results of interest. Outcomes can include short, intermediate, and long- term outcomes, or specific results such as quality of life, complications, mortality, morbidity, etc. (T) Timing, if applicable Describes the duration of time that is of interest for the particular patient intervention and outcome, benefit, or harm to occur (or not occur). (S) Setting, if applicable Describes the setting or context of interest. Setting ca n be a location (such as primary, specialty, or inpatient care). The Champions , Work Group, and evidence review team carried out several iterations of this process, each time narrowing the scope of the CPG and the literature review by prioritizing the top ics of interest. Due to resource constraints, all developed KQs could not be included in the systematic evidence review. Thus, the Champions and Work Group determined which questions were of highest priority and those were included in the review. Table A-5 contains the final set of KQs used to guide the systematic evidence review for this CPG. a.Population(s) Adults 18 years or older with T2DM treated in any VA/DoD primary care setting The KQs are specific to adults 18 years or older with T2DM treated in any VA/DoD primary care setting.

Conducting the Systematic Review Extensive literature searches using the search terms and strategy included in Appendix H identified 5 ,012 citations potentially addressing the KQs of interest to this evidence review. Of those, 1 ,940 were excluded upon title review for clearly not meeting inclusion criteria (e.g., not pertinent to the topic, not published in English, published prior to study inclusion publication date, not a full -length article). Overall, 3 ,072 abstracts were reviewed with 2 ,328 of those being excluded for the following reasons: not a n SR or clinical study, did not address a KQ of interest to this review, did not enroll a population of interest, or published prior to January 1 , 2009. A total of 744 full- length articles were reviewed. Of those, 453 were excluded at a first-pass review for the following: not addressing a key question of interest, not enrolling the population of interest, not meeting inclusion criteria for clinical stu dy or SR , not meeting inclusion criteria for any key question, or being a duplicate. A total of 291 full- length articles were thought to address one or more key questions and were further reviewed. Of these, 233 were ultimately excluded. Reasons for their exclusion are presented in Figure A- 1 below. Overall, 58 studies addressed one or more of the KQs and were considered as evidence in this review. Table A -5 indicates the number of studies that add ressed each of the questions.

If multiple SRs address a key question, we selected the most recen t and/or comprehensive review. SRs were supplemented with clinical studies published subsequent to the SR. Studies must be published in English. VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in Primary Care April 2017 Page 74 of 160 Publication must be a full clinical study or SR ; abstracts alone were not included. Similarly, letters, editori als, and other publications that are not full- length clinical studies were not accepted as evidence. Intervention studies had a treatment or management style and were a prospective, randomized controlled trial with an independent control group, unless oth erwise noted (see Key Question Specific Criteria below). The ideal diagnostic study compares clinical outcomes after diagnostic technology evaluation versus clinical evaluation, or compares clinical outcomes linked t o different diagnostic technologies. Non -comparative diagnostic studies reporting only characteristics of the diagnostic test (e.g., sensitivity, specificity, repeatability) were excluded. However, non -comparative diagnostic studies that report a change in management strategy or patient outcomes (e.g., evidence of organic based disease patterns) were considered. Study must have enrolled at least 20 patients (10 per study group) unless otherwise noted. (see Key Question Specific Criteria below.) Study must have reported on an outcome of interest. Study must have enrolled a patient population in which at least 80% of patients had a diagnosis of T2DM. If the percentage is less than 80%, then data must have been reported s eparately for this patient subgroup. ii.Key Question Specific Criteria For KQ 1, acceptable study designs included SRs, RCTs, including follow -up studies of RCTs, cohorts and pre -planned, prospective analyses of those studies. Retrospective analyses were not included. For KQs 2 -4, 8, and 9, acceptable study designs included SRs of RCTs and/or individual RCTs. For KQ 5, acceptable study designs included SRs of acceptable study designs, individual RCTs or prospective nonrandomized controlled studies. For KQ 6, acceptable study designs included SRs of acceptable study designs, RCTs or prospective cohort studies that statistically compared outcomes for patients with T2DM and higher versus lower glucose variability. Large retrospective studies (200 patients minimu m) that performed multivariate statistical analyses of the effect of higher and lower glucose variability on patient outcomes were also acceptable. For KQ7, it was determined after initial searches that the KQ required additional refinement and updated sea rches. Searches were updated to capture cl inical studies or SRs published on or after January 1, 2009 to June 14, 2016. For KQ7, acceptable study designs included SRs , prospective blinded trials, cohort, or case - control studies comparing diabetes managemen t metrics to HbA1 c. For assessment of diagnostic accuracy, diagnostic cohort studies that compare a diagnostic test(s) to a reference standard (HbA1 c) within the same patient were acceptable. For KQ9, trials set outside of the U.S. were considered to be out of scope, as the potential differences in education, support, cultural norms, and socioeconomic setting could VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in Primary Care April 2017 Page 75 of 160 potentially limit applicability. Additionally, the minimum sample size per treatment arm was 50 patients. b.Literature Search Strategy Information regarding the bibliographic databases, date limits, and platform/provider can be found in Table A -6, below.

Convening the Face -to-face Meeting In consultation with the contracting officer's repres entative, the Champions, and the Work Group, the Lewin Team convened a three and a half day face -to-face meeting of the Champions and Work Group members on June 21 -24, 2016 . These experts were gathered to develop and draft the clinical recommendations for an update to the 2010 DM CPG. Lewin presented findings from the evidence review of KQs 1 -9 in order to facilitate and inform the process. Under the direction of the Champions, the Work Group members were charged with interpreting the results of the evidence review, and asked to categorize and carry forward recommendations from the 2010 DM CPG, modifying the recommendations as necessary . The members also developed new clinical practice recommendations not presented in the 2010 DM CPG, based on the 2016 evidence review. The subject matter experts were divided into three smaller subgroups at this meeting. VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in Primary Care April 2017 Page 76 of 160 As the Work Group members drafted clinical practice recommendations, they also assigned a grade for each recommendation based on a modified GRADE and USPSTF methodology. Each recommendation was graded by assessing the quality of the overall evidence base, the associated benefits and harms, the variation in values and preferences, and other implications of the recommendation. In addition to developing recommendations during the face -to-face meeting, the Work Group members also revised the 2010 DM CPG algorithms to reflect the new and amended recommendations. They discusse d the available evidence as well as changes in clinical practice since 2010, as necessary, to update the algorithms. D. Grading Recommendations This CPG uses the GRADE methodology to assess the quality of the evidence base and assign a grade for the strength for each recommendation. The GRADE system uses the following four domains to assess the strength of each recommendation: [15 ] Balance of desirable and undesirable outcomes Confidence in the quality of the evidence Values and preferences Other implications, as appropriate, e.g.,: Resource u se Equity Acceptability Feasibility Subgroup considerations The following sections further describe each domain. Balance of desirable and undesirable outcomes refers to the size of anticipated benefits (e.g., increased longevity, reduction in morbid event, resolution of symptoms, improved QoL, decreased resource use) and harms (e.g., decreased longevity, immediate serious complications, adverse event, impaired quality of life, increased resource use, inconvenience/hassle) relative to each other. This domain is based on the understanding that the majority of clinicians will offer patients therapeutic or preventive measures as lon g as the advantages of the intervention exceed the risks and adverse effects. The certainty or uncertainty of the clinician about the risk -benefit balance will greatly influence the strength of the recommendation. Some of the discussion questions that fall under this domain include: Given the best estimate of typical values and preferences, are you confident that the benefitsoutweigh the harms and burden or vice versa? Are the desirable anticipated effects large? Are the undesirable anticipated effects sma ll? Are the desirable effects large relative to undesirable effects?VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in Primary Care April 2017 Page 77 of 160 Confidence in the quality of the evidence reflects the quality of the evidence base and the certainty in that evidence. This second domain reflects the methodological quality of the studi es for each outcome variable. In general, the strength of recommendation follows the level of evidence, but not always, as other domains may increase or decrease the strength. The evidence review used for the development of recommendations for DM, conducte d by ECRI, assessed the confidence in the quality of the evidence base and assigned a rat ing of \"High,\" \"Moderate,\" \"Low ,\" or \"Very Low.\" The elements that go into the confidence in the quality of the evidence include: Is there high or moderate quality e vidence that answers this question? What is the overall certainty of this evidence? Values and preferences is an overarching term that includes patients' perspectives, beliefs, expectations, and goals for health and life. More precisely, it refers to the p rocesses that individuals use in considering the potential benefits, harms, costs, limitations, and inconvenience of the therapeutic or preventive measures in relation to one another. For some, the term \"values\" has the closest connotation to these process es. For others, the connotation of \"preferences\" best captures the notion of choice. In general, values and preferences increase the strength of the recommendation when there is high concordance and decrease it when there is great variability. In a situati on in which the balance of benefits and risks are uncertain, eliciting the values and preferences of patients and empowering them and their surrogates to make decisions consistent with their goals of care becomes even more important. A recommendation can b e described as having \"similar values,\" \"some variation,\" or \"large variation\" in typical values and preferences between patients and the larger populations of interest. Some of the discussion questions that fall under the purview of values and preferences include: Are you confident about the typical values and preferences and are they similar across the target population? What are the patient's values and preferences? Are the assumed or identified relative values similar across the target population? Othe r implications consider the practicality of the recommendation, including resource use, equity, acceptability, feasibility , and subgroup considerations. Resource use is related to the uncertainty around the cost- effectiveness of a therapeutic or preventive measure. For example statin use in the frail elderly and others with multiple co -occurring conditions may not be effective and , depending on the societal benchmark for willingness to pay, may not be a good use of resources. Equity, acceptability, feasibility , and subgroup considerations require similar judgments around the practically of the recommendation. The framework below was used by the Work Group to guide discussions on each domain. VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in Primary Care April 2017 Page 78 of 160 Table A -7. Evidence to Recommendation Framework Decision Domain Judgment Balance of desirable and undesirable outcomes Given the best estimate of typical values and preferences, are you confident that the benefits outweigh the harms and burden or vice versa? Are the desirable anticipated effects large? Are the undesirable anticipated effects small? Are the desirable effects large relative to undesirable effects?Benefits outweigh harms/ burden Benefits slightly outweigh harms/burden Benefits and harms/burden arebalanced Harms/burden slightly outweighbenefits Harms/burd en outweigh benefits Confidence in the quality of the evidence Is there high or moderate quality evidence that answers this question? What is the overall certainty of this evidence?High Moderate Low Very low Values and preferences Are you confident about the typical values and preferences and are they similar across the target population? What are the patient's values and preferences? Are the assumed or identified relative values similar across the target population?Similar values Some variation Larg e variation Other implications (e.g., resource use, equity, acceptability, feasibility, subgroup considerations) Are the resources worth the expected net benefit from the recommendation? What are the costs per resource unit? Is this intervention generally available? Is this intervention and its effects worth withdrawing or not allocating resources from other interventions? Is there lots of variability in resource requirements across settings?Various considerations The str ength of a recommendation is defined as the extent to which one can be confident that the desirable effects of an intervention outweigh its undesirable effects and is based on the framework above, which combines the four domains. [15] GRADE methodology does not allow for recommendations to be made based on expert opinion alone. While strong recommendations are usually based on high or moderate confidence in the estimates of effect (quality of the evidence) there may be instances where strong recommendations are warranted even when the quality of evidence is low. [ 178] In these types of instances wher e the balance of desirable and undesirable outcomes and values and preferences played large roles in determining the strength of a recommendation, this is explained in the discussion section for the recommendation. The GRADE of a recommendation is based on the following elements: Four decision domains used to determine the strength and direction (described above) Relative strength (Strong or Weak) Direction (For or Against)VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in Primary Care April 2017 Page 79 of 160 The relative strength of the recommendation is based on a binary scale, \"Strong\" or \"Weak.\" A strong recommendation indicates that the Work Group is highly confident that desirable outcomes outweigh undesirable outcomes. If the Work Group is less confident of the balance between desirable and undesirable outcomes, they present a weak reco mmendation. Similarly, a recommendation for a therapy or preventive measure indicates that the desirable consequences outweigh the undesirable consequences. A recommendation against a therapy or preventive measure indicates that the undesirable consequence s outweigh the desirable consequences. Using these elements, the grade of each recommendation is presented as part of a continuum: Strong For (or \"We recommend offering this option ...\") Weak For (or \"We suggest offering this option ...\") Weak Against (or \"We suggest not offering this option ...\") Strong Against (or \"We recommend against offering this option ...\") Note that weak (For or Against) recommendations may also be termed \"Conditional,\" \"Discretionary,\" or \"Qualified.\" Recommendations may be conditional based upon patient values and preferences, the resources available, or the setting in which the intervention will be implemented. Recommendations may be at the discretion of the patient and clinician or they may be qualified with an explanation about the issu es that would lead decisions to vary. E. Recommendation Categorization a. Recommendation Categories and Definitions For use in the 2017 DM CPG, a set of recommendation categories was adapted from those used by the United Kingdom National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence .[18,19] These categories, along with their corresponding definitions, were used to account for the various ways in which recommendations could have been updated from the 2010 DM CPG . The categories and defin itions can be found in Table A-8. VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in Primary Care April 2017 Page 80 of 160 Table A -8. Recommendation Categories and Definitions Evid ence Reviewed* Recommendation Category* Definition* Reviewed New- added New recommendation following review of the evidence New- replaced Recommendation from previous CPG that has been carried over to the updated CPG that has been changed following review of the evidence Not changed Recommendation from previous CPG that has been carried forward to the updated CPG where the evidence has been reviewed but the recommendation is not changed Amended Recommendation from the previous CPG that has been carried forward to the updated CPG where the evidence has been reviewed and a minor amendment has been made Deleted Recommendation from the previous CPG that has been removed based on review of the evidence Not reviewed Not changed Recommendation from previous CPG that has been carried forward to the updated CPG, but for which the evidence has not been reviewed Amended Recommendation from the previous CPG that has been carried forward to the updated CPG where the evidence has not been reviewed and a minor amendment has been made Deleted Recommendation from the previous CPG that has been removed because it was deemed out of scope for the updated CPG *Adapted from the NICE guideline manual (2012) [18] and Garcia et al. (2014) [19 ] Abbreviation: CPG: clinical practice guideline b.Categorizing Recommendations with an Updated Review of the Evidence Recommendations were first categorized by whether or not they were based on an updated review of the evidence. If evidence had been reviewed, recommendations were categorized as recommendations were original, new recommendations that were not in the 2010 DM CPG. \"Reviewed, New -replaced\" recommendations were in the previous version of the guideline, but were modified to align with the updated review of the evidence. These recommendations could have also included clinically significant changes to the previous version. Recommendations categorized as \"Reviewed, Not changed\" were carried forward from the previous version of the CPG unchanged. To maintain consistency between 2010 recommendations, which were developed using the USPSTF methodology, and 2017 recommendations, which were developed using the GRADE methodology, it was necessary to modify the 2010 recommendations to include verbiage to signify the strength of the recommendation (e.g., \"We recommend,\" \"We suggest\"). Because the 2010 recommendations inherently needed to be modified at least slightly to include this language, the \"Not changed\" category was not used. For recommendations carried forward to the up dated CPG with review of the evidence and slightly modified wording, the \"Reviewed, Amended\" recommendation category was used. This allowed for the wording of the recommendation to reflect GRADE methodology as well as for any other non-substantive (i.e., n ot clinically meaningful) lan guage changes deemed necessary. The evidence used VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in Primary Care April 2017 Page 81 of 160 to support these recommendations was carried forward from the previous version of the CPG and/or was identified in the evidence review for the update. Recommendations could hav e also been designated \"Reviewed, Deleted.\" These were recommendations from the previous version of the CPG that were not brought forward to the updated guideline after review of the evidence. This occurred if the evidence supporting the recommendations was out of date, to the extent that there was no longer any basis to recommend a particular course of care and/or new evidence suggests a shift in care, rendering recommendations in the previous version of the guideline obsolete. c. Categorizing Recommendations without an Updated Review of the Evidence There were also cases in which it was necessary to carry forward recommendations from the previous version of the CPG without a SR of the evidence. Due to time and budget constraints, the update of the DM CPG coul d not review all available evidence on management of DM , but instead focused its KQs on areas of new or updated scientific research or areas that were not previously covered in the CPG. For areas of research that have not changed, and for which recommendations made in the previous version of the guideline were still relevant, recommendations could have been carried forward to the updated guideline without an updated SR of the evidence. The support for these recommendations in the updated CPG was thus also carried forward from the previous version of the CPG. These recommendations were categorized as \"Not reviewed.\" If evidence had not been reviewed, recommendations could have been categorized as \"Not changed,\" Amended,\" or \"Deleted.\" \"Not reviewed, Not cha nged\" recommendations refer to recommendations from the previous version of the DM CPG that were carried forward unchanged to the updated version. The category of \"Not reviewed, Amended\" was used to designate recommendations which were modified from the 2010 CPG with the updated GRADE language, as explained above. Recommendations could also have been categorized as \"Not reviewed, Deleted\" if they were determined to be out of scope. A recommendation was out of scope if it pertained to a topic (e.g., populat ion, care setting, treatment, condition) outside of the scope for the updated CPG as defined by the Work Group. The categories for the recommendations included in the 2017 version of the guideline are noted in the Recomme ndations . Recommendations 6, 9, 10, 12, 15, 17, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, and 24 were carried forward from the 2010 DM CPG using this method. The categories for the recommendations from the 2010 DM CPG are noted in Appendix F. F. Draft ing and Submitting the Final Clinical Practice Guideline Following the face -to-face meeting, the Champions and Work Group members were given writing assignments to craft discussion sections to support each of the new recommendations and/or to update discus sion sections from the 2010 DM CPG to support the amended \"carried forward\" recommendations. The Work Group also considered tables, appendices, and other sections from the 2010 DM CPG for inclusion in the update . During this time, the Champions and Work Gr oup also made additional revisions to the algorithms , as necessary. VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in Primary Care April 2017 Page 82 of 160 After developing the initial draft of the updated CPG, an iterative review process was used to solicit feedback on and make revisions to the CPG. Once they were developed, the first two d rafts of the CPG were posted on a wiki website for a period of 14 -20 business days for internal review and comment by the Work Group. All feedback submitted during each review period was reviewed and discussed by the Work Group and appropriate revisions we re made to the CPG. Draft 3 of the CPG was made available for peer review and comment. This process is described in Peer Review Process . After revisions were made based on the feedback received during the peer review and comment period, the Champions presented the CPG to the EBPWG for their approval. Changes were made based on feedback from the EBPWG and the guideline was finalized. The Work Group also produced a set of guideline toolkit materials which included a prov ider summary, pocket cards, and a patient summary . The final 2017 DM CPG was submitted to the EBPWG in April 2017.

Methods On March 8, 2016, as part of the effort to update this CPG, the VA and DoD Leadership, along with the DM CPG Working Group, held a patient fo cus group at the VA Puget Sound Health Care System American Lake Division. The f ocus group was comprised of five patients. The aim of the focus group was to further the understanding of the perspective of patients receiving treatment for DM within the VA and/or DoD health care systems, as these patients are most affected by the recommendations put forth in the updated DM CPG. The focus group explored patient perspectives on a set of topics related to management of DM in the VA and DoD healthcare systems, including patients' knowledge of DM treatments and alternate treatment options, views on the delivery of care, and the impact of DM on the patients and the challenges it poses. Participants for the focus group were recruited by Eric Rodgers, Director of the Evidence -based Practice Program, Office of Quality, Safety and Value for the Department of Veterans Affairs, Corinne Devlin, Chief, Office of Evidence -Based Practice Clinical Performance Directorate, and by the DM CPG Champions . Patient focus group participants were not intended to be a representative sa mple of VA and DoD patients who have experienced DM. However, recruitment focused on eliciting a range of perspectives likely to be relevant and informative in the guideline development process. Patients were not incentivized for their participation or rei mbursed for travel expenses. The DM CPG Champions and Work Group developed a set of questions to help guide the focus group. The facilitator from Lewin led the discussion using interview questions prepared by the Work Group as a general guide to elicit the most important information from the patients regarding their experiences and views about their treatment and overall care. Given the limited time and the range of interests of the focus group participants, not all of the listed questions were addressed. At the time of the focus group, all five patients were receiving care in the VA healthcare system. Some of these patient participants had transitioned between multiple care settings, including from DoD to VA. The time since patients had been diagnosed with DM ranged from three weeks to 25 years at the time of the focus group. All patients had T2 DM. Two patients stated that other members in their family h ad DM as well. One patient stated he was currently on insulin pump therapy . The following concepts are a spects of care that are important to these patients , which emerged from the focus group discussion. Each of these themes was an important and needed aspect of participants' healthcare. VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in Primary Care April 2017 Page 95 of 160 B. Patient Focus Group Findings a.Using shared decision -making, consider all treatment options and develop a treatment plan based on the balance of risks, benefits, and patient- specific goals, values, and preferences Use shared decision -making to develop an individualized treatment plan; discuss pros and cons (e.g., benefits, risks, side effects) of each treatment option in conjunction with each patient's goals, priorities, values, and preferences . Periodically re -evaluate and reassess the patient's medications as new drug formulations and devices are available. Re-evaluation of the side effects and titration of the medicines are important during shared decision -making. Discuss pharmacologic options in depth with the patient, including their willingness to take medications and their preferences for other treatments. b.Guide patients for the self-management of their diabetes and glucose monitoring, including benefits and risks, and their expectations Guide and educate patients on the self -management of their diabetes. Educate patients on the reason for SMBG throughout the day. Cons ider the benefits , risks , and patients' expectations during the self -management of their diabetes. c.Educate and involve family caregivers and co- workers in accordance with patient preferences regarding core knowledge of diabetes management Foster family involvement in shared decision -making and patient support in accordance with patient preferences and in a way that is beneficial to the patient . Educate and i nclude family members early in treatment discussions , especially regarding core knowledge on management of diabetes. Build and maintain trust, respect, and support with the patient and their family . E ducate patients' co -workers on the core knowledge on management of diabetes in accordance with patient preference. d.Within and between VA and DoD healthcare systems, work with appropriateproviders to ensure continuity of high-quality care and timely consult and/orreferral to an endocrinologist as appropriate Clinicians should listen actively and be responsive to each patient's agenda during clinic visits. Provide seamless transitions in DM treatment within and between VA, DoD, and other healthcare systems; patients should not have to encounter delays in diagnosis of DM, changes in treatment regimens, or have to \"start all over\" when moving to another provi der. Provide timely consult and/or referrals to endocrinologists as appropriate.VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in Primary Care April 2017 Page 96 of 160 e.Create a support system for patients with diabetes such as online groups, chats, other support groups, and diabetes education classes to enhance involvement and support among patients with diabetes Inform patients about available resources for DM management such as diabetes education classes. Create a support system in the VA and DoD healthcare systems such as online groups, chats, andother support groups for patients with DM and other co -occurring conditions.VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in Primary Care April 2017 Page 97 of 160 Appendix E : Evidence Table Recommendation 2010 Grade1 Evidence2 Strength of Recommendation3 Recommendation Category4 1.We recommend shared decision -making to enhance patient knowledge and satisfaction.N/A [32] Additional References: [25,26,30,31,33] Strong for Reviewed, New -added 2.We recommend that all patients with diabetes should be offered ongoing individualized diabetes self -management education via various modalities tailored to their preferences , learning needs and abilities based on available resources.I None [34-38,40-44] Additional Reference: [39] Strong for Reviewed, New -replaced 3.

Inclusion of more than one 2010 Grade indicates that more than one 2010 CPG recommendation is covered under the 2017 recommendation. The strength of recommendations were rated as follows: A - a strong recommendation that the clinicians provide the intervention to eligible patients; B - a recommendation that clinicians provide (the service) to eligible patients; C- no recommendation for or against the routine provision of the intervention is made; D - recommendation is made against routinely providing the intervention; I - the conclusion is that the evidence is insufficient to recommend for or against routinely providing the intervention. \" None\" indicates that the 2017 DM CPG recommendati on replaced or amended a 2010 DM CPG recommendation for which there was no grade. \"N/A\" indicates that the 2017 DM CPG recommendation was a new recommendation, and therefore does not have an associated 2010 Grade. 2 The evidence column indicates studies that support each recommendation. For new recommendations, developed by the 2017 guideline Work Group, the literature cited corresponds directly to the 2016 evidence review. For recommendations that have been carried over from the 2010 VA/DoD DM CPG, slight modifications were made to the language in order to better reflect the current evidence and/or the change in grading system used for assigning the strength of each recommendation (USPSTF to GRADE). For these \"modified\" recommendations, the evidence column indicates \"additional evidence,\" which can refer to either 1) studies that support the recommendation and which were identified through the 2016 evidence review, or 2) relevant studies that support the recommendation, but which were not systematically identified through a literature review . 3 Refer to the Grading Recommendations section for more information on how the strength of the recommendation was determined using GRADE methodology . 4 Refer to the Recommendation Categorization section for more information on the description of the categorization process and the definition of each category.
