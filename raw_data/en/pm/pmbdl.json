A virus is something that can make people sick. By being brave, we can help defeat a virus, you probably know, it's a virus called COVID-19. To try to stop people from catching and getting sick from COVID-19, we've all had to make some changes. We wash our hands more, wear a mask, and we stay home if we're not feeling well. Now there's a way to help stop people getting sick from COVID-19. It's called a vaccine. You've probably had a few before for things like chickenpox. A vaccine is a medicine that helps protect you and the people you love from viruses. It helps teach your body how to fight the virus, so you don't get sick. Just like a superpower. Getting a vaccine, it's super quick. Some kids say they don't feel it. Some say it's like a little sting. And some say it hurts a bit. Tell your nurse or doctor how it felt for you. If you want to you can sit on a grownup's lap to get your vaccine and have a hug. Or you can even watch a favourite song or show. It's okay to feel a bit worried. That will be over before you know it. And then you'll feel super brave for helping protect everyone from COVID-19. Let's do this.
